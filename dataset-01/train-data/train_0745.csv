3,Should be titled accidents in USA - not North America,"I was dissapointed. Specifically ordered the book to review accidents in Canada, and upon opening the first page found out that there is only one report from Canada, apparently the Alpine Club of Canada is looking for a new editor. This would have been nice to know prior to ordering the book. Should have been titled Accidents in United States Mountaineering."
1,I remember reading this in 1981 or 1982...,"I have to disagree with the review above. I read this book when it first came out in the early 80s and thought it was contrived and a bad William Goldman knockoff! Even as a very young man I could sniff that much out. Skip this and read ""Boys of Brazil"", ""Marathon Man"", or ""Magic."""
4,Wonderful collectible book,This book is addictive and we had trouble putting it down. We have already lent it to several friends. It's well put together and even had some things we didn't even know about. It gives you a great idea of what to look for if you are a collector and also what value your current items are worth.Definetly a great purchase for a Star Wars fan of anykind.
5,The best Star Wars collecting guide ever produced .,"I Have been a collector for many years now , and have bought every guide ever produced . This guide written by Mr Carlton is by far the best of them all , I was pleasantly suprised by the content , layout and size of this book .It is huge and made me realize just how many holes i have in my collection .I recommend this book to one and all , don't miss out on this book .As a guide it is by far the most modern and the best. It will be extremly useful to the collector for years to come ."
2,Fantasy Football Made Simple,"This is a good book if you are a fantasy football novice that wants to learn how to set up a non-computerized league. All the basics are covered, but that's about it. Experienced players won't find anything interesting except perhaps the cartoons and old photographs of players that are scattered through the book along with historical tidbits about the NFL."
4,CD Burner too!,Just pop some cd's into the slots and it burns them up real nice. Kind of makes a mess and is real smokey though...
1,What ? No Alarm Feature?,"All I ever want in life is a toaster with an alarm radio. That way I can wake up each day to my favorite tunes and toasted bread! This comes close, but I guess I will have to wait."
4,Good consistant Toast,"I love it. My wife loves it. It is entertaining.Come on, for this much money, it better toast well and it does. I dont know how making toast can get any fancier. It is big enough for regular bagels too.Now that Howard Stern is on satellite though, we have been less excited about this purchase. We got it to just get rid of extra stuff in our small kitchen.The best comment anyone has ever made about my toaster:"" What a concept. I duct taped my toaster to my radio. I had planned to kill myself today but now I have a reason to live for tomorrow."""
4,I love my radio toaster!!,"The Radio Toaster is a really good toaster...probably the best toaster I've ever had. It is a so-so radio, though...the speakers are necessarily not very large and the sound it emits is rather tinny.BUT, I just keep in mind that it's a TOASTER first, and a radio secondarily. The radio controls are, ummm, primitive, but perhaps that is for a reason---all radios usually are affected by electrical appliances running close by to them, so maybe overcoming that interference necessitates the non-sophisticated radio controls. I do notice that when I run a blender nearby the radio transmission is silenced.Let's face it, it's a gimmicky appliance. But I love it. I can have my radio on right by the stove while I'm cooking, and hear it well, and not bother someone watching TV in the next room. I've developed a great affection for the thing!!!So. A terrific toaster. A so-so radio. A gimmicky gadget that is easy to love! :)"
3,Kemwood TT756SL not in tune,"Very poor quality radio, about the same as a crystal radio of times gone by. As a toaster, it toasts two pieces of bread just like a regular cheap toaster."
2,fried,"The toast didn't pop up all the way. You had to reach something in to get it out. The radio doesn't display the station numbers, and you have to reset the station each time you turn it on. I was unhappy, and returned it."
1,JUNK,"Well this was just weird enough for me and I ordered it.It is utter and complete junk. I feel really ripped off at 29 bucks....heaven help the people who paid 99.I guess the Kenwood people just went along with it. The radio is the worst consumer radio I have ever heard! It sounds worse than a $3 transistor radio you might get at the Dollar store. That is not an exaggeration. It has no dial or station display - you just push the seek button untill you get a acceptable station. When you turn it off, it forgets and you start the process again. It is not a radio that you could actually functionally use - even to listen to the news while your breakfast bagel heats up."
3,Lowepro Orion AW,"Very nice pack, but - way too bulky for the trail. Ended up sending it back. Such is the hazard when buying unseen."
2,Mediocre Picture Book,"I expected a book with insightful narrative and intriguing photographs about what goes on behind the motorcycle racing scene. Instead this work offers virtually no narrative and really mediocre photographs. It's a big, expensive photo album that illustrates the motorcycle racing pit scene without explaining what you're seeing. The captions for all the photos are at the end of the book, which is cumbersome, and the editor left out narrative for some photos and mislabeled others.If you're looking for the scoop on the grunge behind the glitz of motorcycle racing, this will not satisfy you at all. If you're looking for outstanding photography, you'll be disappointed as well. Save your money; there are better books in this genre out there."
1,Not what I was looking for,I would like to be able to know more about a video before I purchase it. this was not at all what I was looking for and the picture did not tell me very much. I was disappointed. I have purchased two other videos from this site that gave me no information on what I was getting and I am going to send them back.Jerri Barrett
4,My daughter loves this vide0,"My daughter who is now 2 1/2. Loved watching this video from 1 year until now. Her hebrew is excellent and I think alot has to do with these types of video which are filled with songs, kids and the hebrew language."
1,Best of Barney,27 Sept 2012 Video was not good quality at all. Picture was so light I could barely see at times; I would not recommend this for anyone else's review/purchse.
3,"Great Series,Weaker Volume","By all means pick up as many of the Pebbles Volumes as you can if you crave wild 60's garage rock. However #3 (here with some bonus tracks not on my vinyl version)is not one of the better ones that I own.It's less rock and roll, and more psychedelic arty noise. It does have a few real gems especially The Jefferson Hankerchiefs' ""I'm Allergic To Flowers"" and William Penn IV's ""Swami""."
1,Sucks,"This guy is my 7th grade music teacher in P.V.C middle school croton on hudson ny. This guy is really bad at singing and is worse at making cds. no kid over 3 would like this cd. P.S i know you think that this review dosnet matter because im in 7th grade and im too old for the cd anyway and im giving him a bad reveiw because i dont like the guy in person, but im telling the truth, dont waste your money. Quote- ""this cd sucks"" 35 of my little brothes classmates (kindergardners)Matt d. a.k.a matt doody"
1,Disappointing!,"Bought this butane soldering iron 16 months ago. Initially I was quite pleased and it worked great! This past month I began to have trouble lighting it. (Couldn't hear any gas.) After checking it, the butane was full. The next use I waa unable to light it. It was out of warranty and not working. Tried to find online support and wasted a lot of time! Went to Home Depot and bought a butane soldering iron for $15 and it's working great!"
3,not much better than my previous 5 year old Satellite,"I expected a quantum leap, compared to my previous Satellite (which I loved ), and was initially disappointed. This one has tons of RAM and a big hard drive, but does not run any faster. It does run a lot cooler, though. I don't think I like the new ultra bright screen as much as the old type. It has a shiny surface that catches a lot of reflections (kind of like a plasma vs LCD tv screen). I am using this computer to run memory hungry programs (eg Adobe Lightroom), and it does seem to run quite well. This is my 3rd Satellite - I have had good luck w/ Toshiba."
1,Please avoid.,"Lovers of the great, tender Weil will have no need for this little book. The danger here lies in a reader new to Weil, picking this up, reading it, and struggling with Gray's simplistic, biased agenda concerning Weil's abandonment of leftist politics(not true), hatred of sex and romance(not true), defaming and misuse of Jewish thought and history(certainly not true). In fact, du Plessix Gray spends more time celebrating Simone Weil as a sort of 1930s French version of the hideous David Horowitz(once left, now far right), then she does helping the reader understand the heart and soul of Weil's holiness and unending compassion. So don't waste your time here. Rather, try instead: Jacques Cabaud's ""Simone Weil: a Fellowship in Love""; Simone Petrement's ""Simone Weil: A Life""; or, ""Simone Weil: A Sketch of a Portrait"" by Richard Rees."
2,good information yet without the soul,"If this is all you hear about dear little Simone, you will miss a great deal. The author seems to miss the profound paradox of her work and vision, choosing rather to engage in easy modern psychology. Read Simone! It is precisely the discomfort that she longs to cause that is her enduring message."
5,an excellent biography of a flawed philosopher,"Francine Du Plessix Gray has done a phenomenal job in distilling the life and and thoughts of Simone Weil. Most importantly, while illuminating the experiences, insights, and influences of the noted French philosopher, Du Plessix Gray has not shied away from Weil's darker sides, including her virulent Jewish self-hatred. It is sad that such a deep thinker could be so blind to the suffering of her fellow Jews when they faced the greatest catastrophe in their history. This is a book to be read not only for those who wish to understand modern French thought, but also for those who need to understand the limits of the intellect as well."
4,Garrett sand scoopScoop,"Scoop is made of good grade material and well constucted. Not sure if rivets are stainless,but if they rustout, can easily be replaced with stainless bolts. I also found the supplier most accomodating."
2,Poor Design,"First off, this set is not interactive. You set it up and the trains run around on the track loading and unloading balls. Fun to watch for 10 minutes, if it worked.There is a design flaw that causes the balls that drop from the hopper into Percy to miss his bucket. They end up scattering all over the place. I guess you could consider interactive since you have to chase them and put them back in the set.Second is the size of the balls. The set is for ages 3+, but I have caught both my 2 and 4 year old with the balls in their mouths. These are definite choking hazards. Do not let your kids play with it unsupervised.The set was given to us as a gift. I would not buy or recommend this product to others."
1,Awful,"This toy is awful! It does not stay on the track, the directions are terrible and do not show you how to arrange pieces! Track comes apart too easily with the tiniest bump. WASTE OF MONEY."
4,Could watch for hours!,"Is really neat set that is mesmerizing for our 4 ,2, and 1 year old. (Mom and Dad too!) Important for all the pieces to be put together and lined up well, but can be put together fairly easily (by Mom and Dad) just looking at the pictures. Instructions could be a little more detailed, but not a show stopper. One battery (that seems to last forever) is a great thing. While it doesn't give the opportunity to reconfigure anything, the boys seem to like looking at how everything works and the mechanics of every transition.Took playing with a few times before stumbling across the solution to the mail (ball) drop issue. Only one of the curved pieces has raised gear teeth and this piece has to be placed before the mail drop - doing so will slow Percy down so the drop hits the hopper perfectly every time. Was frustrating before, but now works like a dream."
4,Great Entertainment that uses only 1 battery!,"This toy is a motorized train set so it is not meant for imaginative play. My three year old son just loves this set! There is so much going on with Thomas, Percy and Harold that he doesn't seem to ever get bored with it. The only thing is that the track pieces do come apart easily, and it should be put up from smaller children. Of all the remote control cars and other battery operated toys, This one does not eat through the batteries. With all the hours of ENTERTAINMENT that you and your child get, it only requires 1 AA battery that lasts a long time. The set does need to be PERFECTLY put together or will will not not work right. (I found that out finally :)...) I found it to be a great birthday gift. Might be better for children a little older than 3."
3,Not much for your money,I have to say I was not impressed with this Thomas set. 'Thomas' gets stuck a lot and has to be reset. I felt it really wasn't worth $40
2,cute but frustrating,"This toy is a wonderful idea...when it works, it really is amazing to see Thomas, Percy, and Harold working together. However, that doesn't happen often: the track pieces are hard to fit together, Harold has to be placed just so on top of the post office, some of the support pieces slip loose...in short, if it isn't put together *perfectly*, it doesn't work. Add to this an excited three year old who really wants to help (and at that age doesn't have the manual dexterity to do so), and you've got a great idea, but a bad toy."
4,The girls from Shotz,"Its great to fianlly have this series in my collection. The only drawback from this dvd release is that its missing bonus footage which was never to be included anyway. Would have been great to have had some behind the scense footage, bloopers, actor bios, and commentaries. Maybe before the series reaches completion on dvd we will see such bonuses."
2,"Five, Six, Seven, Hate","This series is the drek of classic television. If you were an alien and you landed on Earth, you would think all television made before 1980 was gold. Judging by the reviews here I can see people seem to enjoy this show and thats fine, but FIVE STARS?? All in the Family, Mash, Twilight Zone, and very few others are truly five stars, I think people need to face that. Laverne & Shirley, Soap, Maude and many many spin offs of the 70's are simply and utterly terrible. I wouldn't go so far to say that about L&S, it does have a sort of working class charm but it is and always will be second rate, no make that third. Boo Boo Kitty, indeed."
1,THIS SHOW IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THERE ARE SO MANY SHOWS THAT BELONG ON DVD THAT PARAMOUNT HAS ACCESS TO. PARAMOUNT DECIDES TO PUT THIS IDIOT SHOW ON DVD. HAPPY IS A SHOW WELL WORTH BEING PUT ON DVD, NOT THIS SHOW. LAVERNE & SHIRLEY WAS NOT FUNNY. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY."
4,"Good, clean laughs. Brings you back ...","Watching these old shows is fun. In comparison to viewing these episodes on television, they contain more than what we were shown when they aired."
4,Love it!,I love this show!! Cindy Wlliams and Penny Marshall are amazing together. This show makes me laugh non stop. It's as good today as it was when I was a kid.
3,Edited?,"I love the show - in fact, I'd buy all the seasons up until the ""California"" years; but in watching these episodes, I'm wondering if these prints came from an early edit for daily stripping? It just seems like there are missing lines of dialogue here and there; wasn't that multi-colored ""dissolve"" (or whatever the term is) technique for switching scenes added to bridge the editing for M-F daytime airings on ABC back in the early 80's? I did not buy the ""Happy Days"" set, but the technique I refer to was used there, as well. Anyway, that, and the lack of extras prevent me from giving this set 5 stars."
4,Great Transfer!,"I bought the first season, and as a loyal ""L&S"" fan, I will buy them all...even the California seasons and the last season, when it was ""Laverne & Shirley"" without Shirley!!! I give the first discs 4 stars due to no extras, but what a BEAUTFUL picture. I expected a grainy transer...not something that looked like it was filmed an hour ago. I cannot wait for 2-8!!"
5,Are they ever going to release another season???????,"Season 1 is 3 disc and contains the complete first 15 episodes:DISC 11. The Society Party2. The Bachelor Party3. Bowling for Razzberries4. A Nun's Story5. Falter at the AlterDISC 21. Dog Day Blind Days2. Once apon a Rumor3. One Flew Over Milwaukee4.Dating Slump5. It's the WaterDisc 31. Fakeout at the Stakeout2. Hi, Neighbor3. How Do You Say ""Are You Dead"" in German?4. From the Suds to Stardom5. Mother Knows WorstLaverne(Penny Marshall) & Shirley (Cindy Williams) are roommates,best friends and both work at SHOTZ Brewery in Milwaukee. The pair get themselves into all kinds of hilarious situations which will keep you laughing for hours. The show is a spin-off from Happy Days.I'm still waiting for Paramont to release a second season, It would be sad to see such a great show to only have one season come out. Laverne and Shirley is by far the best show ever!"
5,Laverne & Shirley - The Complete First Season,I can't wait until my video comes in I love the movie and I've seen some episodes of it but the show is very funny.
4,Why Is Paramount Editing These Programs?,"Whether it's Laverne and Shirley or The Andy Griffith Show, why are these shows being edited? I think that the people who buy them just want to see the original productions, as they were originally aired on television, no more and no less. When I heard that The Andy Griffith Show was being released as a complete set, I started saving my money. When it became known that the shows were edited, I didn't buy the set. I tried to contact Paramount through their website, but I couldn't find a 'contact us' option.If anyone from Paramount is reading this, please read our input: We just want to see what we originally saw. It doesn't need to be revised unless there is some legal situation preventing an exact reproduction of the original broadcast. It ain't broke; if you don't fix it, you will make lots of money."
5,Where are the other seasons?,I have thoroughly enjoyed the first season of Laverne and Shirley and cannot understand why additional seasons are not being produced on DVD. The show definitely improved in the subsequent seasons even though I agree with the customer who didn't particularly care for the California installments. Please bring me SOON some more episodes of those silly girls who made me laugh and reminded me of a simpler and more innocent time.
5,Love It,"I absolutely love the zany girls from the brewery! Situational and physical comedy abound in this DVD set of the first season. Who can forget ""Jiffy Cleaners"" or rumor that Shirley was a ""fun date""? Phoenix and kleenex don't rhyme. This is light, madcap fun but not just for the nostalgic. My kids love it, too."
5,Great addition,The Delta transfer tank was a great addition for my 99 super-duty.Well-bit and great fit.They make a add on great toolbox for this tank that Amazon should put on site.
2,boring!,"This game is a snorefest. I got this for a 7 year old girl who likes Bratz and ponies. I played it for a little bit and the little games/missions are so infantile and uninteresting. It makes use of the stylus, e.g. using a needle to string up beads, using the stylus to clean up the horses. It lacks adventure and a general sense of purpose. The music makes me want to go to sleep too. I should've just gotten any of the mario games or even pokemon."
3,DS game,daughter likes it gets a little tiresome going from island to island to collect jewels or whatever
2,no gromet for hanging,"This towel does not wash well. The fabric hangs onto grass clippings. Besides, there is not way to attach it to a golf bag."
3,Mixed feelings,I loved Marco's scores for the Scream series and I thought that T3 was a bit underwhelming. But this score shows he is one of the best of the young guns out there although the overall feeling of the score was that it is just not that memorable. I think we have yet to hear the best from Marco Beltrami. I look forward to his next score.
3,"decent, functional score","the score did its job, so it's a total success from that point of view . it seems like there isn't a lot of room for innovative musical exploration within this genre of film; however, i felt that the action-type sequences were over the top, while the romantic, ""emotional"" material could not be developed as much. (which appeals to viewers and definitely supports the picture well.) i respect beltrami, and, again, the score is an admirable action score with occasional flourishes of emotion."
4,stargazer,"This has to be the best album Rainbow has ever done,I first bought the album in 1980 and i must have listened to the album more than a thousand times by now,(this is the 5th time i have bought the album due to wear & tear)If you are truly a Rainbow fan this album is a must to any record collection Deep Purple have (smoke on the water) as there anthem (Stargazer) is Rainbows"
3,It's OK.,"The songs are awesome, but the production is not that good. It's an old album so it is good for its age. But very nice album."
3,Good cd,I like Rainbow but tbeir so.gs are basically the same format. If you like Dio then get this but it gets old.fast.
4,"The best, youngest DIO.","This is the best, youngest, DIO tracks. If you would like to have one album that captures DIO's full potential, and demonstrates his rarely heard higher ranges, this is the one.""Stargazer"" is real genius. Its one of those tunes that all the right chemistry and energy combined at the same time and moment to create PERFECT art. You have NEVER heard DIO sing like this before."
5,1 star for each song.,"But, unfortunately I can only give it five. This album is a classic, right up there with Machine Head. ""Tarot Woman"" is an awesome opener. ""Run With the Wolf"" rocks along and is one of those songs that just gets stuck in your head. ""Starstruck"" is pretty good too. ""Do You Close Your Eyes"" isn't quite as good as the rest of the album, but excellent none the less. The real highlight of the album is ""Stargazer."" Wow. Wow. WOW. It left me stunned and speechless the first time I heard it. An epic in its own right. ""A Light in the Black"" is a great finisher for Rainbow's best album. Long Live Rock and Roll is a close second to this one. Rising is an essential must-have in any rock collection, especially for Deep Purple fans and people who don't own it. Verdict: Buy two."
3,Hardly worth while,"I got it today and, basically, you wind up listening to the same stuff 3 times. OK, the rough mix of Stargazer has a keyboard intro (not exactly going into the song smoothly, it might as well have been recorded later and just thrown in front of it). The tour rehearsal version of Stargazer is lukewarm at best, with Ronnie not going full out on the high bits, and the whole thing going ever more out of key towards the end.Why three stars? Those are for the quality of the original album. I'd suggest getting the original."
4,Rainbow - 'Rising' (Polydor),"Originally released in 1976,this is the follow-up to their debut 'Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow' album(see my review).Didn't realize it until now,but this second effort brought in keyboardist Tony Carey,bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Cozy Powell(R.I.P.)to the band's line-up,joining Blackmore and vocalist Ronnie James Dio.Best tunes here include ""Tarot Woman"",the classic ""Stargazer""(some might think it's title is ""Where Is Your Soul?"") and ""A Light In The Black"".Notice the playing here is rather.I've heard several patrons compare 'Rising' to that of classic Deep Purple."
3,Okay,"Not the classic everyone says it is, but it's not bad. The two best cuts are the two long ones -- ""Stargazer"", which is as lush and operatic as you could want, and ""A Light in the Black"", which is the only time that the band actually engages in some instrumental byplay. The rest is pretty tired, though."
5,I See A Rainbow Rising,The best Rainbow album ever and possibly Blackmore's best work. Stargazer is worth the price of the cd alone. Cozy Powell plays the heaviest drums of his career... BUY IT NOW!!!
5,Simply essential,"Blackmore underrated, eh? Not by himself, certainly. Still, this stands with Sabbath's Heaven and Hell as the best setting for Dio's dark, other-worldly lyrics and dramatic delivery. Put aside prejudices about Seventies pomp-rock ('cos it's certainly that) and enjoy it for what it is."
1,Save Your Money,"I usually don't write reviews but I felt that this needed to be said. The first disc features two versions of the great 1976 Rising album ""remastered"" in different ways and neither seems to get it right. The 'new york mix' is supposed to be the original mix featured on the original release but is so totally devoid of any bass it's difficult to listen to...even when compared to the 1999 remaster. What gives? The 'los angeles' mix on the other hand is so bass heavy it buries Blackmore's guitar. The second disc is strickly for die hards... rough mixes. I doubt the biggest Rainbow fans in world would listen to this more than a couple of times.All things considered I would be happy to stick with the '99 remaster and save the money."
4,A nice representation of the character,"Reptile is the third most popular ninja in Mortal Kombat. He also falls third again behind Scorpion and Sub-Zero as an action figure. The figure is based off Reptile's appearance in Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, a small role, but a great scene. Reptile is a tough, and very quick hand-to-hand fighter (probably the quickest of all MK warriors).The figure has nice detail, plenty of accessories (including an alternate head with his trademark long snake tongue) and can be placed in many different poses. The reason I give it a four and not a five is because the sculpted version that was done as the preview figure was much more detailed, so seeing that, I saw how good this figure COULD have been. It's still good, but the original sculpt was fantastic.On a sidenote, I hope they release a Reptile figure in human form."
5,The Ataris Rock!,I saw The Ataris live at the House of Blues in Hollywood when they opened for MxPx and they were awesome. They sing just as well live as they do on their cd. Although this album only has 6 songs they're all really good. If you like punk in any way you'll like this cd
4,"For an EP, this is great","I used to never know who the Ataris were. Then one day at the rcord store. I saw this EP ""look forward to failure"". I figured ""What can I lose? it's only 5.99"". Little did I know there was soo much that i could gane, and did with this EP. With such power-punk-emo songs as ""San Dimas high school football rules"". Which is a tale of him taking a girl to Las Vegas and wishing he could be with her for the rest of his life. Also, ""my So-called life"" when he will do anything just to get the girls attention. This is not just the typical emo album with the high whiny voices, and the slow acoustic guitars. It's no Dashboard Confessional album. It has fast power-packed guitars and heavy riffs. This is truly the best EP I own. And it got me hooked on the Ataris. It will do the same for you too......"
5,This is the best Ataris CD i have!,"If you can buy one cd this summer buy The Ataris:looking Forward to Failure. I have had the cd for about 6 months and i still listen to the cd once a week. I have all The Ataris cds and so far this is the best one. Even though this cd has 6 songs, it still is a great cd and will be stuck in your head all day. The Ataris is an awesome band and i hope they make more cds likes this one. The best song is ""Not a Worry in the World."""
1,battery power,Sorry to say but this battery would not hold a charge.Do not know what to do with it now
3,Battery never completely charges,I purchased this battery aprox. two mounths ago and the battery has never completely charged. I have exhausted the batterys limits and again charged it over night and the indicator is still red. The battery is not hot but warm. I do believe I may have a faulty battery as it runs only for a few hours. With regret:BLittle-N.B.-Pennsylvania
5,Battery met needs,Needed a new battery for our older model Sony camcorder and found this on amazon for a lot less than I was told at stores in my area.
2,Watch out for the red eye!,"This is an ok camera, definetly a good deal money wise. The only problem I have with it is that the red eye in the pictures is HORRIBLE. It cannot be removed on half of the pictures. It does have a red eye reduction built into the camera, but I find that it takes to long to take the picture that way, and the multiple flashes for it is confusing, most people turn away thinking the picture is over before it actually is. I find it easier to just take the picture normally and fix the red eye on the computer. However, on more that half of the pictures I have taken with this camera, I cannot fix the red eye. The eyes either stay red, turn yellow/green, or turn a weird mixture of grey and who knows what else. It is the same no matter which program I try and I have tried about 6 or 7 different ones. I have never had this problem with any other digital camera.Watch out for the red eye with this camera! If it doesn't bother you than buy this camera."
3,Good but a pain,"I got this camera as a gift for Christmas last year and I was happy that i got it. the only thing that i have to complain about about this camera is the fact that it eats the battery up like there is no tomorrow. i can't tell you how many batteries i went through so that I can use the camera. and also the flash takes a long time to charge up and that really mad the people i was trying to take a picture of very irritated. Though it has its flaws, the camera is overall a good camera. it takes very good pictures and they are as clear as day. But I just feel this isn't the camera for me and that's why I'm about to buy another one."
2,this camera is a pain,"My mother gave me this camera on a trip we took out of the country, this camera ate through batteries like nobodies business, also half my pictures would come out very grainy looking. then, if you don't use a case for this camera and just slip it in your purse the cover on the front will slide open in your bag and start eating batteries. and finally without me touching any of the settings the camera would decide to have a very long exposure time making it nearly impossible not to take blurry photos. in short save yourself a lot of trouble and find another camera."
3,"Decent pics, good price","I've had this HP Photosmart E317 for almost two years. Use it for taking still pictures of items I auction online. For this and for distance shots, it's alright. For close-ups, not so great...just can't get the nitty-gritty details. Like others have said, alkaline battery life is lousy though double when you're not using the flash. Display is clear; it's easy to use; settings are adequate; downloading easy; price was right. Don't expect professional grade pics from this. As a backup or for a camera you won't have to worry about, this will work."
2,You pay for what you get,"First of all, I have use a digital camera for a while now and I have a Sony P-71 and love it. I was thinking to get a simple one for my mom and went crazy on the Black Friday shopping and got this camera from Walmart for $88. I was thinking wow! for 5 mega pixel, this is a really good price. Well..you really get what you pay for. I tried it and I just can't seem to get it to stable while trying to take a picture. The LCD make me dizzy looking at it while trying to take picture. It move like a boat and I can't really tell when I take the picture whether it is in focus or not.Here are some of my findings and I have to say I may take it back and get my mom a sony for a little more moneyPro: compact, light weight, good resolution, internal memory (16MB), under $100, can take video with audio.Cons: Not a lot of functions build in. The LCD don't focus very well (move around like a slow motion movie..make me dizzy!)All in all, it is probably a good camera for a starter."
5,She's still the queen,"Dame Joan, you're still prima donna assoluta. Even with impressive competition from Callas, Sills, Caballe, and others. They can't hold a candle to you.You have the best trill,staccato,runs,arpeggios,and the most spectacular high notes in the world. And you have the most gorgeous tone as well.On top of all that, you have a heart of gold. Now that's something that is unique among prima donnas."
2,Sills can sing and act better than La Stupenda,"Sutherland is overrated when it comes to coloratura. Sills has the best coloratura. Her staccati are lightning-fast. Her arpeggios are unbeatable. Her trill is the tightest in recorded history. Her runs are faster and more accurate than Sutherland's. She is much better at acting than Sutherland is. On top of that, she has a heart of gold. Compare Sutherland's Shadow Song with Sills' version on her ""Sillsiana"" recording and you will see that Sills is the better coloratura. Sills' ""The soldier tir'd"", also on ""Sillsiana"", is faster and much more lively than Sutherland's version on ""The Art of the Prima Donna"". Sills has the best coloratura technique. She is the superior soprano."
5,Celebrate Yourself: Enhacing Your Self Esteem,"Excellent book. I frequently recommend this book to others. Very well written, very thorough. Great information."
4,great,the shoes is just like it look and looks high but it's not that high i am happy with my purchase
3,suitable,i'm somewhat like the other reviewer...these shoes are beautiful but your feet slide in them..i would recommend getting those sole inserts to prevent this from happen...my cousin has a pair and agree to this and the shoes are absolutely wearable with beauty
2,"Beautiful, but uncomfortable....","I just received these beautifully made shoes. However, they are very uncomfortable. I could not walk very far after I first put them on--the leather rubbed on the small extremity toes and the backside came up too high and cut into the back of my ankle. Sadly, I had to return them."
5,Gem of a Book Illuminates a Lost World,"This is the perfect cold weather book just in time for winter.In June, 1930, at 16 Edward Beauclerk Maurice sets off from London on his life-altering journey. From Pargnirtung to Frobisher Bay, he travels to Hudson's Bay Company trading posts around Baffin Island, a Canadian territory just south of Greenland. He is eager for excitement in this new land, but the nave, sheltered, accident-prone teenager has much to learn. Maurice learns the Inuit language and way of life from his new companions. A mutual relationship of love and respect is forged.Maurice departed in 1939 and never returned to the land and people who claimed his heart. But he obviously returned to the Arctic many times in his mind! Embodying a remarkable sense of a lost world, this is a thrilling surprise of a book."
4,"If you like outdoor adveture in the Arctic, this is a great book",I really enjoyed reading about Inuit life back in the early fur trading days.
5,"Clear instructions, quality pictures","This book completes very well the taiji studies, but I accept other people's opinion: the book is not enough. You will need a DVD or following a master's instructions in a real cours, because without it you cannot imagine how it works. But if you have a bit of experience about taiji sword, this book completes very well the studies. For exemple during a cours if I am far from the master I cannot see well how he holds his hand, so at home I can search the position from the book and check myshelf. It is also important that this book shows the martial use of movements. At the cours we study the official competition form of taiji sword and I have to admit, sometimes I do not see the reason of a movement, but this book explains it and after that it is easier to follow the master's instructions."
3,Good applications primer,"This book won't help you learn the forms. Pictures fragment the form into unlinked pieces and it seems the only way to understand what's going on is to know the form already. Descriptions are also extremely cryptic. Practically, I found the book useful for two things only: looking up applications of the movements I knew and well described beginners Qigong exercises. My teacher for some reason favors completely different Qigong set, so it was nice to learn some extras."
5,Excellent Melissa Beck style,"This cd is totally amazing. In a dream ""The Lard"" told me to buy this. I went out and bought the damned thing and now my friends: Jack Burton, Big Bill and myself can't stop dancing in the woods to it. When i was buring an effigy on Miss Ang's lawn with Big Bill we even listened to it. STR is so damned skilled, Melissa Beck style. Still I never have poked his nose though. Just trust me with this one, buy it and dance like a fool."
2,Disappointed!,"I got 2 of these Shakers for my kids, 4 & 7, and I am STILL trying to get music put onto them...UHG! I thought they would be easier to use."
3,too hard to open,this was a neat little thing for my 12 year old son but the thing i don't like is it is not very easy to open the battery compartment. it took 10 minutes to open! just imagine a young kid trying to get it open. overall my son seems to like it but next time i wil just get an ipod much easier to work with.
2,"umm, how does this work?","Heard all these fabulous reviews but right from the start I couldn't get the battery cover off.After 3 different days of trying I finally got it off, but now I can get it to stay back on. Never before having used an MP3 player I can't seem to download any music onto the thing. Someone's coming this weekend so maybe they can help- if not... I don't know. Will let you know."
4,Easy to use kid friendly MP3,"I bought 2 of these for my kids ages 5 and 2 1/2. They both love to have their own ""original"" tunes and be able to listen quietly or out loud. The speaker is great for my 2 year old as the ear phones are a bit big for her ears. One negative is that the unit does ""freeze"" up once-in-a-while (while on) and you have to take apart the unit and take out the batteries and re-insert to fix the problem. Other than that both of my kids love these players and take them everywhere we go. I have a boy and a girl so the pink and blue options were great!"
2,Great in theory,"I had my mom buy this as a Christmas gift for my son. I opened it early to load music on it for him before Christmas. Unfortunately it would never turn on independent of my computer. Please pay attention to the other reviews and DON'T BUY! I hope that Sansa fixes all the bugs, because this is a good item for the little music lover in your life if it actually worked!"
3,"Cute, durable, battery killer - MUCH cheaper elsewhere.","I bought this about three years ago from Toys R Us for $15. It's a great little MP3 player. The built-in speaker makes it nice for my two kids to share or even for just one of them to put on a shelf while playing. It requires a pretty good jolt to change songs via the shaking feature. My 6 year old couldn't really get it. It runs on a single AAA battery, but you'll be lucky to get 12 hours out of that battery.I'd say I got my money's worth as I'm only now considering replacing it. Three years later, the thing just doesn't stay on - even with a new battery. I recently saw this at Toys R Us on clearance for $9.99. I don't know where Amazon gets off selling this for nearly $60."
3,bettter design needed,"I loved the IDEA of this product and my kids do enjoy the built in speaker...but the bottom of the player comes off constantly. That is the cover you take off to synch it with the computer, replace the battery or deal with the SD card....but it would be better if the cover only came off when you WANTED it to instead of falling off at the slightest touch. If the cover was not also connected with a thin plastic piece, we would have lost the cover completely by now :("
3,MP3,Great little player for yougsters. Simple to use. I only rated it 3 stars due to the basic (flat) sound quality from built in speaker. Also the instruction on opening it for battery replacement was unclear. Nonetheless I would purchase another one for my 6 year old.
1,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.,The only music files it reads is mp3. So it was not easy for me at all to get music on to it. All my music was in wma format and nothing would play. I plan on returning. Just to much hassel for me. Not what I expected.
4,Haven't opened yet,This is a Christmas present so it hasn't been opened yet but I did want to say that the company shipped it to me the SAME day I placed the order! This product is sold out everywhere I have looked. So I thank the company SO very much for your tremendous shipping dept!
2,Only MP3???,"This is a terrific product, with great design, but it only plays MP3 files! What's up with that? Most of our favorite songs are MPEG 4. We'd love it to play our contemporary music."
1,Not compatible with music subscription services,Bought this because I already have Napster to go. Won't work with that or Rhapsody. SanDisk people say that it can only paly music ripped from CD. Very unsatisfied!
1,Cute but does not work,"It worked for a very short time, but then all the music just disappeared and it would not sync to my computer after that."
1,2 HUGE problems with this player!!!,"1. It will NOT play any songs purchased from Itunes. (Itunes songs are MP4, but this player ONLY plays MP3 format. Who knew???)2. There is a FUNDAMENTAL, SERIOUS design flaw with this player. If you attempt to rotate/twist the bottom white band (which you must do in order to skip ahead to another song or go backward to a different song), the entire bottom cover of the player FALLS OFF! Seriously, this happens every time. I'm an adult and no matter how careful I am, I simply cannot skip to a different song without the bottom cover falling completely off the player. BTW, I purchased 2 players, and BOTH have this problem."
1,Don't Bother,This is a waste of money. You are better off with one of the inexpensive mini-mp3 players that can be strapped to a child's wrist. Doesn't get lost and isn't so easily damaged that way!
1,good while it worked,"Pros: nice, easy to use, kids loved it, good soundCons: we bought two mp3s player (blue and pink)and one for a niece. All had died almost exactly after 1 yearIt was a good product and the kids loved it until it no longer turned on. We got our money back from Toys r Us"
4,Ts'goood,My 5 year old loves it. 50 year old father had tough time figuring it out. Must be getting old.
4,fun gift for kids but eats batteries,With its external speaker my five year old cant get enough of this mp3 player; so much so that i have to replace the battery every day or two. Thank God it requires just 1 AAA battery.
3,Not easy to download songs,"It is a great idea, but not easy to download the songs to the player. Everytime I was able to put a new song on, one of the songs already on, would be gone. Also, the bottom opens easily. My son enjoys it, so that's all that matters."
1,Do not buy,"I purchased this item for my 4 year old son since he kept trying to take my oldest son's Ipod. I thought it would be kid friendly and he would enjoy it. I was so wrong!! This is so cheap, please do not waste your time and insted buy a mp3 player or Ipod. It is not worth the package it came in."
1,Don't waist your money or time,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and regret it!!!! I have spent countless hours trying to get songs on this shaker - it only accepts mp3 files so if you want to import songs from i-tunes, just forget it! I have also spent countless hours on the phone with customer service - jumping through hoops to try to get it replaced. They have horrible customer service!!! For the number of hours I have spent I would have been much better off buying an ipod instead. If I could charge an hourly rate for all the time I spent working on this it would be well into the hundreds - enough for the top of the line ipod!Don't waist your time or money!"
2,Great for a day,Worked great for one day and then broke. Great design and concept. Music can be played and heard on one headset or two or even out loud on a speaker! Wish it would have lasted longer.
3,great hope,"I bought this for my 6 1/2 year old. It took me a while to figure out how to download songs (but I'm not that tech savy). I love the way she can listen to it without the headphones. Her 4 year old brother threw it on the ground and it now doesn't work. I have purchased another because I believe the product is perfect for my 6 year old, and want to try again. The price is unbeatable."
4,Exceeds expectations!,"We love this, which our 6-year-old received for Christmas. She is very proud to have her own big-kid music player, yet it's more fun than her big sister's! Our only complaint is that you need to reload the playlist every time batteries are changed (which has been nearly daily, because she loves it so much!). Volume levels are good, sound quality good for her age group. We LOVE that two can listen, and that it has a speaker feature. Fairly tough, though sometimes the on/off button is unresponsive. Would give 4 1/2 * if I could."
4,We love it.,"My son loves this thing. The best part is the built-in speaker and the sound quality is great. Figuring out how to get the songs loaded was a task and the fact that you can't load iTune songs onto them due to the format conflict really sucks, unless you can figure out how to convert m4a's to mp3s. So I gave 4 stars. But the price is reasonable and it's very durable. The ""shaker"" part is kinda cool since you can change songs by holding down the button and giving it a quick shake, or you have the option of turning the base. What we don't like is the fact that you can only skip one song at a time and you can't fast-forward, much like the iPod Shuffle. But even that's not a big deal. Overall we like the product. It comes with a key-chain to dangle on the belt-loop if you choose, and earphones."
4,Perfect for Tweens,My 10-year old daughter got this for Christmas from her uncle and she loves it. I was wanting to buy her an mp3 player but the good ones were so expensive. He discovered this one online and bought one for her and his step-children. She loved the colar and how it was so easy to carry.It is very simple to download the music onto the palyer and it holds tons and tons of songs. My only complaint is that it goes through batteries fast which is way I did not give it five stars.If you are looking for an inexpensive mp3 player for your tween this is the way to go.
4,Love the Sansa Shaker MP 3 Player!,"I love this product. My 10 year old son bought one with his own money about 6 months ago and we were happy with it then. We then decided to get the pink one for my daughters 3rd birthday. She absolutely loves it. It's simple, durable, and my 3 year old uses it by herself w/no problem. I love the external speaker since she's so little the headphones don't fit well. Definitely would recommend this product!"
5,great mp3 for young kids,"Bought the sansa shaker for my 5 year old son for Christmas, his older siblings have ipods and I wanted him to have something to listen to music. This MP3 player is great for young children, easy and fun to use! He loves it."
2,Sansa Shaker MP3 player,"Product is okay. This is the second one as the 1st one broke within a week of purchase. Unable to ""shake"" the player to get it to skip to the next song."
4,Great little music player,"This item was a favorite Christmas present with my kids, 8 year old girls. A bit smaller than I thought it would be, but has surprisingly good sound quality for it's size. My kids love taking it around the house with them and listening to their favorite songs. Easy to use controls that the kids can operate and fun features, like shaking to change songs and cool sound effects. The only problem we had was figuring out which songs (and format, MP3) we could download (itunes wouldn't work for us). Otherwise it was easy to hook it up to the computer for downloading. Overall, we were impressed and would recommend this product."
4,Sansa Shaker,"I bought the 1gb shaker for my son for Christmas. I have given it four stars because for the 3 days it worked it was great. It was very easy to set up and start [once I found the batter compartment...just read the book], but it broke today and I cannot get it to come on. I have been in contact w/Sandisk's customer service and they are replacing the player and even sending me the shipping label. So, due to the customer service I received today, I decided its worth the 4 stars. Hopefully the next one won't break so easily."
2,Good & Bad,This little guy does a decent job for the price. I really like it because of the funky controls. It's formfactor is great for when I'm driving because I can change songs without looking at the device. The bad part is that the MP3 player comes with the bass set too high. I have to turn my bass all the way down so it won't sound awful. When I use headphones it sounds ok.
1,worthless,"the shaker would not read the card. i called sandisk several times to get assistant, and it still did not read the card."
5,Put a smile on grandson face at Christmas,I bought it for my grandson for christmas and he loved it. I would recommed it for children age range 5-9.Sansa Shaker MP3 Player 512MB- BlueNaomi Melton
1,Not worth the $$$,"I would not recommend this product. The iPod shuffle would be a better buy, and definitely better quality. I purchased two shakers as gifts. The bottom cover continuously unlatches on one and the other shaker stopped playing after about 1.5 weeks. I tried troubleshooting by reconnecting to the pc, but it was not recognized. Sandisk said this is a recurring problem and to connect to the USB ports at the back of the pc. Haven't tried that step yet (but sounds like more trouble than it's worth). Besides, I've been successful at connecting iPods and digital cameras just fine to the front USB ports. The battery life is AWFUL! Required a new battery after several hours of on and off play. Even with brand new rechargeable ones! Hope to send this cheaply made product back and get my money back to use towards the shuffle."
1,Does not work well,"Purchased the Sansa Shaker for my son who is 5 yrs old. I downloaded songs for him and it worked for a day and then stopped. I thought it was the battery, but it was not the case(i changed it to different batteries). It turns on, but then it shuts off by itself. I am very disappointed at this product. It did work only for one day. I buy things from Amazon.com all the time, but this product was not good. I am wondering if i can return or something. I would not recommend it. My son is very upset because he liked the product when it last.Kelly"
3,good design but bad memory,"Simple, kid-friendly design, my 3-year-old has figured out how to use it. After just a few days we noticed that one song is messed up (it plays really slowly). It's always the same song and we haven't changed the music on it, so it must be the flash memory. It thought that was SanDisk's strength... Also, when it turns off it makes an annoying sound..."
5,Awesome for Kids! Simple to use!,"My 2 1/2 yr old daughter was jealous of her 6 yr old sisters ""music box""- aka MP3 player. We got her this and she is thrilled and can operate it herself. I like that you dont have to have headphones to hear the songs, there is an speaker on the end and the sound is great. I also like that you load the songs on a SD card, that can be replaced with a larger capacity is desired. Great product, wonderful value!"
4,"easy to use, nice design","i got this for my 5 year old niece and didnt really know if she was gonna like it or use it for more than a few days, but she loves her sansa shaker, its really easy and fun to use, and she loves to listen to music with the speaker on, which i find great cuz headphones can be dangerous at such young age. It comes with some stickers to decorate. I would have liked to have a bigger range of color to decide from thou, but its not a big deal. It sounds fairly good, obviously with such a small speaker you cant expect a lot but for its size, it does the work. Plenty of memory space. It makes a great present. Price/quality is very good, i recommend it."
5,Excellant,"My daughter really likes the Sansa Shaker. It's easy for her to operate and her friends can listen with her. The door on the end does come open easily though, but I would still recoomend it.A Happy Customer!"
2,Not a quality product and bad customer service,"I bought this for my 5 year old son for Xmas. It stopped working after less than an hour. I watched him play with it, and he did nothing to cause it. The battery had a hard time connecting to the player. Well, after 3 different sets of batteries (just to make sure)we contacted Sandisk and their customer service was terrible! Long story short, they admitted I needed a new one after an hour on the phone, but it took 3 weeks to get a new one; explain that to a 5 year old.I gave this 2 stars because it is the only one I could find with external speakers, which I prefer so he doesn't need earphones. The new one has been working, but we had problems turning it off once, and the only way we were able to turn it off was to take out the battery. THis seems to be a flaw in this model."
5,Sansa Shaker Review,"I was doubtful about this because it was so cheap - and my 8 yr old daughter already has a 2 gig mp3 player. However, the fact that it has a built in speaker has made it her first choice - as well as that of my 5 yr old son - I got them each one.The device works well, is easy to synch, and has had no problems so far. I gave it five stars, because for the target audience - it is truly perfect. Very easy to use, and has a built in speaker. The kids don't care that it sounds worse than the AM radio in my 1972 Chevy Nova - they love it.Highly recommended for kids needing something simple to use."
1,dont work any more,One headphone quit working 3 days after christmas and now the player wont do anything but make funny noises-doesnt play any music any more
4,"Good value, good player","Overall, I'm happy with this MP3 player. The only issues we have had are that yes, the headphones are too big for my daughter's ears (but this isn't that big of a deal, as she rarely uses headphones anyway), and the MP3 format problem. I was about to be upset about this...I didn't realize just how many of our songs were in WMA format. But I found a free program online that you can download that converts files. It's quick and easy to use. It's called Switch Sound File Converter. Since I figured that out, no problems. Is it a pain in the butt? Yes. But this thing was cheap, and I'm not paying big bucks for a more streamlined MP3 player that might end up getting broken or lost. Overall, worth the money."
2,"Didn't last long, only plays mp3s, could be more user friendly","Got this for my daughters 7th birthday. It was pretty fun, but several negatives.--Lasted under two weeks, no damage. turns on but will not play--Only plays music in MP3 format. this was a problem for me because I have some of my music and Free Audio books from the library are in WMA format.-- You have to hold the play button while you shake it to change songs. Sometimes this doesnt work out and just puts the music on pause.Dont let this scare you away from SanDisk players however, I have a Sansa Clip that I love (better than my Ipod)!"
5,The sandisk shaker is a winner with my grand daughter,"I looked long and hard to find an mp3 player that could be easily loaded and operated by y 6 year old grand daughter. The shaker was just the thing. It's single buttln operation is easy to use and it loads by just copying mp3 files onto it's mempory card. After spending 2 hours trying to get another brand to work, I finally took it back and found the shaper. It's great for smaller children and even for adults. It was also the most reasonable priced one I could find available."
4,Sansa Shaker - Our Little Guy's First MP3 Player,"The Sansa Shaker is exactly what I expected. It's an easy-to-use MP3 player that's main feature was the built-in speaker.We gave this to our 2 1/2 year old without the headphones and he loves it.The shaking feature is a little hard for him to get (you have to hold the play/pause button while shaking it), but he seems content to just listen to the music in order without changing the tracks.The product seems sturdy, but we'll see how long it lasts in the clutches of a little one!"
4,Great for a little girl,Santa gave this to my daughter easy to use all her fav songs to go and due to her ear surgery i don't have to worry about her putting things in her ears
1,not so hot,got this for my 4 year old and my 8 year old... my 4 year old loved his but they just kept not working he took very good care of them but still just kept breaking and my 8 year old thought they were to baby looking.. got 3 different ones for my youngest and still don't have one that works then some family bought their kids some and again still don't have one that works out of all of us so no way would i buy this again
4,Loves her Shaker,"I did some research on this product before I bought it and found some of the reviews to be negative. However I personally have not had a problem with it so far. I bought it for my 7yr old daughters birthday and she absolutely loves it. I thought there was a problem with the cap that protects the memory card and battery because it kept falling off as the reviews said, however once I was shown how to operate the Sansa Shaker properly it is not a problem any longer, when changing the songs if you make sure that they only turn the directional band and not grab the entire bottom it won't fall off; you also have to make sure that the cap clicks when putting back on that is the lock position. As far as the battery life I find that the rechargeable batteries hold longer even when she is listening to the music through the speaker. So I would recommend it for other children. Thumbs up SanDisk.SanDisk Sansa Shaker 512 MB MP3 Player (Pink)"
4,Sandisk Sansa Shaker (Pink),"This is a great product. The kids LOVE it. They can plug in 2 sets of headphones at the same time to ""share"" the music. It also has an external speaker that plays the music for all to hear when the headphones are not plugged into it. The only real down fall is that it does not recharge via USB port like our other MP3 players do, it takes 1 AAA battery, this is the only reason I didn't give this product a 5 Star rating. As I said the kids love it,so it is used a lot which means changing the battery every 4 days or so. We have found a solution, we bought a rechargable battery set so there's always a new battery charged and waiting without having to buy stock in a battery company. All in all this is a fabulous player for kids. It is sturdy, easy to use, easy to upload to, comes with some kid songs on it, fun to shake and play. My girls are 5 & 7. Hope this helps."
3,Caution - Doesn't play WMA Format!,"Since this is only an MP3 Player and not a WMA player a lot of the current music like Naked Brothers Band, and Jonas Brothers, etc are not available for this player. More and more MP3 is becoming available just not the current stuff your tweens want.. Mine are 6 and 7 and they wanted to the hear naked brothers band song ""Crazy Cars"" and of course it's not available. Live and Learn Hope that helps."
4,Great gift!,My six year old daughter got this for christmas and she loves having an mp3 like her big brothers! It was very easy to load songs and the sound is pretty good too. Only con is that it goes through AAA batteries pretty quickly...but the price was right for a younger kid's mp3 player!
3,"Nice item, but only plays mp3 - real weakness","Hi, my 2 boys, 1 is 7 and the other 5 really like this item. It enven came with preloaded childs song. But, when I try to find any current music to purchase online that they would like (jonas brothers, naked brothers, etc.) it's all in wma format which the sansa doesn't play. So if your thinking of getting a player for your kids find one that plays wma format and not just mp3. Live and learn. I even tried a program called switch to switch some wma to mp3 but all the current tunes have DRM which prevents the conversion. THis is all a very sad situation. I want to buy more music, but the companies are actually preventing me from doing so.Good Luck and hope this helps."
5,My identical twin nephews love them,"I bought these for my nephews, identical twins, who turned 7 on October 9th and are in 2nd grade. Their dad had a bit of trouble at first (he is an I-Pod owner), but called the 800 number, where he, in just a few seconds, learned how easy they were to use. Since then, not only did he download music onto the shakers, he has downloaded some of their favorite CD's (I did not even know that you could do this) to the shakers. My sis-in-law, said that these are their favorite ""toys"" and do not go anywhere without them. They think that Aunt Anna-Marie is the best...I highly recommend them!!!!!!"
4,kid friendly,"We bought this MP3 player for my 4yr old son- It seemed like the most kid friendly option. The player is easy to use but fairly sensitive- needs to be just so for the shake to be effective. Even so, my son has mastered it! The most annoying bit for me is the tendency for the player to ""freeze"". This is where it is stuck on a song and I can not fast forward, reverse or shut the player off. I simply remove the battery and all seems to return to normal. This is definitely one of his favorite toys- and my CD's are no longer getting scratched!!!"
4,Very good,"My sister bought this (in blue) for my 7 year old for Christmas and he loves it! I think that the size and ease of use is fine. We discovered that iTunes is not compatable so we had to transfer a lot of songs to mp3 format but not a big deal if you know how to do it. Even if you aren't a techie most newer windows media players will walk you through the process of changing the format to mp3s. Which is what I did.The only design flaw that we found is at the bottom of the player. It twists off to replace the battery and the SD card, and is attached by a string, but it pops open often when changing tracks by the bottom ""ring"" or when using the ""shake"" feature. It doesn't get lost because of the string, but it slightly annoying to have to keep putting it back on.Otherwise, this is a great little player! Highly recommended for the price! My son feels very grown up now that he has his own mp3 player!Mom in the 'burgh"
5,Big Bad Sound,"This album is pretty uncharacteristic for my usual tastes, but I really dig the big sound it gives, with big beat and big bass. My favorite track is Bass Synethesir which is a pretty characteristic early 80's techno'y song that brings me back to the days of low-riders and Lakers games. A good addition to any electronica collection and certianly ecletic."
4,A Real Page Turner!,"I loved this book and thought it very entertaining. Not only is this a captivating ghost story - it contains mystery, unrequited love, and compassion between friends. I loved Ms. Denison's use of history in telling Stella's story. I couldn't wait to turn the page to find out what would happen next. If you like a good read - I highly recommend this book to you."
3,St. Francis,I purchased for my nephew making his confirmation. It Provided a good history of the man he chose to be his name
3,Bones for Construction,"This textbook is actually a collection of articles that present the pro and con arguments on what the author considers to be the most cogent controversial issues in psychology today. In addition to the articles, there are web site suggestions, and challenge questions at the end of each pair of articles that take the reader beyond a simple 'I agree' or 'I disagree' response.For instructors attempting to bring critical thinking, analysis, open dialogue, and multiple relativistic thinking into a college classroom, it's a very good tool. The supplemental booklets would be extremely useful for teachers embarking on this course, and would need to be obtained from the publisher.As a stand alone book, the general reader might find it lacking in organization and content.The 11th edition contains mainly the same articles from the 10th."
5,great movie,"great movie, good history and oh how I can relate to this flick. movie came in an amazing amount of time"
2,When Do We Eat,"When I saw this DVD online I purchased it thinking that it sounded like a great plot line, had wonderful actors, and that it should be great entertainment. It is not. The movie itself is painfully slow and equally painful to watch. The plot line sounds good, but it never develops into an entertaining action line. Additionally, the technical quality is poor and the format is an incredibly annoying small, narrow screen. There are a few moments here and there (which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to 1), but nothing compelling enough to make it worth your money or your time. You'll regret it if you purchase this one. Pass it by."
2,Not family viewing,"This film has content that makes it suitable only for those aged over 16 or so. It is not what I would call a ""family movie""."
1,"Free shipping, but no product to ship","The ad said free shipping, so I ordered 5 of the same DVDs. I got the bill, which included shipping and wrote back that the site said shipping was free. This was about one week after I submitted the order. They said ok, that shipping would be free. About 5 days later , the company wrote and said the entire order was back ordered and thay didn't know when I would get it. In the meantime, they charged my credit card, which I received yesterday and the company had charged my card. Now I need to call my credit card company to reverse the charges.I have had no problems ordering from Amazon, and nothing but problems when I ofder from a different vendor off of the Amazon site.I will never do it again.Darryl Forman"
1,A New Low,Amazing that an outstanding artist can sound so awful. I'm sorry that there isn't a picture of the album cover shown here so I didn't know to read the other review. Save your money and make another choice
3,Marvin has been better.,"Well, I own the Every Great Motown Hit record, and I own this one, and I must say, the songs on this album do not even compete with the ones on teh Every Great Motown Hit one. He still manages to blend and vary his music and this album and that makes it enjoyable. He would be excellent to see in concert!"
5,great deal!,"i was afraid to by it by internet, but I got it on the same conditions than the one that you get at stores."
3,its ok guitar,looks great love the look. sounds all right just cannot hear the gibson lespaul tone i worked almost 2 hr just trying to get the gibson feel was not very happy. accent on the strings sucks and it dosnt hold tuning. i strongly suggest lespaul standard. much love
1,Just like being in the Army again....,"its not often that a film accurately captures the true feelings and emotions of military life. Where films like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket truly convey the horrors of war, DFIII reminds me of how mind numbinly boring being in the Army could be. It succeds on this level. Fire watch,ammo detail and KP were more exciting than this dreck. Avoid at all costs unless you are an insomniac."
1,Fragile,"When I got the toy, the first time I used it the spring came out and could not be replaced. I contacted the company and they said they would send another, which they did. That one was broken also, the pull back was off kilter or bent and it would not send the marbles all the way through to the buckets. I contacted the company and said I wanted my money back, they said they would issue a refund but have not done so as of yet. It's been several weeks."
1,A strain on the mind.,"The more I read Dr. Khalifa's argument against the hadith, the less I understand what exactly it is that he is attempting to get across. There is absolutely no historical analysis of the compilation of the hadith. Dr. Khalifa simply discredits the hadith through his own interpretations of the Qur'an - apart from this, he has no solid argument."
1,A book full of non-sequiturs and false premises.,"Rashad Khalifa is obviously deluded. If you read his composition, he has deceived himself into thinking he is a Messenger of God. From an Islamic viewpoint, he is a liar. Unfortunately, this mental illness and the peddling of a mathematical miracle which supports (?) evidence against the hadith is a non-sequitur. There is no logical connection. One of Dr. Khalifa's favorite methods of argumentation is to yank verses out of context from the Qur'an to prove his point. His argument can be shred by the most feeble rebuttals. Conclusion? From what I read, either Dr. Khalifa is mentally ill, or a servant of Satan."
1,this is pure heresy,"EVEN IF you reject hadith (which is an extremely silly notion to begin with) you must still accept Muhammad(peace be upon him) was the FINAL prophet -- its IN THE QURAN.this man is a crazy fool, and only someone dumber than a box of hair can think he brings the ""divine truth""i seek refuge in Allah from this heretical nonsense, and may Allah guide the people of this ideology back to the straight path.if you are a non muslim, DO NOT read anything by this man. instead, i recommend you go buy the noble quran by khan and hilaleealso, for those muslims who follow this khalifa man, go read authority and importance of the sunnah by jamal zarabozo (also available on amazon.com) he details over FORTY quranic ayat disproving this deviant ideology."
1,A Book Produced by Mental Arberrated Person,First of all Rashad Khalifa never produced any solid proofs for his notions and he never forthwith any historical facts. He MISTRANSLATED most of the Qur'anic Verse to vindicate his claim and SUBSTITUTE with the Original Quran with his own satanic-version translation of quran...as a matter of fact..he never used origianl quranic verse in all his claims thus it falls flat!...I wish i could give negative 1000 for the star
3,WHERE'S THE GROWTH?,"i was expecting something above and beyond the original bass extremes from 1994, but i didn't get that, this album seemed rushed, and uninspired compared to the bass extremes of 1994. but never-the-less, a good disc.. but get the 1st one before this."
5,Wooton and Baily deliver one hell of a record,"These two greats have created a jazz classic for everyone to enjoy, you don't have to be a bassist to appreciate it. The mellow tones and flowing rhythm make this a perfect album to drive to. Reminiscent of Wooton's early stuff with Bela Fleck."
2,A COOL CAT LOOKING FOR COOL BASS,HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED ! Cosidering that this CD was registered under BAILEY I thought for sure there would be more of him on the cd. There is no comparison between this and what Victor puts out solo. The strongest part to this album was Gregg Bissonette (the drumer) For all of you BASS Hounds out there save your money and buy something Vic put out solo !
3,Pretty Cool,"I must say that Steve and Victor are the best. This CD is cool, but not one that I can listen to a lot. It has a lot of nasty playing and creative ideas and I dig it, maybe because I am a bass player. If you play bass, you would appretiate this. 3 stars is not an insult, it is a solid CD not at all bad, but not increadible."
4,"Consistently good, but timid","If you've never heard Victor Wooten's work, this CD is outstanding. If you've listened to Vital Tech Tones (with Scott Henderson and Steve Smith), The Flecktones Live Art or Left of Cool, or Victor's own 3 solo disks, this CD is still great, but doesn't break new ground. Maybe too much reverence for each other, and not enough getting down and dirty. Oteill Burbridge's work adds greatly. Wish he would spend more time with Victor, and put out his second solo album soon."
3,"pleasant, innocuous, easy to read-","so why didn't I like it more? Usually, when I read a book about Torah, there are a few points that make me think ""Wow!"" - the sort of points I would mention in a review like this one. I had no ""Wow"" moments reading this book. Nevertheless, I think Meier's book would probably be a pretty good book for a teenager or someone unfamiliar with other commentaries."
4,Talky introspective little indie,"Five people come together at a Maine vacation cottage for a short getaway and complications ensue. The married couple is on the verge of a breakup because they were never right for each other and the man has met someone new. Meanwhile, another couple of seemingly happy yuppies are really not so happy after all, and they break up right in the middle of things, with the guy sent home. That leaves the fifth wheel, who is the brother of the married guy. Their relationship is close but troubled. There's no action in this movie, only very long scenes of self-absorbed dialogue. It's a relationship piece. Some of the scenes are set at night, and they are extremely dark, probably because the budget was so low they could not afford decent set lighting. This is a pleasant little diversion, but not for action junkies."
5,Bibleman rocks!,"Move over Batman, Spiderman, Wonder Woman and the rest of your buddies. All of the Bibleman movies rock. They are great for boys AND girls who want a superhero they CAN emulate. (Since Bibleman has a few ""helpers"" and 1 or 2 are females) Bibleman is just a regular guy who fights evil with the Word of God - just like everyone should who follows Jesus Christ. They are a little ""goofy"" & spoof other shows which make it fun for the children yet they teach a great message! These have helped my child learn scripture verses easily through the ""fun factor"". And not only do they have movies but toys to play with and costumes to dress up in to playout the movies. Great alternative to regular superhero's."
5,Amazing Details! Great for History Buffs,"I didn't purchase this book for a child--I bought it for myself. It's amazingly detailed, with period touches that are both historically accurate and amazingly realistic. I used it for inspiration for a book I was writing, set in the Victorian period. I don't know how well it will hold up under the hands of a child, but I've got mine on display on my desk bookshelf, as a quick resource. It's amazing to me the feeling it creates of actually being in a Victorian period house."
5,Best book in the world,"I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter,but couldn't resist a peek, its great!"
3,Nice but missing family,Victorian doll house is in great shape but was missing family that comes with it as it does new.It's understandable that the Victorian paperdoll family wouldn't be included but that should be mentioned.
3,Some details...,"It may be worth pointing out, for the true fans, that this car has no push bar, incorrect wheels (at least they're close), lacks much of the chrome trim by the rear window, and MOST ANNOYINGLY (to me), the ""General Lee"" decals are too large and are as long as the flag, just like all the models for sale. You would think someone would at least be able to make a decal the right size. If you don't mind all those things, then this is a pretty nice package for a decent price."
3,Okay toaster,"It does its job I guess.Pro(s):- Nice looking and cute- Good sizeCon:- The ""defrost"" and ""bagel"" buttons don't quit work. They don't light up after you press them."
2,Doesn't brown enough,"Even on the highest setting, this toaster doesn't brown english muffins -- I have to go back and push it in again. Since a good toast is what a toaster should minimally do, I would not recommend this toaster. The push down handle also seems very flimsy."
3,OK,"It was an okay toaster. The handle would not stay pushed down and had to be thrown away after a little over 2 1/2 years of fairly regular use. It did a pretty good job on bagels, but could not handle really thin bread or pop tarts without them falling inside and burning, so I would not consider it a thin slice toaster at all. Anything other than a bagel never seemed to brown evenly."
4,yummy lipglosses!,"Ive always been a fan of the sugar brand lipglosses and thought I would buy this cute set to sample some other colors. Most of the colors are great in here and they all have that yummy sugary vainlla smell to them, the only bad thing about these is that they dont tell you the name of the lipgloss on the tube. Seeing as how these are really tiny glosses and are basically just samples its probably not even worth it for the company to print it on there, but it would have been nice to know in case i wanted to order the color online or something. overall a great stocking stuffer or sampler for yourself!"
1,"only beats, almost no vocals",this album has many songs with almost no vocals....only beats are included and spoken words....that's too boring for me
3,So so,"Introduction to Philosophy is a very compact book. The author basically attempts to give a very brief overview of every possible area of philosophy being studied today. The authors' opinion however really gets in the way of any kind of objective treatment of the topics. He is very opinionated about which arguments are to be taken seriously and which arguments are to be rejected outright. If you want to just get a general idea about a specific topic in philosophy you might be better off just googling it than buying this book. One of the reasons I say that is because the book covers soooo many individual topics, so briefly, it's really difficult to come away with really any understanding of any one topic. Overall this book didn't go over so well with me and I stopped about half way through. A book I much preffered to this one was Philosophy Made Simple, which I recommend if you are just trying to get started in philosophy and looking for a good overview."
4,Philosophy in a nut shell,"William James Earle's Introduction to Philosophy is a basic introductory text given to the problems, terminology, and methodology of philosophy, from a philosophical perspective. The book is broken up into the typical fields, and then each chapter ends, which I found strange. Nonetheless, I highly recommend the book, as it strips the subject down to reveal its red, pristine back-side, never succumbing to the sort of sensational camp that is typical of your basic introductory text. He perfectly sets the tone with the opening sentence: ""Philosophy is not what is, but what cannot be that is, and the summation of all that can never not be."" Powerful."
4,An easy book about philosophy.,"I took professor Earle's introduction to philosophy class some years ago when I was an undergraduate at Baruch College and was assigned this book. The book presents basic philosophical topics in an easy form. We only read about 30 pages with the professor explaining important concepts in class. There were two relatively easy midterms. Prior to the midterms one could go to his office with questions. If one wants introduction to philosophy, this book is the place to begin. By the way, professor Earle is one of the best professors you would ever meet. He is funny and appears to care about his students. He teaches at Baruch College in downtown Manhattan. A great guy!"
3,review,larger than i thought. bought a smaller version of this book. helpful in food service and helped out in my dietetic internship
3,Culinary Math,"I think that this book definitely has some good knowledge for Culinary Math. It is quite cumbersome, though, because it gives you too many practice problems. If they cut down on the practice problems, I think this book would be better."
5,Love That TLC Volume 1 Cookbook,Karen Rysavy has written a wonderfully creative lowcarb cookbook! All her recipes are so easy to follow! They're not the kind of recipes that you find everywhere! Talk about taste! Karen doesn't skip on taste at all! I recommend this book to everyone interested in a lowcarb way of eating!
5,Truly limitless cooking,"I must have over a dozen low-carb cookbooks, and this is still my favorite. The recipes are imaginative and don't rely on commercially prepared seasonings and sauces,(she teaches you how to make your own, and usually with a lower carb content!). The carb counts are low and the techniques are easy. I question the $69.99 price tag listed, however. Is this an error? I did not (and would not) pay this much for it when ordering it direct from Karen (trulylowcarb.com)."
2,Nothing special,"There are lots of other LC books out there with more imaginative (and tastier) recipes. I was disappointed in many of the recipes and found myself throwing away some of them, specifically the Mockaroni and Cheese. (and I HATE to waste food.)But, there are some good ideas in there. If you're a collector of LC cookbooks, might be good to have it. (Every book has SOMETHING to offer.) But, if you're picking and choosing ... I'd look somewhere else.I'd be afraid to recommend this book to beginners though, because they could get discouraged from the low carb eating, and that's a shame, as I feel it's a great healthy ""diet"". I've lost 50 lbs and never felt hungry. And with interesting recipes, I never felt deprived."
2,Not worth the price,"First book I've ever returned to [...]. Similiar to cookbooks that school fundraisers put together, but at [...] price tag there are better options out there. I've bought lots of cookbooks, usually only make a handful of recipes from them but love to look. This one was visually boring and the recipes required ingredients that were not always easy to find in my Midwest town. A disappointment."
2,Slightly disappointed,"My first impression of ""Cooking TLC"" was ""It looks good but I don't know if it was worth [the price]. I did keep the book but have not made a single recipe in the two months that I have had it. I have looked through it many times. There are no health food stores in our area and there are many products that I can not find. Between not wanting to make a recipe just for one person (my husband will not eat this kind of food)and not wanting to mail order hard to find ingredients, this book has not been very helpful to me."
5,"Great Movie, I loved it.",I saw this movie on Netflix and thought it was outstanding. My son purchased it for me for Xmas.I recommend it for people who like real life stories.
2,Don't bother if you already use yoga and other natural headache management techniques,"This book reads like a doctor's office pamphlet or an introductory primer. It's fully 12% in (on a Kindle) before they finally get past the sales pitch that you read in the sample, and longer than that before they get to the point. It seems to have been written for people who have no prior knowledge of natural medicine and yoga. If you are already familiar with yoga, mudras, natural foods, etc. as headache management, this is probably not the book for you and will likely be a big disappointment. On the other hand, if that's what you are looking for and this is your first exposure to the subject (and you like it), then I can't recommend enough that you do more research and learn about hand mudras and natural foods, different types of yoga, etc. I think they should have added ""An Introduction to"" prior to the rest of the title. That would help set the expectation to the right level."
3,Pleasant,"I was a little disappointed in this movie. I expected more humor from the characters, given the actors. I'm glad it wasn't silly, but I wish I had been able to laugh more. It was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy day I guess."
2,Too structured for a 13 month old,"The ""music"" setting does not allow my toddler to play the piano freestyle; instead, it constantly tries to get her to play the songs it chooses by giving instructions to follow the lights. I can't figure out any way to turn off the directed play and have it be free play.The Pooh characters on top are cute, but the piano tells the child which one to pick up and tells them they got it wrong if they pick up one other than the one that was instructed.When the child is done playing with it, it keeps talking to the child for several minutes before shutting itself off.It does not have a low volume setting and is quite loud.I had very high hopes for this toy, as my daughter loves other music toys, and I love Pooh, but I have been disappointed. This toy just sits on the shelf."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed... When I bought this I was excited about the piano feature, but was disappointed to find that it only plays the preprogramed music. It also keeps prompting the baby to follow the preprogramed lights (VERY IRRITATING) over and over. No young baby could, or would want to follow it. Would be much more fun if the baby could just bang on it and make music, and then have the characters respond."
4,THE RAZOR'S EDGE,HAVE WANTED TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS FOR YEARS. CAPTURES A TIME IN HISTORY PERFECTLY AND THE JADED PEOPLE LIVING IN THE TWENTIES.
5,Maugham's finest.,"Set between the two world wars, The Razor's Edge is a shrewd novel of idealism. Supported by several finely drawn sub-plots is a circuitous study of a mans efforts to realize in himself the divine nature latent in each of us. This ambitious book is an enjoyable and edifying success."
5,The Razors Edge,"Your personal library wouldn't be complete without a copy of The Razors Edge. So well written it's difficult to put down. The characters are described so well, it's as if you've known them your whole life. The scenery of Paris, the descriptions of their personalities are vividly brought to your imagination. With eloquence and sophistication, the author brings the pages to life. And, the movie isn't bad either..."
4,"great book, but..........",Let me start by saying that this book is indeed great. The style of writing by Maugham is incredible. The book is basically the life of Larry as described through the eyes of the author. Larry searches for the meaning of life and supposedly finds it in an Ashram from South India.The whole discussion between Maugham and Larry towards the end of the book is fascinating. Since I am from South India I exactly understand what they were saying. The only problem I had with the book was the abrupt transformation that Larry goes through on the top of the mountain. This leaves a taste of an unfinished work and the satisfaction of an answer is never gained at the end. On the whole an excellent read.....
5,one of my favourite books,"Somerset Maugham is one of my favourite writers, there is no other writer who can make laugh out loud as oftem as Maugham. He has a way of presenting human beings as foolish, ridiculous and enslaved by there own vanity, yet always seems to possess the self awareness to see himself in the same terms.This is an excellent book to read if your at a bit of a crossroads in your life and considering going away to ""find yourself"". I would also recomend ""of Human Bondage"" if you have fell in love with the wrong girl. ""The moon and sixpence"" if you wish you could be an artist. One of his most underated books ""catalina"" is one of my favourites as well"
3,Workmanlike--in a bad way,"Never mind the transparency of this novel'scharacterizations, has anyone else noticed thatMaugham couldn't write an original metaphorto spare his life? The man lacked all powersof poetic description. While as narrator he lavishes praise on the character of Larry Darrell,he can no more describe Larry's voice thanto say it was ""rich"" and had a ""warmth."" Larry'sever-present smile is described--repeatedly--as ""sweet."" How pedestrian!"
5,Moving suggestive portrait of what it means to yearn to know,"It has been said that a young man should not read Somerset Maugham too early in life, lest he be ruined, and The Razor's Edge is a tremendous example of the truth behind that aphorism.The search for understanding is one we all yearn to undertake, but Larry Darrell serves as an example that what we want in life we may not necessarily get. It's a hard lesson we think we understand, but it is not until the vast torrent of life washes the lesson over us that we truly realize just how insignificant we are.Although the narrative device of author/uncle does weaken this book, it would be hard to imagine it written with such power in any other way.A must read for anyone who longs to understand our place in existence."
4,timeless,"This is a facinating story of a man who turns his back on the ambitions of his fellow Americans to follow his own path. This novel works on many levels: it is a love story and one of revenge, of spiritual journey and social snobbery, selfishness and love of fellow man. The author tells the story as a character in the novel. His language is rich yet strangely free of phrases and cliches that would detract from his story; in this way it transcends the setting. The lives of its main characters unfold gradually; we hear only the essential elements that move the story along. It is intriguing to see how the characters evolve as the novel progresses. First rate!! It certainly causes you to question what is essential in life."
4,Understand its popularity,"I had not seen the 1940's movie version of this story until recently on TCM, which prompted me to purchase the book on Kindle and read it. The written story is intriguing and was certainly helped by some of the character portrayals from the movie version. Hollywood put the story in a chronological order, unlike Maugham did in the book. Some of the pivotal activity of the book, i.e, situations to help understand the plot better, are reserved for the end, kind of putting it all together and into perspective. The movie ruins some of the intrigue by placing things in time-line order. Also, because it doesn't require the physical limitations of actors, the book allows for greater character development, especially with Isabel, Gray and Sophie.The story is one of self-discovery and I could see several people from my own life in the role of Laurence Darrell. I would have liked to have read the book first and then watched the movie, but it was still good the way I did it."
5,"This is the fourth book I have purchased from Amazon since I received my Kindle, and the BEST..","My husband recently watched the movie on TCM and raved about the story. Read some of the reviews ofthe book on Amazon, and was encouraged by the reviews to read the book. Bought it for my Kindle. Wonderful, absorbing story.Larry, the hero of the book, was such an admirable character-so kind and caring for all. However, Isabel, who adored him, was a pitiful excuse for a human being, too concerned about how she was perceived by others. Finally, at the end of the book, he came to realize that he and Isabel were totally unsuitedfor one another.The book made me want to read more of Maugham's fiction."
5,excellent study of human nature and choices,"At first I thought this book was not going to be as great as Of Human Bondage which I love, but as I read on, the significance of the message and the poignancy of this book became so pronounced. In fact, it is amazing how the author managed to convey such heavy issues in this short book, and to incorporate literary weight as well as underlying dark humor. He is a master researcher and observer of personalities, better than some psychologists, as well as a great communicator of philosophy--what do we pursue, what prices we pay, what do we worship, and how do we justify our choices? The last page of this book sums it up so deliciously!"
4,thought provoking,"After a short term of adjustment to the prose form and dated situation, the plot and characters were compelling. As the story unfolded I continually reflected on how my behavior would have either mirrored or differed from those being portrayed. Absorbing."
5,The Razor's Edge,Somerset Maugham is an amazing writer. He style is clear and straightforward but packed with thoughtful meaning and introspection. The Razor's Edge is the story of life's journey that resonates with anyone who questions the materialistic values of the modern day. It is timeless. One of my all time favorites.
4,Nice book!,"nice book,Easy to understand even for non-native speaker. Story is easy to follow and interesting.Very light reading and question the human existence."
1,Point of View,"The most important aspect of fiction is the choice of a narrator. Why Maugham chose a first-person narrator is beyond me.The narrator's periodic apologies for having to use his imagination for details he couldn't possibly know, including the thoughts and feelings of other characters, become tiresome very quickly as simply a ploy that goes nowhere. Maugham may not have understood the importance of point of view or I may not yet understand why he used first-person. Narrative intrusion is the greatest sin in fiction.If the former is the case, it's a great shame. It could have been a lasting work of art, if so, art being that in which every detail has a raison d'tre, most especially the choice of the best narrator to tell the story."
2,There are better ways...,"There are far better ways to acquire what this book has to offer. As other reviewers have stated, it is about a handful of people and the way they live their lives, particularly one young man who strays from the beaten path in search of Truth. The occassional snippets of philosophy and theology are smothered between long descriptive passages of rather uninsightful people-watching. If you have a lot of time on your hands, perhaps this book would appeal to you. If you are looking for an interesting or enlightening read, look elsewhere."
1,the razor's edge,"You may be surprised at this, but I actually threw out this thINKing Classics' edition of the Razor's Edge! WHY?....Because the cover was horrendous! It really bothered me...so cheap and awful for such a great classic novel. Who decides on these sort of cover designs? HORRENDOUS and CHEAP!After throwing this book in the garbage I went to Amazon.co.uk and purchased the Vintage paperback edition of The Razor's Edge. Beautifully produced and in keeping with Somerset Maugham's great writing. There are a number of classics available in Vintage paperback editions."
2,Ugh way too detailed,"Half way through the book and I still dont know the plot. Too much boring detail about how people dress, where they are going to go,,,,ugh."
2,"Other than the introduction, body and conclusion it was good","This book had the potential to be great. He could have made it dramatic, he could have made it beautiful and he could have made it wonderfully artistic. However, he chose none of these and instead went with making it boring and pointless. If you are thinking of reading this book, I guess go ahead... but I hope this serves as a warning to you that it will not be the most exciting or inspiring thing you have ever read."
5,A Writer's Writer,"For technique alone, there are few writers on the same level of W. Somerset Maugham. He may be the best writer of dialogue of the last one hundred years.""The Razor's Edge"" is timeless. It could have taken place during the Vietnam War or the Napoleonic Wars. All of Maugham's books have the underlying theme that you must go through your ration of pain and lonliness in life and if you hang in there you will come out okay in the end. Although I actually like ""Cakes and Ale"" slightly better than this book, this one clearly had the bigger impact and better expressed these recurring themes particularily in the relationship between Larry and Sophie."
5,Timeless Classic,"Timeless classic for anyone who loves freedom, rebirth and the hunger for knowledge. The passages and conversations on India, Paris and the South of France are exquisite, the characters formed; you know some of these people. Many people search the world for truth as self defined, seeking wisdom with passion inside that is an unquenchable fire. This book will mean different things to different people but if you give it a clear read, it will leave a lasting impression on you similar to the novels Lost Horizon and Homage to Catalonia. For anyone with a love of Europe, Americans in Europe and the radiance, tragedy and survival of the human spirit."
5,Enlightment journey very current today,The book and audio detail exquisite conversations and journeys apropos of what many are currently going through now. Lovely vignettes and snapshots of a bygone era-however it seems the issues of enlightment and self examination are universal. Wonderfully written and always refreshing to reread. I love Maughn-he captures so much in each scene.
3,Disappointing overall.....,"After being stunned by the force of his Of Human Bondage, this felt strangely pedestrian and dispassionate. Those looking for enlightenment or spiritual discovery will be disappointed. The passion of Maugham as a young author has indeed been replaced by a workman-like effort."
4,Amazon product,"Guys....the only bad experience i have had so far with buying stuff through amazon.The book I received was through Amazon and was described as ""new"" but it was actually soiled on the outside. Otherwise the book was fine.About the book its a splendid book with the exotic prose of the classics of yore like that of ""Great Expectations"".I am still half way through the book and am reading in the speed read mode.Happy reading guys.this is a book worth the money.CJ in LA"
5,A Excellent Read,"Kemp is in his usual form. Dawn of Night picks up events right after Twilight Falling and continues at a pounding pace. The Plane of Shadows and Skullport are so well-described I could almost taste the foul air.The book opens with a very interesting scene involving the Sojourner, the slaads' master hinted at in Twilight Falling. He is powerful! The book then moves to Cale and his group. Cale must deal with a life-changing transformation, and Riven also seems to be undergoing something. Magadon's past is explained and I found him a very intriguing character.The action is, as usual, well described but not gratuitous. Kemp's pacing is excellent and the end of the book leaves me pining for book III."
5,amazing,I was turned to these book after I didnt hear from a close friend for almost a month. Seems he was shacked up with the Cale books and wouldnt leave his house. I was soon to follow in his steps. This book begins to take you down a road to places you couldnt imagine. Paul Kemp is without a doubt one of my new favorite writers. His dark characters and amazingly played out fights and plot will stay in your mind for quite some time. trust me. you will enjoy the books all the way to the end.
5,Gritty continuation of the adventures of Erevis Cale,"Dawn of Night is a worthy sequel to the epic adventures of Erevis Cale started in Twilight Falling.DoN picks up where Twilight ended and takes us on a journey through several different settings, each interesting and thought provoking in its own way. DoN gives us a feel for the Antagonist of the trilogy and lets us into other preparations being made to further his overall objective. The Pace is quick, and the detailed fight scenes are very well done. As always, Mr. Kemp does a very good job of giving a feel for the setting and mood in order to add to the story line. The characters are well defined and each is interesting separately. The protagonists are evolving as the trilogy continues, which gives them a 'real person' feel.This book delves into the grittier side of the story, in a way not seen often in this genera. The surprising ending makes one wait for the final book in the trilogy with eager anticipation."
3,"Ahh, I'll read the next one.",Just OK. Seems a little hard to follow at times. The story moves a little slow. You could cut out a hunk of this book and not miss it. The first was much better. Hoping the third book brings it home.
5,Deeper into darkness...,"This story delves into dark places with even darker characters. A new villain is revealed with startling power and an intriguing personal philosophy, and readers get to enjoy a healthy dose of characters and action very much in line with the previous book Twilight Falling. If books were drugs, Dawn of Night would be the latest fix that keeps you hooked for more. As a reader, the ending had me so engrossed that I found it extremely difficult to stop, especially when I had the next book readily available. Because of this I have to give it five out of five stars. Not only was it a fun book to read, but it has completely sold me on the entire series and the characters involved. There is no longer any choice for me but to continue reading and that's always the sign of a great saga."
4,"Works great, picture misleading","The disk does exactly what it's adevertised to do - reflect light. One side is silver colored, the other gold colored. Use it regularly.However, the product images makes you think you will get multiple disks in different sizes. That's not the case, it's just a single large disk.It comes in a small pouch, into which it is folded up, and can be folded up into after use. That makes it easy to carry around, and protects it. Takes a few seconds to figure out how to twist and turn the disk so that it folds up.Also, because of all the folding the disk material has wrinkles in it. It doesn't really interfere with it's function when used at proper distance for disk that size.I would buy it again as it fulfills it's purpose, but you have to know what you're getting. Hence only 4 stars."
2,Disappointed,"Its a great idea but renders poor results. I found it easy to hook up and configure with my Mac but the recordings are terrible. Picks up any surrounding noise, even with gain turned completely down. Don't think you are going to sing along with your favorite LP's as they converted into MP3's. Unless you are looking to add your voice to the recording this is not your solution."
2,confusing,"Hello, this seemed like a good idea, but we've spent so much time fiddling with the thing trying to get the program right in the computer for it actually to record. I'm sure it works, but it's been so much hastle trying to do so that I've had it sitting under the plastic for 6 months collecting dust."
4,Great for Transferring Records to CPU,"I bought this for my dad about 7 months ago and he loves it. It was a bit of a pain to set up the first time with the sensitivity adjustment, but in retrospect we probably could have done it in half the time. The only other negative feature is that there is no cover to prevent dust from getting on the table. Still, my dad uses it all the time and has enjoyed listening to old records while he transfers them to his laptop. I believe the software that comes with this product also allows for a small amount of audio editing/cleanup. Good overall product."
3,Works great but time consuming.,"The product works great and is easy to install, but it's very time and memory consuming. You play the record at 45rpm, convert to 33rpm, divide up the tracks, name the tracks, then convert to MP3. The software Audacity that it comes with is easy enough to use, but I've read that Adobe Audition is better. Not sure why. Learning Adobe Audition is a much bigger project of its own and cost about $300. Audacity seems to do the job but filled up my hard drive pretty quick. Now that I'm done putting my 80's records in my computer, I'll probably sell or give this product to a friend."
4,Great Value and Ease of Use,"Very nice and simple to use turntable that connects directly to your pc via USB. It was a simple as plugging it in, loading the software and let her rip!Well OK, there was a little more to it than that but nothing that was earth shattering. A couple of configuration settings and basically that was it. I was ripping my vinyl to mp3's in no time.It uses Audacity as it's software and, while not my favorite, it was very simple to extrude each individual track.My only nit is that the turntable's exterior is made of plastic. I would have liked it to be more durable but for this price, well worth the small investment to save my 400 albums!"
3,Good buy,"This turntable is going to save my LPs from melting away, unheard for the rest of my life. The initial connection/set up was a bit tricky - specifically, getting the correct weight on the stylus and making the proper audio setting adjustments on my PC, but I emailed customer service and they pointed me in the right direction and I was recording music within minutes. Aside from that, the only drawback to this is that it doesn't have a dust cover. If you could get this with the dust cover and without having to drastically change the audio settings, I would have given this 5 stars but because of the extra work involved, it only gets 3."
3,Software Not Very Helpful,The company I bought this from went overboard to help me make this turn table usefull. Unfortunately the software company does NOT help in making this turn table work.
5,Easiest way to digitize your vinyl,"After waiting a year, and reading various reviews, some of which were not too flattering, I finally purchased the iTTUSB turntable. I have tried other products and programs designed to digitize vinyl records, but this product is by far the easiest I have found. What can be easier than loading the software, plugging the turntable into your computer, and getting the job done. You can even play the records at 45 RPM, and then slow the final digitized recording down to 33 RPM, which saves a little time in the process. The software does a fairly decent job of digitizing the music, and allowing it to be imported into my itunes library. Although others have complained about the software, if you follow the directions, and visit the appropriate website for the updates, you will have little trouble with the software. All in all, I am very happy with the process and the quality of the output."
3,"Nice, but audible oscillating hum in recordings","Just received this as a birthday gift and was excited about transfering some of my old vinyl. It popped up immediately in GarageBand as an available audio inteface. I had to lower the gain with the control knob under the unit though becuase it was turned all the way up causing it to clip in GarageBand. Everything seemed great until I listened a little closer. There is a very definite audible oscillating hum in the recordings at 33 1/3 RPM. You don't notice it as much at 45, but it's there too. It can be removed a bit with SoundSoap, but come on, do we need MORE noise to deal with when dealing with vinyl? Has anyone been able to resolve this?"
4,EASY TRANSFERS FOR DUMMIES,"I bought the ION TTUSB and have loved it, although my wife thinks I'm an idiot sitting in here doing these recordings with everything else I have to do. I had a problem with my Logtech videocam taking over during my second session. I unplugged it and haven't had a problem since. My unit came with two programs, 1 for Dummies and the other to mix, clean static, etc. I haven't progressed into the better program yet. It's great fun, get cha' one!!"
5,Voice of the Mummy Game Recordings,This unit works perfect for the small records from games of the past. I used this unit because it didnt have the tone arm reset built into it. The record is very small and because of the anti slip mat the record stayed in place during all of the recordings.The editing software works fine. It's quick to edit and easily removes the unwanted pops and clicks. It also has other software features to adjust the speed which was needed because of the custom speed these small records needed.Visit[...]and listen to the Mummy sounds and from the other Milton Bardley Game from 1972 Seance. Great job ION.
1,Ion TTUSB10 ???,"I bought An Ion TTUSB10 turntable last Christmas (9 months ago)and have still not been able to convert any of my vinyl to MP3s! I've tried to email Ion""s Tech Department and Audacity but received no reply from either! I had no trouble hooking the Ion up to my iMac and am running OSX version 10.4.11. I have loaded EZvinyl converter and have tried to use Audacity version 1.2.4 with no success at all.Before I got the Ion, I was converting my vinyl using my old sound system turntable with AudioX 3.2.1 and was having no problems. I was looking forward to the convenience offered by an Ion turntable, but so far with no success. I understand that Ethan Zuckerman has obtained some new information on linking an Ion to a Mac, but I have been unable to find an email address for him. Is there any way that I can get a clear list of instructions, ie: 1) Do this, 2) Then do this, 3) Now do this? Reach me at bestaviationart@yahoo.ca"
1,The Purchase from HELL!,"This is the worst purchase I ever made. The quality is terrible - and if there's a way of changing settings, the manual does not mention it. THERE IS NOTHING INTUITIVE ABOUT THE MENUING SYSTEM OR USE OF THIS PRODUCT. If a month or so goes by, I have to re-learn how to use this all over again. And to add insult to injury, you have to completely reconfigure your sound setting in control panel to be able to listen to your recording while you're recording. DON'T BUY THIS unless, of course, you're the person who has no life whatsoever and enjoys spending ten or twelve hours trying to get twenty or thirty minutes of music recorded. Oh, am I a neophyte? I'm a software designer!"
1,Horrible Service,I have purchased this product for my mother and have yet to see the product function. It has been properly set up & the device doesn't want to spin. I have tried to contact the company over and over with no success. They don't care to service the machine. I would not recommend this product at all and think they are a very bad company to do business with.
4,Bit Difficult,To eliminate souns that can be present at the very beggining or end of the recording. Instructions could be better.Easy to assemble. There is difficulty in savings the songs once they are transferred from LP to CD due to copyright considerations.
4,Ion Turntable a hit,This is a fine product. It produces good sound and allows easy transfer of our LPs to the computer. The price was excellent and setup was not too bad. My only criticism is that the unit does not come with a dust cover which means that the turntable surface will collect dust as tie goes by. Also the directions for transfer recording were rather minimal. You are largely on your own for operations.
4,Great Find to Record our old Records,"We were really excited to find this turntable and at such a reasonable price, too. We've already begun to transfer our record collection to CD and MP3. The only problem we found was when you record 78rpm in 45rpm and then change the speed, it sounds like there's a chipmunk singing in the background. That's the reason for the 4 stars. It is not difficult to operate or connect and found the instructions to be easy to understand. It took awhile to figure out how to remove the noise but followed the instructions closely and I was able to remove it. You have to download the Lame MP3 plugin to change the format to MP3 but it is worth it. Now I can have my old songs playing on my cell phone's MP3 player. Very happy with this turntable and the only thing we would change is it needs to come with a hinged cover and, of course, the 78rpm speed problem. I'd buy it again."
2,Ion Turntable,Turntable works to design and intent. Software requires prior knowledge of sound record and editing; not for the novice or those with limited experience. Support is non-existant; link for online instructions is inoperable. Cannot listen to sound while recording. Still do not have successful recording and am very disappointed. Would not purchase again. Sitting in a box on the floor.
4,record player review,"nice product for the money, also received this product two days from order, great service, one problem recording records onto blank cd."
5,Nice follow-up,"This product was originally sent without a key part (needle), but part was sent quickly and order completed without any problem."
1,IoniTTUSB Turntable,Everything was received in order. However once the turntable was hooked up and ready to record it would not play at 33 1/3 rpm's. You could adjust the recording speed in the software but it would not adjust to exactly 33 1/3 rpm.
4,It Works As Advertised,"I agree with the other comments about the included software. You would be much better off buying audio software from another source, such as Acoustica's Spin It Again or similar products. However, the product itself works as advertised and is a snap to set-up. Be prepared to spin a lot of time converting vinyl to PC files, especially if you are being selective in the tracks that you copy. In this case, you have two options: copy the entire album, then delete the songs that you don't want or record on the selected tracks. The second option takes constant monitoring, but no deletion of unwanted tracks. The first option only requires you to be present to flip the album to the other side. However, when it comes time to delete, be sure you know which tracks you want to delete, because there is no track information included with the conversion other than a track number (because vinyl didn't record such data)."
5,Fantastic Item,"I hesitated just a little before buying this item because of the mixed ratings on it. However, I thought it was a great item to help not lose my old albums. I connected the turntable and had no problems. I installed the software and had no problems. I can do everything I want to do with this and am greatly satisfied. Only thing I wish I would of bought one with a dustcover. Ion turn"
4,"Easy to Use, Great Value","I borrowed a turntable from a friend that wrote to CD. I used it to convert my vinyl LP's to mp3's for my iPod. When I inheritated a large collection of music on LP that spanned from the late 1950's to 1980's I started looking around for a USB turntable. I wanted to write directly to my hard drive. This Ion TTUSB Turntable has been great. Good quality sound at a great price. It's super easy to set up, and easy to use. It feels light weight when you're setting it up but it's been a solid performer. I've ripped about 60 LP's over the past 30 days and love it. Clean-up in Audacity is breeze."
4,It works well!,"I considered buying this turntable a long time before I finally made the commitment. I'd heard that some people could not get the software to work properly. However, when the Ion arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at how perfectly simple it was to set up and to use. And it does the job it's intended to do. I would give it a five-star rating except for 1) the instructions (not a major pain; just use your smarts); 2) the somewhat awkward interface of the software program; 3) the tediousness of having to keep an ear on tracks while it's recording them in real time so that you can separate one track from the next. Without doubt, this process of converting vinyl to digital is big time investment (especially if you have a huge collection, as I do), but the reward of having your treasures available to you on your computer or mp3 player cannot be overstated. The Ion turntable is a workhorse that gets the job done."
3,Meets a need,"Gave to my cousin as a gift - she has a HUGE vinyl collection and has always wanted to create CDs from favorites. Getting proper weighting on the stylus was difficult and it is VERY sensitive to scratches, etc - she has not worked with the included software, however. A $40 dustcover will need to be purchased - I feel it should come with one and I believe newer models do."
4,Ion TTUSB Turntable with USB Record,I bought this turntable so I could transfer all of my LP's to my PC and burn them to Cd's. The turntable does what it is supposed to do. I have had no problems transferring music from my records to my computers hardrive. The software that comes with it works fine.
1,Noisy,The output from the USB had a very high-pitched whine when powered on -- and the sound persisted whether the turntable was spinning or not. It was disappointing to return it because it looked just right for what I wanted.
1,ION ittusb turntable,"Could not get this turntable to play any albums without skipping, no matter how I adjusted it. All albums played fine on my stereo system. Sound was not very good either. Might be just one bad unit but I was not pleased with it at all."
4,Perfect for the price,"For years i was going to hook up my old turntable to my computer to record my old vinyl. well How easy did ION make it. I am not a techie by any means. Straight in to the USB port load software and you are off and running.Now it did take about an Hour after I did my first album to clean up and split tracks and I'm getting better,The Noise reduction software is not brilliant but does the job leaving a few crackles & pops. well worth the money. By the way this model was recomended to me by a friendwho lives in the UK (He paid almost twice as much over there for it)He loves it. I will add this though ""Where's the cover"""
3,opnion about Ion TTUSB Turntable USB Record bought to my father,"My father has been having a hard time in using the product. He has already installed it but he has not learned how to record his old long-plays. He has beeing doing it by himselsf but - I guess - there is not a manual in portuguese nor in espanish.So far, that's all I have do say about the product.I ordered the product from Brasil, where I live. It was deliveried in time in NYC, where I spent part of my vacations."
4,Obtuse directions,Turntable itself is fine. The directions were either written by someone for whom English is a second language or written for too many models and lumped into one booklet. Trial and error and common sense prevails.
4,phono to disk recorder,"The instructions are a little flakey, but doable. Great way to salvage the investment in your old lp's."
3,software easy to install but...,"I bought this to turn my lps into cds, but the crackle and pops that needed to be removed were not easy with using the software that came with this hardware. I will continue to study and try."
3,Not for Mac users,"If you are only using it as a turntable the sound is very good. If you are a Mac user and try to record the songs into your Mac, the software is poor and does not work!"
3,ION TTUSB10,"The turntable took a little while to set up and synch with my PC, but worked great once I figured it out. Can't say the same for the editing SW (Audacity) that came with it. This is the most complicated, non-user friendly software I have come accross in a long time. That they have the audacity to ship it with such a great turn table is beyond me. Unless you plan on recording everything perfectly from the turntable or allowing yourself several hours/days to figure out the SW or find another way to edit your songs, don't buy this product."
4,nice table,"nice turntable, easy to set up, have not tried creating digital copies of my classical colection but priced right even without digi conversion option. Not sure why product does not have dust cover standard."
5,Better than expected,"Read the 5 star reviews and the 1 star reviews befor ordering. Since I am not an electronics wizard, looked for something easy to install and use. This is it! I had no problem with the instructions (just be sure read and follow them all) and the results were great. I was able to input LPs that would not play on my regular turntable and the quality of the copy depends on the quality of the LP being copied, but generally improved using the Audacity software. The basic software doesn't eliminate all the clicks but there is Soap for the purists. My first attempt took some time (overlooked some of the instructions) but now using the product is seamless. My system is Windows XP. The product is great for doing what it is advertised to do. It was also mentioned in my latest KIPLINGER magazine."
4,get the program up date from manufactor,Works above what I imagined after I got the updated infro ( PROGRAM FROM MANUFACTOR) and BE careful needle breaks easly.
5,Ion turntable,What a simply outstanding product. The quality is the best and I can now turn my record collection into CDs
4,USB turntable,"I finally found a way to save all my old, and precious albums. There were a few kinks with iTunes, but once those were ironed out, the turntable worked fine. I've recorded 10 of my albums to CD already, and plan to do them all eventually. This was very reasonable and a great value for the investment."
4,Great Product - does what it says it will do.,This product is easy to set up and use. It does what it says it will do. The only drawback I have found is that the stylus arm is manually operated so you need a steady hand...no lever or automatic placement is available.
2,"Not the best solution, causes headaches.","We purchased this turntable to add a bunch of records to iTunes (duh). It took forever to get the counterweight adjusted properly, and after fiddling with the output (we wanted to use stereo plugs, didn't work, switched to USB) we got some ok sound out of it for a few records. However, depending on what record we used and the weather, it decided to give us tinny soft in-and-out sound for a while. Kept fiddling, did research, nothing helped.Sent it back for refund, bought a phono preamp for the classic turntable instead. Sound quality much better, uses all the queuing, pressure, etc of a nice quality turntable which we already had, cheaper, uses your computer's audio hardware, and worked on the first try after plugging everything in. ION counts on people thinking these are going to be easier to use than this more logical setup. They're wrong."
2,"Great Idea, not so great product","I was expecting a great product here, but i did not get one.First off, the record player did not have a cover to protect the machine, which is expensive to buy.Secondly, when we started recording, the record player was able to pick up background noise, which ruined the quality.And lastly, the gain/volume control for it is on the back in one of the most awkward places ever.So, unless you have a very quite house, patience, and a lot of vinyl cleaner, you might consider this, but you could just hook your old record player up to an amp and buy a 1/8 to RCA cable for 1 cent.RiteAV - 3.5mm to Stereo RCA Male Cable - 6 ft.Or even a 1/8 cable with a 1/4 adapter to plug into the headphones slot of the amp and then into the computer.Monster AI STUDIOLINK iStudioLink 1/4-Inch Mono Female to 1/8-Inch Stereo Male Instrument Interconnect Cable"
4,Service,The ION TTUSB USB Turntable with USB record. It was shipped and arrived with a week. in a well padded original box. After unpacking I discovered it was missing the USB cable and the software to install and use the Turntable. It arrived on a Saturday and I called the shipper on Monday. they placed a missing parts order with ION and the missing parts was in my hands by the end of that week. The software is very easy to use (recording) I havent taken the time to learn how to clean the noise that is for another time. The only thing I would have liked to have is a lid of some kind.
3,It's ok for Mac,"After tinkering around with it and downloading the Mac software, my Husband has been very pleased to convert his 80's records to mp3."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This product is horrible. The sound quality worse. It is poorly made, and the recording quality dismal. I think ion moles are leaving the positive reviews. Read the negative reviews before purchasing."
1,Did not work,I could not get any sound out of the turn table when plugged into my computer. I also did not know that it can take up to 5 hours to make one cd. The unit was not what I thought it would be and I returned it for a refund. I would not recommend this unit.
1,Very disappointed,"I had many quibbles that I was prepared to overlook if the ease of use made up for them. The single, un-leapable hurdle is that the sound quality sucks swamp water. In my opinion, no buyer will ever be satisfied to listen to this machine's interpretation of their old albums. Save your money and all of the hassle I will have to go through to somehow return this thing."
2,Why you should buy CDs,"This device pretty much does what it says it will, but their is a caveat, of course. If your vinyl isn't in mint condition, and I mean PRISTINE, it's not worth owning this turntable. The included software is capable of removing the snap, crackle and pop from a new album, but older records are a disaster. Perhaps if you are a professional, with all the time in the world to perfect a recording, this turntable might be the ticket. However, for the casual user that just wishes to tranfer his vinyl to CD, this gizmo is a lot like work. It takes well over an hour to record an album, work the kinks out, and burn a CD. If you make your own labels, add another 30 minutes. The time spent to money saved ratio is absurd. Instead of buying this turntable, blank CDs, jewel cases, labels, and ink, just go on eBay and buy the CDs for cheap."
1,Ion iT TUSB Turntable ubs record too hard to used,"THE Ion iT TUSB turntable is too hard to download or record from the computer. I have tried many of times to record from the computer by reading the installation guide book, and I call for techical support but still will not downioad or record. I do not want this turntable and I will like to return and a refund. Please send me information on refunding and returning."
1,bad tech support,"The function that supposedly allows you to patch in CD players, tape players, etc. and play through the USB connection did not work and repeated emails to Ion tech support went unanswered. I'm returning it. No more cyber commerce for me."
1,Buyer beware!,Beware of the ION iTTUSB turntable. The cartridge is cheap. It made my records sound worse. The Audacity software is unusuable. The manual is 133 pages long. The software is not user unfriendly. You will miss having a dust cover!
4,A Point Regarding the Software!,"The AUDACITY software manual is ""the gold standard"" for how to write a computer software manual in plain English. The wording and the pictures made it extremely straight-forward to understand how to set up the USB sound to work with the Ion Turntable on an XP-Pro computer.As for the turntable, it does what it is supposed to do. I would prefer a dust cover, a cue lever, and a better quality slipmat, but I suppose it is not intended for long-term home stereo use."
3,Finally!,"I found this turntable to not be user friendly. I was having so much trouble getting started that I tried to contact the company. No luck there,I am still waiting for a response. Fortunately, I finally got a friend to help me. Now it works fine. I would like it better if it had a cover."
1,ZERO Customer/Technical Support,I have yet to get this device working with VISTA. I have sent multiple e mails to ION support and have not rececived a single reply. It would seem that this company does care about anything but getting your money and they certainly do not care if their device works or not.
5,Ion iTTUSB Turntable,"Works very well. Fairly easy to set up and use. If you have vinyl and want to preserve it, this is it. Reasonably priced and shipped promptly. Merchandise every bit as good as advertised. Reasonable shipping cost. I highly recommend it. If you get one, you'll enjoy it."
1,Doesn't work,We received two of them and spent hours and hours with tech support on both shipments. They told us to send it back both times. Don't waste your time with it.
1,Ion iTTUSB Turntable bad service,"Unit received missing ""cartridge"" after several calls and e-mails to manufacturer I was promised the missing part. When did not arrive I was told it was back-ordered and would be shipped when received by them. That was more than a month ago and I still do not have the ""cartridge"", without which the unit cannot be used. This is unacceptable!Joseph A. Blitt"
1,Horrible Quality Or Lack There Of,The head shell is canted so many degrees outward that it's impossible to get the needle down safely onto a record. There is no sound whatsoever coming out either though it's registering on both channels and tearing up my test record. I would avoid this product at any and all costs. Mine is being returned today.
4,I really needed this!,"This product is everything the manufacturer promised. It is very solidly made, works well, and is easy to use. Small snag: the Audacity software was not included on the CD, as promised, although the manual was included! However, they provided the URL of the Audacity website, and it takes only a few minutes to download the latest version of the software, including the appropriate manual.I'm very happy!"
1,Why didn't I check the web??????,"Ion Audio iTTUSB 10 Vinyl Recording USB Turntable with Audacity Software, Dust Cover and Analog Stereo InputI run a Mac OSX. I bought a USB 10. Spent an hour with software. Called and tech assist. said it was no good and sent me E-Mail. Tried it and static occurred. Spoke to two tech assistants who said it was a shield problem. Returned it to store.. Played the second one. Static again. Called again. Spoke to three people this time. Third one suggested I call Tech Level 2. Guy finally admitted they were having problems with Macs. Suggested I try lap top. I did and still more static. I spent about 8 hrs trying all this out. Why don't they all just admit it doesn't work with the Mac. Complete waste of time. If you are running a Mac OSX I suggest you don't waste yours. Happy New Year!"
5,Ittusb Turntable,"It does what it said it would do, not only have I done 33 1/3 and 45 records but also cassettes and my old 8 tracks that stay togeather long enough to record. Thank You."
4,doc's recomendations,"This turntable is a very good device,except for a couple of things.They are a cue lever and a dust cover.It records very nice,is easy to setup and use."
5,ittsub turntable,"Ion iTTUSB Turntable with USB RecordThe software is incredibly easy to install and to use. So far, since I've copied my first record into ITunes, the only hitch is that I can no longer burn a CD from ITunes. I'm working that issue now."
4,Turn the tables,The turntable works just fine to transfer vinyl recordings to my computer with the help of CD Spin Doctor 2.
4,Great for the price,"I am not an audiophile by any means, but I was looking for an inexpensive and functional turntable and this perfectly fit the bill. My only complaint is that the body is made of plastic and feels cheap."
4,Fantastic!!,"Like a goofball I bought this before I read all the reviews.. After I received it I started to read them and was terrified by what some people had said about not getting sound.. Not to worry though.. Read the instructions.. I love this piece of equipment!! It works like a charm..about the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it takes a while to get a whole side of an album copied and get the titles on it, but other than that - I've been really impressed with the way these songs sound. I even had one song that had a skip in it - but not anymore *G* Some I even left the vinyl popping sound on and it sounds just like I'm listening to vinyl instead of a cd.. Yep - I do NOT regret buying this at all!!!!"
3,Ion Turntable review,The product was easy to connect and to load the software. It works fine for 33 RPM records. So far I have not been able to get it to work for either 45 or 78 RPM records. Nothing records. My primary reason for purchasing the product was to be able to archive and preserve my fathers old 78s and my old 45s. Since I have yet to be able to do that I am not very happy with the product.I will try again and then contact customer service.Jeff Homewood301-475-8327 (Eve)301-863-4329 (days)
3,great to save the vinyl,i loved the concept- however the software was difficult to make work with my existing programsand I doubt if someone that did not have computer savy would be able to coordinate the programs needede. I love down loading from my vintage vinyl to my computer and burning to discs .
1,Christmas Dud,"I purchased this product for my boyfriend for Christmas. He followed all the steps for setting it up, and even called the manufacturer for assistance, but was never able to get it to work. He was very disappointed and had to return it for a refund."
4,Good value,"For the price, this is an excellent product. I have just a few small beefs - no dust cover, RCA wires dangling, no tone arm cue, cheap slip mat, software a bit cumbersome to navigate. Overall, I am very happy with the quality of the recordings, and now I can finally listen to all of my out-of-print vinyl on CD. I have yet to do whole albums; I have only been converting 12"" remix singles, and so far am pleased. I haven't yet used some of the fancier aspects of the software."
4,great timesaver for burning vinyl,"All these reviewers complain of cheap construction and lack of frills but I'd imagine all these people, like myself, have another turntable. I would not recommend this as your only turntable but for the job of burning your vinyl to your hard drive, this is a godsend. Setup seemed pretty straight forward although I have a Vaio, not a Dell, so I can't speak for that system. If you want to burn MP3's, you will need to download LAME, a quick google search away. Remember where you put Lame on your hard drive as you will need to tell Audacity (the Ion software program) where the Lame_enc.dll driver is the first time you make an MP3. I burned my first album with in an hour of opening the box. I see many happy hours ahead of me with my Ion!"
2,OK,Not worth the money you spend or the time you will never get back trying to get it to work!..Save your $$
1,Terrible and don't even own one,"After reading the reviews, running a demo version of the software and attempting to get to the ion site, this is an awful alternative to just buying the CDs of my albums. I own over 350 LPs and have done extensive research in locating their CD counterparts without issue. One particular review captured my eye which prompted me to download the software and run a simulated ""rip"" of and LP. The reviewer was correct! The process vs. CD purchase is a no-brainer. The time, cost and quality ratio is out to lunch. Even with a simulated rip, there is no question one would be better off just researching for themselves (all of a few hours for 100's of vinyls) and buying the CDs. One other point to make is the ion site is still trying to load as I write this review, enough said..."
3,cd's,Ion iTTUSB Turntable with USB RecordNo problem making CD's but can not play on my regular CD player.Still I enjoy playing my LP's on the player.Is there a way to make cd's that can be played on a regular CD player?Ben Cooper
4,Works Great,"I finally get to listen to all my old albums in my car. It has more than paid for itself. The software documentation is a bit confusing and needs more detail, but for the basics, its pretty good."
3,ion usb turntable,"the software(audacity) that comes with it is hard to get to learn how to use. also, I still haven't figured out how to eliminate the ""natural vinyl sounds"" associated with an aged and well used l. p.!!"
4,USB Turntable is Easy to Use,"I've been looking for an easy way to convert my vinyl collection to digits, and this meets that need. It is lightweight, portable, and comes with easy to use software (if you read the rule book first!) It's not the prettiest thing but it does the job. Don't expect it to be as solid as the turntables of the past. It says it can also convert cassette tapes (cables included) but I haven't tried that yet.Ion iTTUSB Turntable with USB Record"
1,Returning the turntable,"Very disappointing! The Platter is warped making it impossible to listen to the records. The platter wobbles and there is no way to fix it.Found other reviews and found that other people had the same ""wobbly"" experience!"
4,ION USB Turntable,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he seems to be very happy with it. We did have some issues at the beginning, though. It was very easy to set up and as long as you take the time to read the instructions (as with most things) all goes well. It was very dissappointing once we had it all set up and ready to go only to find that the tone arm wouldn't move. We had several phone encounters with customer service that were either no help or little help - long wait times on hold (over 20 minutes), dropped calls, reps trying to pass the responsibility to Amazon, etc. We finally got through to someone who knew what to do, which was send it back to ION so they could fix it. We did think it unfair that we had to pay for shipping on a defective product, but the turnaround time was very quick (two weeks) and now it is working perfectly."
1,No tech support,"The problem started after installation of equipment. The on-screen opening page to start recording did not match the picture in the instruction book. There was no microphone to click on, as instructed. Efforts to reach the support phone number listed on the instruction books was no longer in service. How do you suggest contacting this alleged support team? Houston we have a problem! (Turntable is well made and works great through my system.)"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"The product information lists an adjustable pitch control, but there is none on the hardware! Please see discussion forum for same experience from latest buyers."
5,USB Turntable,"This unit works well for the novice.....I have recorder about 45 albums now and unit works well. The 3 star rating on durability comes from the stylus was weak, dropped arm on a record and it bent and was unusable....however, ordered a new cartridge and the sound improved....all is well"
3,Good Product?,"I'm not very educated about technology for the most part, so this product is difficult for me to use. The instructions were adequate to help me figure out how to put the turntable together, but the software portion is pretty worthless. It only covers older versions of Windows. Nothing new, which is what I have. I'm sure it would work perfectly if I could figure out how to set my computer's settings to what they need to be."
1,This product is not for all computers,"I think I was deceived into thinking this turntable would work on my computer. It's too bad I couldn't get it to work on my pc which is a Dell, because I have a ton of LPs. I wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered it, because I've read about two to three people had the same problem I had, where there was no sound coming out of the speakers. I emailed tech services and all I got was some technical mumble jumble so disapointedly I had to send it back."
1,Still waiting to find out how good it is . . .,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It's August and we still haven't been able to use it. It will not run on XP. Period. There is no fix. So we have to break down and get a new computer running Vista so we can use it. Not a happy husband.My UPDATE is that we now have a computer running Vista, and of course they came out with a better version of the turntable before we were able to get this one up and running. My husband loves that he can finally record his old vinyl and cassette tapes to mp3, but having to go in and manually separate and label the individual tracks is quite time consuming and a real pain. If you have the time to spend, it's a good deal. Four stars."
3,"It works well, but is not of very high fidelity","I don't regret this purchase, but the quality of the mp3s resulting are a little disappointing. The results, of course, are no better than the orginal record, so take that into account. On the other hand, if you are a hobbyist and like to mess around with these things, it is fun to have. And then there are those records that are not available digitally."
4,Not blown away but not disappointed,"WIsh it came with a dust cover.Initially, the speed seemed a bit slower when playing a record I owned on cd. The difference was noticeable. Some mild tweaking to the belt and it seems to be playing at a normal speed. Have yet to use the USB feature."
4,TURNTABLE GREAT! SOFTWARE NOT SO GREAT,"Turn table worked as stated. Simply plug into your computer and install the driver and your good to go. However, when I tried to load the software the CD could not be read by my latop? I double checked to make sure it was not my CD reader by reading other CD's and all checked out ok. I ended up having to download the software from manufactures website. The software still does not work 100% but I'm able to work around it. If your not very computer literate I would not recommend."
1,Need a cure for insomnia?,"I love philosophy, so when my religious high school made me read this, I thought it might be interesting. Goodness I was wrong. I understand that my lack of religious convictions makes me not the target audience, but I feel it should still be moderately interesting."
2,Slapsash Biblical exposition,"You'd be better advised to spend your time with these three lovely Bible books than with Kreeft's superficial work on them. I tend generally to agree with Kreeft on theological and cultural issues, but there's a slapdash quality to his books that can get on one's nerves. Kreeft tends to force the text he's expounding to say what he's determined it's darned well going to say. For example, I don't buy Kreeft's idea that Ecclesiastes tells us what life is like without God."
2,Irrelevant gibberish meant to sound intelligent.,"I was required to read this book for Modern Theological Questions class. I found it a general rambling of obscure references and useless analogies. I did find some of the ideas presented extremely intriging. However, it lacked solid reason when presenting ideas, therefore making it highly nonbelievable. (I apologize for any speeling mistakes)"
1,Money in the trash!!!,"How many things can I say are wrong with the system I bought. It died conveniently after the warranty expired. I had to wrestle with it to get my dvd back. When it did display pictures, it would frequently pause in the middle of the movie. I would recommend spending the extra money on a better quality system. Save yourself money and frustration in the long run. Don't learn like I did."
4,Great product for the low price,"This is not the best dvd player/audio system out there. But it sure does it job really well. I've never had any problems with the unit. I use it with my projector to watch movies and also uses it to play the songs in my ipod. The sound quality is acceptable and can produce really lound output. It can also play photos, mp3 cds etc... Overall a great buy for the price."
3,Pretty good book,"Attention! is a good book. It's definitely not the best one in the Adweek series (Disruption, Beyond Disruption, Eating the big fish and Hey Whipple are better books). The only major problem with it is that it contains examples from dotcom companies (the book was obviously written before the dotcom crash)...I think it even says that a 56k net connection is extremely fast a couple of times..."
4,"6 chambers, 1 bullet","If you want to know how it is to live the life of a patch holder, read Sonnys' books. He does a great job. I liked the way he used an Independent to stay with his stepson (so to speak) while Patch is in the joint. That tells me that he feels that some of us Bikers are true to the core, even though we don't wear patches. I found this book slow to start,but fast to finish."
4,Another homerun for Sonny!,"This as many as Sonny's books, was a easy read. The book kept you interested from the first page to the last and even though it's supposed to be fiction, one would wonder how much of Sonny's life influences his writing."
5,Great as always.,Sonny brings it once again. He takes his experience from decades of running with the best and draws from it to produce good biker fiction. I look forward to his next book and of course upcoming movie.
5,GREAT BOOK!,Highly entertaining and well written. I had a great time reading this one. I can't wait for the next book in this series!!!
5,"Great, long lasting socks!",I love these socks. My last pair survived heavy use for 5 years. Well worth the investment! Not too thick either.
4,Almost gives you everything it promised - ALMOST.,"I love Astron-6, they have an amazing amount of talent and are a force to be reckoned with in terms of up and coming horror film greats - but when I heard that it included the soundtrack and was supposed to included a making of Documentary - I was disappointed to find out the the soundtrack wasn't that awesome 80's synth soundtrack but a cheesy rock band only accompaniment. I am glad to have this in my collection, it was well done and well packaged - but I would of loved to see the making of Documentary and wish the soundtrack included here, was the actual soundtrack and not a few rock band songs. Still support Astron-6, these guys need to keep making movies!"
2,Disapointed,"I read some pretty positive stuff about this movie so i ended up renting it, glad I didnt buy it. It was supposed to be really gory and have some real questionable material....meh. Its very rare that I give a horror movie a negative review, even the low budget crap ones but this movie just didnt do it for me."
5,YES THIS IS A DVD AND BLU RAY +,"ENJOY THIS AWESOME 4 DSIC SET FROM TROMA! AND YES IT WILL HAVE A DVD VERSION AS WELL A BLURAY, PLUS A CD WITH THEN SOUNDTRACK AS WELL A BONUS DISC, THIS SHOULD HAVE ALL THE ASTRON-6 SHORS INCLUDED ON THIS AS WELL. JUST HOP OVEDR TO TROMA'S SITE OR LOOK FOR SOME HARCORE HORROR SITES. RUE MORGUE, HORRORHOUND, ETC. CHECK EM OUT MANY GOOD ONES AND SO MUC INFO, YOU SHOULD HAVE NEIGH AN ISSUE FINDING DETAILS AT THIS POINT"
4,A powerful but frustrating read,"This is an essential book for Coltrane lovers, especially because of the interviews with Coltrane, McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones. As for the rest of the book, it is at times illuminating but too often frustrating. Kofsky's dogmatic Marxism does not help his overall points about the role of racial issues in the Jazz revolution. His anecdotes about the musicians are great, but his analyses of them are too one-sided. He doesn't consider the possibility that for some of them, the revolution was more about art than politics (not that the two can't be related). The interviews with Tyner and Jones show this as well -- Kofsky keeps trying to get them to say that their artistic decisions were politically motivated, but this doesn't seem to be the case.This book is definitely worth reading, but be prepared to disagree with Kofsky's approach, unless you're a Marxist."
4,The Politics of Jazz,"There are a lot of books on jazz and plenty on the subject of Black liberation. What makes this book special is how it combines a serious musical analysis of jazz-as in the chapter on Elvin Jones' drumming-with an understanding of the social and political dimensions of the music-as in the piece on jazz as a weapon of the Cold War. Kofsky takes on a range of music critics to argue the case for considering jazz as distinctively Black music. And he shows how John Coltrane and his collaborators had to fight to maintain their musical integrity in a business dominated by white critics, promoters, club owners and the like. Occasionally, the book reads like a personal vendetta by Kofsky against particular jazz critics, which is distracting. But for anyone who wants to understand better the connections between jazz music and the politics of the 1960s, this is a very useful book."
1,Ripped,"My dog wore it for a week maybe and he started chasing after another dog. As I pulled his leash which connected to the collar, the collar ripped. Really disappointed since these things are supposed to be able to support large dogs. Oh and my dog is only 35lbs."
5,The only Atlas you will need,"The best single resource for driving across the state or across the country. Roads the otherguys haven't even heard of, let alone thought about publishing, are well documented in this Atlas. You won't even think twice about leaving the interstates with this handy tool at your side.Reviewer not responsible for your added enjoyment of the countryside, or relaxed demeanor at destination."
5,Just Listen,"I have had this album for more than 20 years. It is a classic of American music. I can listen to Tennessee Stud over and over again. If anyone is not familiar with this music, please try it. You won't regret it."
5,Forget the rest of the soundtrack..,What is the music played in the Russian nightclub? 'coz I'm not hearing it on the soundtrack. Easily the most powerful track.. But what is it?! Anyone know?
4,Looking for the Moscow Club track???,"If you have bought the soundtrack and have discovered that the song from the Moscow Club scence where the russian assasian is sitting with the ladies, Fear not! It's called ""Intothinair"" by Mocean Worker and can be found on his album, ""Aural & Hearty""."
5,What a delightful tale!,R.A. MacAvoy's Tea with the Black Dragon is the tale of a woman named Martha MacNamara brought west to San Francisco by her daughter's disappearance and of the man who changed her life: a mysterious Asian gentleman named Mayland Long who risked his ancient magic powers for her in a battle against modern-day computer wizardiy. It is an elegantly crafted contemporary fantasy by a remarkable new writer.
2,"Well, the title's great, but....","I think I must be the only person in the world who doesn't like this book. LOVE the title. LOVE the concept-- Mayland Long, the man who used to be a Black Dragon. But after that, it was all downhill. The writing did nothing for me. The story was kinda boring. I really didn't care what happened... but I rallied on, hoping it'd get better. For me, it didn't. It was barely a fantasy novel, with Mayland's past being really the only fantasy part of the story.But, a lot of people really like this, and I'm hoping it's merely a case that it wasn't my cup of tea (no pun intended)."
3,"OH, The Potential","Several people told me to read this book and I did, but, I must admit to a bit of disappointment.The story line was original and the plot worked but it didn't have the flesh to it. It wasn't satisfying at all. I understand that the next in the series is better but this one fell a bit flat for me.Also the constant description of the physical attributes of the main characters got to me a bit. I would love to see it re-released but with much more about the Black Dragon and much more interaction between the characters. I didn't hate it, but I expected much more from it."
3,quirky,"A short book that is hard to classify. Part romance, part detective novel, and part urban fantasy (though this was written several years before the term came into vogue). A pleasant book, that I think I would have enjoyed more if the fantasy element had been developed more than it was."
5,Delicious!,"Martha Macnamara travels to California to visit her daughter, only to discover that she is missing. She meets an unusual and mysterious man by the name of Mayland Long. Together they try to find Martha's daughter.This book was compelling. It was beautifully written and it just sucked me in. Written in the early 80's, it's computer references were obscure and dated to me. But that's not a bad thing for me. I enjoy reading books that are a little dated because it is interesting to see how the author moves around the story without cell phones, etc. This book was clearly written by a master. It's short, but packs a real punch. The characters were very real. The character of Mayland Long reminded me a lot of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's character, Pendergast. I am not quite sure why, but he is one of my favorite literary characters, so it's a good comparison. It's going on my permanent shelf and I am highly recommending it to any fellow fantasy lovers out there."
5,"A fascinating blend of fantasy, psychology, and phiolosophy.","R.A.MacAvoy once more demonstrates her profound ability to combine the mystic elements of fantasy, psychological insights, and philosophy (in this case, eastern philosophy) into an absorbing and believable gestalt. This novel is so interesting on so many levels that every time I read it I get something new from it -- the mark of truly great literature in my opinion. Even now that most of the layers of symbolism (and anti-symbolism) and meaning are becoming familiar to me, I still find the interactions between those layers a continuing source of fascination. All of this plus Ms.MacAvoy's tremendous gift for interesting language and engrossing story telling make this book a must read."
5,Tea with the Black Dragon is lyrical and exquisite,"A jewel of a novel. Fantasy set in the present day, with strong characters, a delicately realized descriptive style and a sense of dreamlike resonance. It's a crime this book went out of print and I only hope that requests bring it back into print soon. I know I buy it wherever I can find it."
5,"Happy Days Season 1, Better Than Later Seasons","Before I had bought Season 1 of Happy Days I had watch a couple episodes from later seasons, and I have to say that I prefer these episodes from season 1. Here are my reasons: these season 1 episodes were filmed with a single camera setup which I think gives the show a more 50's feel which is the time period in which the show is based, also these episodes were made before the show was almost changed to ""Fonzie's Happy Days"" and therefore the main characters are a little more balanced. Also instead of being filmed in front of live studio audience like the later seasons, these episodes were filmed with laugh tracks, so you don't hear a scream every time Fonzie enters a scene."
5,Arguably the best sitcom around,Loved watching Happy Days as a kid. Too bad it got stupid later with the live audience. The series started off great and then went downhill fast. The first 2 seasons are the best by far. Season 3 is merely okay and then in later seasons the annoying live audience started behaving like they were part of the show. I give this season 1 dvd 5 stars.Amazon - why the hell did you list the star of season 1 and 2 as Scott Baio when Ron Howard was the main character? Baio wasn't on season 1 at all and didn't make his first appearance until sometime after season 4!!! Someone on your staff really screwed up!
5,Nostaligic Television Genius,"When Happy Days premiered in 1974 I was five years old. So, needless to say, I grew up with the Cunninghams and The Fonz on our television set each week. Looking at the DVDs as an adult, I figured some of the nostalgia would have worn off as it has with so many other TV shows that I loved as a kid. Being that the first season of Happy Days wasn't really geared for children . . . it was mainly about Richie trying to score with chicks or see them strip or whaterever . . . I still sat down with my 14 year-old daughter and watched the show in its entirety and was pleased by it. A few of the episodes I didn't even remember, which was cool. All in all, what a great show it was. Looking back, it still stands up even after all these years. I just purchased Luverne & Shirley and started watching that, and I gotta say . . . these shows rock! With so much drivel out there now, it's great to be able to pop in the DVDs and escape all the crap currently residing on TV."
3,The cover is all wrong!,Nice set but the cover is all wrong! In the First Season Fonzie wore a White Windbreaker not a Black Leather Jacket. The producers would not let the Fonz wear his famous leather jacket the first season because they thought it would make him look like a hoodlum. After the First Season Henry Winkler convinced them to let Fonzie wear the Leather Jacket.
5,"Happy Days, Happy Dad","I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my dad. He mentioned he wished old shows were available on netflix so I took a gamble in buying this for him. The gift was a total hit, you could tell it made him very nostalgic. I watched a few episodes with him and it reminded me of being a little girl watching the reruns with him. Great product and good price."
3,Great show - dishonest packaging,"The show gets five stars. However the dishonest packaging gets 1 star (hence the average of three). Nowhere on the package does it mention that you're only getting 16 episodes. (Evidently Happy Days began as a mid-season replacement.) Instead they filled three DVDs only to half their capacity (6,5, and 5 episodes respectively) and put them in a standard 3/4 inch thick box and are charging the same 30-something dollars that they charge for a typical 24 episode complete season. A shameful rip-off (although I must admit that I would have bought it anyway so I guess I can't complain too much)."
3,No Extras?,"I am a Happy Days fan. I love the show. But to have absolutely NO extras on this DVD is inconceivable to me. Especially for the 30th anniversary. Not even the Love, American Style episode?"
4,Happy Days are here again!,"For those of us who, in 1974 were hoping for American Graffiti in TV sitcom form, the first season fulfilled all expectations. Seasons 2 and 3, marked by broader comedy and wildly cheering live audiences, also hold up well. But, watch out! Once Fonzie ""jumps the shark"" in season 4, the show becomes a parody of itself. Still, compared with most '70s sitcoms, Happy Days ages very well. Though this is a ""Must Have DVD"", fans will be left wondering, ""Ayyyyyyy! Where are the special features?"" There are NO commentaries, NO bloopers, NO behind-the-scenes documentaries, NOTHING. C'mon Paramount, let's sweeten the pot for the Season 2 DVD, and you'll get 5 Stars from us fans. Throw in a Fonzie action figure, and you might get 6."
3,Early Days were not their Happiest,"When I got Season One I almost questioned myself for having liked the series. Then when I got Season 4 I remembered why I enjoyed it. Season 1 is OK though for more laughs and more Fonz, start with later seasons. There's a reason they made Fonzerelli more central to the show - he's more interesting. This first season is ok but not exceptionally entertaining."
3,Serious Days In This Season 3 1/2 Stars Out Of 5 Stars,"Unlike the seasons that follow the first this one is the most serious dealing with such issues ranging from the beginning of the Cold War to high school drop outs. This season gets few laughs in what issues it tackle.As a huge fan of the show I was a LITTLE disappointed by the shows on the DVD there are few good episodes that manage to stand out- ""Fonzie Drops In"", and ""Someone Stole Potsie Bike."" But, not enough to save us from a real dark season.The show is better in seasons to come- so don't base judgements solely on the first...With no special DVD features I was a little disappointed.... I really wanted to see what became of the cast that was in the show. All in all I'd watch the re-runs on TV Land and wait for better seasons to come. Because these days are rather dark...."
5,the fonz got me through my divorce,i was going through a difficult time with my life and then i remembered this show happy days and then i bought it and in the end i realized i dont need love as long as ive got the fonz
3,Nostalgic Teen Show,"A funny story of teenage pupils played by much older actors in tight jeans, tight shirts and black leader jackets, exercising sex on the doorsteps of the post-sexual revolution seventeens."
3,the release should be like MASH,"For those of you that remember, the first season of Happy Days was filmed on a regular soundstage and therefor had an insideous laugh-track. Later seasons (at least with Ron Howard) blossomed when the show was filmed with an always energetic studio audience. But the first season is coming out and I don't see any reference to Paramount releasing it with (like the wonderful M*A*S*H sets) the option of viewing the episodes without the marred canned laughter. If it isn't then shame on Paramount and I'll hold off for Taxi and future seasons of Cheers and Fraiser!"
1,Failed after one charge.,"For $7.95 did not expect much and that is what I got. The retractable cord is way to thin and showed bare wire after two or three extends and retracts. After one charge the unit failed to charge. After some more extends and retracts more bare wire apeared. Chalked it up to "" There ain't no free lunch. Thanks for nothing."
3,"So, so",There are some nice songs on this CD but it is certainly a stretch to call it the all time greatest movie songs. Many are songs you never heard of from movies you never heard of.
1,The All Time Greatest Movie Garbage!,"This is, in my opinion, one of the worst collections of music available. Period. The music on this CD is overproduced and lacking any kind of soul. Don't waste the time or money!"
1,WHAT? How about a negative amount of stars!,Aw-ful! This is HARDLY a collection of the greatest movie songs ever. This collection represents some of the worst music ever recorded. This is horendous!
5,THE Ones you remeber,These are the songs we remember with the movie With the original singers and bands.A delight after so many cover bands
5,A Great Guide to Understanding the Bible,"This is a fantastic book for several reasons:First, as it expounds on the experiences of the patriarchs and prophets, the reader can see clearly the reasons why God acted in the ways that He did. This removes a great deal of the arbitrariness that sometimes seems to accompany the actions of God in the Bible.Second, it often relates different stories in the Bible which serves to reiterate the principle being illustrated. Here the foundation is laid for a greater, broader understanding of all the Bible, because it teaches the reader how to study it.Third, it is composed of many short chapters, which makes it great as a devotional aid. This makes contemplation and application easier within the short time available to the busy reader.If you like this book, you will also like the others in the series: ""Prophets and Kings,"" the Desire of Ages,"" ""The Acts of the Apostles,"" and especially ""The Great Controversy,"" which covers modern times."
1,Patriarchs and Profits,"Sorry have not read it yet, but I'm sure it will be great. Thank you for suggesting it!. Sorry. also have not read the on!"
5,A very meaningful book,This not only is helpful in understanding old testament stories but shows the depth of how Jesus is a part of life from beginning to the end.
3,Outback Lifestyle,Revealed traditions of the indigenous people of the Kimberleys. Exposed an interesting dilemma between the European settlers and the aborigines. Storyline faltered at times.
5,The Songmaster,"This is a great read, can pick it up and reluctantly put it down, a believable story very well told, Di Morrissey is a australian author who tells a great story."
5,Works perfectly.,"While I have yet to try other types of clickers, I can say that this one works more ergonomically friendly than others look like they would. I ordered this particular clicker because it has an outward button, rather than the kind that require your thumb to push down into the case of the clicker. I could be wrong, but it seems like the case would get in the way, at times, without the outer button that is on this clicker. Anyhow, it works as it should, is very comfortable to use, and has held up to this point. I have had this product for about three months."
3,Holy Caffeine Batman!,I've tried these products before. Ususaly to jump start a diet and help keep that motivation going. x32 was fine but I figured I would try this since it's new. Now I know why they are selling it so cheap! There is 200mg of caffeine in one pill. So the minimum recomended dose is 4 pills a day bringing you to 800mg of caffeine?! Thats about 8 cups of coffee a day. I've never been someone who is overly sensitive to caffeine but that level made me sick. On the other hand it also made me loose 3 lbs of water weight on that first day also which I can't be that grumpy about. I've only been taking it for a few days so I have no comment on long term use and result yet. Just word to the wise take that caffeine level into account if you take this product.
1,Nothing worth reading about!,I expected a lot more! Old info and really nothing new. Wanted to promote using a financial advisor which means you lose 1% automatically.
3,Living it Up without Outliving Your Money,"The book is Very Good. However, I received a 2005 edition. The current edition is 2008. The later is edition has research that is more current. I returned the book and kept the new one I had purchased at B & N."
4,Interesting book,"The book is to-the-point, it answered some of the questions that I had, it is a quick read for an adult. I recommend it for children."
4,Thoughtful information on Mary visions & sightings.,"This DVD started slow when setting the stage/background on the subject of religious sightings of Mother Mary. However, the remainder of the film was worth the wait. I do not have a Catholic background and the information in this film was very helpful in how these events relate to sound biblical teachings and theology. This is an exellent film to have in your collection if you consider yourself a bible student."
5,Interesting Movie. Food for thought.,"This movie deals with Marian appearances on earth all over the world. It also talks about the end of days and who we should be worshiping. I'm Catholic and found that this movie left me with a lot of food for thought. It talks about the seerers of Fatima,Medegure(sp) and others that are happening all over the world. Statues ""crying"" oil and blood are shown. But in the latter half of the show, there is talk about Mary worship. I guess if you are a staunch Catholic, you would find it offensive. But I viewed it with an open mind and found it thought provoking. The movie uses the bible as their bases of worship. I guess what makes me think a lot about this film is their coverage of the prayers Catholic say to Mary..... These prayers are prayers I learned as a young child and never really thought about it. It talked about both sides of this issue."
3,A proselytizing video,This video although having some good content is actually a means to stir people away from the Catholic Faith through inconsistencies and half truths.
1,It was the worst piece of junk I have ever started through,"I didn't come to this film with any knowledge of what it was about, but the further I tried to watch it, the worse it became. I do not recommend this film to anyone."
3,Starts off slow...,"This is a good video overall; it gets the point across. However, it starts off very slow.The setting in the beginning is dark and creepy looking.The UFO sightings near the beginning, makes it seems as though the topic is about typical science fiction alien encounters.Has too many interviews ""thrown in"" at different spots.Seemed like producers/writers weren't sure if they wanted a documentary or a discussion panel.Could have been better."
1,Hateful and extremely biased...,This film is completely biased and slanted towards the view point that many extreme protestants seem to hold; that Catholics actually worship Mary as if she were God. This is both offensive and untrue but also bigoted. If you hate Catholics or simply wish to remain misinformed than this is a movie for you. However if you are searching for a balanced and informative documentary regarding the sitings of Mary you should definitely look elsewhere because all you will get if you watch this film is one closed minded point of view; those much like a Chick pamphlet.
1,completely misleading and deceptive,the trailer to this video is very deceptive. DO NOT BE FOOLED...this is a smear campaign and outright attack on the Catholic church.
1,The moon under her feet,"Very misleading. The Roman Church deems Mary ""Mother of the Church"", who is Christ. ""Woman behold your son""; we, Humanity, are her children and she is our Queen. She is the greatest saint. A sourse to her Son. Christ said, ""whom ever praise my mother, praises me."""
4,This approach does work for me,I am now listening to it all the time in trains and buses. I do pick up kindergarten level german thanks to it.
2,German,It doesn't come with anything in writing. It would be nice to hace a list of most common phrases for use when travelling.
1,Pimsleur German CD's,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the product as 3 of the 15 CD's are missing! I contacted the merchant over 1 month ago but, to date, have not received a response. Please advise.Sincerely,Lorraine M. Harwelik"
2,Wrong paint.,"I received yellow paint instead of silver. The paint quality seems great didn't use it because I hate yellow. I'm sure it was a more rare mistake, but hands off to amazon they gave me a refund."
5,underrated art,"This cd is an amazing example of the broad spectrum of EDM and the breaks genre. As the title suggests, the cd is an atmospheric breaks mix. It contains classic tracks which are mixed flawlessly by Fortier. He flows fluidly from track to track from beginning to end while keeping a healthy pace throughout the cd. It's unfortunate that Fortier drifted back into trance after this album because Atmospheric Breaks is a brillant cd that helps broaden the scope of breakbeat. If you enjoy trance or the trancier side of breaks, purchase this cd."
3,I must be spoiled,"I thought the album was so so. I was recently introduced to techno and break beats back in June after an incredible experience at Club Utopia in Vegas, where Simply Jeff was the dj. Since then, I've purchased both Simply Jeff CDs, which are great. I've been trying to get my hands on a comparable break beat album by other artists, but haven't had any luck. Are my expectations too high now? I welcome any suggestions."
4,Mavis Beacon,"It's a good introduction. I ordered it because it's instruction was in Spanish, but was disappointed when all of the courses use english vocabulary and verbal instruction. Other than that, it's a good way to learn to type."
1,Not XP compatiable,"Software locked-up Windows XP. On the Broderbund support site the company explains that the software was written for an older version of Windows and is not XP compatiable. They list procedures that may allow the software to work if running under the compatability mode. However, the box says the software was written for XP. If Broderbund's packaging labels on this product are misleading then what about their other products.If you are running XP use something else."
1,Poor design,"Clearly, Broderbund always sinks their budget into marketing, not software development. What do you end up with? Vaporware.Do not pay over $19 and it should be worth the money."
1,Another piece of software hijacking my computer,"This program hijacked my computer. On start-up, it opens multiple windows, including an internet connection and registration window (despite my having already registered). I feel like I paid for a virus program.The logical follow-up was to contact Broderbund tech support at the e-mail address provided. There was an automatic reply that gave a general response (as in generally dismissive) to my query and stated I would not get any further reply. This was extremely frustrating.I purchased the program for my wife, who is not a power user on the computer. She likes the typing program, however, the start-up issues are difficult to get around. I am going to attempt to re-install it and hope for an improvement."
3,Mavis Beacon on Mac OS X,"I originally used Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 8 on a PC Windows 98. Loved it. This was back when MB was with Mind Spring. Simply Flawless.Now with Broderbund as MB Teaches Typing Deluxe 16 on an iMac G5 running OS X is a so so product for graphics. Actually pooh, pooh.It works OK as a typing teaching tool. I recently got to a lesson and got a fatal error requiring me to Force Quit the program and start over. It went back to the same lesson and required another Force Quit.Broderbund's website doesn't have any support. No updates for the S/W.So, would I buy this again. Yeah, cause this is all that I know for teaching typing. If you can buy this for around $10ish plus shipping and handling like I did then OK."
5,Mine worked on XP SP2 perfectly.,"I was surprised to hear that this software didn't work on others' computers that were running XP SP2, mine runs just fine. To be honest though it did take a while for the setup to kick in. After it started up the first time though it runs flawlessly.During the exersizes(sp) there is a little keyboard on the screen with see-through hands telling you which finger needs to go where. That really helped me out, being a visual learner.Graphics are very cheap looking, but you're not in this for a beauty contest, it's to improve your typing speed. This program really does just that."
1,Poor Software Design for the Mac OS X,MB Deluxe 16 will only run under an administrator user account. Borderlund should not be selling this product for OS X until they correct this problem.
3,"Story good, Illistrations not so","I like Dragons so I took a chance on this one. I rated it a 3 because the story is good, easy to read, however I think that for the price and size the illistrations could have been more in depth and more colored ones. Black and white sketches really aren't what most people expect to find in a book like this and most of the colored ones are rather modernized and to me uninteresting instead of actual dragons doing things that go with the story."
2,"Nice attempt, but not ready for prime time","I bought this toaster because of its ability to handle both thick and thin slices of toast. It actually does this quite well. Bagel slices, bread, even pita bread toasts nicely. It has an orange backlit LCD that counts down the seconds until the toast is done. However, I had to bring back the 1st Avanta Elite because the LCD did not work. (It seemed like there was a loose connection in the lighted LCD). The replacement Avante Elite worked fine for about a month, and then the handle just broke right off. Nice attempt at a toaster, but has a few things that need to be improved."
1,It is a piece of poo - especially for the price,"I had it for a few months and the handle that lowers the toast snapped right off, and I see I'm not the only one who had that happen to. Very disappointing. And don't even think about checking out the T-Fal warranty."
3,"Nice looking, fast toast","I bought this because it toasts fast and looks great on a counter with stainless steel appliances. It has worked for 5 years or so, but it is not real even in it's toasting."
4,"nice, but get Honorary Citizen instead","This collection is a very nice overview of Tosh's 80's output and well worth looking into if this period of his music is all you are interested in.Most of these songs can be had on the much superior ""Honorary Citizen"" box set and includes more Wailers and famous solo tracks than this cd provides."
1,"Junk, do not buy","This coffee maker is pretty useless. It makes a pathetic, loud noise when its running and takes a long time to make a cup of coffee. Its so bad that I would consider it non-functional. Unfortunately we didn't open the box and use it for quite a while after we bought it so now I can't even send it back. We are just going to throw it away."
5,stunning,"Hundred Reasons prove exactly why England is a great place to be right now in terms of music. Combining the passion and drive of bands like Grade and Will Haven with the sensibilities of Weezer and Pearl Jam, Hundred Reasons will have you desperate for more.And that is the only flaw with this EP - you want more from them so badly that it hurts. However, the wait will soon be over and their second EP will be here soon.Definitely worth a listen. They're gonna be massive VERY soon."
5,A Surprise Album,"In my opinion, I think this current album Illumination sounds great both musically and lyrics. Much of the work sounds very different from their previous albums. One thing I really noticed a lot was there weren't anyone singing with extreme vocals, which in a way is good since sometimes you need to hear more the main vocalists than there guest vocalist. Favorite song out of the album Down and Ab Initio, Vebeke's vocals are really beautiful in those songs."
4,Goth,"This album has a very atmospheric feel, and a couple of songs have an almost religious feel to them. The vocals soar with grace."
5,Tristania: Illumination,awesome seller. item arrived very quickly and as promised. A++++++ seller. Would highly recommend them. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again!
3,The days of glory are over...,"Tristania was highly unique because of the epic tones of their songs, the glorious melodies that were both enchanting and sublime. Those are definitely absent here(in fact the charm left the band when Morten Veland left). Unfortunately the glory is now missing not only here, but also in the new Morten's band's latest album ""Nine destinies and a downfall"".If you are after the real thing and have never listened to either Tristania or Sirenia, go with their earlier albums, like ""Tristania"", ""Beyond the veil"", ""AT sixes and sevens"", etc. and you'll see the difference."
5,One of the best I've read,"I first learned of the book a couple of years ago in NZ. It had been on someone's recommended reading list and a couple of my fellow travelers had started it. Picked it up a while back and was unable to put it down. I can see how people either love it or hate it. Taken literally, it is difficult to like. People who drink that much in real life just aren't very interesting. The child abuse scenes are disturbing, though not as horrific as some of the works of Jerzy Kosinsky that I used to be enamored with. Further, if you've been in NZ, you'll know that the people there are among the nicest you'll ever meet. After a few pages, however, the style just pulls you in on an emotional and fantastic trip around the psyche. Definitely well worth the effort."
1,A book that somehow makes excuses for child abuse.,"Try as I may, I have to admit that I stopped after one of Simon's more horrific beatings. The subject matter of this book is difficult, but that is not the problem. The problem lies in the fact that the author attempts to legitimatize child abuse. As the mother of a 5 year old, parts of this book are unbearable. If I want to read about child abuse, I'll look in the newspaper. However, I must admit that the author has a splendid writing style, and I understand that there is much more to see in this book than child abuse but it is overshadowed. This book certainly distressed me; I just think the same story could have been told without the torture of a child."
3,Left empty and confused,"Blech! It's as though Keri Hulme transcribed a hazily remembered dream/nightmare. So much was utterly foreign and the author was no help at all, so concerned with melding prose and poetry (I found flipping back and forth for translations maddening, as well). In the end I just guessed at what was going on and had to conclude that the story lines were meant to be unclear because no amount of re-reading helped.The characters were not much better, mainly because they were such mysteries. An author's job is to illuminate and Keri Hulme used a guttering birthday candle for this midnight-dark book."
2,"Ok, but ultimately unsatisfying","I found this book periodically enjoyable, periodically dull. The main flaw is the main character, who appears to a fantasized version of the author (note the similarity in names)."
2,Overrated and overwritten,"I didn't like this book much. I tried to work up some enthusiasm, but could not. The author giving the main character a very similar name to her own grated on my nerves. The central problem with the book is that far too much time is spent on long, meandering expositions on the characters' inner lives and the contents of their heads, as well as endlessly repetitive incidents in their lives - having drinks, the kid stealing, the terrible poems she inserts, etc. At LEAST 100 pages could've been cut. I never felt much affection for any of the characters, either, even if I felt sorry for them. The wordy expositions did not deepen the characters, they were also as repetitive as the scenes. I'm really amazed this won the Booker Prize. I almost quit in the middle, around page 200 where it REALLY bogs down, but I have a goal of reading as many Booker Prize winners and nominees as possible and I didn't want to fall short of doing that."
1,less than one,"I'd like to add a p.s. to the note I sent off earlier this evening.To the puzzled reader in Australia: The money that goes with the Booker prize is welcome to authors, but the award itself is meaningless. The winners of some prizes like the NBA are determined by taking a poll of other experienced writers or critics. I've been told that the winner of the annual Booker prize is determined by one man with a great deal of money and no apparent literary qualifications. If we were rich enough, we could establish our own Booker Prizes. The prize has been given to some outstanding books--and to some incredibly awful ones."
1,Poorly executed!,This book could have been good. The possibilities were simply lost in the hands of an immature writer. Keri Hulme used a writing style that simply did not allow for the characters to develop into people I could care about. The sentence structure did not imply mysticism at all;this writer was sorely in need of several writing classes before submitting this disappointing piece. Don't waste your time on this!
5,one of the most magical streams of creativity I've ever read,"Hulme writes fluidly, beautifully. She chooses her language with precision, and each word adds to the magic of the story of these three unfortunate people. Kere, Joe and Simon are, for all their faults, characters easily sympathised with, which I think comes from Hulme's empathy as a writer. Each personality is well-developed in itself, and the three come together almost as three aspects of a single person. This makes it easy to relate to all of the characters, and captivating to study their interaction. The best thing about the novel, in my opinion, is its fluidity and spontaneity of narration. My attention was never lost, and I read as much in one sitting as I could. It was also incredible to taste the words Hulme uses, and linger on the poetry she has created from language. The book's one drawback, however, is that it's written in the present tense, which sometimes makes it difficult for readers to concentrate"
5,This book haunts me in the best way.,"Extremely rich, deep and dark and fulfilling. The style is, for me, reminiscent of Kesey (one of my all-time favorite authors), lots of shifts in perspectives, jumps in time, and yet always clear and narrative. But this story is so far beyond style. It's violent and beautiful, full of the deepest contradictions that make us human. I've never read a clearer depiction of how love and violence and need can be so wrapped up together. And I was far from disappointed by the ending. The 'redemption' of Kerewin and Joe mirrors my own personal experience - one has to let go, all the way, even unto death, in order to begin living fully. The journey rings true for me, even if their transcendence is perhaps too 'magical' for belief. But I love the magic, too. In following this book down such dark paths, I was grateful to have light shining at the end, a hope, a faith that transcendence is possible. Thank you, Keri, for this marvelous work. You inspire."
4,Simple note of thanks,"This review will be short; I just wanted to thank you, Ms Hulme, for a terrific book. It makes me so happy when I know there's nothing else I'd rather do in the world than finish the book I'm reading."
5,rich and wonderful writing,"I laughed at the reviewer (below) who said this was written by someone who had read too much Tolkien. I didn't like Tolkien, but I loved this novel and so did my whole book group (all women). We all loved the first part of the book and felt as if the author had phoned in the ending, which was disappointing, but I wouldn't not recommend it because of the ending. We started to compare our images of her wonderful house (all of us wanted to live there) and our images were totally different. I wouldn't go to court to support the author for her plot, but the relationships between the characters held me glued to the book anyway. This is a book in which the author rose above her own flaws. Well above ordinary writing."
2,Meh.,"Great literacy is about taking chances. You may love this book.Surely, the discourse was presented excellently.As for myself, I was excruciatingly bored and left feeling rather tentative about the time I put into this book."
2,rapid descent into New Age gibberish,"I feel compelled to rescue any readers from the misleading plethora of 5 star ratings below. The first two thirds of this book are good (not great). The characters are intriguing, in part because of the exotic small town New Zealand locale, and the plot unfolds in a meandering pattern that leads the reader on while flirting with frustrating said reader.The last third of this book is absurdly bad in all senses. The plot becomes a ridiculous New-Age-tussle-with-cancer story. The style becomes a really horrible attempt at magic realism. The prose loses all discipline (and it never had much) and turns into some undergraduate writing seminar exercise in the use of the tangled metaphor coupled with the pointlessly histrionic use of adverbs and adjectives. Help! I only finished it because I'm stubborn. That this book won any kind of prize is a crime."
2,Pages falling out,"Literally, every other page falls out of the book. We ordered it for a school project and have had to buy a new book locally so it can be finished. Disappointing quality."
2,Difficult to read,"This was an extremely difficult book to read. It is long, the font (in the copy I had) was small, and the writing style was unique, but hard to follow. I got the basic gist of the story, but I'm sure I missed a lot of what the author was trying to convey."
3,A poorly edited book can be the bane of one's reading existence. A tightly edited book can be the meaning of one's existence.,"There's no questions that Keri Hulme's writing style is poetically masterful. There's also no doubt that The Bone People sheds interesting light on the Maori people and their traditions. Yet all the masterful word-weaving and cultural enlightenment in the world can't save a story that is so light-handedly edited that it loses its readers. Therein lies the problem with this novel. An ending that could have proven magical and unforgettable left me utterly puzzled and disappointed (even irritated) that I had put forth the concentrated effort it took to reach the final pages. Unfortunately, the plot enticements that go nowhere, which other reviewers have pointed out, glaring serve as yet another example of this book's flaws. My average rating is for a mixed bag of tricks, which is precisely what you'll get if you're patient enough to reach the epilogue of The Bone People."
1,Not for everybody and definitely not for me,"Apparently, many people enjoyed this book, including the majority of my book group. But I agree with the 3 publishers who, Keri Hulme explains in the preface to the first edition, rejected this book. This is a difficult, unpolished, often incomprehensible book. Perhaps as fair warning, Hulme provides what she calls ""an explanatory dream."" What this dream explains never becomes any clearer than most of the book itself. I can't deny that there were parts of this book that I enjoyed, but there were parts of the books that were simply maddening. In the end, I decided that the negatives far outweighed the positives of this book."
5,Mesmerizing!,"Perhaps I shouldn't even try to write a comment because it's difficult to put into words why I was so moved by and what I loved about this book. The writing, descriptions, and character development were so incredibly beautiful. I knew these characters. I admired, hated, felt compassion for, and rooted for them. The three main characters were complex and destined for an intertwined emotional journey that would have to completely shatter them before they could possibly heal. I can't say this book is for everyone and can't say who I would recommend it to because it contains some brutal scenes on the harsh topic of child abuse. But, I've never read anything quite like it and feel something special for these characters. I wish I could explain it but I know that I will definitely reread this book in my lifetime."
5,What More Can I Say?,"I hate to add just one more voice to the chorus of praise here (I almost wish I could rate the book a 5 just to add variety to all the 10's and the few 1's here), but this book is fascinating. It's like a long, strange dream captured on paper, full of semi-darkness, strange characters and settings, and twisted stories that all make sense in the context of the book's world. A stone tower by the sea where a solitary woman lives, a mysterious mute child washed out of the sea, a brutal yet loving adoptive father--all meet to create a story that blends dark and light, bitter and sweetness, a sense of fairy tale mixed with ugly, brutal reality. An interesting read that you won't soon (if ever) forget!"
3,The Bone People,"Kerein, Joe and Simon are the stars of The Bone People. The Maori tradition and way of life in New Zealand is slowpaced. As an individual it is difficult to assume this lifestyle by Kerein. She lives in a dream world of ""what could be."" She doesn't allow herself to feel love. Joe and Simon jumpstart her life in forming a family triangle of love and pain, including abuse. The Maoiri way of life is close knit. Yet the love for life beats against the wind in hopes of finding something tangible and real. The beauty of this island is reflected in Hulme's description. The elements also star in this book, the wind, rain and ocean. Hulme's still small voice intercedes throughout the book constantly engaging in what could be. The beauty in word and form engulf the reader. I did not like the ending,it appears all three have died. I did enjoy how Kerein was renewed from her illness to paint and become a person once again."
5,The Bone People,"Thought provoking work on the strength of women, the ravages of alcohol and child abuse and the strength of family. Set in New Zeland."
3,"Intriguing, but too long","The story line about the clash of cultures, and the relationships between various types of people made an excellent book. The story line really has potential. However, I feel it was a bit too long, and the middle seemed to drag. It was somewhat unpredictable, which makes a story good. The conclusion added more thought, and did not just close off cheaply like many other books I have read. A book is a book... go ahead and try it!"
4,"brilliant, totally captivating",A fantastic novel that starts a little slowly however soon has the reader captivated. I could not put this book down and the complex relationships between the characters keeps the reader enthralled.
4,Great combination book,"I had to brush up on my algebra and trig so I ordered a book of amazon. I never had it in school but i wish i did, it would have made things so much easier. Starts out with R chapters being really basic then slowly advances till you are really for precalc. If you are a student in need of a decent reference book for either or both of the subjects listed this is definitely a good one."
5,great purchase,this used book doesn't look used at all. this book has no mark and very clean and gently used. i wish they have more books based on school specific collection.
3,Change of pace for Smiley,"I believe this is Smiley's first attempt at mystery/suspense.It's not bad, although after the initial discovery of two bodies by the librarian protagonist the plot seems to grind to a halt for a while and we get (for me) too many details of shopping trips, food preparation and meals eaten at the expense of the story. There is however some smart dialogue and a good feel for the New York location. We rather clumsily learn the identity of the murderer quite early in the book but the action does pick up after that point and there are some genuine moments of suspense."
2,A Disappointment from a Gifted Author,"I like Jane Smily. I like her a lot. That is why I was so surprised not to like Duplicate Keys. The book had my interest at the beginning and developed the lead character Alice Ellis quite well. The idea of a close knit group of friends falling apart and away from each other as some of them grew up was fascinating, particulary as two of them have been shot dead at the beginning of the book. The mystery element is early on through out, though, as it becomes obvious who it is and the book descends to a sort of psychobabble for the resoltion that is beneath the subtle display of human motives that the author manipulated beautifully in A Thousand Acres. This book is an early one for author as she develops her wonderful style and it feels incomplete. But if this is the phase she had to move through to provide the wonderful later, then it was worth it."
4,An enjoyable read,"In Duplicate Keys, Jane Smiley weaves an interesting web offriendship gone awry and the resulting murder that takesplace. The characters are well developed and Smiley doesn'tgive too much away until the end. The story holds thereader's attention and I enjoyed Smiley's writng style. Theending was somewhat predictable but not entirely obvious.I would defnitely read other books by Smiley."
2,Terribly Dissapointing,"The murder happens before the story opens. You never get to know the people that are dead except through the rememberances of the other characters. This doesn't provide for a very sympathetic audience. You really don't care who the killer is.The main character, Alice, is very pathetic. During the entire novel, she treats everyone fabulously well except for the one person sho is actually being nice to her, Henry.If this is a picture of realism, that reality is terriby sad."
1,too bulky,"First off, this brand is much harder to install on the buttstock than the MidwayUSA brand. The other thing that I don't like on this is the flap. It seemed like a good idea, but once installed I realized that the flap is much to big. It either goes way past the velcro, or you can line up the velcro and have a huge floppy cover which gets in the way a lot. I would buy a different brand."
3,I like this product and dislike it at the same time,I gave it an ok rating cause I'm gonna use it but ill get to that in a second first off the bad it's completely unadjustable and because of that you have to put in one place on your stock so for different shooters its not easy to reach the rounds I use different grains from 165 to 180 and I base it on my cold bore shot so I usually change my first round also the velcro flap isn't adjustable so it kinda hangs loosely but if you have some extra self adhisive Velcro that you. Get at Walmart to can fix that I like the round covering flap also is a pain to get it on the back of your butt stock and have to cut your own hole for the slick knob other than it looks nice it came on time I put it on upside down cause walking with it on the other way the round flap kept catching on my pack its a good product for that person that costomizes there gear to work for them and for those not trying to empty there wallet
2,Sucks but useable.,This buttstock shell holder needs to be tighter/smaller because it slips and needs to come in different camo patterns. Or they can add a strap to it like the M4/M16 buttstock mag holders. If it were designed like those and with a cheek pad it would be perfect. You can always spray paint it and tape what you can to the stock to keep it in place though. Itches your face but you will get over it. Definitely needs to have a cheek pad sewn on to it. I do like the fact that you can cover your shells with the flap. Nice touch. Holds 6 rounds pretty good.
5,Mas de 30 años despues... aun toca profundo,"La musica de Silvio no envejece. El ejemplo perfecto es este album. Grabado en 1975, mas de 20 annos despues, retiene la misma frescura y candor de entonces. El album reune temas increibles, como es el caso de ""Suenno con Serpientes"" (versionada por numerosos artistas), ""Pequenna Serenata Diurna"", ""Yo Digo Que Las Estrellas"" y la cancion que le da nombre al album, todas autenticos himnos de la Trova Cubana y las generaciones que han aprendido a amar esta musica.Es dificil otorgarle el titulo de mejor album de Silvio, no porque no sea genial, sino porque Silvio tiene decenas de canciones inolvidables desperdigadas a lo largo y ancho de su profusa discografia. Entonces, siendo el album inicial de Silvio, lo dejaremos como un album que marco pauta en su momento, hace mas de 30 annos y hoy en dia sigue teniendo vigencia a nivel lirico y musical."
1,Needs a better picture and clearer description.,"The photo shows a mic and mount. That's misleading. If what's being sold is only the mount then you need to show a picture of the mount only. I read the description as ""Audio Technica Unimount Microphone--Instrument Mount"" which I assumed meant ""Instrument-mounted Microphone."""
4,"pretty cool,","My focus was for a acoustic guitar I have and it took some time to get to do what i needed, I did end up with it in the guitar typically I like mic guitars from the outside but I get a nice sound. I used it on horns, Sax's and clarinets and works great. If I were to need to purchase another for guitar I would look around a little for a longer stem."
5,One of my favorite guitars to play,You can not beat this guitar for the money. Mine smokes. Great sound and great action. I added the Bigsby tremolo. I also have a Gibson Les Paul Studio which is also a fantastic guitar but to be honest the difference in playability and sound is not worth spending $300+ more. BnB Beatles Depot
4,Epiphone Les Paul!,"I love this guitar. Sounds great, looks great, feels great. simple as that. I would have given it a 5 star review, however the high e string came broken."
1,Buy the real thing,Just save your money and buy a Ephiphone Les Paul Standard or buy a Gibson... I have a Gibson Les Paul Standard and this guitar... True it plays the same as the Standard but sounds no where near as good... tone is flat...sustain is bad...
4,Affordable,"If you want a decent electric guitar, specially if you want a LP, and dont have the kind of money for a Standard or +, this is the one for you.Sounds decent and looks good. Fast shipping.Problems: Came with E string broken, had to replace it. The strings seem to be a little bit too low, causes buzz when strummed (string(s) hit fret(s)). Adjustable."
2,The headphone jack is too small.,You can't use regular headphones on this thing unless you find an adapter to go from the normal size to something smaller. I'll be returning this.
3,Good but not as the first.,"This CD was a big dissapointment for all the Loc's aout there. The first CD was way better. The good songs in this CD is probably ""C.s in tha air"", ""Payin' dues"" and maybe one more. Its all good though."
1,i herd diss albume but aint never got it,its no good yall i wish i could of gave it no stars but this rating system said u had to give it a 1 threw 5 i gave it 100 spokes down im out
4,Great External DVD-Rom for the price.,Would be better if it connects through UBS. The PCMCIA card is a bit cluncky.
5,Great protection,It's a perfect fit for the coil. Very easy to snap on and take off. Very happy with my purchase.
3,Varible Pricing,"This tank is an example of one of the few times I found an Amazon listed product more expensive than local drive to point of purchase. I bought the same tank for $289, far below the $500+ listed price on Amazon. Amazon is a great source for my intial research and very often purchase point for what all I seek. Amazon buyer reviews have been more helpful than Consumer Reports. I also very much appreciate that I do not get spam mail using fake Amazon messages like I do from paypal and ebay. Keep up the fine organization!"
1,Awful Movie,"I can't believe I wasted all that time on a movie that was not worthwhile. The storyline is BORING. It's predictable and drags on and on and on. As far as the action goes, it's a disappointment, compared to the other recent Donnie Yen movies. Only reason I watched this is for him, since they put his name on the top of the casting list but he only plays a relatively minor role in the movie. Not recommended. Don't waste your time."
2,B&A,"There was not enough action in it,not like the rest of Donnie Yen,like in the Ip man movies,those were more fight scenes."
1,Another piece of Chinese communist propaganda,It seems the Chinese revolution will never cease to be glorified. They keep talking about the end of poverty and hunger as if they're trying to convince us it worked. As for the movie itself it was overly dramatic with poorly choreographed fight scenes. The cinematography was just as bad. I'm a Donnie Yen fan but this was a drag.
1,Awful,The amount of combat in the film is low and poor action sequences. I found the film very boring. Spoiler- They have a Yao Ming size Chinese guy and spend an inordinate amount of time showing him stomping around and he has ZERO martial arts ability DUMB DUMB DUMB film.DO not Rent.
3,Bodyguards and Assassins,"I ordered this dvd but did not keep it. It is in Chinese with English subtitles, so I can not give you a review."
5,Great Information,Very informative for those contemplating writing a childrens book. I am sure I will refer back to this book many times in the next couple of years. Easy to follow based on topic.
5,Great information. Well presented. Inspiring!,"I realized that my kids have some of Lisa Rojany Buccieri's childrens books and we always enjoy reading them (plus I have a secret wish to write my own), so I thought I'd give this a try. It's clear and to the point with very solid advice. I was especially pleased that it combined great info on marketing/publishing/business with guidance on writing creativity. I was glad to find a book that helped me focus on how to put my ideas to work on paper."
4,Helpful and Motivating,If you know nothing about the publishing industry - and I didn't - then this book is very informative. There were some very useful details regarding what publishers are looking for and initial coaching on how to write your story. The book was optimistic and motivational without leading you to believe that writing a children's story is easy.
5,Best Basic Guide,"This really does start from square one and explain the process of writing for children. It isn't overwhelming at all, very user-friendly, unlike other writing-reference books I've picked up."
5,Extensive guide,This is a great guide and study for anyone that is interested in writing children's books. Very extensive and covers any question you would ever have. If you are going to write for young adult or children I do say this book would greatly help you plan your path.
5,Great guide for ARTISTA wanting to write books!,"I LOVED this book!Having published other 18 books as an illustrator, I found this book to be a fantastic source of reference and guidance to people who like me want to develop and expand on their knowledge about creating great books, and learning the business of the publishing.The section on illustrating books is also very accurate and straight forward. As an illustrator, I appreciated learning about other artists experiences and processes.Thank you for such a great tool! Look forward to more books about the subject."
4,"Very good, but missing something...",I felt that this book would've been five stars if it had included a few illustrations as well as some additional exercises for aspiring writers.
3,Did Not Exceed Expectations,"I was not as impressed with this book as I had hoped to have been. There just wasn't enough insightful information about the creative process. Most of what was in this book were suggestions that I already knew, so it's definitely not for a more well-rounded writer. I guess it really is just for beginners."
4,Decent quality but use loc-tite,This scope mount is decent quality for the money but when you assemble this use the blue (removable) loc-tite. After a few shots without it will loosen and send the rounds to who knows where! Other than that it will do the job. Maybe a little loc-tite in the box and a small note would work...
1,Didn't fit my mini 14,"I had the same problem as the previous reviewer, the part simply didn't fit and I had to grind off a little of the metal in order to make it slide in. I kind of thought it was a ruger factory part too until I got it."
2,bad,"we mounted it and the mounting screw hit the bolt, not a very good design, think of something else next time"
1,Worthless.,"This unit is worthless. The one point mount will not tighten without extra washers, and even then will rock 2 or 3 degrees up and down elevation. Required gunsmith machining expense to mount the replacement bolt stop cover plate, which does not come close to being same tolerances as stock Ruger part, and even then does not work because of design flaw. Ridiculously incompetent design. Total waste of time and money."
2,cheap,"its cheap and kept coming loose, wouldn't recommend this brand at all. If I still had the rifle I would try another brand, but sold it."
2,A little simplistic and not very interesting,"The author goes to some trouble to demonstrate Anglicanism's dependence on Lutheran thought for its Articles and Catechism and other documents, but he is not as thorough or scholarly as I would have liked. It seems that Lutheranism's influence on Anglicanism waxed and waned in the 1500s and then disappeared almost entirely in the 1600s."
3,Once upon a time..........,This movie is a good example of how fishing for tuna was done in South Australia. Nowadays the tuna is held in floating pens off the coast. This film can be slow in places but if you are interested in the old style of fishing with steel sqid jigs then you might enjoy it. More of a rent for the night film.
3,hmmm,"I don't understand how anyone could give this cd 5 stars. I would admit that there are a few songs on this album that are good. I like Tamara is a punk, Today I fell in love, and the sappy the Sun always shines around you. Ok, so that's not the only sappy song here. But most of these songs are throwaways. It used to be the short songs that seemed like Queers throwaways would end up being the songs you listened to years later. That's not the case anymore. But hey, this is loads better than their next album..."
5,THESE GUYS ROCK!,"I love these guys, they all grew up and made it from my hometown which kicks ass! They are the epitome of old school, ass kickin punk rock.CHECK IT OUT!"
5,good stuff,"I bought the vinyl of this album (which makes it even cooler) and I gotta say that every song on this CD is awsome. They are really into loving things, which is a bit of change from their earlier work (check out their other album ""Day Late and a Dollar Short""). I was surprised by the depth of the vocals and harmonies, very cool. One warning, you probably don't want to blast this CD with your parents in the same room Cheers"
1,CASH MONEY to the RESCUE!!!!!,"The tear da club up thugs music all sounds the same you betta' be lucky you put the cash money brother's (Juvenile, B.G., annd the HOT BOYS)on there or you wouldn't have sold half as many copies as you did CASH MONEY to the RESCUE!!!!!"
1,HA HA!,"The way some of you ""G""s write makes me laugh, you're almost as ridiculus as this pile. Its junk, and what's more its been done 50 million times before and since. Can't you pretentious fools see that? Wel neva min coz am gona go tu da pub na so aite wiggas"
2,TDCUT Love Their Mommies,"It is really touching to see these funny little boys play at being men. Kind of like watching your 5-year-old nephew tie a tablecloth around his neck and run around pretending to be Batman. The fantasies these silly billies spin out in their lyrics are just more sexualized versions of the 5-year-old's ""Vrrrrooom, Vrrrrooom"" fantasy role-playing. It is SO DAMN CUTE! But at heart these little ""badass mofos"" love their mommies and just want to be cuddled when they feel hurt. Many of these macho-man rappers, it is well known, also seek solace from other men, REAL MEN who can handle the world and know how it works. But since it would be a shame to spoil these little fellas' fantasies of omnipotence (which springs from their impotence), I can't bring myself to give it less than two stars. That would be like taking candy from a baby...and that's just not nice!"
4,The Sh.....,"It made me a Three 6 mafia fan. There beats and bass is fresh(havnt used that word in years). Too $hort,twister, Crucial Conflict, fatal, Spice, more... Makes this album Dope(that word too)."
5,you should already know,"man to keep it short n simple this cd as well as all tha otha 666 mafia cd's are tha best so don't hate......they should get 50,000 stars but this thang won't let me rate them so high....holla @ cha dude and get @ meh..."
5,This Cd Is the bomb,This cd is the best one ever from triple six and ii think their next cd which is when the smoke clears or sumthin like that is gonna be badass like this one
4,Triple Sixxx,"This is a great album to get you hyped. The production is bangin and dj paul and juicy j kill it. just listen to it and you dont get excited, somethin is wrong. it is a great follow up for the ""chapter 2: world domination"" album. it gives the fan a good 3-6 fixrating A-"
4,Tear da club thugs,If you like three six mafia's world domination then you'll like this album. The beats are tight and when Twista was flowing on one of the songs I thought that was the dopest. Push'em off is hella tight for like bumpin in your car. This isn't for you hip-hop heads but you gotta give them credit for coming up with some sick music.
5,Great way to hear Gina again!,"The album as a whole is good, what really sold me is Gina G. being on one of the lead singers...The best song by far is Keep Love Together, but original and remix. The other songs are good, in particular Venus, which is an altogether proper selection giving this is an all girl quartet. As far as purchase Mp3 is the way to go as $18.00+ is a little steep, but if you have to its still worth the $$$ as the music will keep everyone going well past the price."
1,no!,"soo..terrible...do not buy. i'm still in shock. it reminds me of that stupid comedy movie where they use that 80's themesong for those 2 guys from Saturday Night Live, with the head-shaking? I guess anyone really can get on a record and who knows what their voices even sound like under all that techno and effects."
1,Incredible waste of time,"This movie may have raised erotic feelings in me when I was twelve years old, but at sixty-two, it raised nothing. Mira Sorvino is one of my favorites, but even her presence could not help elevate these juvenile stories to a level worth watching.If you do decide to watch this movie, at least sit at your piano and practice Beethoven while watching, that way you will not be totally wasting your time."
4,Wondeful Fren Experience!,"This is an extremlr good Cd, definetly the french touch in the lyrics gives it a touch of class, and the rythim is great too. You Must Buy This!"
2,OK for mechanical - useless for electrical,"This manual tries to cover far too many years of this model to be effective. In fact, this should really be broken into two seperate manuals ('93-'98, and '99-'04). For most of the mechanical sections they manage to cover the full range by including doubles of all the pictures, one set for the older models and one set for the newer models. This can get confusing at times, but can be managed. Where this book comeplety falls apart is in the electrical chapter. The information and schematics included ONLY apply to the older, pre-'99 style Grand Cherokees and are completely worthless for newer models. If you have a '93-'98 Grand then this book should be great for you, I'd give it 4 stars, but for folks like me with the newer models then it is barely 1 star."
1,To Generic for the job,"I bought this book to fix a leaking water pump. What I found was a lack of detail put forth for specific tasks. Instead of referencing a specific illustration, they just say, ""see illustration"" but don't tell you which one of the many on the page to reference. I have been completely thrilled with other Hayes books in the past, but it seems that the need to put a single book out to cover a larger population has hurt their ability to provide a quality book that is usable."
1,Not enough information to do anything.,"If this is the best there is, we are in trouble! The main problem is it covers too many years and does not concentrate on any one of them. I can get more specific information on the Internet. Don't waste your money."
3,Not enough info,"The book was helpful but It lacked detail. I got it to help with changing out the A/C Evaporator and heater core, with the hardest part being the removal of the dash. Some of the steps were wrong as well as the locations of the fasteners holding it in place. Would not recommend this to any novice DIYer trying to take on a big job or detailed task. I was luck that I have done Major repairs before and had the know-how to to work through it."
3,93-00 Haynes Jeep Grand Cherokee Repair Manual,Decent manual with satisfactory information and a decent array of pictures to help with the repairs.Should include a section for the common issues since this was published in 00 and these Jeeps were known to have many various problems....This is good for basic repairs but doesn't meet the standards of a factory Manual.For the price you can't beat it and it's worth having on your shelf
5,RAGE,"This book was great, I would recommend it to any horror/suspense fan. It kept me interested from start to finish.You don't usually feel for the bad guy, but in this case you could not help it. I could have not been more impressed and I can't wait to get my hands on more of Steve's books.TexasChick"
4,Huck Finn on a river of blood? Definitely.,"Steve Gerlach writes horror stories with real characters, people you could meet in your own life. That's why his stories are so damn scary. You're guaranteed to have a good ride when you pick up a Gerlach."
1,"Pure, exploitative violent pornography","I must admit that this novel is well written, and builds at a nice pace. However, if you get to the final chapter (which is one of the most disgusting, revolting things you are likely to read in a mainstream novel), you will be left feeling filthy and in need of a shower. The violence in this book is just way too over the top, and in the wake of the Columbine tragedy, I believe is very irresponsible to release such a piece of fiction; any unbalanced teenager who reads this just might flip his lid. This thing is dangerous. I can't remember the last time I read a book and was this physically AND emotionally REPULSED."
1,"Trash From Yet Another ""Richard Laymon Wannabee!!!""","In this book the reader is introduced to a Major League Geek College student named Ben. Ben gets treated like dirt by the women he meets and he is tired of it.Poor guy.This guy has ""Serious Issues"" as they say on Oprah. Then THE RAGE starts to build up inside of him with predictable results. I give this book 1 star because it promised Horror and all it did was deliver disgusting scenes of gratuitous violence.If you can indentify with the Geek Protagonist in this book I strongly suggest you forget about applying for a Shooters Licence and seriously consider some Heavy Duty Medication and Therapy. One also has to wonder if this book should even be sold in bookstores after the tragic events that occurred at Columbine High School.It just might influence some 17 year old pencil necked High School Geek to finally realize his pathetic Revenge Fantasies.I threw this book in the trash can where it belongs."
4,"Cliche, but a Fast Read","There is a lot I loved about this book. Gerlach's writing style and storytelling ability are top notch. Rage was a real page turner for me, in a world where few books are.But with that said, Rage is not without flaws. The second half of the book feels very contrived. I almost felt like the author didn't know how to write a misfit, so he threw in all the standard cliches. That is the main flaw with the book...cliches. The protagonist is one big cliches after another.With that said, this is still a good read. No book is perfect."
5,Great album.,"With her hauntingly beautiful voice, unique melodies and rhythms, and her beautiful gift for metaphor, this is now one of my favorite folk albums."
3,great for situational vocab,i use this picture dictionary to tutor an ESL student with very little english skills. the pictures have number labels and at the bottom of the page is the vocal in spanish and english. it's easy to quiz by just covering up the vocab.what would be nice is if it had more adjectives rather than mostly nouns/verbs.
2,Not So Good...,"I bought one of these last summer, after using it a couple of dozen times I would like to make the following comments:Pros- stores in very small package, easy to transport, light weight, cost effectiveCons- takes a long time to inflate (including with electric pump), takes a long time to deflate (including with electric pump), poor directional stability when paddling, However, biggest issue by far is.... the boat seems to slowly take on water between in infalatble hull and outer skin, when the boat is removed from the water often several gallons of water are trapped between the two skin layers. The affect is to cause the boat to slowly sag in the middle to the point where you often find yourself paddling with water upto your waist."
3,Eh,"I could only get through a couple of the stories in this book. Each sentance was so long and convoluted that it became a turnoff to me. I've read a lot of short story fiction of this type, but this one wasn't that great."
3,cute,"I actually didn't really like this as much as i thought I would and I totally love EVERYTHING dolphin. I don't know if it was because the face is so big or the band was so ""cheap"". the band falls apart easily. I didn't get to wear it much."
4,fancy fancy,"This toaster arrived very quickly even with the super saver shipping, it appears to be durable, the programmable feature may be over kill but it gives a high tech flare to the device. Very pleased so far."
1,T-Fal Avanti Elite Toaster 4T Model 2,"Looks great, but not up to the expectation. Got the rusted product from Amazon, but thanks to the easy return service..Ramana"
3,buy something else,"This toaster has a nice bagel setting that toasts only the cut side of the bagel. The toasting is nice, though slow, if you don't mind waiting about three mnutes for your toast, you will be more than satisfied. The slot length is standard bread size and will not accommodate rye bread. The crumb tray is cheaply made, and out of the box, one of the crumb trays would not stay in, it was too much hassle to return the item on account of the crumb tray, though it is an annoyance..... P.S. the above review was written upon receipt of the toaster, after a few months of use I would give it a 1 star. The toaster is now permanently etched and marred where the lever does not clear the face of the toaster. It is SLOW. ... you could do much better than this poorly made toaster...PPS, this postscript is added after the toaster ejected my toast and sent it flying across the counter onto the floor. True story. I am going to junk it and buy another toaster."
4,Nxzen 5000 Bluetooth Headset,The noise reduction feature is very effective. Only downside is that the unit is a little big ...
1,stay with a name you know,I went for the most expensive and got the worst. Heavy static always loosing connection with phone and does not fit well on ear. Replaced it with the motorola 700 and there is a world of difference.
1,THE CD SUCCS,"I AIN'T NO BRAND BUT THIS CD SUCCS. EVEN MACC 10 SUCCS. ALL YOU SLOBS, BRANDS, SNOOPS, DIRUS, ARE SORRY IN THE RAP GAME. LEAVE IT TO THE GC'S AND LOCS. PIRU KILLAS, LA BRANDS DIE TOO. C'Z UP COMRADE."
2,5 good traCCs,"I'M FROM DA C SIDE AN YAH I GOT IT.THE TITLE TRACC HOW DEEP IS YOUR HOOD IS CLASSIC,YAH KNOW MY NAME,NO MUZZLE,GIVE IT UP,AN RIDE AGAIN ARE ALL HARD TRACC's.CRIPS JUSS HAVE MORE GOOD BANGERZ.."
2,"The A&M material is good, the Monogram material is weak.","Chris Montez had two phases in his career. The first was that of an early rock & roller on Monogram Records, doing fairly standard, by-the-numbers early rock stuff of little interest - it makes up the first half of this CD. Chris was reborn, however, as a jazz-pop easy listening singer in the mid-60s on A&M Records, blending jazz standards with a rock beat for a new sound that has since become obscure - that's the cool stuff that makes up the second half of this CD - and not his best songs at that. Unfortunately, the original A&M albums are available on CD only in Japan. Seek out his fan pages on the Web."
4,Some Kinda Fun!,"This was a great overview of Chris Montez's career.""Let's Dance"" is one of the greatest rock'n roll songs ever recorded.To be honest,I preferred Chris's early rockin' stuff more than his later jazzy pop period.Don't get me wrong,I love ""Call Me""and ""The More I See You"",but 10 songs in a row in the same style got a little repetitious.All in all,though,a great tribute to a guy who carried on the Ritchie Valens tradition of Rockin' good songs!"
2,Call Me?,How can there be a Chris Montez hits album without Call Me and The More I See You? What is going on?
3,Interesting new look at Nazism.,"This book is, at heart, a book about the art exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. Don't expect a book full of pictures, as the majority of this book is descriptive text. The art isn't nearly as shocking as one might expect- and perhaps that is the point.The main body of the book covers a general examination of Jewish art and specifically attitudes towards art and the holocaust. The works themselves are not described in as much detail as I would have liked. It referes not just to the art of the holocaust but more general controversial works, and I feel at times the exhibition itself is neglected.This is probably worth buying as a companion to the exhibition- it is certainly not a substitute for seeing the exhibition itself.The book is well presented and clear, and is suitable from anyone aged about thirteen upward. One artworks does feature partial nudity, however, so more sensative readers should be warned."
3,epi sg,"I got the epiphone sg over the g-400 (too expensive) as a practice and recording guitar for our band. It plays and sounds far better than any Yamaha Pacifica with the dual humbuckers giving it a meaty sound.However, it pales in conparison to the real Gibsons due to the dodgy electronics, the bolt on neck, the dodgy color and the hard playing at anything below the 15th fret. I also own a squier p-bass special which, for around the same price, offers far better value for money (even with the dodgy electronics-the bane of cheap guitarists)"
1,Good for a few laughs,"This video is hilarious. A bunch of non-scientist sit in front of the camera trying to pick apart the most widely held scientific theories of the day. It is pretty obvious that the people they interview don't even understand these theories but that doesn't stop them from critiquing any flaw they think they can find. Most of the arguments used are of the ""straw man"" type.The video is fun to watch, just make sure you educate yourself and don't believe it's lies."
4,Not bad for the prices of $149,"I bought this item last month from Amazon.com for $149. I thought it is using some kind of hand-like massage motors, and not those vibration motors. When the item arrived and I setup, I found out they are using the vibration motors! A little disappointed I am. But I use it, it is not bad if you don't mind the vibration motors. The heat feature is great. However, the knod that is supposed to hold the sitting position isn't holding well. The leather-like material really feels like a lether. The vibration really vibrates the whole floor, so I suggest to put on carpetted areas only. I personally like the hand-like massage chair better. But this $149 chair is worth the price. Others would sell for over $300."
3,Massage chair,"Several people got this chair to use at a desk, but I find it much to low and it does not adjust up and down. The massage works well and it is comportable but not as an office chair."
2,"Comfy chair, weak ""massage""","This is a sad invention. Instead of massaging, it vibrates and in no way ""relieves stress"". Besides this, it's very low budget: first off, the label for a ""thigh massage"", actually vibrates at you calves (on the ottoman). Where it is labeled ""lumbar"", it actually massages your thighs. When you try the pre-designed massages (""modes""), the chair vibrates very quickly at seemingly random spots. The whole thing is almost musical. Whoever designed this chair should try a different profession. Besides all this, the chair itself is fairly comfortable, and the heat is nice, although a little weak."
2,disappointed,"I was very excited that one of My ""boys"" had bought Me this chair, but when it finally arrived, I was very disppointed. the motors are semi weak, it does NOT feel like 10 motors more like 6 if that. the chair's pic is also very unrealistic in My opinion, the seating it not attached, its a pad, very cheaply made not worth the price at all... I wouldnt pay more then 80.00 for this chair!!"
1,Not very helpful,a fine book for people who happen to have small spaces AND a lot of money -- like only those crammed into Manhattan apartments.
3,Not bad,"Does what's intended, but it the curved knife end isn't as sharp as I'd like, and because it's serrated there is no easy way to sharpen it."
2,Nice top lid but the rest looks like a middle school wood shop project!,"I ordered this box because I liked the color and the large size. When I opened the package I was intially happy, as the top lid looks very nice. Unfortunately I was not as happy as I unpacked the rest of the parts. The wood and stain on the box is very cheap. The bottom is open slats; I expected it to be solid given the product description, ""Constructed to withstand the elements."" There are a few nicks, dings, and even splits in the wood, all of which produce splinters.I probably will not return the item, but sand out the dings and splinters myself and give it a good wood oil treatment. It looks OK (not great) overall, and while it is not as high quality as I was expecting it will probably be fine for a season or two.Pros: easy to assemble, large size, nice top lidCons: cheap wood used for the box, open slat bottom"
1,Absolute JUNK,"I bought this product from Charles Keath last year. It is so warped, split , checked and cracked now that it will soon be going into the fire pit. It is also carried by Montgomery Ward online and a few others. Keath was zero help, as well as the importer somewhere in Indiana."
2,Not a good guide to skyscrapers,This is a book for 5 year-olds and that's about it. I really regret buying it.
5,Engrossing story,"My son is not a strong reader, dislikes reading immensely, and can usually get through only three or four pages of a book before he starts complaining to stop. However, he wouldn't put this book down - he read all 67 pages over the course of an afternoon without stopping, and then immediately began a report on the book. (He had already read a book for a book report; the report was complete, but he liked this book so much that he started over.)Furthermore, he asked for the rest of the series! Multiple firsts; thank you, Louis Sachar."
4,"It was really cool, he thinks he is kidnapped at birth","It was really neat, I would present it to all who belive in imaginatio"
1,looks can be decieving,"I bought this album at the dollar store on sale day so it was 85 cents. It looked like it'd be rockabilly, but it turns out it's just generic highschool-sounding punk rock. If that's your thing, then get this cd, but if you're looking for rockabilly look elsewhere."
3,lots of ideas zipped into a single book,"This is a book that compressed so many ideas into so few pages. Using lots of visual language. Those with a grasp of branding will be inspired by what they find here, and those who would like to understand it better after reading this book will ""get it."" This deceptively simple book offers lots of insights, often very practical ones. Needs better editing though. Some typos. But overall very worth reading."
1,Waste of money,"I am embarrassed both for the author and the publisher of this book. This book has over 100 typographical errors (I lost count), including mistakes that a basic spell-check function would catch. Sentences missing words, spelling errors, grammatical mistakes - you name it, this book has it.Regarding the content, it rambles and makes no sense. The author/publisher uses a lot of fonts and logos, but I didn't see one original thought. Anyone with any marketing experience will find that this book is a waste of money."
5,What a surprising simple yet useful brand book,"I don't know how the author did this. A book full of useful concpets and brings so much clarity to the world of branding. This book reduces the complexity of branding into something managebale and every brand managers can use. An interesting part on luxury goods branding which I enjoy a lot. Must read for those who are interested in this profesionally. Simple yet deep. In fact, I believe this is now widely adapated as a main text book on brand in many MBA schools. I have seeb this in different languages when I was travelling overseas this summer."
5,A very talented pianist!,"I came to finding Laurie Z through Amazon. I was purchasing some music composed by another talented pianist, Lorie Line, when I saw Laurie Z listed as other recommended artist. I have never regreted adding Laurie to my order. Thank you Amazon for introducing me to this wonderful artist. I look forward to buying more of Laurie's albums in the near future. I can rave on and on about each of the pieces, but the sound samples will do more justice than my words. I will just state that Laurie is among my favorites now."
4,Awesome Bill,"A MUST READ!!Great insight into NASCAR, this book describes the 'Good, Bad & the Ugly'Bill is a legend. If it wasn't for his whinning more poeple would recognize him as so."
3,The People of Lake Kutubu and Kikori: Changing Meanings of Daily Life,Having lived with these people the book is very good.
4,nosebleed gabba,"this is a double dose of nosebleed gabba. also known as speedcore. it doesn't mess, and neither should you. extremist veterans only. you have been warned!"
1,THESE ARE RE-RECORDINGS - NOT ORIGINALS!,"These are not the original 1960s hits -- they are mid-1980s re-recordings that Petula made in Nashville for her ""Give It A Try"" album. The other two reviews on Amazon for this CD are incorrect -- they refer to a different but similarly titled CD called ""Complete Golden Hits Collection"" which does have Petula's 1960s original. This CD from the Masters label is poor quality packaging as well. Do yourself a favor and buy ""Ultimate Petula Clark"" or ""Petula Clark Platinum & Gold Collection"" from BMG for the TRUE ORIGINALS and best sound and packaging."
5,A great debut CD,"Yes, that's really an interesting debut CD. Great voice (sometimes remembering Tom Waits), great music (rock and slow songs). I think that this CD is quite a must for people who likes good music."
5,The greatest most unheralded album of all time,"I can't say enough good things about this record, it really is the greatest most unheralded debut record of all time. Why the Canadian music buying public didn't pick up on this gem will truly confound me to this day. The Blue Sickness and All Children Believe In Heaven are worthy follow-ups, but this is still my favourite BK album. In fact, I liked this record so much, I gave it to Elvis Costello in the hopes that he would be able to generate some buzz around it (a la Sexsmith). Anyway, buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Beautiful Bocephus King,Bocephus King is the most underated artist of this time. Between the amazing production and creativity it is easy to get yourself lost in any BK album. The one after this Blues Sickness and the newest All Children Believe In Heaven are amazing albums as well. Check them out.
1,Can we sink much lower?,"This book talks about kids getting involved with drugs and points out the ineptidude that older people have concerning the times. What this book fails to point out is how deceived these kids were. After all these years, if the characters were real people, I suspect they would regret using drugs (especially LSD) to begin with. These characters weren't noble for exploring drugs, they were bored and lacked imagination to reach for their true potential. I strongly recommend reading biographies about real people who accomplished real things."
1,I remember this book,"I read it when I was about 12 and even then I knew it wasn't factual. I'd never even tried marijuana at that time but I knew it didn't cause hallucinations. Please. I can't remember much else about this book; a guy's brother comes home from college and drugs have changed him. It was meant to look like a ""cool"" book but was instead a moralistic diatribe against drugs. Good for a laugh."
4,The anti-drug book of choice in my high school days,"When I was in high school, this was the anti-drug novel of choice, likely the most read book among the students. Jim is a sixteen-year-old boy and when summer vacation arrives, his older brother Kevin returns from college. However, this is not the same Kevin that Jin idolized before he departed. Now into LSD and marijuana, Kevin is on the edge of burnout.Jim tries to reconnect with Kevin and there are moments when the past is revisited. However, things continue to deteriorate until Kevin freaks out on a drug trip and is hospitalized. He recovers and at the end, the brothers begin to reconnect, with the younger now playing the role of the older.Drugs were rampant in my high school while I was there; many students were regularly under the influence on campus. However, the popularity of this book did have some influence in reducing the consumption, so that was a positive consequence."
4,Thunderbird is truly a classic,"I really love this new album! It is different from her usual style but it's still Cassandra all the same. I love the way her smoky voice rides and intertwines with the deep base and percussions.Especially tracks like ""Closer to You"", ""It would Be So Easy"", ""Poet"" and ""Strike a Match"". You have a great introduction to her new style with ""Go to Mexico"" and of course her classic ""bluesy"" ballad styles with ""Easy Rider"" and ""Red River Valley"". My husband who had never heard of her can't get enough of this new album!The old adage rings true...Like fine wine, she get's better with age!"
3,Too Many Pop Covers,"Simply, this isn't one of Cassandra's best. Her last 2-3 cd's have relied too much on pop covers of various merit which really diminishes the effectiveness of one of the most marvellous voices in jazz-blues. I have seen her live several times and she outstanding as a performer and unequalled in the jazz-blues genre, but straying so far (for a wider commercial appeal?) from her blues roots only serves to murk her vocal and musical identity. My fear is this wonderful vocalist will end up in the same situation as Etta James who abandoned her Texas blues roots for a not very convincing or engaging party rock-blues repertoire."
2,is this jazz?,"I'm a little disappointed by this new Cassandra Wilson album in 2006; I loved all of her past efforts of the Blue Note period, since ""Blue light 'til dawn"", in 1993; Cassandra is an artist who likes to experience many kinds of music, and put them all into her songs, all together, both in originals and in covers; I consider her style as jazz, just jazz, with many contaminations, with rock, pop, soul, blues, brazil...But, in this case, is this jazz? I don't think so; Cassandra tries to reach another level, but her music is too different from what she had done in the past, from what people like her to make.I don't love this album."
2,Big disappointment,"I am a big fan of Cassandra Wilson and was duped into buying this disc after reading reviews here and elsewhere. I knew after the first 3 songs that trouble was brewing as they all sounded alike. Indeed, the entire thing suffers from the same muddy mix and monotone vocals. What a waste. No diversity in song selection and no vocal range. She should lose T-Bone Burnett for her next effort. *Note* She has displayed this same poor judgment in concert with her song list."
3,too commercial,"I was very disappointed with Cassandra Wilson's latest effort, Thunderbird. I thought that it lacked ""Thunder"" and that down home gutsy sound that Wilson is noted for. The tracks weren't interesting and fell short on musical depth."
1,Beware,"I bought this because I needed it for a job I was doing and I really like to have a hard copy of the music I buy. Eight tracks on the CD, tracks 5 through 8 did not play on any machine I tried it on. Can't believe it is just this one CD. Seems like more of a manufacturing issue."
3,Better than average,"Just saw the complete series and although I did enjoy it I'd have to say it's just better than average. I appreciate the effort made to try and cover real life topics but I just wish the story lines would have been written better (sorry Al). A similar but funnier series, in my opinion, is News Radio. Also, it doesn't hurt that Megyn Price is in it. Anyone seen her in ""Love Happens""?"
5,A petite treasure,I especially love Herrick's poem about Daffofils and wantedto have a copy of it along with other of hiswonderful poems. This petite book of his writingsis filled with little treasures.
3,Service good - product rare....,"The service was excellent....The book was well used, but serviceable....That was no fault on the part of the supplier; it's simply that English speaking cultures are making no demand for Karl Marx's out of print later writings. So I had to buy a French - in print - copy!....."
3,uneven and doesn't hold up,"This is one of those books that falls into the category of ""ahead of its time."" Well, that was 40 years ago. Does it hold up? Kinda-sorta. It goes on and on, mostly about records nobody cares about anymore. A lot of sharp comments but you have to wade through a lot to find the insights. But if you like Greil Marcus and haven't read this, you should have a look."
2,Disappointing!,"This CD was released in 1995 and the record company who released it gave me the chance to evaluate it. Laurie Z plays New Age music that will remind you of Yanni. Unfortunately, that's where all the comparisons end. I felt the CD was lethargic and didn't have much punch. It was routine and didn't give me much vibes. There are some moments, though. I enjoyed the track, ""My Perfect Love"". It displayed her potential with her beautiful acoustic piano playing. But then the rest of her album got too ""high tech"". I guess you could call it music for the times. It was released more than 10 years ago, so time has not been good to its evolvement. Laurie Z probably has some better CD's out there. Just not this one."
2,Mainstream Trance Anthems,Yet another one of those trance compilation albums featuring the same tracks found on a dozen other trance compilations albums. More than a few very rough track transtions round out an uninteresting set for this one.2/5 stars
5,Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the Ravers' Anthem! The sweet melodic progressive trancy beats build nicely... (dib-ip, dib-ip, dip-dip-dip, scheeeeeuuuuuuuuuu....) Then the beats hit and you just gotta jump up and dance hard!! (BUHP-BUHP-BUHP-BUHP! DAH-DAH-DAH!!) It flows sooo nicely between tracks, and the scratching is unbelieveable! (veu-veu, vivivipheu! whishuh-whishuh-waah!) Sooo nice... sooooooo nice."
5,Dark and lush.....,"I have read other Beauman books but none have captured me like this one. All the others were quick reads that I enjoyed but wouldn't want to put on my bookself. However, this one is on my bookself because I loved everything about it. I was tempted to even peek at the back to see how it ended because it got so suspenseful. I didn't(thank god), the novel flows seamlessly into your neuropathways and leads you to a dark world that makes you want to be part of Constance's glamour she casts on everyone. You never know what is true with her or if she even knows what that word means. Constance has no morals, only urges and she fascinates you as you read about her giving into them."
5,Timeless romance,"39 year old Laura runs a successful advertising company with a business partner. Laura's lover Alex, had died five years earlier in a tragic accident. Laura has had brief affairs since, but is not looking for a relationship. Then she meets 23 year old Kate. Despite feelings that Laura hasn't felt in years, she knows she can't get involved with Kate due to the age difference. But more than that, Laura knows that she could easily lose control and fall in love with her. Laura becomes involved with Kelly, a love them and leave them girl. She knows having sex with Kelly will distract her from Kate. But how can she juggle seeing both women? Will she give love between herself and Kate a go, or throw it all away?A fairly short, passionate romance. A perfect read for an afternoons pleasure."
3,classical romance for a rainey afternoon,"I am a great fan of Ann's Julia's Song so I bought the ebook of the republished ""Letting Go"". Unfortunately this is IMO a case which does re-publishing not proud. First the book has barely over a 100 pages and the ebook costs $ 11.50, secondly there are typos and slight formatting problems throughout the book. So, I was less then thrilled with price vs. performance.The story itself is a ""classical"" romance with a liberal sprinkling of drama and sweetness and is a good read for a rainey afternoon."
2,"Interesting, for sure.","I liked the acting, top of the line cast who gave top notch performances. I'd have to agree with several other reviewers on the lighting and make up . . . sub par may be an understatement. You've all seen Back to the Future II, correct? Remember when they aged George McFly (Crispin Glover) for the 2015 time period? Yeah, the movie make up here is just as bad . . . you'd think Hollywood could improve this in 23 years. I didn't hate the movie by any means, but I really felt that all it truly highlighted was J Edgar continually fighting his inner demons. J Edgar Hoover seemed like a real ass, with an ego the size of Texas."
4,Finally Found IT,This is the only place we were able to find this to purchase. Price was good and husband is very happy with it.
2,Snooze-fest with distracting makeup,Watching this movie was like doing homework. It crawled along at an unnecessarily sluggish pace. The actors' makeup and vocal accents were conspicuous to the point of near-cartoonish. I was not able to stay engaged for the movie's duration. I got up and took my time with a bathroom break and a snack.
3,OK...not great.,"The movie was okay. The historical information in the movie is interesting, but dependent upon your age (if you remember the period) or your interest in history, you may or may not like it. The acting was good, and I hadn't realized how powerful J Edgar was until I watched this movie."
2,disappointed in Clint Eastwood,"I love Clint Eastwood but am terribly disappointed in him for this effort. This had the feel of an Olliver Stone movie...and no..that is not a good thing. Too many unverified rumors and conspiracy theories passed off as being factual for my taste. DiCaprio isn't bad and the movie is still better than most of the crap Hollywood puts out but it falls far short of the mark Clint set with Unforgiven, Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby."
3,j edgar,"I had looked forward to viewing this movie for months but was terrible disappointed in it. Thought Leo was great as J Edgar, but that is all. Overrated! Happy with Amazon. Really think they are a great company & have never had a problem with them."
3,J Edgar,Not bad - interesting and well worth watching. I would not purchase this movie. DeCaprio was amazing and I do not like him generally speaking.
2,Dissapointing,The movie did not give an accurate historical perspective. The movie had a different agenda. The poorest Clint Eastwood picture yet.
3,Way too long - Editor asleep @ the switch,"The direction was good, but the content was diluted by too much time spent (in what I think is an effort in) building the character."
3,digital download,"J. Edgar (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) this is the worst download i have ever had, it is very confusing and i am not able to use it on windows."
1,I thought it would be history but it's homosexual propaganda,"Terrible. I was interested in learning about Hoover, his role in creating the FBI, American history, and the like but it's focused on speculation about Hoover and as anyone can see, this is the homosexual activist's propaganda to promote their perversion or same-sex marriage, etc. I'm REALLY disappointed in Clint Eastwood! Overall the movie was boring, annoying, and disgusting watching the two men interact."
1,Why?,"Why was this movie made? Was the world incomplete without a J. Edgar Hoover biography? There was about as much of a demand and need for this movie as there was for TWO movies about Truman Capote within one year. (Remember the year of those two inane disasters?)What's next for Clint Eastwood...a Pauly Shore biography?I have always respected and admired Clint Eastwood, but I would not accept this movie on DVD or Blu-ray if it was given to me. Maybe I would accept it and use the disc as a coaster for drinks."
4,Good movie,Well made movie that gives a little more insight into the life of Hoover. Im not a big Leanardo fan but he did a great job in this one. Give it a watch if you have time.
2,One of Eastwood's Weakest Directorial Efforts,"Leonardo DiCaprio's impressive performance cannot save ""J. Edgar"" (2011) from its dire mediocrity. Repeating the structural mistakes that plagued ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" Clint Eastwood's direction simply lacks focus. Working with a fragmented script by Dustin Lance Black, he resorts to confusing flashbacks and cross-cutting distractions. Eastwood never seems engaged in the Hoover saga except for the Lindbergh kidnapping and its aftermath. Not helping matters are the poor lighting, Armie Hammer's embarrassing old-age makeup, and the utter waste of Judi Dench. Though DiCaprio received an Oscar nomination for his detailed portrayal, he deserved a much better film."
1,worst $3.99 ever spent,"Plodding plot, if you can call it a plot. Probably the worst make-up I've ever seen in film. Set's dark, gloomy and foreboding(of what I have yet to glean). Dialog of no useful, insightful content. Looks like Clint Eastwood is in need of a visit by Hoover's Doctor. I think he's running low on vitamins, either that or he's just become obtuse."
3,"Sometimes compelling, but distracting photography abounds","This is a sometimes interesting look at the long career of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI that he oversaw for decades, as well as his relationship with a male associate. DiCaprio does the best he can with the role. What distracted me, though, was the use of constant shadow, filtering, and a palette of browns and grays. I wondered if something was wrong with my vision."
2,A Big Yawn!,"My wife and I watched this movie and I had to wake her uptowards the end of the moive. She called it a ""sleeper!"" Pun intended!Not one of Eastwood's best movies. Giving this movie two stars out of fiveis over-rated."
2,J. Edgar - Boring,"Perhaps it was my own fault avoiding reviews, I never had high expectations and it is not the kind of movie I would go to a theater to see, but this fell even below by moderate expectations.So I went into thinking it would cover how he built the FBI, set the direction, and getting some of the inside view on how he leveraged his information, not how he sorted it, which really seemed to impress the writer and director. The movie touched on these things but a very light treatment, more like filler, well except how he arranged the infromation.I think they missed a opportunity to explore a person that was perhaps one of the most powerful men on the Planet, who was never elected, not rich, but armed only with the power of information, and the backing of the US Government.I can see how some would like it, I just had no interest in his personal life, as a person he really is not that interesting, what that person did with th4e FBI is very interesting to me."
2,"Slow, over-cooked, bad acting.","Sorry,but this was a slow movie, no action, poor acting, dark, predictable, poor makeup. Not recommended. Don't rent it. I'd rather get my teeth pulled."
2,Very slow and quiet,I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but it ended up putting me right to sleep. The gay aspect is hardly in the movie at all ( unless I was asleep for it). If you are a Leo fan than you will like this one. If you are looking for a bio of a gay man and cross dresser then this is not the movie you are looking for.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I have been waiting for this movie for months to come out on DVD for months. I saw it at my library yesterday so I signed it out for free and watched it with my wife. The movie is boring and not worth buying.I couldn't wait for it to be over.
3,Interesting,A bit on the boring side. You find out a few things about the man and there are some good things about this movie. It was ok.
2,It's okay,Leonardo is always good. The movie was okay. I was very suprised by the ending to this movie. It's okay.
2,Never Really Got Moving,"I am all for the bio-pics. Usually love them, even if it tends to be more bio that 'pic'. But this one just never really seemed to move anywhere."
5,J.Edgar,Great movie for history. There a lot of items in the movie that I did not know about J. Edgar.
3,J. Edgar,"I expected this movie to be really good since I like Leo,but it was really boring. Thought that it would be more interesting."
3,Slow but good acting,The quality of the acting was good but the pacing was slow. We watched this in a group and some liked the switching back and forth and some didn't . Sometimes it was hard to see which timeframe they portrayed. It was a true character study but sometimes a bit dry.
2,Over reated,I just found the story very thin and the charachers shallow. Plotline boring A big yawn. Leonardo as J. Edgar is terribly mis cast.
1,Snozzzzze! Why was this movie even made Eastwood?,"Tedious film of a forgettable character reinforced by Eastwood's typical jaded viewpoint. Almost childish cliche of a gay love story as well. Big waste of time, talent and a buck. Three thumbs way down."
1,Hoover Underdone,"Poor history, terrible movie. Contains just enough truth to make it presentable.Seems to be caught between truth and a fiction.The Hoover I remember was a publicity-seeking racist of the first order,here he only has a few concerns. Waste of money purchasing thisDVD. Maybe Mr. Eastwood should consider retirement."
1,J. Edgar,Worst than Titanic. I think you do not need more words. The actor was in his way to become an actor besides a cute boy
1,Eastwood overrated,"Totally miscast, script was disjointed and very liberal with truth of actual events. Movies like this drive me back to books where I can recieve some semblance of truth and not Hollywoods interpretation of what is proported to be the depiction of historical events. Not the first time Eastwood interjects his personal theories as what is what when it comes to the historical record."
1,I can't get past the bad acting.,"This movie might have been a compelling story, but I really couldn't tell you. All I can tell you is that my suspension of disbelief was punctured, no, shredded, by this phenomenal underachievement by Leo. The accent fluctuates. His version of an old man reminds me of a cartoon, and, well, I just didn't buy it. If you can forget the acting and just focus on the lines, this movie might be for you."
1,Leo,"Boring, boring, boring. I watched it three nights in a row and it put me to sleep each night. Never did finish the whole thing. Will never insert it in my DVD Player again."
3,Interesting Fellow,"J Edgar is an interesting movie about the life and times of the man. He certainly was a forward thinker that could see beyond the box. He developed better crime solving techniques and kept all sorts of records on various people, yet J Edgar himself remains a mysterious figure surrounded by much speculation. In this film, Leonardo DiCaprio does a fabulous job of portraying J Edgar in various stages of life."
1,Boring,"There wasn't much of anything interesting or exciting in this movie. Quite boring, so save your money for something better."
1,"Rating, J.Edgar","Poor scrip,horrible acting, questionable veracity. Sorry I watched it, Nothing I have ever read ever supported the story. Example of ""do all you can to berate heroes of the past."""
3,My least favorite Dicaprio role,"Not a great effort by Clint, and Dicaprio could only do so much with it. Worth a watch if you are bored and like Dicaprio when he's not doing violence."
1,What a waste.,"The lack of continuity in this movie drove us crazy and we were tempted a number of times to turn it off. However, we kept hoping it would get better, it never did. Thank goodness we rented it through Amazon instead of buying a DVD. Clint Eastwood has directed some excellent movies and to say we were disappointed in J. Edgar is an understatement."
2,A denigrating view of a historical figure.,"For my taste I would have enjoyed more historical content. There was some, but the story was more of a personal soap opera dealing with Hoover's personal problems. It seemed to focus so much on the negative and abnormal characteristics of his life. It leaves questions as to accuracy."
2,Did I watch the same movie?,"Not understanding the 4 or 5 star reviews AT ALL. This was a man whose development (and that of the FBI) over time needed to be anchored in the many different faces of America that he lived through. The best way to do that would have been chronologically. The best part of the movie was a decent stretch of continuity. But the jumping back and forth gimmick got real old, real fast and took away from the movie.As with his portrayal of Howard Hughes, Dicaprio continues to impress with his performances. All the actors were good, except the Burn Notice guy. This is a movie that would definitely benefit from a more linear edit."
1,Forget this one,"In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors in movies today. Yet, his skill is not able to overcome a poor movie."
3,J. Edgar,Way too long with too much information anyone who is an American already knew about this horrible man. The only saving grace was Leo's performance as well as his partner and mom (judy dench)I was disappointed with Clint Eastwood I thought there would be more to the back stroy
3,Movie --- J. Edgar,J. Edgar was an interesting movie about such a well-known figure in US history. The seamy parts of his long-time reign were mostly glossed over.
2,Clint's Worst in a Long Time,"I normally love Clint Eastwood movies, but this one does not work for me.................It lacked the tautness and narrative pace I have come to expect from his films. I do not think he is losing his touch because the recent Changeling I found to be very well done. Everything seemed wrong in this film...............narrative POV, lighting, makeup, you name it. The ONLY good scenes to me were the clip of Cagney playing a Fed in the movie G Men and the subsequent scene at the Stork Club where Hoover is obviously distressed by the heterosexual attention paid him by Ginger Rogers and her party...................that was Clint as his best...music, lighting, blocking.............things that suffered in the remainder of the film. I hope he comes back with something better."
2,Difficult to wade through,"My mom gave me this movie on DVD after she bought it; I generally can enjoy biographical movies, but this one just dragged on. It was interesting to see how the FBI was formed and the mindset of the organizer (disregarding Hollywood license, of course), but this movie could have been 90 minutes and been about right. A lot of the acting was a bit wooden for me."
2,J. Wikipedia,"Every cliché of biographical movies is in ""J. Edgar."" Even HBO isn't making such on-the-nose tripe as this anymore. The framework is simplistic, J. Edgar Hoover is writing his memoirs and the movie is told in flashback as he recalls his life. Then, a re-enactment of moments in Hoover's life happen that never go deeper than what you would find on Hoover's Wikipedia page until it addresses his alleged homosexuality. There are parts of this in the second half of the movie that are affecting and pretty good, mostly when relating Hoover and Tolson's relationship in the second half of their lives. Unfortunately, in the early scenes, Armie Hammer plays Tolson almost as a gay stereotype and does little but announce his limitations as an actor.Nothing new here at all and DiCaprio isn't even that great."
2,"Great man, poor movie",They had a chance to make a great movie but failed. They spend too much time on the gay rumors. Its basically what 2/3 of the movie are about. Don't start thinking I'm a homophob because I'm not. I just wish they would've stuck with the facts.
3,J Edgar,"I loved the movie itself. The copy at times skips,( that could be due to previous wear and tear) but, when you restart it it does play smoothly all the way to the end."
3,just okay,The historical information was very interesting but it moved too slowly and so much of the filming was literally dark it was hard to see.
3,Was worth watching,"I was curious about this movie and for the most part, enjoyed it. Not a great movie, but it was interesting (to me). Nothing groundbreaking, but there were points in it that enlightened me to who he was and the era in which he lived."
3,DiCaprio-GOOD; JEdgar (the man) - TWISTED,Make-up was a tour de force. Production was jerky and ommitted several historic events that would have tied the sequences together. I had two false starts until I was forced by a cable outage to watch the entire disk.
1,Terrible,Seeing this movie in theatre was especially painful to see leonardo look ridiculous with a terrible makeup job. I was aware that hoover was a closet homosexual and that some of the movie might be based on that but i did think it would be more about history and less about a male love story.Moneyball (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack Including Bonus DVD) [Blu-ray] buy moneyball instead which was atleast mentioned at the academy awards.
1,D.A.D. (Dull as Dirt),"Leonardo DiCaprio is horribly mis-cast as the autocratic J. Edgar Hoover. The make-up is laughable, attesting the notion this movie was done on-the-cheap."
1,J. Edgar,I felt the story line jumped all over the place n it didnt capture my attention enough to see it until the end and I love Dicaprio movies!! :(
1,No More Ultraviolet,"I'd buy this movie (and many others) if it was a standard digital copy, not the Ultraviolet version. I want to keep the digital copy as long as I want (Ultraviolet digital copies expire) and I watch most of my digital copies of movies while on international flights and overseas where the Ultraviolet version is useless."
2,Terrible rendition of a life full of drama,"Just terrible terrible story-telling. Nothing dramatic. No suspension. No greater-than-itself meaning. Just a plain old tear-jerker, following the templates of 1950's Classic. Don't know who should be called out for this, the screen writer or the director? But it is just such a lame movie."
2,clint's in a slump!,"his last 3 films have all been yawners! his last good movie was GRAN TOURINO.J EDGAR is definitely the worst EASTWOOD directed film i've ever seen.the only positive thing i can say is that DICAPRIO looked like J EDGAR.this was a cold movie; lacking any emotion what's so ever. hard to believe a movie about the totally evil HOOVER COULD BE A SNOOZE FEST, but under EASTWOOD'S direction and the terrible script, that what it turned into.EASTWOOD is no longer one of our great american directors. maybe it's time he called it quits."
4,"""J. Edgar"" - much better than anticipated!","This is an underrated film, which I caught somewhat by accident....Overall, Clint Eastwood's treatment of Hoover struck me as more balanced, than I'd anticipated. While I am certainly not an historian, I am assuming that there is a great deal of material in this movie, which cannot be historically verified. Over the years, however, I've done a lot of reading about the Lindbergh kidnapping and the execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann. From what I know of that case,J. Edgarseemed historically accurate - at least on that subject matter.On another note, I could never have imagined DeCaprio in this role. His makeup transformation into an older Hoover was incredible. On the other hand, the makeup transformation of Armand Hammer into an older Clyde Tolson seemed amateurish."
1,J. Edgar,"Here's a film that had all the makings of an award-winner, if not a modern classic: an acclaimed director, an award-winning screenwriter, an all-star cast and a compelling subject. Somehow, though, the final product managed to be less than the sum of its parts. So what was the problem? There are a few. While the actors all offered up top notch performances, poor lighting and subpar makeup took away from the aesthetics of the film, while a confusing narrative and humdrum storytelling diminished any impact it might have otherwise had. As far as biopics go, you'll certainly learn a little bit about Mr. Hoover from J. Edgar, but because the story fails to explore some of the more interesting aspects of his character from any significant angle, you may find it all a little mundane and uninspiring."
3,Expected new copy,The movie itself is great..Dicaprio played it so well that I forgot that he was acting and it was not J. Edgar himself...but I thought I had purchased a new copy...not a copy from some public library.
3,"By the end the title should have been ""J Edgar and Clyde Tolson""","Unfortunately, this movie leaves you wondering things like ""was that really true"". Biographical films sometimes leave you craving more information but usually not from a basis of wondering if it was an accurate portrayal. Since J. Edgar Hoovers run in Washington spanned an incredible length of time its surely tough to pack everything in to a 2+ hour movie. For that, I give Clint credit for making the film interesting and inserting as many nuggets as possible. Thats why this gets 3 stars. Despite longing for a little more about various topics and despite how the movie jumps around in timeline the film is well done. The problem to me that really pulls the movie down in the end was that it ends up just being a relationship movie about J. Edgar and Clyde Tolson. That storyline gets so overplayed and it overwhelms the entire story."
5,refreshing,You can see my review of the remix album for a little more in-depth opinion on why this is a good idea.My normal musical tastes seem to be a bit different than most other reviewers. If you like dark experimental/ambient/dnb like reload photek or amon tobin you should check this out.
4,"Almost as good as ""Khmer""","This is lovely, innovative stuff. The only problem is that it doesn't take off much from the direction set by ""Khmer"". It also contains two unfortunate pieces with lyrics, but they're short. However, these are minor complaints. The overall sound reminds me, if anything, of Jon Hassel and Brian Eno's collaboration twenty years ago, but essentially, this is music like no one else's. Buy ""Khmer"" first, then this if you're still hungry."
4,one scary little beauty,"Solid Ether is a great name for this album. It's solid, it's ethereal, and it's just plain wonderful. Although many seem to find that this album is merely a continuation of Molvaer's previous album Khmer, I find that the improvements are obvious. The sound is a bit more complex, the emotion is more pronounced. It is heavily addicting, and has become a source of music for several of my short films. I do find the two part song Merciful to be distracting and not in the least bit interesting, but both parts are short and relatively painless. I would recommend this album to fans of Cinematic Orchestra or any other dark, breakbeat and guitar-laced jazz."
4,Chance encounter in the record store,"I was listening to music samples in the record store and bumped into this CD. Soulful, urban, and unique are some words that come to mind.Some of the most raw, breathy trumpet solos I have ever heard. It made my throat sore just listening to them. Every note sounds like it is on the verge of breaking.I don't know if it belongs in the ""Jazz"" section but I'll take it."
3,Stretching An Idea!,"Not what I would call jazz. Not sure what genre this fits into! Ok for ""background noise."""
1,ORTHODOX FAITH EXCLUDED!!!,"I have to say I thought the book was a great reference, but I was very sad to see that it did not talk about Eastern Chrisitianity. I suppose the author put The Orthodox Church in the ""Roman Catholic Church"" Category. I wish that it would have listed The Orthodox Faith under Christianity on its own. Shame on the Authors for not researching Christianity more."
1,"Sorry, there were not any negative stars.","After reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that I have great distain for this author- or at least distain for this closed minded piece of work. He gives an unfair account of other religions outside of Christianity, refering to every other religion as ""they"" and Christians as ""us"". I believe this to be one of the most closed mind, Christianity persuasive books I have read. Sadly, I can see a youth group getting hold of this book and tainting the ideas of the youth. If anyone is looking for real, unbiased information on other religions, I would suggest not wasting your money on this book, but rather doing some research of your own. If you liked this book, or you are content with believing the first thing you read, then I am very sorry for you."
1,Just awful!,"I think this guy just, straight up, wikipedia'd all the religions and ""reviewed"" them. Seriously, don't buy this book- it is so uneducated and just flat out moronic at some points and literally just WRONG sometimes! I am so glad i didn't pay for this bullsh*t book. My pastor loaned it to me and I refuse to give it back because I don't want anyone else reading it for their own sanity. This boom is just insane and ridiculous. NOT INFORMATIVE AT ALL!!!!!!!!I wish i could just give it zero stars...please heed this warning"
5,Great Book for overview in many religions,"I have shared this book with many teens/college age searchers.If you are reading htis for intellectual content, perhaps the cover would have helped you discover that what is beign shared is rough outlines of most of the world faith systems. Not every sect of Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism could ever possibly be mentioned. The book has been on my shelf for over 5 years. Great job and thanks for taking the time to identify, classify, compare and contrast this topic. For the ""haters"" out there,.. perhaps the truth is too much for you. Buy this book. Use it, Share it. Move on."
2,Cool...but plagued with inaccuracies,"This book has a cool layout that might be appealling to younger people, but even a quick glance highlighted some errors and a religious bias. For instance, groups like the Mormons are not ""cults"", unless of course you are of the Evangelical mindset and anyone that does not think like you is an abberrant group. The term is so over-used, it has completely lost its power. According Larson's New Book of Cults, their definition of a cultist would include five American presidents.In the section under Jehovah's Witnesses, on the practise of ""Disfellowshipping [excommunication]"" Etue adds, ""Infractions could be things like talking to a former Witness or reading your Bible without the aid of the Watchtower.""Nothing could be further from the truth, and this kind of info is indigenous of the apathy and misinformation that spreads regarding groups we do not like. That is what keeps certain ones labelled as ""cults."""
5,A Great Book,This is a great book for any Christian who wants to extinguish their doubts and questions about the other religions of the world. I highly recommend it for any one who wants to strengthen their faith with Jesus Christ. Even though it excludes much information about the other religions you must remember that it is only designed to give a brief summary of that religion so that people can reflect and compare that religion to Christianity. So that they can have a more basic understanding of what that religion believes in compared to Christianity. This book proves that Christianity is the right religion and it explains to you why it is. That's why I highly recommend this book.
1,Amazing.,"It's good to have proof that other Christians believe that teenagers are too stupid to be given adequate or truthful views of other religions. It's disrespectful to teens everywhere to assume that semantic shifts and logicisms (for an illogical God, natch) are reason for disbelief.I was smarter than this when I was five; if you can read, you don't need this book. If you give this to your kids: congrats! Maybe you should've adopted out!"
1,Holy (...)! What a piece of.....(...) Matter.,"Oh My God. What a horrible book. I was really wanting a book about religions. And, ironically, I wanted the author to be of no religion. Or, well, just un-biased. But, this is not that book. The writer has clearly not studied these religions very deeply. It was talking about buddhism, and made the statement that buddhists have no god. However, there's a bunch of gods in buddhism. Also, it says buddhist people shouldn't go to the movies, or wear jewlery, and should have no desire, except for being happy. And it said they can't die their hair. None of which is true. So yeah. I'm gonna try and look for a better book. But buy it if you want propaganda. Which I guess is kinda neat. If you're doing a report on propaganda."
1,Be wary of accuracy of provided information,"I was looking briefly at this book while at the grocery store and looked at the entry for my own religion. The information provided was not just biased, it was inaccurate. The publisher asserted that Mormons believed Jesus was the son of Joseph. This is not our belief. We believe that He is divine - literally the Son of God. If the book's publisher misrepresents a fundamental belief of my religion, I am left to wonder how it treats other religions that do not adhere to the Christian premise of the book. If you are looking for an academic overview of world religions, I suggestReligious Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know--And Doesn't. If you are looking for spiritual enlightenment, I suggest you go directly to the source of the religion(s) you are interested in. Most religions have an official website where you can get non-biased theological information."
1,Frustratingly biased.,"A pastor lent this to me because he thought my friends and I would find it interesting. This book isn't repuatable nor is it accurate. On a section describing fundamentalist Islam, there were pictures of GUNS. This book is far too biased."
1,Wow,"This book is the kind of horror that only fundementalists could love. It alternates between intentional ignorance and blatant ommission to attempt to prove that christianity is the only religion that is 'true'. As a read it bounces between mildly offensive to comical. Just about any other book would be better research for those wondering about other belief systems. This book is intended to reinforce christian prejudices, not enlighten."
2,Certainly expected more,"I really expected more from Coetzee, whom I had never read before picking up this book. I saw after finishing the book that it was originally published as separate stories or vignettes, and I'm not surprised. The title character spends all of her time giving speeches, which is strange for a novel--you think you will get a plot, but you just get lectured to. The writing is good, spare and cogent, but the book does not hang together well enough to be a novel, in my opinion. The best chapter, which is the last, has little or nothing to do with the prior chapters."
4,I want some moe.,"Moe's first CD, and it's pretty impressive. Definitely not followers of Phish/Dead. Full of energy. There is still one song that I just can't get into: ""St. Augustine."" I do however think No Doy beats out HeadSeed. Definitely worth the money."
5,"If it were possible to give 6 stars, I would have","Good stuff here, going from back to front. Time Ed is the quintessential moe. song, perhaps. At least, it's the favorite of many a moe.ron. Awesome, spacy guitar to end the tune, lyrics that are incredibly hard to understand, and so forth. Also captured here are Timmy Tucker and Recreational Chemistry, as well as Yodelittle. These tracks are soon to appear on moe.'s newest album, ""L"" due out april 2000. Buy it!"
5,Strong band Strong Vocals,I'm really pleased to find this on CD. I have the record. Maggie Bell belts 'em out - particularly Mr. Wizard - great party song. Plenty of celtic ballads also.
4,Very Good Treat,Have been usuing these for a few years. This product was very fresh and packeged nicely.
5,Hooray!!,"My children all loved this book growing up. My oldest son wanted a copy and I have had a difficult time finding it. I ordered it, it came in record time and the condition was as good as they said it would be."
3,they could of done better,"I am a big Bouncing Souls fan, and I have liked them for a while now and I have all their CD's,but when I bought this one I was dissapointed, it was basically just like every other CD they have come out with. Theres no new songs, and all the old ones sound really bad. I was not impressed, but I still love them, so I gave them 3 stars."
2,Capresso Stainless replacement coffee pot,I think this pot is a fine replacement except for one thing. I have recently realized the pot should NOT go in the dishwasher! That is why my original pot came apart. Wash by hand!
4,valuable book,"This is not light reading. These are some of the most challenging chapters I have ever read. But, they do have much to say, and they do challenge us all at places we need to be challenged.There is one chapter that should be popularly read. All pastors should thoroughly digest it for its value to their congregations. Everyone needs the insights gained from the chapter on comparitive ontologies (compairing what different religious systems believe). Woodfin outlines five topics, or questions to be answered by any of the world's religions. When you have these five in mind you can compare and evaluate any two or more religlions at their essence. You can appreciate the forest as opposed to being lost among the trees.This is, I think, fairly valuable knowledge in these days when all the wars are being attributed to what the participants believe. There are those avowed to kill us for not believing what they believe. Most of us don't know what they believe."
2,A review,"1. Run On (Extended) 2. Sunday 3. Down Slow (Full Length Version)I wouldn't reccomend this album. The extended version of ""Run On"" isn't much different from the original version, the full length version of ""Down Slow"" gets boring after awhile of listening to it (it's no wonder why he shortened it for the album) and ""Sunday"" is a pretty good song, but you can also get it on the maxi single of ""Bodyrock"" along with some great remixes of the title track and the B-side ""Sunspot""."
1,Mantra-mania,Disappointing. Way too much time spent in mantras not enough time spent doing yoga. Wish I would have known it was so mantra heavy...I would have passed on this purchase.
3,"OKAY, but no more","After discovering Reef a few years back i had been waiting for this record for ages. I wouldnt say this is a bad album but it isnt as good as ""Glow"" in my opinion. I bought this after only hearing ""i've got something to Say"" which is by far the best track on the album. there are some other good songs like ""new bird"" and ""Metro"".I just hope the next album lives up to the song ""Set the record Straight"", the first single from it."
4,Enjoyed this long-ago journey to Persia,"I just finished reading this book, which concluded our 2008 book club list. Like many of the books I'm reading these days, I'm sorry to have only now read this travel classic. What a pleasure it was to share Freya Stark's long-ago journey to the wilds of Persia. Although I share other reviewers' desires for ""more maps,"" I muddled through the first half of the book with one hand on my laptop searching Google Earth, trying to find the various kuhs and ruds she was describing.Still, I enjoyed the alternating sensations of anxiety and epiphany that even armchair travel can bring as I projected my own emotions onto Stark's efforts as she tried to figure out where in the world she was, find a meal or a place to sleep, and calibrate that difficult balance between physical safety and high adventure."
5,Very readable. Enjoyed the characters immensely,"Love this writer! Purchased this book after reading THE VIRGIN CURE. Both stories were easy to read and follow, or maybe I was just enjoying them so darn much. Her characters are beautifully developed and catches your interest immediately. I will be looking for more from this author."
3,an easy read,"I had high hopes for this book - midwifery, feminism, female relationships, beautiful location...but it was only ""okay"".I really enjoyed the ""Notes from the Willow Book"" at the end ~ a list of herbs and what they are used for. It added that little extra to round out the book. I felt that the characters could have been a little larger - a little less flat. The author seems to make an attempt occasionally at magical realism, but it doesn't really work.Otherwise it's not a bad book, it was interesting to read about a small, isolated community and how they reacted to situations and changes. To remember that females didn't have as much say as they do now.I would recommend anyone to read it, because it is a good read, just don't expect anything overly deep."
1,Incredibly Disappointing,"I heard about this book in the Fall of 2006 on a Midwifery discussion board and had looked forward to reading it.Unfortunately, this is one of those rare books I regret reading. The writing was immature, overly dramatic, and major portions of the book lacked unity. Random and improbable historical events/figures were peppered throughout the book, further weakening the narrative.What I was most upset about was the poor understanding that the author held of midwifery and contemporary obstetrics of the period. The narrative on both of these subjects was histronic and digusted me.My degrees are in History, Public Health, and soon Nurse-Midwifery. I found this book an incredibly poor portrayal of Midwifery, its roots in history, and in women's lives. Simply an awful book."
2,Not that good,"I had just read The Virgin Cure by Ami McKay, which I liked, and thought The Birth House sounded good. I was wrong. The Birth House just never reeled me in and I found sections of it quite slow, I barely made myself finish it. Don't waste your time on this book."
5,Good read,"I enjoyed this book, characters were real, story was engaging. A little bit of history and Canadian backdrop made it even more worthwhile. This is one I have recommended!"
2,disappointing,"I was interested in the locale and topic of this book, but found it to be only o.k. As some other reviewers have noted, the characters are VERY one dimensional, and the writing seemed self-conscious and over the top. Although the topic was interesting (divide between midwives and doctors), it didn't make up for the characters, writing, or even the plot for that matter. Although Geraldine Brooks' book ""A Year of Wonders"" isn't even about midwives per se, I thought she did a much better job of illustrating that conflict between the traditional medicine and uppity doctors backed by dubious science!"
4,A poignant step back in time,"This book took me back to a much simpler time. It is set during the time of the First World War in rural Nova Scotia, Canada. The characters are unbelievably real, and the book is very well-written indeed. I feel like I know these women and their heartaches and their joy. Choices for women were limited here, but you can tell that change is in the air. Women are wanting to start to take charge of some things in their life, such as where and how they want to give birth to their babies. The book is very compassionately written, and McKay keeps the plot going throughout. I felt like I was there with these wonderful, brave women and I was sorry to have the book end. It is a wonderful book!"
4,"Should have been in the ""100 Best""","Forget the formulaic ""Best Of"" collection, stick with the Limited Edition. This album reminds us of the best years of this band's life. And better yet, showcases the B-sides, which often outshined the single getting the airplay. It misses the 5-star mark for me because it wastes valuable track time on singles that were not emblematic of the band's best work. But it gets extra points for including a secret track at the end of Disc One, one of the all-time great U2 pieces that didn't get the airplay it deserved."
5,Brilliant music!,"I love listening to the gritty Irish voices of U2 they're great to listen to whatever mood you're in. I have all their albums (including imports), but this compilation CD is by far the best. Nothing beats a live performance but this CD comes close. My favourite song is ""Angel of Harlem"". I would definitely recommend this album to any U2 fan, new or old. Buy it now!"
3,"Great songs, disappointed by the B-Side disc","As a diehard U2 fan that has all their CD's, this was a bit of a disappointment. The collection of songs for the Greatest Hits portion was perfectly fine, but the B-Sides compilation (which was the reason to buy the disc) was a letdown due to the material chosen.Almost all the B-Sides were taken from ""The Joshua Tree"" and ""Rattle and Hum"" singles (which are readily available) and none from the really early days.It would have been better to include earlier period music such as ""Another Day"", ""Touch"", ""A Celebration"", and the U2-3 EP in the collection since none of that material is available on CD3."
5,absolutely awesome! A rollercoaster of love songs that rock,"I love this CD! The first disc is done in perfect sequence to take you through U2's first ten years of music. Listening to the second CD (the B-tracks) is like finding gold at the end of a rainbow. I got goosebumps from listening to ""Everlasting Love"" and ""Unchained Melody."" Those two tracks alone make the 2 CD's worth purchasing. I'm an avid U2 fan, however my opinion is shared by my girlfriend who doesn't normally like them. The continuity of how the songs flow together just adds to the listening experience. In closing I'll offer two words of advice-buy it!!"
5,A Tribute CD to the Best Band in the World,"First let me start out by saying that never before have I ever witnessed this much talent as these musicians in my life. With such talent as Larry Mullen on the drums, Adam Clayton on bass, ""The Edge"" Evans on guitar and BONO as the vocalist this truly has created one of the best ensembles the world has ever seen. With this track starting out with the solid ""Pride, In The Name Of Love,"" it takes you back to the Unforgettable Fire Album with the reassurance that this was one of the first songs that you heard from the band that started the road that they've taken us down. Other tracks like ""With or Without You"" and ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" make you realize that this compilation CD was well awaited for. The energy and the sex appeal that has been put off by this band is truly unique and definitely keeps you crying for more. I am anxiously waiting for the Best of U2 '90 CD due out in the Spring. Please keep promoting this band, they are very well desrving of it."
4,The B-sides are very good,After listening to these two cd's I have a new admiration for U2. There music is pretty diverse and very easy to listen to.
5,The Best Band on Earth,"I've just bought and listened to this CD and really made me shiver... I've been a U2 fan since I have memory...and this CD surely accomplishes what every real fan wants to listen all the way... Although U2 nowadays has changed it's style with POP, it still made me cry with their songs and lyrics. If your'e a real fan YOU'VE GOT TO BUY THIS ONE! Side B is another story... it fills your veins."
5,U2 the band of the 80's,Anyone who wonders who was the greatest band of the 80's need only to listen to this album.
4,"It's good, but could've been better.","I've been a U2 fan since I first saw the band on the ""Boy"" tour. As much as I loved this ""Best of.."" collection, I couldn't help be a little mystified about a couple of things. Thing #1: ""Why wasn't ""Gloria"" from the ""October"" album included? It's a wonderful and vibrant song. Thing #2: Was it really necessary to include two versions of ""The Sweetest Thing""?I look forward to the day when U2 puts out a boxed set. That way we can hear the great post 1990s music, as well as (hopefully) some live tracks."
5,Long Time U2 Fans Already Knew This...,"What do I do with all the CD Singles I collected which are now obsolete? Long Time U2 Fans always new this material was 5-stars, but I guess now the rest of the world knows our secret. New fans will like this set, old fans probably already own the material on it."
5,The B-sides is excellent for those who really enjoy U2.,"The CD is a great complation of all the early hits of U2. For those of us who have been fortunate enough to attend the early concerts, the music will bring back many memories of the rising popularity of U2."
3,B-Sides the only reason...,"Having followed and been a U2 fan since their break into the American airwaves, my wife and I are a little disappointed in this 'collection' of 80's songs. 'Rattle & Hum'was a great album but we think there was too much attention to it considering that 'Boy' and 'October' really proved this band to be different from all the bands at the time. U2 really defined the music of the time by providing killer guitar and excellent drum work behind Bono's provoking vocals. The B-Sides really are the gem in this collection. U2 fans should love this and fans new to U2 will find this set enriching. However, one song we are suprised that was not on there was '11 0'Clock Tick-Tock'. What happened? Not a bad collection; but overall it could have been better."
4,U2: Always challenging its audience,"I'd give this collection ****1/2 stars, and not 5 only because I *already* have all these tunes! I have been a real fan of U2 since my senior year in college (1981) & have bought up all their albums and most of their CDsingles where the b-sides resided. Nonetheless this is an awesome body of work; it's just that I've heard it all before already.I would like their next project to be like Springsteen's ""Tracks"" or Dylan's ""The Bootleg Series Vol 1-3""...you know, the unreleased stuff...the outtakes. The Beatles did this to great effect (the 3-part ""Anthology"" series) and I'm still waiting for the Stones.Still this is great for all the younger U2 fans, but again for an old fart like me, show me something I haven't heard, Bono, Edge & co!"
4,great but imcomplete!!!,"This is a wonderful collection of some of U2's greatest songs, but when i listened to it i noted something was missing: their best work from Boy, October and War was not included!!To a devoted U2 fan, these are some of their best works and need to be expressed that way!!!!other than that complaint, the Cd was pretty good and is recommended"
5,Just Plain Good Music,"I am by no means a big U2 fan. This is the only U2 album I own, so I don't know what is or isn't included on this compilation, but the music is great. It begins strong with ""Pride"" and ends with what I consider one of the greatest masterpieces of music history, ""All I Want is You"" If you let the CD run for a minute after the last song ends, you will hear ""October"" a short-but strangely powerful song. I don't know anything about the band, but I do know good music, and this is some of the best music I've ever heard."
1,A record company meddles with greatness.,"I'm just wondering why a CD like this had to be made-- and the purpose of forgetting so many influencial and popular U2 tracks. As far as greatest hits go, what about their early hits from the early days: CBS' ""Stories for Boys,"" ""Celebration,"" ""Electric Co,"" ""Gloria,"" ""Fire,"" ""Two Hearts Beat as One,"" and the encores of almost every early concert: ""40""?I'd be the first one in line if this compilation made any sense, or if it concentrated on one thing and did it well. Give us a really good, complete compilation of B-sides OR a ""best of"" compilation. But don't give us a half-assed attempt and then try to sell us a ""new"" old song!I also find it interesting that Island Records is beginning to realize how alienated older U2 fans are feeling with the new stuff, and stooped to catch our interest this way."
3,Disappointed,"From a fan who goes all the way back with them to 1979, I was disapponted. Most of these songs already appear exactly (as recorded) on prior albums. If they were going to include these, at least put a ""live"" or re-mixed version of the song. 5 Stars for the B-side flips...could have put these all on one CD...-2 stars for the re-hashing of the same songs as on prior albums."
5,Why didn't U2 release these songs long ago! B-sides rock!,"Great album, I think it was a wonderful idea to release songs from the eighties that no one has heard. The greatest hits were predictable, but still awesome."
3,What fans are really hungry for,"Its clear many have different views on what the 'greatest hits' were. This album is a must have if you have a small collection of old albums. But a waste if you are pretty complete and have collected B-sides (thus the 3 stars). I think a band like U2 could put out an album 'greatest hits never heard on the radio' to dig out the gems many haven't heard. I also think a tour of the great old songs is long overdue maybe ""nostalgia tour 1999 - for the fans""."
4,nearly complete,"Considering that I own most of the U2 CDs, the B sides CD was the only reason I bought the set. It was worth it. However, the first CD was missing some really good songs. Where is Gloria? If October hadn't been placed as the hidden song, that whole album would have been overlooked. While the Joshua Tree was amply represented, ""In God's Country"" still should have been included."
5,Awesome group of b-sides...,"I've got all the original albums that have the big hits, but this is a treat to be able to get so many b-sides on one CD.My only complaint is that ""Lady with the spinning head"" was not included. In my opinion, it's one of their best songs ever and definitely should have been included here."
5,about time the B-side were re-released,They shouldn't have put out the first disk unless they are all live. The B-sides however and remix of the sweetest thing (which is receiving radio air time now) is a GREAT idea. The B-sides are not typical B-sides. These songs could have easily replaced (except the cover songs) any song on the released album. Definitely worth buying. Another timeless classic from a great band.
5,The boys are back,"I was thrilled when I heard about the release of this double CD shot, but my expectations were far surpassed when I had a chance to listen to them. Was there a question of the quality that would be contained on Disk one. All the favorites are there and bring back some great memories. The boys could have stopped here and I would have been a happy U2 fan, but they doubled the pleasure with Disk 2. All the b-sides are awesome. They solidify the case that U2 should be considered one of the best bands ever. The limited edition set is a must in any CD collection. THANKS GUYS!!"
4,The B sides are amazing..,"The B sides CD is so relaxing, it's simply amazing. It's worth getting it, believe me. Of course the first CD is amazing as well, but listen to ""luminous times (hold on to love)"" ""walk to the water"" ""endless deep"" on the B sides, they are such great songs. You won't regret purchasing it."
5,Best Of A Sides & B Sides,"Until you pick up yourself a CD Recordable Drive, this will have to do.. =:>) The Earlier Best of U2 that you wish you had, but the real gem is all of the B-Sides that you would have had to buy all of the singles to get. Most of these have been played on the radio at one time or another, even the B-Sides. If you already have all the U2 albums like I do, you can scrap the first CD but keep the 2nd and it's still worth it."
5,Excellent,Much more than a greatest hits collection. Allows the listener to hear sides of U2 that are rarely heard.
5,Excelent! Superb collection of U2 masterpieces.,"This CD offers to the listener the best music ever performed by U2. It's also a recommendation for the one that doesn't know U2, because it shows the group's best songs."
3,"Some A moments, some B moments","I was interested in a U2 collection. I expected the 2CD collection to be great. Well, great it is to some extent. The gems are on disc 1, and still some are missing. Disc 2, in my view, is for die-hard collectors only. I doubt one can listen to that CD more than a few times. No memorable material here. So for the newcomers, save your pennies and stick to the single CD. Paul LeBoutillier, Rimouski (Quebec)"
5,Love these Almond Rocas!!,Brown & Haley Almond Roca's are delicious!!! I've given these as gifts to many close friends and family and they all seem to like it a lot. Highly recommend to those who have a sweet tooth!
4,"Although it's not Rich singing, it's worth listening to.","I had high expectations about this album ever since I heard of it's release. So when I finally purchased the long-awaited CD-I was taken back quite a bit. Awesome God: Tribute to Rich Mullins was not what I expected. Smitty's version of ""Awesome God"" will send chills up your spine and this version includes a beautiful piano ballad at the beginning. As the album continues, the artists offer a very appropriate and well-done version of the song they picked. Notables include Chris Rice's ""Calling Out Your Name"" and Kevin Max's ""Save Me"". Amazingly, 3 songs appear from Rich's very first CD(Billy Sprague &Gary Chapman&Kevin Max). With the exception of Amy Grant's ""Hold Me Jesus"", each track reminds you who the author of these remarkable songs was!"
4,"This is good stuff, God stuff.","I looked at the other reviews and see that Rich Mullins fans are disappointed. This posthumous collection was my introduction to Rich Mullins and now I am a fan. I will be listening to his work, recorded by him.Musically this is straightfoward and easy to grasp. Spiritually, for this Christian, almost every song hits the bulls eye."
3,"""Awesome God"" is disappointing but worth purchasing.","I am a huge Rich Mullins fan and was excited when this album was finally released, but I was disappointed when I first heard it. However, there are a couple of really good tracks -- especially if you are a Caedmon's Call, Jars, or Smitty fan. Each rendition of their favorite Rich song is excellent. Even though I had hoped for more, if you are an admirer of Rich Mullins, ""Awesome God"" is worth your money. -- Chris"
2,What kind of tribute did you have in mind?,"This is a disappointing album in the same way that The Jesus Record was. Ultimately, Rich's own distinctive voice and phrasing said as much about his beliefs and his passion for every word he wrote as the literal meaning of the words themselves. It is amazing how much less impact each song has through another person's interpretation. With The Jesus Record we didn't have much choice: in order to get a quality recording it had to be redone. But what is the point here? Each of these songs already exists in high-quality Mullins recordings. The tribute is the equivalent of saying, ""We know that your particular voice and phrasing is not marketable to some of the mass of Christian blandness, but we'll fix it."" It is an insult to Rich's artistic direction. A better tribute would have been for these artists to reflect on the themes of Rich's life with orginal works, honoring his distinctive voice with their own artistic visions."
2,it doesn't taste like pumpkin,"It's not overally strong, which is nice, but I only taste the spices. It doesn't taste like pumpkin at all."
5,Great stuff!,"This is a great, versatile product! My order came very quickly and in time for pumpkin spice martinis at my Fall party."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I love the Dunkin Donuts pumpkin coffee and pumpkin spice latte, so I asked for pumpkin syrup for Christmas and received this as a gift. I was incredibly excited, until I tasted my coffee. At first, I thought my milk had gone bad, because the coffee just tasted unpleasant and odd. I tossed the coffee and poured a new cup, adding milk from a different container, and was met by the same putrid taste.To me, the syrup tastes like rotten squash/pumpkin. I didn't taste much (or any) spice, though that may have been the overpowering smell of something spoiled. I tried several proportions of coffee:milk:syrup and could not come up with anything palatable.I strongly suggest you do not purchase this product, unless I got a terrible batch (in which case, Torani needs to tweak their quality control process!)."
5,It as pumpkin spice NOT PUMPKIN PIE.,"Very good syrup, but if you expect it to taste like pumpkin you are not reading the name close enough.They do make a PUMPKIN PIE syrup i have never tried."
3,Mild pumpkin flavor,"This is a good, clean tasting syrup with mild pumpkin flavor. It does not, by itself, replicate the flavor of the pumpkin spice latte from *bucks, but it tastes good and is a nice seasonal flavor."
3,Yummy Syrup keep shopping,"This syrup is a terrific product! It has just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. Instead of having to wait for Starbucks to bring it back out in the fall, you can make your own Pumpkin Spiced Lattes at home! However, you can get this exact bottle of syrup on the Torani website for literally HALF the price! The bottle is 7.95 and the shipping is 5.95. You do the math."
4,Pumpkin Syrup,I enjoy a pumpkin flavor with my coffee. Before I had to wait till September or the holidays to get that type of coffee.
1,Writing all over,"I was disappointed upon receiving this book to see that it is totally marked up and written on. I bought it hoping that I could make photocopies of certain pages...but unfortunately...I will have to RE-TYPE many of the writings, which was a huge disappointment."
2,there are better magazines to get,"I know APR is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there, and I think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine, but it's more of the National Enquirer of poetry magazines. It's a large, newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles. You'd be better off subscribing to Poetry, The Hudson Review, The Texas Review, Tar River Poetry, or any number of other journals."
1,Poetry Review,"I've been reading this magazine for years. The poetry is usually awful. The writers are terrible and boring. The articles are OK usually. It's too academic and it needs more down to earth poets like the slammers and those who just read and write poetry, not just academics. Whatever.Billy Perrault"
5,Great Book,I llike to thank the seller for a wonderful job of sending the book and in a great condition. I also ordered two more books from them just recently for the execellent service they provided. I highly reccommend them.
4,4 1/2 stars,"See synopsis above.Ben Kincaid returns as Bernhardt's likeable protagonist. An outstanding attorney that somehow gets by, even though he doesn't ever seem to make money.Kincaid and his sidekicks--you gotta like Loving and his crazy conspiracy theories--whoop it up again in a very enjoyable legal/suspense thriller. I think this is one of Bernhardt's best. A gripping storyline written in a style that will draw you in.Highly recommended."
4,"Read it, ponder it, implement it...","This is a powerful book about the rationale of a moral philosophy. For all of you who are not familiar with Kant, he is by no means an easy read. If you plan on getting this book plan on being engaged fully in the book. Some of the thoughts reveberate in your mind for months afterword. Kant breaks it down to pure logic and sets forth a notion of the categorical imperative. Check it out if you are into thought... and lots of it."
4,A fantastic displayer of emotion!,The Avengers Original Score provides feeling for every moment in the movie. The movie was absolutely terrible but John McNeeley's score lived up to many expectations. A brilliant recording although not quite good enough to tip the final star.
1,Refund,I have not received my refund for this purchase. The disk had only music on it -- no video.Please check on this. Thanks.Jane Stowe

HenryThurlow's Ghost Story by John Kendrick BangsThe Man with the Brown Beard by Nathaniel T. Babcock
2,Nothing new.,"I read about this book in an article (perhaps in the New York Times). I love reading about memorialization and other people's opinions of funeral directing/services. The book was a little bland. It's nothing I haven't read about before. I would perhaps recommend it to someone who knows nothing about the subject, but for someone who makes a hobby out of reading such material, there's nothing new here."
4,Strong Finish,"Peter Robinson's Close to Home is an excellent crime/suspense novel that actually gets stronger as it goes along. The novel concerns the unexplained deaths of two teenage boys, over thirty years apart. Inspector Banks returns home from a Greek vacation to deal with the discovery of the bones of one of his old classmates who had been missing since the mid-sixties. The story of this murder is juxtaposed with the story of a young man who has disappeared and is soon discovered dead. The novel is full of suspense and plenty of red herrings. It's an enjoyable read, especially at the end. Frankly at the start I was a little wary. I've read a couple newly-discovered bones mysteries lately, and wasn't exactly searching for another, but this one keeps getting stronger as it goes along to its satisfying finish. Enjoy."
4,Another good one from Robinson,"I enjoyed this one much better than the author's Aftermath.There are actually two investigations in this book - one in the present and one thirty years before. Although the ending is not a cliffhanger, it's a good read, especially if you are following the Inspector banks series."
4,Formula Robinson But Still Gripping,"After you've read several Robinson books you deduce pretty soon who the murderer is -- or, more accurately, who it isn't. Robinson is a journeyman writer and he does a very good job of laying out a fine story before you. His characters are always well-developed and interesting, his settings are always well-described, and he weaves in enough philosophy, poetry, and culture to add lustre to the book but not weigh it down. But, as the plot unfolds, the formula kicks in and there are few surprises. Which is okay -- one does not read English police procedurals for slam-bang excitement and surprises. I really like Robinson's book and Alan Banks is becoming one of my favorite characters. So, as long as Robinson keeps writin' 'em, I'll keep readin' 'em."
2,you call this wordy story a thriller? give me a break,"good writer, but pathetically lengthy and wordy. snail paced story with no climax or surprises at all. read like a nostalgia of an old man's blahblahblah. the author unnecessarily put his own hobby of collecting and listening to old songs into play with the bore-to-death bland story of two murder cases not thrilled in the least. the main character, banks, of this series is just a mediocre copper and actually did not help solving the murder cases but got beaten up and got laid once. and if you could call this a novel of suspense and felt suspended during watching, you definitely never got on a roller-coaster so far in your life. fire your no-brain editor next time and hire one who could slash your original script at least 200 pages, save some papers, save some time waste for the readers. to me, any reviews over 3 stars were just falsely over-rated. this is a novel uninspired, uninteresting, and most of all, too unimportant to give a review."
5,More about this Sampler CD,"This collectible 1988 CD has 13 songs previously released on various earlier albums. It was issued by EMI in a very substantial slimline jewel case. The total time is 44'35""."
4,using tools,I'm satisfied with this product that enabled me to adjust the band of my watch without difficulty.
5,Jeep Rear Lockable Storage,"Solves an issue for lockable storage in the CJ/YJ/TJ series. Removed seat and use this box. Great with almost full use of all available space + able to put boat seat cushions on top for extra seating in a pinch. Holds all winch stuff, tools, etc..."
5,Master of the heroic singing,"Vezzani had truly one of the finest heroic voices among the French tenors. His interpretation of Jean de Leyden (Roi du Ciel) is excellent. His voice was very strong,with a huge rage, but he could soften his voice (see his first aria from Manon). This is a superb recording, practically no of the contemporary tenors can compare with Vezzani. He never shouted, there's no cry like Villazon or Licitra."
5,This video is a hit in our house.,"Not only does my 18 month old love this video, my 4 year old does too. Finally a video they can watch together. They love the barn dance at the end. I really like how the shape starts out as a simple black shape and then becomes part of a fun animation. This teaches my 4 year old how to find shapes in every day settings. This is now one of his favorite games. And the repetative style of all the videos in this series is no doubt how my daughter learns from them."
3,mixed opinion,"I bought the Numbers and Letters videos after reading an Ad in a magazine with many awards given to this product. I also read the Amazon reviews.But I must say, after 5 minutes of viewing with our almost 3 year old, she kept saying ""turn it off"", I don't like it. I thought it was a bit annoying, but hoped she would enjoy it. She loves Dora,Sesame Street, Dan Zanes,Backyardigans,Blues Clues, etc....I don't Know?"
2,Boring!,"I don't get why the front of this DVD has so many awards. This DVD is so boring it should be shown to put kids to sleep. This video should be used to train chimps the english language. No songs, no fancy graphics, no fun. It basically shows you the letter on the TV, says the letter, then moves on. Boring. Go back to Elmo or whatever your kids like to watch."
5,Great learning videos!,My 3 yr old & 1 1/2 yr old absolutely love these videos. They have both learned so much by watching them and prefer to watch these over any of their other DVD's. I highly recommend these for toddler age and preschoolers. You'll be surprised at what your child learns and remembers from these videos.
2,wildwest2005,The book arrived in a timely manner but was in very poor condition. There was a lot of pencil marks that the seller could have erased.
5,Table of Contents,"The authors stated on the page ""Table of Contents"" the following: ""The testing program to accompany Chez nous Branche sur le monde francophone provides a quiz for each chapter section (Interrogation ecrite), two versions of each chapter test (Examen A/B), and two versions of each cumulative written exam (Examen final A/B) and oral exam (Examen oral A/B)"".It is not bound, comes in loose sheets. Here are chapter titles with corresponding page numbers: Chapitre 1. p. 1; Chapitre 2, p.13; Chapitre 3, p.25; Chapitre 4, p.39; Chapitre 5, p.55; Chapitres 1-5 Examen final, p.69; Chapitres 1-5 Examen oral, p.87; Chapitre 6, p.99; Chapitre 7, p.115; Chapitre 8, p.131; Chapitre 9, p.147; Chapitre 10, p.163; Chapitres 6-10 Examen Final, p.179; Chapitres 6-10 Examen oral, p.195; Scripts, p.205; Answer key, p.225"
4,Glad I could replace my missing piece,"I ordered this serving spoon to replace my original spoon that went missing. It arrived promptly as promised.My original Michelangelo set was given to me in 1976 & made in the USA. This spoon looks like it but the weight is lighter. Too bad it's not American made anymore. There is a difference in quality.However, I'm glad I was able to find a replacement."
5,essential,"this book is the one that got me through school in the 50's and 60's it's just that wonderful and enduring. it answers every grammatical question with examples and explanations. it's an essential tool especially now in a world full of technology. as we've grown in the ease of communication, the grammar has declined and THIS book solves that problem. it's a Godsend. should have ten stars!"
1,Disappointed with GPS Streetfinder,"Although it looked very promising, I found this product disappointing to say the least. The instructions are virtually non-existent. You are on your own when it comes to figuring out to make it work (I'm very good at this stuff, and I haven't been able to get it going. Also, if your Palm Pilot IIIe is relatively full of data, you'll never have enough memory to run this program. It might work alot better with a Palm Pilot IIIxe. Rand McNally should know better. This is like putting out an atlas without legends or an index."
1,Fatal Alert ! CRASH and BURN,"been working on this GPS for about 2 full days, it did work for about 15 mins halfway into the first day but then crashed with a fatal alert blitter.c.line 4867 unimplemented then demands a reset. tried everything, including updated verisons of palm 3.5, hotsync, and streetfinder2000 patch I am able to get it to crash much quicker now (before it took 25 mins of looking for a gps connection before it would crash) the program crashes anytime you zoom, move the screen, or try to use the GPS I do like the nice neat compact design that snaps to the palm, but this does not do me anygood if it wont work."
1,bad design,"Do not buy this GPS. It is a nightmare of craftsmanship. Not only it takes years to lock on to satellites, it loses signal quite often. The street finder software is good for nothing. It generates huge maps and takes long times. The physical properties of this GPS are not good either. It is made of soft plastic that breaks with minor stress. Mounting a plam on a GOS is not a good idea. When the car moves, using stylus becomes quite a challenge. Deserves zero star."
2,Manual for how to Use GPS for Palm III,I have now had the GPS for the Palm III for a month and still not able to make it work! Help desk is only open M-F 8-5 and thus not able to call to get much help as you need to be outside and talk to them to see if it is working.The first thing I had to do after loading the software on the computer was to download an update to the software. Still have never been able to make it work. Instructions are very poor.Guess this Is why there are only 2.5 stars!
2,No way,"Went to local place to check out hands-on. I was not impressed at all. The thing just felt cheap. I could not imagine playing it for long. It was not fun to hold and parts looked cheesy. Other than body shape, it was nearly identical to the Epiphone SG-Special Electric Guitar sold at the same price.I am surprised the Les Paul name was allowed to be used on this."
3,OK But I Prefer Vanity Fair,"These panties are OK, but I bought Vanity Fair at the same time and MUCH prefer them. They are better quality and fit better."
3,Red Krayola - 'Fingerpainting' (Drag City),"Okay,so-so late '90's effort by the highly experimental, eleven piece (on this title, anyway) band. Tunes here I thought were somewhat entertaining were ""There There, Betty Betty"", the rather upbeat ""Mother"" and the fifteen-minute ""Out Of A Trombone That Is Divided"". Like all their other releases, 'Fingerpainting' merely showcases the Red Krayola's tendency to create such off-the-wall arrangements and {sometimes} noisy playing. Definitely an acquired taste."
2,Maybe I'm not burned out enough to appreciate this,"I have a few Red Krayola albums. Some are better than others, but based on my informal survey, they deserve their status as unknown underground runners-up. They offer nothing that hooks you in, at least not to these ears. I like Alex Chilton at his worst, I like Jandek at times, but this just sounds like aimless noodling by people who may not be either talented or intense. Tony Williams it's not.There's a guy who camps out under the overpass near my place in LA. I imagine something akin to this album running through his sun-baked head all day long. He looks menacing at times, but he really couldn't get it together to attack you, so don't worry."
5,Three Top Basketball DVDs! Dynamic & Creative!,"If you are looking for individual or team drills, look no further.These 3 programs offer some of the most exciting basketball drills I haveever seen. We provided our league with them and our coaches and parents have given asvery positive feedback.Marty Schupak also produced popular DVDs in other sports available on Amazon.Baseball Coaching:The 59 Minute Baseball PracticeFor Little League coaches & parents.Soccer Coaching:Championship Soccer DrillsFor soccer coaches & parents.Ice Hockey Coaching:Championship Hockey DrillsFor ice hockey coaches & leagues.Golf Instruction:Backyard GolfFor golfers looking to improve their game.Lacrosse Coaching:Backyard LacrosseFor Lacrosse coaches & players."
5,Rock and roll where did you go???,"This is rock and roll. If you are familiar with the genre and like it, this will amaze you."
2,Syrian/Lebanese version ... should be made clear,"From the very first words that came out of the narrator's mouth ... ""you are speaking to a woman from Syria..."" I knew this was usless for me. Anyone who's into Arabic in the slightest degree first learns that the most common forms are Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Arabic. So to advertise a program as only 'Basic Arabic' is beyond deceptive. Also, as everyone knows with Pimsleur you don't have any written material. I don't understand why they won't incorporate that into the programs. Arabic is hard enough to mimick with all the glottal sounds without considering doing it with no written reference. Cheapskates I guess. Anyway its a good technique IF you want to learn SYRIAN arabic or have a glossary with you to search every word used which goes against the convenience of listening in the car."
4,Good Product,"Is easy to use. Teaches basic Arabic, will not teach you to be fluent if you have no background but does help with learning to speak the language and understanding the flow of the language. Good for long car rides."
2,underwear feels weird,This short has an underwear liner that feels rather strange. I am going to return these.
4,Cake toppers,i didnt get a chance to use them but im planning to use them for my other baby girls bday party. its very nice.
4,A great book,This book compiles a treasure trove of information in one handy reference.An excellent idea that should be updated for today.
1,I Agree with First Reviewer -- Disappointing,"Before you buy this Robert B. Parker Companion, my advice is to go into your local bookstore and find a copy on the shelf. Skim through the book and see if it's worth paying full price for.This rather slim volume simply isn't worth the money, in my opinion. The biography/interview with Parker is brief (you can read the whole thing in less than a few minutes) and far inferior to what you can find on the internet for free. The outlines of the books and characters are pretty skimpy and uninteresting. If you're a hard-core fan, this book may be worth purchasing, but I think for the rest of us, it's just not a good investment. Again, there are fan websites that provide a lot of this information at no cost.I'm a big fan of Robert B. Parker, but I was disappointed by this book, which looked like a rush job. Parker deserves a better book that surveys his body of work."
1,"Buy a used copy, if you must.","Long on lists and short on meaningful commentary. I wasn't planning on learning the names of all of the people in Parker's various books, yet there are 116 pages devoted to exactly that. The character sketches trivialize the maturation of the main characters through the long writing history of Robert Parker, and much more could have been done, for example, with the growth of Hawk as a significant element of Spenser's life - book by book.If you must buy this book, I recommend getting a used copy, they are going for as little as $1.13 plus shipping as of this writing."
3,Classical music purists will probably hate it,"This CD features performances of ""beloved melodies"" (most from the classical repertoire) by The Classic Buskers (do a web search if you want to find out what busking is). I found this to be a light-hearted take on some well-known classical themes, usually played at a fast tempo and featuring the accordion plus one or more wind instruments. It's a bit of fluff when you want something light to listen to. Just don't take it too seriously."
4,Where' s the fish?,"This is a fun picture book for very young children. Children are encouraged to identify the fish that has left its fishbowl in various colorful environments, e.g., in a pot of flowers, in a jar of candies, in a room of toys. It's cute and will be entertaining for the youngest of children."
4,Dang!,"For it's size and weight (very light), this device gets the job done. Frankly, I was amazed.K Murphy"
4,The size was just right,"After I ordered this item, friends told me that often times one cannot properly estimate the size of the gems by the fotograph and most of us have no idea how to breack down the total carat weight for the bracelet into the specific gem size. But the size of the saphires is nice, and the overall effect is wonderful."
3,Real time Civil War History,"Very detailed and complete chronological and narrative history of the Civil War written during the time of the Civil War. Vol. I published in 1863; Vol. II published in 1866.Written in a very readale style. Unlike many Victorian histories--it is not long-winded and meandering--especially off topic. The writer--Abbott--has a sense of what is important to the ages.I would recommend this book (1) to those who enjoy a good read, and (2) to those who want a reference book as companion to a Civil War history--so as to look things up or get a fuller idea of things. (3) to those who want to know what people thought at the time of the Civil War--as those events happened. It is an interesting insight to--what Wm Manchester referred to in his MacArthur bio--of the blinding experience of now. (I am parapharsing WM's idea--perhaps poorly). That Abbott and our country could see so clearly in the midst of blinding events--is remarkable and encouraging for today's events."
5,"MARAVILLOSA PELICULA, MARAVILLOSA MUSICA","ESTE DISCO QUE AUN NO TENGO PERO TENGO EL GUSTO DE CONOCER MUCHAS DE SUS CANCIONES ES MARAVILLOSO, ESTA PELICULA LA VI POR PRIMERA VEZ A LA EDAD DE 9 AÑOS EN UNA SEMANA SANTA POR TELEVISION, DE AHI EL PERSONAJE DE JESUS ME GUSTÓ MUCHO SE APEGA MUCHO A LA REALIDAD......ES HERMOSO.SALUDOS DESDE MÉXICO DISTRITO FEDERAL."
5,Beautiful Lovely Music!,The music on this cd is so beautiful. My favorite track on here is 1-Jesus Of Nazareth. I definetley recommend this to everyone! Maurice Jarre is one of the best composers of all time I think.
3,not as smart as they think,"Although they think they know it all they neglected to include a breed that was part of early americana,the Catahoula Leopard dog.This breed was brought over by De Soto to control the indians.It is the earliest breed of american dogs.They are a dog well known to Louisiana,Texas ,Okahoma.They are super intellegent and primarily herding dogs."
3,Prince Charming surely awaits,The Queen's curse is an alright book. it was a little slow but the novel flowed well. The use of magic was good and Piper's witt is hilarious. All in all if your a Charmed fan then read it.
5,Awesome reference!,"This is a very informative and easy to follow reference for cooking Italian foods. I love the explanations for cheese types, wines, espresso, herbs and etc. This really helps me to understand what products to buy and how to buy them. The information on reading the labels olive oil was eye opening. I have tried a couple of the recipes and they are yummy and simple. I am hooked on the Asparagus with Parmesan and egg! It sounded rather weird but I tried it and absolutely love it, especially when I am in a hurry and hungry. I am so glad I have this cook book as a resource."
4,Unique Vibrational Healing,"As a Holistic Practitioner, I recently became interested in what some have called ""vibrational medicine"". I found Beaulieu's unique observations into the world of sound, music and healing to be thrilling and his views have urged me to continue looking into the realm of sound. I have adopted some of his tenets into my consulting work. Information on voice energetics was most interesting; combining physiology with energy concepts, as was the chapter on tuning forks. A great read."
3,large boat mirror almost works as needed,I have a Bayliner deck boat and would like to see my grandchildren in the tow tube behind me. this mirror appears to be the right size but I had difficulty mounting it to my boat so that I could have a good view. It is mounted currently on the plexiglass screen in front of the steering wheel and provides a partial rear view but my own image gets in the way sometimes. takes a bit of fiddling with the three adjustment knobs to get it as well positioned as possible.
5,"7"" x 14"" Ski mirror","I have enjoyed using this miiror. It has a very wide angle of vision,perfect for water skiing,wakeboarding,tubing and other water sports. This mirror has help my neck,I have a tendency to want to watch the person I am pulling. Now I can see behind without constantly turning around. The mirror is as handy as a rearview mirror on a auto. It is easy to install and remove, fits perfect on my Tahoe ski boat. I leave the mirror on all the time, even when trailering to the river. It will stay in place, no constant re-adjusting. In Louisiana it is legal to pull a skier using the 7"" x 14"" mirror without having a spotter. I would not want to be without it now that I have gotten used to using it. HAPPY AND SAFE BOATING!"
1,Universal Boat Mirror,"Really disappointed in this mirror. Very heavy, very difficult to mount to standard boat window hardware, awkward to set the mirror. Would not recommend at all - can't use it on our standard 18' Chapparal speedboat. I wanted a larger mirror to see my kids skiing/wakeboarding while driving the boat - this mirror has spent the summer on the boat floor."
4,The models do look neat,This is a pretty good book. The the inside-outside look of these models is eye pleasing and the models are also very challenging. This is definitely not a beginners book. The only thing I did not like is the strange bases the models are built from. All in all a good advanced origami book.
2,American Standard of Poultry Perfection,This book features copied pictures in black and white which is not helpful when your trying to see what the book is describing. I would not have bought this book.
5,Introducing the hardline according to Terence Trent Dárby,I'd like to buy these cdwild card andintroducing the hardline etcby Terence Trent Dárby
4,A Must Buy,"If you remotely like any of his previous works (maybe with the exeption of Flesh/Fish) this should be in your collection. Every song is solid from beginning to end, with some truly exceptional poppy and/or funky gems. TTD also has one of the best and most distinctive voices in popular music. Its a shame (but predictable) that someone this good isn't more popular. I hope he tours to support this."
4,A very fine album,"In case you've read somewhere that TTD is a very arrogant man, well, this isn't about having beers with him but listening to his music. And what great music he makes!This latest album is a big surprise after many years of silence. A perfect string of 18 tunes, at least half of which are nothing less than awesome. This is timeless soul music with perfect hooks, pop sensibilities and inspired melodies; some of the tracks could actually be in the soundtrack of ""Jackie Brown"" - yes, they are *that* good.Last but not least, his voice sounds better than ever here.A wonderful record to start your mornings with."
5,TTD is back.,"TTD is back. I'm struggling with the thought that this latest offering by TTD might be better than ...Hardline. The voice is as dynamic as ever but with a more definitive edge if that's possible. It's unfortunate that we may never hear this incredible cd on the radio or see a video on MTV, BET, or VH1. Mavericks don't get to play with the other horses. I will not rate any songs because they are all of equal strength. If you like rock, R & B, Urban, or Cool-Out music you won't be lost on this CD. This will be the best CD you never heard. Get this one today."
5,Best TTD Album Yet,"This is an amazing album.Terence Trent D'arby or as he is now known Sananda Maitreya is a musical mastermind. Each song on this album has a depth and sound unlike any other performer. He mixes funk, rock, soul and spirituality in ways that not even Prince can match.If your a fan of TTD this album is for you. If your not yet a fan, you will be after you listen to this music unfiltered my the middle man-record industry... Honestly this is his best album ever. Buy this album and you will not be dissapointed. Stand out tracks are the funky sexy ""Designated Fool"". The soul searching of ""MY Dark Places"", the beautiful ""What Shall I Do"" and the unforgetable ""Sayin About YOu""....""I met TTD at his BB Kings Show In NYC and hung with him for about an hour...NOt only is he extremely humble and cool, but he is an amazing performer....."
4,The last TTD recording...,"This is an interesting CD in TTD's discography. Why? Cause it is the last CD where he uses his birth name and not his changed name of Sananda Maitreya. I feel this is the last recording he put out where the music feels and sounds like his 80's and 90's output. And that's a good thing. It sounds like Terence Trent D'arby. We know him. We don't know Sananda Maitreya. But there are some great songs in this set. There are some lesser lights too, what pop CD doesn't have them? Some of the gems are: The Inner Scream, What Shall I do?, Shalom, Girl, Ev'rything, Sweetness, Some Birds Blue...When I hear this CD it reminds me of why I love this guys music: his voice, his unique soulfulness, his musicianship and his eclectic nature."
3,good for beginners,"this camera is good for its money, and it has red-eye reduction, which is always a plus. it has easy film loading, which is also a plus. unfourtunately, it is does not take the highest quality pictures."
2,not so italian,"There is a really good reason why this dvd/video is out of print. it's really not very good. while it is well shot and does have beautiful scenes of Ferarri and the Italian Alps I was expecting more of the every day italian people. the best parts of this video was certainly the fishing village in Sicily but the rest shows very little of everyday italian life. most of this video is Ferarri and fashion models. A much better production and also by discovery is ""Discovery Atlas: Italy revealed"" which was produced in 2006. Actually the free dvd from Perillo tours shows more of italy and the italian people than this video does. finally I can't really figure out why some people are asking upwards of 60 dollars for this dvd. I finally bought mine for about six dollars and after watching it, even that was over priced."
2,not great,"I bought this expecting to see Italy and learn about Italian culture, but what I found was 20 minutes of ferrari commercial and the rest interesting, but too specific--about a few peoples' lives--fishermen, an underwater photographer, and a designer. I think I was expecting a more general view. It was like an IMAX movie at a museum that you watch once, like it, but never see it again. It was neat, but I definitely wouldn't buy it again."
2,This product did not work when we received it.,"Maybe I misunderstood how this doll was supposed to work however when my granddaughter opened it on Christmas morning, it just barely moved at all. I changed the batteries (thinking that would be it) however it was the exact same thing Needless to say, she was disappointed and just gave the doll back to me."
4,Another wonderful richard sharpe book,Everything I have read by Bernard Cornwell is engrossing and well written and well researched. I especially like to read the historical notes found at the end of the book and maybe someday I will be able to go to one of the battlefields he writes about.
2,worth a read as entertainment,"Assuming the historical facts as to which regiments did what to whom, I suppose this novel deals relatively fairly with the waterloo campaign. Somehow, however, it seems incredible to me that Richard Sharpe happened to be at every dramatic episode, from bringing the crucial message to the Bruxelles ball to charging the Guard in the end and always turning the tide at crucial moments. Seeing that Sharpe also instigated the crucial breakthrough at Vitoria, I can't wait to find out that he was also at Borodino, Leipzig and probably any french defeat you care to mention. Is he going to poison the exile at St Helena? Does Napoleon know Sharpe beat him almost singlehandedly, despite the incompetent british officers, cowardly spaniards and the perfidious prussians? Some limits to superheroes make them more believable. Some kryptonite to the french bulets, please????"
1,"""Merde"" book. I am dissapointed.","I think I have wasted my money. The number of errors is quite impressive, even as for a novel. You know already on the start who is loved and who is not, who belongs to the cute guys and who are the ugly boys.Sharpe himself is a cartoonish hero. One against ten, He Who Never Is Defeated, sort of a childish character.I am dissapointed."
4,Love sharpe,"If you like the Sharpe series, this one will not disappoint you. Several of the series plot lines are resolved, but more are created to keep the series interesting."
4,Great battle / Great book,"Nobody handles battle scenes better than Bernard Cornwell. His treatment of the Battle of Waterloo does justice to its significance as the final confrontation between the French under Napoleon and the alied European powers. Those who have not read all the other Richard Sharpe books might not appreciate the story's context so well, but anyone picking up the book with no prior experience of Sharpe could still derive immense pleasure from the complex action - the reversals of fortune in the continuous give and take between two huge opposing armies.Something that I did miss was a fuller rounding out of the story of Richard Sharpe himself. Having set up the Battle of Waterloo to be both a confrontation between European powers and between Sharpe and his estranged wife's lover, I was hoping for Sharpe to bring that chapter to a close rather than other forces intervening to do the job for him. Just not as much fun as having him wield the sord.And what about the money?"
3,Not for adults...,"I thought this was an adult helmet, but when I received the box it says ""Young Adults"". I guess my head was too big, but I did size and I have a 22.5"" head.Description says it fits up to 23.5"". but i'd say more like 20-21.5"".Great helmet though! Looks futuristic!"
4,"deep, deep house","if you're into mark farina, you'd probably like this one. especially with tracks like ""odu jazz"", etc..again, another great release from USG, who've had the heart to include their ""sunpower"" single. a bit pricey for the bonus track(s) though."
4,Danny champion of the World,"Danny Champion of the World is about a relationship between two people. Danny's dad tells him his deepest darkest secret. The secret is that he poaches. Danny and his dad are going to try and catch all 200 of Mr. Victor Hazel's pheasants. Do you think they will be able to catch all of the peasants?There are many reasons that Danny Champion of the World is a good book. One reason is that the characters are fantastic. Secondly, the book explains the entire settings well. Lastly, it has an awesome plot to go with the characters. I recommend Danny Champion of the World to 8 to 14 year-olds."
5,It was a very nice book.,"My son read this book. He enjoyed the story. he liked Danny's adventuresand the relatonship with his dad. The book was funny but i didn't like the fact that they glorified poaching. In the end , the poaching did not work out that well and they went on."
1,Appalling,"Dahl's writing talents far exceeded his ethics. This is a nasty, indecent book whose main themes are 1) rich people are evil, and 2) it's not only acceptable but charming to steal from them. I didn't know the story before reading it to my child, but now she has a lesson in class envy and the ethics of theft."
4,Danny Champion of the World,This was one of my favorite books of all time. I especially liked when a nine year old was driving a car.the one person I do not like is mean old Mr. Hazell.
2,Not one of his best...,"I'm a huge Roald Dahl fan, but I found this to be one of his weakest books; in essence, it teaches ""If someone isn't nice, it's okay to steal from him."" In addition, the story seemed rather uninspired; though the relationship with Danny and his father was touching, it seemed to wrap itself around a metaphor of dubious origin; father and son bonding over stealing & killing. I'd suggest the superior ""The Enormous Crocodile"" , or the quintissential ""james and the giant peach"", ""matilda"", or ""witches"" (my personal favorite) over this questionable entry."
2,Not that Great,Some people might not be interested in this book.The first time a read it it was great.The second boring.
2,Not Dahl's best,I really disliked this book. It was too much of a change from Dahl's children's stories. It really didn't appeal to me from the start. I encourage others to read Matilda or The BFG first.
5,An absolute joy! A classic.,"A wonderful book to read as a kid, or to read to your kid as an adult. The story is about Danny and his amazing dad (his mother is dead) and the wonderful hijinks they get into together. The plots they come up with are absolutely fabulous, and they involve a lot of pheasants. There are moments in here that were so happy that I literally cried. As a child, it was one of my two favorite books, along with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which I read 30 times). This gets my absolute highest recommendation, I'd give it 6 stars if I could!"
2,charming but overrated,"I read this to my seven year old son, and he enjoyed it. Dahl does have a gift for language, and the story about a young boy and the father who loves him dearly is very charming, made even more so by Quentin Blake's delightful illustrations.But, as I explained to my son, the story glorifies stealing (romanticized as poaching). It doesn't matter if the victim is a hideous, cruel human being who deserves a grand comeuppance, it's still stealing. Another point worth mentioning is that Danny, the young boy, is the most grown-up person in the cast of characters--he's the one who instinctively knows the right thing to do, while it's the impulsive adults who act like children. Good points to bring up with one's own children, if you're going to read this to them.The Roald Dahl Brigade surely will go after me for this."
4,If You Like Friendship This is a Great Book for You!,"Danny, the Champion of the WorldBy Roald DahlAre two heads better than one? Find out in Danny, the Champion of the World.Danny and his father live in a small caravan next to his father's business, the filling station. Mr. Hazzel is rude, greedy and rich; he owns all the property except one little piece. One night Danny and his father go out to take all the pheasants from Mr. Hazzel's property before Mr. Hazzel's shooting party can begin. Will Danny and his father catch all the pheasants in time? Find out in Danny, the Champion of the World.I like this book because it shows caring between Danny and his father. Danny and his father stick together like true friends. The pictures I see are in my mind; they're black and white but very detailed.The author tries to teach you that by sticking together, anything is possible. You should really read this book."
5,Still holds the magic years later,"I first remember this book from grade school and loved it then, 20 or so years later the magic still holds. It is a rare thing in this day of electronics to find some thing that holds a little one so well. I have read most of the author's other books and enjoy them, but as a Dad this one holds particular meaning and memories of my own father. While not a poacher he was the kind of guy to wake you up and whisper ""Don't wake Mom"" to show you something neat and to have our own private adventure. Whether it was the bugle of the elk or some other wonder for me to see. I eagerly await the time that I can do the same with my own son"
3,Okay,"The book is very very entertaining but it does seem to send wrong messages across. Children may get the impression that poaching is just fun, not a crime and not at all wrong."
5,"Danny, The Champion of the World- Review by Rebecca","Have you ever met a big, mean, rich man that owns a Rolls Royce? Danny and his father have. They live in an old caravan in the countryside in England. Finally Danny's dad tells him his deep dark secret about why he has been out so late at night. After Danny's father falls into a pit made by their enemy, he gets medicine to get well. Then Danny finds out that his dad hates Mr. Victor Hazell, so makes up a plan to ruin Mr. Hazell's big event. If you want to find out what Danny's big plan is, read Danny, The Champion of the World. I would give this book five stars because it had action and suspense."
2,Weak dragon weir,"This is not one of Storm's best. In fact,this is a confusing mix of conventional fantasy and arcane sex politics, full of loose ends and uncompleted scenarios. What's more, there isn't a single persona in the novel which I didn't find pityful, despicable or both...and who doesn't meet an horrendous death.If this is the FIRST book, I think I'll spare myself the other two."
4,The Beginning of An Addiction,"I got Sea Dragon Heir because it was on sale and ever since I have been searching for more books by Storm Constantine. This book is one of the best I have read in a long time....even though the brother/sister thing is a little disturbing.....I couldn't put it down until I finished it. It made me want to know more about the characters, their history and their futures. I have looked everywhere for more books by Storm and until now, have been unable to find them. The next book in the trilogy will be the next book I buy."
3,Author played with plot too much,"There are more than a few places in this novel where the author abruptly ""comes up"" with something that felt to me to come out of nowhere--the Chair, the ruins, the notion that a dead man is lost... I'm willing to suspend my disbelief, but I don't like feeling as if I'm being told to keep closing my eyes while something new is created. The ending in particular felt ""patched on"", as if to increase demand for a sequel. I expected the book to end--and it didn't.None of the characters were particularly likeable, and that didn't help either, although they were compelling.I wouldn't seek out other books by this author--it wasn't bad, but it wasn't strong enough to make me really want to read more."
4,Intriguing read,"I was probably just starved for a good read, but I enjoyed reading this book! It needs a bit of an open mind, but the plot kept me interested, and the characters were actually real for a change. None of the usual ""okay, she's pure, good and perfect, and she's really evil, bad and wicked"" that I seem to trip over again and again. As much as we like having characters that fit in little boxes, it's not very real is it? Oh and yes, it is definitely not something for young ones, but I'm not that old either.The only thing that kind of annoyed me about this book was the epilogue. Okay, since when do you introduce a new character in the last five pages? But other than that I don't regret picking up this book, it did what I expected it to, it entertained. I will definitely look for more Storm in the future."
2,Interesting stuff but no depth,"After reading the trilogy set, I can go back to this first book and safely say that Sea Dragon Heir is my least favorite of the three. I'm tired of being ""told"" what Valraven is rather being ""shown."" In fact a great many things are being told and hence the characters are barely flesh and bone and I didn't care about the melodramas going on in their lives. There are too many convenient plot devices that is contrived and tiresome. As for the bed-hopping scenes..... why? They don't seem to serve any other purpose other than to ""oh lets be shocking, shocking(!)"" and then left at that with no futher insights to the characters themselves. Once again it is the ""telling"" rather than the ""showing"" flaw of Constantine's writing that bores me to no end.I will say that Constantine's writing style is lovely and rather poetic. Too bad she waste it trying to be the next Anne Rice or something."
3,"""OK, I get the point...""","It is an informative and well-written book. For a lay-person interested in the origins of humankind, it is almost a must-read. The book is thorough, and use a multitude of well-documented sorces to back its claims. However, it is tarnished by an ever reoccurring tendency to throw punches rather than educate. After a while you simlpy get a little tired of this (""OK, I get the point. You don't care much for the multiregionalists!""). The thing is that personal attacks and slander do not belong in a book that claims to be scientific. Not even in the preface.In an otherwise excellent book, brace yourself for somewhat petty personal opinions!"
1,What a joke,"I agree that these women are not fashionistas. They are just women who watched too many Sex and the City and thinks they are authorities on fashion. I agree with another reviewer, I was shocked when I saw the photos of these women who you may picture at the local mall eating Taco Bells and shopping at JC Penny's. One of the authors need to lose some serious weight and let's be honest, being fashionable and looking great is hard when you are wearing a size 16.Buy it for the photos- you will get a good laugh!"
1,A slow year for poetry?,"As with any anthology of poetry, the content largely depends on the editor. However, from the wonderful introduction Jorie Graham provided, I expected an equally wonderful collection in a call of arms for poets to help poets realize what they do is equally valid as anything else a writer may write, be it fiction or non-fiction. Unfortunately, I had trouble finding even one poem that was more that just okay. Perhaps it should just be called American poetry of 1990. I would recommend the 1999 edition of this series over the 1990 edition."
1,disgusting,"I don't know how people can consider this ""contemporary music"", Garcia's pieces reveal a lack of talent and creativity, and they all put the listener to sleep. I am a music major who does listen to a lot of new music, but this is way too much, I want my money back..."
2,"weird, sometimes boring","After Morton Feldman's Coptic Light, we all are sort of tired of this wide-spread music. The performances in this CD are very good, though. Robert Dick does a great job in Music for Berlin -the smooth sound of the alto flute is specially delightful- The pieces for double bass are particulary boring, and 'Voces Celestiales' starts creating some interest, but doesn't go anywhere. I also wonder if Mr. Garcia ever studied counterpoint in depth... José Ramón Mendoza"
4,"Great humor, too bad dogs can't read!",I only made this a 4 star rating only because I wish they made this in a bigger size. The graphics and stitch work is top notch. It is non-slip which helps keep the bowls from sliding all over the place.
3,Extreme Max Racing Pro Sled Slides not Great!,"These things work great for moving around your snowmobile, but the plastic is too weak, and I have had a couple of the wheels pop loose and bend over. I was able to put them back in the wheel seating but there was some damage and eventually I may not be able to use them?Spend the extra cash for the metal Sled Slides!"
4,Guy meals on the grill,"This sturdy paperboard cookbook, presented by Men's Health magazine, is geared for guys who are novices at cooking and looking for easy meals to prepare on the grill. These 50 recipes, each of which is enhanced with ingredients out of cans, include beef, chicken, fish, pizza, pork, Spam, turkey, and veggies. Among the recipes are beer-can chicken, red-hot ribs, Dr Pepper-glazed ham, teriyaki turkey, and spuds on a stick.The main ingredients and the finished product are illustrated with photographs. The book includes nutritional information, tips on the art of grilling, and a generous dollop of humor. Some of these recipes might be a little tricky for the novice cook to prepare, considering the unpredictability of a grill's flames and heat level, but there are still plenty of foolproof meals here beyond basic burgers and chicken that are great for feeding (and impressing) guests.Eileen Rieback"
1,Not healthy at all!,Terrible - you can find all of these recipes on-line. They are mostly terrible for you too. Tons of salt.
4,"Great book, misplace pictures","I've had this book for a while and love the recipes! One slight problem though is pictures of cuts of meat are associated with the wrong name, or is it the other way around? For example, it says flank but the picture is top round, that sort of thing. Otherwise, it's great!"
5,BUY THIS ALBUM NOW,"EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM NOW, BEFORE THEY WILL GET SOLD OUT. BECUASE ONCE THESE GUYS GO BIG. THERE IS NO STOPPING THEM. I DON'T PERSONALLY KNOW STEVE O'REILLY (LEAD SINGER) BUT I'VE MET PEOPLE THAT HAVE AND THEY ONLY HAVE GREAT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT HIM AND HIS MUCIAL CAREER. THIS GUY HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE IT IN THE BIG LEAGUE."
5,YOU MUST BUY THIS ALBUM,"TAMMANY HALL IS AWESOME, I CAN'T BELEIVE THESE GUYS HAVENT GONE PLATINUM YET!!! THEY ROCK!!!...I heard there song 'Always on Sunday' played on ...a radio station) ... ONCE THESE GUYS GET OUT THERE, THEY ARE GOING TO BE A HUGE HIT FOR A LONG TIME!!!!"
5,Black rose beaming,"It's such a dainty and mysterious cocktail ring ! It's excatly the size, design and color I was looking for, and the price is also very practical when compared to high fashion designer prices of the similar design. Perfect for Valentine's and that very special date :)"
1,It be funny if it weren't so sad,"The state of the world is in no small part due to the simplsistic jingoistic ramblings that Kelly epitimized. The next time you see something about how terrible things in Iraq are, remember that Kelly was cheering the parade and deliberately urging ignorance over rational thought as we debated the wisdom of war.I'd say more, but I don't like condemning the dead all that much, and unfortunately, there will be a lot of ealy graves because Americans took Kelly's advice."
5,This Ain't No Blues Jam,"Okay, this release isn't as bluesy as the previous effort, but by the grace of God it is pure gold. It's still noisy, but this time there's a bit more of a rock influence, and with guys this talented you know that's a good thing.Rock has its roots in the blues, so this is a natural progression for 20 Miles, one of the more original bands out there that should be much bigger than what it is. When I say ""original,"" I don't mean original sounding. No, this is stuff you've heard before if you've studied music. By original, I mean 20 Miles is doing its own thing. Nobody else is doing this, and if they are, they aren't doing it this good.""I'm A Lucky Guy"" isn't just a song title. It's what you'll be if you find this."
2,Low quality,"I had to send these back after 3 days. The lock sticks after cutting each and every nail, very time consuming. Talked to the prez of Martha's Pet Place, he said Vista Series is the low-end of Miller Forges products, if your bent on getting Miller Forge, get their double-duck or red ones. They are better quality. I don't know why they continue to sell the vista series. I traded them for ""safari's"" and I deem them the best!!"
1,OKAY,"OKAY, just okay cause I thought it was stupid, waste of iCarly people.The premess was dumb, a KID can sign herself in to a crazy house.Yet to get her out a PARENt had to do it."
5,Fun for the family!,"My two tween daughters really love this show. The show features Carly, a girl in her early teens produces her own web show with the help of two friends: wild and crazy Sam (as in Samantha) and the boy next door, Freddie. Their antics on the webshow are entertaining to watch, but the real fun comes from watching these fairly typical teenagers interact with one another and their classmates.The absolute highlight is Carly's older brother, Spencer, with whom she lives. He is hilarious as he tries to walk the line between cool older brother and responsible guardian.This show may be written for tweens, but it is funny enough for adults. And a good clean show that the whole family can enjoy is a rare find indeed!"
2,The same as season 4?,"I have a question. Why are the season 5 episodes also on the ""Complete season 4"" dvd? Which season are we in...4...or 5?"
5,A great experience.,"I never thought I'd find a country band I liked, but this one has won me over. I'm attracted to music primarily by the lyrics, and the writing on Capsule is wonderfully intelligent -- from the political heat of ""Paul Revere"" to the wistful emotion of ""Ten Mile Yearning"" to the sea-shantyesque ""Anchor's Weight."" The music also cuts away into lighthearted, rollicking fun, as on ""TDW."" The band is more than able, with excellent guitar work, astonishingly beautiful female lead vocals on several tracks, a fine rhythm section, and a viola that ranges from mournful to foot-stompin'. Capsule seldom leaves my CD changer, where it is usually found in the good company of bands like the Indigo Girls.Exposure to The Rivergods has made me investigate other bands of the ""ND"" genre (like Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt), but I must admit that, in the end, I always return to Capsule. I couldn't recommend it more highly."
3,Low Fi,"I have seen the Rivergods live at T.T and the Bears in Boston and enjoyed the music so much that I bought the cd. Their music is raw and on the cusp of greatness. I do however, feel that Nancy's voice overwhelm's the harmony that she and Ben are trying to achieve in some of the songs. Her sluggish vibrato is a bit weighty! Anchors away!"
1,Don't waste your money,Unless you have an inside track to a company going public and are able to purchase shares at the opening price then don't waste your time. IPO's are only available for the larger institutional investors most of the time (at least as far as getting in on the lower opening prices that are sometimes available). So a book for the small individual investor for these is kind of pointless. It does have some useful information but not enough to justify the time your going to spend reading it. Just my opinion.
1,did not work,"The memory card does not work, i tried to email the store for help but they never responded"
4,"Not a MUST Read , but a GOOD Read","Yup, I realize people would say , oh yeezz npt another Walmart book. !!! But the catchy part of this books overall emphasis is the subtitle : `How to compete and thrive in a Walmart world'.It's a really easy read book, all of just around 225 pages and has neatly divided the book as follws : POCKETSIntroductionChapter 1 : Pricing strategies and TacticsChapter 2 : Operational Strategies and TacticsChapter 3 : Cultural Strategies and TacticsChapter 4 : Key Item/Product Strategies and TacticsChapter 5 : Expense Control Strategies and TacticsChapter 6 : Talent Strategies and TacticsChapter 7 : Service Strategies and TacticConclusionThough the book is an easy read, the author does tend to go round and round once in a while and could have really saved 50-75 odd pages. But manages to keep the reader alive by using his personal experiences and those of others with Walmart .http://www.bloglines.com/blog/PrashantP"
4,Explains clearly how lack of sleep affects lives,"This is a book that will make you think. The author provides example after example of how sleep deprivation, even in small amounts, diminishes the quality of our lives. Mr. Coren examines the effect of sleep loss on children, teenagers, adults, and the elderly through scientific and anecdotal material. After reading this book, I made a concerted effort to get more sleep for the sake of those around me and to improve my life, personal and public. This ""sleeper"" issue (I can't resist the pun) deserves serious attention. Hopefully, this book will alert readers to the fallacy in the modern day view of sleep as nothing more than a waste of time"
5,"What a tremendous, important book...","This book presents an amazing clear, well-reasoned, and compelling case for more sleep and for taking lack of sleep seriously. I particularly like knowing the ""low points"" (1am to 4am and 1pm to 4pm) that we are naturally sleepy; and the various symptoms of lack of sleep (besides sleepiness), the personality changes such as irritablity, lack of motivation, lack of sense of humor. And it's so readable that I stayed up too late reading it :-) I wish it wasn't written so long ago, I'd love to read the most recent research - but this is one of those books I want everyone to read. Lack of sleep isn't just a mild annoyance one lives with, it's a problem that should be treated, and it's easy enough to treat (go to bed!)"
3,Read once a few years ago. Not very memorable.,"I'm not saying that the book was poor, but it didn't have a lasting affect. Something along the lines of getting sleep is a good thing is the take-away. Anyone buying this book already knows it or they wouldn't buy it."
3,An Insomniac's Dream...,"Read this and the most incurable insomniac will go to sleep.It's not that the book is bad--there are beautiful, even luscious discriptions of Africa and its people, andthere are number of interesting, intriguing vignettes, especially in the first part of the second half of the book--but the whole is supposed to equal the sum of its parts. This book does not.Frankly, it fails in that respect. Just too long, too wordy, too overwritten at times. In part, perhaps, because of the writing style of the time in which it was written--the mid-30s--it is slow and boring at times. Some of it puts the mind to sleep and that part the insomniacs will love.All the same, it is a book worth reading. But take your time and have something else to read while you are working your way through it. It's a slow read, at times downright boring, but, in the end, when it matters most, it is a book worth reading."
5,Perfect,"Was looking for missing silverware I've had for 20 years, it was crazy expensive at Macy's (DOUBLE THIS PRICE FROM AMAZON), this was a good deal and matched perfect with my set."
3,buyer beware,"If you are a fan of Michel Legrand, especially his music of the mid to late sixties, then this is for you. However if you are a fan of Gene Kelly, Catherine Deneuve, George Chakiris or just about anyone else in this film and you want to hear them, forget it. The only person in the film who actually does his or her own singing is Danielle Darrieux."
4,"Excellent quality, cuff too large","The cuff arrived promtply and in excellent condition. The quality of this cuff is very good; however, the cuff is larger than expected--too large for average to small adult females."
3,ADC 720 Manual blood pressure monitor,In my ignorance I didn't realize that an stethoscope is required to use this monitor and if used correctly it would take 2 people to get an accurate reading.Red faced I have donated the unit to a local community college where it will be given to a beginning nursing student.Advise others to research a bit before buying.
2,Not comfortable - runs narrow,"I was looking for a comfortable walking shoe that I could take on vacations where I would be walking 8-10 hours per day. I would not be able to walk 2 hours in these shoes. They are not supportive and I would not consider them a comfortable walking shoe. In addition, I am a very consistent medium width and these shoes were very narrow."
2,Bottom of the Barrel,"Although the poses were OK - the same as what you would get on any other normal video - the sound was absolutely horrible. You can tell this is a low budget tape. No special attention was placed on the audio. All you hear is an annoying echo.When the instructor is giving direction, she's usually in the pose, so she's talking into the mat, which rendors the audio even worse. There are additional directions given, however, they are written on the screen. If you're in a pose, being able to view the screen in order to read isn't going to happen to easily. I've seen better ....MUCH better."
1,Last quarter of this book is blank!,"This is not the complete works. Order the Bigger copy for around $50. This must have been an early attempt to scan this book for re-publication. Whole sections are missing gaps of between 30-40 pages, at a time. One quater of the book is also been scanned in from a German version of this text. The last quarter of this reprint is blank. This version of the reprint should be pulled from the shelves. Do not buy! Do not buy!"
1,Disappointed,"Good looking Guitar, but was totally not setup. It was a gift to my friend and he had to spend an additional $100 to setup the whole guitar up. The neck had to be raised and a whole setup had to be done. Please dont ship Guitars without the very obvious setup. Its a Guitar, it better sound good when it comes out of the store and it definitely didn't ! Very disappointed you guys ."
3,"Black guitar has 4 good reason,s but mostly for style","The Black guitar looks wonderful. I kept the poster on my wall and marked it. But Thestrings sounded softly and it was out tuned (duh). I accidentally Broke a stringwhich i wounded up too much with the head and broke another trying to replace (even with reading the instructions).So since that didn't work I will have to go to the music store and get a new string (E-1). I will have to get my Dad to do it this time.The style is really good. It shows that it is very pricey and That I saved up allot. I had 2 other reasons, Let a friend come and play and play bye Myself with sweet sound but not without a missing string.UPS just laid it there at the door so you don't really have to sign up.Or maybe????"
4,Good Value,"For $150, I can't complain. It's a functional electric guitar that doesn't look horrible, and sounds alright too. It's not a top-of-the-line guitar by any means, and parts of the construction do feel a bit cheap ... but again, for $150, I can't complain."
3,Manufacturing quality concern,"So far this guitar has treated me well as a beginner. However, the screw holding the peg for the strap came out within 15 minutes of opening the box. They had tried to fix the hole that was drilled too large by adding a nail, but it did not work. Essentially, I felt like I was getting a used guitar."
2,Vietnam??,"I only ordered one place spoon to replace a lost one. It's been over a year since I received it, and to my surprise, when I used it yesterday to stir a lemon sauce, I found on the back of the bowl of the spoon the word Vietnam and a number 2-06. I think the viscosity of the sauce caused the lettering to be enlarged. I quickly pulled all the other spoons from the drawer, and checked them for the same lettering...none there. I looked at the markings on the handles, and they were all the same. What is the deal with this? I would prefer not having that written on my spoon."
4,Tom Middleton's Cosmos mix is great.,"This single has 2 slow songs and 1 dance remix. Next Men Radio edit has a slight hip hop flavor. Attica Blues remix has lots of piano and is easy on the ear. Tom Middleton's Cosmos mix is the star here. It flows so nicely into an ethereal and melodic fusion of new age and dance music. There are additional mixes of the song which unfortunately did not make it on the cd singles. (Future shock remix). It is similar to the cosmos mix, only with a heavier dance beat.Even though this could have been a more comprehensive cd, I still have to rate it high because of the Cosmos mix."
2,interesting but--,Certainly interesting although very short and he disappears intothe stars toward the end and totally loses his focus toward the end.
4,Troubling but pretty good,"We all probably know intrinsically that humanity is more at risk than at any earlier phase in its history. Natural risks such as colliding with an asteroid still exist; what is new is the power that science has given small numbers of people to endanger the entire species, perhaps the majority of the biosphere. Dr. Rees explains these new risks but at the same time is optimistic that they can ultimately help if only we make sure to be careful. My mother told me that. Read his other book first--JUST SIX NUMBERS--as it's much better. But this book is still recommended... - lc"
2,Cannot get this device to pair or connect,"The price was right, the idea was good. The instructions are worthless and I cannot find a support site. $10 down the drain. If you follow the instructions to pair it will not pair. If you try pairing another way it pairs but never connects. I am furiosly looking for a support site to get the correct instructions. This should be simple."
5,Gorgeous Family Bible,"This beautiful bible is jam-packed with art taken from Renaissance bookmaking (mainly the Urbino Bible), and it is printed on heavy, glossy paper with rich, high-quality ink. The translation is that of the King James Version.This bible exceeded my expectations and is probably one of the most beautiful family bibles on the market at a very reasonable price. Five stars."
2,I lost interest 3/4 way through!,"No offense, but I couldn't even finish this book! It's very repetetive and droll! God, the main character is a big self-pitying bore. It's not very often that I invest a week of reading and then don't care enough to finish the book. Sorry, Donald!"
5,Poignant Stories from Russian Culture,"These stories seem to be a part of a cultural life, clearly Russian, that one can take a hold of. My own sense of having a Russian heritage adds to my interest, but the stories themselves are immediately captivating, and the nature of fairy tales is that one's mind works, and delights in both developing problem and solution. I personally have become acquainted with a body of tales from several to numerous cultures; this invests us in some of the richness that surrounds us. These particular stories have a very plucky, vital quality, and sound good in the telling and spelling out. I would recommend this version, because of the fun it is to open up and read to oneself or aloud to others."
2,"Thank goodness for the ""search inside"" feature","I almost bought this as a shower gift for a friend returning from Russia with two newly adopted boys. Thank goodness for the search inside feature, though! The first story ends with the husband giving a ""good thrashing"" to his cheating wife's lover and to her as well. Not the thing I was looking for!"
4,Russian Fairy Tales,"I find the stories in here comparable to Grimms and Hans Christian Anderson. They are magical and a fantastic read and a source of discovery of tales from another culture. It is part of my fairy tale collection which I will savour to pass on to my grandchildren for their enjoyment.I love that its set in a more adult format; which I feel adds to the longevity of the collection remaining in the home as it can be enjoyed by young and old, no matter your age.Keep the child in you 'alive' I say. Remain in awe of the wonders of the world."
1,Doesn't last,It cracks almost immediately after putting it on and sitting. Maybe I expected too much.
2,Rips like paper.,"In combination with a generous amount of duct tape, this product is very useful. In short, the thing rips easily. That being said, the product was invaluable. I had to move a mattress down a set of very dirty stares (4 flights), and the cover kept the mattress intact. So - good product, needs to improve on the material though."
5,Just as stated,"This is a great cover. It is quiet like mentioned in the description and fit perfectly on the bed. I have had it for over a month now with my kids jumping on the bed constantly. No rips, tears, or wear marks...and also no leaks!!"
3,Just OK,"This serves it's purpose well I suppose. It definitely is NOT noise-less though like it states in the description. I used this to cover a futon that my dog primarily likes to lay on- she's a spoiled brat!! She jumped up on it before I could cover it with a sheet so she did puncture it with her claws, it's pretty thin plastic."
1,Ripped before opening package,"I ordered 3; one was ripped before I opened the package, another split open at the seams while putting it on the mattress and the third split at the seams within a few days. You get what you pay for."
2,Noisy,"I didn't expect the plastic coating to be so noisy. Hard to turn over on a bed, without waking up from the noise of the plastic."
1,Cheap!,"This item arrived quickly and that's where the good of this ended. The cover was a cheap plastic and it tore before it was completely on the mattress. It is a normal size mattress so I do not understand why it didn't fit. Since it was cheap, I didn't want to go through with buying a new one but you are better off going to the dollar store and getting one there for 2 bucks. This one seems like it came from a dollar store."
3,Dreaming of you,"Today I like remember a friend, a big musician that is not more between us, but his music stays in the time like if pits here, and then he has played bass on Fair Warning of ToddRundgren. I have told all.Lino Terlati"
2,Nice in theory,"This game was nice in theory, but I never really used it. I think it would difficult to use this game to accomplish any serious weight loss."
2,Buyer Beware (or at least forwarned)!,"I wanted to add a second monitor to my emachines desktop running Windows 7. This seemed like a good deal.However, this (with a blue, not black, casing) is an old version and is not compatable with the Aero function of Windows 7. I happen to like that function. for another verson of Windows, this would be just fine."
4,Spanish Student,I am a spanish student at a high school in New Jersey. We use the holt spanish book and right now i am in spanish 3. this book teaches the language in easy to understand directions and activities. it is a wonderful book for learning a wonderful language. VEN CONMIGO!!!!! come with me!!!!
3,Insightful and powerful but Chomsky has done better,"This is a very good lecture by Mr. Chomsky but he has done better on the same subject. If you are to buy only one of these lectures check out ""Free Market Fantasies: Capitalism in the Real World"" by Chomsky. It is clearer and more eye opening than this.This is a very good lecture and delivers nice points but ""Free Market Fantasies: Capitalism in the Real World"" brings up more issues and realities that the average Joe never gets through the media."
5,Who started it? Why was it started?,"If you are new to Noam Chomsky, then let me start with this: he has the unique distinction of being on the ultimate list, that is, of the top ten most quoted in the world while still being alive. Right up there with the Bible and Shakespeare. In this audio speech given in 1995 he outlines who started the class war, against who, and for how long it has being going on and shows us why they did it. If you don't mind being challenge to question why you believe what you do, then you will find this most enlightening and refreshing. And now more than ever you maybe motivated to get involve in changing the way things work for the sake of your children and their children and the worlds future."
2,Drivel,"This audio recording is a whining, self indulgent, paranoid and conspiracy theorist style indictment of big business. He hates the Fortune 500 companies, but it would be interesting too see what the USA would be like if these companies suddenly disappeared of the face of the earth. Would it be a good place to live in then? What would Mr. Chompsky say to that? Rather buy ""Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal"" by Rand, and Greenspan if you want to read something that makes sense."
4,MY FAVE LIVE STRANGLERS CD,"Actually 4 1/2 stars! This CD has exactly the best songs (early, on up through Feline).The keyboard sound is great (think Raven, La Folie sound), but the bass is solid enough that it also ROCKS. Great versions of European Female, Golden Brown, Strange Little Girl, etc. The sound quality is excellent, but just dirty enough to not sound studio-produced. This is Everything I want from a Stranglers live album - and no horns, which makes it better than later live albums, and a little better than X-Cert because it contains top early 80's tunes, along with the older stuff."
4,A good entry in the Recluse Saga,"I enjoyed this novel in the Recluse series because it gives further insight into the complex magical system that Modesitt has created. It is fun to see how Justen changes through the book, and to watch the relationships with his brother, and other characters evolve. The pacing was a bit slow, just as in other Modesitt novels, and at times I got tired of the myriad of details he provides. Overall, enjoyable, especially the second half."
1,I do regret buying and attempting to read this 4th book,"I had read the 1st book in the recluce saga and found it bearable so I thought modesitt could deserve another try and bought the other books. This 4th one, Order War is indeed a war but it is a war you hold against yourself on the grounds of money - the 2 months waiting time - wishes - the ultra boring repetitive scenes (fiction - cha.s) from the 1st book. I could not finish it. 1st book contained some ideas, some limited horizon in the faraway places you did not read but COULD guess. This one contains nothing NEW. I've made up my mind for good to not to read anything with Modesitt name on it. I do not understand the five stars. Do they come to point at the surprising resentment ?"
5,close to perfect,"I have been enthralled with Mr. Modesitt's book's since I recently discovered him while waiting for a plane. I think his Recluse novels bring out the best in the fantasy/ Scifi genre. Although his style is predictablehe still manages to keep the intent of his book to himselfuntil the final chapters. By predictable I mean that I had guessed that Justin was going to destroy Fairhaven.I had know idea he was to become a druid in the process. This is the essence of L.E.'s books. You think you know what is supposed to happen, and it usually does, for a while, but the left curves more than make up for the obvious know it all syndrome"
3,"Good, but....","The more I read Modesitt's work, the more I fight with the thought, ""Do I get the next?"" They have gone from great to good. The editorials and comments on the next couple of books don't look promising.I have to agree, that Modesitt's sometimes just gives too many details about his character's professions. There's only so much I want to read about blacksmithing, engineering, and carpentry. He spends a lot of time telling you what a blacksmith does and thinks about, but doesn't put it into user friendly terms.Lastly, there is only so much bread and cheese people can eat without MAJOR CONSTIPATION! Sounds like his characters would hae some serious ""order"" problems since every meal is BREAD and CHEESE. I think laxatives need to be introduced by a gray mage. It is, after all, a form of order which produces chaos ....Do I get the next???"
3,Dated but pretty good,"I liked the way the author did not dimiss miracles and covered what was probably meant by the ""Kingdom"" first.Despite plattitudes that Jesus was the most influential person to have ever lived (the problem being that what exists of his genuine output is rare, and his status as a saint was even at the time pretty ambiguous) - I think this is a portrait which combines facts and impressions with a definite direction and conclusion. The role of St Paul and many of the saints like Peter or lack thereof is revealed. We also get a digest of the search for the historical new testament.A bit dated, this is an easy read and makes most of what is known available to readers. I'm not sure whether it glorifies or insults Christ but I feel wiser about him in having read this work."
3,Good story,Nice story with quality characters. A little slow in spots but overall a good plot. Not sure I liked the perspective switch would have been nice to just see it from sage. Really enjoyed the Native American aspect but could have done without another lesbian sleeping with married women theme. Seems to be a common one lately.
5,Great read,A touching story about finding love when all hope has been lost. Keeps your attention the whole way through! Definitely recommend.
4,Legacy of Love,It was a touching and sweet story that I will enjoy reading again. I would definately recommend this book to everyone.
5,A story within a story,"This is my first Martin read. The story of Sage and Deanna is very interesting and not your normal formula for this genre. The book is about love, but it is also about the Seneca Women. I am unsure how this will move forward in sequel, but I hope Martin expands on this story. There are many battles that Sage must fight with the tools her grandmother left her. Tools passed down to each generation by Seneca Women. Deanna must let go of insecurities in order to be in a position to accept and give real love that is destined to come to her. By a connection neither women are aware of This they are brought together. Whether they stay there depends on them both. This is an amazing book and I recommend it to other readers."
2,"Good author, not some of his best work","I don't know, I thought this seemed like a great idea. And maybe in some markets it is. In Philadelphia, it's different from the authors home of Florida and I just didn't get anything out of reading this book. When he says options are a little known used RE tool, he ain't lying! After reading Mr. Lucier's book I realized that this was a concept that was completely impractical for me. Some of his stories about finding warehouses that sat vacant for years, cleaning the floor and a coat of pain and voila! $25000 profit, well, they just seem totally out there to me. If you think you can make a go of it, yes, it takes little money but this concept is seldom used and not going to work in many places."
3,"Informative, but many other options","As a beginner in investing I am at a point where I'm still learning the tricks of the trade. Though this book was infromative I still have to favor the others I have read specifically, ""The Pizza Delivery Millionaire""..by Rick Vazquez. It's sold here on Amazon and also on their website for an affordable price..which I think is a great deal if1. you are intimidated by investing2. You want to start investing but have no idea where to startThat book is great!"
5,A Great Primer and Bookshelf Reference for All,"when i first started reading this book, i got all excited because it looked like it was gonna be filled with lots of ""advanced"" technical information that i can read, review, and research for more detail. i was right. i enjoyed this book from start to finish (even though it got a little slow for me somewhere in the middle, i understand that the basics must be included to appeal to a broader audience).one thing that i am all jazzed about that was mentioned in the book, but wasn't talked about in detail, was regarding the taxation of the option consideration. the option consideration is not taxable until the exercise of the option. now, with just this bit, you can get pretty creative.also, i corresponded with the author and it was nice to know that he keeps his promise to answer any technical questions via email or phone. now that's awesome!"
5,Very Good Book - Highly Recommended!,"Length:: 2:02 MinsThomas Lucier is one of the first guys I learned about Lease Options from. He is a no-holds barred type of guy. DON""T MESS WITH LUCIER! He will tell it like it is. He has very good checklists in his books. This is a whole bootcamp in a book. I highly, highly recommend it! I use a lot of his principles in my own Wholesaling Lease Options business. - Joe McCall ([...])"
2,Simply a book of lists,"I've made it about halfway through this book and had to stop. It was so dull and dry, full of lists of things to do to find and buy Real Estate options. Good information, but dull as could be. It would have been much better had the author included examples of how to go about using the techniques he lists. But once again, the information was good if that's all you're looking for."
2,"The ideas sound great, but lack online support","I read most of this book and the ideas sound great, but after checking the author's web site I found the support limited. He offers his own personal support for a fee, but there is no way to contact anyone other than himself. Like every other how-to book on real estate you have to ask a question. Does anyone besides the author use this method? If so, how do I contact these individuals?Until I come across a book like this, I find it hard to believe the author's information."
3,So-so,"Cool-looking item. The only negative is that the sound is somewhat ""garbled"", so my daughter can't really understand what she's singing. I had to look up the lyrics on the Internet and print them out for her... Oh well... I've made better purchases."
4,Excellent,Top quality. Heavy feel in hand. Great detailing. Will recommend to friends. You can trust Oneida in all silver products.
3,Need the book,The book is very helpful for the at need children at our school I have the teacher's manual would like to get the book it self. If anyone can help me that would be great.
5,"If you've got a big enough oven, go for it!","This is a nice pizza pan because you can make an enormous pie. If I'm having lots of people over, I'll make a few pizzas and cut them into squares. It yields far more pieces and they tend to go further. Most ovens won't hold a 20"" pan, so be careful before you buy this one. Measure your oven. If it won't take a 20"" pan, downsize to 19"" or 18"" or whatever you can manage. It takes very little extra work to make a larger pizza, but it can serve quite a few more people, so it is certainly worth it."
4,Shears that work!,"Got these shears to complete a residing project of a 3200 sq. ft. home. So far the shear have worked great. They are sharp fast and compared to the old ones I was using, I really have to concentrate to stay on a straight cut. The price was what I expected but cheaper than any in store shears I cold find."
5,Great Tool!!!!,"Wary of tool's jaws from previous users, but found that the tool worked great. Used to reside a two story house with Hardi-Lap siding, so used for a million short cuts. Tool cuts to 1/16 tolerance, and tracks a cut in a straight line. Highly recommend to others.Only shortcoming - DeWalt provides a hex wrench to remove the housing screws in case something breaks - wrench is loose. Why? If they think the wrench is important enough to provide to us in original purchase, why don't they mold a small clip holding in the tool body or handle, or a recessed clip space - to keep track of the accessory? Another reason why I think these tool manufacturers are all quite stupid......."
1,hope I got a defect,"shear worked well on the first 10 cuts, then the shear blade broke inside the head. Looked for a replacement part - cast iron blade the size of a pocket knife - cost $100. since it broke in the first 30 days, I returned it to Amazon and got a full refund. I need a cement shear so will try the porter cable or another brand."
1,dewalt D28605,worked great when cutting on the back side of the hardie board. But 1/4 of the way through my siding job one of the bolts broke and the eccentric sleeve shattered. I have yet to find out how much the repairs will cost? sounds like this is a common problem.
5,Great Book,"This was a very good book, and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I read TONS of books. I bought this book not knowing about or ever hearing about Jane Holleman. It must have been fate! This book has loads of action, a great lead character, a story line that keeps you reading the book. Very fast paced, which I love in a book (I hate for things to drag along for half the book). Anyone who likes Patterson, Kellerman, Cornwell, Evanovich-you will love this book. A writing style that I fell in love with, and went out to get her other books."
4,Good Book!,Found this book at our local Dollar Store and was surprised that it was so good! The characters were interesting as was the plot.
1,Beyond bad...,"I read this book, unfortunately. Yes it is a story about good vs evil, but the characters are charicatures and none of them, even the so called good guy, has any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Even the good guy is a pretty rotten person. I'm sorry that I wasted my time reading this book - a few hours of my life that I can never get back again. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, ever."
1,just plain PLAIN,There was not a lot of imagination in this book. The plot jumps around so that it is difficult to follow the story line. It seems that the author's brain just never settles down. Maybe better luck next book.
3,Good for a 1st time novelist but a bit predictable.,"Not bad for a first time try. The book is pretty sterotypical & not very pro-women. Beautiful blonde living the perfect life gets caught up in murder, drugs, revenge. Sort of read like a screenplay. This book would be fine for a made for tv movie. It was entertaining & I don't begrudge spending the amazon price to read it"
3,Uneven Tales,"Like the literary conceit on which the book is based, My Lives is all over the place both in the quality of its writing and in the quality of its insights. For long streches I felt almost resentful at White's rambling discourses on the females, friends, and foes in his life--alleviated by occasional flashes of almost lyrical beauty (such as his description of the Ile St. Louis in winter) and sociological insight. Much of the time I felt robbed at having paid for the book rather than being paid for what seemed like asynchronous therapy sessions like which my dispersed hours with the book seemed to feel.I am still not quite sure how much of his narrative is whining and how much bemused narrative about his foibles as one who grew up in the pre-Stonewall era. No one seems to come off well, except perhaps his long-suffering current lover, about whom White maintains a virtual silence; and perhaps this is just as well."
5,Loved It,"I bought this because I have been a fan of Jane Seymour's for years. I was curious to see what I would think of her after reading her autobiography. This was more than a usual autobiography. You not only find out things about Jane's life, but intertwined are stories about people she knows going thru their own stuff. I thought the stories were touching, sometimes surprising, and flowed well with the topic of the given chapter. This is one of those books that I hated to put down. I thought it would be interesting but I was very surprised that it was also uplifting. I felt better after I read it. If that doesn't make a book great, I don't know what does."
2,Failed Marriages and a Life of Privilege to teach others,I was sorely disappointed. The title and book jacket verbage make this sound like an outstanding read but I found it a tale of failed marriages and I felt sorry for Seymour and her choices but I hardly find it a model to teach from. Somehow I missed the lessons of the reviewers but then she is from the Hollywood crowd and they sing each others praises. A nice lady I'm sure but I found it more about her than about the lessons.
2,"Some funny situations, but gross!","I can see how some teenagers would make this a popular movie, for it deals with areas that suggest sex and stimulate their desires to experience freedom in the discussion of ""bathroom and body-parts humor."""
4,Cameron Diaz's Best Performance,"This being the third of the farrelly brothers movies, they started to get the hang for what they were doing, and thus the output was positive. Brilliant performances from both diaz and stiller, and a very funny performance from matt dillon. If you like toilet humour, this is the one for you."
4,Hilarious! Another comedy classic,"Mary is a very very funny and entertaining film. The Farelly Brothers are hilarious. The film tells the story of Mary(Diaz) who is the most popular girl in high school. Ted(Ben Stiller) falls for her and after defending her retard brother goes to the prom with Mary. But before the prom Ted has a little accident and they dont go and he never hears from Mary again. Now fast foward 13 years to 1998. Ted is still living in Rhode Island and Mary has moved away to Florida. Ted's friend Dom(Chris Elliot) tells him to hire a private eye to find her. Thats all ill tell cause i dont want to ruin it for anyone. But just see this. Its so very funny and good. But if you are offended by crude humor or silly stuff, you may not like it. Rated R for language and silly, crude, sexual humor."
4,Weak tips despite heft of the tool,"You will be getting exactly what is pictured, which is three of the same tweezer. It would've been nice if there was some variation - for example different tip ends.The tool is hefty and the locking mechanism slides easy to lock the tips. The tips are narrow, which I think it's desired, but they are quite solid. One nice feature, not pictured, is the plastic tip protector they ship with.The quality of the finish is so and so - it will probably show signs of corrosion not long from now, and there were some rough edges that can be easily filed away.For the money, I think it's a good purchase, and although not a staple in my toolbox, they get used quite often."
4,Great for AP Human Geography,Currently I am taking an AP Human Geography class in my high school and this is the book we were assigned to buy. This book has wonderful charts and pictures along with descriptions. This book goes into depth and doesn't only touch the surface. I recomend this book to AP Human Geography teachers and students!
2,An Introduction to Human Geography,"This book was not very well written or edited; in fact, there were several major typos or misspelled words. In one place, the text is discussing three different topics and says ""First.... secondly... and secondly"" instead of saying ""lastly"" or ""thirdly."""
2,Cute but not my favorites,"These letters are just okay, not great. They used to sell them at another retailer also, and I have never been crazy about them. The same company sells a set of these with the words ""Sweet Dreams"", and those whole kits sell for $20, so these cannot possibly be worth $8 each. We searched lots of places for letters and bought ours from another web site. They had cuter gingham letters in several colors as well as toile and striped letters and cute white whimsical letters for just $8.50 each. So we wouldn't recommend these."
3,Not her best work,I did not get much out of this book. I will read it again to see if I missed something in the first round
5,This book is wonderful!,"I recently downloaded this book on my Kindle, and I couldn't put it down. This book is a godsend for anyone who has problems with food cravings, whether they are short-term cravings that change form time to time or long term addictions to something like chocolate or wine. The book gives a quiz to help the readers determine the type of overeating they do and also provides long term and short term recommendations for dealing with cravings. I found this book when I was dealing with a craving for pistachios and cashews, and I was bowled over when I found that the book not only covered my problem and explained exactly why it was happening, it also gave me the tools to deal with the problem. This book rocks!"
2,"Okay, not anything new said","The book was not an amazing read and anyone who has worked within healthcare or battled emotional eating will not get anything from this book. Basically, we crave foods based on our emotions and the real advice is to get in touch with your emotions and that's that. Many other great books out there that say more and offer more."
5,Stupendous,"This is baroque opera at its finest, featuring two of the most glorious voices ever: Joan Sutherland and Fritz Wunderlich, both at the peak of their extraordinary careers. The tempo drags a bit throughout (as was then the fashion for Handel), otherwise there is little to criticize---and a great deal to praise. For those of us who are Handel freaks, this is indispensable. But all lovers of fine vocal music will want this rare 1959 recording. Gorgeous, moving, and beautiful."
1,Dismayed,"This book was so highly recommended I thought it would be chock full of information I never thought of regarding a pending retirement. It was just awful. Talk about ""no duh"" type of advice - write a will....no kidding?!?!?? :(I'll never buy another book from this woman."
1,I did not like it. There are better books,"Try these books: Retirement Bible, J.K. Lasser's Your Winning Retirement Plan, or Ernst & Young's Retirement Planning Guide (Ernst and Young's Retirement Planning Guide)."
1,Don't lose your money buying this book,Barely 170 pages - a waste of $22 for me to have bought the hardcover of this book. The book is poorly organized and gives lengthy coverage to topics not deserving (such as long-term care insurance) and is terribly superficial on vital issues such as understanding investments. I've read many financial guides far superior - the best being Personal Finance for Dummies which is jam packed with 400 pages of insights and concrete ideas.
3,This informational book helped me with my finances.,I thought that this book was very educational and I suggest you should read it. The section on wills and trust was especially informative.I suggest that anyone looking for a good future in finance and retirement should purchase this wonderful book and look into other masterpieces by Suze Orman.
2,Too dated,"Too dated to be useful in CT, but it did spur me to visit my attorney to get briefed on changes in estate planning."
5,Suze Orman,Good book to have in your library. Great seller and quick delivery of book. Thanks A=======
3,Some good info.,I love Suze and often watch her show. The book was good but mostly focuses on people with little retirement income and assets. Finally when I found something I really was interested in it had no details at all.
4,One minor thing,"Great box. Just one minor thing there are no English subtitles. I am from The Netherlands and not a English native speaker so I really like it when a dvd has subtitles. I didn't know before purchasing so keep this in mind when you order!Other then that it's a great box, great quality and already had lot's of fun with friends watching it. WHAT? OKAY!"
5,Too funny,"Dave Chapelle is too funny in all of the skits he does. We still watch it and laugh out loud, it's not for the feint of heart, as he covers so many ""taboo"" topics I wouldn't let the kids see it, but if you can just take it for what it is and the comic nature, you'll love this dvd set"
5,Dave is the man!,"I picked this dvd up and I cannot wait to get it. I have seen episodes on tv but haven't watched every single one. Dave is the best comedian out there. This show is so different then all the other shows that ""try"" to be funny. Dave Chappelle is unique and of course his show is going to be different and better then all the rest. Don't hesitate to pick this dvd up; you will not be disappointed! Dave Chappelle rocks!"
5,Well worth the money!!,"I brought this item for my husband and he or should I say we, love it! I brought it in March and have watched it at least 6 times since then! Perfect gift for anyone! Dave C. is hysterical and you are sure to be left in tears from laughing so hard! I def. recommend this item."
2,The first one was deffinently better! From SF,"When I read the first one I was very intrigued. The first one was filled with adventure and action fitting in some humor. I could never put it down. The second was a disapointment. I found myself wishing for the chapter to be over. The humor was sarcastic and the characters have lost there flavor. Of course,it just is a quincedence that the dragon survive a venemous bite and then dies from a shot from a pistol. The only good thing about it was the action with the scene with the guns."
4,Good Way To Spend An Afternoon,"This is the second book in the Pit Dragon trilogy set in a future world beyond Earth. In this novel the main character, master and ex-bonder Jakkin, leaves his dragon and her hatchlings to help his love interest Akki.Generally a good way to spend an afternoon. I would recommend to anyone interested in this genre because the characters and the world the author created are well written, but it is mainly a young adult novel and that needs to be kept in mind when reading."
3,OK,"I though that the first book of the trilogy was pretty good, but this one did not live up to it's predecessor at all. It was all politics and kind of boring. It was OK if you like the subject but I was really expecting something completely different after the first one. You should read it if you liked the first one, and want to read the third. However if you're the kind of person who doesn't mind reading books out of order then you might as well just skip it."
2,s2 Camera Batteries,"This may be a bargin for the batteries, I'm not certain yet but they seem to hold up. It is the charger that I didn't think was that great. It wouldn't charge the batteries right out of the box. I had to use a better Energizer charger to initially charge the batteries. Once the batteries had a charge it seems to work OK, but if I were to buy again I probably would go for the Sony Charger."
1,Battery Charger,This product was returned. It was shipped with only 4 batteries instead of 8 batteries. and wouldn't charge. very poor quality.
4,pretty good,"First I didn't get the right batteries, but then they sent me 4 others, the correct ones this time!So all good and on time!"
3,Does anybody bought those batteries?,raluca CHARGER + 8AA 2700MAH BATTERIES FOR CANON Powershot Digital Camera A630 A640 A710 IS A410 A430 A520 A530 A540 A610 A620 A700 S2 S1 S3 IS A400 A510 A85 A95 A75 A310 A80 350 A10 A100 A20 A200 A30 A300 A40 A60 A70 w/ international adapter plugs for use in 160 countries and any vehicle Includes 4 FREE Highest Capacity 2700 mAh AA Rechargeable Bateries & A FREE
3,cupcake baking cups,"these are really cute and good quality, but after I ordered, I saw them in a retail store for a fraction of the price. would not order these on line again, but they are adorable."
5,These are adorable!,"These cupcake wrappers are really adorable and will be nice for any occasion. The colors are vibrant and I will probably order more. The price seems about right, no big bargain but not overpriced either. Thanks for reading my review. Sometimes it is hard to come up with 20 words to write about a cupcake wrapper..."
3,Does the job,"I really liked this wrapper. However, I only gave it three stars as once you bake it the colors and designs aren't as predominate. When you're using a dark colored cake mix it doesn't show up that well at all when the wrapper is still on the cupcake. However, it does the basic job of a cupcake wrapper rather well. =)"
5,Man in the Trap,"A must read for every mental health expert. This book is a concise, clear and objective presentation of the work of W. Reich. Dr. Baker has given an invaluable contribution in presenting, organizing and clarifying a field of knowledge that is neglected by classical medicine. He also has given an unprecedented gift to mankind in its struggle for happiness. In my opinion this is one of the few works that can help psychiatry to extricate itself from the biochemical quagmire in which is drawning."
2,Go to the source - Read Reich's own writings,"Although this book does summarize many of Reich's teachings on his theory on pathology and treatment using Orgone Therapy, it also distorts much of Reich's philosophy for Baker's own agenda. So much so that I would not recommend this book for new readers interested in Reich's ideas and therapeutic approach. To truly understand Reich, it is essential that one reads Reich's own writings. Once one has a grasp on Reich's overarching theory and its clinical applications, than one is in a better position to critically read Baker's book and take it for what it is."
2,Scandinavian Delights??? SORT OF!!!,"This is my 2009 re-review of this book. The overall look of the ""house"" exteriors and built in interiors in the Scandinavian style look GOOD! However the owners interior furnishing/decor style is TERRIBLE! For people who spent a lot of time & $$$$ on this project its sad that they have NO sense of using antique Scandinavian furniture/art to decor this house? Owner has a repro Irish Claddagh door knocker, PLEASE! There usage of over sized mall furniture store pieces is SAD! For those reviewers stating that the overall project is an inspiration of Scandinavian style don't get IT!"
2,Too vague and rambling,"I read this after Lee Jones' excellent ""Winning Low-Limit Hold'em"". Krieger's book was not nearly as useful. And although it's a short book, it's not concise.I'm not sure what the target audience is for this book:- It's not for beginners, because it skips a lot of basic stuff.- Not for intermediates, because it doesn't offer anything beyond Jones' book.While the writing style is decent and the organization is promising, the content is rambling with a bunch of dead-end special cases.And the publisher really needs to hire an editor. I've never read a book with so many typos.If you haven't read Jones yet, that's the one to get for starting out in hold'em. You could probably do worse with this book, but Jones is a lot better (and shorter to boot)."
1,More Info,It would be very helpful to have a picture of the seafood fork instead of the place setting. All the other items seem to be in order.
4,great campy movie,"Evil Roy Slade was a movie I had heard about for years, and I got this for such a good price at Amazon and was able to watch it for myself. Funny, funny stuff. Kind of a early Blazing Saddles meets Napoleon Dynamite. Loved it."
3,Fun,Loads of fun if you are in your 50s or 60s. The younger viewers will probably think it is corny.
3,Great John Astin comedy,"Evil Roy Slade is a fun filled comedy-western with zany, sometimes cheesy over acting. John Astin is great in this old film with no blood which makes it suitable for family viewing. The film is very funny and Astin is great as ever. You can see his many Gomez Adams facial expressions which makes it a classic. This movie goes great with The Adventures of Brisco County Jr."
3,This was a gift.,I did not particularly care for this movie but my sister had been looking for it for a long time so I bought it for her as a gift.
3,o.k.,ITs an o.k. movie.Screw ball comedy of the old west.Stupitly kind of funny.A few old actors in it.Dont pay more than &10 for it....
3,Typical 60s Comedy,"When I saw this as a kid, I thought this movie was great. Watching it as an adult, I am reminded of how many of the people out in Hollywood were more concerned with drugs than storyline. This is a cute movie to watch, but it reminds me a lot of the skits I saw watching The Monkees TV show. Oscar material? Definitely not. Fun to watch with the kids on a lazy Saturday afternoon? You bet."
4,funny,"Evil Roy Slade is a very hard movie to find. I like Mickey Rooney, and John Astin both in the same movie make a very interesting comedy."
5,Have been waiting for this one!,This is my all-time favorite silly movie. Great lines abound. Anyone who watches this without belly laughs needs to see a shrink.
4,just plain silly and fun,"if you like the classic cowboy movie genre - then you should get a good laugh out of this one. It makes fun of just about every aspect of the clasic western - with a commendable cast of stars to fill the ticket, not to mention John Astin. A great movie to sit down for an evening and relax and laugh - good, lighthearted fun . . ."
5,Old School Humor!,This is a great example of humor by the masters. Great characters and lots of great jokes. You may need to see more than once to catch some of the subtle humor. It's too bad they edited out a few jokes from the original.A great addition to a collection of humor.
1,Evil Roy Slade,I didn't find this movie funny at all. I couldn't see why it was called a parody of all Westerns. The pacing was slow and the jokes were phooey!
2,Disappointing,I really like John Astin. This movie fails in the writing and not the acting (provided you like Mr. Astin.)
2,Evil Roy Slade,30 years ago I thought this was the most funny western I had ever seen. What happened? Don't waste your money.
2,Stupid and very dated.,I remember thinking this thing was funny when it was released but after searching the planet for a copy of the video I was very disappointed that none of the laughs I remembered survived the passing of 30 years time. What a bummer! Some memories are best left untampered.
5,Jeez I have finally got a copy,"This film cannot be bought for love nor money over here in the U.K. So finally after something like 25 - 30 years of searching I have finally got a copy coming from the States(thankfully my VCR is NTSC compatable).I only have ever seen this film once when I was about 10 or 11 back in 72/73....to say it has stayed in my memory ever since says a lot about it!!! I thought it was the funniest film I had EVER seen (and still do), and though I never ever saw it again I was always scouring the TV listings .... the closest I got to seeing it for a second time was whilst holidaying in Canada..I saw it listed but we could'nt get the T.V. station!!!I have to agree with the other reviews at Amazon (I have read every one!!) and say this has to be the best comedy film ever made, and although I was only small when first watching it the film has stuck with me throughout my life. At last my friends who thought I was nuts will get to see it!!!Can't wait!!!!"
3,Dad joke western,Great escape into dad joke world. Some of the corniest one liners in a movie .I highly recomend it to keep old people and the very young laughing.
3,A Solid Effort,"A very good effort from Lou Ann Barton. I had never heard of her before a friend in college at the University of Boston turned me on to her. This CD moves from slower blues to rhythm and blues with a very strong common demoninator, which is Lou Ann's voice. Very strong and hypnotizing. Her voice pulls you in and wraps you in a cacoon.A very good introduction to Lou Ann Barton. I can't wait to get more and see what else she is up to."
2,its okay i spose,okay movie....not much to it really....but its okay if u actually have some sort of idea as to what is going on....good for a science class (which is where i watched it)...its okay...i wouldnt reccomend it just for some movie to watch though....blah and i know some1 in the movie so ya that gives it the 2nd star!
4,Is this a Children's film?,"This beautiful little film is a miracle of photography and imagination. I bought it for grandchildren and I hope they will enjoy it in years to come. Criterian and Janus films seem to be promoting Paddle, The Red Baloon, and White Mane as children's films but I wonder how many will find the time in between the Shreks, Ants, Cars, and Incredibles, etc. Nevertheless I congratulate Criterian for making these little gems available and recommend them highly."
1,Negative 5 Stars for Tarantino,"QT laughs all the way to the bank. He fools people into believing his movies are good. He is sort of a George Romero with big budget films. He makes rubbish movies and people continue to flock to his crude, poorly made films to satisfy their blood lust.Why the 5 star reviews for this movie? Let's face it ............ some people have to have bad taste in order to keep the world balanced. GB is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Totally a waste of time to watch it. Do yourself a favor if you must watch it....... rent a DVD and when you realize how boring & bad it is you can fast forward through it."
1,Total disaster,"One of my favorite movies is ""Pulp Fiction"". After that Tarantino satrted, in my opinion, to rot. And mow this... ""Inglorious..."" is one of the worst movies I saw in years. More than that... In the country where people do not read books and do not know their history you cannot do this. It is bad as it is when Americans never admitted that Soviets broke Nazis, but now it is a matter of a bad joke. ""Basterds"" won the war and Jesus is black by the way.God save America."
1,Worthless rubbish,"Love (previous) Tarrantino...Love WW 2 movies (seen them all...twice)....Walked out of movie after half way through.Offended by the the stupidity and besides, it was boring. Do NOT waste your $$$, your time, or most importantly, your brain cells."
2,Point?,"I've always enjoyed Tarantino's films, but someone needs to put a leash on this guy. I don't mind watching an unconventional war film that presents itself as alternative history, but, in the end, what did this film really amount to? The dialogue was interminable, the scenes were interminable and the film's self-aware, I'm-so-clever-and-quirky-and-outside-the-box tone just aggravated me. Plus, I'll say it, I thought the film was boooooorrrrring. Do your worst, if you care to comment."
1,Snooze fest,"I bought this movie cause I heard so many great things about it. But I couldn't watch more than half of it. I don't mind the subtitles. I've lived in enough foreign countries to be used to that. But good lord, how do you make a movie about killing Nazi's so boering? Quentin Tarantino found a way. It drags from one scene to another with so much talking. The acting was great. The scenes were done beautifuly. But a movie that bills itself as an action movie had me asleep half way through it. And Brad pitt, who normally I like has a terribly unbeleivable southern accent, which kinda put his acting skills in question for me."
2,Lost between fact and fantasy,"Personally didn't care for the mixing of fact and fantasy.Seem more like an excuse for acting out some repressedneed for violence than a story line. Would not recommend.The acting was good, the story was not."
1,Hard to review the disc as it won't play for me,"Unfortunately, the disc gets stuck in an infinite cycle of showing the menu and then showing the short intra-menu video before returning to the menu, without ever allowing me to play the movie. I tried sneaking by this issue by going through the ""Select Scene"" menu, to no avail. I didn't watch this movie right away, so I had missed my return window. Very frustrating. The first BluRay I've had absolutely fail on me (out of 50 or so that I own and about the same amount that I have rented). I keep my firmware current on my two year old Panasonic. Maybe there will be an upgrade to fix this problem at some point, but for the moment, it is a $20 coaster."
3,Not bad,"I would have liked to finish viewing it ... but I did not resume viewing in the 48 hour window allowed. However, the movie did look interesting for the 10-15 minutes I did see."
4,Oscar winner blockbuster,"This film has all the ingredients of a good entertaining film: drama, thriller, war. In Nazi occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.Most recommended"
4,Good Movie,"Good Movie and the special features are pretty good. Not your typical Tarantino film, but a good one non the less."
4,If you like Quintin you will like this,Big on dialog like his other movies but most of us who like his movies enjoy the dialog. Personally I thought Brad Pitt might have turned in the weakest performance but the other actors were fantastic.
5,Glorious Movie,"I bought two of these, one for myself and one for my brother in law overseas... He and I both love the movie."
3,and....,"I Enjoyed Blu Ray of this movie. Usual Tarantino use of quirky narrative juxtapositions, excellent performances from actors (Gestapo officer here is excellent.) anachronistic music, dialog and cultural assumptions and over the top violence. The problem is the protagonists are directly involved with historical figures and what happens to them in the film did not happen. There is a reel missing at the end of the movie in my view. As my own inferior suggestion by way solely of example, If one of the basterds had not been killed in the cellar bar then one could cut from the end of the movie to him being revived by Landa or the Basterds, the realization all was still to play for but then we would have to imagine why and how it did not happen."
5,Tarintino's best yet,"This movie was amazingly hilarious, gruesome and beautiful. The cinematography is beautiful and the story line is a good mixture of humorous and serious. The movie can be graphic and extremely violent at times, so be aware before watching. The special edition is nothing particularly great but at the price you can get it these days, its not really more expensive than a non-special edition version. It does come with a DVD and digital copy which is really nice (and how all BluRay movies should be packaged).The high definition quality is great, and it looks and sounds stunning on HDTVs and surround sound systems. I recommend getting this if you like this movie and HD movies."
3,"Not Tarantino's best, but good fun...","As far as the story goes, this movie was just ""okay."" I am a Quentin Tarantino fan and generally really like to watch his movies. When you watch this movie, you definitely can tell it is a Tarantino film. I really enjoyed the way the film was shot and the overall look of the film. I also enjoyed the ""twist"" on history as we know this story wasn't even close to what happened to the Third Reich.Where this film lacked for me was in character development. Other than with Shoshanna, there was very little character development. I almost wish Tarantino had focused more on ""The Basterds"" than the story of Shoshanna. I didn't ever feel a connection with most of the characters and as such, didn't feel bad for anyone who died.As far as the actual Blu-Ray copy is concerned, there are some nice features. You just have to be ready to wait 5-10 minutes for the disc to load. Other than that, this is a great 2-disc set."
3,Nutso,"If you like the Brendan Tarantino genre, this will be great for you. Not a whit of historical accuracy here. Cristoph Walz was fantastic!"
3,Inglourious.3-4 Stars.,"I give QT's Latest ""Masterpiece"" if you can call it that, 3-4 stars. the movie of course is fiction,the end is good. but the movie to get there is all over the place. songs don't match the era even if it is FICTION! too long,no main character like in Quentin's Other movies. I am not by any means a QT fan. but I thought there wasn't that much gore, The Movie is A fun ""What If"" Scenario.It's worth renting to see for yourself. Although Valkyrie is a better movie. Would be nice to see the treatment in this movie given to Communists..With Stalin and all the Politburo in the same situation. Highly Doubtful,Hollywood would ever make such a film."
4,A must have for any Tarantino fan!,"As far as combo packs go, this one really appealed to me because it was so reasonably priced. That said, earlier reviews of the combo pack stated that there were issues with the digital copy. However, I am happy to report that it appears that this issue has been resolved and I had no problem redeeming my code. This is a must have for any Tarantino fan!"
2,Over-rated,"This movie was ok, there was some fine acting, but Quentin is one sick basterd.Talk about over doing the gore side of things, it was just unnessessary and really took away from sum.Would not buy this for my collection, and would not reccommend it either"
2,The only atrocity committed was this film.,"Long, boring, pointless. For a film about this crazy commando unit that goes Nazi hunting, there sure was very little of that going on. Just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. About nothing, and mostly from characters who weren't even ""The Basterds"". I think Brad Pitt and his merry band have a total of 30 minutes screen time in what is an insufferably long film. I should have guessed from the very first scene at the French farmhouse that this was going to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.If you must, out of curiosity or masochism or whatever, see this film for yourself, I highly suggest renting it first.I'm so over Tarantino. He's like the magazine collage maker of film. Just a bunch of stuff done by someone else pasted all over the place."
3,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah......","Although still a great director, Quentin Tarantino the writer, in his last 3 films (Kill Bill Vol. 2, Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds) has become a long-winded, self-indulgent bore. Basterds is easily the best of those 3, but it's still bloated with never-ending pointless scenes that should have been heavily edited or deleted. He's also run out of ideas for satisfying or shocking payoffs to those scenes. If he made Pulp Fiction today, it would need to be a trilogy because Jackson and Travolta would be discussing the Royale with Cheese for 45 minutes. He can still make excellent movies if someone can convince him to hire a screenplay editor."
3,Quality of download was poor!,The movie was great. The presentation was awful! The movie froze twice for no reason. Netflix works much better. I expect more from amazon prime.
2,"Slow death, I long for the time I will never get back wasted watching this","The subtitles were a bit quick for my taste, the dialogue was long, and the music...garbage. I'm glad I rented this and didn't buy it."
2,Another Bloody Sandbox Fantasy (this time with swastikas),"The actors are dolls. The director is a little boy. He makes them say clever and confusing things. Then he makes them kill and torture each other. He plays kitschy music in the background.This is every Quentin Tarantino movie ever made. And they've gotten less and less imaginative as the years have progressed.In Basterds he just puts swastikas on the sandbox. Take away the violence and sadism and all you have is a bunch of long-winded machine-like speeches which hold your attention only as a precursor to the violence Tarantino has conditioned you to expect, something like an 80's porno flick without the sex.If you enjoy the victim/victimizer paradigm, or have a deep-seated psychological need to watch simulated torture, this will be enjoyable for you.If you want to see a half-decent Tarantino flick, rent Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs."
2,Stupid Movie Waste of Time,"Many years ago I watched a movie directed by Quentin Tarantino, I promised myself then I would never voluntarily watch another movie he directed, last night I broke that promise to myself. The cast did a great job especially the one known as the ""Jew Hunter"". The costumes where excellent. But at the end of the movie I asked what was the point of this stupid movie? I thought it was going to be a new untold story of WWII, but it was just a venue for Tarantino to display the violence that has been the main theme in both of his movies I have seen. It was a waste of my time. And I promise myself I will never voluntarily watch another one of his movies. This time I really mean it."
5,Great War Movie,"This was a great war movie with typical tarantino humor. The video quality on the blu-ray was also great. A lot of unexpected plot twists. I will have to put this on my annual watch list of war movies along with ""The Dirty Dozen."""
5,Love this movie,Arrived quickly. No complaints about this. I'll pop it in and watch it about once every 6 months. Never tire of the movie. But then I often love movies that others dislike. Oh well.
4,Good Tarantino Film but a few scenes went on longer then should have,"Inglourious Basterds was a good Tarantino film with good acting by the actors within the movie. I still give it a 4 star rating because I took one star off because a few of the scenes I felt went on longer then they should have. One main scene would have to be the bar scene when some of the characters were meeting up with the actress to discuss the distruction of the Germans. It ended up being one of his better films but I have to agree with other people about the movie being so long about 2 hours and 30 minutes total. Though it being so long doesn't take away the fact I enjoy mutiple points in the movie, the accent of Brad Pitt in the movie, Mike Myers scene as a German officer and a few other scenes and one liners. But if your a Tarantino fan and don't mind long movies then pick this movie up and see how much of it you end up enjoying and add it to your collection."
1,Hogans Heroes a la Tarantino,"Boring, badly written, badly acted, historically and artistically false; this movie isn't even good enough to be a comic book. Brad Pitt is laughable, although he is looking surprisingly haggard. The only interesting part was trying to figure out why it's so hyped. I guess some people can't stop beating up on their dead enemies."
1,Charged twice for this movie,"We wanted to,watch this movie in HD. However, every five minutes the movie would stop and a "" Quality HD"" screen would appear. After this happened six or seven times, we went back to try the non-HD version. The movie did not download at all, we received an error message. When we tried,to,go back to,the Library, the movie was not listed. We ended up being charged for both the regular and the HD versions, neither of which were downloaded. This never happened when we had Netflix, I guess we will go back to using that service and not use Amazon."
3,"Brad, You Don't Look Jewish!","Started off good but then got tedious.Changing historical facts doesn't sit well with me.With that said, this had potential but misses the mark.If you are like me and love to see Nazis degraded, watch""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" which is admittingly fictionbut still gets the Nazis to get ""theirs"". And a lot of fun!"
2,Subtitle disaster,"Thank God I know where the freeze button is on my dvd control or I would have missed half the movie dialog. What the H was wrong with Tarantino on this one?I loved the plot, and wished it would have happened that way; millions of people would have been spared Germany's super race garbage.I could only do half of the bar scene at a time as the subtitles were making me sick trying to read light letters against a light background!!!There are those that will give this movie a big 5 star no matter what because of Tarantino, but I have to put this one way back on the watch again shelf, in back of Kill Bill, Etc."
2,"""basterds"" flick","Hate the ""Closed Caption"" thingy...primarily 'cuz they don't give enough time to read the dang words which are too hard to read also. Bummer! Although Chris Waltz was excellent."
4,Seriously Harmed by the Presentation,"Some kind of great film, which I got from Netflix. I would purchase my own copy but for one major problem: much of the movie is subtitled (Germans speak German, the French French), and the DVD uses the subtitles as they appeared in the theatrical version rather than dropping and enlarging them as is usually done on foreign language films released on DVD. The subtitles on ""Inglourious Basterds"" are too often difficult (sometimes impossible) to read even on a decent-sized TV screen, and some of the jokes and plot points are lost. I regret not seeing this movie in the theater,and I will hold off on any further viewing or purchase until such time as an improved disc with legible subtitles is issued. This DVD release was a major disservice to a major film."
2,Terrible -- Only one word to describe it!,A big fat waste of time -- Brad Pitt's acting laughable. I'm glad I rented it when it was 1.99 -- I would have been mad if I paid any more!
2,surprised,"I was a bit surprised, I expected more, based upon the trailors. I wanted to see it in the movies, but missed it and bought the movie expecting a great time.........I was dissapointed."
3,Just OK,Not great. The previews for this movie were all I'd recommend watching. I just didn't really like the story line.
3,eh,"I'm a fan of Tarantino, but this film put me to sleep. It's 75% talking and 85% of that is subtitles!!! A slow Tarantino film (known for his long scenes of dialogue) that you have to read... it was rough. It has it's moments, but they were too few, and Brad Pitt was more of an extraneous character (which might have been intentional since his accent was a bit silly. Not a bad movie, I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,"Good, Less Than Glorious","Major newspaper reviews ranged from 2 1/2 to 5 stars, and that pretty much captures my own feeling about this film. I felt there was a pretty good, serious movie about occupied France, especially well done in the opening ""chapter"" that introduces us to Landa (Christoph Walsh). A great deal of the movie, however, was intentionally over the top and, of course, it vears off into an alternative history universe that, in my opinion, seemed tagged onto the story in a rather slapdash way. There are two styles woven together throughout: extravagant gore as in the Basterds scalpings of German dead, and cat and mouse conversations usually but not exclusively conducted by Landa. Whether the juxtoposition of these styles works is, I suppose, a matter of individual taste. It didn't for me. There can be no doubt that Tarentino had fun with this film, but one hopes that he will eventually outgrow his fascination with the minor film genres of the past."
5,"Tarantino is one talented, er, basterd!","Given his bizarre, genre-twisting reputation, Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Bastereds"" impresses most with its decidedly old-fashioned suspense scenes!Everyone knows about Christoph Waltz, but to me the real standout performance here is Melanie Laurent as the cinema proprietor, a real study in subtlety and total immersion in a role. And of course Brad Pitt is a reliable crowd-pleaser as Aldo Raine (Fave moment: When Pitt, already in close-up, leans forward and says ""Ah WILL have mah SCALPS!"" Terrific)This is as good as everyone says, and makes for a magnificently entertaining movie night. One you'll long remember."
3,The Acting is Amazing...The Story is BS,This is an actors movie...it's character driven which I love....but Tarintino doesn't fudge history a little bit...He punches it in the face...but because he features Jews as almost superhero like as the good guys there wasn't a larger outcry that someone completely rewrote history...The truth and the sadness of WWII is lost in this film...the violence isn't what is highlighted though...It's the tension..make no mistake Tarintino is a master filmmaker and his ear for dialouge is unmatched by anyone out there...Yet the fact the esseance of what the war was is not caputed in this film at all...Jews were cowering for there lives and made to do some pretty horrible and digrading things in WWII...so not surprsing someone made a Jewish revenge film...But if you want to really know what the war was like and ...this ain't the movie for you
5,Great flick,Brad Pitt does a fantastic job in this movie along with christoph Waltz. I have seen the movie 3x and everytime its as good as it was the first.QT does it again!
5,I loved all 17 hours of this movie,"Spoiler Alert!The allies win the war.Even though I just ruined the ending I promise you will still enjoy the film. I mean, come on. Brad Pitt and Eli Roth acting in a Tarantino movie? What's not to love? Also, a bunch of people get shot."
2,Boring!,"I think my biggest gripe with this film was the fact that, based on the title, I fully expected it to primarily follow the exploits of the Basterds. However, quite honestly they could have been left completely out of the film with very little effort--they were nothing more than background characters popping in every now and again. Pitt's character had so much potential to be interesting, but we never learn hardly anything about him and he quickly becomes rather generic. Similarly, the plot itself had quite a bit of potential to be intriguing and enthralling, but instead became labored and boring. I'm glad I waited for the DVD rental, rather than wasting money on the big screen."
2,didn't like it,It really wasn't what I expected... Tarantino takes a LOT of liberties with the history here
5,A Masterpiece,"Don't get mislead by the Red Neck approach, it is clever overloaded with cynicism and black humorYour attention to the fine actor introducing cruelty blended with cleverness, in short, the German Officer haunting its prey..."
1,inglorious basterds,this was quite possibly the worst movie ever...I found no redeeming quality to it..from the gratuitous violence to the idiocy of Brad Pitts accent. If you want to waste money then by all means buy it ....the rest of the viewing world won't miss you from it ranks.
1,Horrible movie.. even if it's a fiction,"It's a confusion of a movie, boardering reality and fantasy. The plot is boring and filled with cliches. I don't get it how people can like this film...."
1,Movie sucks,This was the worst movie I have seen in many years. I would not recommend this to anyone. The acting was like a bunch of 3rd graders who have never acted before.
1,Worse than La Bamba,"Don't waste your time and certainly give up brain cells watching this horrible, idiotic, laughable, nonsensical movie. To have the memory of this vile film burned into my head, knowing full well that I wasted 2 hours of my life that cannot retrieve makes me question my judgment. Tarantino must have been smoking crack during the writing and production of this regrettable joke."
1,Amazon streaming is horrible,I rented this movie from Amazon streaming.It was unwatchable. About 20 minutes into watching the movie - I got some kind of 'Buffering' message.Then it just completely timed out.I tried to restart the movie numerous times.After I completely lost faith in Amazon streaming - I switched over to a Netflix movie and it streamed just fine.This happened with another Amazon streaming movie.It will be a while before I stream another movie from Amazon.Also - I could not find a place to get customer support.
1,No Sound on Blu-Ray....Again,"I purchased the special edition of this product and once again, as with many blu-ray's, I am unable to access audio. The extras play fine but the movie is silent. My blu-ray player is not old. I do not understand why this happens. Forget blu-rays! Stick to regular old DVD's which work.UPDATE: Several people have suggested I check to see is my Blu-ray player software is up-to-date. I have checked my player and it indicates the software is current. I still have the same issues."
1,"Don't buy it, rent it or even watch it for free !!",This is the most stupid and boring movie I ever seen. I spent two nights trying to finsh watching this movie but I couldn't because It's very slow and alot of blah..blah..and some more blah.
1,if you'r a speed reader,this movie was a horrable dissapointment ... if you'r a speed reader you may enjoy it because it's all subtitled in english and spoken in franch and german. the plot is impossible to follow because you spend all your time trying to read what they say! end of story!!!
2,Brad Pitt is certainly consistantly ...,"mediocer! Congratulations: the first time we've had to see him when he actually keeps his clothes on during the entire movie. This story is interesting, but totally ficticious and it really should have been called: ""Vainglorious Basterds."" It didn't even have any HD stuners or relief for one second of what has got to be one of the most hilarious imterpretations of Hitler in history.Hey Guys, if you are going to make a somewhat historical movie, try not to make it a goofy farce!"
1,You dumb asses!,"if 70-90 percent of the ""Preview"" consists of the titles of the movie and not the trailer it is a waste of time!"
3,Better than Kill Bill,"In my opinion the showdown in the projection room should have been between the French girl and Colonel Landa, not the French girl and the young war hero. After all, Landa had just murdered the movie star to prevent whatever was to happen in the theater. His next move, like Frank Sinatra in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, would have been to go to the projection room to investigate.Landa killed Shoshona's entire family, so the showdown would have had more meaning with him.Also, it was not in character for him to negotiate a house in Nantucket. We see throughout the movie what a fierce defender of the Reich he is. He would do anything to prevent the attack on the high-ranking Germans in the theater. The deal-making over the bottle of red wine and the cutting of the swastika in Landa's forehead strike me as anti-climactic and rather stupid."
2,Over My Pay Grade Review,"Maybe I haven't watched enuff films to be able to figure out why this POS would be developed and actually delivered to the screen...I dunno, Diane was a phenom as Walz,but WHY??? Did the train roll off the trax in the EPs ofc and no one could say NO due to the Jew Killing Revenge scene??? Hitler didn't even look like he suffered as much as Walz did with the slice n dice screaming drawn (haha) out scene...The mess of dialogue and subtitles just made me insane and the plodding pace amazed me at my prowess of patience to finally see the damn cinema burn...BORING!!!"
1,Bad Discs,"I really wanted to see this movie. I've been a long time Tarantino fan. Unfortunately the disc wouldn't play. It wasn't system incompatibility but product defect. The main menu loop ran fine as did the main titles of the movie with the studio and production company, but then it never goes beyond. Screen goes black and nothing more occurs. Returned for exchange and second copy of the product failed to function in exactly the same manner. This was the Blu-Ray version. I've not attempted with a straight DVD--maybe in a year or two."
1,You can't fight terror with terror,Tarantino is a crude little boy indulging in sick little titillation films. More deeply sad than this film is how many people actually enjoy watching this kind of thing. It's just another form of horror 'porn'.
1,A waste of plastic,What an idiotic film. Don't buy it unless you have nothing better to do with your money.
1,Pointless and Moronic,"Tarantino's best days are far behind him with reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. He hasn't made anything I like since. He needs to stay out of the horror genre, the crouching tiger genre and whatever you this latest moronic blitzkrieg of talentless crap.If Tarantino's point was to ""kill Hitler"", then he didn't do it well enough. There should've been more emphasis on his death than just a few bullets in the face. After forcing my eyes open throughout the endless dialogue, the mindless action builds toward the end and just about everyone dies in this movie... so there's nothing I took away from it except the thought - why did I buy this piece of crap?"
2,"A lot of hype but, not much substance.","I waited until the movie came out on DVD and wish I had waited longer....like forever. ""Inglorious Basterds"" was typical Tarantino with blood and violence and little else to offer. Two and a half hours was way too long and the story was predictable in the extreme. Brad Pitt's character was certainly interesting but, not up to his performance in ""Snatch"". In this case I think the previews for ""Inglorious Basterds"" were better than the movie and it will be a long time before I buy a Tarantino film again....if ever. This movie was not even up to his efforts with ""Kill Bill"". I suggest he spend some time with Guy Ritchie and learn how to produce a story with a more interesting and less predictable plot and characters with more depth. I'm at a loss to understand why Tarantino and his films enjoy such a great reputation especially after seeing this, his latest effort."
2,Oscar Nomination? You've got to be kidding...,"Something between ""To Be Or Not To Be"", ""Batman,"" and ""The Dirty Dozen,"" but that is to place this film in company that is way too good for it. [I would especially apologize to Ernst Lubitsch].Tarantino has obviously made some fine films (""Pulp Fiction"" might even be great). But his monstrous ego appears to have led him to believe that he is to filmmaking what Bob Feller was to pitching, when he's actually more like Dick Radatz. Radatz had a few good seasons for the Red Sox, and could throw hard, but he didn't last. Unlike Radatz, however, Tarantino doesn't seem to realize that being on the mound in a well-tailored uniform is not the same as pitching a good game.A better medium for ""Inglourious Basterds"" would have been a comic book."
2,Unsatisfactory...,"I was never warned that this item was even shipped. Under ""Your Orders"", it still says ""Shipping Soon"". I never received an email stating that it was shipped either. Yet, I just received the item today in the mail. Something not right there.... Not only that, the disc has a nice scratch or scuff mark on it along with a few other small scratches. The movie froze up on me in the first scene about 2:25 into the film."
2,Don't waste your time,"There were some nice set pieces in Inglourious Basterds (German soldiers playing pub games while the resistance plots at a nearby table) but they tended to drag on. Two and a half hours? How long is the director's cut?The gratuitous bloodshed, ridiculous story and over-the-top acting sent the missus off to bed after the first hour and I had to watch the rest of the movie by myself. Thanks, Quentin. If I want solitude, I'll read a book."
3,INGLORIOUS BASTARDS,"NOT A BAD MOVIE BUT A TYPICAL QUINTAN TARENTINO STYLE FLICK. EVEN HARVEY KEITEL HAD A VOICE OVER ROLE. I PURCHASED IT TODAY, WATCHED IT ONCE AND I'M SELLING IT. IT'LL NEVER BE A CLASSIC KEEPER."
2,Humanity isn't so black and white,"I don't want to see some dude get beat to death with a baseball bat, even if he is a Nazi."
4,Surprise Yourself - It's Better Than the Reviews...,"I rented this movie thinking I would be watching two hours of a blood-soaked revenge fantasy (like Kill Bill). What I watched instead was a surprisingly artful film that tells me Tarantino is not yet out of creative ideas. Sure, there were two or three scenes of some pretty graphic violence, but the use of violence in the movie is not gratuitous. As some other reviewers have pointed out, this movie is not really about the ""nazi-killers"" led by Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt is hardly in this movie. In fact, Mélanie Laurent does some fine acting throughout the movie, but I must say that Christoph Waltz displays true mastery of the craft (for which he won an Oscar). You could do a lot worse in the category of Oscar winners and nominees."
