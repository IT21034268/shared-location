5,Excellent,Prompt Delivery. Correct parts. You can't do business with a better company. Hats off! I will definitely buy more products from this company.
4,Purchased Minn Kota MKP 3 prop from amazon.com.,The prop was exactly what I asked for and was delivered when they said it would be.
1,Motives for Writing,"I purchased this item on August 15, 2010 and it has not arrived. My daughter's college class ends October 8th, so I'm pretty certain at this point she will not receive the book in time."
2,Disappointed...,I bought this for my 14 month old son who loves to pretend he is driving. This toy seems way too babyish for him. The suction cup on the bottom loses grip 5 seconds after being secured. It has made it to the bottom of the toy box already. Get something else!
3,Impressive Packaging But Only Basic Features,"A thoughtful gift from grandma for my one year old son, who enjoys playing with wheels. It has a great presentation while it is in the packaging, but I was a little disappointed once we took out to play with it. The horn is a little tricky to honk, and you have to press it at just the right angle to make it sound. The gear shift moves up and down and the wheel turns and that's about it as far as features. Good for practicing hand coordination I guess, but my son did not seem to find it very entertaining..."
3,"works very well, but loud","If you're not worried about a little noise, this power supply is great. It is highly efficient and so far has been really stable for me, despite numerous stress tests. I only downgrade it's score because it's _not quiet_. I did a bit of research before buying this power supply and had read on several boards that OCZ had manufactured many of these with malfunctioning fan controllers and the units would always be stuck on high. OCZ replied by saying that they've pulled all the units that were defective but they must not have made it to mine. Fan stays on high no matter what. It's still not louder than my processor fan so it's not annoying, but it is disappointing because it's much louder than my stock PSU. Besides that, it's a definite workhorse and if you're not worried about noise it's a great deal."
2,DOA,"Well I bought this PSU long time ago but I forget to write a reviewThis PSU came DOA at the same time that mobo, both I purchased here on AmazonThe PSU never turn on, so I cant' talk so much about it OCZ has good quality on PSU's but sometimes the quality it's just relativeBut thanks to the Customer Supoort of Amazon they help me, so thanks so much to Amazon Support 1000/10"
2,Good while it lasted,"I installed this power supply in late November, early December of 2009. In August of 2010 it completely died on me.My PC setup includes a Radeon 4870, 4 fans, 4 HDs, and a DVD drive. I would not recommend buying the SXS600 if you have a similar GPU because I'm pretty certain that's what killed it. Fortunately, there's an excellent selection of new cards that aren't as power hungry as the 4870. Any of the 5XXX series should be fine (or earlier cards, certainly!)Anyway, that being said it's a decent PSU with everything you'd want for connecting peripherals, but it's something of a gamble from what I can tell. There's lots of reports of these power supplies dying, so if you can afford a better one by all means please do so.The saving grace in all this is OCZ received my RMA'd power supply and dropped another in the mail the same day, so kudos for excellent customer service and a very generous warranty."
3,"Good PS, not any quieter than others in its power range","I got this PS hoping it would be much quieter than it is. However its just as loud as the cheaper unit it replaced. I can hear it quite well 10' away so from that aspect I was disappointed. It doesn't sound like a refrigerator like some can, but is not what I call quiet. Otherwise its a good unit. The power cords are kind of longer than my previous one and I had to bind them around to keep them in the little space I had in my mid-tower."
1,Bad PSU....,"Pretty good PSU, cables are shorter than my previous GameXstream, which is good thing for me because it was really hard to fit those cable on my Antec P180. so far it works pretty goodUpdate: After 2 or 3 months this PSU just died on me for no apparent reason, I was downloading some stuff and set the computer to turn off when its over. When i got back home and tried the turn on my computer it just didn't had to buy another PSU. This is the second OCZ PSU that died on me in less than 6 months. I bought a Thermaltake this time, so far so good."
2,"great, but lasted less than a year","this is my first psu, i needed it for an ati 4830this is my setup>ati 4830 saphirecore2duo e2180 oc to 2.52gb ramasrock mobo wolfdale 13332 hard drives1 dvd burneris really silent, a lots of cables, they even have names for dummies like me, nice fan for heat, i read on a review this psu can work just the same as the 750w model, also it looks great and badasson the bad side, is really heavy, in my case that made the sending to venezuela a little too expensive------------editafter 10 months it died, just sounded puff and died, that is lame, nothing is burned but still doesn't worki hopped for a brand psu to last at leas 5 years, but i lost the money"
5,Works fine,This unit works as advertised. It was easy to install. I had to buy a 4 pin molex to SATA adapter because the 3 SATA connectors supplied would not reach all my drives. It runs very quite.It is worth the money.
5,CASTRO 'S MUSIC IS ANOTHER MODERN BLUES SIGN POST.,THIS RIGHT AS RAIN ALBUM IS ALL GOOD. CASTRO'S GUITAR PLAYING IS TOP SHELF. LIKE HIS OTHER ALBUM THIS MUSIC WILL OPEN ALOT OF YOUNG MUSIC LISTENERS EYES AND EARS TO THE BLUES. THIS ALBUM SHOWS WHERE BLUES WILL BE GOING IN 2K.
5,"A foot-tappin, hand snappin, air guitar'n good time","Tommy Castro takes a pinch of R&B, adds a jigger of motown, stirs in some soul and cools things off with some icy guitar riffs. He gets the foot tapping and lifts the spirits with his ever-improving ability to get into the right groove."
1,Absolutely terrible,"This album is filled with some of the worst song writing I've heard in years. It somehow looses all its rythum after getting started, and sounds like a pop singer trying to find what the blues are. Just when you think Castro is about to get started and play some guitar rifs, he doesn't hesitate to disapoint you! How dare anyone compare this guy with Robert Cray!!! Save your money, wouldn't recommend this klunker to anyone."
1,Ghastly,"If you have any interest in and concern for the written word in extended texts then this book is not for you: 95% of these designers seem to actively loathe it. It already looks out of date; grossly impoverished intellectually, this arty rubbish is of a piece with the poverty of contemporary trade book production."
1,Could Be Better,"The game was almost unfinished, like they had to get it out by a certain deadline. For instance the two cars on the back of the cd case aren't in the game. The steering is practically impossible without the steering wheel thing that comes seperately for like ... I suggest you don't waste your time and money on this game."
1,Roadster Trophy,"I have a Dreamcast hooked to my computer monitor via the VGA adapter. This game does not support this adapter, so I can't play it. It's a new game, so you would think they would support this display, but alas, they do not. :(So, 1 star, since they don't offer good graphics support."
1,Avoid this game at all costs.,"... Roadsters is by far the worst gameavailable for the Dreamcast. Potential buyers beware, the cover artis the only thing this game has going for it.The graphics and sound are terrible, but what really irritates me is the pathetic play action. It's almost like trying to play a video game that's on demo mode. You have minimal control at best. Nasty stuff. Don't even rent it.Crazy Taxi and Speed Devils are much better driving games for the Dreamcast, buy those instead of Roadsters."
2,could be better,"This game is alright. The turning is practically impossible using a controller. I suggest getting the steering wheel hook up thing. The boards are cool and the cars are better, but the gameplay is pretty difficult."
2,Kinda dated,This DVD set is geared towards older high school students or college students wanting a review. It moves quickly through a lot of excellent information. It would be good for an individual review where frequent pausing is possible. It is also dated. It doesn't mention the Bush/Gore election in its examples of a candidate winning the popular vote but not the electoral college vote. It also uses Geralidine Ferraro as its only example of a woman running for an executive office. And there's no mention of any minority candidates.
5,plantronics Bluetooth 665 charger,This charger is great for times when you don't have access to your computer. I would highly recommend it for those who travel frequently.
2,Didn't care for this headset...,"Unfortunately I have to buy a new bluetooth headset every couple of months or so because I lose them all the time. This one was no different because I lost it too, a few weeks ago, and replaced it with the Samsung WEP475 Bluetooth Headset which I like much better. Quite honestly, I've had a few Plantronics headsets in my time and I never really cared for any of them."
2,Maybe you can do better.,"I have never purchased this product before. I think that it would be well worth your paying a little more for a better ear-bud. Only had for a few weeks and it stopped working. Also while it was on it blocked outgoing calls. If the bud was on after I made call,it dropped the call. The company is sending me another one,But next time I will spend a little more and get something different."
2,Poor Connection,Charger connection to bluetooth is poor. It does not connect well and sometimes looses connection which causes poor charge performance.
2,No so good battery life....dear!!!!!!,"Hey,This product has excellent voice quality, but battery life....simply sucksssssssssssss.......so be carefull while buying,...I goona buy new one too./.."
5,Plantronics Charger,Great product; does the job. Inexpensive. Great shipping. Would order from this vendor again.
1,Always searches for channels,"Has a nice feature set, but beware. Like the other reviewers, my phone sporadically and frequently goes into channel search mode, which breaks up phone conversations. Intolerable. I've had cheaper cordless phones by other manufacturers that were completely reliable (e.g., Toshiba). In fact, this was my first disappointment with cordless phones."
2,jog dial runs away,"I bought this phone quite a while ago. It was great at first, but now the jog dial has just gone crazy. The slightest touch causes it to jump wildly (or not move at all), rendering it close to useless. I rarely get channel searching or static as some others have mentioned."
2,A phone that rots,"Very similar experience to most other reviewers here. It started out great, with some ""fuzz"" on the receiver's sound but still clear and audible. I used it happily for many hours of teleconferencing. Now it mysteriously drops out frequently, the voice quality has degraded, and the battery runs out too quickly. We've only had it for 6 months or so, and it is too soon for it to be ... out like this. I would give it a chance and buy a new battery, but from the other reviews here it sounds futile."
2,Not a good phone,"This phone didn't meet our expectations. We used it in the kitchen for a long time, and found that it is very hard to get clean, even with normal cleaning fluids.Battery life is an issue for this phone. Two new batteries lasted 9 months before they wouldn't hold a charge.When power goes out, there is no electronic memory for time, so when we have a power outage, which is frequent, we have to reset the clock. The outgoing message doesn't erase, so why not the clock???There is no speakerphone capability either."
1,"poor sound, quality","Bought this phone several years ago; should have returned it at once. Sound quality is poor and by about a year later, the LCD display began flaking out. The display and the selector wheel are now both useless. Battery has already been replaced twice and is dead again."
1,Junk,"I have the exact same problem one of the other reviewers noted. The phone will just die out in the middle of a conversation. The only way to keep talking is to run over to the base and move the phone by the antenna. What's the point? Calls to Sony provided absolutely no help. When the phone works, it's cool, except the quality on the recorder is pretty bad. I'm out here looking for another phone to replace this one. I love Sony products (I've got TV, DVD, VCR, TIVO, Receiver, etc,) but I will never buy a Sony cordless again. I'm not the only one, either. Everyone I know that has had one has been disappointed. I guess they can't be great at everything!"
1,A Very Poor Product,"This is a very poor phone and answering machine combo. Friends complain bitterly about the sound quality of the outgoing message. The sound quality of the phone is also substandard when compared to Panasonic & AT&T models. Finally, the incoming messages are almost incomprehensible. I own a SONY DAT machine and a television with which I am happy. But I have had consistent bad luck with SONY's other consumer electronics and I have recently learned of others who have had similar complaints with this phone. Don't buy this product."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I loved this phone at first, even though the sound quality was poor on the answering machine, both incoming and outgoing. Sometimes I couldn't even understand what the caller said the sound was so muffled. Running a business from home, this was unacceptable. But I was willing to live with it because of the investment and I loved the handset caller ID and the directory that was very handy in the handset. Now, however, approx. 9 months after purchase, it constantly does this ""channel searching"" while I'm talking, and it mutes what I'm saying and what I'm hearing until it ""finds"" a channel, even though there was no need for the ""channel searching"" because the connection was good. There is no way to turn this feature off. I even bought a new battery hoping that would solve the problem but it did not. Now the LED readout on the handset is blank sometimes. In short, DONT waste your money on this. What a disappointment from Sony."
2,Sony SPP-A973 Not Up To Par,"I've been a loyal Sony fan for many years which is why I bought the phone. Owning the phone for just over six months, there is some static while talking and occassionally cuts off. Although I have returned the phone to the Sony authorized dealer, they replaced the battery and gave the phone a thorough check. There was no improvement noted. I would pass on this Sony product."
4,"Pretty good wipes, but a little thin","I have been using Pampers wipes pretty much from the beginning and I really love the pop-up tub and the different fragrances they come in. These sensitive ones are especially good for newborns. My only complaint is they are thin. I usually use 2 at a time, more if my son has a messy diaper. I recently tried Huggies wipes and they are thicker, but they don't pop up. I don't like reaching in the tub as much as a the pop up, so I guess I'll stay with these."
1,This is too expensive...,"The retail price in local stores is 2.99, and you can get it in even cheaper price when it is on sale"
4,A good introduction.,"""The Elements of Reasoning"" offers a good introduction to using logic as a basis for making arguments. If you want to improve your skills of debate, or familiarize yourself with Aristotlian rules of rhetoric, this is the book for you. I read it and enjoyed it, although much of it was familiar and a bit obvious. I think even an observant viewer of Sunday morning political shows will be familar with the techniques covered -- inventions, conjectures, definitions, as well as the age old structures of syllogisms and enthymemes. If you are already familiar with such things, no need to read this book."
4,"I realy like the music, but the production values....","The music on this CD is really quite innovative and a load of fun to listen to. Track number 2 is especially nice, and has a storytelling feel to it. Overall the music is an excellent blend of acousitc folky sounds augmented with synthesizers that fill out the pieces and complement the vocals. The production values, however, really bother me. Some of the cuts are really ""in your face"" and could have been recorded at a lower dB setting. Others on the same CD are very quiet. If you set the sound for the quiet tunes you are in for a rude shock every now and again...."
4,awesome,"I have not yet bought this CD, but I did see her play live in Maui last week.... She has an amazing voice, you will not be disappointed!"
5,Hilarious!,"Love this movie...there are so many scenes of which I can relate to at my job. Funny Funny, you are guaranteed to laugh."
5,Classic,"Office Space has quickly become one of those cult classics. I cannot remember this movie even hitting theaters and I saw it after it was recommended by a friend. I immediately went out and bought it after watching it once. It is one of those movies that has classic lines and characters that you'll be quoting and referring too often. Personally, I would rank this as one of the 10 funniest comedies I've ever seen."
4,Good movie,I haven't seen this movie since I was young. I think high school years. I watched it yesterday for the first time in year's and I remembered it being a little bit more funny and fun to watch. Still was a good movie though. I like the guy who is always being moved around and just wants his red stapler.
5,Great movie great blue ray,Office space is a classic movie for your typical cubical worker. I have the DVD version and it looks kind of pix-elated on some screens in certain scenes. I haven't noticed it on my LCD screen with his blue ray version so I am a happy camper.
4,"5 Stars for the Movie, 3 for the DVD","The movie is absolutely essential for anyone who has ever had a crappy job. This is one of the most brilliantly constructed films I've ever seen, and will make you laugh out loud.The DVD is a bit disappointing though, as there is like nothing else on it. A special edition with commentary, outtakes etc. would be really nice."
4,cult classic,"This low-budget sleeper from the mind of Mike Judge is a quirky, funny film that cuts to the quick of corporate America. It skewers the hierarchy of the typical soul-stealing, cookie-cutter/cubby-hole workplace. You'll never look at a stapler in quite the same way again."
5,A very good movie.......,"When this movie came out to rent I new I had to rent it because I had not been able to see it at the theater.The poblem was it was checked out and video store usally has like 10 videos of a new release,so I knew it Had to be good.When I finally got to see it I thought it was so funny that Ikept rewinding it just see the parts I missed! I'm going to get this DVD today.If your looking for a great laugh,Rent this,See this,Buy this"
2,office space,love the movie but the copy we received did not play well. there were several skips dont buy it used just buy it new.
3,Flair edition.,"Office Space is a funny and offbeat film but I wasn't left wanting more from this cult classic. Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston give honest and sarcastic performances and Gary Cole, jeez that guy always plays a jerk! The ending was not that great so I can't rave about this 90 minute flick, this is a mixed bag for me, decide for yourself."
4,Office Space Is Funny,The movie is absolutley hilarious and anyone who has ever had an office job will love this movie. It expresses the views of the average american who hates thier job and will do almost anything to ad excitement to thier life. The main characters in this movie did an excellent job acting there part and were absolutley hilarious.
4,Office Space Review,"I have seen this movie and think it is halarious. This is a movie that almost anyone can easily relate to. Holding a job isn't usually people's problem...it's enjoying it that they usually find hard. These guys hated everything about their job...especially their boss(Lumberg). Unless you can find something about your job that you enjoy doing, it is very hard to make it through the day. So unless you can find something about the job you have that you enjoy, you are probably better off looking for a new one because one of these days you just may break down and do something stupid..."
5,A must for any one who has ever worked in a cubicle!,"This movie is a classic. Mike Judge, the man who brought the world ""Beavis and Butthead,"" surprizingly brings us an increadibly clever, fun, and a ""God I wish I could do that"" movie. Every one who has ever worked in an office will see this movie as the gospell. People can associate with every character in the film. Ron Livingston, also a bit part in ""Swingers"" was a wonderful lead. He plays the ""stand up and fight the man"" role to perfection. Well done, fun, and a must have in any DVD collection. Well worth the money, and something you'll watch over and over and laugh each time."
4,Office Life,"Exactly why i quit my office job, I laughed so hard, all while an intense anger grew inside me towards my old bosses. Damn printer !#@@#@, i hate you.The movie stays funny and on track at first, well at least through 3/4 of the movie and starts to get a little to serious at the end. However i own, love it, seen it too damn many times now."
4,Hilarious!,"I believe this movie started off as a 2 minute cartoon skit on Saturday Night Live, but that can't compare to the laughs that this movie will bring you. You'll want to get this movie, believe me... But instead of getting this movie, you may want to consider getting the limited edition collecters disc as it's loaded with extras!!"
2,Trying...,"The first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was 'odious' but I'll do it a bit of a service and say it's merely *trying.* I watched it on Amazon instant (I like the service but keep in mind I am no hard-core cinephile, my concern is the story alone, not so much the technology) and made it through to the end.I felt rather ragged afterwards. The character of Milton left perhaps the biggest impression on me - he looked and sounded and acted like a Muppet, particularly Beaker. That was a very trying element in this film. I felt like I was watching a strange permutation of James Thurber's The Catbird Seat, told in a backwards way from some unimportant background characters.The protagonist didn't feel like a protagonist. The only really wonderful piece of acting was that of Mr. Lumberg, whose dry, grueling ""that would be great,"" stole the show. It was grotesque and hilarious.Otherwise, this was a legitimately unsatisfying film. I don't plan on watching it again."
3,Very Funny,"This is is funny movie, but doesn't rise to the classic league of movies...the characters are extreme stereotypes of your typical cubical dwellers so common, esp. when the film was made. The movie's main character has to work with this pathetic cast of fellow office dweebs, and the end is a revenge fantasy...Not sure why the slow-mo parts are in the film at all. Add nothing imho."
5,"Yeah, we're going to need you to come in on Sunday!",This is an absolute must own dvd. Some of the reviewers here have made it very clear why you should have this dvd in your collection. A top 10 comedy of all time!
5,Hilarious movie,"I love this movie. It was on Comedy Central a few times a week one summer and I watched it every time it was on.Like Dilbert, it has something any office worker can relate to but will still be funny regardless of where you work"
2,Good for a few laughs,"This movie started out with some pretty funny bits, but it ran out of steam. You could see the ending coming from a mile away. Maybe Mike ran out of ideas. It just dragged on and on towards the end. As Butthead would say, ""What in the hell is this crap?"""
3,"Work sucks, and so does the soundtrack!","I actually thought this was a pretty clever movie, I found myself busting a gut laughing at many points. However, the horrible, drag-me-down soundtrack made me want to kick a hole through my speakers! If anyone can re-cut a version of this movie with real music, it would be one of my favorites. As it stands, I will probably never watch it again."
4,Umm...yeah...i'm gonna need you to...,watch this movie! It was recommended to me for a long time before I broke down and rented it. It is very funny. It encapsulates every piece of crap job or pain in the a** boss you've ever had. There is something in here for every working stiff. Wouldn't it be amazing if we just stopped caring about work? The irony that the lack of care brings good fortune. Don't be too doubtful. It just might work for you!
5,"Whaats happening? Yeaah, that would be great",Outstanding. And I don't enjoy other works of Mike Judge like Beavis and Butthead. This movie provides a much more subtle context for its humor. The facial expressions and interaction between co-workers are unconventioal and hilarious. See this with friends and the quotes will flow for weeks.
3,funny,"older but funny, good comedic acting by Melvin and a few others. The ending was good and I would recommend it."
4,Too Funny,"If you have ever worked for a corporation and had to be in a cubicle, this movie will make you laugh and laugh. I found it incredibly funny, and some of the moments were priceless. Recommended to anyone working at a large corporation, you will just get it and it will be funny."
4,A Classic any Cubicle worker can relate to,"A very light, funny satire on the life of the computer programmer and the world as they see it. This story covers everything from matrix management, jaming fax machines, business improvement, to the cuicle with a window view. Anyone that works in an office full of cubicles will relate to at least some part of this movie. I particularly like the aspect of the ""quality"" slogans and consultants that come in to ""improve"" the company. Many of us have already lived through this several times.Very entertaining with a pretty good cast of people you will recognize."
5,Brilliant,"There are two types of people who will fail to understand the brilliance of this movie: 1. The clueless 2. Those who are not experienced with American pop culture and all of its inane qualities.That said, you don't have to have experience working in an office to enjoy this movie. For me, it has a universal message in that most of what we do is not at all pleasant. To survive, you have to find stuff that amuses you (such as this movie). A must own DVD."
3,"FULL OF FUNNY CHARACTERS, BUT.....................","I'm sure if you work in an office this film may be a riot. While I thought it was funny and entertaining, there wasn't much going on in this film. The cast is very good with lots of quirky characters and it is certainly worth seeing, it just doesn't go anyhwere. You might want to check it out on cable before you buy it. This may grow on me with repeat viewings. Until it does, I rate it 3 1/2 stars."
3,How depressing - I can relate!,"I think that anyone who works, or has ever worked in a boring, meaningless job or just any kind of 9 to 5 job (i.e., just about every one) can relate to this movie in one way or another. You can't help but compare the characters to people you work with.There's the smarmy, fake boss who expects you to bleed for him, the people who constantly tell you stuff you don't need to know and the bastards who would rather ruin your life than lose one company dollar.Poor little Milton, one of the employees, just sits in the corner, trying to stand up for himself, but everyone knows he's a pushover. I try my best NOT to be like him!I watched this movie on a Sunday night, which gave me an even bigger dose of Monday-itis than I usually get. Best to watch this after you've won Tatts, so you can say, ""Hey, I don't have to live THAT life any more!"" Amusing comedy with a difference."
4,Awesome,"This movie was great. All the characters were soooo funny. Between the guy with a nervous stutter to the nerd who jams to rap music, I couldn't stop laughing. With a story line the everyone can relate to, and a scheme everyone would do. This movie is a great movie to rent if you need a good laugh."
5,For anyone who ever worked and hated their job!,"This movie take place in a office .The company is a Silcon Valley type operation.For some of the worker , it means possible lay offs,more work for others and some even get promoted.We see this movie though the workers as they toil for the boss(played the Brady Bunch's Gary Cole).The workers conspire on a way to get rich off their employer's accounts. The movie shows us what also happens at a restuarant when Jennifer Aniston works.One of the employees falls in love with her.Eventually the workers must find a way to return the money back to their boss.The ending was kinda what I expected with the employee who off in some dark corner finding something he was after the whole time! paychecks! Office Space is rated R for swearing(in speaking and soundtrack)nudity and violence towards office machines (especially printers! )See this movie even if you do not work in an office! any one who works (and who does not) can relate to this movie!"
1,Does not work,"I have ordered multiple items from Amazon and have never had a problem with any of the items I've purchased until now. This ""Office Space"" DVD will not play in either of my DVD players. I'm greatly disappointed in this company and will be sure to avoid Amazon purchases through them in the future if I'm unable to rectify this situation."
5,So So Funny,"This movie is hilarious. I recently gave it as a gift to a colleague and it was a huge hit. If you're looking for a gift for a co-worker who has any sense of humor at all, you cannot go wrong with this movie. Pairing it with the red Swingline stapler would be a great gift! :)"
5,Remember the memo,An awesomely absurd movie on the trials and trivialization of being a programmer in a large corporation. I highly recommend it. Just don't touch my red stapler.
5,A Classic Comedy!,This film is a classic comedy. It has a lot of subtle funny moments that make you laugh really hard. Peter's calm demeanor make for a great character that is just fed up with his life and doesnt really care anymore. Anyone who works or has worked in an office knows exactly what its like to be in his shoes along with the rest of the cast of characters. It's a classic comedy because it's so real and true to everyday life that people can relate to the movie and find solace in the film. It's all the things people in his situation wish they could do but never really could sacrifice there career for.
5,cult classic,"The ability of almost anybody to relate to this movie help elevate this movie to a cult classic. Upon the release of this movie, Twentieth Century Fox spent almost no money for promotion. In spite of this through word of mouth it has become an unbelievable success. Dealing with issues that almost anyone to relate to, relationships, dim-witted bosses, unruly electronics, frustration with the redundancy of bureaucracy, etc. has helped elevate this film to a cult classic. This is one of the few movies that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. Save yourself the money of repeatedly renting it and the aggravation of waiting for it to appear on network or cable television and add it to your dvd collection."
5,A classic now looks better than ever,I had the DVD edition of this and I can say the Blu-ray looks amazing compared to the DVD copy. The menus are not quite up to par with newer Blu-ray menus but the bonus features and commentary are great.
5,It's funny cause it's true!,"I haven't been in the work force for too long, but there's so much in this movie that i relate to. The sick thing is that so many of the gags are so dead-on to reality; you don't know if you should laugh or cry. If you work in an office (unfortunately) you will know all the characters in this movie. My last boss definitely had a good dose of Lumberg in him. All of the main characters are solidly funny, and it doesn't hurt to have Jennifer Aniston as the love interest. There's a moderate amount of harsh language and a naked girl on a TV for about 2 seconds, but nothing gross or in exceptional bad taste. Final Note: It might help to see ""Superman III"" before you watch."
5,One of the best comedies ever!,"As the title says, I can watch this one again and again (there is hardly a movie I'll watch repeats save for few exceptions like Office Space)."
2,Not That Good,"This was recommended by a coworker a while back. I was expecting something like a Dilbert expose of corporate America, but this was not that good. I do not know whether the role of the boss, the regional VP, was supposed to be a parody of a typical Silicon Valley boss, but it seemed to me to be merely lame acting. And worst of all, the central theme pivoted around an illegal act, which was very depressing and disappointing. I can hardly believe that Jennifer Aniston ended up in this cheap flick. Very dated, with some ancient computer equipment featured."
2,Ridiculous,"A slow moving slapstick comedy. Jennifer Anniston has again demonstrated that she is a third rate actress and is taking parts in ""B"" movies like this. Along with the rap music backgrounds and weak plot, poor direction and marginal acting, this is barely a two star movie."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Perhaps not the call-to-arms that office drones think it is, Office Space is a funny and warm comedy about the drudgery of modern life that captures the stiflingness of white collar toil better than Fight Club ever could."
4,One of the better SNL-related movies,"In case you didn't know, this movie is based on a recurring Mike Judge cartoon in the depressing 1993-94 season of Saturday Night Live. But the main character isn't the guy with the stapler; it's instead Ron Livington's character, who, after being hypnotized by a counselor into being more at peace, doesn't come in to work, yet gets promoted when new management comes in. Okay, so that premise is dubious, but everything else that happens in the movie (i.e., being in a traffic jam where a walking elderly man passes you up, numerous bosses coming up to you for making a mistake, new bosses come and almost everyone is fired) should hit home with you, and if it doesn't, then can I have your job??I got the DVD of this and I'm glad that they didn't stick any special features on here because they're always wack anyway. P.S. This movie is fictional, so don't do what the main character does in this movie. I won't give the plot away; just see it and see what I mean."
3,Did You Get The Memo?,"Another great movie here. If you are sensitive to swearing, then you might want to avoid it (also one brief scene of nudity), but the humor is great. This is a spot-on ""caricature"" of the office environment. Having worked in this type of workplace for eight years, so much of this movie really hit home and made it that much funnier. Great performances all around, but especially by Ron Livingston.I loved the movie, but gave it 3 stars due to the language factor."
5,Great Movie - Instant Classic,"This is one that EVERY potential office manager should be forced to watch. You will find yourself saying ""I know that guy"" with every scene. Really great, hillarious, definate Calssic right off the bat!"
3,Not the Funnist movie ever but youll like it.,"Amazon should get the year of this movie right it says 1999 when it came out March 1998 (I still have my stub). As for the movie youll like its humor and acting but some of it wasn't funny and the ending felt very very rushed (it all comes together in like 5 mins) but I could'nt get enough of Milton the mumbling loveable worker that still seems to get a paycheck,besides Jennifer Aniston there is really no mainstream actors in this but the acting is still pretty good, the humor won't make you roll on the ground in laughter, the humor is mainly chuckles but youll be smiling the whole way through. I have no idea why this is rated R the soundtrack is annoying and I think there was some swearing in it so it could the avoid the pg-13 rating. Rent before buying."
5,One of my 2 Favorite Comedies Ever,"The other being ""Better Off Dead"". It's witty, it's hilarious, and appeals to the GEN-X group."
3,PRETTY FUNNY,"GOOD,BUT UNREALISTIC.THE GUY JUST QUIT GOING TO WORK AND DIDNT GET FIRED OR ANYTHING!THIS MOVIE WAS JUST FUNNY"
2,didn't live up to expectations,"I was quite disappointed in this movie. The trailers, as is often the case, showed the majority of high points in the movie. It had its moments, but it dragged on, and the male lead had no energy at all and brought nothing to the film. I was also surprised Jennifer Aniston would lend herself to such a simplistic, afterthought kind of character. Surely she could get more important parts than this."
2,Oh! Thats how Floppy Disks looked like...,"It is a dry movie. Really, nothing worth watching. During the movie you expect to see something hilarious, but then nothing really happens. This movie might have been hilarious in 1999, but Amazon still listing it in top favorites is not worth it. Please watch something else."
1,unwatchable,"however, being somewhat obsessive, i couldn't seem to break free...jejune, almost entirely empty, and nearly identical to a very bad and lengthy sitcom episode, except for the absence of the obligatory 50s laugh track...in the first two hours of my promised and blissful afterlife, i may very well look back upon the final two hours, and realize they were wasted in advance on this deeply malformed creature feature."
4,funny,this film gets funnier and funnier vey time you see it if you hated it and only saw it once see it again if you liked it and only saw it once see it again it's an okay movie for kids over 12
4,If you liked Office Space...,"One of those films that gets better with each viewing. The first three-quarters of the film are excellent and worth 5 stars, though for me the last part of the film is not nearly as good. If you like this movie then I strongly recommend you check out a British TV series called 'The Office' which is fantastic. Only available in the UK so you'll need a muti-system DVD player and TV but well worth watching."
5,"Ummmmmm, yeaaaaa.......","Yeaaaaaa, I'm gonna need you to use the TPS report from now on....I really wasn't interested in watching this movie when my husband brought it home, but it is now one of my favorites! It's a cult gathering, and the minute you say those two little words ""ummmm, yeaaaa"" if you've seen this movie, you know EXACTLY what the person is talking about! I love Jennifer Aniston in Friends, but this is one of her better parts. It's small, but it just fits her. GREAT movie and recommend it to ANYONE who loves comedy."
5,It's all about the memo,"This DVD is a must for anyone who has ever worked a technical job or in any company that subjected its employees to the now ubiquitous ""cubicle farm.""!"
4,Office Space,"My friend hated his job. I got him to skip work one Friday afternoon. A couple of beers and ""Office Space"" and he quit on Monday. This is quite a nice little piece of work."
4,Guaranteed to become a cult classic,"Anybody who has ever worked at a dead end job in a cube farm will love this movie. A perfect, deadpan mockery of the unfulfilling lives of late-nineties white collar yuppies. If only they'd left out the whole Ron Livingston-Jennifer Aniston love interest subplot, I would have given it a five."
3,"Fantastic movie, poor DVD","This movie is wonderful, as you can read in the reviews below. If you've ever worked in an office, this is a must see.My problem? The DVD. Virtually no special features. For such a cult classic, the fans really need a special edition DVD. I guess I will just have to wait and read my office's latest memos until a better version comes out."
5,This is my life,"Excellent movie! I've rented it 2 weekends in a row now, buying it today...absolutely hilarious. The cast is perfect. Anyone who has worked in this enviorment can relate completely...you'll think it's your life on camera. With my company downsizing at the moment, this movie couldn't have come at a better time...life truly is to short to put up with the BS of the corporate world...This movie is just what I needed to finally make the decision to leave! WOOHOO!"
5,Hilarious,I recomend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humor at first I laughed so hard I was crying. It might be a little unacceptable for young children but I give this one 2 thumbs up.!
4,Live it Love it,"This film had me chuckling the first time I saw it. However I changed jobs and the movie made sense. If you have not worked in a place that has inane managers, not to metion if you have more than 1 that you report to, psychotic co-workers (Milton is my favorite)then you won't get this movie. I lived as Peter at my last job."
4,Sad how accurate this is.,"It really is amazing how Mike Judge captures all the intricacies of working in a cubicle atmosphere. The annoying boss. The characters that work around you. Hawaiian shirt day. If you have ever worked in a cube, you must rent this movie. It is hysterical."
4,realistically funny for the office worker,"This movie is hilarious.... I thought it was amazing as I watched it in college; however now that I have a full-time job, the funny parts of this movie are things I encounter on a day-to-day basis."
4,Funny movie,"This is a funny movie...It will keep you laughing, however...watch out for the dirty language...especially in the opening sound track. This is not for young children."
5,Comedy Classic,"Great humor always has elements of the truth. This movie is a cult classic. Watch it and you'll identify some of the characters from your own office experience. Let's face it, for the most part work [stinks] and Office Space does a great job of poking fun at all the reasons why. I especilly identitified with the themes surrounding the printer. I hate printers and copy machines with a passion. I loved the part where they take a baseball bat to the evil machine. And then there's the boss, Lundbergh - we've all worked for someone that smug and sleazy at one point or another. They you've got the crazy co-workers whom you're sure are certifiably insane. This movie hits the nail on the head in so many places! Buy it and laugh!"
3,"Silly, Cute and Profane","A pretty silly but good natured comedy with a vague underlying moral message of some sort. The characters themselves are appealing, but the sound track is comprised of hard core rap music with profane lyrics that you may or may not appreciate. Overall, this is not great cinema, but still provides a pleasant viewing experience."
5,One of the funniest movie's ever,"I was sitting home bored one day when I happened to catch this movie on cable. I couldn't believe this gem was overlooked in theatrical release. Talk about hilarious. After watching this movie I went out and bought it. It's that funny. Being a person who worked in a situation similar to the one our main character, Peter Gibbons, worked in I could totally relate to this movie. Made me laugh and laugh. All the characters are funny. Great comedy."
5,It was histerical,I was on the floor I was laughing so hard. You can relate it to your work as well with the jams with paper to dorky co workers and annoying boses
1,Poor satire....,"What a poor satire on office culture and a poor attempt on mimicing what is so successful in the Dilbert cartoons. I heard the movie was amusing, but when I watched it, I found nothing funny about it. I had to shut the movie off after 30 minutes of trying to find a good reason to laugh."
1,By far one of the worst movies I've ever seen... EVER!,"If you value your time and money, don't waste 10 more seconds thinking about buying this horribly bad movie. You will want to write to the producers and ask them to give you an hour and a half of your life back. This movie is a tribute to the eternal question of, ""Why do people keep giving Jennifer Aniston movies?"" I'm not saying that this movie is the worst one ever made, but without a doubt it comes in a very close second."
1,Not A Good Movie!,"Let me stress to you that this movie IS NOT funny. It may be one worst movies I've seen. I couldn't even sit through it. Don't even waste your time watching this movie, it will waste brain cells that could be used by something more interesting (like sniffing glue for example LOL...that is actually funnier than the movie gets) I suggest that if you haven't watched it spare yourself."
1,DUMB,"We saw this movie on a plane trip, and it was dumb. It wasn't even funny! Lame jokes, no plot, no ending."
1,AWFUL MOVIE,I could tell after the first 5 minutes that this movie was gonna suck. It was absolutely awful. I don't know where all these great reviews came from.
1,hate it,this would have been a good movie but the language ruined it all. will never watch again in fact will probably destroy it. language like that does not make a movie!
4,YOU HAVE TO OWN IT NOW!,"Don't spend time reading all the critics. If you're here, its because you have some interest in this particular movie. So, here's the deal: I'm from Mexico (and our humor it's a little different from yours), I'm not a fan of Beavis & Butthead neither King of the Hill, I dont know the Milton reference, I'm not in love with Jennifer Aniston and I only watch the movie once so many years before, but I have to own this movie now. Why? Cause I still cant' forget how great it is! pure and simple.Everything in there (story, characters, funny situations from beggining to end) is a hit. This is the kind of movie worth seeing 5 times a year (at least). Too bad the DVD has zero cool extras (an insult for the fans and the great movie that contains). Five stars for the movie, 3 for the DVD.Trust me: buy it, see it and enjoy it."
4,One of the best comedy's i have ever seen,"This movie is so funny, you have this guy working for a computer company and he's really sick of his life.... Until he visits a psychiater who gives him this special thought. So he simply stops doing everything he doenst like. It's great movie and has a nice plot. On dvd you first get a message to scan for a virus and he detects a hole bunch of them, so dont screek :) it's simply a joke. It looks great on dvd, no complains"
2,It's simply weak.,"Not agreat movie at all. I don't care about the performances (all of them good. Including Jennifer Aniston. This woman is gorgeous, astonishingly beautiful). And I loved the idea. Any piece of movie, paper, text, joke, about that awful consultants, that awful corporations, is to my pleasure. The movie shows waht happens when consultants are hired to ""aid"" the company: all the company wants them to do is to fire employees.But this movie is not funny. It's low budget, of course, but that's not the point. Livingston is not a very brilliant actor, and his performance is boring. The supporting cast gives their best, but it's not enough: they don't have enough funny material to work upon."
3,good plot but not a good comedy,I think this movie had a very good story but it lacked comedy.The only funny parts were with the guy that stuttered.But I think the story had a verry good outline but it had no comedy in it.So In conconclusion if you want to laugh go buy american pie.
2,not as funny as it looks,"office space has nothing to do with space.space office is a comedy about a person who has a boring life with a boreing job ""only does 15 minutes of hard work a week"" when he goes to see a counciler, the counciler hipnites him an dies, which mostly means for the rest of his life he will start to become much more happey, he decides with two friends of his to do a frowd on his disturberd boss who keeps on saying ""yeaaa"" when the frowd goes wrong they begin to have a problem. has many funny scenes in the movie and has very little boreing scenes in it."
1,"Poor, lackluster",I bought this video after reading so many great reviews of it. Even coming from an office environment I found almost no really funny parts -- for me the movie just dragged on and on - I kept watching waiting for it to pick up - up to the end...
1,Office Space - Secial Edition with Flair (Full Screen Edition),What a waste of time and money. Stupid and not very funny. I gave this as a Christmas present to a friend and was totally embarrassed after we watched it together!
1,A lack of quality.,"I was very dissappointed with Office Space. I expected great things from this movie based on the trilers the movie seemed like an interesting concept and something most people could relate to. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The only humor in this film are provided by two characters with about 5 minutes of screen time shared between them. I'll just say that this movie could have been done better."
4,Cubicles Beware!!!,"Office Space is a ruthless, no holds-barred comedy. Anyone who has ever spent even a day working in a cubicle will definitely appreciate this and relate to the characters. It's a different kind of Hollywood comedy; funny and clever. Ron Livingston is terrific and this is the kind of unique film Jennifer Aniston should do more often (no more Along Came Polly's). I enjoyed Office Space and recommend it to anyone with their own office space that they want to knock down and burn. This is a highly enjoyable and cute film."
3,He Had The Right Idea,"Ron Livingston perfectley portrayed the everyman who hates his job and is not afraid to show it! His apathy actually created sympathy in me because I can totally relate to hating a job so much that one just gives up.This film gets the right mix of humor and irony through Peter and the other zany characters that surrounded him, though I really did not understand the point of Stephen Root's character - he just downright annoyed me. I know every workplace has at least one freak like him, but, please! Get over your unnatural relationship with your damn stapler! I could have lived with him being totally omitted.Overall, the story and the cast work and the set decorators perfectly captured the blah anonymity of the typical office of the times."
3,"all right, but not great","I laughed a few times at this movie, and at a couple points, I thought, ""Aww, that's so mean,"" and ""Is that supposed to be funny, because it's not,"" but it's not really something I would watch again, I don't think."
5,Office Space Movie,"My favorite comedy of all time. I went to get my DVD out of my original DVD case and the DVD was missing, my roomate probably stole it among other things.So I decided I had to have it again. Today anytime I purchase new DVDs they are usually Blue Ray, yes even comedies."
5,What would I do with a million dollars? Absolutely nothing..,"Office Space could very well be the funniest movie ever made. Yes, that's a bold statement, but watch this movie, and you'll most likely agree! Is this movie only for those who have worked in an office environment? No, but those who have will get the most out of it.It's really hard to find many faults with this movie. The characters are developed well, Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead, King of the Hill) did a great job in directing his first live action film, and the story is amusing and easy to relate to.By the time you see this movie 5 or 6 times (beleive me, you will) you'll be reciting all of the funniest lines Monday morning at work. (There are more than enough to last for weeks) And that brings me to my next point. If you really dislike your job, watch this movie after an exceptionally bad day. You'll feel so much better afterwards! Just don't try any of the things that go on in this movie at work. You'll be fired for sure!"
2,it was aight,"I saw the bonus features&didn't really get the Hype of this film.Any film with Jennifer Aniston alone means the film is gonna lose some points because you the acting is gonna be kinda weak.i got some things of the film,but on a whole I didn't get what all the Hype was about.it had some funny moments,but it was fairly predictable to me."
3,"Oh, puleeze","I guess Mike Judge decided it was time to grow up a little. Very little. Office Space does have some lol parts, 2 (maybe 3). If you like tripe, this film is for you."
2,Left us a little cold!!!,"I don't quite understand some people. We purchased this movie based on the rather impressive reviews.... The movie has one or two laughs granted, but I sure as hell wouldn't make a big effort to see it again. The performances overall are weak (particulary the rather dreadful Jennifer A)as is the overall plot.Watch it...but at someone else's expense!!"
2,Not so funny,"I watch dis moovie an I no laugh. I work at intersections selling flowers an I like my jefe. Eef chu want comedy chu should watch ""In dee Army"", or ""Biodome""."
2,Why do people think this is a funny movie?,"I do not for the life of me understand all the hype surrounding this movie. Why does everyone love ""Office Space"" so much? There were a few times when I chuckled here and there, but overall this movie just is NOT funny. I do not recommend it."
2,Not really that good...,"When I started working in office (and a cubicle), all of my friends told me that I had to watch ""Office Space"" because it is so much like work and it's hilarious. Finally, I did get a chance to watch it... but I ended up being quite diappointed. Yes, there are some funny parts to the movie, but I was more disgusted with some of the supposed ""humor."" It could be that I tend to like movies that have some value or even a plot (even if it didn't have either, some HUMOR could have been good). I could have done without this movie, but at least now my friends will quit bugging me to watch it.Word of advice: I wouldn't watch it with kids or with older parents. Actually, I wouldn't watch it at all."
5,Yay!,"This is a surprisingly pleasing movie, whether you work or are too young to get a job. The film makes fun of work, all sorts. From Cubicles, to peppy waiters, to the wonderful ""ehs"" of construction workers.Ron Livingston plays a man who is tired of his job. After getting hypnotized, he quits caring about his job, and gets his friends to go in on a scheme with him to get rich by stealing bit by bit from the company. But, when one of his accomplices screws up and too much money is taken out, they have to worry about what they'll do to cover up to keep from getting put into a federal prison.The only problem I have with this movie is that its content got a little too needlessly mature for me. This film could have been just as good without all the cussing. But that's just one problem with an otherwise REALLY funny film."
3,"5 stars for the movie, 3 for the dvd","A great comedy that unfortunatley disappeared too quickly in theaters, Office Space is more subtle than say, Austin Powers, or American Pie, but is just as funny. The non-raunch low decibel comedy is a dying art form, but at least there are movies like this. A classic that I hope whose time will come, it is so much better than a Dilbert knock off that it got pegged as. The DVD is sorely lacking, however. As Mike Judge's first live action film, it would have been nice to have a commentary track by him explaining the learning process and of course making some jokes. The original ""Milton"" animated shorts the movie was based on could have all easily fit on the disc but aren't included here. Looks like the company is squeezing what money it can out of doing as little as possible for the disc. Hmmm..maybe they should have actually watched the movie?"
4,Hilarious,"Office Space is a great movie. It's one of the many DVD's I own. It's from the creators of Beavus and Butthead so you know it's going to be great. It comes on Comedy Central just about every weekend so if you want to buy it that's fine but if you want to record it and get it for free, that's even better."
3,OK!!!,"This movie was OK!!! It had some pretty funny parts, but most of the time it brought on more of a snicker then a laugh. I don't know maybe it would appeal more to someone who actually works in a big office. I think it's good enough to rent, but I definitely wouldn't buy it."
3,Good until the plot kicks in,"This film starts out in a very promising way, offering broadly stereotypical characters in a comically banal work environment. The protagonist's situation resembles that of Ed Norton's character in the brilliant Fight Club; both men occupy boring, empty existences framed by IKEA furniture and jobs of mind-numbing tedium. However, while Fight Club quickly veers into new and exciting cinematic territory, Office Space settles into a formulaic, predictable and utterly inoffensive story about inept white-collar crime.This isn't a terrible movie and, depite relying too much on the single most overused comedic topic of prison life, it does have some funny moments. I'm usually a big Mike Judge fan, but his brand of laziness works far more successfully in a short Beavis and Butthead episode than in this cautious and unambitious first foray into live-action filmmaking."
4,Interesting film... Worth watching...,"This is a pretty funny film. There are some really good scenes.The story is about a high tech company that has become top heavy with employees over the years. The head of the company hires a consulting firm to come in and review/fire the dead wood.Our hero become accidentally hypnotized into thinking that he needs to start doing things that are important to him, not the company.Anyway, he starts going (or not going) to work when ever he feels like it. He dresses anyway he likes. He does whatever he wants. The rest of the employees think he is crazy. The consultants think he is under motivated. They reccommend that he be promated.The things he and his friends get into are hilarious. The office is non stop cubicles....Jennifer is an added bonus to this film. Not a big part, but she in it often enough to be considered on of the four main characters.Good flick."
3,Damn witty,"This movie has an amazing script. Every piece of dialogue becomes a line that you end up saying to your friends at a later date. Absolutely hilarious, and upon further viewings you realize just how clever this movie is. The ""Damn It Feels Good To Be a Gangster"" sequence was the best cinematic part, whereas the rest is just brilliant character driven fun. Definitely worth the money, but the DVD itself doesn't really pack a punch."
5,great movie,"So funny; and it gets funnier each time you view it. Goofy plot, but has lots of ties to the reality of the workplace."
4,"Great Book, Helped in Emzone Development",Emzone develops state of art mobile applications for Sales Force Automation (SFA) . The Book iscomprehensive and helps for GPRS application develoment. It isvery helpful in Emzone current development.
2,"Lots of coverage, but lack of depth","The table of contents looks very impressive, with wide coverage and lots of fancy looking terms and acronyms, but the book contents are quite disappointing, lack of depth. Good for someone who wants to know the terms. Not helpful for developers and industry professionals."
3,Good view of basics,"Nice coverage of the basics of wireless communications, and trends in the market and technology domains. The CD ROM contains some useful tools, but was missing the testing templates promised on the back cover of the book. Since I work in SQA this oversight makes the book a major disappointment. If you want to quickly immerse yourself in the technology, this is a good place to start. If you are looking for meatier details, this book is not particularly valuable."
4,Excellent Solar Power Information Source,"An excellent book for anyone interested in using solar power. It's especially useful for anyone planning to build a new house. But anyone wanting the basics of solar (passive) heating and solar electricity will benefit.Paul gives an honest step-by-step account of his own building experiences, including the mistakes and what it took to correct them. I found the entire story very worthwhile and useful.If you want a solid overview of how to prep any house for alternative electrical power, you should read this book. If you're looking for practical info in the best use of passive solar heating, you can't beat this book.Jim, Montana[...]"
3,One Song,"I bought this CD because I had heard one of the songs played by a local DJ....album cost me $18.95 and the one song (I'll Be Your Baby Tonight) is fabulous, but it's the only song on the album that I, personally, like!"
2,Not satisfied,"This book is fun to look at but most, not all, of the recipes are extremely fattening. It is mostly made up of sweets and treats. There are a few healthy and nutritious items but overall you'll see nothing but how to make cookies, candy and ice cream. I don't recommend this book if you are trying to feed your children healthy snacks. These aren't snacks, they're desserts."
1,Very disappointing & dumb,Hi! I collect cookbooks and never give bad reviews but this book was awful! There wasn't one cute food idea that I would make for my child. I was hoping for cute snacks I could make for pre-school & this book was a waste of money. I got better ideas just off of the internet.
2,Sexy but cheap,"I bought the right size, and it fits well and looks great, but it tore and fell apart within 24 hours. It is also NOT crotchless."
3,Good Review of Available Methods,"Good overview of various plotting/graphing methods. On any given method, could probably find most of the information in a Statistic Program's help menu. The book's usefulness is in having these methods laid out for an overall review. In a sense, a reminder of what is available when you get stuck, or are in a rut."
3,History of weaving,"I wanted this book to be something other than it turned out to be, based on the title. In fact, it is a history of weaving, written by a man who spent his life in the mills, with special emphasis on the developments in weaving provided by the company he worked for, Craftex.If you are new to the world of commercial textiles and don't need anything more recent than 1973, this book may be a good place to start. Knowing the subsequent destruction of the American textile industry gives some of the chapters a bittersweet aftertaste.The book provides interesting coverage of the development and naming of rayon.Mostly, the book is a paean to the development of the power Craftex Jacquard loom, up to the early 70s. It is not directly useful to handweavers, except as additional background. The Craftex company is still in production, making fabrics for the commercial market."
2,Cute but not durable,This toy is very cute but it stopped working after one week. The handle was also very hard to turn to get the music to play. This was a real waste of money.
1,Poor mechanics,"We have owned this Jack in the box for about a month and a half. The music has already stopped working and we didn't even play with it on a daily basis, much less on a weekly basis. I wouldn't recommend this toy."
2,Not a good choice,Toy mechanism broke after 1 use - could not get jack to pop out of the box anymore. Could have been a nice toy if it didn't break so easily.
2,Not especially engaging!,"Altho I love the looks of this toy (bright colors) it isn't very engaging. For one, it takes too long to wind the toy to where the clown pops up. I think it's a cute addition to my grandson's toy box, but as far as entertaining him...it doesn't."
2,Cheaply Made - Breaks Easily,"""Jack"" doesn't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it. Don't waste your money."
1,broken,"Got this toy a few months early as a christmas present, but by the time the present was given and taken out of the package, found out it didnt actually work, and by then it was too late to return it. Would have been cute if it had actually worked."
3,Hello Kitty - Cinderella,The movie is really a cute film but we were disappointed in the quality of the film and also the length. The tape said 52 minutes but the film only lasted 25 minutes. Hopefully the others are better.
3,Hello Kitty Starring in Cinderella,"Irregardless of the actual animation, the corporation releasing this video chose to do so in Extended Play!!!! It is not a good policy for a company to shave a few cents from their product at the expense of picture quality."
2,Really old information and b/w photos,"The information in this book is good if you can slug through the boring format. I thought the imagine online was just a draw-in, but the book ACTUALLY looks like this. Remember generic beer in the 50s? A lot like that.JO"
4,awesome book,"Solid Vonnegut.The description that the cover gives doesn't really do the story justice.This is a twisted and dark love story, involving an empty man and his memories.Dark satire is woven throughout, as only Mr. Vonnegut can do.Not quite 5 stars, but only because I've read SH5 and Cat's Cradle.If I was new to this author, it'd be a different story.However, I know what he's capable of, and this isn't QUITE his best.CLOSE though!Highly recommended."
5,Mother NIght,"All I can say is, this book changed my life. I read it in the mid 70's, and have never forgotten it's message: You are who you pretend to be. So, you had better be very careful who you pretend to be."
4,"A great novel, but not the best","When I first read this novel, directly after readingCat's Cradle, I was disappointed. There was something there that I felt that it lacked. The normal Vonnegut wit and humor only surfaced momentarily. But after much recollection about this, I feel that it is indeed a truly tremendous and well thought out story about a man discovering his own inhumanity. I highly recommend this novel to the experienced Vonnegut reader, others should be weary. (Also see the movie! A great adaptation."
5,Mother Night,"Vonnegut is tied as my favorite author along with Philip k Dick, however that doesn't mean I have loved all his books. But I must place this one under the ""love"" column. It has Vonnegut's trademark sarcasm and satiric voice going in full force along with his mastery of subtle humor. I would strongly recommend reading this book along with others of his; more specifically Breakfast of Champions, Cat's Cradle, and Slaughterhouse Five."
5,At his best!!,Mother Night is Slaughterhouse Five without time travel nor aliens. It's hysterical and puzzling. A great book for any fan of Kurt Vonnegut.
5,"Vintage Vonnegut and much, much more!","In Mother Night, Kurt Vonnegut gives perhaps the most humerous(but still respectful) view of the Holocaust and Nazism ever thought up. As he always does, Vonnegut pushes the envelope of what is acceptable and while doing that makes us ponder if we're acceptable. WOW! I haven't yet seen the movie, but I can't wait. Even Hollywood couldn't screw up this astounding peace of literature."
3,I've Read Better,"I love KV. I bought this book because it received 5 stars where books I truely love like Blue Beard, did not. I felt there was less circular nature to the writing, the story was thready, the message less than inspiring. Definately not a keeper, I put it right back on e-bay. In contrast to 4 copies of Blue Beard I have bought over the years, I can't quote a single passage from Mother Night, nothing really excited me."
1,Mother Night,Good shipping but the pages were screwed up! At about 170 it reverts back to 79 and repeats 40 pages leaving 40 pages of the novel out! Terrible! How the hell did this happen! Check the pages.
5,Brilliant.,A brilliant book that examines the evil that humans are so easily capable of doing to their fellow humans. This book is a very fast read but it is worth it. Highly recommended.
4,Great read!,"Vonnegut's intriguing writing style continues in Mother Night. Very fat and interesting characters coupled with a precise probing of issues of conventional morality lead to a short, easy, and worthwhile read."
4,Vonnegut is a master,"Howard W. Campbell, secret agent for the US and a Nazi propaganda artist faces execution by a War crimes trial in Israel circa 1960. Will he be recognized for his service with the Allies or will he be executed for his crimes while 'playing a Nazi'? Vonnegut leaves us with a story of a man plagued by his on ambiguity and the consequences of associating one's self with the wrong cause. Very good story, very insightful writing; Vonnegut shows mastery."
5,Everything one would want.,"This is not a classic KV book in the sense that there is no science fiction element, but everything else one has come to expect from KV can be found. Even in such a serious book Vonnegut finds a way to add his dark humor without disrespecting his message. And as usual Vonnegut offers an original perspective on a topic that is commonly used. Any Vonnegut lover should make sure that this book gets entered into their library. This may not be Vonnegut's best (my opinion it is Cats Cradle) but it is still an incredible read. My only problem is the same problem with most of his books; they are too short. It always feels like he has so much else to say, but I guess we cannot get greedy. This is a book for everybody."
2,A bit disappointing.,"It's vintage Vonnegut, but doesn't bristle like Slaughterhouse 5, B of Champions, or Galapagos. If you haven't tasted the genius of KV, I'd suggest pushing this one to the edge of your plate until you've chewed on some of his other works.William Olson, author of Right on Time."
3,Well done but too weird for my taste,"Published in 1961, this novel tells is the story of a American man who lived In Germany and became a propagandist for the Nazis during WW2. Some of it is humorous. Some of it is scary. And all of it shows the workings of the author's rather strange mind. It's refreshing to read a novel like this and it is also frustrating. It is so exaggerated, absurd and satirical that there were parts of it that made me laugh out loud. Often, all I could think of is how the author's mind worked in such a deranged way. I found that refreshing.Yes, this was a satire. It's not supposed to ring true. It's supposed to make me think. And, yes, it did that. And yes, the author is a bit of a genius. However, in spite of his genius I actually hated the book and couldn't wait for it to end. At last the book ended and I breathed a sigh of relief."
4,salt lamp,I bought 2 of these for my daughter and her husband to use on their nightstands. I like the soft light that it gives off. I hope they enjoy them.
5,I love this book I can't put it down!!!!!!!!,This book was terrfic! It's about a guy named Jackson who sees this monster killing someone on the way to his aunts. Then the aunt starts to search for this monster. Then the aunt gets bitten and its all up to Jackson to risk his life to find this monster. But the bite on the aunt gets worse and the monster starts to control the aunts mind and she's going crazy! Read this book its great!!!!!!!!!
5,Spine tingling suspense on every page!,"AN Incredible book! Doom Stone keps you wondering what will happen on the next page. Not reccomended for younger childern, It even kept me listneing for that eerie ticking sound."
5,Doom Stone,"I give this excting book a 5 star rating.The book starts out as a normal trip to visit our Aunt, but then picks up as Jackson sees something at Stone Hinge. His aunt fills him in on the beast and why the army wanted her to look for this beast. They get a call that the beast is on the move. They take off in a helocopter and they are atacked. His aunt goes crazy in the hospital. Jackson finds out something that might help kill the beast but does not know where to find the Doom Stone. Will Jackson Find the the the Domm Stone? Read this amazing book and you will find out."
4,Review,"I thought that this book¡s fantasy was very interesting. I liked how the author described the Skull Face like if it really existed and had been seen. I liked the descriptions of Skull Face. That he is a human in the evolving stage and has a very deformed face. Even though the book was fantasy, I thought that the characters were realistic and that indeed characters like Alma and Jackson might exist in the real life. What I really enjoyed of the book was that it was fantasy and connected to the real world mystery of Stonehenge. I really thought that, that would be a perfect place for this kind of fantasy. I think that Stonehenge would be a perfect place because; in the real life it is a real mystery who put those stones there and why. Overall this was a book a thoroughly enjoyed."
3,Too Much Action,"This book is about Jackson who is going to visit his aunt Sarah in England. But on the way there he sees a beast, then the rest of the book is about Jackson, his aunt, and Alma (a girl he meets later in the book) trying to get rid of the monster. The book is great and has a great plot, the only problem with it is that near the end of the book there seems to be less and less of a plot and more action. The story deosn't seem to comlete vanish but it seems like Paul Zindel just threw something to go along with all the action. This is a great book for action-cravers but the story is too simple for me."
3,A Good Supernatural Adventure but Lacking Clarity!,"Paul Zindel's novel, ""The Doom Stone,"" is about a New York City teenager, Jackson, who goes to visit his Aunt Dr. Crawley who happens to be an archaeologist working at Stone Henge in the Wiltshire countryside of England. While he is there, he gets caught up in a supernatural suspense story that won't be spoiled.Anyway my biggest problems with the story was the lack of clarity regarding the monsters and species involved. I needed something like illustrations to help me understand the story's progression. Illustrations would have been nice and maps as well to help visualize the experience. There were times where I needed to read some parts again in order to understand but I shouldn't have too. It should be clear and concise.I would have liked to have at least seen a visual illustration about the hominids as well to help me understand and the whole mystery. Reading shouldn't have to be this much work."
3,cole k,"This month, in my english class i read a book called the doom stone. I give this booke a 3 out of 5. it was mediocer at best. The book, i thought, had poorly developed characters, i disliked the plot line, and the book wasn't really like the reviews said. I also thought the story dragged on about a lot of things. Don't get me wrong, I like Paul Zindel, but this wasn't my favorite book from him. That is why I give this book a 3 out of 5.The book The Doom Stone is a story sbout about a boy named Jackson who lives with his aunt. They go to England to stone henge to study attack sights. they find the monster and it bights his aunt. his aunt starts wierding out so jackson goes to find the beast. He meats a girl named alma and together the solve the mystery of the monster."
2,These Are NOT 100 Percent COTTON!!!,I ordered what I thought were 100 percent cotton handkerchiefs. These are NOT--and I'm returning them to the manufacturer!
1,signature collection handkerchiefs are polyester,I wanted cotton handkerchiefs. These are a polyester blend and have more of a polyester than a cotton feel.
4,Steinbeck is good but E.B. White is better,"Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize, Pulitzer) and ""Travels With Charley"" is a wonderful book. It is not in this collection however. I find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary (read Dickens for instance). In comparison, E.B. White had a gracious side to his writing, a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the English language. I like them both but prefer White. I mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time. They were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight."
5,John Steinbeck - great author - one of the classic writers of America,"The Short Novels of John Steinbeck includes some noteworthy books, like the Red Pony and Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck wanders around a lot when he weaves his descriptive tales. After awhile, reading Canary Row, which is included in this digital collection, I've come to the conclusion that he really likes to wander a LOT and develop his characters, and sometimes seems to lack direction in his story as a whole, but perhaps that's the point. Anyway, a great collection of classics by one of the more famous of American writers."
3,"Wonderful books, Kindle formatting problems","Steinbeck's novels are wonderful to read. I'm not writing this review for these iconic stories. My critique is for the Kindle Edition. I do love using the Kindle to read, particularly with a book like this that might be a bit large to hold for a long period of time. Yet again, and again, on the Kindle I encounter formatting problems that don't exist in the print editions. In the mad rush of offering all books digitally, publishers are not taking the time to make sure Kindle edition books are of the same quality. I've found may words in this book split in half (a space in the middle of the word), about every ten pages. It doesn't make the book not worth buying, but it is distracting and it can easily be fixed with adequate proofreading."
2,Where's the feeling??........,"Just got my copy of this a few days ago. I've spinned this disc at least 5 times since then, and nothing seems to impress me. I love black metal(usually the primitive sort), and love Frost's drumming, but this album justs goes down sour! There a few fleeting moments(track 3), but other than, it leaves me cold(and not in a good way). If you are a fan of hyperblast death black metal(Marduk, Setherial, Dark Funeral), then you might like this. One good thing, the vocals, sound exactly like Satyr. I'm still hoping it latches on to me later, I hate wasting money on CD's!!!!!"
1,No.,"I can think of nothing right about this book. Its one redeeming quality is that it was not the movie based on itself; it was, however, only slightly less disturbing."
5,very addicting game,it is a great game which in many ways feels like a metal gear solid meets resident evil 4 arcade stealth shooter and is very fun and hard to put down once you start playing
3,come on now... i wasnt real happy,"good- ai very smart,tough stages,tough levels,easy controls, character selection in multi-playerbad- music, gameplay can slow down, graphics werent the best ill give them a 3 also.ugly- sometimes the camera gets stuck behind a wall(gets tricky if your getting shot at), not enough weapons, multi-player arenas werent big enough"
5,"It's a cross of Metal Gear, Syphon Filter and Mission:Imp.","If you're a fan of Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter, GoldenEye 007, or Mission Impossible you'll love this game. This game has an excellent multiplayer, an even better story with one of the best plots ever and is plain out fun. If you buy one shooter this year by WinBack."
5,"Watch out Goldeneye, you've got a good rival.","This game is the best spy game in a long time. In Goldeneye, the enemies just stand there and shoot at you hoping to hit you. Not in Winback. The Terrorists will wait for you to show your head and then blow you away. And, Goldeneye's dudes will shoot at you if they see you or not. Winback's will wait until they see you. Winback: Covert Operations offers an exellent training program to teach you all you need to know how to do in the game. The ""Crying Lyons""(the terrorists) show some artificial intellegence. Winback's multiplayer mode isn't as great, but offers more ways to challenge one another. Overall, if you were to buy Winback or Goldeneye, go for Winback. Goldeneye is horrible compared to Winback."
5,Great and fun,This game has mild vilonce but no blood it is about a retired swat guy destroying a terorist ware house. Its Wonderful!
4,"Goldeneye, Metal Gear, and Syphon Filter all rolled into one","This game has a great multiplayer, a pretty good story line, and an awesome singleplayer. The tutorial mode is kind of lame especially when he tells me he won't be easy and I don't even get hurt. Thats one of the few draw backs of the game, but all in all it's a really good game whether your rolling around a corner or blowing a boss away with a shotgun or a bazooka it's fun game."
2,"Okay, but not worth the money","This game is bad. If you liked James Bond, like I do you might like this game. I disliked it because of the slow targeting and poor weapons. Some positives are the red dot scope, but don't be confused. James Bond's auto aim helps immensely this game requires many different buttons to be pushed. When you are shot you are incapacitated for about 1 and 1/2 seconds. Which is an eternity with how fast the computer fires. It takes forever to find your friends and when you do, they usually die. All in all this game is ok, but the storyline is bad."
5,Fun well worth the money buy it!,"This is a extremely fun game it is hard though on your first time playing it. It took me and my friend a couple of days to beat the first level.it has a lot of sercrets to unlock such as sudden death mode,trial,max power however you do not need cheats! to access these modes I beat the game on hard and got all of them.The multiplayer aspect needs some serious work(larger levels,with more detail),but after just beating the game you can use all of the bosses in multiplayer mostly its a good game and could probalbly hold its own at a arcade its well worth the money!"
4,Metal Gear Solid For N64,"This is a game worth buying. there isn't blood so your mom wont be upset. It has a good idea to it but there are several cons. There arent the huge arsenal like in most games. Also the controls can be annoying. But I am not going to just talk about the bad stuff. There are lotsa cool things to do like C4, Its so much fun to detonate on an enemy. The multi player is pretty bad though it is pretty pointless. If you dont like 3rd person shooters and woult prefer 1st order Perfect dark it will be a 1st person Winback with tons of guns, Charecters, Missions and best of all bots(CPU charecters) in the multi-mode"
3,...,"... I'm reviewing Winback: Playstation Operations. This is nothing but a cheesy playstation game Put onto 64! They must of needed somthing to keep 64 fans busy while they make somthing else! Frankly, Its preaty lame. Ive seen better and worse. I recomend borrowing this with a players guide from a friend because its not worth buying thats for sure!"
2,Winback lacks several qualities,"WInback is a good game, but because of the difficlut controls, bad camera angles, and Jean-Luc's (your character) stupidity makes it only a so-so game.Because of the manuel cameral you have to continously switching the angles to see who you are shooting at (if any one at all), who's shooting you, or where youa re going so that you don't run into those damn lasers.Your character also lacks basic moves that almost every other 3rd person shooter has. He can strif (move from side to side), crawl, or even jump. the most impressive move he has is that his is allowed to crouch. you would thing that i specially trained, counter-terroist unit would atleast be able to preform those simple ablilties"
3,"Rah, rah, & bang, bang","Sigh.This was a disappointment. Anyone coming into this series without prior experience of the first 2 novels might have found it somewhat incomprehensible. And I, at least, having read with intense pleasure almost everything the author has written in the SF/Fantasy line, found this not up to his standards. Pretty shallow and more of the same ol' same ol'.I will admit that the glimpses of parenting techniques shown with Jimbob, heir apparent to the country, showed promise. [smile]I was especially disappointed in the lack of treatment of the dark-song drummers, especially after the build-up in Book 2. I guess the book is better than being totally bored, but it is not one I would recommend whole-heartedly to newcomers."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An aging Anna is still the boss, but she still struggles to gain respect. Her regency charge is almost an adult now, and does some of the usual teenage things. She has to try and prepare him for his role through all of this.The local rich guys are not a big fan of how good you are at your job being more important than whose womb you came out of, but this is the system Anna is instituting.She finally comes around to the idea that getting laid might be good, too."
2,Not His Best Effort,"Unlike the other volumes in the Spellsong series, I felt the characters in Darksong Rising were predictable and offered no depth. It seemed that Anna is faced with the same issues she faced in the last book. The villains are all one dimensional, power hungry, bigoted males. While these characters no doubt deserve their punishments, I would not want to read about them over and over again. This book was a disappointment."
4,A good third novel in the series.,"This novel further develops the story and characters of the first two books. There are no surprises and the novel is comfortable, easy to get back into. I'm looking forward to the next novel."
4,Anna continues to change the world,"""Darksong Rising"" is a worthy successor to the two earlier books in the series. Anna is a believable (and enjoyable) character, and her attempts to wrestle with a new world are good entertainment. The transformation of Defalk continues, and her efforts make a really enjoyable read. Yes, she does whine a bit much about her exile from her children (although in this one at least a hint that she might be recognising that her new life is better). Yes, her sexual frustration over Jecks is also a bit much, too often. But she is entitled to some complaints, given the calls made upon her for selfless sacrifice to help others. I agree too that we could do with a bit less of the ""men are dreadful"" line. But her magical conflicts are excellent, and I would recommend the series to any fan of fantasy."
5,Great book for teaching how to deal with feelings,"This is an old book, but the information in it is timeless. A boy about 10 relates short common situations and events that happen to him and how he felt. Then on the next page is a brief paragraph on how he dealt with the situation and how that impacted his feelings. Great for teaching children about thoughts and feelings that go with problems and how to handle them."
5,The definitive narrative of Lincoln's army,The premiere work from the War Between the States' best author. I've read nearly all of Bruce Catton's Civil War work and this one is the best--buy it and read it again and again.
4,Good overview of the civil war,"I was half way through the first volume of Foote's epic 3 volume ""The Civil War: a narrative"" when I paused for a breather and read Catton's Hallowed Ground.So, compared to Foote's 3 volume The Civil War, Catton's Hallowed Ground provides a good overview of all the major battles in the Civil War. He had also included quotes from letters soldiers had written to family which I thought was a nice touch as it provided a different view of the civil war and illustrated how tough things were for them. What I also liked about Catton is that he had referenced the quotes and pointed to other books if you were interested in that particular regiment or battle.For someone new to the civil war, I would definitely recommend reading Catton's Hallowed Ground first then refer to Foote for more detailed description of the more interesting battles. However, as another reviewer here points out, there is a hint of bias in favour of the confederacy in Foote."
2,"""Dont [spend] your Money""","I fell into the huge mistake of looking at the cover of""Roadsers""and thinking it might be cool!WRONG!When I finally recieved this game for the PS1,I put it in my playstation,and was let down right away!!!!The visuals ""[stink]"",and are horrible to watch!The game play is about as fun as watching flys on the wall!I for sure regret this purchase!What ever you do,dont fall in the same mistake I made,purchase""NFS High Stakes"",or""Test Drive Le Mans""if you want a good racing title!"
5,"Spectacular film, beautiful cinematography","This film is AMAZING. Its now on my top ten list of the best films ever made.Great character development, and full of irony.It makes viewers realize how trivial and unimportant ""things"" are. It also makes me sick of American culture, because simplicity is not an acceptable part of life here. I gained a greater appreciation of what I have and that I don't need more. I love movies that make me think!"
5,Nowhere in Africa,"It's a special form of torture to watch DVDs that feature Africa's natural beauty when you live in China. The typical movie about what the Nazis did to the Jews doesn't make me feel a damn thing. They're so heavy-handed that all I come away with is blunt force trauma. This one's different. A family ran like hell to Kenya or Nairobi or some damn place in Africa so isolated that it doesn't even matter what we call it. Think of all the obvious themes you can. Then stretch your imagination and come up with a few more. All are covered here, with a subtle hand, and you feel it. Powerfully. You're moved. You cringe over here and laugh over there, and in this other place you just get kinda disgusted with some people. Autobiographical, and it deserves its Oscar and its other awards."
2,Hmmmph!,"Another timultuous love story concerning white people playing out against the harsh backdrop of the perrilously breathtaking Kenyan landscape. Sensitively handled, but doesn't really have that post-colonial edge which would have made it outstanding. The 'Africans' in this story are presented as little more than caricatured plot machinations, dragging the film toward its conclusion."
1,What started out to be a beautiful movie....thrown in the trash!,"This was recommended to be a wonderful movie, not to be missed, in our local small town paper.Indeed it started out to be just that, even with viewing it in-between the English subtitles (German made, German language) Magnificent scenes of Africa, and beautiful people all through out. Then, right in the middle, and totally unnecessary by all standards, very graphic sex scenes between 2 of the characters. I could not believe it! It ruined what could have been a totally beautiful movie in scenery and story. I was so angry I immediately threw it in the biggest trash can I could find. I was so angry I didn't want to talk about it, let alone give time to write a review, until now. Enough said, don't waste time or money on this movie. I still have yet to speak to the man who wrote the recommendation but will the next time I see him. (I live out in the wilds of our Island, not in the town)"
2,Subtitle Nightmare,"Looks like a great film, only... can't understand a word. Germans hear and understand all the dialogue while those of us who know only English have to figure out what's being said and, more importantly, what's being felt. Subtitled questions go unanswered. Beware this DVD. My wife saw this film in a theater and swears the subtitles helped her follow the story. This DVD does no such thing. Know German, or else."
4,Very good movie.....very bad subtitles!,"I wasn't able to enjoy the movie as much as I would have if only the subtitles were adequate to support the power of the movie. As a result, I wasn't able to fully appreciate the deepness and complexity of this cultural diversified movie. Anyhow, I still would like to recommend this to everyone especially those who can understand German. Definitely an Academy Award material!"
4,"German Yes, English No.","This was an excellent film. It didn't seem to run long as some reviewed. So many events occurred in the film, I thought more time went by than actually did. This film would have received 5 stars, but Amazon has it listed as having both English and German versions on the disc. It only has German with English subtitles. Fortunately I understand German, so this did not deter from the film."
5,Beautiful Cinematography; Beautiful Story,This is yet another movie that I've had on my list for years and finally rented (gotta love [...] deals) and I'm so glad I did. I can't wait to read the book too. I had no idea that during WWII some Jews escaped to Africa. This movie follows one family's struggles surviving and acclimating to live in Africa. Phenomenal work. Yet another example of why most foreign films are quite a bit better than ours lately.
4,Unexpected Pleasure!,"Caught this unexpected pleasure, on a motel room T.V.. It is a rare, fasinating, high quality Cinematography, educational for all ages, and a highly unusual ""inside"" look into a horse's world! I'm ordering one for Doc Beeman, who is a world known equine vet,and the rest as gifts to myself, and grandchildren."
4,Set in Namibia?,"This movie was filmed right near where I live and I'm really impressed with how it turned out. But I'm puzzled by why it says it takes place in North Africa... when actually it's South West Africa... but anyway, the photography is brilliant. The story is perhaps aimed more towards younger viewers, but it can still be enjoyed by the whole family."
3,NOT for sensitive veiwers,"Overall, this movie was very enjoyable BUT it has some pretty disturbing scenes, that my young children found pretty upsetting. Be prepared to debrief little ones...."
4,"Patzak, another Viennese Charmer!","This CD of operetta items and Viennese songs contains some of the most charming and delightful singing ever recorded.Just sample the Goldsmith of Toledo aria (not Viennese - by Offenbach!). If that has no appeal for you, it is unlikely that the remainder of the music would be of interest either.Julius Patzak, although lacking that warmth of tone so much the property of Richard Tauber, nevertheless runs his great colleague a near race for the position of most genial, winning tenor in presenting lovely, romantic, lilting melodies.Only some slight harshness in the sound of these transfers precludes what otherwise would be a very well-deserved, 5 star rating."
5,The Perfect Paula Performance,"I was so excitted to find this on DVD, I grew up #1 FANS OF Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul. They were very popular at the same time but Paula was never able to capture the audience of the mid 90's with her follow up to Spellbound, ""Head Over Heals"", instead Janet took over. I think it's a shame we lost her as a recording artist and performer. I remember seeing Paula for the first time in December of 1991, in Phoenix,AZ,when I was 13 and in the 7th grade. It was ""The Under My Spell Tour"" and I was so excited to finaly see her Live. I saw her in ""92"" as she performed her encore perfomance, and I became so dazzled by her performance. She was truely talented. I wish she would make a come back! At least I can re live my Paula fanatic days with this performance."
5,Makes geology fun,"While the lessons are enjoyable, the awesome hands-on activities in the Kaleidoscope Books are what set this series apart from other books. Kaleidoscope Kids Geology contains directions for the ultimately cool baking soda and vinegar bubbling volcano (or couse). Other hands-on fun included in the book also include making adobe bricks with grass and mud. Yes, your school day can officially be about playing in the mud! Like all of the Kaleidoscope Kids Books, the Geology book is full of one hands-on activity after another as kids learn about types of rocks, the Mohs' Scale of hardness, volcanoes, earthquakes, even which birthstone represents which month."
5,fun things to do,The book has a wide variety. You're sure to find something that you and children can do together. The kids thought they looked to be fun when they glanced through.
3,Familiar Territory,"I've looked over the book, and a friend who teaches science from ages 6-14 read it. It covers a lot of familiar territory found in other books. There were very few interesting or unusual new ideas presented. It would take more than presented here to get a young student interested in geology."
4,Grofe speaks Dutch!,"Basta Records, a Netherlands-based record label, continues to impress with their Ferde Grofe recordings. The latest offering includes 'Tabloid Suite', a little known work, along with the familiar 'Grand Canyon Suite'. The bonus disc is Gershwin's 'Concerto in F'. All are presented in their original Jazz Band orchestrations, which were commissioned by Paul Whiteman. Moreover, that are presented without any cuts to the music [ie. previous 78rpm recordings of 'Grand Canyon' and 'Concerto in F' featured shortened versions, which were taylored to fit the length of the discs]. Good sound and excellent, informative annotation. Highly recommended."
3,Devils and Dobermans..,"In ""The Devil to Pay"", Jayne Ann Krentz clearly shows the foundations of her trademark style. Emmy Stratton and Julian Colter strike sparks from their first meeting (and we have to love Xerxes the dog). Written in the mid '80's, Jayne reaches a point where she allows her heroines to be feisty, opinionated and to take risks - some with the hero - there is much less surrendering here and much more mutual satisfaction. The dialogue is delightfully witty (another soon-to-be-Krentz trademark) and the plot is carefully crafted as always. If you are looking to spend some time watching two lovers stumble into their future together, this is the book for you."
4,The (Unintentionally) Longest Read I Ever Had,"I first began reading this book while visiting a relative over 25 years ago. The visit ended before I could finish the book, and then the relative got rid of the book during a move. Every so often over the years I would search for the book (partially because I wanted to know how it ended, and partially because the memory of reading the book as a child was a particularly poignant one) but to no avail, until I finally found it on Amazon last year. To be honest, the book was not quite as riveting as my imagination had built it up to be over so many years, but it was a solid read, with interesting characters, a strong sense of time and place, and a satisfying ending. It now has a place on my bookshelf, for me -- and for others, to enjoy."
4,Generally exciting account of the Oregon Trail,"The Oregon Trail by Francis Parkman is an account which further enforces the history of the Oregon Trail we had learned about in [U.S. History] class. The book portrays what it must have been like to travel on the Trail, never knowing what the next day would bring. The buffalo hunting which took place throughout the book became monotonous and boring after the first exciting few, but other than that repetitiveness, the journey was well depicted. I especially enjoyed Parkman's in-depth descriptions given to the reader of the people he meets on his journey and his observations on their actions as well. His vivid imagery of scenes from nature such as animals, prairie landscapes, and the weather, place the reader right next to Parkman in his adventuresome expedition. There are some dull, repetitive points in the observations made by the author, but aside from that his autobiographical telling of his journey is unforgettable."
4,Interesting,The book puts the reader on the wagon trains and provides great insight into the day to day travails of the Oregon Trail travelers.
2,Hardly the Oregon Trail,"This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it. It was my hope to read about the settlers moving West on the old Oregon Trail but this book had nothing to do with that. Instead, it was an account of Parkman's experiences as he traveled in some of the Western areas of the U.S. (Wyoming area, Black Hills, etc.) Much of his time was spent with the various Indian tribes as he befriended them and learned much of their culture. He also spent a great deal of time hunting. My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive. Many of the accounts were similar and it seemed like we were going over and over the same thing. I read almost every thing I can find on Western adventure and exploration but this one is sure not on the top of my list."
4,My 1 year old approves,She got this toy for her birthday and just loves it. It keeps her occupied the whole time while I am getting ready for work. Her favorite side is the shapes. She will take them out and put them back in over and over again. When she pushes on the shape she will wiggle and bob her head to the music. A good value for the price.
2,music morphed out,i purchased this when my child was a few months old. she loved it because of the sounds of the animals. as she got older she enjoyed putting the pieces in their places. i have returned it twice because it doesn't work. each time i change the batteries but it still doesn't work. i will return the second and call it quits. the concept is great and when it works it's good but now my child is 18 months and it frustrates her.
3,Not as great as the reviews would have you believe,"I was surprised that this toy got such good reviews, because I am not at all impressed with it. I thought that both of my sons (12 mos. and almost 3 years) would enjoy it, but neither has spent much time with it, despite enjoying other shape sorters - plus, one loves music, the other loves animals/making animal sounds. The shapes are hard to get out, and this frustrates my 1-year-old son. And I was disappointed that the music doesn't play when the shape is inserted; you have to press the shape after putting it in to get the music to play (or bypass that, and push the little button to get the music without even doing the shapes)."
5,makes my face very soft,"I went for a facial the other day. The final result didn't make my skin as smooth or as soft as just my own home facial and seacret face cream does. I use this lotion as a day lotion, when I stay indoors and don't need sun protection. The results are instant and my skin gets very soft."
1,Not a happy customer,"This seller claims that if not satisfied with the product, they will issue you a refund as long as you send the product back within 30 days. Well is almost a month since I send the products back and I havent seeing no refund yet. I tried calling and sending the seller messages with no luck they wont return my calls or write. I also think that phone number given is fake, because nobody ever answers the phone."
4,Illustrated Automotive Dictionary,A simple easy to understand explination of a complex subject. Not required reading for engineers but if a machanic has you bamboozled this book could help.
5,Great gift for the enthusiast...,"This makes a great gift for the car enthusiast. Nice references and illustrations to common automotive terms. I originally bought it as a gift, but later purchased one for myself too."
5,quick reference to automotive engineering,I found this to be a useful tool as a quick reference to automotive engineering.
5,Like it a lot,"This is one of those oils I would buy again. It smells great, nice to put on after you shave your legs or just rub on to smell nice."
3,Very Strong Scent,"I did not so much enjoy this product. The scent is very strong and the oil is very thick and takes a while to absorb. If you're looking for a light oil this is not it, but if you're into rich oils you may love this product."
2,Too thick,"I was looking for an everyday body oil but this is too thick for everyday use, but o.k. for massages."
2,Did not meet my father's needs.,I bought this for my father who has severe hearing loss and wears 2 hearing aids. It really did not improve his ability to communicate over current phones that he has. Good feature was that it lit up when he received an incoming call. I will probably be looking into a captioning phone for him next.
1,Static,"Could be a characteristic of all amplified phones, but this one had static everytime the boost is used. Returned it."
1,Machine didn't work,"Granted this probably isn't the rule, but I received a non-functioning unit. I received no replacement, but did receive a full refund."
2,Another disapointment,"All MC5 fans are hoping that a concert as clean as ""Jams"" will someday surface. (W're also hoping that Electra will release the complete ""Jams"" sessions!) But this CD is just another collection of non-soundboard live recordings. Not too listenible and even less entertaining. So far the only postumous MC5 CDs worth picking up are ""Babes In Arms"", ""Thunder Express"" and ""Big Bang"".(MC5 fans should sniff out Rob Tyner's incredible solo swan song ""Bloodbrothers""!)"
2,"A great attempt, but quite possibly a lemon.","I bought one of these players two years ago. Within two months (fortunately during the warranty period), the lens knocked itself out of alignment, keeping the player from even seeking to the beginning of the disc. The Sony repair technician replaced the lens assembly, and all was well for about 6 months, after which the player developed a problem in which it would abort playback, clear memory, and reset the player. This happens when the player moves at all suddenly - not good at all for walking, and I wouldn't even CONSIDER jogging with it. Great sound, average battery life, almost unrivaled skip protection, but little to no reliablity in my case."
5,Arrington the Great!!,I love the Arrington Jersey so glad that it is available on my favorite website!!!!!!!
5,Amazing fit!!!,"I have never, ever, ever in the history of owning my Prius found a sunshade that didn't fit like crap. My hat is off to these guys. It fit like a glove."
2,Ho-Hum........,"With all the great material in the WEA vaults, why Warner Music UK chose to package and release these also-rans is a mystery. The material has a boring sameness to it I am not used to in an Oldies Collection. Dee Dee Warwick, Darrow Fletcher, Barbara Lynn & Mary Wells are all outstanding artists that I normally look forward to listening to, but who you would not normally identify with the disco or pre-disco period of American music. The selections on this CD display these and other artists' work out of their normal areas of expertise. This one is surely going to a back shelf."
3,Joint Health,These are fine with lots of vitamins and minerals in them. I have not personally seen a change but I know that others have.
3,"I Love the Glasses.....but they are very, very, very fragile.","Over the past 4 years I have purchased 3 sets of these glasses. The final one broke last week. Now I have none.I've never had a glass that ""felt"" so right...light, smooth, clear...simply made drinks taste better. Sounds silly but it's true.BUT----these glasses are fragile. And I mean SUPER fragile. Just placing them IN the dishwasher can lead to breakage. Shutting the DW door must be done softly. Even when hand-washing them, they can break. I actually had one break when I sat it down too hard on a granite counter top.All this being said, I'm ordering a couple more----while they're intact, they're awesome."
2,"Pretty, but not durable","I bought two sets of these glasses and so far, after only a few uses, two have broken. One in the dishwasher and one during hand washing. Perhaps the glasses I have were defective, but be forewarned that these are very fragile. That said, I do have other Riedel O (Merlot) and H2O (water/juice) glasses, and I've not had this same problem with those."
2,"fascinating subject, but tiresome, irritating style","I'm very, very interested in mental illness, and a fan of first-person tellings of stories like this. But I found Mr. Neugeboren's writing to be incredibly irritating -- sentences with 4,5,6,7 or more commas -- parenthetical statements in the midst of far too many sentences. I found it to be tiresome and irritating. I have no way of knowing whether this is the author's natural writing style, or whether he's aiming for a poetic, disjointed sort of flow. In any event, it was a bummer to have so anticipated this book and have been so disappointed."
5,"Brilliant, moving, helpful to family members","If you're looking for a way to help a mentally ill relative, you must read this compelling book and its (equally compelling) successor, ""Transforming Madness: New Lives for People Living with Mental Illness,"" also by Morrow. No, don't just read them. Buy them; tuck them away in a visible, dust-free spot; pull them out for inspiration when your relationship with your relative falls into a pothole. Big Neugie and Little Neugie will help pull the two of you out of it and go on with your lives together."
1,Exploitation of sibling...,"This book was terrible, it was an expolitation of his brother, and a shameless way to promote his other books. No matter the situation, the author found a way to make a reference to another book he had wrote. It was poorly written, and jumps around quite a bit. Don't waste your time or money on this book, or any book of this author's."
5,Perfect Fit,"This came well packed, and is a perfect replacement for my 1999 Ford Explorer. Fits and looks exactly like the original!"
4,F Troop Review,The best show ever to come on televisionI can`t wait for the next season to be released.
4,The bumbling troop is back,"I remember watching syndicated episodes of this show while a kid. I had remembered it being funny but not much else.I wanted to buy this first season so that I could remember what the excitement was about and I was glad that I did.The show is hilarious with a fun premise. Ken Berry plays the straight-laced Captain who has no idea that Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch are actually running the fort.Warner did a beautiful job in restoring these shows, which are in black and white. There is very very little evidence of any ""pops"" and ""scratches"" that is often prevalent in old black and white film. The sound quality is well-done as well, although mono, it still sounds fine.I recommend purchasing this to relive the fun of the bumbling F-Troop."
4,Funny little western time warp! (back to the 1960s),I have had a blast watching the old F-troop shows. It was one of my favorite TV shows as a kid. And I find they old up pretty well after all these years. Anyone one looking for a little 60's TV nostalgia cant go wrong here!
5,great,"great quality love this show as good as I remembered would recommend this to anyone.love this all time classic, I watched this as a kid and it stuck in my memory as a funny good tv show and my memory was right"
5,F Troop The Complete First season,I found seeing F Troop for the first time for years.It was great to see it all again.I enjoyed it so well it brought great memories back to me. The transfer from the film to dvd was excited !! .It worth seeing over again. I be looking forward to see F Troop the complete second season when it comes out.Highly recommended.
5,"F Troop, watch and laugh","F Troop has been a favorite for a long time. I was delighted to find it available on DVD. It is timeless humor, enjoyable over and over.The cast was great, Hard to believe the female lead, Melody Anderson, was only 16 at the series start! One thing nice about the older TV series is that they don't cover up the dialog with dumb songs.F Troop - The Complete First Two Seasons 1&2"
3,F Troop,Hmmmm.... not exactly what I expected! The reveiws were that it was clean and never anything that parents would worry about....well...there are alot of insinuating conversation and some sensual scenes. LOVE Forest Tucker!!! He is hilarious but there are parts that I am not sure I want my kids to watch. I got it for a Christmas gift and doubt I will give it to our son. Why can't Hollywood just LEAVE OUT some things that are totally NON relevant to the movie????GREAT seller tho! Timely shipper!
3,No F for F-Troop,This is a one note comedy series from the sixties. Lots of slaptick bits and jokes that are great in smalldoses. If you watch several episodes at one time you will be struck with the repetition of some of the gags. I liked the casting and thought they could do so much more with more material. The cannon gag is in just about every show. Tag lines are used over and over again. My verdict is OK in small doses. Too bad a talented cast was wasted.
5,laughs galore,F Troop made me laugh until the end and you will laugh too.They couldn't have picked a better cast.F Troopo is a definite must for Your collection.You will not be disapointed.
4,Great for what it is,"This very light comedy series, based largely on slapstick and silly dialogue, has its fans, of course, and we can be grateful that it is here presented in a nearly flawless DVD. But watch out: My copy, at least, has a default set on French subtitles, and you have to go through the process of eliminating subtitles each time to get rid of them. That said, sit back and enjoy. Especially you fans of the Three Stooges."
2,not useful as a wildlife guide,"This book includes more of a random assortment of animals, like viruses and starfish, and not just urban animals. There is no mention of what distinguishes an urban habitat from any other. Many entries aren't specific enough about where you can actually find each animal, or what it eats. The mammals and bird sections are pretty good, almost good enough to buy the book. This should have been a larger book about all animals; it is misleading to label this as an urban wildlife guide."
3,More interesting to adults than babies,"My boys both as infants and toddlers (the oldest is now 2.5) have never given this toy more than passing attention. It certainly has never been a favorite. They never play with it for more than about 30 seconds.To be fair, it is sturdy and has held up well over the last 2 years. It is also a good size for being used as a toy in the car.I just wish it entertained my boys more."
4,I really enjoy my ibook,"this is my second review on this laptop. I have always admired apple, just for their customer service their stuff and their hardware. When I first recieved an ipod mini, I just had to discover what other things this so called company Apple made...It just so happens that I've had my ibook for almost a year now and I really really like it. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because i think it could be much better if it were faster and had more RAM. I'm actually gonna get more installed in about a week, I'll update my review then. But yeah, the ibook is great for anyone who just needs a laptop do do schoolwork on create music, listen to music. My job actually requires that I do much more demanding things with music files, so I might just get a faster powerbook intstead. But if u don't need fast and the furious, I totally reccomend the APPLE IBOOK G4! Its great!"
3,Trouble with Display Screens!,I am a teacher in a high school and we just got ten of the small white plastic IBooks with the G4 processor and three of them had the display screens go to black right out of the box. It is a logic board problem and covered under warranty but what if it happens after the year is up? These logic boards have had to be replaced. I've heard this is a problem and was fixed on newer models but these new ones have the problem so I don't know what to think. I was going to purchase one for my daughter but now I'm having second thoughts.
2,Great computer when it works...,"I love Mac OS X, but I've found my ibooks not worth the hassle and sacrifice I've had to make to keep using them. On 3 ibooks in 2 years, I have had 6 logic board failures (the computer crashes and will not boot, and repair takes weeks), two broken CD drives, and I have had Apple twice break my computer (they offer to re-repair it but it takes weeks usually, since they tend to be out of parts every time I get something repaired). I've called Apple a million times but they refuse to replace the computer or offer any type of refund. As nice as ibooks are when they work, theyre not worth $1000 plus frequent repair and many weeks a year without a computer. I recommend a Dell or something until Apple gets its act together."
4,Amazing!!!! but add more ram,"Pro's:Great screancan hold 1.25 GB of ram.great sizegreat for microsoft office, dreamweaverbattery life is goodCon's:sucky trackpadthere needs to be in other colurscould be a little thiner"
3,"damaged operating system, missing software packages","I ordered iBook G4 1.2GHz from Amazon. Operating system couldn't regognize DSL connection. I called apple computers, they told me to earase and upload os x stystem, which I did. Even after that it couldn't connect to DSL, but worse it wiped out AppleWorks and many other software products.I want to replace my computer. And it's hard to replace computer through Amazon. It will take me about 10-15 more days to do so. It's very inconvinient."
5,I really like my laptop!!,"This laptop is very user friendly, and an enjoyable peice of equipment. The battery life isgreat, as well as memory capability; however the price is too expensive. I got my laptopfor FREE! Just paste this site in your address bar, and have fun with it!(...)"
3,"Great laptop, but soon to be obsolete","The iBook is a great laptop - especially for those who are interested in trying out a mac. However, these laptops lack the minimum graphics card to support all of the features in the next MacOSX release (10.4) which will occur by May at the latest.Which means that Apple is unloading these iBooks to clear their inventory of the substandard graphics card and will soon upgrade this system to a GeForce card that supports pixel shading. Otherwise, MacOSX 10.4 will run slower on your machine because the graphics will be totally loaded under your CPU. With future iBooks, the upgraded graphics card will unload the graphics to the GPU. Huge speed difference. You might want to hold out purchasing an iBook for a few more months.This also could mean a total redesign of the iBook, but that is totally speculative."
1,Disappointed,"Yet another mediocre addition to an already saturated market of casino based games. This game brings nothing new to the table. The graphics are very redundant and do very little if nothing to take advantage of the 2D/3D hardware which is present in the majority of gamer's machines at present. Bottom line, too little too late."
1,Why?????,This is possibly the cheesiest card game i've ever seen. Trust me and stick to the freecell and solitaire that comes with windows. Don't waste your money on this.
3,How was barbie born?,Little girls love dolls such as Barbie and American Girl but do they know they got started. This book has 5 short biographies of doll makers and how they came up with the ideas for their dolls. Also included in the book is a section on the future of dolls and where the author feels the industry is headed today.
2,Outmoded and Often Inaccurate,"Of all the Herbert Norris books I have read, this one suffers the most from his preconceptions and inaccuracies. It is also the one that has suffered most from the passage of time, as subsequent archaeological research has revealed errors in what was considered, in Norris's day, to be ""factual"" information about costume. The best thing about his book, in my opinion, is the meticulous line drawings of brooches and other items of period jewelry, but again, more recently published works contain excellent, full-color photographs of the same or similar specimens. Read this book if you enjoy Norris's style, but do not accept anything in it blindly as much of it is plain wrong."
4,Good reference for Dark Ages costumes,"Too many costume books seem to skip from Byzantium straight to the Renaissance. This book is a reasonably good source for the Dark Ages -- not just Celts and Normans, either; it has info on Goths, Saxons (continental and British), Vandals, and a whole bunch of tribes that usually get either forgotten or lumped together as ""barbarians."" Another reviewer has noted that it's somewhat outdated, but it's a good idea book for an experienced costumer, especially for accessories (boots, jewelry & the like.)"
5,I played the role of Dawn Divito in the stage version,"I played Dawn Divito in the stage version and I thougth the character was amazing. It gave a nice character development, from the shy girl to the outrageous and confident student at the end. The audience howled at the plays, all six of them. Particular favorites were The Universal Language, Var. on the Death of Trotsky and A Philadelphia. Buy this play! It's outrageous."
4,A fun read,"Ives is original and funny, with an acute sense of satire and irony. I chose the book as a text for an EFL course, for which it is not really suited, but I have greatly enjoyed reading the plays all the same. Recommended."
5,It's All In The Timing,"This is one of the funniest plays I've ever had the experience of getting to know. I just finished a run of it at my high school last week (I was Mrs. Trotsky), and I don't think I've ever laughed so hard! I highly, HIGHLY reccommend this play to anyone and everyone."
4,Taking the English Language to an Art Form,"In these days of cookie-cutter plays, where an intellectual evening is watching David Copperfield making his career disappear, it is refreshing to read anything that challenges one to think. All In The Timing succeeds, with Ives mastery of the English language and timing being the key to the cleverness of the play. These series of plays are not slap-stick, nor are they Checkov, but an intellectual medium for one who has apparently a bit ahead of his time. While some will find the read of some of the plays difficult (The Universal Language and Phillip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread). These plays, in particular, are for enjoying on stage, rather than read. But for the most part, this collection is an enjoyable evening of intellectual theater."
5,he's got rhythm!,"This excellent collection of one act plays shows Ives' great sense of rhythm, randomly interesting observations about life, and excellent sensitivity towards relationships. I highly recommend it, particularly for the plays English Made Simple and Ancient History."
3,All in the Time -,"I.e., short.David Ives truly is a genius of the postmodern one-act theatre (a form which suffers immensely from neglect and hasty execution), with his *dings* and his voiceovers, and his catchy repartee with the occasional pun.However, directors should bear in mind that his plays, while extremely funny and original, do tend to lend themselves to possibly static blocking. Also, he's dull when he writes full-length - no timing there at all. He does employ ""potty""-humour/language on occasion, which works perhaps a third of the time, but otherwise is merely banal.However, those searching for one-act plays would do well to give David Ives a gander, as well as those who enjoy a little bit of post-modern humour."
5,The New Shakespeare,"All in the Timing is a wonderful collection of some of the funniest plays I've ever read, heard, or performed. I highly recommend this book if you like to laugh."
2,Looking at the script from a director's point of view,"I bought this script because it is on my community theatre's schedule to perform in March. I was very surprised with how I little I liked the script in its entirety. I am familiar with Sure Thing because I worked on it in college, and was expecting more of the same...quick witted, funny pieces that would easily make for a night of entertainment. Honestly, due to content and language, I don't see how we can perform many of these plays on our stage. I know that the scholars are going to bash me, but from a director's point of view, I vote to shelf this one. No audience is going to want to sit through all 14 of these plays when most won't make much sense to them. They want to be entertained and walk away with a thought other than confusion at the end of the night. This script is perfect for college theatre, but that doesn't make me like it any more."
2,Well I seem to be alone,"As an actor involved in the production of several of the plays from all in the timing, while I've found that the plays certainly are all memorable, and very clearly written by an INCREDIBLY intelligent person, far too often these plays suffer from being flat out unfunny. No, theyre not unfunny. The jokes just, far too often, come, and simply refrain from BEing funny. It's unfortunate. The Universal Language is a play that is always FUN to do, and one that will never leave peoples brains, but it's not entertaining because of any wit. This is what tends to happen to Ives. He gets going, and write a great play, but the characters don't have much depth, are not particularly interesting to play, and don't manage to actually be comical too frequently, so it's really not worth it to want to participate in the plays. (With the GRAND exception of The Death of Trotsky)"
4,Perfect for my 1998 Ford Contour SE,No problems with this product because I read and followed the directions. Contrary to the previous customer review this was a cinch to install on my 1998 Ford Contour. I am thinking of ordering a second one for the back so that I can have a pseudo rallye look to my car once I get my windows tinted.
2,Racist through and through,"Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the ""dark people"" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled."
2,700+ pages of buncombe,i accidently entered the same review twice. I guess there's is no delete button.
2,uhh..?,"This book is so incredibly overrated its sickening. its mainstream tripe for the philistine reader of our age.But I give this 2 stars instead of one, only because I suppose it will be good treadmill exercise for the reader that doesn't read much and wants to make themselves feel literate."
4,Perfect Example Of How A Book Can Be Great But Not Good,"When I first read this book, I didn't like it. It did grow on me and in retrospect I saw it was some of the best satire done in decades. But I think the actual book itself is so heavy and so full of genuinely mercenary and dishonorable people that it makes you want to hold it at arm's length. This is a tough read, and it dwells in themes that by nature are not pleasant. What it DOES achieve is an ultra-realistic (and growing moreso by the year) illustration of how society really works."
4,Surprisingly pulpy,"This is the first Tom Wolfe novel I've read, and I had a preconceived notion of southern literature along the lines of Styron or Faulkner. This novel is more Olivia Goldsmith than Carson McCullers, and I have to admit I loved it. Wolfe's detailed inner dialogues were addicting, and I followed each of the characters with varying degrees of sympathy, admiration or disgust, but never boredom. He describes the world of his story to such an exact amount of detail that I feel like I could now write a novel of New York in the '80's (or at least Tom Wolfe's version of it). I was hoping desperately for a neat and happy ending, and I was both pleasantly surprised and disappointed with the resolution. Quick, satisfying read."
3,"Sorry, There is no Hero.","Wolfe is an amazing author. On a literary level this is one of the best books I've read. The dialogues in the book are marvelous while the writing itself creates some beautifully contrasting and yet similar characters. The book bleeds social and racial overtones that are devastatingly real and yet rarely put onto paper the way Wolfe has. The story is okay, but the lack of a hero left me detached from the whole thing. The book is worth reading however, if only to appreciate the bluntness and humanity in Wolfe's writting."
5,When Wolf knew how to write,This book sums up New York and the criminal justice system. Don't waste your time on A Man in Full. Wolf lost the gift after Bonfire.
1,One star for the General Books LLC version,"My one star review is for the General Books LLC version and relates to the low quality of the publication. Check the publisher of the version you're buying before you place your order.General Books LLC created this book using automated OCR scanning. There are numerous typos and there may be missing pages. There's absolutely no editing done (the publishers website states this clearly). Overall, very poor quality at a higher priced than much better imprints from genuine publishers that actually edit their books. (Incicentally, the version you see when you ""Look Inside"" is from another publishers printing of this book).Unfortunately, General Books LLC is flooding Amazon with these low quality imprints. You've been warned."
2,Poor Quality,"There are a huge number of typos that are very distracting and frustrating. As stated by other reviewers, multiple words in a row are smushed together and there are random symbols floating around the pages. I recommend going to a used books store or something similar to get the book, because this version is not worth the money."
2,Good book bad Digitization,"The digital copy of this book is poor with artifacts on almost every other page, makes it difficult to read at points, definitely not worth the price for the effort the publisher put in."
5,"I know it's cheesy to say this, but I couldn't put it down!","This not only happens to be my favorite Tom Wolfe book, but my favorite book period. The plot is exciting and realistic. Readers will relate with every single character depicted here. And no one matches Wolfe's descriptive capabilities. What the rest of us would need a million words to say, Wolfe manages to express with a few key and very visual phrases. So far, there isn't a book I've enjoyed more."
5,Great Book - Very Enjoyable,Great Book. Very enjoyable. The writing is probably better than the story. There are sentences in this book which I think are probably the finest ever written. An absolute treat.
5,Engaging and Good,"""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" is a good book...one of those books that are enjoyable to read and educate you in some way at the same time. Richly drawn with a well-developed plot line and memorable characters (and caricatures), this is a book that should stand the test of time.What I enjoyed most about this book was how well the scenes, settings and characters were drawn by Wolfe. He has a gift for capturing the essence of a time and place...something he does quite well in ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" for different sides of New York City in the 1980s.This is a great and memorable book."
3,"Die, Yuppie scum!","I have been a Tom Wolfe fan for over two decades but continue to think that his real talent is for the essay and not for long fiction. Like Mailer, he seems to be able to string words together with unnerring skill but has trouble sustaining a tight narrative. Mostly, for me, what kept this book from coming alive was my dislike for the main characters. I just didn't care what happened to them. Rather, nothing could be bad enough. This is pure prejudice on my part, but I can't get past it. I hate these folks - their lifestyle, their values, their friends, their work, their entire social world - and I really don't want to read about them. Certainly not read this many pages. Couldn't he have punctured the hero's little life in half the number of pages and not left the reader so numb?"
2,I didn't put it down...,"...but I easily could have. Bleah. Dull and racist. I am not much of a Tom Wolfe fan at this point, having read and been bored by both ""A Man in Full"" and ""Bonfire."" I admit laughing at and being impressed by the vivid characterizations--the prose and powerful description does keep you going, but the plot definitely does not."
1,Horrible disappointment,"Perhaps I expected too much after hearing so many good things about this book. But I found it one of the most dull works of fiction I've ever read. I admit that Wolfe does has a prescient insight into the 80's greed mentality. But the writing and his use of language is sophomoric at best. This is one ""best-seller"" that clearly plays to a mass audience, but completely will be forgotten with time."
1,Totally defective,The book was defective. chapters repeated themselves or were skipped all together. Evidently there was something wrong with the printing of the book.
3,"Good, Not Great","As I first began reading the book several years ago, I thought it was quite intriguing and well-done. As the book went on however, I realized none of the characters were three-dimensional. The situations in which they were placed could certainly happen, but the complexity of character doesn't equal the plot structure. It was worth reading, but it's not something I'll ever return to."
3,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I found the book enjoyable once I got over Wolfe's promiscuous use of exclamation points. I found the characters to be jerks, but aren't we all."
4,Great read,Tom Wolfe doesn't hold back on punctuation and it made me feel like he was next to me telling me this story. I also listened to a bit of it on audio and it was really good too.The book is about class issues in New York. Masters of the Universe versus ghetto kids. Great read.
5,Great book,"Well written, kept your interest all the way to the end. The story showed how far man would go for his vanity."
5,Entertaining and fascinating,"A friend of mine gave me the book to read over the Christmas break. What a treat. Some parts caused me to laugh out loud. I found the ending to be appropriate because it could very well be the true ending for a ridiculous case such as the one McCoy was in. When you're dealing with the politics of situations, this is sometimes the way things unfortunately end. I did like Judge Kovitsky, he was one of the characters who actually was decent."
3,"Great plot, boring narrative","I loved the lampooning Wolfe did of the 1980s New York society life. It's hard for someone like me to imagine going broke on one million dollars a year, but it appears that in New York high society, it's very possible. The descriptions of the society matrons and trophy wives were hilarious -- that was pretty much my favorite part of the book. Although I enjoyed most of the character depiction, there were parts where the book really dragged. I hate it when I have to force myself to read the whole chapter and not skip pages because I'm afraid of missing something. All in all, a good book, but the endless depictions of New York City life and surroundings were a little much. In the end, I could have skipped not only pages, but whole chapters, because the outcome was nothing out of the ordinary."
2,"Funny, but shallow","I used to live in New York City, so I thought Tom Wolfe was right on target in describing its politics and different social scenes, and satirizing them. However, I couldn't relate to any of the characters; they were far too stereotypical and not enough like real people for my taste. You had your token Irish cops and pols, your token Italian pol/mafiosos, your token Upper West Side Jewish intellectual lawyers, and your token doofus WASP stockbrokers and socialites. I wouldn't be surprised if some people found these depictions insulting. Maybe I'm personalizing this, but it's also almost as if Wolfe is saying that if you don't fit any of these stereotypes, you can never be a true ""hip"" New Yorker. I would have found this book more interesting had the characters been much more complex."
2,Dull,"I'm not sure why this book got so many five star reviews. It's not a terrible book, but I found it to be incrediably predictable and dull. I had pretty much figured out everything that was going to happen within the first hundred pages or so. There wasn't much point in finishing it. I love long books, but this one was pointlessly so. Wolfe goes into a lot of useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot. I found myself skimming many of the pages without feeling I has missed out on anything important. Definately the sort of book you read only if there is nothing else around."
2,Damage understated,I thought that the use was well understated. I received the book and the jacket was practically falling to pieces.
3,Revising Life Values: better late than never,"Tom Wolfe is a master storyteller in this gripping novel. I found it to pace at just the right tempo as well as being hard to put down. Never having experienced Mr. Wolfe before, his material seems a bit dated for today but the reader is still able to appreciate the machination of the legal/political situation in this book. I recommend it highly. Great ending, too."
4,get to the point,"My most serious complaint about this book was the fact that it dragged out so far, and had so much irrelevant stalling. Who really cares about Larry Kramer trying to get ""the girl with the brown lipstick?"" In fact, a good portion of the book concerning Larry Kramer could be omitted, as could many of the ceaseless droning about the parties Sherman went to. They're irrelevant, so leave them out. I wish that the author had spent a little more effort on the ending, which is incredibly disappointing, with no real resolution. What kind of book ends with a paragraph to resolve the last 300 pages? Wolfe should have spent a little less time spinning his wheels, and a little more time making it worth it when you finally get to the end."
5,"""Boomer-Man"": Tom Wolfe's Modern Everyman in Bonfire Hell","If F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby was the Modern-Man of his generation, Tom Wolf's everyman hero in ""Bonfire of the Vanities is our Boomer man,"" the guy who can't quite make ends meet on 998,000 bucks a year. Although Wolfe is best known for his ""new journalism"" stethopscopic view of America in works like ""Electric Acid Cool Aid Test"" and ""The Pump House Gang,"" his first foray into the land of the novel is novel indeed.Bonfire is a hybrid of novel and journalism with a pinch of Woody Allen. Wolfe's ""social X-rays"" scavenge cosmopolitan Manhattan cocktail parties as the vultures of the downtown poverty industry exploit a yuppie faux pas that sends his Boomer hero into a crashing Sartrean abyss.Angular as a spaghetti Western, zanier than Monty Python, and truer than Sinclair Lewis, Mr. Wolf's excursion as a novelist leaves us wondering why he doesn't do more."
4,Succumbing to concupiscience...,"Tom Wolfe understands human nature. He skewers just about every character in this scathing satire, revealing their hidden motives vis a vis their outward actions. Pride seems to be at the root of everyone's shameful conduct in this novel. Tempted to forget about fallen human nature? You'll remember after reading this one; I recognzied my own sordid manipulations and rationalizations in Wolfe's well-crafted characters. The book's not preachy, though, and it's funny; I laughed out loud a number of times."
5,Shades Of Purple,"I think this CD is the best CD I've ever listened to! Especially Mirror Mirror. I love the piano playing! I'm a piano player, so I should know."
1,Mirror Mirror,I need to know the words in this song so I know what it is like before I buy it. The reason I did rated this CD with one star is because I've never heard it before.
5,Fantastic,"If you enjoy Marvel comics, then this book is a must have!!!!! The art work is incredible and the information provided for each Superhero, and Villian is outstanding!!!!! This book is FANTASTIC."
5,Excellent book for any marvel fan,"This book has the best illustrations, not too mention the history behind each Marvel Character. Great book for anyone"
5,Good information and pretty well updated,A lot of superheroes that you have totally forgot about. Plus multiple histories for heroes that have been reborn or changed over time. An A+ for any comic book fan. A real great way to teach your kids about the comics or to have a significant other learn about the charactors of the movies.
3,so many errors!,"Like any Marvel fan I was very excited about getting my hands on this encyclopedia, only to be sorely disappointed by the amount of errors found within it's pages. Error examples include: page 46, Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, an image of Nightcrawler is found under a listing for Black Tom Cassidy. Page 212 , an image of the Shiar imperial guardsman Nightside is shown under the character listing for Nightshade. Page 171 An image of the Asgardian character Lorelei is shown under the character listing for the Savage Land mutate of the same name. These are few example of the many errors throughout the book."
3,Almost there...,"I have a hard time recommending this book. There are plenty of Official Guides to the Marvel Universe out now that have more information, and are likely more accurate. Typos and mislabled pictures are frustrating for someone who knows the history well, and misleading for those that may not. That being said, it has a picture for everyone, and it is a nice book to flip through. If you are a Marvel-phile like myself, it really isn't a bad pickup. If you want to know more about the history of your favorite characters - I'd look other places instead."
4,great but not as good as DC Encyclopedia,"The bottom line is that I love the characters of the Marvel Universe and this book rocks the house. However, I feel that the DC Encyclopedia is superior in every way.My main criticism is the amount of space given to certain characters. The Mad Thinker and Alicia Masters get almost a full page each - while Black Bolt, The Rhino, and Deadpool each get a whopping 1/8th of a page. Kind of a drag!"
2,Only Marvel,"I love the book I have the DC version of the book and I loved it. So when Marvel finally did one I was jumping for joy. Until I got the book and I started to read it. their are so many typos and things wrong with it. Some one was not doing there job when editing the book. And Im not just talking oh a little thing in a character bio or characters missing. I'm talking characters with the names of others and the bios of other characters. Its so bad I thought about sending the bookback.If anyone else out there with the book has the same issue I would love to know,I have a friend with the same problem with the book. But he didn't purchase it from Amazon. Can anyone Tell me what I should do if I want to get a new one. Do I go through Marvel or Amason?"
3,"Good resource book, although not as in-depth as its DC Comics counterpart","I liked the Marvel Encyclopedia and it is very useful. However, DC Comics Encyclopedia is more in depth and talks about home bases and wars, where Marvel's does not."
3,Poorly Edited and Written But There's Nothing Else,"I read every single entry and there's an amazing amount of typos, poorly edited entries and other mistakes. Then again, the comic book industry has never been too keen on being careful with spelling, typos and editing its works in a truly pro way. Then again, there's nothing like this book in the market, thus we are stuck with it. It can be readily improved nonetheless and its still a necessary reference work for anyone interested in the Marvel universe."
4,"The Best Encyclopedia, But...","I'm a big fan of the DC one. So when I saw that DK was putting a Marvel one together, I was looking forward to it. Well, it delivers for the most part. In my opinion, I think they left out too many characters. The DC one was more thorough. But all the impotant characters are in it. The art work is straight out of the comics. Everything is formated very nicely, and it's also better than any of the Marvel encyclopedias before it. For the price you can get it for on Amazon, it's a no-brainer!"
4,MIssing characters,"There are some essencial missing characters in the book, like Peter Parker's clone Ben Riley and Van Helsing - he is just mentioned, and the is a little description about his daughter.But if you want to know about the principle ones, or the ones already movie stars, you will be satisfied, since there are two pages about each of them (i.e. spider-man, hulk, all the x-men, etc...)"
3,If only it had details,"This is an encyclopedia that has a huge list of characters but It felt like a let down compared to the information in the DC encyclopedia. THough I'm more familier with the marvel universe it seemed the DC encyclopedia was more up to date with fewer clerical errors such as mislabeled pictures. Also the entries in the DC encyclopedia were more comprehensive which on comparison of the two I realized was because it had smaller print allowing more information. So really the Marvel Encyclopedia is good for a reader that doesn't have a huge body of knowledge of the MU but readers looking for an encyclopedia as well put together as the DC encyclopedia will be dissapointed which is sad since contributing writers were greats like Tom Defalco, Tom Brevoort, and Peter Sanderson."
2,It's not an encyclopedia,"There isn't enough information on individual characters. (There are a lot of them, and there are pictures, but the pictures take up some much space that there's none left for details.)"
4,Great Book,I bought this book for my son who loves all of the Marvel characters. He reads it every day and is discovering many characters that he did not know previously. He especially likes all of the details and pictures. There is much detail about each character in an easy to search alphabetical order. A very complete book for Marvel lovers and those just discovering them.
4,Great book,"If you are a fan of Marvel comics, this book provides a history of Marvel comics and in-depth of characters."
2,incomplete and inaccurate,"I loved the DC Encyclopedia and expected the Marvel Encyclopedia to be of equal quality, so I bought it without even cracking the spine. I would expect this to be incomplete and it is: after all, there are just too many Marvel characters for one affordable volume. But in too many instances it's also inconsistent (some entries are up to date while others ignore the events of the last year or two), flat out inaccurate or incomplete. The weight that key characters are given is also arbitrary: why does Thanos (a current, key villain in many titles) get 1/6 of a page when Jarella (the Hulk's dead girlfriend from the 1970s) gets half a page. Ridiciulous. They obviously never handed this to a fan to proofread - an easy and obvious move."
4,Overall great book,"My son loves it. anytime he needs to reference a superhero, or challenge his friends to weird questions this book comes in handy."
5,"My comic loving boyfriend, loved this book","I don't know much about comics, but my boyfriend said it was the best gift I had ever given him. We have been dating for 7 years, so it was saying a lot."
4,The Marvel Encyclopedia,For a used book it was in very good share. the book cover was torn on the top and bottom edge but that is to be expected.
1,lame and wrong,"I was so delighted to get this book, but my happiness lasted until I read the first page. They mixed up characters with the picture of one and the entry of another. Example: Belladonna, the picture is Belladonna, Gambit's ex, but the entry is Belladonna, the minor Spiderman villian, there are other examples. Get the Official Handbooks if you want ACCURACY!! Believe me, they're much more reliable and more worth it!"
5,Great Deal,Received merchandise in a timely manner. And for the price we paid (half off cover) the condition of the book was good
4,Beautiful book for any comic fan.,"I love this book! Even as an over sized coffee table accessory! It's gorgeous. Each character is paired with art work, a short bio, and other interesting facts. My boyfriend is a much larger comic nerd than I, so this book was purchased as a gift for him. Sure, someone with enough knowledge of the Marvel universe may find subtitle imperfections in the book, overall it's a great collection. In my opinion, any DK book you find is going to have flaws. Though that is just personal experience."
4,Good,I love this brand. These vitamins are very good. Maintaining good health is important to me and vitamins are a welcome addition in my busy life. I would purchase them again.
5,"High dose, good price, no side effects","I am using this to help keep my acne under control. You have to be careful about the dose, I take it twice a day for a total of 50,000 iu which is a lot. I check my liver function tests on a regular basis. Liver toxicity has been reported on doses as low as 15,000 iu per day. Check with your doctor before you take this product. If your doctor has no idea, find another doctor!"
5,good if taken when directed,"After taking this I've noticed a difference in my skin improving. I've had fewer break outs and has been great for my vision as well. When at the range and focusing on the 300 meter target, it hasn't been as blury. It was always hard to focus in on, up to this point. That was after taking this product for about 3 months.If you aren't taking this as directed by a doctor, then at least look up the facts from a credible source. One thing that I've noticed is that when I take this before going to bed, I have very vivid dreams. Almost to the point of being lucid. That might be a common side effect."
5,"A+ for 25,000 IU Vitamin A",Very good price for the stonger dose of Vitamin A I look for which are not always easy to find without visiting a health store with overpriced products. This is exactly what I want and I am VERY pleased to find it in the dosage and price I was looking for. Expiration date of 10/2015!
3,I didn't see any effect,I didn't see any effect on my skin I have a horrible acne and I saw in the internet to drink some Vitamins A and E for my skin but I dink this thing every day with Vitamin E and C but I didn't see any result. If you guys want your acne to be gone you guys should take a Phantotenic acid (Vitamins B5) because that is the only product in world made my acne gone.
1,Not of good quality,I had to return this hose after using it one time. It developed a hole in it immediately. I had to order a different type of hose.
1,Runaway very fast if your professor is using this!,"I am a grad student in ME specializing in thermal engineering, I've taken undergrad heat transfer and I have strong graduate level math and fluids background. Now that you know some of my credentials, let me say I HATE THIS BOOK! It skips steps and explanations! I am leaving this review to warn anyone who is learning this subject to runaway very fast from this book, you won't learn anything and you'll suffer... There are many better convective heat transfer books out there. The only good thing about this book is the numerous references to other books.On a last note: If you're learing this subject don't believe the reviewers that gave this book five stars, they must be paying off a debt to Bejan or have 30+ years experience in convective heat transfer!"
1,A very difficult text book to learn anything from,"I get the impression that the reader from NH is the only reviewer to have tried to solve some of the problems in this book. There is no possible way to solve these problems. They are on subjects and situations not covered in the book, and even if they were, good luck in understanding Bejan's writing. He skips massive steps, giving only solutions and equations without explanations. Not everyone like reviewer Jeff Booth was born understanding convective heat transfer, so some of us must learn from books. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one. I only hope that Dr. Bejan reads these reviews and that they discourage him from making another failed attempt at text book writing."
5,"Convection heat transfer made ""streamlined""","With this book, Bejan makes convection heat transfer ""streamlined"". Powerful --yet simple and handy-- tools such as constructal theory, scale analysis, intersection of asymptotes method, heatlines, etc., are presented and used in the book to provide readers with a deep understanding of how and why things are happening the way they are. The author's viewpoint on the field is refreshing and original. This is the one book that I would recommend to graduate students interested in convection heat transfer."
3,A pretty good Silhouette Romance,"""Her Secret Children"" is the first book that I read by Judith McWillians and the first Silhouette Romance that I have read in a very long while. In this book American Vicky Sutton learns that her frozen eggs were given to an English couple, the result is twins. Wanting to see her children, Vicky goes to England were she meets James Thayer, thier father.While I liked the plot I have admitt I wished that the story was given more time to develop. I know these are to be fairly quick reads, I would have loved to emotions from the characters."
4,Beautiful Set,It is a beautiful set. The only issue that I had was that the earrings can easily slip off. You just have to be very careful and always use the plastic rings.
4,"A funny story about the forgetful a-cup-half-empty Eeyore, great for a young Winnie-the-Pooh fan!","This funny and sturdy board book is a great introduction to Winnie-the-Pooh and his world of mischief and misunderstanding. In this story, Winnie points out that to Eeyore, the pessimistic donkey, that he lost his tail, and then goes off on the search for it. The story ends happily with the help of Pooh's best friend Christopher Robin and the Owl. This story is very simple and shorter than a lot of other A. A. Milne's stories, but it is accompanied with nice illustrations and is a good introduction to words for a beginning reader. I would recommend it to a parent of a very young child as an inexpensive way to enlarge a budding reader's book collection."
3,Extremely limited,"This looked a lot more interesting than it is. This is an extremely short movie with very little substance to it. It looked all right on a 52"" Samsung but for some reason the picture was very small.Very glad I bought it on a Lightning Deal or I would have been that much more disappointed."
4,Great photography but short film,"Great photography, fascinating film but rather short. Looked fantastic on a 63"" Samsung plasma. Scenes of windsurfers were really awesome."
2,could have had more surfing,"When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing, I was very unhappy with this movie as all the shot of the surfing scene are taken from a helicopter. Its a nice introduction to big wave surfing but nothing compare to riding giants or the billabong odisey. The rock climbing was also so so. The snow board scenes are nice as always but nothing special.Overall this blu ray is good but doesnt show you anything new or that you event seen before."
4,Outstanding photography,"Yes, as someone else mentioned it is a short documentary. However it is well made, the color is more than acceptable, sound is ok. This movie is a tribute to those that decide to challenge the elements while surfing, climbing, skiing having fun while doing it and actually showing respect as well."
2,Poor movie,"The Extreme is smaller than I could expect.I was expecting to see a better overall quality as well, on the scenes, sequences and theme."
4,Sounds Great....Buildability...questionable.,"Great product. Does exactly what it claims. Improvement of sound - without a doubt.Very sturdy product, but it is extremely heavy and difficult to mount on standard, high quality mic/boom stand.We use top of the line AKG stands and booms and the set-up is tenuous at best.We would recommend very large Atlas stands for a more sturdy fit and finish - though these aren't always practical in small, residential studio settings."
2,Buy the Porta Booth Pro Not This,"Not worth the money. You can buy the Porta Booth Pro for around the same price and get much better results. In fact, after putting in a new vocal booth, I'm so impressed with the Porta Booth Pro, I'm keeping it. I am, however, selling the SE Flexion Filter. Waste of money - waste of space. It just looks cool."
1,Waste of money,"Too bad ! I really thought this would help. Very cheaply made IMO. You're better off building one with a frame and some Rockwool. It'll get the job done. I didn't feel a huge difference, and actually didn't like the boxiness of the sound that I was getting. Using an old U87 + UA pre and Comp. Just not worth that kind of money, when you can DIY for less than 50 bucks. It looks cool, but I only care about sound."
2,"Not so Unique, Not so Off The Path","Comparing this book with other books that also cover the same area (like Lonely Planet's Montreal Guide, or the excellentMichelin Green Guide to Quebec), this book is pretty poor onunique information. Almost all of the sites are listed on other tourist sources, and the majority of the 'off path' information consists of individual restaurant and B&B reviews. Almost of all of those are pretty glowing and effusive, and read like advertising copy.The Green Guide has a lot more information all around and is better laid out for a very similar price."
4,Not as great as I had hoped,"Perhaps I expected something more. The essays in this book are often repetitive and non-progressional in subject matter. The softcover version of the book has stills that are more brown and white than black and white... For my money, I am a bigger fan of Hirsch's ""The dark side of the screen"". It is a well thought, well researched look at noir with a cohesive structure. This all is not to say that a majority of the essays in the Reader are not helpful. Of course it is great to read Schrader's piece and some others which deal with nice specifics (how economics affected growth of B genre, lighting, etc.) but at the end of the day I feel too many of the essays are only about defining the genre (or not genre) rather than delving into other things. Also, I probably will buy more books by these authors simply because their care for noir is so true and strong..."
2,Film Noir Reader,"I give this book two stars instead of one because it fills a gap in my film noir book collection, but I have to say it has dated badly. I bought because I loved Alain Silver's book Noir Style, which is a collection of black-and-white stills from film noir classics, with marvelous commentary. But the Film Noir Reader opens with a collection of essays from the 1970s that display everything bad about the 70s, academic, pretentious, pompous, over-anxious to establish a high-brow status for a low-brow art form (at least it was then). In the 2nd and 3rd sections, the ""up-to-date"" essays, we get, for instance, an analysis of the TV show Miami Vice in terms of its film noir elements... Miami Vice???"
2,Dull as gravel book.,"How to take a facinating subject and make it seem deadly dull. I suggest that you movies online, get 'em and watch 'em. If you like faux academia, then this is the text book you will want."
2,Could be a lot better,"It was okay....but with such a great story to work with, this is really not an effort that is worth anywhere near the price they are charging. I'd say skip it and go read the story on Wikipedia."
4,What I expected,"These headphones delivered exactly what I expected from a $41 set, good sound but lacking in the noise-cancellation department. The fabric cord with an extension piece is nice and the design makes it fun to wear. The switch for noise cancelling on/off is well located as it doesn't take up room on a seperate piece or on the cord and the foldable design makes the headphones relatively easy to transport with big pockets. Basicly, everything one can expect from Sony for $41. (Since flying with them I would change this to a 3 review... they just didn't deliver much with the noise cancelling."
3,"bulky, a little uncomfortable","these headphones are alright but id suggest that you save your money and buy something a little better. it uses active noise cancellation, which distorts the sound when theres loud noise and sounds awful if theres a lot of movement (noise cancellation is completely useless on anything less than a smooth road). noise cancellation only works for low frequencies, high pitched sounds are very audible while wearing these, but the noise cancellation does help. its also a little uncomfortable to wear after long periods of time because there is no cushioning for your ears and they are quite heavy."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I took these new headphones on a cross country trip this week. Here's the results:1) There is no noise cancelling to speak of (aircraft engine noise was exactly the same with or without the headphones on).2) Volume level was so low I had to stop watching the DVD because I couldn't hear the sound loudly enough.3) When I was on the ground I switched to my MP-3 player and again the volume was very low (I took off the extension cord connector which helped slightly) and worse yet the sound quality was tinny, almost no base at all.There is nothing to recommend purchasing these headphones. I am frantically looking for my receipt so I can try to return them as quickly as possible."
4,Satisfied with great value,I've had my headphones for a couple of month now and am very satisfied with the sound and quality. The noise canceling is a little weaker then other Sony models I've tried. They are very lightweight and have excellent sound quality. I would recommend them. They are a great value for the price
1,Terrible Headphones,"I only bought these because my cat chewed on my sony fontopia headphones and I was low on cash, and these were on sale for $25. I figured they hold me over for a week or two. A minute into the first song I regretted buying them. First of all, they're ugly as all hell. The only reason i got them is because they said they were noise cancelling and the original price was $70. The noise cancelling consists of a distracting static frequency, and there is no bass whatsoever. These are honestly terrible headphones. I should have gotten $15 sony earbuds, i would have been much happier."
2,Not so good,These headphones do not stay on your ears. Maybe if they were like the other wrap arounds.A good idea but more of a hinderance of keeping them on the ears.
4,90 percents,"its nice, but i just have little disapointed about its volume( its not high enough) Actually it's fine"
1,Unreadable,This book is poorly organized and written. Even the introduction requires the reader to understand material not yet introduced until later chapters. The author repeatedly alludes to subtleties and nuances which obscures clear meaning and hinders the learning process. The book is unreadable and I am returning it for credit.
4,INTERESTING,"I did not find this to be the best of Alice McDermott's works, but I did enjoy it........Rick and Sheryl are high school sweet hearts. Sheryl's father died suddenly, leaving an empty place in her heart. She fills that emptiness with Rick and when she tells her mother that she might be pregnant, her mother immediately sends her from their home in a Long Island suburb to an aunt's family in Ohio....Sheryl did not even have time to let Rick know and he is going crazy trying to find her until finally, one evening he and some pals armed with chains go to Sheryl's house causing a riot......The men of the neighborhood come to the aid of Sheryl's mother and the boys get arrested and everyone gets treated for minor injuries......In the meantime, Sheryl tried to reach Rick by phone, but never was able to talk to him.......Sheryl and Rick go on to live out their lives as their destiny dictates.......This story brings us back to our own teen years and first loves."
4,Not Her Best But Pretty Good,"I really love Alice McDermott's writing and she didn't really disappoint me with 'That Night'. It seemed very real, very authentic. Some of it might have been a bit over the top and the ending was a little smooth but all in all I enjoyed it and recommend it. Read her others, like 'Charming Billy' and especially 'Child Of My Heart'. Better and best respectively."
2,Another verbal window into the past,"Once again,McDermott's verbal mastery takes you to the place of which she writes as clearly as if looking through a window on the scenes she describes so vividly. However, compared to ""Charming Billy"", this piece is disappointing. While very well written descriptively, I found it slow. The opening act caught my attention and I continued to read hoping for more of the same alure...it was not to be found. I actually skipped paragaphs and entire pages and was able to continue as if the skipped parts were of no importance to the story at all. While I would recommend Ms. McDermott's work, I would not recommend this particular book."
4,INTERESTING,"I did not find this to be the best of Alice McDermott's works, but I did enjoy it........Rick and Sheryl are high school sweet hearts. Sheryl's father died suddenly, leaving an mpty place in her heart. She fills that emptiness with Rick and when she tells her mother that she might be pregnant, her mother immediately sends her from their home in a Long Island suburb to and aunt's family in Ohio....Sheryl did not even have time to let Rick know and he is going crazy trying to find her until finally one evening he and some pals armed with chains go to Sheryl's house causing a riot......The men of the neighborhood come to the aid of Sheryl's mother and the boys get arrested and everyone gets treated for minor injuries......In the meantime, Sheryl tried to reach Rick by phone, but never was able to talk to him.......Sheryl and Rick go on to live out their lives as their destiny dictates.......This story brings us back to our own teen years and first loves."
2,Melancholy and Cliche,"Come on, people, get over yourselves. You could find a hundred lovely writers out there, and while McDermott may be one of them, it doesn't mean there's anything particularly interesting about this book. It's filled with such melancholy and self-importance about subject matter that is really cliche at this point. Lovers torn apart, young children in the neighborhood wondering how babies are made, teen pregnancy. It's like something a junior high class might read.McDermott might be trying to pull off something magestic here, but it just comes off as weird. Why is this first person narrator, who isn't even a main character in the story, wandering through these people's lives like a ghost, and killing them all off? That's right, when McDermott runs into a situation that's rather dull, which is often, she gives us a little aside about someone's child dying. It's manipulative and cheap writing."
2,Too sketchy,"I was eager to read the book after watching the film on BBC2 (England). I expected the novel to be more descriptive, imaginative and more three dimensional than the film but found it to be quite sketchy and without fluidity. It jumped from past to present and from scene to scene quite disjointedly and I found it difficult to continue reading for I felt like I'd read the same paragraph over and over. As a result of this the only characters which seemed to convey themselves as three dimensional were that of Rick and Sheryls'. There didn't seem to be any revelation at the end of the story, I guess with having knowledge of that era that it would be quite obvious in the way things ended, with broken teenage love and little thought for the result of that. Quite disappointing overall, though worth watching the film."
1,This Book Robs The Human Spirit Of Any Dimension,"For some reason, people keep recommending this book as a romance. This book mocks romance with all the cold-blooded WASPy detachment of its setting. The only interesting thing about it was that there was a character with the same name as me, which is rare, but that's not a good enough reason for anyone else to read it."
2,retarded son of a cousin twiced removed of JA 2,it is ok for like the first 5 mintues u play it then it just dies and ur just killing ppl with no towns to hold or mines to increase your income and apperantly have 99 marksmenship seems to be worst then a person with 50
4,Ancient History Atlas.,This is a great little book. Unfortunately it covers the peroid just prior to the peroid that I was concerned with. It is concise and clear and would be of value to any one studing that peroid of time. Sue Coon
1,Not Reader Friendly,"This book is hard on the eyes.I read part of it and gave up. All the graphs are printed in blue and uses different types of shading to show different regions. The font size is about 8 or 10. The size of the book is ackward more like what is suited towards an advertising pamphlet. Quite clearly, Penguin is being super cheap about printing this book. It was published in the last few years so I'm totally confused what's the issue here. I mean come on. I can print full color pages on my laser printer for about 3 cents a page. Why can't a big fancy publisher like Penguin do a decent job printing a book?Buy a different book, your eyes will thank you!"
3,just OK,"I was expecting more - something to wake me up while driving, cheer me up on a gloomy day, or something refreshing. Instead, I found that I didn't particularly like the music, which seemed dated, and it didn't have the desired effect....I may have been put off by the style of the music, however. In its defense, it is sort of upbeat."
1,Disappointed,"I didn't find the music relaxing or energizing. I was too distracted by the fact that it reminded me of bad early 80s music. But on the plus side, it made me want to put on a shiny leotard and leg warmers."
3,Not much to it,"This is a small toy and does not require any batteries, which was the selling point for me. I bought it for my 1 year old niece. I just hope she gets to play with it along with her many many other toys.....:/"
2,It was Great... for five minutes.,"I'm giving this two stars because the problem may be a one-off. My son received this as a Christmas gift yesterday. I unpackaged it this morning and wound it up and it worked great. My kid loved it, the melody was nice and all was grand. Until I tried to wind it up again. I heard a loud snapping sound and the winding wheel started spinning free. I opened up the case to see if the problem is repairable, but it's not. The gear that attaches the winding wheel to the music box is made from a cheap, flimsy plastic, and all the teeth had snapped off. I have an email in to the toy company to see if they can help me get a replacement part, and if they do I will update my rating to make it more favorable."
5,"Excellent Book. Useless however, for convincing ""educated"" athiests.","Being a former athiest, I appreciate all of the arguments that can be made against Lewis' apologetics. That being said, I feel that it is impossible to convince someone through reason and logic, who has already convinced themselves otherwise through reason and logic. Either God gave you the convictions/morals you have, or mankind developed them to cope with survival on Earth. It really remains the Holy Spirit's responsibility to convict men of the truth. On that note, if you are already convicted, and take comfort knowing that beleif is still reasonable, involving your brain as well as your heart, this book speaks volumes. For those who've read it and object to his stance on evolution, or universalism, remember that He is still a man, and subject to error. I personally don't have a problem with those two beliefs. To sum it up, this book is perfect for someone who just responded to an altar call."
1,BAD QUALITY,"Great book (content wise) - really bad quality, the binding broke and pages started falling out within less than 2 months."
4,Extended Analogy fallacy,"This book is an excellent read. Lewis manages to speak intelligently on a subject which is mostly surrounded by bluster and dogma. His logic is ultimately incorrect, however, and he makes numerous uses of the Extended Analogy fallacy. Still, it was an enjoyable read and it got me thinking. Though I do not agree with Lewis's conclusions, I enjoyed the road he takes to get there."
3,C.S. Lewis book,The seller said this book was new and when I got the book it was obviously used with many creases in the pages and even on the cover. It was a great book though. Lovely read. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to read it.
5,Recommend the writer to everyone,Book was in okay shape but the material inside is a must foranyone seeking truth.
5,Mere Christianity is a Winner!,"This was the first book by C.S. Lewis that I read. I have now read about 10 of this great author's works. In my opinion it is a must read for everyone; Christian or non-believer, it says it like it is. At times when I am having trouble explaining things to my friends that are consumed by the secular world, I purchase this book for them as a gift. If they are still confused about a supreme being after such a read then I would question their comprehension or desire to learn the truth. Once you begin to read this book it is very difficult to put it down; it is a catalyst for intellectual thought and enlightenment.Dr. Long"
4,Enjoying C.S.Lewis,"I find his books to be great insights into being a Christian. Had read several of the books in previous years wanted to share his writing with friends. ""The Great Divorce"" is such a clear picture of hell. I highly recommend the set."
5,Review of the Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics,"I had read two of C.S. Lewis' works- Mere Christianity and the Chronicles of Narnia-and wanted to read more of his books.This book is great in that it contains some of classics like the Screwtape Letters, Miracles, etc. in one edition.I have not completed the entire work yet, but have enjoyed what I have read so far. C.S. Lewis is one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century and you will see why when you read some of his literary masterpieces contained in this edition. I recommend it highly."
5,You can never go wrong with C.S. Lewis- The perfect gift idea!,"These books are wonderful and a ""must have"" for any C.S. Lewis fan. They are light weight and easy to handle. The print is very small so I wouldn't recommend this particular set for anyone with vision problems. The type is double spaced though, making it easier to read. If you are looking for a gift for a devoted Christian, this set of books would be a safe bet."
1,Boooo Harper Collins!,"For some reason Harper Collins specifically arranges for Canadians who buy ebooks via the Amazon.com website to get higher pricing and exclude them from sale pricing. I can't imagine why, it takes no more to deliver to us wirelessly and I'd have to assume our converted US funds are just as good."
5,An excellent defense of the Christian Faith,C.S. Lewis (my favorite non-fiction author) has written an excellent defense of the Christian faith. This book is the foundation for modern apologetics. A must read for Christians in a modern intellectual society.
1,I Stopped Reading It,"A friend recommended this book as something that would encourage ""logical"" belief in God. I doubt he read it himself, first.Most of the claims he makes are based on assumptions, which makes for very frustrating reading."
1,Murky Reasoning,"Although technically well written, Lewis' argument stumbles from one questionable assumption to the next. The result is a sad parody of logical thought.For a Christian this book is a gift, it reinforces faith that already exists. For those on the edge of faith, Lewis might be the push they are searching for. Other than that, it is unlikely to have any lasting effect on the reader."
5,"Solid, consistent and enjoyable","Originally a series of radio broadcasts that were transcribed into book form with the author's help, C. S. Lewis' witty and systematically logical defense of Christianity still endures as a favorite today. Although intellectual works of this caliber can seem intimidating, his conversational style of communication makes the book approachable and thoroughly enjoyable. He not only addresses the common sense of Christianity, but also thoughtfully doesn't neglect the practical need, the heartfelt void, that Christ alone can fill. All in all, this book is an all-around, solid work that consistently covers all the bases of thought and makes for a great read."
2,Not good not bad,"We read this book for my bible study group. There were mixed views on it...I myself wasn't a huge fan of the book for a few reasons. This book is based on radio broadcasts by Lewis a long time ago, and as a result a lot of the things Lewis discusses don't account for recent developments and modern day things that affect Christianity. Also, I felt like Lewis was a bit closed minded in his scenarios and theories about Christianity. However, I have heard people say that they converted to Christians after reading this book so maybe there is something I am missing. It isn't the best book for a discussion, its probably better for reading for yourself. The book does discuss interesting topics and like Christianity and Marriage, Faith, Hope, etc. Overall, although I didn't like it too much, i don't regret reading it either, so maybe that says something for the book."
5,Every Christian should read Lewis,"I love C.S. Lewis. He has never dissapointed me. But Lewis absolutly out did himself in Mere Christianity. I wish every nonbeliever would read this book to learn a bout the basic teaching and theologies of Christianity, and that every Christian would read this book to find out how much they really have in common with each other. Beautifully written. A true classic for all time."
1,Paperback is cheaper?,"The kindle edition is more expensive than the amazon.com-sold paperback! This a wonderful text, but I can't justify getting it in the kindle format if it's even cheaper in the more-worthwhile paperback format. Go buy the actual, physical text!"
1,Mere Delusion,"Some friends who found out that I was an atheist suggested this book. Being so highly praised in the Christian community, I decided to give it a try. It was soon apparent that the author had no deep understanding of religion, science, or logic. Mr. Lewis gives little or no justification for his beliefs. I did come away with greater understanding of how emotions can cloud one's better judgement. The only book I've read worse than this is I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH TO BE AN ATHEIST."
2,First and Last Book I'll Read by C. S. Lewis,"I read this book on the recommendation of a Christian friend. I also read it because I've read and heard that C. S. Lewis is a great author. One more reason is that I was struggling with the concept of God. I am a Catholic.I guess I'm trying to say that I read it with an open mind, expecting to find insights and maybe some genuine knowledge.All I can say is my actual experience: This is the worst book I've ever read all the way through. (Which is, in a sense, faint praise. A lot of books have gone straight to the trash halfway through.)"
5,C.S. Lewis is a master communicator,"If you love to think, you will love this book.If you don't love to think, you will after reading this book!So many great contemporary thinkers of modern day have been influenced by C.S. Lewis.No matter what flavor of apologetic thinker you can think of, if you listen or read long enough to them you will find Lewis' defense used by everyone as a base for their arguments. Don't be left in the dark, think for yourself, read this book!"
5,Thought provoking writing,"This was the first C.S Lewis piece I had ever read, and it was compelling. He put a spin on the whole realm of Christianity unlike anything I've read before. Some of the chapters were a bit difficult to absorb, so I reread them and it started to make more sense. Lewis doesn't claim to know all the answers about being a Christian, but he certainly makes a good case for why we should all give Christianity a chance."
5,Beautiful as only simplicity can be,"This book is truly astonishing. It explains the concepts that lie at the heart of Christianity with amazing simplicity and clarity.I have found it to be a true treasure, a book I am certain I will return to many times over.C.S. Lewis is masterful in his poignant honesty and colourful metaphors."
5,Outstanding,"Known as one of the greatest Christian writers of the 20th century, of all time for that matter, Lewis' title would perhaps be better titled Why Christianity? His arguements are strong yet simple with many real world examples to illustrate his points. The text is perfect for the new Christian, the layman, the clergy, and, in my case, the teacher/Seminary student working on a second masters.Rev. Thom Reed M.Th."
1,Primitive concepts outdated by todays understanding,"I have no doubt that C.S. Lewis was a fine man and he certainly set out to achieve a noble goal here. Making the spiritual more understandable through the application of logic has an undeniable appeal. Unfortunately, his assumptions about some of the basic concepts of human nature look positively naive by modern standards. He comes off sounding like, as one of my psych professors was fond of saying, a ""park-bench philosopher"". Behavioral science just had not developed to the point it has today, so he had no way of knowing that his basic assumptions about some things he viewed as givens were, in fact, not given at all. In the end, trying to make the subject of religion something that one can put to the test of ""logic"" is an exercise in futility. That's why it's called faith."
2,Bad philosophy.,"This book does little to persuade anyone, much less a firm atheist, to become a Christian. I have read good Christian apologetic books (The Case for Christ, for example) and in comparison this book fails miserably. Lewis uses silly arguments (Moral Law? Please) to try and convince his audience, but it merely solidifies the atheist's viewpoint that ninety percent of Christian arguments are far-fetched and preposterous. Most of the book is about how a Christian should live, but what good is talking about a Christian life if he can't convince the reader that Christianity is true?"
2,Every atheist should read this book...,not because it contains any profound insight but because somebody's going to eventually quote it and you might as well have read it. Just grit your teeth and bear with it.
1,Merely the same things rehashed,"I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded, good person. This book has nothing new in it. It is worthless. It is just another example of a poor deluded SOB trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering.This book is prosylazation. Prosylatizers, I have found, try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith, and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith. The truly faithful person does not prosylatize, for if one is secure in one's faith, why preach? If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE, I would."
1,C.S. Lewis keeps on playing those mind games forever...,Buy this book if you want to believe; skip it if you seek truth.
5,The Complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics,"Arrived early. Very prompt service. Just as described, excellent condition. It is a gift and the person who received it loved it."
5,Basic Premises of common Christian doctrine,"Written in 1943 at the tail end of WWII, Mere Christianity was originally produced as a radio broadcast where the author presented the basic premises of common Christian doctrine. It became so popular Lewis produced a written form of his broadcast which became this book."
1,disappointing and childish,"I bought this book hoping to find an intelligent defense of faith, given that the author is such a well respected fiction writer. Unfortunately, what I found were the kinds of arguments that I used while in grade school and discarded soon thereafter. If you've thought critically about anything at any point in your life, you're not going to get anything out of this book."
2,Mere Christianity,Book was supposed to be gently used. Came in with pieces tornof the front and back covers.
5,Don't Wait!,"I waited a long time before I got around to reading C.S. Lewis and regret my procrastination. He is not only a prolific writer but he comes across as a humble person. How refreshing to find one who is so brilliant. He is not only close to God but he is able to articulate his views allowing many of us to make progress on our personal journeys. He may have some philosophical flaws but ""Mere Christianity"" is a great starting point for those with no religion. I found his short chapters to be easy and pleasant readings while fortifying my faith. I was able to merge many of his thoughts into my own positions. This is not a take it or leave it offering. I have to strongly recommend this book to all at the risk of drawing people into a Christian sect other than my own. Borrow it or buy it and then read it. It should change you as it has changed so many others."
2,Mere Dogma!,"This is not a work for the those uninitiated into Christian dogma. Within about 50 pages, Lewis establishes the existence of the Christian God from the premise that the human being enters this world with a priori knowledge of right and wrong. Wow! The argument is weak, and proceeds through a sort of process of elimination of alternative explanations rather than through a demonstration of the necessity of the Christian God. People had told me that CS Lewis was an intelligent Christian apologist. However, it seem to me that this book is not meant to bring anyone into the Christian fold, but simply to keep them in. I suggest taking a look at Kreeft's book, ""Christianity for Modern Pagans"", a commentary on Pascal's Pensees. Or read Pascal's pensees directly."
3,Fascinating,"This is a fascinating book by a fascinating man.If you read it carefully, with an eye to what it says and more importantly what it DOESN'T say, you will come to a very startling conclusion: Lewis was not a Christian! Lewis did not believe in the central Christian concept of salvation: ""Justification by faith"" and the entire book is an attempt to fashion a soteriology which avoids any notion of ""propitiated wrath"" or ""deflected retribution.""Lewis did not believe the Bible when it described God as having it within his nature to see fit to infinitely penalize one of his creatures. And as the late theologian Dr. Martyn Lloyd Jones said ""Lewis's theology was defective because he was an opponent of the penal concept of the atonement."" Lewis spends his whole book subtly making this point without ever using the jargon, but most Christian readers will entirely miss it."
2,Well written; poorly thought out.,This book is a fine example of how beautiful prose can mask otherwise muddled thinking. Those who are desperate for some validation of their religious beliefs will undoubtedly praise this diminutive tome. Those with sharper wit will easily see past the eloquent facade and discover why this emporer has no clothes.
4,Lewis writes with aplomb; deserves better editors,"There is very little to be written about Lewis' brilliance that has not already been said. He is truly a consumate writer - brilliant, understandable, witty, and humane. Even if you disagree with him, which he makes difficult to do, it is impossible to not respect his intelligence. Each of his works in this handsome volume make that very clear, and all are worth reading.My only quibble with this edition (and hence my 4 star rating of otherwise 5 star material) is the appearance of several small mistakes that should have been corrected by editors. A line of text is missing in ""Mere Christianity;"" there are a few other small mistypings or misspellings elsewhere as well that are not present in non-collected individual publications of Lewis' work.That said, the overall presentation is handsome, if large, and even with the failings of its editors, this is surely a volume that deserves to be owned and read."
5,"What we, as Christians, believe (in a nutshell).",Read it for the second or third time and it is always amazingly new. I plan to go to a seminar this summer at the Kilns (Jack's home near Oxford) so I wanted to get back up to speed. Also recommend George Sayers' bio of Lewis.
4,MERE Christianity,"If you have read Breakfast With Bonhoffer, and liked what you read, then I think you will like this book. It goes into detail about Christianity and how to understand the real meaning of the whole concept between the two books."
5,Attractive Edition of a Classic,I am grate for this beautiful edition of this classic. I gave new copies to my children. Knowing that the wonderful text will be well preserved and presented for a life-time of enjoyment and inspiration is a real value.
3,got the book/haven't read it,the seller got the book to me promptly - i have not had time to read it yet - it's in the to be read pile...it appears to be in good condition.
2,Book,"The book took a while to get here, and when it did, it was in rough shape for supposedly being brand new. I also discovered I could have bought it for $5 cheaper from another online retailer. Not too impressed with this purchase."
1,Long may Lewis burn in Hell,"There is no way I can rate this trite negatively enough.I was forced to read this book. Even if I hadn't been, had I seen it in a book store, just that would have been enough to eliminate previous like of the Narnia series. I once thought of them as fiction, now I know they are Christian allegory.Anyone who believes this already believed anyway, because Lewis hops to conclusions without any links to his premises. Besides which, he begs the question."
1,highfalutin drivel,"I was looking forward to diving into this collection after reading so many positive reviews. Sunday Times writes: ""He is admirably equipped to write spiritual biography for the plain man, for his outstanding gift is clarity"".My answer to that review and this book is this: Unless you are a scholar you soon will find yourself drowning in a morass of words you most likely have never heard before or never use in everyday life. The problem with highly intelligent people, like C.S Lewis, is this: they do not know how to communicate their ideas in plain language so that ""plain"" people can understand what they're saying. I call that ignorance.These books are mostly filled with highfalutin, pompous, non-sensical drivel.Unless you are highly intelligent don't waste your money."
1,didn't recieve that product/ credit card was billed,i never received that book even though my cc was charged. it might have been sent in august but i wonder if they are still printing the book for me?? and walking it to maryland.i do not recommedn this source and had i known this would happen i never would have used amazon.com
1,Boring,"I'm sorry but Mr.Lewis' writing struck me as pedantic and boring. I was initially interested in his works because of my readings in grief literature. I couldn't get into any of his stories. They seemed dry to me. I like the idea behind his ""Screwtape Letters"" but it didnt hold my attention. I am glad he is well read but personally I am just not into his books."
1,not very good..,i could only read half an hour of this critically aclaimed outline. its too wordy/complicated for even the very seasoned christian.
5,Merely . . . Phenomenal,"If you are honestly searching for answers, then you have found the ultimate book. This book isn't for the feint at heart, it's not for bubble-gum churchgoers, and it's not for people who have no desire to objectively search for the Lord. I was totally blown away by Lewis's intellectual examination of Christianity. I had never seen anything even remotely close to what Lewis has done. Lewis's arguments are so unique that you will be left wondering, ""How come nobody ever has addressed these issues in this way before?"" It's almost like the Lord gave Lewis a unique gift to appeal to the intellectuals who are on the fence. If you are on the fence, then Lewis will push you onto the right track (if you are willing)."
5,C.S. Lewis - Mere Christianity,"Especially read the chapter on Forgiveness, chapter 7. The whole book is really, really good. I love this author."
5,Great Apologetics!,"I forget how much I enjoy reading Lewis when I haven't read anything by him in a while. I hadn't read this book before but decided to give it a try after reading a friend's review last year, and I'm so glad that I did! Lewis takes so many of the truths of Christianity and explains them in practical ways. His illustrations and examples are wonderful, really helping his readers to understand what he is talking about. While this book is geared more toward non-Christians, there is a lot that Christians can get from reading this book. In case you can't tell, I really enjoyed this book!"
5,"a ""must have"" for thinking people and slackers alike","i read mere christianity and screwtape years ago and was delighted to see them in one volume with other 'signature classics' by ol' clive staples lewis. if you want to go to narnia on the pop culture train, pass on this. if you want contemporary thought by a man long dead, but his words still live and indict the modern mind to stretch beyond complacency, get this volume NOW!"
3,Mere Christianity,Mere Christianity was difficult to follow and I kind of felt lost in the reading. It was ordered for a class at church. Would rather listen to the teacher explain what's going on.
5,Titles can be misleading - This book serves a great purpose.,"By ""mere"" Christianity, Lewis means that he is writing about the fundamental issues that all Christ-based religions can agree upon. It is written in a conversational tone, with few references to particular bible verses. An outstanding work. This was written 50 years ago but is timeless and accurate today."
5,Christian insights,"I decided to reread ""Mere Christianity"" to see if I could rekindle insights into what is God, what has He done and what should we be doing.I had underlined several sentences and paragraphs from my previous reading of this book. I found that these underlined passages were still applicable. I recorded several new thoughts to aid my understanding of God.Lewis takes on the tough issues facing Christians. For example, we know what morality is but do not practice it completely. When we understand how much more we have to do to be a better person, we are progressing in the right direction.I was particularly interested in two thoughts from Lewis' book.1. Try to become a better person by taking one step at a time. Ask for God's help. This is really good advice. It works!!2. Religious leaders who politicize God's word are not working for God. Religion and political party platforms should remain separate and apart."
4,Mere Christianity,I have listened or read several of C.S Lewis books. This one is my favorite so far.
3,I was disappointed with this.,My reaction to reading Mere Christianity was more disappointed because it did not contain that much new material. This book has been so influential for such a long time. I was very familiar with much of the book. So reading this book lacked the joy of discovery that reading many of his other books provided.
3,What the heck Amazon.com?,So I bought this book from Amazon.com seller and don't be fooled the book does not have the same cover as the picture plus the book looks dirty! It has black smudges all over the front and back cover of both of the books I bought from Amazon.com. LAMO. When I buy a product brand new I expect it to look new. I'm a little dissapointed but I'm still keeping them to read.
5,"""One of the best books on Christanity I have ever read!""","Lewis's descriptions and illustrations of the basics of the Christian life are very practical for the one investigating the tenents of Christianity. I have read and re-read ""Mere Chistianity"" several times and each time gaining new insight. Next to the Holy Bible it holds a place of regular usage."
4,great book...ignore the miniscule differences,"lewis had a definite gift for tackling a subject, almost scientifically, step by step. i was considering Budhism as a possible alignment to Christianity when i read this book. thank God, He used it as a goad in my life. that was two years ago. i just finished reading it again, and i retain my opinion. read it with an open mind, though, and overlook the insignificant dogma that contradicts with statments in the Bible that you interpret differently. there aren't more than a handful, but they deal with some issues like purgatory and alchohol use. i really enjoy this book and think that it's a significant addition to any philosopher or apologist's library."
5,The definitive essay on why Christianity is the one choice to make,"C.S.Lewis has the ability to teach us why Christianity makes sense and why God Himself, makes sense. In words we can all understand he lays out the various reasons to accept Christianity and why it is right and intelligent to do so.As a previous Athiest, his commentary on why we should believe as he does is even more umnderstandable as he takes it from concept to certainty. Very well written by a very smart guy. Written during WWII in England it is also a commentary on the war, in some parts, in relation to good and evil.Another book that should be read by all believers and non-believers alike is ""I don""t have enough faith to be an Athiest"" written by Norman Geisler and Frank Turek. For the believer it is all you need to make sound arguments for why you believe and for the non-believer I challenge you to continue in non-belief after you read the definitive evidence in these pages."
5,Mere Christianity,"This is a step-by-step path to reinforcing the faith journey. I found the reasoning Mr. Lewis used to be understandable and irrefutable and I intend to use it, where possible, to dispel disbelief."
5,C.S. Lewis Signature Classics,amazing collection of writings that allow its readers to know how Lewis came to Christ....a motivational and factual read to help others understand
4,A Book of Life,This is a compilation of knowledge that can be used in a life plan. C. S. Lewis lived through the struggles of life and was then able to put the learning that ensued to paper in these great books. It is great to have them all in one book that will be handed down to children.
5,C.S. Lewis,I bought this book to pass onto my sister. I bought the complete C.S. Lewis Signature Classics because I want to read more of his stories. Everyone can learn about life and religion through C.S. Lewis. Excellent!
5,Excellent Book,It tremendously helped me renew my Christian conviction. He explains what Christian is better than anybody I know of. I recommend this book to anybody who is interested in Christian life without any reservation.
5,Absolutely breathtaking,"Any doubts about Christianity, or just want to learn exactly what it is all about?This is the book."
4,absorbing more and more,enjoying c.s. lewis is a recent pasttime. i find these writings to be enlightening and full of life.
2,Dumbfounding gaps in logic,"I am a believer who loves the Lewis of the Narnia books, but his more argumentative books, including this one, Mere Christianity, are often rather lacking in basic coherence. The gaps in logic are often dumbfounding.My favorite example is Lewis's argument that you cannot accept Jesus as a wise man unless you accept that he is God, because anyone who claims to be God, and isn't God, is barking mad. Putting aside the issue of whether ""the hisorical Jesus"" actually made such a claim, alas, anyone who has ever taken a even a cursory look at the great writers and sages throughout history knows that one minute they can be the fount of wisdom and the next can be absolutely off their rocker. Dostoevsky springs most immediately to mind.And thats not the worst gap in logic in the book.So, those looking for a reasoned defense of Christianity are strongly advised to go straight to G.K. Chesterton's The Everlasting Man and skip this one."
4,"Rough paper, but holds up well","Amended review: I originally rated this at 1 star because of the quality of the materials and binding. My initial reaction when I took it out of the box was ""Yuck. This feels and looks awful."" I have changed the rating on this to 4 stars based on the fact that, although I feel the overall look and feel of this edition is rough (The publisher's attempt to mimic a high-quality hardcover edition? If so, they needn't have bothered.), it has held up well over several months of almost daily reading and studying. The cover is still in good shape and the pages firmly intact, so it has proven to be good-quality binding. I prefer smoother pages, but pages that stay in the book are even more important! I still think the overall look is a little off-putting, but it hasn't impacted the book's utility or my study of its content. Thanks to those who commented and impelled me to take another look at my review and initial reaction."
1,It was lucky to get the one star.,"CS Lewis managed in the Chronicles of Narnia to prove his mastery of the clumsy religious allegory. And, with Mere Christianity, he tries to approach the thorny topic of God's existence and the divinity of Jesus using ""logic"" and ""reason."" It's as subtle a piece of elegant design and craftsmanship as any tractor factory in Rostok.Facile arguments are bolted together using bold assumptions and the Krazee-Glue of faith. It's amazing that anyone could send such a clunky contraption to plough furrows in logic and reason and sow the seeds of unconditional belief. I read that book and I think think the only thing he got right was the title, which is bang-on."
2,it insults your intellegence,"A friend lent me this book while I was reading Bible for my class at UC Berkeley. I told him that I did not understand Christianity so he thought this book may help me. However, this book really makes me feel that Christianity is not an intellegent religion. It insults my intellegence by presenting arguments as a matter of fact. Although the book itself is not philisophical, it tries to convince readers that conservative Christian belief is the only possible explanation of the world. To achieve this goal, it showcases other philosophies and beliefs in a simplified and biased way and mocks them as nonsense while his whole viewpoint just sound stupid. The only value I see from this book is that it shows you what conservative Christians are thinking. You can get a sense of where they are coming from. However, if you are interested in Christianity with some depth, you should check out books like St Augustine's Confessions."
1,Disappointing,"Though Lewis is often described as one of Christianity's best thinkers and writers, this book (actually three books combined) does not support any such description. While easy to read, this book contains nothing but overly simple reasoning, faulty logic, double-speak, and unsupported--and unsupportable--conclusions. This is a book to avoid unless you want a lesson in how to write an easy to read, but intellectually dishonest, book on religion."
5,A Must Read,"This is truly a life changing book. What an incredible mind C S Lewis had. It has been an honor to have the opportunity to read this collection. I won't stop until I have read everything I can find about, or by C S Lewis."
5,Review of Mere Christianity,It might be helpful for some skeptics of orthodox Christian teachings. I like it because it doesn't come on strong like some Christian apologists books. Tom Dougherty
5,A Christian Classic!,This book gives a purely objective view on Christianity. C.S. Lewis starts out with the plain facts and just methodically explains why Christianity makes sense. A comprehensive book that flawlessly spells out Christianity! A Must read for all Christians and non-Christians who are seeking the truth.
3,Painfully to the point,"c.s. lewis rationalizes and rerationalizes every aspect of chirstianity, almost to the point that it becomes overwhelming - it is a VERY thorough work with an endless number of metaphors for explaining all aspects of the christian faith."
5,C.S. Lewis is Brilliant,I don't know if he could have possibly covered all the ground he did in any fewer words. It is incredible how he goes from assuming you believe in absolute nothing to getting down the heart of Christianity in a matter of pages. I also like Lewis b/c he often gives credit where credit is due. This book shall stand the test of time.
5,Great book,I've really enjoyed reading this book. The Great Divorce is what turned me onto reading C.S. Lewis and also hearing him quoted by some great preachers. He knows his stuff and presents it in a way that even a reader with just a basic education can read and understand. Anyone looking to dive a little further into their walk with Christ will find this beneficial!
5,C.S. Lewis is amazing,I find his works to be amazing even after my third or forth read through. I cannot not think of anybody else who is better in the field.
3,Good argument but flawed,"Lewis presents a wonderful Apologetic book on x-tian views. Thought provoking and insightful. If you are a x-tian having a crisis of faith and want a little aid then this is the book for you. However, this books argument is essentially flawed. I found several arguments he put forth, that while brilliant are essentially downright wrong. very inspiring though and worth a look."
5,For Skeptics and Believers,"""Mere Christianity"" by C.S Lewis is an erudite, cogent view of Christianity. Skeptics will appreciate Lewis' willingness to look at the harder questions of the Christian God, while true believers will gain confidence as they see the logic of God presented sensibly and pursuaively.Not to be compared with Augustine, or any of the church fathers, Lewis does bring a modern, yet classical examination of what Christianity is and why it is reasonable to believe. He doesn't get caught up in anything but the core and substantive matters of the faith. Lewis is eloquent here in his clarity.For an entertaining and insightful expose of human sin, read his ""Screwtape Letters.""I fully recommend ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S. Lewis.Anthony Trendl"
5,Good Collection,Convenient collection of Lewis. The book is perhaps too heavy to be handled easily by the elderly or infirm.
5,A classic among classics,"Any person, young or old who has the faintest interest in Christianity should read this book. I first read it at least 10 years ago, while serving in the U.S. Army. It is one of those books that you find yourself thinking about for weeks after you've read it. If you're curious, if you're just interested in the classics of religious literature, buy this book."
5,Christianity: Simply Explained,"C.S. Lewis is a well known author for many reasons, and for many books. My very favorite of his books is ""Mere Christianity"" which can be read by both branches of Christianity.....Protestant, and Catholic alike, and enjoyed by those who are new to this religion. The explanations given are just as valid today, as when C. S. Lewis wrote them way back when! I highly recomend this book to the new Christian, and to the old one alike. This book is both inspiring and captivating!"
5,Essential Reading,"One of the top Christian books on apologetics ever written. A very personal account...moving and persuasive. If you're a Christian, it will bolster your faith and make you smile. If you're not, you may very well be after reading this wonderful book."
5,This is the book that changed my life,"I was raised in a Christian family and attended Sunday School faithfully all through my childhood; but until I read Mere Christianity, I never really understood my relationship with God -- and His with me. Back in college, in '73, I borrowed some books from a friend and she slipped it in, saying, ""You might enjoy this, too."" Well, by the time I finished it, Christ -- the living Lord -- became so real to me, I asked Him to forgive me and lead me. Now, 25 years later, I still reread this book several times each year! Sometimes the Bible is hard for newcomers to get into so, I take a paperback copy of it with me on airline flights, and leave one in the seatback pocket, inscribed, ""A friend left me here for you!"" That's because it meant so much to me, and I believe it is the best explanation of Christianity ever written. You might want to invest in spreading the Word this way, too!"
5,Beyond this world....,"wonderful, thought provoking, massively intellectual (and way too much for me) - it's a constant re-read. Some of his thoughts go way over my head and I am not on his wave length intellectually or iq - but somethings I totally get - and he talks sense (when I get it). I take some, i leave what I don't get, but that is the beauty of the journey of christianity - not just questioning - but realising that it just IS. and knowing that is just AWESOME!"
4,Mere Christianity Review,"I have just received this book in the mail today. I am glad to say it's not beaten up like any other packages I received through amazon so that was a plus. Also The book was in great condition, I bought it used and it looks brand new. being a student in college I will have to say this is one book that if required, this is the best way to get it. if you have a problem with getting it then I guess it's bad luck so I would highly recommend ordering this book."
5,Merely Life Changing,"There is nothing ""Mere"" about this book; it will merely change your life. Lewis lays out in plain english a logical argument for the existence of God and the definitive apologetic for christianity since St. Thomas Aquinis. His use of metaphore makes difficult abstract concepts understandable. Christianity claims to change lives and Mere Christianity lives up to its name. A must read for anyone seriously seeking the truth."
2,"Took me by surprise, a real surprise","I was pretty happy and satisfy with all my past purchases with Amazon.All the used books I bought were pretty decent and in good condition.Until, Bellwether Books shipped me the C.S. Lewis Classics: Mere Christianity, The Screwtape...I am astonished by the very poor quality of the books: the paper, tailoring and binding are so inferior which I never experienced. The pages are so insecurely bind that they might fall off in matter of time; the paper is so coarse like commercial paper towel that is used in the public restroom. The pages are so unevenly cut and are mostly larger than the book cover.All I can only hope that C.S. Lewis' ideas and his writing will give me the pleasure in reading.Frankly, I never have such bad experience with used book purchase until now with Bellwether Books.Surprisingly, the seller stated the book as good or very good condition."
4,Great author,"Great books by a great author; Screwtape letters really makes you think. I can't wait to read the rest of the works. The book itself, however, was HUGE! I was not expecting it to be the size of a textbook haha. Thick, yes, but tall and wide? No."
4,Beautiful But BIG Book,"This is a very beautiful book containing several of the classic works of CS Lewis. My only remark is that I did not anticipate how big it is. Please note the size. This is a 'coffee table book' NOT a 'bookshelf book'. It would be nice if the same item were available in a shelf-friendly size. Even so, it is an excellent collection."
5,Mere christianity,"I felt that I was given pieces of a jig-saw that I did not know were missing, and this enabled me to see pictures I was not aware God had been preparing. If you know the code this book will be a revelation. If not I pray for you."
5,great perspective,This was my first C.S. Lewis book and I found it so interesting that he approaches the Christian faith from such a straight forward and practical perspective- especially him previously being an atheist! Very interesting.
3,A good introduction to conventional christian thinking.,"I'm not a Christian and on a polemical level I didn't find this book to be very persuasive. It contained a lot of after-the-fact reasoning to justify pre-existing beliefs. Of course, the same could be said for almost all books about religion or politics. It is a fairly succinct account on how many Christians think so I can recommend it to people who want to learn more about Christianity."
5,An Eminently Logical Case for the Christian Faith,"Mere Christianity is one of the two best logical logical cases for the Christian faith I have read. Lewis first brilliantly lays a foundation, logically showing that the universe (external and internal) demands logically that some form of God exists. He then compares various theories of God with what we find in reality, and finds that only the Christian one honestly stands. At this point, he continues into details of the Christian faith. Any one honestly seeking to understand Christianity, and/or trying to decide if it is true, will find a powerful, rational case here for ""yes."" The other book I mentioned is Charles Colson's How Now Shall We Live, whose conlusions are based on real-life studies and experiences, rather the more pure logical base of Lewis' writing. They are two halves of a whole perspective, the theory and the application, and I would especially suggest both to any Christian reader."
5,An orginal thinker,An orginal thinker that is suited for our times that is rampant with seculiar thinking that leading to moral decay
1,Book Quality,"This is not a review of Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis was a genius.This is on the quality or better yet the lack of quality of the manufacture of this book; the paper is the cheapest grade imagineable,the binding is also very low grade, and to top it off the publisher didn't cut the pages evenly.I thought for the price they were charging the paper and binding would be of good quality, needless to say I was greatly mistaken.Buy a paperpack edition from another publisher, you'll get a much better made book and save money at the same time."
3,great material in poor form,This book is gigantic--the size of an over-sized coffee table book. Very hard to hold and read.
2,"Eh, I'm not impressed","As an atheist, I thought that maybe reading ""Mere Christianity"" would give me some insight into why intelligent Christians can believe what they do. Unfortunately, it did not. The book's logic is often (usually!) shoddy and I learned more by visiting a church one day and speaking to the pastor for 15 minutes than from reading this entire book.I don't know, I didn't care for this book. It is well written in an easy to read fashion, but don't let that fool you: behind its pretty exterior lies a whole lot of gobbledy-gook and nonsense. If you want intelligent Christian thought, go talk to an educated member of the clergy because you won't find it here."
1,Disappointing,"Lewis fails to support any of this major claims and fails to take seriously any argument other than his own. I was very disappointed as many have spoken well of this book.His ""argument"" would only appeal to someone who is already a Christian; non-Christians who are looking for a good logical argument supporting Christianity will be disappointed.The book's version of a water-down version of Plato's theory of forms--spiced up with a touch of Aristotle--represents, at best, middle-brow religious theorizing."
2,Is this it?,"I had high expectations for this book, but it seems that C.S. Lewis is just saying the same things over and over again to justify his own transformation from an atheist into a Christian. Interesting historically, as a Christian response to WWII, but not very useful in a modern quest for Answers."
2,You cannot fathom C.S. Lewis; he has no depth.,"I'm not a Neitsche fan, but I paraphrase him above since it certainly applies here. C.S. Lewis gives a prosaic overview of why he chose to be a Christian. In lieu of honest inquiry he proffers flowery postulates with barely a hint of evidence. This is not a bad book if you're looking for a plausible excuse to be religious; but if you're not afraid to take a closer look at Christianity, read something like Dan Barker's ""Losing Faith in Faith"". Or, for a closer look at religion in general, read Campbell's four-book series entitled ""The Masks of God""."
1,Oh please... is it something in the water?,"The title shoud be changed to ""I'm now a Christian and here's why...."" I won't even bother to discuss the silly analogies and ridiculous attempts at logic to be found in this ""masterpeice"" of his. This book is great to Christians merely because it is a written example of one who has ""chosen the light"" and had a PhD, hooray! Also, the mere idea that there's still a war between science and religion in 2001 should baffle everyone and those responsible should find better, more constructive things to do with their life. If you are seeking the Truth, look to those whom you trust and ask them. Or look inside yourself for the answers, most are already there. Good luck to everyone and may God have mercy on your souls."
2,"Review of ""Mere Christianity""","Perhaps I'm confused, but by Book II: Part 3 'The Shocking Alternative', it seems to me that with the sentence ""God created things which had free will"", C.S. Lewis had decided that the concept of ""god"" is a given, and the Christian view that ""this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been"" becomes the basis upon which the remained of the book is built.Maybe I misunderstood, but it is at this point he lost my interest. I thought I would be reading objective intellectial text, I am mistaken."
5,Practically handy,"In times when the morality and the common human sense seems to be in decay due to the relativity subjected to these concepts, Lewis, in an understandable way and with a variety of examples, elucidate the reality of right and wrong hidden in the human being exposed as the Law of nature. With that, as a start point, the author give sense, in many ways, to the human behavior and clarify why the christian moral is the most proper way for a person to live."
2,Not a timeless text,"The novel contains some unkosher stereotypes that detract from the sincerity of Isadora Zelda's enlightenment. Isadora seeks to create an unmolded definition of herself -- a non-suicidal, female artist free of male obsession. However, she mocks her African-American brother-in-law for being white because he is a wealthy doctor who enjoys golf (as if he is not allowed to define himself outside of typical views). Isadora wants others to value her poetry but mocks all greasy (her words) Arabs for writing poems. She wants a lover who will understand her complexity. Nonetheless, she takes the close-minded attitude that all Germans loved Hitler. Stereotypes and racial bias litter the novel (even her second husband is an inscrutable -her words again- Chinese man). I could not enjoy Isadora's rise to empowerment because her accent seemed dependent upon the lowering and dismissing of other people."
2,**Hooray**For the Symbolism...**Boo**For the Plot,"A very trippy novel filled with Freudian imagery! The explicit erotic fantasies and ""bitchiness"" of the main character, Isadora Wing, were entertaining. However, I found it to be very depressing in general. Although it is refreshing to see a female author write with such sexual inhibition....the plot seems to be lacking realism. Isadora actually made me nauseous at times with her bad selection of boy toys! I think a visit from the personal hygeine fairy would have been nice. She was definitely a woman who was playing with a few cards short of a full deck! In my opinion the first few chapters were the best...and the conclusion was disappointing and left me wanting more closure between Isadora & her husband!"
4,Fear of Flying: Fear of Life,"This book was being gestated before I was, yet its messages still ring true. Women are still struggling with the search for the love, what it means to be a ""good"" woman, what it means to be a woman at all. Writers (aka: me) still struggle with the urge to write, the fear to write, the fear of failure, the search for self. Part rant, part story, part stream of consciousness, the sentiments/fears/etc. in this book hit very close to home, yet do give a hint of hope - we can find our way through the wilderness of life, and it's worth the living."
2,"Yup, it's LIT","I was searching for the words to review this book for you, so I was scanning through other reviews to see if anyone else had the same feel for it I did. Then I read this: ""Every woman, every man should read this book it gives great insight on the insecurities of women. From sentence one I felt like Isadora Zelda White Wing spoke to me of my own doubts and emotional struggles. All of a sudden I was not alone...I was not lost, her journey was mine and mine hers.""And I realized that this was IT. THIS paragraph was exactly why I can NOT recommend this book. Wish I had read this before I bought it. Oh, boy does it ever ""gives great insight""!! You will hear over and over again about how tormented Isadora's life is, how confused she is. So tormenting of me that I had to put this book down. Tried to pick it up again and again, just couldn't get through it.For those that enjoy this style - enjoy in good health with all your emotional struggles!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Perhaps this was ""on the edge"" years ago - now it is just a very slow read. The main character needs to grow up."
3,A modern woman?,"I decided to read this book based on a conversation with a friend that had read it several times, mostly when first published. I had high expectations for the material and found myself disappointed. The characters are detached and unlikable in my view. The psyches of them are complex which was intriguing, but i would not read it again."
3,Kind....Sorta,"Fear of Flying is a book I liked and could not not understand at the same time. It offered women in a different prospective, but it was more laughter than powering."
3,"Sex, love, and liberation","I am a man, and I read this book because Bob Dylan talks about Erica Jong in one of his songs. Athough no classic, this book is well worth reading. She breaks through some walls regarding women and their sexual role/place. Of course the main character is white, affluent and Jewish so it still suffers from being trapped in the upper-middle class mainstream. It would have been better if the protagonist was an 18 year old skinny black girl from Ethiopia who comes of age in an era of sexual and personal liberation. Nonetheless, read it if only because Bob Dylan talks about her."
3,Fear of Everything,"I had heard so much about how this book was so 'liberating'. It is not at all. It is deeply conservative, if not reactionary. It finally admits that women cannot do without men, are helpless, disorganised, flighty (indeed) and generally useless unless some man with an appendage is telling them what to do. For all her evocations of women writers Isadora is the opposite of them. Is this meant to be her tragedy? Her fear? If so, it never comes across that way. She is too privileged, self-indulgent, whiny and obsessive for us to really care what happens to her. And yet it is funny and in some places deeply inspired. But Portnoy's Complaint was better written."
5,One of favourite books,I read this book ages ago and still can't find anything to compare story to. Love it and I would always recommend it to everyone who like good literature.
4,From Venice present into a past filled with Shakespeare.,"Erica Jong takes her heroine, Jessica, from the Venice Film Festival to the past where she is the Daughter of Shylock. She meets and makes love to William and his male lover. The three of them escape from Shylock with his money and rescue a fair maiden from a fate worse than death in a convent(read that as whorehouse) on an island off the Italian coast. When the novel ends, Jessica is back in New York City, pregnant with William's child. As with any theatrical piece, you must willingly suspend your disbelief and ride out the fantasy. Jong may be the best writer of historical fiction yet with her view of the interactions between men and women."
2,Main character was unlikable,"I couldn't stand the protagonist. Of course, I'm not sure she was MEANT to be likable in the first place, but still, she turned me off. Plus, I had the constant thought running through my head throughout the book, ""So just go get laid already, who really cares?"" I suppose it was a big deal when it was originally written, but nowadays? Totally irrelevant."
2,Waiting for Amazon.com censors......,"Fear of Flying (FOF) upset me, a male reader. Protagonist Isidora likes to sleep around, and since 'effing' was so critical to her, she should have become a hooker. My sympathies lie with the poor husband(s) who are apparently clueless and/or insane. Women's lib as depicted in this book is a phony exercise where women attempt 'equal' status with men 'plus' their usual treachery and guile. BTW, this is a redone review after PC amazon censors blocked the first."
2,So what?,"Here we have a woman who didn't know if she loves or not her husband and want an affair, if you tell me that that is the way that all the women think I really don't agree with that, I don't really think that this book could save any marriage or even any relation, having an affair is against all the laws, but many people do that (I said many not all) and I think that if one is having an affair he or she will not tell the New York Times, this things are secretes always or almost always.This book has to many pages that doesn't say anything or what it says is out of range of any book, but why she has to returned to her husband? I thing that Isadora really needs help."
1,A disappointing book.,"The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit, I guess). What a turn-off."
4,Great book about real person,"While there are many levels to this book (see the reviews below), what particularly appealed to me was its author's call to courage. In short, ""Fear of Flying"" is inspiring (to me) in that its main character is a very recognizable person who attempts to deal with very recognizable fears and anxieties. I have read it with great enjoyment on more than one occasion, each time being left with new insights and perspectives. Thankyou, Erica Jong."
1,Protofeminist Psychobabble--Not Worth Your Time,"I tried giving it a shot but the book is (1) not sexy, as it is marketed, (2) about a lurid main character/narrator whom I can't follow, (3) filled with 1970s-style Freudian psycho-bull that attempts, amateurishly, to explain gender roles and relations, and (4) very solipsistic. It doesn't seem at all like fiction but the bickerings of a sexually frustrated woman who thinks too much about herself and who doesn't seem to be all that bright but manages to parade under some kind of feministic pseudo-intellectual banner. I just found the narrator despicable and didn't finish the book. I can't believe it has such a high review on Amazon, which means, I guess, that the majority of people reading it in 2011 are people who are already sympathetic to the book or author.Don't bother. If you want sex pick up Anais Nin or Zane or Philip Roth--anything else that has a story or good prose style, just not this."
5,a sexual odyssey in search of identity and secure attachment,"Erica Jong takes us on an intrapsychic merry-go-round as her heroine searches for the right blend of sexual satisfaction, secure attachment and love. Her lusty odyssey is tempered by her self-deprecating humour and ambivalent relationships with psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts.This book remains a groundbreaking classic and opens our eyes to the progression of feminine sensibility.Alan Eppel author of ""Sweet Sorrow: Love, Loss and Attachment in Human Life"".Sweet Sorrow: Love, Loss and Attachment In Human Life"
2,Not at all the feminist work I'd imagined,Seemed to be an experiment in stream of consciousness with a storyline. The constant thoughts of the character seem to interfere with the book. There is odd sexual situations and thoughts which I assume was very provocative at the time but now are just like amateur literotica. Not recommended.
2,"Please quit leaving out pages, Nabu Press","Bancroft and Zumpt did a great job with the content. Nabu Press's print job is blurry, but the free Google ebook also has blurry printing. Maybe no clearly-printed exemplars exist. Nabu Press says on an end-paper: ""This book may have occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. that were either part of the original artifact, or were introduced by the scanning process."" Nabu did indeed leave pages 136 and 137 out of this book. I got this book on a sale for something like 7 or 8 dollars. I am not going to pay full price for Nabu Press books until they give up their right to omit pages. The paper and ink are fine. If Nabu has worked from a clearly-printed exemplar, the book would probably be an excellent print-on-demand. Until Nabu Press quits excusing itself for bad workmanship on its books, I will only be tempted to buy their books when they are at a 2/3 discount."
5,Love the sets!,I ordered all of the seasons for my husband as a Christmas present. We have absolutely no complaints. Love the series!
3,Could Have Been Better,"Could have been better but the Lisa, wedding storylines were dumb. There are various episodes which weren't funny at all but alas a great show all around. What was this show & Martin, they were one of the best comedies of the 90's."
2,Getting Worse,"I should have known better, these movies are not getting any better, just the opposite. I hope this is the last one."
1,This movie sucked,Its bulls***. Do not watch this movie. I hate it. Its stupid. Guuur! Its a waste of money. I got ripped off....
1,Don't waste your money,"I thought I had ordered something else this movie realy had nothing to, it waste of my time and money and now I own it."
2,Abnormal Activity 4 Review,I was very disappointed in this film. It was not scary or very realistic. It was just not what I expected based on trailers about the movie. I would not recommend it due to stated reasons.
3,Horrible sound issues,"Movie aside, it took three separate sittings to get the sound to keep from dropping out or never coming in to finish the show. Unacceptable!"
1,Bastards,This was the stupidest film ever and I want to slap whoever took my $3 to rent this trash!! Maybe I was expecting something totally different than what i recieved when I clicked play or this was seriously the most tard movie I have ever watched in history
4,Good product for a good deal,I had been looking for a workout pant and these were on sale. they fit well and are lightweight so I'm happily satisfied with the purchase.
3,Amazon Verified purchase of Champion flare leg pant,The pants arrived in a timely manner. But One leg in each pair was irregular. Starting from the knee there is a curve toward the front instead of being staight down.
4,If you want the original 300 minute production....,"This is an extraordinary production in every respect. However, I'm only giving it a 4 star rating because it's an abridged version of the full 300 minute original. If you want to savor every heartfelt minute of the original 300, consider buying Moses the Lawgiver for Regions 1 (US and Canada) and 4 (Central and South America). This two DVD set plays on American DVD players and has English audio. At the present time, the Region 1 and 4 DVD is available through Amazon.com. You don't have to make do with the abridged version, or pay out for a DVD player to play Region 2 (Europe) as one reviewer did. Stay closer to home and buy this one marketed for Latin America (with the original English audio)!"
3,Studio....please release the complete mini-series!,"This is a beautiful telling of the Moses storey. The antithesis of the Cecile B DeMille's over-the-top (but enjoyable) version.This is a very understated, and therefore entirely realistic version of how it could have happened.The edited version is acceptable, but I recall that the full version really conveyed a sense of the epic journey, which this compressed version, simply does not.Hopefully the studios will give it a good digital clean up and release the full version in the near future.Furthermore, the musical score is one of Ennio Morricone's best....not to be missed!"
4,Reliving the Exodus,"What can I say about the Movie ""Moses"" Staring Burt Lancaster other than it does an excelent job of actually following the Book of Exodus in the Bible. THe directors try to keeep the charachter Moses to how he was potrayed in the Bible. Moses stutters so his brother speaks for him to Pharoah. The plagues and the parting of the Red Sea has such realism that you can picture the biblical descprition while viewing it. Mannafalls from the trees like bread from heaven.I reccommend this version of the story of the Exodus over any other due to its absolute parralelism with the Biblical Story."
1,WOOF!,"Hard to imagine that a film with Burt Lancaster, Irene Pappas and Ingrid Thulin, and with music composed by Morricone could be so bad. However, the Video Hound Golden Retriever gives it a well-deserved ""WOOF!"", the lowest rating for those who don't know the book. An introspective Moses is fine, but the remainder of the cast is underused and underserved. What hurts most is the anachronistic expresssion of ideas expressed in equally anachronistic language. A good alternative to this and Demille's Ten Commandments glitz is Moses featuring Ben Kingsley."
1,Burt most have needed the $$.,"Great actor, absolutely terrible movie. So bad that it is almost funny."
3,Some parts still sadly relevant,Interesting look at Egyptian women's lives. It sounded like the 1950's or 60's but I was surprised to see the book was published in 1980. I hope things have improved since then but I think her observation that women will continue to be subjugated by men as long as they do not have any valid means of supporting themselves is fairly true. It was a bit of a surprise to read her theory linking the evils of Capitalism and women's issues- freeing women from unpaid labour in the house to being used as a cheap sources of Labour.
3,Not as exciting as I was led to believe,"This book promises to help you make a bunch of interactive toys. Most of the toys are essentially stuffed animals. Many have pockets to hold other items, a few with magnets or velcro to attach to the child, other toys, etc. The games feature standards like ring toss, bean bag toss, matching, tic-tac-toe. There are a handful of puppets and dolls- again very standard- pop-up, topsy-turvy, etc.Based on the photos of the book, I expected original concepts for soft toy making. The author has a wonderful sense of color, whimsy, and pattern. I had high expectations. I was disappointed to find the usual types of cloth toys and games from my own childhood rather than new and innovative games and uses of materials. If I take the time to make these toys, I just don't see them really inspiring my children's play time."
2,Should be Titled 'No-Sew' Playful Toys,"I am dissappointed by the projects in this book. In many cases, the instructions indicate that parts should be glued together when sewing them together would be simple enough and would increase the longevity of the finished work (important considering the end user). The pictures are nice and make the projects look good, but time and again I have picked up this book thinking I will make something for my kids and put it down in frustration realizing that there isn't a project in the book that I want to do."
2,Very Basic,"This book reads more like a college term paper than a book. Perhaps it was based on the listing that it was also published in the Journal of Housing for the Elderly. The tables are very poorly formatted (sideways, what is that about?) and mostly not very informative. I am researching to open a Residential Care Service and I would say of the 106 short pages in this book I found maybe 10 of them useful or interesting. Also note that the book was written in 1991 so all of the demographic and pricing information is 18 years out of date."
5,Definetly Fuse's best english book,"Tomoko Fuse is popular for her amazing origami figures that she creates with unique units (over 50 books in print). This book is no exeption. Possibly her best book ever, this book is a combination of all her most interesting items taken from her other books in Japanese and Korean. I own a few of the forgein language books and I find many things in the book that I enjoy folding, and many that I hate. This book has MOST of the cooler items from her most famous books. If you are a fan of unit origami or just like geometry, then buy this book."
3,A Fun little game,"This unique little game lets you fly rc helicopters, it involes the use of both joysticks to piolt you copter though the different trials. It's pretty fun, but with there isn't a whole lot to do in the game. If it had an battle mode or something..."
3,Useful once you are there,"This book is unbelievably detailed when it comes to trails to hike etc. However the book is fatally flawed (for me) in that it has absolutely *no* information about lodging! I am planning a trip to Montana with my three kids and I wanted to know about where to stay in Glacier Park, whether we should consider a ranch stay, and if there were once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as a dinosaur dig or a wagon train ride. Not one of these questions were answered by this book! However, once you are at Glacier I imagine the detailed information about trails and scenery (and a few stores etc) would be quite useful."
4,"Powerful and uplifting. You should visit ""Garden's Corner""","When I finished the first chapter of Garden's Corner, I must admit I was a bit skeptical about where it was going to take me. However once inside Little Speedy Copeland's world I didn't want to put it down. I filt there was such a presence of spirit in this young man as I followed along in his journey. Speedy Copeland is enduring and dynamic. This book is filled with issues most of us may have had to face at some point in our lives. From family and friends to testing our faith.With out a doubt ""Garden's Corner"" and it's characters are filled with the power of living spirit. I sincerely look forward to future works by the author."

5,"A wonderful, colorful accounting of Mr. Green's work","Conroy has done a splendid job of putting together the works of Jonathan Green. Not only does the book show Green's unique style to best advantage, but includes great information about the Gullah people and the artist. A must have book for anyone interested in the Gullahs or Jonathan Green."
5,Classic Lenin,"Democratic Centralism, the whys and wherefores along with history and positions detailing the split within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Some of the references that Lenin makes would have been easily known in his time though for us, checking the writings of Karl Kautsky and Plekhanov are recommended as with most of Lenin's works. If one cannot find the works of the above mentioned see [...]"
4,Bohemian Brigade,"A very readable book. Sometimes humorous, always informative and flows like Perry's articles in the WSJ. What more can you ask of a book? It's fun to read."
2,Not working for my dog,"I have a 70lb dog, very hyper, extremely excited when he sees other dogs or small children, this halter doesn't work for my dog."
2,waste of money for lg dogs,did not work for my dogs. waste of money. easy to return.still looking for one that is simple and works. i have mastiffs and found it flimsey.maybe it works for small dogs
5,Uke Of Ages Swings & Grooves,"Dan Sawyer's Uke Of Ages is a beautifully conceived, arranged and performed collection of eclectic songs for this unique instrument. The selections, of various styles, have kept me entertained over and over. The swinging Sheik, the grooving Sloop John B, Coming Home, the lyrical When You Wish Upon A Star, and his fine vocal style make this a winner for me! It's a one-of-a-kind. Five stars!"
2,NOT WORTH THE $80,"I was pleased with the service of the company, but the seat cover is NOT worth $80. It was a little too short for my Tahoe, even though I got the XL. I do like the fact it covers part of the floor and for the most part stays in place. I have 3 large dogs (lab, german shepard, and a great dane), and with all 3 of them in the back seat, the seat cover did not move. I just think the price they charge for these things is way too much and I think this works just as well as other seat covers out there that cost a lot less"
5,This is the best album ever!,"Ralph Stanley II really has a lot to look forward to. This new album is nothing but great. Every song is wonderful, and I guarantee this one will not come out of your cd player for a long time, it's that good. Pathway of Danger is my personal favorite."
4,Tantrum tamer.,"My son received this as a Christmas gift when he was 2 1/2 months old. Now 5 months, he's still a little too young to execute the movement, but the ""press the button, then ponies go 'round"" concept continues to fascinate him. It sits on the top shelf of his bookcase and after a traumatic diaper change, we walk over and spin the ponies . . . crying bout ends!"
3,"OK, i guess","Although the problems and tests were good for review, the writer doesn't seem to know much about the structure of the SAT. Of the last two fifteen minute sections, one should be a math section, and the other a paired passage, but on one of the practice tests (i have closely looked at all of them) both were math. His strategies were average; i already knew most of them, and didn't think the rest were that great. Personally, i prefer the Kaplan Methods. (Take their prep course. It helps!)"
2,FUTUREDOC,"I have been through most of the test preperation books in the market, but this I was very optimistic upon coming to this book. The book itself is not written in a ""user-friendly"" manner, and the best parts of this book are the 3,500 word vocab list. The math section is very comprehensive, however, the questions are a lot harder than those found on the SAT, which eventually starts to discourage you. I verbal review sections are practically useless, and the strategies do not work. Once again, buy this book only for the vocabulary list, and then move on to some other book (such as kaplan, etc...). This list will give you the foundation to answer analogies and sentencecompletions but nothing more...The practice tests are quite useless, and are much harder than that found on the real SAT...Good luck on you test preperation"
3,Vocab List Good,Yeah so this has a very comprehensive SAT Vocab list which I did over the summer and I scored a 770 in Verbal (I'm a big reader too) for an overall 1490 though I didn't use it for the math and I'll now be attending Columbia University. So if you're looking for THE vocab list...dig this book.
1,"Typos, typos, and imbecilities","There are SO many typos in the answer keys of some of the exercises [I feel that it] render almost all the sample tests useless (unless one goes back question by question to find all the errors, and since one is unlikely to go back to look at a question believed to have been answered correctly, one doesn't actually know how well one has done.) Worse, in the section meant to analyze capabilities, [I feel] it is often assumed that one doesn't know how to do a question -- and hence the only correct answer is to say that one has guessed!As a result, one may be misled to work on a course of study that is unnecessary, and miss the one that is!A shocking piece of work."
4,"it's great, the best song is drive me wild",this is a great album!! the band is sooo hot the best song is drive me wild
2,"Below average CD, I was left very disappointed","This is probably the worst CD Sawyer Brown has ever came out with. Out of the 11 songs, only about 4 are worth listening to. I recommend you listen to it before you waste any of your hard earned cash on this."
5,"This is a cool album,",I really like the way mark moves on stage.He really got the moves for all of his songs.
4,High Quality Music- One of Their Best,"I have never been a huge fan of Sawyer Brown but liked some of their songs. I bought this CD because I really like ""Drive Me Wild"" and after listening to the whole CD a few times I was amazed my how good all of the songs are. My favorites are ""Moon Over Miami"", ""800 Pound Jesus"", ""It All Comes Down To Love"" and ""We're Everything To Me"". It is obvious that this group spent considerable time creating this album with the excellent writing, producing and singing. I have about 5 Sawyer Brown CDs and this is my favorite. Highly recommended for any country music fan."
2,a story hidden in words,"Way too many names, Way too much detail.There is a story hidden in this book, but it is hard to dig it out. It could have been a good read."
2,English to Russian Dictionary,This dictionary only translates from English into Russian so it is likely to be nearly worthless for native English speakers.
5,This practice can change your life.,"Working with the Divine Light Invocation has changed my life, and this book presents clear instructions for how to do the invocation. It also includes the history of the Divine Light Invocation and questions by students and answers by the author. This book is essential for anyone interested in bringing more light into their lives."
5,A lovely book,"A lovely ramble with a fascinating old gentleman, quaint, charming, sunny and a true picture of one aspect of a bygone age and of the way our great-great grandfathers talked and lived. The fishing lore and natural history are hopelessly out of date but who cares? Has been in print for centuries and deservedly so."
2,"self-absorbed, rambling, scattered, disjointed....","For the life of me, I don't see what people get out of Kathleen Norris' writing! Her thoughts are jumbled, scattered, rambling, disjointed, and highly self-absorbed to boot!If you want to read a REAL book about monastic life, I recommend The Genessee Diary. Pass on this one. I feel that I've completely wasted the few hours I spent trudging through this tome."
4,The Author's Spiritual Journey Defined By Creative Thought,"This book received excellent reviews; I had to satisfy my curiosity and read it. I slowly read, hoping to discover some great truths I may have missed these past 6 decades.The book is unique in that the author explains how monks and nuns live, work, and worship together in communities and also how she had the freedom to come and go as she pleased, worshipping in her protestant church as well.This is a nice book for tolerant people of any faith. Everyone can benefit from quiet reflection, from reading scripture, from singing hymns, and from praying. We all have the freedom to worship God in different ways. Kathleen Norris was curious about the catholic faith, although she remains a protestant. Her experience within the monastery is beneficial to her soul and she describes how, as a poet and writer, the rituals, liturgy, and hospitality within the monastic setting further her own understanding of spirituality."
2,Please Walk Away,"Beneath its beautiful cover this book started well then rapidly became a modernist exercise in denunciation of matters, beliefs, situations that find Kathleen Norris' disfavor. She hides her complaints well at first with her pretense of praise for the ancient Benedictine traditions, but like M. Scott Peck's In Search of Stones, which this work reminds me of so much, it soon becomes clear the topics within have varying degrees of subject matter in common with what this misleadingly marketed book is about. I wanted a book about modern Benedictines and the experience of residing among them and instead got a bellicose, self-obsessed, self-congratulatory account of times selectively spent brushing up against a semi-monastic existence. A boring, frustrating, sometimes almost unfathomable letdown because in description The Cloister Walk sounded so good."
3,"Good book, but not as good as I expected","I was very looking forward to reading this book because it came highly recommended and because it seemed to be a guide for walking in the footsteps of many dedicated Christians. I am sorry to say that I was a little disappointed. Although many parts of the book are really excellent, Ms. Norris spends too much time making commentary instead of just sharing the experience. I really enjoyed when she shared how she was moved by prayer, to a point of conversion. And how the experience of the cloister strengthened her sense of self, and her marriage. But the chapter on St. Maria Goretti, while making a valid point, was overkill. Still it is worth the effort through the tedious parts, for the nuggets of wisdom which are also to be found there. My recommendation, skip over the platitudes and embrace the jewels."
3,"Interesting, at times preachy & generally worth reading","This is one woman's journey, sketching her life, her troubles, and her spiritual salvation through a Benedictine Monastery. Quoting the Bible extensively, Ms. Norris tells of her experiences with the Monks and Nuns. She is a writer, a searcher and a poet. Words are her vehicle to explain life and God. She sees the poetic in the mundane, and the special in the everyday. It is worth reading, even for people who are ""non-biblical"". I found it interesting. The cover blurb reads "". . .Strange & Interesting . . ."" which is apropo."
2,Mixed Blessings,"Norris' book was so highly praised that some disappointment was inevitable. There are some good insights, but they're mixed in with pompous, snobblish, quirky, cranky, and deliberately obtuse comments. Her language is frequently adolescent, with pointless vulgarity or slang. She is remarkably self-centered. Her model for this is Thomas Merton, but it's a pity she imitates all his worst habits!"
3,Wonderful but flawed book,"Kathleen Norris is a terrific writer, and everyone says so, it seems. She has the poets gift for finding beauty everywhere, and makes you want to see Lemmon, S. D. which is no mean feat, I'm sure. Her account of her experiences with the Benedictine monks is wonderful, generally. And she has that great gift of seeming to write for all of us.My only objection to the book has nothing to do with style, or her lyrical prose, but with her use of obscenity-twice- about a third of the way through. It is just so unnecessary--even if you don't see it as wrong--for this to be found in a book on Christian Spirituality. To me, it keeps me from recommending the book to some who might otherwise really benefit from seeing the world through Kathleen Norris' eyes. Which is a real shame."
2,Not what I thought,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. I tried to stay with it, thinking it might get better but ended up putting it down after about half way.The author focuses more on her personal, anecdotal stories then her actual time spent in the monastery living among the vowed. Absent was any insights or conversion gained by her experiences with the religious, which was more what I was looking for.Anyone wanting to understand more about the depths of faith gained from religious life should spend their time and money reading some of the saints instead."
5,Simple Beauty,"I spontaneously picked up this book at the library the other day and have been more than delighted. This book is like reading a series of short stories on different subjects, i.e., marriage, friendship, sex, rural life, and others, but yet is woven in such a way as to thread in her experiences at a Benedictine monastery, which is really the core subject of the book. Her style is quirky and endearing, yet in many ways, fearless.I loved it and can't wait to read her other works."
5,Excellent faith prodding material!,"I loved the book -- used it for my morning devotions for about three weeks, reading a bit a day. Her topical, short chapter focus is perfect for this approach. I also passed it on to my sister who is reading it; we now talk about how we understood each passage as she reads. Great discussion starters."
2,Saddened,"Although Ms. Norris book describes much of the beauty of the Catholic faith, it ultimately is spoiled by conceit and self-promotion. I was dismayed that someone who does not embrace the Catholic faith would have no qualms receiving the Holy Eucharist. Kathleen Norris should stick with describing the Protestant Faith she espouses."
5,"Great smelling ,,,,great feeling cream",I love this product and all Exuviance products..they have a great smell and seem to work well.
4,My Childhood....IN THE 80'S,"Ok. I had the cassette version of this compilation and pretty much wore it out. It's one of those great ""truck stop"" finds that is actually a decent mix of songs from a particular time period. I'm very happy that this comp was a part of my listening rotation at such an early age because it truly was a musical doorway into a lot of the music I obsess over to this day. That's all."
4,A Pleasant Trip Back,"For many of us that came of age in the late 50's and early 60's just before the British invasion of the Beatles and Rolling Stones, these were the songs that impacted us on a daily basis.So here its is many years later, and these songs still have meaning to many of us that lived, loved and played in that era. In many ways reflecting on these songs now is hearing a time when the world was right for the most part. Although few of us would have envisoned what the 60's would eventually bring us.This is the genesis of rock and roll as the baby boomers knew it."
4,Good Practical Advice,"I thought I'd heard every statistic and help tip that existed re: sleep problems and sleep hygiene -- keep your room cold and dark, wear earplugs, etc. But refreshingly, this book had a few tips I hadn't seen or heard elsewhere -- including descriptions of several yoga-like relaxation and meditation exercises to help you unwind.I'm particularly fond of the concept of a ""power down hour"" where you spend a full, committed hour to unwinding before bed. Though it sounds unrealistic in the modern world, that anyone would take a full hour to do this, the cool thing is that 1/2 of this wind-down hour is meant to be devoted to doing what the author calls ""mindless chores"" like folding laundry. Makes a lot of sense to me, to save these chores for late night, when doing them may actually help put you to sleep!There are a lot of tips like this in the book. Highly recommended overall."
3,Too Complex,"The most valuable thing in this book is a longish list of sleep hygiene tips nestled within the four week progeram. It includes things like replacing all the bulbs in your bedroom to those that put out a maximum of forty watts, and taking a power down hour before bed where nothing can be done but mindless chores, hygiene, and stretching. The rest of the book is filled with product plugs and unnecessary facts. The four week program would cause even more anxiety in me about sleeping. For a truly wonderful book on sleep, and one that will help those already on medications without lambasting them, try the Insomnia Answer by Paul Glovinsky."
3,Funny stuff,This is a movie I waited a few years to see only to rent it then see it was on tv the next day or so.....that is irony but it was a good late night flick and I had fun watching it. Not Vince Vaughns funniest stuff but decent and I always like Ben Stiller.....the theme was good as were Stiller's costumes. I also always like it when his wife Christine Taylor makes an appearance in his movies. Worth renting!!!!
3,"Lack of Comedy, but still good","This movie is worth renting but not buying. Theres not alot of funny scenes. My favorite scene was when Patches got electricuted. When Average Joes got their uniforms switched with someone else's, that was definetly NOT cool or funny."
4,Deus Ex Machina,"Pretty much the same review as the others befor it, with one other detail. At the very end, the treasure chest with the 5 million in it has the words ""Deus Ex Machina"" inscribed above the lock. If you don;t know what that means, look it up in a dictionary or dictionary.com. just a funny tidbit."
3,not as good as expected,"Don't get me wrong. I liked this movie. Ben Stiller was awesome! I loved the way all of the camera angles made him look like a little man with expected little-man-syndrome. But, it really came across like a third-rate rip-off of KingPin.There's nothing particularly clever or new here. Go ahead and screen this movie at your party. It will get a lot of laughs. But this is certainly no classic. After seeing Stiller's ""Envy,"" I thought that this would be a big step up. But it really wasn't. This movie really just seems to go through the motions of every recent silly sports flick.High-lights include: Stiller's character (and various antics), the Lance Armstrong scene, the phony historical training videos, the romance between one of ""Average Joe's"" players and the ""Russian"" super dodgeball player, etc.Like I said, I liked it. But it was a let down. This one will not go into my DVD library."
2,"A movie that tries too hard to be funny, and falls flat.","Dodgball has the formula to be a classic. What can be funnier than seeing a bunch of people get pelted with red rubber balls? But somewhere during execution, the film lost whatever magic it may have had. Ben Stiller's character is like a lame version of Zoolander, that tries to be funny, but fails horribly. Vince Vaughn is also not funny and not a likeable character along with his crew of strange outcasts of life. When they got Ben and Vince against each other, I could care less who won.Simple movie goers may like this film, but people looking for a comedy that's more than just stupid one liners (that aren't even good.) Dodgeball does not deliver. When I went to see this movie I expected nothing from it, and I got less. I'm only giving this 2 stars because of a few cheap laughs it had that actualy were successful, other than that, it was a complete failure. One of the worst movies of 2004."
3,goofy fun,"My friend loves silly movies and so we watched the dvd together. An annoying thing is that everytime you choose a feature you have to go through some promos. What a time waster. That is my main problem with the dvd.The movie itself is okay and good for a few laughs. I just don't think it stands up to repeat viewings unless you space them apart, like 6 months."
3,Depending on what you expect,I went into this movie not really expecting a whole lot. What I got in return was a couple good laughs as well as a couple groans. Overall the movie is a fun little ride. While I would not recommend this film to everyone if you enjoy blunt humor and don't expect a lot from a film you may enjoy this one.
3,bwah ha ha ha ha...*snerk* ha ha ha!,"_Dodgeball_ is a movie about ""the little gym that could."" Threatened by foreclosure, the main characters (and boy, are they characters) participate in a dodgeball tournament in order to win enough money to pay off the outstanding debt.In the background, the evil corporate giant is looming, ever threatening to dash the dreams of our daring protagonists.The story is ridiculous, the characters are caricatures, the backdrops are insane, the dialogue is nutty; all in all, this adds up to total hilarity.This is one to purchase and keep in your collection."
2,"Dude, where's my dignity?!","OKay, Ben, not even guys getting hit in the face with [dodge]balls is gonna save you this time. Did they just unfreeze your Starsky charcter and put you in this movie? You're killin me!!!!! Do something different!The rest of the cast was good, although not the same can be said of the jokes. This could have been a thirty minute movie, maybe add another 10 minutes of that kid getting hit with the wrenches.If you love Ben Stiller please ""See all my reviews"""
1,"I don't know, maybe it's just me. I didn't laugh.","I love comedies that are cleverly made. 'Dodgeball' had all of the SNL ingredients and that's what made it old. The concept of a movie based on the game of dodgeball is brilliant, it just wasn't executed right. This could have been a marriage made in heaven with Ben Stiller and a 'Rocky'-type ending. But there's no emotion here and the jokes are stale 90's retro. How many times do you have to throw in a 'lesbian' joke or mock Asian people? I would be ashamed to even be associated with a movie that puts down people who are in the minority.Yes, the film did great at the boxoffice, but so what? The crowd went to see Ben Stiller and the concept of dodgeball. I think this film brought the American comedy to yet another low. Will someone please bring back the great American comedy?"
1,Could this picture be worse???,"I have seen some bad movies in my time but nothing compares to this stinker (well Dumb and Dumber comes close)! The film looks like it was filmed in someone's garage. The lack of any real plot, the lame hokey formulaic sentimentality and the atrocious and overdone (so-called) acting of Ben Stiller (quickly sinking his career into oblivion) leaves one in a stupor or was it nausea? I enjoy a no-brainer as much as anyone but this one requires a lobotomy to derive a feeble laugh. Stay away and please Rawson Marshall Thurber please consider a career change."
4,"Cute, Funniest Sport Movie Since Basketball","Sports movies usually bore me. I'm not much into sports, and I remember ""Any Given Sunday"" seemed to go on longer than the entire football season. Anywho, sport movies seem to work better as comedies. ""Caddyshack"" and ""Happy Gilmore"" made golf actually look interesting and fun. ""The Bad News Bears"" and ""Mr. 3000"" made baseball fun. Even ""Field of Dreams"" made the sport seem spiritual as a movie. This particular film is funny. Great comic performances from all the cast. The film breezes through nicely. There's even a couple of romances. Some good plot twists and fun, fun, fun. Now imagine if t he boys from South Park would have helmed this project..."
1,A Republican Movie,"This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, not even ""stupid"" funny, the people that liked or loved this movie voted for Bush........The Presidential Inauguration of George Bush, now that was funny........The fact that people found this movie funny is simply amazing and reflects the lack of taste so prevalent in our society"
2,More hype without fulfillment,Another movie people rave about being 'hilarious' turns out to be mildly funny at best in a few parts. Wait for the 99 cent rental price.
4,An Awesome Film!!!,"This is a very funny film about a laid-back guy named Peter LaFleur, who is about to lose his decaying gym called Average Joe's because the gym across the street, Globo-Gym owned by White Goodman is a lot better. Peter and his friends must raise $50,000 in 30 days in order to redeem the gym, or White will foreclose on it and turn it into a parking lot. The Average Joe's decide to become a dodgeball team, and the winner gets $50,000. Will the Average Joe's beat White's team and win the money? I highly recommend DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY!!!"
1,double dipping,"American gets dodgeball-grab life by the ball--UK is getting dodgeball uncut-grab life by the balls--more scenes from rip torn and cheerleading backflashes has apparently been taken out from the American release. Don't buy, just wait until they release it uncut. From what I have read online, uncut has some quite hilarious scenes"
2,Could Have Been A Fun Movie For The Kids,"With the slinging of rubber playground balls and the realistic sound of the ball hitting and stinging its mark (how'd they capture that!) and the bathroom humor, this could have been a movie that I enjoyed with my children! HOWEVER, the sexual innuendo and outright poor language, as well as the girl-girl kiss and ""crotch enhancement"" received by the Stiller character makes this a movie that I'm tossing in the trash can. What a drag!"
2,Lame script -- lame lead.,Don't get me wrong. I like the concept behind Dodgeball -- the lowbrow comedy that actual works a couple of times during this otherwise woefully mediocre film. The writing is the worst part. The actors make much of a lot of really unfunny lines -- the dialogue is so off-the-mark that it rarely brings even a smile to the lips. Add to this a male lead who is about as bland and uninteresting as you can imagine -- playing a sort of everyman that you can't even begin to root for -- and Dodgeball becomes a rather bland mess that doesn't live up to the potential of some of its funnier stars (Stephen Root and Ben Stiller at the top of the list).These writers must be related to major Hollywood hitters. No other explanation for how such mediocrity could make it to the screen.
3,Dodge Ball: Unrated = Nothing New,"Let me start off by saying that DodgeBall: Unrated is not all that different. The special features are the ones that change. There are a lot of deleted scenes, that should have been included in the unrated cut (they are filled with sexual content). I would have given this film 4 stars, but you have to search through the special features menu to get the ballsy scenes the back cover promises. All in all, if you like Dodgeball, and you haven't already bought it yet, get this one. Or, if you have Dodgeball, and you want to see the soft-core pornographic dances of the Dodgeball dancers or the three way kiss, then go right ahead!"
4,Dodgeball grabs you and doesn't let go,"This was a surprisingly good movie. It had some solid jokes and overall good story. The characters were very funny, and the game itself was funny. The end seemed predictable, but they mixed up a little bit and this made the movie better. Ben Stiller did a good job playing a crazy character obsessed with working out, losing weight, buying the main characters gym, and a lawyer working with them for the selling of the gym. The movie even had some love in it, and Lance Armstrong made an appearance in it. Overall a good movie to see especially if you want some laughs."
4,one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time,I loved this movie and I would recomend this to any Vince Vaun or Ben Stiller fan. this is a laugh a loud every minuet film and just written very well.
3,Silly Fun,"This movie is what it is - a middle of road mostly slapstick comedy. Expect some cheap laughs and overall lighthearted fun, but don't expect a lot of brain activity either. Exactly as advertised. From an acting standpoint - not the principals worst outing, but not their best (try zoolander)."
4,Funny and worth the time to watch,"Sure it's predictably but it's funny and fun to watch. Ben Stiller and the rest of the cast are great. I especially like the out takes where they show the team getting clocked by the wrench, I'll admit it!!It's a silly movie, just what I like :)"
4,Good rental deal,"I really had an enjoyable time watching this. The characters are marvelously developed and each one has a distinctly funny personality. The script, while cliched, is well written and not over done. Plus, the movie has Chuck Norris in it! How can you go wrong with Chuck Norris? The bottom line is, if you don't mind a slightly cliched movie and have a saturday night to spare, rent this one and have some laughs."
4,Soooo should have used the alternate ending,Shame on the studio for not allowing it. It gets the extra star if they do.
4,Toooooo funny!,"If you're looking for a deep-thinker with intelligent comedy, please back away from this movie slowly and carefully.If you want to laugh until you nearly wet your pants, this is the movie for you!I laughed, and laughed, and laughed some more at this bawdy, stupid comedy. It was just plain funny. The cameos were great, and even though at times Ben Stiller's character began to grate on my nerves because he was trying too hard, it was still laugh out loud funny.The dialogue is ridiculous, and that's what makes it great. And make sure you watch all the way through the end credits! It will leave you with the funniest image to haunt your nightmares in a loooooooong time."
4,"""Money, baby, money!""","I bought this DVD simply because I like Vince Vaughn in comedies. I have been a big fan of his ever since ""Swingers"". I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I was pleasantly surprised. Christine Taylor does a good job, and the supporting cast was surprisingly good. Ben Stiller gets old after awhile with his way, way over-the-top performance (which is a reprise of a very similar part he played in the movie ""Heavyweights""). This isn't Vaughn's best performance, but it was still enjoyable. There isn't a great deal of plot, and what plot there is is pretty predictable, but hey, this isn't that kind of movie. It's not great stuff, but it's good enough to warrant a recommendation from me. Plus, there are a lot of extras plus a commentary track by Vaughn, Stiller, and the director, so this DVD has that going for it. Overall, a keeper."
2,I should have dodged this one.,"Sorry but this movie stunk. Maybe one or two laughs at most. That turd movie ""Envy"" was funnier than this garbage."
1,Campy&Horrible,this film is a walking Sports Cliche&just seems to try to throw everything out there&never makes much sense.still didn't get the real point of the film.I never found the film funny at all.very Campy&nothing stood out for me at all.
1,Lose 90 minutes of your life that you'll never get back.....,"This movie is horrible. I saw it at a matinee because it was doing really well at the box office and I figured if a lot of people were going to see it that it must be pretty funny. Well, that was wrong; this movie was very, very stupid and I didn't laugh once. I would rather spend 90 minutes cleaning the bathroom or reading the dictionary - you get the idea. Don't waste your time. If you're stubborn, then rent it before you buy it so you can see for yourself how stupid this movie is. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are funny guys, but this movie is like a paint by numbers (done by someone with shaky hands)."
2,Purchased for my nephew,"I would never have bought this movie for myself - I think the movie is lame. I borrowed it from my nephew to see it and a friend ""borrowed"" and never returned it. I just bought it because I owed my nephew the movie. There were very few original funny moments in it."
1,What a bunch of Bozos,"This is not exactly top shelf drama. Mostly very juvenile type humor, if you want to call it that. Two thumbs down!"
1,The amount of 4 and 5 star reviews is insane.,"This movie is not in the least bit funny. Ben Stiller is not funny anymore he needs to stop releasing films every two months. Vince Vaughn is NOT FUNNY. Everyone in this film is so satisfied with themselves and they must certainly be cracking up after the director yells cut, but they forgot to make the AUDIENCE laugh along with them. I am sick of hollywood giving us the same three people in every comedy. Harold and Kumar is the best place to go for some fresh faces in comedy and a much funnier and much better over all film experience. Dodgeball is comedy for those smokin the wacky tobacky, or people who just find every little damn thing hilarious. I wish I was so easily amused."
5,You have to like Ben Stiller to like this movie,"but if you do, this is one funny movie. I couldn't stop laughing from beginning to end. The humor is stupid, but in a sort of intellectually cynical way. Stiller is over the top as the owner of the megagym, and deadpan Vince Vaughn sets him off perfectly. This is a great movie to watch in a group!"
5,"Gaar! A beauty o a flim, matey!","I almost snorted spirte out my nose watching this movie.I'll admit, it's not for everyone. If you enjoyed Zoolander, Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle, and Get Shorty, this movie will have you in stitches.I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh."
5,One of the best movies of the year!,"Too funny to describe. We were rolling in the ailes. If you like Vince Vaughn, you'll like this movie."
3,A funny film with great acting,"I really enjoyed this film but it dose have amny stupid moments. The movie is funny from start to finish and the story is good and the acting is also good. Ben Stiller dose a great job as Globolgym's manger, Vince Vaughen plays a decent guy who's gym is about to go under. The film is good when you turn your brain off to amny of the stupid moments like the wrench part. Overall it's a funny film to watch and it will make you laugh."
5,Nice game,I thought this was one of the best sport movies i have ever seen in my life.I liked the actors like Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller I was surprised though because Ben Stiller won best villain at the MTV movie awards.Instead of Rachael McAdams for Mean Girls.I thought the best scene in the movie was when Ben Stiller became that fat guy and he sang Kelis' Milkshake song.I thought it was hilarious and we made un of a fat kid that it was him.But it was hilarious so i recommend you see this movie.
5,Great,"A HILARIOUS movie! Kept me laughing the entire time. Plenty of primitive and crude humor that covers up the fairly simple plot line.By the way, watch through the credits, it's worth it."
3,A descent comedy that wasn't as funny as it should have been,"3 and 1/2 starsI am a big Ben Stiller fan and I also like Vince Vaughn. So, I had some big expectations before watching this movie. While it does have a fair share of laughs, it just wasn't very funny. The movie is about Average Joes Gym, a gym that needs 50,000 dollars to keep the building. So, Vince Vaughn and company form a dodgeball team and enter into a dodgeball tournament to get the money. But, squaring off against them are the people from the popular Globo Gym. They square off in a funny tournament on ESpN 8, the ocho. Vaughn and Stiller are good as are the rest of the cast but this movie wasn't as funny as it could have been. This isn't a good comedy to add to your collection but is a worthy rent with some classic jokes. This is a lot better than BE COOl!!!!!!!! This is a solid comedy that doesn't have enough gas to be one of my favorite comedies."
3,Mindless Comedy,"I saw this film with a bunch of friends and we had a blast despite the movie not leveling my moderate expectations. There's not much to write about here. Ben Stiller is somehow amusing in his MCP mad man way and I thought there were a few average funny scenes.Mind you, I'll watch any Ben Stiller movie that comes out. However when it comes to purchasing , I dont think this movie is really worth owning.Thats all.Sadly there's not much of Dodgeball in it. I was enjoying the game but I wish there were more minutes devouted to it."
2,Highly Dissapointed,"I am really dissapointed in this film. Ben Stiller is hilarious in Starsky And Hutch, but Dogeball dodged me in the wrong way. One thing that I didn't like, was that in the first 2 minutes of the movie, it felt like I already watched it. The rest of the movie just seemed so predictable afterwards, and I got it right on the first try. Usually, this never happens. Dodgeball is more of a rental, or maybe it's not even worth a rental. If you ask me, it's really not that funny. The only part I even smiled was when they called this girl a double 0. I think that's just hilarious, but the rest of the movie was dull. I thought the DVD case was more entertaining than the movie really. It is! Go look at it! Please, don't buy. It's a rental, or even not a rental. Maybe it's a throw away movie considering I've heard the double 0 joke somewhere else. Not funny! Try again Stiller!"
3,derivative,"DODGEBALL follows the same basic plot as SISTER ACT II: do something unusual to raise the cash to allow us to stay where we are.It has its moments -- I enjoyed the pastiche black-and-white educational short to tell us the rules and origins of dodgeball. I also liked the second team that Average Joe's met in Las Vegas -- far more interested in striking a pose than in playing a decent game, and wearing tracksuits that were far too spacious -- but they were on for less than a minute. The second, ultra-dumb commentator was also fun for a while.The rest of it is predictable stuff, and there's not a single original joke in there. Both SPINAL TAP and MORE BAD NEWS have done the inflated penis gag, I'm afraid, guys.But it's an enjoyable, if mindless, way to spend 90 minutes. Probably one for rental rather than purchase.[...]"
1,sucks big red balls,This movie is so stupid and immature. I don't think I laughed once the whole movie. The plot didn't make me care for any of the characters or the lame story. I think maybe this movie was just trying too hard to be funny. Thank God it was just a rental! Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.
1,Weakest Link is the Star,"I saw this movie on an airplane, flying New York to Sao Paulo. A long flight, so I was ready for something lame to pass the time.I got it: something lame.Ben Stiller is the stupidest part of this movie: He doesn't deliver much comedy. He's a Johnny One-Note who made me tired after his first 30 seconds.The rest of the movie was passable. I would have given it 3 stars for being a pleasant way to survive a 10-hour, cramped and crowded flight.But Stiller was so boring, so pointless, so NON-funny, that I knocked the movie down to 1 star.I sense all his movies are like that: overblown, stupid, not funny.Which is too bad, because the supporting cast did OK."
2,"Comedies suck, some might be funny, but...","one thing that is gauronteed with any comedy is that they are poorly made, poorly scripted, poorly acted, stupid wastes of money. This movie is funny, so i guess you can say it does what is supposed to (make you laugh), but there is more to entertainment then stupid sex jokes, and the pain of others (funny but can carry a movie only so far), how about changing things up and making a comedy with a good script, good performances, different forms of humor(not just people getting hit in the face with a ball, it was funny but only after the first few times). 3 out of a 10, it made me laugh, but could have done more."
1,wow,"I gave it one star because two hot girls kissed at the end. Just kidding. This is a movie made for young teenage boys like me who want to see that sort of thing and also have a low intelligence level so that they will laugh when somebody gets hit in the head with a wrench. Forget the fact that they've seen it 20 times in previews on TV. Wow, maybe I took the movie too seriously. I guess it's all just a matter of opinion. Speaking of which, see Napoleon Dynamite! My friend loved Dodgeball and hated Napoleon, and I was the other way around. Go figure."
3,not gray but black color,i bought this one believing it was like a dark gray color to match the interior of my car. Unfortunately is black. The quality is also not that great but is still cute and will hang my car for a while.
4,A TV Event,"Ramona has received international attention. The Mexican TV has taken the book to the TV screen. Currently, the production is being presented in a local Hispanic TV channel."
3,Truly a work of fiction...,"While appreciating what Helen Hunt Jackson was trying to do with Ramona, there are some aspects of the book which truly bother me. One can't help but wonder at her glossed over, hisoricaly nostaligic view of the mission system in California. The Native Americans who were in this system were kept in virtual bondage and horribly abused, both physicaly and sexualy and were forced to give up the lifestyles that they had known. I think Ramona has good intention, but like Uncle Tom's Cabin, the book it was modeled after, suffers from a severe case of historical nostalgia. It is, however, interesting to read the book from a modern perspective in the sense that reform literature has certanly changeg over the years! A good read, just beware of the hisorical inacuracies."
3,An interesting interpretation of history,"I admit it...I never in a million years would have read Ramona, if not forced to do so by my history professor for a class in race & ethnicity in American History. However, having said that, I found the book a thoroughly enjoyable read...overdramaticized, yes, but we can forgive it when we consider the original date of publication. However, it is the story behind the story that is most interesting. What Ramona truly is....a middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an Indian. Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's. This is her most recognized and extensive work. So the next time you read it, if you read between the lines, you will see HER innate prejudices and assumptions. But,like I said, I enjoyed it immensely and reccomend it as a fun read...but don't take it too literally...it is after all, fiction"
5,One of the best books written about how the indigenous population of California was affected by the change in government.,"Although this is entirely a work of fiction, the author, Helen Hunt Jackson, spent a significant amount of time with the indigenous population of California and asked them extensively about how they felt about their land changing hands from the government of Mexico to that of the United States of America. This is a must-read for everyone who lives and have lived in California, so they can gain a much clearer perspective of what it means to be a Californian. As painful as it is to read about Ramona's life experiences, it is humbling to know what she went through. It leaves the reader wanting to know what happens next."
5,It's a Fit!,It's perfect. Purchased one that was supposed to be for a Prius but it didn't fit the way this one does. I'm so pleased I'm going to purchase the one that goes on the back now. Thanks.
2,2003 prius sun shade,"Product works very well and fits very better than any sun shade product, however the shade is very stiff and hard to move, fold or unfold. difficult to roll up. i wish they would have explained how un flexible the shade was."
1,Terrible,"Does not fit the window in our 2008 Prius at all. In fact the left side of the shade is considerable taller than the right. Not sure who was in charge of quality control the day they made ours, but they must have been drunk.It does seem to be made of quality materials, but what does that matter when it can't be used due to the incorrect size?The shade is also far too bulky when rolled up. Not a problem if you don't ever plan on having people ride in your back seat or if you don't mind storing it in the hatch and getting it out of there whenever you park or don't mind taking it down and storing it back there when you leave.All in all this thing gets an F from me. I honestly can't get over how poorly it fits."
2,not cool,"The new version of this shade fits poorly. The ""ears"" that cover the little side windows make it very difficult to install, remove and roll up. Not a good design. Look at an accordian type for the best fit."
2,It's cumbersome,"So for the price, I expected something less cumbersome. Do not purchase this if you cannot spare the room in your car for this thing to be a passenger in- it's huge, does not roll up easily, it's stiff and all-around does not invite me to use it...which is not the point of this product."
4,So interesting it's worth a novel.,"When I saw the book Clipperton in the display window of a New York book store I had already been planning to write a novel about this strange island. With the additional information the book provided my plans became more concrete then. After a decade and many many rejection letters I finally found a publisher in Harbor House, Augusta, Georgia. The novel will be published in the fall of 2006. Thanks to Jimmy Skaggs; his book is interesting and well documented. A find for island lovers.Karl Berger M. D."
2,Slow down there....,"I don't know who generated the previous reviews but, if and when it shoots, you got a 50/50 chance of hitting your target. On one shot, two BB's came out? They were anything but accurate.Be aware the BB's tend to bounce so wear eye protection. This gun, IMHO, ain't that great. Look elsewhere."
5,Hoax? I dont think so,"I believe that Berkwoitz is really a born again christian. He may have been baptized before the killings but he was not born again. Being born again is something that happens in your heart. If he really was pretending im sure he would have taken parole but he said he deserves to be in jail for what he has done, isnt that proof enought that he he is sincere?"
4,Son Of Sam to the Son Of Hope!!!???,"There is only one way for anyone to crawl up inside the mind of another, and that MUST come from the horses mouth, so to speak, and that's all we've tried to do here. .. in his own words and thougts.The book has not been written yet (!) that knows or understands the mind of David Berkowitz. Like all he does NOW is to project a new image that has respectable Ministries vying his attention> He is frighteing!!! aside from being a great actor. I have sixteen years of him in my mind, and don't know ow to get it out???"
1,Hey Stephen,I wont buy your book! Are you floating in money now? He didnt fool anyone. The Christian grows over time. Good Try though. :)
4,"Our most used bib, period.",We've been using this on our boy since he was 5 months old. Couple of features - waterproof back that prevent wetness going to clothes. The pocket in the front was useful in holding major spills.One thing I'd like to see straps on the side. Our son sees the bib flapping around and starts yanking it. Straps on the side would secure it so that he does not see it.Other than that - completely satisfied.
5,Great product but expensive here.,$6.49 at TRU and $6+ at Walmart for 32 Large disposable bibs. The bib itself is quite large and stays put. Too much liquid will leak at the bottom.
3,Watch the COUNT!,"Don't buy these in a 32 count box! My order through Amazon with this vendor ended up being about $0.51 each; Most boxes are a pack of 4 (128 total), which comes to $0.21 each. Plus they're charging 2nd day shipping of $9.99. I got taken... don't let it happen to you."
4,Farberware Classic 12-Inch Fry Pan with Lid and Helper Handle,Great quality and good price on Amazon! Large surface are for when you are frying a larger quantity at one time. It is a little heavy since it is larger. Works great!
3,chip,"the short hold handle had a chip on it, i glued it inplace with hopes that it will stay in place"
1,Worse frying pan I ever bought,"If you like scrapping food out of the bottom of a frying pan then this is the one to buy! Adding oil or cooking sprays did not help, even bacon slices stick to this pan! I finally gave up and purchased a professional non stick frying pan and love it. This pan is going in my next garage sale!"
4,BEWARE -- this is a HUGE pan,"Farberware classic is great -- an inexpensive yet equally functional alternative to the very expensive pots & pans. Note: recently Farberware reduced its quality, in that older Farberware pots & pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell. The newer pots & pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom, but not encased within a stainless steel bottom. So, their quality is less than it was; most people who ""grew up with Farberware"" may not realize this. Farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base CURVE up the side of the pan -- they no longer do this, and are the same as many other manufacturers. Also note: if you are buying a 12"" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross-section. I found it to be so absolutely huge -- you could fry a dozen onions in this monster -- that I simply never use it. The 10"" and 8"" sizes may be what you're looking for!"
4,"Great Pan, love to fry...","This is a great pan for preparing meals. I generally have trouble with a pan being able to hold all of the ingredients, but this one is definitely up to the task. Although it's not stick-proof, most of my cooking involves sauces or olive oil (usually both), resulting in relatively easy cleanup. Keep in mind that it's very heavy (12 inces of stainless steel), but it doesn't warp, tip over, or get knocked off the counter."
5,Lovin' it!,"I was nervous about buying a skillet that was not non-stick, but it was a GREAT decision, and I'll never go back. I am impressed by how the product evenly distributes heat so that there's no worry about your food being unevenly cooked. I also find that the food tastes much better. In sum, I want to marry this skillet."
5,"giant fry pan with lid, not too heavy","I looked quite a while to find a large frying pan that was NOT non-stick. Some were extremely expensive, some had no lids, some were way too heavy, or the handles were awkward to hold. I wanted a lid! This pan is great. It is a bit heavy, but has the helper handle, so I can lift it full of food even though I'm rather weak. The main handle is comfortable. The pan cooks fine as far as what I need. I can cook a lot of vegetables or chicken at a time using oil. If bits remains stuck after cooking, I let the pan soak in water for a while and clean it with soap and a plastic scrubby. I store it hanging by the main handle on a hook, with the helper handle resting on another support hook below. I've had it several years now with no problems, using it about once a month."
5,AWESOME FRY PAN,"I have my original set of Farberware Classic pots & pans when I got married 36 yrs. ago. It did not include the 12"" fry pan which I wanted. It's a sturdy pan and cleans up easily. The BEST feature is the helper handle. This handle makes taking the pan from cooktop to table sooooo much easier, since a large pan as this can get very heavy when filled.A GREAT FRY PAN AT A GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not Inclusive; doesn't give over all picture of US HORSE CAVALRY,"MY LATE FATHER WAS A MEDICAL DOCTOR IN THE 9TH CAVALRY REGIMENT, SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION. THERE WASN'T MUCH SAID ABOUT THE 2ND CAVALRY DIVISION. PERHAPS COLONELTRUSCOTT DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE 2ND CAV DIVISION WAS THE LAST HORSE CAVALRY IN THE US ARMY. THEY WERE PROUD MEN WHO REALIZED THAT THEY WERE THE LAST LINK TO THE WILD WEST. BRACKETTVILLE AND FORT CLARK WERE A REMOTE POST AND LOCATION. MY FATHER LEARNED TO RIDE A HORSE AT FORT CLARK. THE MEN HAD FUN IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE 2ND CAV DIV NEVER SAW COMBAT; LET ME CORRECT THIS...ELEMENTS OF THE 2ND CAVALRY DIVISION FERRIED MEN AND EQUIPMENT IN BURMA AND CHINA VIA HORSE AND MULE. THEY DID FIGHT THE JAPANESE. GIVE THESE PROUD MEN THE CREDIT THEY ARE LONG OVERDUE TO GET."
4,Hero,Instructs on the role of heroes as a driving force in society. Worth while for those interested in the big picture of human events.
4,Lost all the balls,"My 16 months old daughter absolutely loved this toy. But we had the same problem as the next reviewer. My daughter lost all the balls that came with this toy in two months. She loved this toy so much that even now she gets the toy out, and pounds the remaining plastic case with the big hammer.If you are ordering this toy, keep an eye on the colored balls. As for me, I am ordering a new one."
2,Catch with this product,"There are two catches you need to be aware of with this product. First, the map is City Navigator 2008, which was produced somewhere mid 2007, it is not up to date and produces some funky auto routes. No problem, if you navigate through Garmin's difficult web, you can get a 2009 update free within a week or so. The second catch is that both the old and the new updated maps are City Navigator, intended for the older GPS models, and not City Navigator NT which is the latest compressed software. The maps are the same, but use a lot more memory."
3,Amazon Great Garmin tough,"Ordered Garmin Automotive Nav Pack - Amazon process, billing, shipping went great. Problem arose when I tried to use the online unlock process from Garmin to download the CD into my laptop. I could not get the unlock code on line so I phoned Garmin three times and was told I would have to wait on the phone for thirty minutes. Finally I got through to Garmin on the phone and was told yes they were having problems with the online process. They gave me a ""long"" code which worked fine. Security is important but Garmin made the unlocking process a real chore. Why not include the ""long"" code with the product in the box? Mike T."
2,Nice Shots,"I bought this DVD thinking it had a subject. Unfortunately it turned out to be a disappoinment. Nice shots of Miho Nomoto and Rebeca Chang are to view. No action, only nice poses of both."
2,Intimate Desires,"THis DVD is full of these two young models mostly naked. I thought this was a movie, but it isn't. This DVD is a collection of video/photo session with the two models interspliced with scenese from another DVD. I believe one of the other DVDs is called ""Lady in Heat,"" which should be a collection of 3 vignettes. All we get is a series of poses, none of which lasts more than 8 seconds, and a few scenes of kissing. I don't mind the tameness of these two beautiful girls together (there is nothing hardcore here), but I do mind the leftover, hash job the producers of this video have offered us."
4,a little different for Francis,"The train ride in Canada, a nice different setting, with the same mystery as most of his novels. Definately worth a read"
3,Well constructed detective story,"I found this a slow read, but worthwhile or I would have given it up.The details in the book are very complete, so that you almost feel that you are on the train with the detective.Somehow the punishment of the villain seems to be less than the crimeinvolved deserved? The description of how the detective makeshimself blend with the background in an unremarkable way is very good as well. I enjoyed the book, but not enough to give it high marks."
4,"Great Plot, Great Mystery","I forget how good Dick Francis mystery's are. This was a great plot. Tor Kelsey works for the British Jockey Club and is asked to take a Transcontinental Canadian Train from Toronto to Vancouver with a bunch of horses, their owners, their grooms and a mystery tour. Disguised as a waiter, Kelsey is watching a villain the Club has been trying to catch for years. Julious Appollo Filmer is suspected of murder but it was never proven. So Kelsey is trying to catch him in an act of law breaking so he can be banished from racing forever. What he doesn't know is, he will actually enjoy the ride himself, even if he is a lowly waiter. I was given a Dick Francis book by my Aunt because she knew I liked horses. And yes, Francis's books are loaded with information on horses. But the mystery in these books are some of the best. It's been a while since I have engaged in a Dick Francis mystery. After reading this, it has me anxious to get lost in another."
5,A great resource for study,"I've found this software VERY useful for Bible study. Being able to search for words (or a brief sequence of letters), whether in English, Hebrew or Greek, saves a lot of time. The lexicon and Strong's numbering is handy for translating and parsing. I'd recommend this for any college student, Minister or preacher... and I know I've only dipped into the ""shallow end"" of the tools it has available. Do read the small print for what's included / not included - but it's VERY worthwhile."
5,by far the best free bible software!,"Online Bible is by far the best bible software I found. It is extremely flexible, as it allows the user to incorporate his own materials, books etc. Apart from my bible hardcopy its the tool I use most for preparing bible studies. Just try it..."
4,Fairly good story line,"This is a fairly good story about an English Duke and his 6 year old daughter who comes to the U.S. to visit his brother. (Sequal to ""A Cowboy at Heart"") His mother tells everyone that he is searching for a wife. This causes a lot of problems. He hooks up with Sydney, a young woman trucker. Because of his unhappy first marriage, he refuses to accept that he loves Sydney, but with the help of his daughter, mother and brother, everything turns out well. There is one part of the story where Sydney is being hasseled by another driver on the C.B. I was dissatisfied with the way this was handled, but all in all it is a cute story and a quick read."
2,Best when used by date,"I have enjoyed Zatarain's products and, therefore ordered a number of boxes of dirty rice and cheese via Amazon's Subscribe and Save process. My problem is the items received expire in like 108 days (12 boxes). I have purchased items at local stores and the best by date are almost always at least year in advance. This shipment appears to be at the very tail end of the cycle - the items are clumpy and appear to have been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time (obviously). Ok gotta run and eat some before the expiration date!"
1,WTF ???,"Video only?Absolutely no sound from this ""NTSC"" DVD.I tried it on multiple machines and several computers...No dice...the soundtrack is absent.You have an ideal picture of the artists performing their very silent show.Not very satisfying...I'd rather hear and not see a band than see and not hear a band.just a bit pissed in Puyallup, WA"
3,Average novel about revenge and redemption,"I wanted to like Peter Abrahams's ""Light's Out"", but I just couldn't. Eddie Nye is almost likeable, as a newly released prisoner, who served 15 years for a crime he didn't committ. We slowly learn how he got himself into that mess, and we learn that things are not as they seem, with Eddie's brother, for instince. The subplot about Nye trying to figure out about ""Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner"" is interesting, but doesn't compensate for the weak ending."
3,Disappointing ending to well-written book,"My first Peter Abrahams book. Liked the writing and the premise. The ending is improbable and unsatisfying, however. I'm in the middle of Abrahams' Oblivion, which is beautifully written. I'll keep reading him."
4,Fascinating Read,"This was an interesting and fascinating book. This guy is a very good writer, and weaves a great story while bobbing back and forth in time. Would definitely recommend."
5,Riveting Story,"Eddie Nye has been sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit - he thinks he knows who's responsible, and is determined to find the man when he's released after 15 years. Eddie has changed - a once top-flight swimmer destined for college, he's become a hardened, vicious fighter who's not easily intimidated. Once out, he savors his freedom - then realizes he's still not safe from former prison acquaintances. The novel traces his odyssey from prison to New England to the Caribbean island where his problems began. This is a real page-turner. Some might not like the ending, but to me it seemed almost poetic in its perfect rounding off of the story."
4,Purchased for Class,"I purchased this item new for a class I am in. I have only read a small amount as of yet, but it seems to be a well written text. The book came very quickly after my purchase."
5,Happy days,A teenage fantasy for sure. I would go to more class reunions if they were like this.A fun movie.
3,Peggy Sue Gets Married,"I am not a huge fan of Francis Ford Coppola nor Nicholas Cage or Kathleen Turner or Helen Hunt but I found the movie worth watching and sad at times especially touching,I like how she meets all her relatives from the past that have passed on sadly,and the different era it goes back to it,although I hate when the Mom says she will vote ""democrat""(Huge mistake)and that annoying Kerouac Quoting beatnik hippy kid. And Nicholas Cage's Annoying voice for the Part,but the movie is not Bad Overall a trip back in time to simpler time for most and those who did not have the chance to witness those times."
4,yes sir,peggy sue is a great movie it came right away and was brand new just like it said I didn't pay that much for it either which it the great thing about it
5,funny and very sad,"I feel this movie is very funny and all actors did a great job all those years ago. It's really is funny, BUT has some very sad moments. Going back for a second chance at things and or reliving parts of your life, seeing and interacting with people you have since lost... well, that would be kind of emotional. Great movie in my book."
5,classic,I loved this blast from the past. Nicholas Cage is great in this movie and I watched it twice in a row. Great for something to do.
1,The movie doesn't play,"The movie will not play. I tried it in two different DVD players and the movie won't play at all. ""Peggy Sue Got Married"""
4,underrated movie,"Would you make different decisions in your life given the opportunity? This questions forms the basis of a very original screenplay, along with a good dose of touching and humorous nostalgia. Not sure why it was not a hit. But then again, good story does not usually equate to box office success!"
1,Another Amazon product misrepresentation,"Amazon's product descriptive information for this movie DVD includes a ""Review"" stating ""the DVD release has optional full-screen and widescreen presentations....(etc.)......."". This is NOT TRUE. Amazon sent me the DVD copy of this movie and it DOES NOT offer a presentation of this movie in its original Widescreen format. It is ""Full Screen"" ONLY. It shows only part of the original movie. DO NOT buy this mis-represented product (unless you WISH to be duped, OR unless you just CAN'T do without ""PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED"" no matter HOW Amazon wants to dump it on you). I've requested a refund for a falsely represented product."
5,Cobalt drills rule!,"I know Cobalt (both M-35 and M-42) are way more expensive than regular HSS drills, but if you've got exotic metals or steel to drill it's like night and day. I wouldn't go back to HSS except for wood and maybe aluminum after this!"
1,"The drills are worthless, but the packaging is cute","I'd love to be in a position to recommend what to buy instead of these, but I don't have a clue. I've always sworn by Irwin bits. I bought my current cobalt set about 4 years ago and they are still going strong. So I thought I was doing my son a favor when I bought him this set. That is until we dulled two bits trying to extract a broken bolt last weekend. Perhaps the bolt was made out of a new, super-hard steel? Nope. I used a bit from my set, and it went through the bolt like butter. The quality may have gone south, but the packaging on his set is oh-so-cute. Someone at Irwin surely got a bonus for making that trade-off."
1,Did not want to use again,The smell was overwhelming and the color on the product was coming off after one use. I threw it away and felt like a made a mistake purchasing it. I should have listened to the other reviews.
5,WIFE JUST LOVES IT........,"Bought this for my wife on her 40th as a surprise,i did some looking around and found this one.it is big and thick,my wife loves the vibration on it,she says this is the best one she has ever had.As far as getting it in you do have to work it in,problem was solved with lubrication.It does have a smell to it which might put some people off,but other than that great toy and the vibrations are out of this world according to my wife."
3,not bad,"I like the gentle, quiet vibe. Not as large as I thought it would be but it does the job. It does have a weird plastic smell to it. I have been washing it with a gentle cleanser and water and the smell has been getting less. I would definitely buy this product again!"
4,Good Not Great,"Easy to enjoy because Mckeown has such a wonderful voice, but when the album is finished it's less than fulfiling."
4,The Ugly Duckling And The Con Man,"I recently rewatched FUNNY GIRL for the first time in perhaps twenty years. And though I still think it is a fine film I was not as charmed by it as I was in my earlier days. Maybe I've read too much about the real Fanny Brice and Nick Arnstein and found out how very sanitized Arnstein's life story was for the Broadway musical and this film that is quite closely adapted from it. For whatever reason I did not find Omar Sharif's portrayal of the handsome gambler Nick as breathtaking in this viewing and I actually found his accent annoying. At any rate the film is still a must see for musical lovers and those like me with an interest in entertainment history though the viewer should be very aware of the great deal of license taken in retelling this bittersweet love story. And Streisand of course was young and at her full powers in her star making role as Fanny that still seems positively tailor made for her voice, looks and screen presence."
4,Funny Girl 1968,"One of the most populare movie musicals ever made , FUNNY GIRL follows the early career of stage comedienne Fanny Brice (1891-1951) a role that earned Barbra Streisand (1942- ) the 1968 Oscar for best actress . As the film opens only her mother believes Fanny can make it in show business . When she gets her first break at Keeneys Music Hall , her hilarious debut as a roller-skating chorus girl gets her hired as a comededienne .A year later Fanny is working for Florenz Ziegfeldt (1867-1932) in his famous Follies and brings the house down with an outrageos and unplananeed number . Fanny becomes a star, and marries Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif 1932- ) , a handsome gambler whose luck doesnt hold up . The film many memorable songs include ""Dont rain on my parade"" and the streisand classic ""People"" . Digitaly remastred Audi & Anamorphic Video , Super Sound and Picture . Recommended"
5,Impressed,"I just bought the DVD last month and I am very impressed. I've had both VHS and laserdisc versions of this film for some time, but the vibrance of the color and the quality of the sound has never been better. Definitely one of the better DVD transfers out there. Well worth the money! Go Babs!"
5,Don't Let Today's Barbra Stop You From Watching Yesterday's,"To those Celine Dion fans who don't understand why she will never quite equal Streisand in the eyes of many of Barbra's fans, I present exhibit A: Funny Girl. I was 15 years old when I first saw this film and fell in love with Barbra. She simply wowed me. Bounced off the screen with her presence. And that voice! Just an extraordinary talent. Yes, she's become a bit out of control and beyond full of herself as the years have gone by. I can't sit through Mirror Has To Faces and some of her later films. But show me Funny Girl (or The Way We Were) and I'm that 15 year old again who fell in love with ""The Greatest Star."" If you have never seen this movie before, don't let biases that you might have formed against Streisand in recent years stop you. It is really, truly a must-see. She more than deserved that Oscar! (Something I guess Celine still has on her To-Do List.)"
4,Funny Girl,We liked the movie even though it had a very sad ending.Barbara is a great singer.It has some very funny parts
5,Classic,"One of my all-time favorites.I would love to see this,as well as Funny Lady on blu-ray.I can't wait! Hopefully it will be soon!"
5,The Last Best Star Plays One of the First,"How appropriate that Streisand brought this role to us. She appeared on the scene just after the end of the great musicals and great musical stars, so it is no surprise that she is our connection to those movies and that time. Her performance as Fanny Brice, though lacking much connection to the reality of Brice's style or life, also bridges the gap between old time and new style musicals. The emotional, idealized treatment of the material suited her talents perfectly. In my opinion, Streisand's closing number in this film, ""My Man,"" is what clinched her Best Actress Oscar. Also in my opinion, it is one of the three most electrifying moments ever caught on film. (Judy Garland's ""The Man that Got Away"" from ""A Star is Born"" being the second. I'm still deciding on the third ...)"
1,Disappoointed,"This product is defective. The opening credits and begining of the movie are BLANK. Video and sound kicks in 10 minutes after the start of the movie. This is the THIRD DVD of this movie I've purchased, all of which were defective in this manner. So what is the problem? It's time for Amazon to check into this. Up until now everything I've purchased either directly from Amazon, or from an Amazon supplier has been great."
5,"""People who see FUNNY GIRL, are the luckiest people . . .""",""". . . in the world!""Back in '68 that's how the tagline for FUNNY GIRL read, taking it's insiration from Streisand's signature tune. For once, the line that was only meant to sell tickets was actually telling the truth.I've seen this film nearly 100, and evey time it never fails to humor me, touch me, and inpire me. I will never be able to describe what this film means to me."
5,Great gift,I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She loves this movie! She used to look up the songs on YouTube and sing them and now she doesn't have to!
5,amazing debut,Barbra is wonderful in her first movie. She and Fanny Brice have a lot in common and Streisand did a wonderful job.
2,Second Half Of The Movie Is Almost Unwatchable,"Barabara is so charming and funny in the first part of the film. But, the second half loses all its steam; I felt like there was no story after their marriage started falling apart...you're kind of waiting for it to end at that point. Furthermore, Omar Sharif was not particularly well-casted in my opinion."
3,MUST SEE - Once,"This used to be one of my favorite movies. The songs are spectacular, and the telling of Fanny Brice's rise to stardom is a lot of fun. Once she has it all, the movie tends to drag. It's an interesting perspective on how we might look at life, however - it's the struggle to get somewhere that most intrigues us. Once we get there, it's no fun anymore. That's why this is a must see once movie - and you will want a CD of the music."
4,"Good memory, Great Price","Received my RAM in 3 days, excellent service. Good memory for the price. Do not notice any speed difference between high priced RAM.....Highly recommend"
5,Tanya Michaels is at the top of her game with...,"...Not Quite as Advertised.Jocelyn McBride hates coming in second...especially coming in second to Hugh Brannon, an ex-lover and current nemesis. But the more she's around Hugh, the more she discovers a man who makes her laugh...who makes her discover something that's been missing in her life. Could it be love, like Hugh claims?Tanya Michael shines in this romantic comedy!"
3,Just Okay,"After reading one Tanya Michaels book (Hers for the Weekend) which became a favorite, I was eager to read some of her other titles. This one was highly recommended, so I decided to give it a try. While it was enjoyable to a certain extent, it just didn't do it for me, hence the 3 stars. I will read other books by her, though."
2,Too Much Rap,"I thought this CD package would be a good value for my money. I couldn't pass up 100 Christian songs for my little baby! However, upon listening to the CD's, I have realized that I would have been better off getting a CD with fewer songs. In order to scrounge up 100 Christian songs, they have included traditional hymns that have been ruined by setting them to a rap-style beat. My toddler has no taste in rap music yet, and neither do I. It wouldn't have been so bad if they had lumped all the rap songs together on one CD which I could then ignore, but each CD includes some of these offending songs. It really ruined the whole set for me and six months later I realize I haven't listened to those CD's since the first month I purchased them. Therefore, I am offering this product review to warn off other parents who may not like rap music mixed in with Christian songs for their children."
5,"Great--but, unfortunately, largely overlooked--work.","Perhaps the fact that this great work receives so little attention is indicative of what ails education: educators focus their attention on all the latest drivel concerning education while only paying lip service to Dewey, who remains the highest-ranking educational philosopher. It pains me to hear and read bungling educators mindlessly parrot Dewey's catch phrases (e.g., ""learning by doing"") while pushing educational doctrines completely antithetical to Dewey's ideas. Dewey had it right, but is grossly misunderstood by the bozos who vapidly regurgitate his words and phrases. In other words, I recommend that you go to the source.If you are in any way concerned with or interested in education and happen to stumble upon this lonely page, do yourself, your kids, and/or your students a favor and study this book carefully; It eclipses all other books on education."
1,Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education,"This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes, not even at the bottom of the page. You will notice that this book is only 194 pages, whereas I recently found a very good used copy that is 378 pages. Both are unabridged, but in this edition the text is crammed onto the pages. Also, just scanning through the book today I quickly found two typos. Avoid this cheaply constructed edition. I sincerely hope Amazon stops selling it."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS EDITITION, OVERPRICED/POOR QUALITY","Hello all.First off, this work is an important work of Dewey, someone I deeply respect; HOWEVER....Whatever you do, do not buy this hardcover edition of Democracy and Education. It is a cheap ebook / online edition of the book in a cheap hardcover binding. The text literally looks like it was printed off of a website. The font is horrible, the text is small, and there is no space between the lines. It is honestly disgusting to look at especially for the price of nearly 30 dollars. Buy another edition or a paperback copy if you really want to feel like you have a REAL book."
2,"Monumentally important book, terrible version","Clearly, this is one of the most important books in the realm of education. This edition, however, is simply a bound set of photocopies from an earlier edition THAT WAS MARKED UP! I figured there would be some imperfections, but this is worse than borrowing a handed-down used copy."
2,Great Book Horrible Print,"This print has many pages in which the first letter(s) or last letter(s) are missing from the page. It also has the sloppy markings of a previous reader as part of the reprint. I did verified this was not a used copy by comparing the notes on the pages with a fellow student, and it is part of the book. I recomend this book, just buy a print from a different source/company. There are many prints, I beleive many other students had a simple looking version with a plain white cover."
1,Don't buy this version!!!,This edition of the book is unreadable. Don't buy it. The font is about a 9 or maybe smaller. You would really hurt your eyes trying to get through this book.
2,don't buy this edition,"hey, Dewey is obviously great. But dont buy this edition. it is poorly laid out and has misspellings in a few places."
3,Good... but tough reading!,"As an Education major at Macon State College, I read this book for my Education 2403 class. Despite my problems with this book, I have to say, that Dewey was WAY ahead of his time, in my opinion! Most of his theories are relevant today, and as such, I can only imagine the reaction he received in the early 1900's. Unfortunately, this book is not easy to read. It feels much too technical in both language and philosophy. For a student just entering an Educational major program, I think it would be great! However, at this stage, the theories were repetitious to me. I had difficulty remaining focused as I read it. One point to emphasize: we Never stop learning! I hope that I can incorporate each of the many theories as I continue my own education."
1,Had to buy it,I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring. I was happy with the price and that's about it.
4,A must read for anyone in the education field,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I understand all of the goals Dewey envisioned. He was a brilliant man. I strongly recommend that you read this book first and then read Left Back by Diane Ravitch to learn how and why the progressive movement failed."
5,Saddest Story Ever,What can you say about this novel? The story of Jude's expectations and the downfall of his family is overwhelmingly tragic. I bought this novel for my teenager--hoping she'd appreciate how good she has it.
5,The book to start reading Hardy.,"I remember this book -one of my 5 favourite- specially for the impact that made on me when I read it back in college. If you read first other books by Hardy you may think this one is a little sentimental and ""soap-operistic"". But this is trully a gem, a work of art.I felt identified with the hero and I could sense the things and places that show in the whole book. It is so real, and the feelings are so real and strong that you suffer with the characters.Trully a masterpiece. You must read it."
5,Agony of Moral Decisions,"This book is about the struggle of having character. As such, it addresses perhaps a timeless question: should we follow our hearts and do what we want or should we follow convention and do what we think is demanded?Although they try desperately, and for a time succeed, Jude and Sue never fully escape the demands of conscious, obligation, and social convention. And it destroys them. Jude and Sue thus personify the agonizing struggle to make moral decisions. If we knew right from wrong, we would choose right every time. But, what makes Jude and Sue's struggles so painful is that they are trying to choose between right and right, or wrong and wrong. Either decision provides as much pain, although in a different way. So what do you do?Hardy doesn't give any easy answers. But, especially today when most of us all the time do exactly what we want, perhaps the question is worth thinking seriously about."
4,Jude.....,"Thomas Hardy... I wonder what his life must have been like in order for him to write such a tragic book. For those considering it, this book is a romantic tragedy of the highest degree. If your looking for a happily ever after, look elsewhere. But if your looking to run the gamut of human experience in books, this is one you will want to take up, I've never read a book that has taken such a sentimental turn for the worse than this. I hope this helps."
4,"A very well written, sad and sometimes irritating story.","This is a sad book! Going through it, you can't help but feel sorry for Jude. He tries so hard and seems to fail at everything he's ever wanted. He's never really had any adult role models when he was growing up. This has made him vulnerable to the ploys of people like Arabella who tricks him into marriage twice. As for Sue, although he considers her the love of his life, you cannot help but wonder how she truely feels about him.All the females in this book are so flawed in so many ways. Arabella is the master manipulator as for Sue, she has some quite peculiar theories and ideas. Sometimes it makes them irritating.It's pretty sad and almost heartbreaking to see this man give up so much of himself for his love and to suffer so much for it."
5,Fate,"It seems to me, after reading a couple of Thomas Hardy novels, that although Hardy's stories are rich in narrative, they're working on a more abtract level or meant to convey more universal themes. My impression is that the point of the novel is made in the very title of the book. One doesn't have to consider this story in the context of the 19th century. The same set of circumstances could have occurred in any century. Jude was living his life according to his own values; outside forces played upon his choices, and the results were unfortunately, unhappy for Jude. I guess in today's competitive world where people believe they control every turn of their destiny, it may seem the outcomes in this novel should have been different. But, look again. You'll simply find a man living his life the best way he knows how to."
5,A compelling and excellent novel of human nature,"The issues of marriage, children, passions and revelations of the ordinary dominate this detailed and gripping novel.Hardy's tragic novel leads the reader along the lives of the main character, Jude, and his lover, Sue so well that it's a small wonder that this book hadn't been made into a feature film before this year. This is a book of longing for dreams, but finding only stark reality again and again. Though this point may not be a happy one, Hardy's concern for his characters and their settings make this book impossible for the reader to set down for any length of time. A must read."
3,Tragically unrealistic,"I read Jude as a challenge. I couldn't relate to the characters at all. Except maybe Arabella. Jude and Sue were tremendously sad characters. Jude was obviously an intellegent man, but idiotic in his view of Sue. Sue was a sorceress, contented only when messing up other people's lives and leaving them broken-hearted. Though very well-written and to some extent heartfelt, Jude to me was a classic with poor morals and suicidal mortals."
5,Jude the Obscure,"The book is new and arrived sooner that I expected.Thank you for include a book mark. Everytime I buy something here, Im so happy. Thank you!"
4,Obscure is an understatement,"I very much enjoyed the beginning of the novel. However, toward the end, things became a little too dark. I'd been warned that it was Hardy's darkest, but was still unprepared for the plot twists.Hardy's word choice, foreshadowing, and imagery were very entertaining, but the plot was unenjoyable towards the end. Character motivation also was rather abstract. I had to read this book for my Eng102H class, and if I had picked it out for pleasure reading, I would not have finished it. It was obscure to say the very least."
1,lazy publisher,"The edition of ""Jude the Obscure"" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback, with the two horses on the cover -- first came out in '61 and hasn't been touched since then (except to add a bibliography in 1980). There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published."
4,Much to offer,"Thomas Hardy has much to offer the reader in this, his final novel before he committed himself full-time to poetry. It caused a storm of controversy when it was first published before the end of the 19th century. With its frank (but not graphic) descriptions of sexuality and its emphasis on the fact that only the two people involved need to consent to a relationship--not their priest or minister, not their families, and certainly not society as a whole--""Jude"" shocked the public. It stands now as a beautifully sustained character study of a broken man and his steadfast love for the unsure Sue. Jude is a rock and it is fitting that he makes his living carving stone. Sue is birdlike, dainty, emotionally unstable and absolute catnip to Jude. Beyond this, they are distantly related and that adds a certain fillip to their interactions. The impatient reader will have difficulty understanding Jude's unwavering devotion, but it is evidence of Hardy's skill that he makes Jude make sense."
3,Jude the Obscure - ebook,"Spend the whole book feeling sorry for Jude, if that was the goal of the author fine, but never really got to the point that I could recommend this to others, sorry. Just left me flat."
3,So depressing,"If you fell that you are so happy and you are looking for something to put you in depression, this novel will be a good choice. It is about a guy (Jude) full of ambitions since his childhood and the through the pages, you will read that he lose them one by one. I don't know why I kept reading it to the last page, maybe it was some commitment as I purchased the book. I read the novel after that I couldn't understand totally some events occurred in the last edition of movie for the novel. I am looking now for a comedy novel to relief me from pain of depression caused by this story."
3,Too Sad,"The book started out good. I liked Jude and had hope for Jude, but everything came apart and continued to get worse. I was crushed by the end. Not something to read for encouragement."
4,You'll age while reading this...,"But oooooh it's good! _Jude_ is really long, and not an easy read (keep your dictionary handy). I'm glad I read it as part of a class. Hardy has plenty of time to craft his characters in this book, and they are crafty indeed. I have never felt such strong emotions towards a literary character. By the time _Jude_ was over, I hated ""her"" SO MUCH...but you'll have to read it to know who this ""her"" is. Good luck, and don't get discouraged, it's worth it."
2,"unreadable, text is all centered",This is free but also impossible to read the way it is formatted. The first few pages (that was as far as i got) were all centered text and I assume the rest of the book is like that too. It is very distracting and for me it is unreadable. Off to find a different version...
1,"Fine Story, Low Quality eBook","The digi reads edition doesn't even have a table of contents making it completely useless in the classroom. There is no way to navigate by book sections, chapters or anything of the like. If you are reading straight through for fun, this might be fine, but if you are reading critically and need to quickly navigate sections it's pretty much impossible."
1,Blah,Not a great book. A required reading for a class and I could barely keep on reading it. Good luck.
3,"Jude, your name is frailty.","Perhaps this review is a tad unfair in that I haven't finished reading the book yet. That said, I am determined to do so. The character of Jude is a ""weak"" one. Sue is almost anachronistically a hippie. The school master is dull and insignificant. Sue is about to be married but to what end? To tease Jude or to wreck the teacher?"
2,"""Jude"": little to appreciate","As a Hardy fan, I turned to ""Jude"" with high expectations--and was very disappointed. I saw in his work the same recylcing of elements in other works (particularly ""Tess"" and ""Return of the Native""). If Hardy wanted to come out and condemn religion, he should have done so, instead of his little forays and hasty retreats. So read ""Jude"" if you must, but to see Hardy at his best I recommend ""Mayor of Castorbridge"" instead."
4,"Please 2, 3 stars what is it that you like about TROOP?","Well 1st off if u like Jodeci u will like this cd. It most definitely has that feel and they keep the TROOP sound. Don't know what they were listening to when they rated the CD so low. The cd was on Hammer's Bust it Records label. The 1st six songs are slow, track 4 has the ""What About Us"" feel. The last 5 are mid tempo and they are decent, guess they wanted the album to be DEEPA but DEEPA type songs were on the DEEPA album. So I encourage you to buy the album if you're a TROOP fan or not, you won't be disappointed."
3,Their weakest CD,Troop follwed up thier excellent Deepa CD with this weaker CD. Three of the oringial members left and they gained Demetirus Shipp who produced 95 % of the CD. The first half of the CD are the ballads which are all pretty strong in partiuclar Let's Get Warm which is soon to be one of my mix CD favorites. All in all I guess this CD proves that a group is the strongest with all members. Be on the lookout for a new CD in 2005.
3,"Rhythm, no blues","This new sound (sortof) suits Palmer's formula of sexy lyrics with sexy rhythms. It sounds great, but sometimes his lyrics leave me flat. I guess I've heard him say too many times, ""You're a masterpiece"" so that it sounds stale. Half the album, though, is exceptional listening, including his remake of ""Let's get it on"" and remakes of two of his earlier works. The ending song is a wistful little ditty that doesn't really fit with the rest of the songs, but the album is better off for it. This album does have sexy rhythm, but its lacking a little heart."
3,like,Bought this album for one song(TRUE LOVE)and it is the best song he ever did !I would like to get the video also .
2,More Blues than Rhythm,"I've been a Robert Palmer fan for several years now and I have all of his albums. I hate to hear anything bad about his music but I find this album a bit of a let down, especially after waiting such a long time for it's release. The tracks are too keyboard orientated and this spoils it for me. The single 'True love' is exceptional as is the wonderful 'Stone Cold'(with it's great vocal arrangements). The album showcases Palmer's splendid vocal, however the songs just don't cut it. Take my advice, buy 'Honey' or 'Heavy Nova' instead."
3,Palmer proves he hasn't lost his touch...,"I've always been a fan of Robert Palmer since I heard ""Some Like It Hot."" I didn't realize he had a new album until I spotted it at a local store. Being the skeptic I am, I checked out some realaudio clips and I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard...The first track, ""True Love"", is just plain awesome. The rest of the disc is quite good, although a few of the tracks seem a bit bland as they don't stand out like ""True Love"" does.All in all, I am very happy with this disc. If you are a fan of Robert Palmer's past work, you'll probably like what you hear. As I said before, Robert proves that he can change with the times and certainly hasn't lost his touch."
1,Palmer blew it BIG STYLE!,Throughout the 80's Robert Palmer released some great albums and thus built himself a reputation for high levels of musicianship and an air of suave sophistication. But if you ask me on this album Palmer blew it big style. The problem is he has taken on too much himself playing most of the instruments himself and masterminding the production. As David Lloyd so rightly says in his review the album has too much keyboard on it and ends up sounding to clean and clynical even on the more soulful tracks. The whole album left me 'Stone Cold.'
1,A Wretched Production,"This reprint is so ugly in its typography and layout that I sent it back and bought a used copy of the 1970 edition. The reprint is smaller than the original, and to compensate, the publishers have not only cut the margins down to almost nothing, but have compressed the text horizontally so that the character glyphs are unpleasantly out of proportion. Do not buy this edition unless you are completely indifferent to typography and graphic design."
2,Strap broke within a few uses!,"1st, the cups were a bit small, & I know I gave the right size. Then, the strap broke! It's pretty, & they had my size, which is a small miracle in itself, but I wouldn't buy this again!"
2,Frustrating,"I think the fit of the bra is great, but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable. The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides. I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric; didn't work. I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape, but I just can't."
4,surprised at how well it fit,"I've had this bra for a year now and am looking to order a replacement. I was very pleased with how well it fit my chest and the support it offered...especially after ordering online without having tried it on in a store. I agree with the poster that commented about the strap cushions not staying put and sliding around. At times the loose end of the strap will work its way out of the cup also and is annoying. My main complaint about this bra, however, is the metal clasp on the strap. It tends to dig into my right shoulder (which is my heavier side) and then the strap slips and falls off my shoulder at times. Maybe it digs in bc I have it adjusted too tightly for the weight it is supporting?? Overall though, it really is a good bra. Also 37 years old, it seems very old-ladyish, but gives me the support I haven't found in other bras my size (46H)"
3,Sturdy but old-fashioned shape,"I purchased this bra after reading many reviews. I will say a few things:1) Yes, very sturdy. Not stretchy at all which is a good thing.2) Fabric is scratchy and left me raw in spots. I found after a few washes this improved.3) I'm relatively young and it reminded me of a very old-fashioned shape bra. It seems to separate a bit too much and points slightly outward rather than straight forward.4) Nothing sexy about this bra... I actually feel unattractive and about 80yrs old when I look in the mirror. I'm only 37!5) Just really dislike the shape it's giving me.6) I agree with sizing... order up a tiny bit. I'm like a 38 band and the 40 was perfect. I tried to measure the cup size carefully but that wound up a bit big and had to re-order.7) For those of us who need larger sized cups at least it's an option but it could be a lot better!"
5,Classy,"It only holds a small volume of water, but it's classy and cute. I feel classy and cute while using it."
5,A real treat,"I first found these at the Park Hyatt Washington D.C.They still make me smile and feel like I am drinking in luxury with this think wonderful glasses. They are very clear and the right size. They have a flat bottom so if they sweat they stick to a glass table a little, but I just love them. I thought of getting the wine glasses for water/juice but these work better without hitting your nose and are easier to wash."
4,Excellent value,"This is a very good set. Heavy, even heating, nice looking, pretty easy to clean, and the set include most pieces you need for day to day. The 5-quart saute pan is really mega-huge and hard for a small woman such as myself to wield, but it works nicely for stovetop browning to oven finishing dishes. I am going to supplement the set with several nonstick pieces because you just can do delicate fish in these pans, it'll rip to shreds. My dad was over helping me cook and he said ""is that All-Clad"". I was like ""as if I could afford it""! Worth every penny and then some. As much as I've always yearned for the high end stuff, I don't think I would bother now that I know you can get so much for so little."
2,Poorly drawn animals and cumbersome design,"With some effort, these blocks do the job of producing animal sounds, but they look awkward, and there is little fun in playing with them.The animals are drawn poorly, in a sketchy style, and with strange proportions: for instance, the elephant looks as if it was fathered by a badger-dog. Even more annoying are large metal bolts protruding from all sides of the blocks. They are not shown on the picture, but they make the surface look uneven and ugly. These bolts need to be aligned precisely and touch the ones on the other block for it to make sounds. The kid is not rewarded with sounds for putting the blocks in the right position unless these bolts touch, which is not good for learning and makes it less fun.I am keeping these blocks because sending them back is not worth shipping charges, but otherwise I wouldn't buy them."
3,taste is better,i was one of the 1st to hear it as my uncle owns the reord company. i think that taste was the better
3,Could be a lot better,"There are a few things that stop this steamer from living up to its full potential. This is based on using it with a gas stove, some of these problems might not occur with an electric stove.1) The handles (both sets) get very hot, you can't pick up the pot or the steamer basket with bare hands.2) The handles are not heat resistant. More than once I've left the stove on high & the heat from the flames actually started to melt the handles. Seriously, it smelt like melting plastic & now the underside of the handles are rippled.3) It takes about 3 times longer for this pot to boil than previous steamers I've had, this is an indication of a thicker (higher quality) pot so it's not necessarily a bad thing, just something to keep in mind.4) The holes in the basket allow more things to fall through than most, this isn't a big issue unless you need to stir whatever you're steamer"
5,Best Steamer Ever,"It was a great addition to my set. I was tired of the other hard to clean steamer thing-a-ma-jigs, this cleans up wonderfully."
4,it is too small for big cook.,I like this pot but it is too small for big cooking. If you plan to have a big party don't buy it.
5,Replacement,"I bought this to replace an old Faberware steamer set that was showing its age. Works well, stacks and stores easy."
2,bad design,"The pan steams perfectly, however the design of the handles is bad. You HAVE to both, use two hands and use a pot holder or towel to grab the handles. This is because they get as hot as the pan. The same goes for the handles on the steamer...they get wicked hot. There is no insulation in the handles. Will never buy a pot with similar design again."
5,Love It,I really enjoy the 3-qt. steamer. It is the right size for me. It is attractive and I like the heavy weight. I recommend it.
1,Terrible!,"The steamer stack does not sit properly on the pot, and lets the steam out.Because of this it doesnt actually steam the food properly and eventually the water will run dry.Don't buy it."
4,Faberware...a staple in the home,"I was requested to purchase a new 3 quart Farberware pot for Christmas. Finding a pot with a perfect matched steamer was an added bonus. Our only minor complaint is that this pot uses a double grip handle vs. the single stem handle. If it could have been the single stem pot with double handled steamer I think we would use the base pot more. Regardless, for the price, warranty, and brand to match all our other pots, this purchase was an easy one to make."
5,If you're going to own only one pot. . .,"This is a set which I've purchased as a gift for many young people and couples starting out. It is great for steaming vegetables, with the insert, or any other cooking without it. Because it doesn't have a non-stick coating it will not deteriorate and you will own it as long as you wish. (Mine has a steamer insert which looks a little different, but I've had it for more than thirty years).While the insert isn't deep enough to use as a pull-out drainer of pasta, cooking pasta in the pot, and then using the steamer insert as a colander, in the sink, works quite well."
4,"Excellent for Induction, Quality is OK","Needed a universal pot for my Duxtop Induction burner. I knew this was rather small which is what I needed to feed one. I like to cook pasta and veggies. This works great as an all in one pot for that. As to quality, you get what you pay for. It seems study enough, but I can tell after a few uses that the inside bottom of the pot with discolor and wear quicker than a higher quality pot. For the money this is a great pot, just know you are not getting All Clad."
3,Hot Handles!,It does what it's supposed to do but the handles get too hot to touch. I have to use oven mitts just to lift the steaming basket. They should have used a different type of plastic IMO.
3,"Very finely made, but it is far too small. The picture on the website is misleading.","It is as refined as a Swiss watch and it feels very solid, but it is far too small. The picture on the website is misleading. It may be enough for a person living alone. If he or she has a family, forget this steamer pot."
2,Dissapointed with this saucepot,"I was so dissapointed when I receive this saucepot. So smaller. I do not know what I can do with this steamer. You can only steam one egg each time. It does not worth this price.Moreover, be careful of the handle. It will become very hot during cook."
5,Awesome!,"This steamer was exactly what I was looking for. It is the perfect size to steam two servings of vegetables perfectly. This is perfect for one or two people. I would say if you need to steam larger portions you will not be happy with this. I have also steamed fish in this as well. I use this at least three times a week. The pan is not tiny, neither is it big and bulky so it does not take up a lot of room in the cabinets. It does feel sturdy and feels like it has a good weight to it. I always hand wash this set as soon as I use it and it is very easy to clean. I love this set!"
2,not impressed,"It's described as ""stainless steel"", but brand new, the bottom had marks that looked like hard water stains. I managed to get them out with vinegar and water, but it has been picking up stains ever since, including fingerprints on the outside, which soap and water won't remove, more hard water stains, and heavy marks at the water line. The pot has always been hand washed and dried.Worse, the plastic handles melt and bubble, giving off that nauseating burning plastic smell. As a steamer, one would think it would be designed to withstand high heat. One handle came loose after a few uses. It is easily screwed back on, but I think it's just more evidence of shoddy workmanship.Overall this is a very cheap pot in feel and construction. Pot is made in China. Perhaps there are quality control issues, and I just got a bad one, though I am guessing the handles are the same on all of them."
5,CAN'T DO WITHOUT THIS HANDY POT,"This little steamer is the most used pot in my kitchen.REASONS I REACH FOR IT EVERYDAY:A. NO HANDLE TO EXTEND OVER FRONT OF COOKTOPB. NO HANDLE TO EXTEND OVER ANOTHER BURNERC. HOLDS ENOUGH VEGETABLES FOR SIXD. COMPACT TO STOREE. EASE OF USE ENCOURAGES ME TO COOK ""HEALTHY""I have purchased 9 of these steamers and have encouraged friends to buy them. Total count of steamers in use by my friends is 27!! (and not a one of them would part with it)"
5,Works well and Looks nice in the process,"This was a gift for someone else. That said, I've heard nothing but good things about how well it works. The price is very reasonable, and its a nice sturdy steamer."
5,Great Steamer,This Steamer is exactly as advertised...works very very well...nothing but great vegetables all the time!!!...Looked at all the local stores but found it at Amazon.com...Will buy again from Amazon for sure...
5,Farbareware Classic Cookware,I enjoy my Farbarware Classic cookware. It heats up fast and even. I like the stainless steel-clad bottom much better that the old aluminum-clad bottom. The stainless steel bottom is much easier to clean off tuff grease stains if you have to you an oven cleaner. I lost all of my Farbareware cookware to Hurricane Katrina and have replaced it. needed.
2,"Be careful it's hot, very hot on the handles","I agree this is a solid cookware. But it is so hot on the handles everytime I try to remove it from the stove. I believe they can do something about the design of the handles. BTW, my hands are not so sensitive to heat normally. But this is super hot beyond my tolerance."
4,Good but small,"great steamer. Handles do get hot, its very small. But it cooks the food so.If you have a large family buy a larger one."
5,Excellent product.,This pan has worked very well for me. I steamed vegetables in the steamer pan and noodles in the bottom at the same time. I used it with my DuLux Induction cook top.
3,the handles get so hot that it burns your hands!,overall nice product and cheap. but be aware the handles get so hot that it will burn you if you do not use potholder!update 1: I took off one star of my original review. I used it last night and today I found out there are some weird stains in and out of the pot and steamer already!
5,Farberware Steamer,"I really love steamers... Veggies never tasted so good!I'll put 5 stars here, but I wish they came in different sizes (6-Quart wouldn't be bad huh?)."
1,Cults?,"This is an ongoing fundamentalist christian belief (that's been around forever) that no one can be a christian unless you came to God in their prescribed manner.If you don't, you're either a cult such as Mormons or simply (non) christian which would include the Catholic church.Meditation has been in the past and is apparently still considered evil to the fundamentalist christian even though it's nothing more than prayer.I can't understand why any Christian would promote such hate - isn't it the opposite of what Jesus taught."
5,Great read,"Fight for joy in Jesus. This book is very helpful, and Scripture filled. Not a Christian? This book can benefit the Christian and non-Christian alike."
5,Practical and insightful,"This is a really practical and insightful work of John Piper. It helped me a lot to rethink my behavior towards God. This book is in fact an answer from God for my prayers, then I really needed to think about the importance of Joy in my life."
4,Just a comment,"I have read a few of Piper's books, but I have not read this book. I agree with J. W. Redding's well-articulated comments. Piper's theme in most of his books, ""God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him,"" just never resonated with me. But Piper's book, ""Don't Waste Your Life,"" has a slightly different emphasis that really does resonate with me: ""Make much of Christ."""
1,Poor,"If I wanted a hack job commentary on Johnathan Edwards and CS Lewis, next time I will try to find someone who is a little more insightful than Mr Piper. Format: Quote, restate, weak commentary, then another quote. People pay him to do this?"
5,Challenging,"I found this book to be very challenging. Not because it's hard to read--not at all. The author makes his point very clear and makes it easy to understand. What is challenging is applying the concept to your life. Once you've read this book you understand how important it is to serve God with joy, not just with deeds. Everyone should be trying to find the joy that John Piper talks about in this book. If every Christian could fully embrace this idea we really would be walking, talking billboards for God."
3,Works for Small Magazines!,I was looking for bags for my collectible magazines and these only fit the smaller magazines. I did not like that there was no way to secure the opening and had to tape them. Would prefer to have larger bags than these.
1,Very disappointed!,"I chose this item since a reviewer liked it very much. However, I am very disappointed after receiving. The bag is much thinner than others and I am afraid it can't protect books or items well. I suggest the manufacturers changes its name from ""ultra pro"" to ""ultra unpro""!Do not waste your money!"
4,Above average Post Hardcore (Postmodern D-Beat) album,I thought the sound was slightly overproduced and the A and R breakdowns and look of the band was slightly Universal and commercial other than that it's pretty intense Post Hardcore and definitely worth your hard-earned cash.
1,worked better with my old cables,you get what you pay for on this one. my hdtv looked better with my old cables. i do not recommend this product. standard definition looks terrible by the way. just looks ok with my blu-ray player. i was not impressed.
1,Didn't work on Samsung LN40A650 and PS3,Hooked myPlayStation 3 80GBup to mySamsung LN40A650 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Colorand the screen flickered really bad while playingCall of Duty: World at War. The entire screen would cut out as well as the sound. Makes me wonder if this HDMI cable can fully support 1080p or not. At least it was cheap. You get what you pay for.
4,Great Cable great price only one knock ( on description),"This cable works great used on my dvd player with easylink to tv. audio and video work right from the start no problems like other cables.Only knock i have is with the description, it states is Xbox 360 compatible, but cannot use this directly with an Xbox 360. You have to buy a Xbox Specific cable, not a so called compatible one."
3,"Product is terrific, delivery method not.","The cables were well packed, exactly what I need and were sent in a timely manner. Thank you.However, the seller should know that FedEx Ground often uses even clearly marked delivery addresses as a suggestion, and will leave packages on the stoops of any random building on the block. My neighbor was kind enough to re-deliver this to me this morning."
4,Excellent service,Product seems to be of high quailty.Works very well in the applications that I am using it.Delivery was as promised and I would not hesitate doing businus with this firm again.
5,"Great Price, Works Well",HDMI cables are notoriously expensive in brick-and-mortar shops. The combination of great prices and free shipping makes this a HDMI cable a bargain.
5,GREAT!!!,"its worth buying!!! it comes like new!!! its nice looking!!! its worth risking the very small chance of getting it in bad condition. If its not what you expect, remember it was practically free."
5,Great cable great price,This HDMI cable was a great price and just as good as the store ones that cost double or triple this price. It works great and we will always buy these from Amazon!
1,Stopped working after 9 months,"I'm really ticked off about this cable! I bought it in November. And now on August 1st it stopped working today. I took the laptop downstairs to another HDMI cable and it worked fine. This Cable on 2 different tvs did not work all of the sudden. I connected a Blue-Ray today and the connection was going in and out. I thought it was my wireless connection until I realized the video out to the tv was not working on the laptop where an internet connection was not necessary. No warranty.It doesn't matter if it's a good deal if it doesn't even last a year! I have HDMI cables that have been connected from receivers, etc. to the tvs for over 5 years! I won't buy from here again!."
2,inexpensive but not properly shielded,"This HDMI cable occasionally crackles. If the connection is jostled, the noise goes away but it works itself loose again. Our other cable didn't have this problem with the same DVD player and so I'm blaming it on the cable."
1,This HDMI cord is worthless,"Do not waste your money on this HDMI cord, one day it just stopped showing the picture. It is poor quality and will break on you."
3,Pretty good,"Besides it overheating after a few hours of playing, it's great. Cheaper but still good enough to game leisurely. Still works after a week or so xD"
2,OK,"Not sure why it did not work for my Samsung HDTV and Mac book pro hook up. However, it did work for my Sony HDTV and regular HDMI hook up. Not too happy because I have another better quality HDMI cable that works for both set ups. Sticking to the better cable."
2,Sometimes Works,"Cable works with some combinations of devices but doesn't work at all with others. Works on one TV with my Xbox, another it works with the computer but not the Xbox while one of my other cables works flawlessly. I'll be buying a slightly better cable next and trashing this one."
1,hdmi cable category2,after hooking it up the connection produced blue flickering spotsi ended up going to costco paid a little more but the reception was perfecti threw the sanoxy outi guess you get what you pay for
1,Not 1080P,"I got this for my Apple TV1080P. It works just fine on my older 720P Apple TV, but cuts in and out on the 1080....spend the extra couple bucks and get a better cable. Because I believed my cable to be capable of full 1080P, I brought my Apple TV back to the store.....I should have known better"
4,Cheap and Good,"I bought this cable for the kitchen TV, so I wasn't concerned about ultimate performance, or snob appeal, but I can find no fault with it. It works and it's cheap. Probably because it is cheap, this cable is thinner and more flexible than some--that's a plus where I'm using it. I recommend this product.Paul"
2,Hit and miss,"Got two of these cables for my Samsung 52A650 television. The HDMI cable from my cable DVR works great 99% of the time -- a couple glitches here and there, so I may replace it in the future.The HDMI cable from my Blu-Ray player to the TV had problems from the beginning. Would be watching about 30 minutes, then *poof* just static and snow on the screen. Bumped the cable a couple times and it would be ok... until the next time. That one finally went into the garbage and I replaced it with at $29 cable from Philips, which works flawlessly.At the price, it's an ok deal, but buy at least two for each device you plan to hook up as it's likely one of them will be defective."
3,Works with some TV's,"The cable did not work good with my Sony V series alot of noise but worked flawlessly on the Sony X and LCD rear projection TV (cant recall the model) series tried my PS3 on all TV's with the same settings.both other TV's were using Bravia engine 1 , mine was a Bravia engine 2."
4,"Works well, just be gentle.","Worked fine but the metal plug ripped off the end the very first day I had it. I got a replacement and has worked great ever since. Just be slightly careful if you need to unplug it, I do unplug mine from time to time without incident. Other than that, the signal looked great and the middle of the cord was thick and strong."
5,HDMI Cable Cat 2,Everything is as advertised. At first I thought the ends weren't gold as advertised but everything is great. Highly recommend.
3,HDMI cable,Its a product that fills a purpose .I've had a hdmi cable for about 5 years.I paid $25.00 for it. I saw a bargain.
1,not happy,Bought two of these HDMI cables and took one to the cabin to hook up dvd player to tv. The cable didn't work. Don't know if the other one works. I will check when I get home. So far looks like you get what you pay for.
5,HDMI or HDMI ?,This HDMI cable is a good quality one. Even If I have never seen a bad quality HDMI cable. It does a good job connecting my Xbox 360 and DVD player to an HDTV.
4,Works OK but you need extra adaptor if using headset and HDMI for 360.,"The HDMI cable works OK with our plasma (someone was asking if was only for LCD before) but if you are using it with your XBOX 360 and you have a headset (Turtle Beach-type, not the regular ones) you'll also need the adaptor for audio OUT. I should have checked before, because the adaptor by itself is more expensive than cable and adaptor together, at least here in Amazon. Otherwise, no problem. Recommended, especially for the price."
5,I liked,I liked also an excellent product and I am happy to deal with you and I would recommend buying the product
5,Good and Cheap!,I bought this cable because it was far cheaper than buying one in the store. I wasn't sure if it was good quality or not. I hoooked it up to our new Blue Ray Player and it worked great. It's not too long or too short. Perfect!
4,No surprises.,for a couple of dollars this is what you would expect. Nothing fancy. Does what it needs to do without any problems.
5,Definitely recommend this!,I bought this and it works great. It is much cheaper then buying one in a store for much more.
1,Wrong cable,It wasn't what the picture advertised and didn't fit my tv. I would've called and complained then I realized it was a dollar what could it hurt.
1,Poor,"I bought 4 of theses , once connected quality was good and all worked well, after only disconnecting once and reinstalling the continuity in the cable all broke they fail even with the smallest bend! all four have now become u/s"
2,Didn't work for me...,"I bought this cable just so I wouldn't have to change out my HDMI cable from my xbox to my ps3. The cable will work ""as long as you make sure you don't play in HD."" But who wants an HD cable that doesn't let you use HD. I had to play my games as if they were from the ps2 era on my HD tv. Maybe I got a bad cable but I doubt it."
5,what u see is what u get,Works perfectly. I dont see why other cables are in the $50-$100 dollar range. That seems preposterous. It is just cable for heaven's sakes.This one had the correct price for me.
4,cables are perfect,"These cables are a great savings compared to the big stores and work great, make sure you select HDMI cables that are category 2 full 1080 capable. Will buy these again."
1,Atleast they were cheap as free,"Ya these worked out well when I first got them, it went all downhill from there. My games looked good, but my blu-rays on my Toshiba were terrible, the picture was jumpy (it was jumping between the current picture and a picture 1sec ahead) and you couldn't enjoy the movie at all. And on top of all that, 2 weeks later I turn on the PS3 and pictures gone, cables were fried, I'm using the A/V cables included till my Sony brand component cables arrive"
5,Great product,"This is a great product at a very reasonable price, I have HDMI cables on all of our TVs and love the quality we get!!"
3,hdmi cable,"Okay Product good price worked with dvd, but did not work with ps3 xbox or other game system as advertised."
5,I Love These Cables!!!!,I bought these cables because my friend got some for like $40.00 and it looked nice but i didn't want to spend all that money so i went on amazon and i found these for like $4.00 and they look they same as my friend. I would defintly buy these. why would you want to pay $40.00 for HD cables when you can get these for $4.00 and have it look excatly the same.
3,hdmi cat2,"It works great with excellect picture quality, and price was perfect. Will definately order two or three more cables like this.HDMI Cable 2M (6 Feet)"
3,Great buy,Great price but sound does not always come in have to turn tv off and then back on. Picture quality is good for the price.
3,HDMI Cable,The only problem I experienced was the cable connection could not fit or insert in my televion connection. I eventually had to use the HDMI 2 port.
3,Works. But thin,This is my 2nd HDMI cable I've bought and this one is far thinner than my other one I paid for the same price. No ferrite bead just a simple thin cable. But it works. Next time I buy a cable I'll be buying a different one.
3,Not bad but not great,This product can is great who dont want to waste money for same results. I ordered 2 hdmi cables. 0ne of them is working perfectly. the other one sometimes laggs. the screen blackouts sometime for 3-5 seconds. sometimes its a bummer.
4,A cheap but very capable cable,"To an end with all of those expensive over priced hdmi cables. Because the signals are digital (no longer analog like before) these cables can be terminated metal clothes hangers for all I care. As long as the whole signal goes from one end to the other, you will get a pretty picture. I use this with my xbox to my samsung TV and it works like a charm. Recommended for anyone with a budget and doesnt care about a fancy brand name."
3,"the Hdmi cable is great, but....",the cable is great. the price of it compared to the 30 and 40 dollars is a steal. the only prob. i have is that i already have a $40 hdmi cable and the sound on that cable is great. but this one the sound is not very loud. i have to turn my TV to the max to the sound = to my high price cable. overall happy i bought it. $30 vs. $6 no brainer.
5,Great HDMI Cable for Price!!,The cable was very inexpensive and shipping was very quick and product was as described.
5,Works perfect on PS3,I bought this cable to go with my PS3 and it works just fine. I have an LG 3D LED and the picture looks great in 2D and 3D. Still don't understand why people pay more than a few bucks for a cable.
1,Cable did not work for me,"When trying to use this cable with my PS3 and my HDTV, it did not work. When using a different HDMI cable, everything worked fine, but this cable did not show up as anything.The company selling it does have a very good policy, however, and I was given back my money for the product."
3,It's okay...,"It works good, makes my ps3 look way better than with the stock red/yellow/white cables, but there's a lot of flashing white dots all over the screen. I can't really complain since the the cable was at a low price, but I'm still a little disappointed."
4,good quality,just received this item and let me tell you i'm fully satisfied with this product. walmart sells them for 30 bucks but i paid 1.67 for this. very happy right now!
2,Ehh,"Well, quick delivery..works..but if you aren't using a tv with 1080 static specs will appear. So only get it if you have the right tv."
2,Has some problems,"Beware: I've had these cables for over 3 months and during that time I've experience quite a few black outs/failures. I used two of these HDMI cables to connect from a Sony DVD player and Uverse box to a Sony LCD TV, and both cables fail from time to time (the screen either blacks-out or says I've ""loss HD connectivity""). I pin-pointed the problem to the cables b/c ever since I've replaced them, I no longer have the ""black-out"" problem. However, good points are they're cheap and replaceable."
4,Works as it should...but,"The product works great as it says...but with one tiny flaw. I unplugged the av cables while my 360 slim was on, and plugged in the hdmi cable. Turns out that the 360 has to restart in order for the graphics to look HD. Lost a few hours of campaign progress on ODST. Other than that, it works great. Definitely recommend this product to everyone."
1,PS3 can not reach 1080p,"PS3 can not reach 1080p with this cable, everything else being equal, the same PS3/HDTV works fine with the Monster cable. Of course, the price is in no comparison anyway."
2,it works,the game works ok and the kids seem to use it a lot. I had to buy a flat screen to play it on cause the old tv wouldn't work.
5,HDMI,"""The 6 foot HDMI product is better than the picture provided as it included cable end caps that protect the gold ends during shipment, storage, or when not in use. Also, the quality can be readily appreciated in the well made connector ends - where the rubber meets the road sort to speak, SUPER!It works perfect like any pricier monsterous etc product out there for much, much less! Yes, I have one of those too - ouch!Amazon, thanx for offering this on our Super free market here in America, my hat off to you! I would like to add that May God Bless America so that she will live on 4 ever without the current push for huge govt controls which history proves do lead to Socialism - Totalitarianism and of course no free markets... unless you consider the illegal/dangerous black markets free and dictators cool..."
4,A Needleworker's Must Have Reference Book.,"From the history of needlework beginnings and styles, to today's modern stitchery methods, this book has it all. With easy to understand instructions and diagrams for projects even a beginner can follow, yet challenging enough for the expert. It is a book you will return to again and again to learn knitting, crocheting, embroidery, quilting, needlepoint, netting, tatting, rugmaking, braiding, weaving, knotting, and basic sewing."
3,The world needs more torrid bodice-rippers!,"Merchants Of Venus (love that title) is a surprisingly dry retelling of the genesis of the Harlequin empire, from its humble origins as reprinters of nurse romances to its death-grip on the enormously lucrative paperback romance industry (number 1 paperback publisher in the world). Somehow I expected the author to really juice this story: it's got international intrigue, steamy sex, board-room shenanigans, and pouty superstars. The facts are all there, which is the fascinating part, it's just the delivery is so darn academic. For a just-the-facts recounting of a fascinating phenomenon, Merchants of Venus is great. For a steamy bodice-ripper of a tale, well I guess you'll have to go to the source."
1,Wait for the special edition DVD,"There's a special edition widescreen DVD being released in February 2007, which has remastered audio and video and better extras. Don't buy this horrible version."
1,The Studio Managed To Destroy A Classic Tale,"This dvd release is so horrible. This movie should have been restored to the level it deserved to be. They made it full screen with lousy, awful, distorted sound and I guess the bonus features are the extra grainy picture and ugly cover art. All of us fans of the movie deserve a re-release of the dvd complete with bonus features, 5.1 sound, complete digital restoration and more of a mystical,magical, beautiful cover to the dvd. They should know by now that they can sell more if they give us more.Studio people please rescue this film from complete destruction."
5,Great Movie even still..,I remember as a young child going to the movie theaters with my family. Seeing this movie brings back so many memories. I remember feeling scared for the Unicorn as well as hoping that everything would turn out good. I am really glad I was able to find this movie on amazon. Great Movie!!!!!
3,The Last Unicorn - Review,A brave unicorn and a magician fight an evil king who is obsessed with attempting to capture the world's unicorns.
3,Childhood Nostalgia,"I loved this movie as a kid, and I still enjoy it, but it would have been better with a few of the songs cut out (mainly Mia Farrow's). The animation style is still very neat, and I'm glad to own it on DVD instead of the VHS from my childhood."
2,No offense!,"Despite the enthusiastic comments of the artists involved (watch the making of) and the hardly less enthusiastic reviews on this site this film has a rather banal story line with rather banal dialogue. Moreover the design of the title character (unicorn and girl) looks like a combination of a Barbie doll and your customary anime girlie. Apparently the layouts of the US artists had to be oversimplified by Japanese animators. Though I like the witch and the Red Bull. And then there are the awful songs by folk rock group America which are only topped by the ones sung by the characters themselves. The best thing to mention is the background design which occasionally follows medieval art and reminds you of Disney's Sleeping Beauty. Yes, and I don't mind the sometimes grainy picture quality."
2,Disappointing -- not like I remember,"I'm pretty upset by the DVD. For some 20 years I've watched the VHS version that my mom taped off the TV, and being a 27 year-old woman I'm still obsessed with this movie and watch it every time I go home. I couldn't believe that I could get this wonderful film on DVD now, considering the fact that only my parents own a VCR these days. But, it was weird to watch -- there are different sounds either I don't notice on the VHS version, or that are new. And there are parts in it that must have been edited from the version I grew up with; props to adding them back in, but it ruins the movie for me. It's just not exactly right. I think I'll just have to keep watching my parents tape, because after 20 years I don't think I can handle these mini changes. *sigh*"
1,The Last Unicorn VHS,"Actually I would like the option to give this tape a 0 star rating. I bought this video for my pre-school aged nephews as a Christmas gift. I thought a Rankin Bass video would be good/safe for children. I finally watched it with them the other day. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie for anyone. The characters in the story swear. A haggish woman swears at the unicorn saying ""Damn you, damn you!"" The knight/hero character says ""Damn."" A troll type creature says something like ""What the Hell, am I supposed to look at."" and a magician takes God's name in vain after being accosted by a tree he brought to life, which is a buxom ""woman tree"" who makes a pass at the magician. Shocking. If my nephews went up to their parents and used these expressions from the movie, they would be reprimanded by their parents who do not talk like that. I now know that I need to preview every video I buy for my nephews before giving them a present. Shame on Rankin Bass"
1,long and weird,"This movie is very long, and very weird and a little too scary for my 6 year old girl who likes unicorns. It's quite dark and depressing for a kids movie."
1,CUSS Words for children!!!! Give me a break!,"If you monitor what your children watch, don't buy this as it has several incidences of foul adult language! It has the word ""damn"" in it twice and other situations that are for adults. I gave it a one star because the graphic animation is nicely done."
1,Can't Manage to think about it...,"The Last Unicorn is a TERRIBLE movie, for one the DVD release was very poor, and some aspects of the film weren't made for children...or ANYONE, for that matter. There isn't really a point to this film, so DO NOT BUY IT!"
4,Wonderful classic with a terrible dvd release,"The last Unicorn is a true cartoon classic, its magical story telling at its best, great for kids of all ages and most adults will enjoy it as well. The reason I deduced a star was simpally because of the dvd release. Being a student in the DVD field I can tell that they simpally took an old vhs master and boosted the resolution in hopes that it would imitate DVD quality but it failed miserably. However that doesnt work, boosting the resolution on an old master like that brings out its flaws. I bought the DVD and recorded the cartoon off television onto a DVD-R. I compaired them side by side and can honestly say the television recording holds out better overall. Its sad that classics like this are neglected, but then again business is business."
1,"This is wonderful movie, but an awful release of it","Let me start by saying that The Last Unicorn is my favorite movie of all time. I have loved it since I was very, very young. However, I truly wish I had never bought this DVD.First off, the movie is full screen and not widescreen--this could easily be forgiven if the DVD didn't have numerous other problems. The picture quality is awful and looks as though they ripped the movie from the old VHS master. There are also some scenes where the contrast seems to be up too high. I know that these are not simply issues with the original movie because I have the German release and its picture is flawless (not to mention widescreen) and beautiful. This release also has one of the worst menus I have ever seen. The DVD says it has special features, but I can't find them!If you're a hardcore Last Unicorn fan, don't buy this DVD. Your old VHS version is just as good."
1,Don't Buy this dvd!!!,"The reason you should not buy this dvd is not because it is a bad movie. The company releasing it has taken all profits due to the author of the story. The websites www.conlanpress.com\youcanhelp, and www.unicorntears.com have all the pertinent info, don't support these thieves. I put my vhs version onto dvd."
1,"Wonderful movie, but terrible DVD","""The Last Unicorn"" is one of my favorite childhood movies, and the movie itself certainly deserves 5 stars. However, the DVD version is so poor, quality-wise, that I cannot recommend it. I read the reviews here at Amazon before purchasing it, but I thought surely it couldn't be as bad as everyone was making out. I'm no DVD expert, so I thought perhaps it was only DVD aficionados who were upset. However, I was mistaken. It really is terrible. All I care about is having a nice, clear picture, and this print is dark, dirty, and flickers strangely throughout the film. It's a shameful way to treat a wonderful movie. I only hope that it will be re-released properly at some point!"
5,Mystical,"This movie meant so much to me, because I remember it from when I was a child. I am so in love with the way the cartoons were drawn. I also love their responses to the questions and task they are asked. There truly is no other movie like it."
5,Absolutely magical.,"This movie really does the book justice, which makes sense since Peter S. Beagle adapted the script from the novel himself. The voices fit their characters perfectly, and the animation is wonderful. The opening sequence with the unicorn tapestry is especially nice. And the soundtrack with songs by America can be stuck in your head for days. Overall, a fantastic magical movie. Perfect for any age."
5,Five stars or more,"This is an excellent movie for everyone. I first saw it in highschool and was enchanted then and am just as so now. It has beautiful music, great acting, and is funny and serious. When I feel down in this ugly hum drum world of mondainity I pop This wonderful fantasy in the VCR and escape for a while. A good intriguing story. Rankin and Bass are always good. The animation/drawing to some may not seem the best but it is appropriate for this fantasy and is very pretty. A good fantasy anime for the whole family."
5,the best cartoon to remeber,"I remeber watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid and I cried every time. I hadn't seen it for over ten years and now I once again own a copy. Even though I'm in college now I still watch it a lot. It's not only a awesome movie, but something that should remind everyone of when they were watching it when they were young."
5,Enchanting and Beautiful,"This is one of my favorite movies. When I was really little, my friend had this and we always watched it. When she moved away, she gave it to me. I still have it (I'm 13 now). It's so incredible!! This isn't really a little kid movie, because the storyline is mature for little kids to follow. I love how they make it with the Japanese anime style of animation. Especially when the unicorn turns human, she is so gorgeous. And the music is so touching. I love it also because I love unicorns. If you're an adult, this will bring back childhood memories for you."
1,not for small kids,I was shocked thatthis had a G rating with the language used. Not for small kids who are impressionable and repeat what they hear. Other than that a good fanatsy story.
2,A children's movie which could have been edited to 45 min.,"My family found this movie to be long and tedious. Even my three year old daughter does not want to see it again. Overall, the dialog is monotone and the songs are more of the plot than the characters. Unfortunately these songs are all done in the same whiny tone."
1,"Great movie, stunningly disappointing DVD release","I have no idea what they did to the soundtrack of this release - it is horrible! There is inappropriate background music that almost drowns out the dialog in some scenes. Most of the actual songs seem normal, but the mixing levels between the voices, sound effects, and ""ambiance"" music is way, way off.The color transfer also seems very shoddy in places - too dark in several scenes, such as at the outlaws' camp.Altogether, it is horribly disappointing to see such a wonderful movie treated in this way."
2,WHY!?,"Why did they have to ruin such a great movie with such a TERRIBLE DVD treatment??? I waited so long for this movie to be released. I grew up with it; to me it is way better than many of the Disney movies around(specially the most recent ones). Like many other reviewers wrote on here, the picture quality is TERRIBLE, contrasts are over done, the image doesn't even look sharp and for some reason it keeps jumping on my tv screen!I have also the VHS version of this film, and sadly enough I find NO DIFFERENCE with the dvd version. I hope someday a kind studio will rerelease this fantasy gem improved as it deserves, just like Disney did with the new version of Alice in Wonderland. But let's face it, this might take years, it it ever happens."
5,The Goodness that is Unicorns and the Movie about Them.,"I love this movie. My grandparents had it at their house when I was little, and they would let me watch it sometines when I came over. It is of no little amount of sentimental value to me. I love Unicorns, and I always thought that the way this movie ended was a beautiful way to reaffirm the magik in life in a world that has altoghther forgotten it. Again, a beautiful thing. (...)"
5,Pure magic and heart. A timeless classic.,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was four, and I remember loving it. That was fifteen years ago, and The Last Unicorn continues to inspire me. The animation is amazing for the time, and the music is euphoric and memorable. Above all, the story is captivating and real, and will encourage everyone to believe in the magic and existence of unicorns. It's a timeless movie about believing in what your heart knows to be the truth...and there's even a mean, red bull for the boys who don't care much for magic."
5,"Wonderful, but another site is better","this newest version is stunning, now with better picture and sound quality. Unfortunately, and not many people know this, the author of the book and writer of screenplay Peter Beagle does not earn a single cent off of the sale of this movie, except through a special website. [...]"
2,"Fantastic Movie, Worse Transfer Seen DVD","I remember seeing the Last Unicorn when it was first released in the 80's and loved it ever since. The story should keep adults interested throughout, with a wonderful story about dreams, love and sacrifice. The voice acting is first rate as well as the soundtrack. Yet, the transfer onto DVD is the worst I've even seen, the opening titles are blurry, the picture fuzzy. One review questioned that it may have came from the master VHS. I would not even go that far, it's a very poor copy, as for the sound, if you have 5.1 surround, you'll hear music and the voices coming from all directions. I view my movies on a HDTV, and that's even no help. As for extras, there are none, not even a trailer. So should you get it? Its nice to have it added to my collection, but expect a poor VHS viewing vice the clear DVD."
4,Stunning,"I saw this move once when I was very young, and for the longest time I couldn't find anyone else who had seen it. I almost wasn't sure I really had seen a movie called ""The Last Unicorn."" Then, joy of joys, several years later I happened upon the tape, and watched it again. It was twice as good as I'd remembered. This is the type of movie you can't get out of your head. It's just absolutely stunning. The only reason I can't give it the 5 stars is because no movie could ever equal Peter s. Beagle's heart-breakingly beautiful, yet hilarious book. Nothing could come closer than this."
5,An absolutely excellent fantasy movie for everyone,"I absolutely loved this movie as a child and must have watched it over a thousand times. I could hardly believe that I would ever find it again. This movie is so true to the book, which is very rare nowadays. It sparked my interest in fantasy and has to me been a classic for all times. It's touching love story, element of fantasy, and endearing characters have stuck with me throughout my life.I would recommend it for anyone of any age!"
3,DVD features? Where?,"Although I waited for the DVD release of this movie primarily for the archival quality of DVDs, I did expect there to be SOME special features included with the disc.The quality of the movie itself did not bother me, since I have only been able to view it from VHS tapes. However, I know the movie did not exist in a vacuum and so I am left to wonder where any additional interviews, footage or commentary may be wandering.I still love the movie, and if you haven't seen it, you must think unicorns are for wussies."
1,Shame on you Artisan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Artisan Entertainment has put out some beautiful DVDs in the past. The new T2 Extreme and Stargate Director's Cut are just a couple. This pan and scan release of The Last Unicorn is a true travesty. I have never seen a worse picture in my life on a DVD. Yes, it's that bad. Shame on you Artisan, F.H.E., Carlton, and whoever else had anything to do with this DVD. This is a classic, beloved movie and it deserves so much better than this."
4,"Great movie, bad DVD...","The Last Unicorn is an excellent and touching film, created by the same people who animated The Hobbit. It remained as true as practicable to the book by Peter S Beagle, and is still a delight to watch.However, the first DVD release is rather disappointing. Very little effort was apparently made: the video quality is poor, and the film it was taken from is clearly badly in need of restoration. There are no special features, and the packaging looks babyish--the characters are drawn with little effort at looking true to the film, and the blurb on the back was clearly written by some hack who didn't bother to watch the film.Don't be in too much of a rush to replace your cherished old VHS, if it's still in good shape! Let's hope that they put pit a higher-quality copy in the future."
4,"Love the movie, the DVD was a nice addition to my collection.",The DVD was in new packaging and played very well. I wish it was in better definition but I do not think this movie has been brought up to date with digital imaging yet. Love the film and was very happy with the swift shipping!
4,It should be a horror film,When i saw this on t.v i was only 4 and I was totally scared. I found the red bull terrifing. It then stayed at the back of my mind for aged. I just remembered it as scary. But when my i saw it listes in the t.v paper I told my 4 year old sister. I deicided to watch it with her thinkin I would realise how silly I had been. After they started hearing the Bull I started to get scared. I almost had to leave the room. I felt really stupid when my sister was enjoying the film a lot. I dont no what it is about it but it should be a childrens horror. Defintaly a sleepover horror im actually old enough to rent myself!
2,"Spare Animation, too many pop ballads...","A delicate white unicorn (voiced by Mia Farrow) who believes herself to be the last of her kind sets out on a search for other mythological creatures. Along the trek she meets a bumbling wizard named Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) who accidentally transforms her from equine to human. She finds herself on the, er, horn of a dilemma. Somewhere between Mommy Fortuna's (Angela Lansbury) traveling curiosity show and the castle of the evil King Haggard (Christopher Lee), the unicorn meets Prince Lir (Jeff Bridges) and has to decide whether or not to tell him the truth about herself. Based on the novel by Peter S. Beagle, music by soft-pop group ""America"". A great sotry that doesn't quite work in this awkard animation style -- I'm curious to see how the live action version (currently in production) will fare.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,"Despite Popular Beliefs, Unicorns Age Poorly","A classic... But not in the running with today's animation. It's slow with scenes that children shall yawn at (for lack of understanding). The main reason I bought it is because I had a crush on the main character as a young child. Overall, however, this movie is tedious with weird charaters."
3,Where have you been????,"I was so upset that after going to all of the trouble to make such a great print of the film and call it an anniversary edition that they would edit the ""damns"" out of the film.... Let's just say I replaced them with my own when I realized the film had been censored!!!I sure wish there had been an audio option that would restore the original soundtrack or even two versions available for purchase!!!"
3,Also bought the autographed version.,"I'm glad the film has finally been released in its proper aspect ratio, but it looses points for the studio edits. It's not a huge deal, but I still find any form of censorship apalling. Do 'hell' and 'damn' even qualify as swear words anymore? Shame on you Lionsgate!"
4,"A little too scary for toddlers, but great for older kids","This is an absolutely lovely movie, and was one of my favorites as a kid. However, just a quick warning to parents: despite the pastel-colored cover, some of the action may be too intense/adult for very young children. Even re-watching this film as an adult, I found many scenes downright scary! The few swear words have been edited out, but I always found the worse problem to be the scariness factor. I think one of the reasons this movie has always been more of a ""cult classic"" than a true blockbuster is due to its never quite finding the right audience: some elements (the few songs, the Rankin-Bass characters) are simply too childish for grown-ups, but the story is a bit too dark for small kids. I would say 7 to 11 is the ideal age group. However, even adults who enjoy a haunting, beautiful story that is a little off the beaten path will find this classic worth the pennies."
2,"Great Movie, Poor Quality Release","I remember seeing this movie at the Drive-In when I was a child. I used to have it on VHS until it was destroyed. I couldn't wait till it came out on DVD. However, once I got my copy I became rather disappointed with the quality. The colors look faded, It's Full-Screen only, It even seems to be slightly crooked and there are distortions at the very top of the screen..... What a horrible way to release such a classic."
3,A timeless classic,"This movie was one that was introduced to me as a young child, and I continued to watch it over and over while growing up because I liked it so much. It was really fun to watch again as an adult!! If I have kids someday I hope they enjoy it as much as I did when I was a kid."
3,The Last Unicorn,The movie was not as good as I had expected & is a little mature for a 5 yr old. I wouldn't buy this again although my grandaughter seemed to like it alright.
5,"Oldy, but goody",I watched this when I was young. My daughter loves the fantasy horses like unicorns and pegusus. She enjoyed the movie. Thanks.
2,Horrible quality. Believe it.,"Well, unlike the people that read the reviews about ""horrible quality"" and bought it anyways, I'm here because of the horrible quality lol. I got this DVD in through netflix and it did indeed look awful. However, the DVD was quite scratched so I thought maybe... just maybe... because it was such consistent scratching over the whole DVD, it was just that and I'd get a newer copy. So, here I am after a google search for ""last unicorn"" AND ""poor quality"" AND DVD. So, apparantly it just does suck that bad lol. Oh well.Anyways, believe it. I thought I was watching a worn out VHS copy of the film. Poor indeed. A crying shame :("
3,"Wonderful movie, awful DVD","... This is an all time classic animated movie. So beautiful and touching, but this DVD release, for all the time we've waited for it, looks like it was knocked up in an afternoon. Shabby VHS->DVD transfer with hazy, shakey images and rough sound, no extras of any kind and in 4:3 only. What a tragedy! :-(To everyone that was as disappointed as me with the poor quality of the DVD, I urge you to look forward to the cinematic release of Peter S. Beagle's remake of The Last Unicorn, featuring a number of the original cast. ..."
1,WONDERFUL MOVIE BUT HORRIBLE DVD RELEASE!!!,"I have been waiting for a region 1 dvd for a long time and I couldnt wait to watch this wonderful film on my widescreen HDTV, only to find out this has been released fullscreen, so I decided to rent this movie instead of buying. Not only is this movie fullscreen but it looks like a bad VHS transfer. unexcusable! This dvd should have never been released like this. ..."
4,"Delightful, whimsical and an all around good fantasy story","My four year old is positively obsessed with unicorns, we rented it from a local video store a few months ago and now we have to buy it or I'll go broke renting it!! I have watched it with my daughter several times and it is quite enchanting as far as the theme goes. The animation is typical Japanese style and the music typical early 80's! But to little children who live in fantasy worlds 95% of the time, this is a good movie."
5,"A misterious breathe taking tale of hope, and imagination!","This amazing movie stole all of my emotions and put them on film. I laughed, cried, and I stood on the edge of my seat through out the entire movie! I am still just a child and enjoy watching it over and over with my friends and family. It's a great movie that I would love to share with my children. (when I grow up and have some). END"
2,HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY,"This DVD has the worst picture quality of any DVD I have ever seen. It looks like VHS, in fact it appears to be a transfer directly from VHS. The sound is decent but it's hard for me to get past the terrible picture quality but my daughter seemed to like it anyway."
5,A Truly Beautiful Film!,"When I was about four or five years old I loved to watch The Last Unicorn. Spotting it at Blockbuster, I decided to rent it, wondering how I would see it now.I was worried when I saw that the animation was Rankin/Bass, but in the end I found it to be a visual confection.Some of the characters do look a little cheesy, but most of the time the animation dazzled me. In particular Mommy Fortuna's tree stump hat is very cool, forestscapes are ethereal, and I love Molly's BIG brown eyes.My favorite scene is the meeting of Molly and the Unicorn...The woman is angered that the Unicorn came to her at a low point in her life rather than when she was ""new and innocent."" After that schpiel Molly embraces her and whispers, ""I forgive you.""To my mind, this is one of those works like The Little Prince or The Mouse and His Child that is meant for chidren but is sincere enough to captivate adults as well. Well done."
5,One of the great animated classics,"I remember loving ""The Last Unicorn"" as a child, and was thrilled to find it for sale on Amazon.com! This movie in it's fantasy setting, with it's subtle yet strong references to the endless struggle of good and evil...is absolutely amazing. This is a movie that will keep you spellbound with a story of love, beauty, greed, and sorrow. It is beautifully animated, and it keeps my own kids glued to their seats each time they watch it. ""The Last Unicorn"" is a must have for your video collection whether you are 5 or 105."
2,"Love the movie, hate this cut of it.","I can see I am not alone in my dislike of this DVD. As mentioned, this edition only comes in fullscreen, which I find annoying. The worst part has to due with the almost complete lack of cleaning the film; it looks like it was copied from the VHS.The sound was also sub-par, and obviously not mixed well. Considering I only paid nine bucks for it, I consider it a worthwhile purchase... My VHS is so worn that about half the movie is unwatchable. There are a couple of problems with the audio warping that was also not fixed in this edition.If you're like me (in the sense that you have a VHS in poor condition) and simply want a watchable version of this movie, then this cut shouldn't give you any problems. If you're a die-hard fan and want a bit more, go for the special edition. I hear good things, but have not seen it myself as of yet."
4,The Last Unicorn Anniversary Edition DVD,"My little girl and I both really liked this DVD, especially the enhanced 5.1 sound and cleaned up video transfer.Really, my only gripe with this edition is the small edits that remove a couple of uses of the words ""damn"" and ""hell,"" that I recall were used in the older versions.As far as price, order accuracy, speed of delivery, and payment and shipping accuracy, I cannot complain at all.I ordered online on a Saturday afternoon, and it was waiting for me before the following Friday."
5,Classic !!,The Last Unicorn is and always will be one of the greatest animated films of all time. The character journey is one of a kind and is a must see for all who have not been introduced.
4,the last unicorn,"Was ordered for my granddaughters, and was not what they expected. Was a little scary for her and her sister. The product itself was good and recieving it was all good and the person selling it was fair and shipped promptly."
5,One of the best cartoons ever,"This so brings me back to my childhood, I can't wait to be able to share it with my children."
1,Kids will love it - parents will hate it,"My three year old adores this movie. It does have a good plot and interesting characters, and there are some pretty funny scenes, so I can understand her feelings on that level. However... the soundtrack is DEPLORABLE. The music is mostly done by America, in their typical depressing, 70's-awful style. The lowlights are numbers sung by Jeff Bridges (who voices Lear) and Mia Farrow (who voices the unicorn). These two just can't sing. It's wonder they didn't die of shame when this movie was released. Worst of all, the songs have a tendancy to stick in your head until you wish you were dead - they're really that bad. In fact, my audiophile college-age nephew who lives with us refuses to stay in the house while my daughter is watching this movie. His ears just can't take it, I suppose. If you want to introduce your kids to this story, spare your ears and get Peter Beagle's classic book instead."
3,Not for younger children,"I had this video for a while, although it is well done and a pretty good story, the use of crude language may suprise you. It is not for little kids who are impressionable or rerpeat what they hear."
3,What's the similar one with real people in it?,"I love this version, but I seem to remember a version with real people and dwarves, and a girl transformed into red/black clothing, and a hideous chase thru a castle. Ring any bells? I want to own both!"
5,A true Classic,"One of the best cartoon movies of the 80s. If you have a child or want to go back to your days as a child, then this wonderful cartoon will bring back those golden moments. Also, if your pagan, this is one of the better movies on the list !...Highly recommended !"
3,"ok movie, horrible soundtrack","I bought this movie for my friend for Christmas because she begged me. While she thought it was an excellent movie, I have to say, ""yawn."" I don't have children, nor do I have younger siblings, so I can only guess that this is a good movie for kids. I will probably never watch it again. Also, the songs in this movie are absolutely horrbile. I cringed every time a song started. Kudos to America for trying, but...I also have to agree with the others who commented on the quality of the DVD. Two words: really poor"
5,So far so good,"I haven't watched this DVD yet because it's a present for someone, but it arrived sooner than expected and the DVD is in priginal packaging so it should be perfect. :)"
3,Movie from back in the day,Seller was great and got the movie here ASAP. Movie is ok a blast from the past and my kids love it like I did when I was little.
4,Lovely and exciting production,"An all-star animated film with a wonderful and captivating story for the whole family. Piece of trivia: The voice of the tree belongs to Nellie Bellflower, an actress when this was done, but now a film producer, having produced ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day""."
4,"Good Movie, Family Favorite - Recommended","We had to buy ""The Last Unicorn"" DVD because our VHS tape was worn out through years of use. This movie is one that my wife has always liked and wanted our children to enjoy as well. We watch it together at least twice a year now that the kids are older, but it is still one that either kid might watch on their own more often.The story is great, the animation is OK, and the DVD transfer is barely acceptable. That being said, this is a very worthwhile movie.Recommended!"
4,Warning,"I have always loved this movie and the DVD is worth the wait.A little word of warning though, this is a ""Full-screen edition"" not widescreen.Ultimately all I can say, If you like this movie it is worth buying it."
5,An Unforgettable Timeless Classic!,"I have seen this movie countless times since I was a little girl, and it has never ceased to amaze me. I have also read the book, and the movie follows it quite well. The music is spectacular, and sends chills down my spine every time I hear it. It is the story of a unicorn who is in search of the other unicorns, to find out what happened to them. Along the way she encounters both friends and enemies, and disguises herself as human to get past the Red Bull and free the other unicorns. it is an enchanting tale, one both children and adults are sure to fall in love with! I never get tired of it!"
5,Fairy Tale of the Search for Happiness,"Growing up in the 1st through the 8th grade I watched this movie through a school summer program every year. I have always loved it.This story is a wonderful fable about the search for happiness. An evil king eternally searches for happiness in the Unicorn. The gallant knight searches for happiness in ""The Lady Amalphia."" The wizard ""Smendrick"" searches for happiness in magic. Molly Grue searches for happiness in legends. But story asks the question of when are people truly happy--but I won't ruin the story. The ending is the best part of the whole story.The movie was a wonderful adaptation of the book, but I say to anyone who likes this movie--read the book and get the FULL story."
5,For six years i've been searching for it...,"Ever sinse i watched The Last Unicorn in primary school, i've been searching EVERYWHERE to find it. There was an option for my class, to either visit a gladiator and get an autograph, or stay and watch this video called the last unicorn. I stayed, and i've never regretted it. There was only about 8 of us, and as soon as it started we were fasinated by it. I can only vagualy[can't spell] remember parts, but the rest of the class came in about 20 minutes before the end, and guess what? We weren't allowed to watch the rest. The bull completely hypnotised me! I love fantasy and scary things and the bull terrified me! I can remember a tower with a clock, and a red kind of airy bull along with cages and an eagle, but that's all."
1,Very disappointing,"I remember loving this movie. Now I reget buying it due to the extremely poor quality of the DVD. Aside from the grainy picture quality and poor sound and music, I am very angry that there was no mention that this was the FULL SCREEN version on Amazon. I will keep this in mind the next time I consider purchasing something through them."
3,"Wonderful Movie, lousy DVD","This is an amazing, beautiful cartoon, but the DVD treatment borders on calous. It suffers from lousy video quality and a brutal pan-and-scan fullscreen treatment that frequently leaves both characters in a converstaion hanging off the edge of the screen.Still, it's the only Last Unicorn we're likely to get, so go buy it anyway."
5,It's the BEST!,"It ranks right up there with Legend, Labyrinth, and Sleeping Beauty as all time best movies. It's scary, beautiful, and breathtaking."
4,Classic Animation for the Ages,Absolutely great film. I watched this as a small child and loved it. Through the years I was growing up I lost the title of it but still vividly recalled the scenes. Now as an adult I finally got a chance to see it again and can safely say that it is more satsifying to me than it was as a child. A must see!
5,GREAT ANIMATION!!!,"The last unicorn is a favorite when i was a kid...this movie got an great story with superb graphics...really good animation, really recommend this unicorn..."
2,the songs are excruciating,"this is a really annoying movie. my kids will be watching it in the next room and my husband and i will be in agony, having to hear the corny songs and contrived dialogue coming in through the open door. now, if my kids were rating this they would probably give it 5 stars, they love it. go figure."
2,Keep Your Memories,"If you have pleasant memories of seeing this movie as a child, leave it that way. You will be sorely disappointed if you rent (let alone buy) this movie. Visually it is very beautiful and it looks like the same animators who did The Hobit. The story is okay and the acting is bearable, but the music is awful!!! This overextended depressing 80s music really ruins it. The best way to enjoy this film is on a poster."
2,Beware of Not Rated,"I would not recommend this video for use in an elementary school classroom. Teachers should preview. Show, only, with parental notification. I found the use of the repeated profanity offensive and totally inappropriate for the young children I teach ( age 4, 5 & 6). I know many individuals assume a NR on a children's animated story, is equivalent to a G. Unfortunately, this is very misleading!"
5,Radiates all the best from my childhood,I watched this at least a dozen times when I was a kid and I could never get past the beauty and wonder of this movie. I have been waiting 15 years for the DVD.
1,"Great movie, awful, censored release!","I've absolutely loved this movie since I was a kid. Watched it so often that I wore out our first VHS copy and we had to buy a second one decades ago.I finally bought the DVD version, excited to at last see it in widescreen, but was shocked when I put it in the DVD player! They went through and censored out all the ""curse words."" It's not as if this was particularly filthy language, just a few stray instances of ""damn"" and ""hell."" These words are heard everyday, even on daytime television--not exactly something you are going to be able to shield anyone from anyway.Knowing the film nearly word for word after all these years, I was horrified that they would put out such a sanitized version. Sickened, really.I'm holding out in the hopes that they will re-release it with the proper, unedited version. Until then, don't waste your money on this version."
1,"Love the story, but the DVD looks *horrible*","This is possibly the worst DVD transfer of a movie I've seen since the orignal release of ""Hunt for Red October"". It's dark, solid colors exhibit shimmer, there's motion blur everywhere and it's *fuzzy*. The VHS version has higher picture quality! The sound is muddy and seems to be mono, though it claims to be 2.0 stereo.I loved this movie as a kid, and I'd recommend this DVD if it didn't look awful. If you can find it, get the German import version - it's region 2, meaning you'll have to have a region-free player, and all the menus are in German. However, it's been fully remastered - sound is 5.1 surround, video is clear and bright. And it's widescreen as well."
2,"Great Movie, Poor Quality Release",I cannot believe this movie was released in such poor condition. it's fully screen only. The audio sounds like a cassette tape. The picture is dark and blurry. There is distortion along the top of the picture. There are no special features whatsoever. Such a tragedy that this great movie was treated like this.
1,Don't buy it here,"Buy it from Conlan Press online for the same price. Or if you want to pay extra you can get a signed copy. Why? Because otherwise the writer of the film will get no proceeds, because the company that orignally made this film (Granada) has been refusing to pay him any royalties for the past 20+ years since the movie came out, and generally treating him horribly. Lionsgate, however, worked out a deal to let him sell some copies through Conlan Press online, so if you buy from there, he'll get a cut."
1,Possibly the worst DVD transfer I've ever seen,"First things first: This is a nice movie for kids, particularly little girls. The story is compelling, though the animation is pretty lousy. The music, written by the estimable Jimmy Webb and sung by America, is quite good. I'd give the movie 3 stars on the whole, 4 stars for a little girl.Now for this particular DVD. It's absolutely attrocious! The picture looks no better than an average VHS cassette. Worse (MUCH worse), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies. It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape. There is no excuse for this, and I've never seen (or heard) a poorer DVD transfer.If you already own this movie on VHS, there's no reason to spend any money to get his version. It's surely no better than the copy you have, and is (because of the soundtrack wow and flutter) arguably worse."
3,Ok..,"My daughter and I prefer the old VHS edition... with the ""damns"" and with the fuzzy animation over this cleaned up version."
5,The last Unicorn movie,"I first saw this movie when It was given to me on my eight birthday by my grandparents. It stole my heart, no sooner had I recieved it had I seen over and over every day. It broke over time, so my mother bought me another. I can still remeber the songs from the movie before I got my second copy. You'll never see a better movie than this if you love fantasy or your kids do.Excert, said by the Unicorn, "" What she calls a manticore looks to be nothing more than a shabby toothless old lion, and she make them believe that poor old ape with a twisted ankle is a satyr. Deception, Illusion, Mirages, your mommy Fortuna can not truly change things...."" written from my memory."
5,Perfect for a little girl...,I watched this movie all the time when I was young. It was my favorite childhood movie. The unicorn and the whole movie just seemed so magical to me. I highly recommend this movie for all children of all ages! An excellent movie.
5,One of the best films of all time,"I can't remember when I first saw this, but I really enjoyed watching every so often, now even after all these years, it still brings a tear to my eyes."
2,The Last Unicorn,This incredible movie deserves so much better. I don't think the people that are releasing the movie understand the devotion of the fans. I've bought the pirated version and it's better than this crap. Artisan. Please step up and give this movie the treatment it needs. Americans have only been waiting years for the release. The audio is unbearably bad as well. It must be a VHS copy.
5,Awsome!,"This was my favorite movie when I was younger. Now I'm in college, and my friends and I are sititng here drinking beer and chilling with ""The Last Unicorn""! I will always love this movie....it will always be a part of me, and it can be a part of you, too!"
1,Eats batteries and min. to start,"I owned this CD-player for 2 days and then returned it. I'm sure mine must have been a lemon, cause they can all be this bad. It took anywhere from 1 to 5 min. before it would play the first song, then after about 8 songs, the batteries went dead. So I put in a new pair, and again 8 to 12 songs later - dead batteries.., it also wouldn't play all the songs on the cd.Even the sound quality was poor!"
1,Worst CD-MP3 player i've seen!!,"D-Link should stick to networking products...the moment i put batteries on this mp3 player, i knew something was really wrong with it...sound quality was horrible, battery life was horrible, skipped all the time, even when i pressed any button, it would reset itself all the time...i give it 1 star because i can't give it any less...DO NOT BUY THIS!!!...i returend it the next day and bought a RIO CD-MP3 player...MUCH MUCH BETTER!!!!!"
1,Blah!,"Me and this MP3 player never seemed to hit it off. It skips everywhere--even in the car--so the music I'm listening to gets interupted left and right. The battery life is horrific, the sound quality is ok, but man, what's the point if you can't walk around with your portable player if it skips? I wouldn't recommend this if you like to actually move around."
1,One of the worst products I have ever owned!,"Not only does D-Link make cheap generic imitations of real network products, but now this. Worst of all they are still in business. The earphones are extremely uncomfortable and it chewed up a 5 dollar pack of Duracell Ultras in less than 1.5 hours and it skips! Welp, you get what you pay for! Thank goodness for my Sony MZR-90 Minidisc with 35 hours of playback and sounds better too!"
1,NOdisc,"I used it for two weeks. but now, i don't know why, I put in a disc (Audio CD or mp3 CD) and the LCD screen shows ""NoDisc""."
5,Forget all others This is the one.,"I paid about $89 for the Genica Taurus MP3 CD player. Let me tell you how big a mistake that was, it was defective, so I returned it and it took them 3 weeks to send me a new one, guess what that was more defective then the 1st.Now for the DLINK. Its da bomb folks. It has bass boost, it charges your batteries with the AC adapter, it lets you enter what MP3 number you want, doesnt skip a whole lot, doesnt drain batteries quickly, its the greatest I have tried. Also its the cheapest at $39 after rebates and amazon coupons.Buy DLINK stay away from GENICA"
3,Ruby Nose Screw,"In general I am pleased with my purchase. It is a ruby and it is 14kt gold however, the picture of the nose screw and what I actually got were not the same. The item I received had the (pigtail?) not the gentle curve of the nose screw pictured."
5,moly this,"4130 tube steel takes to diamond paste for hi luster fine ,moving parts inside tube such as carbon fiber piston}"
1,"Yet another version, another vocalist.","The sound musically is good. That's the only reason I give it one star. But for the vocals no stars. If you don't care who sings, then buy it. I regret buying this cd, because the vocals don't appeal to me. Take advantage of the ""Listen to"" songs when available. Unfortunately on this cd that option is not available. But many others do have it."
3,DeFore Saves This Story,"This film noir was turning out to be a disappointment but picked up the pace nicely with some interesting twists when Don DeFore's character ""Don Blake"" entered the storyMeanwhile, Lizabeth Scott (""Jane Palmer"") was convincing as the femme fatale and Dan Duryea (""Danny Fuller"") was his normal entertaining character complete with some good, wisecracking lines. However, DeFore is the guy who rally snaps this film out of the doldrums.This is a story of greed and what it can do to people, particularly if they aren't that moral to begin with!It's nice to see this out on DVD, although, from what I have read everywhere, there hasn't been a decent print of this movie made available, at any price.....so beware."
1,excellent movie..horrible quality,"does anyone know which vender offers the ""best"" copy of this Lizabeth Scott Fem-Fattell movie? It's a great movie as I'm a noir buff who has stuff on Beta, VHS, and DVD... parts are(scenes) are missing so is dialogue....The video quality is abysmal.... HELPPP please!!!!!"
2,I think i'll pass........,"For the price, Image should have put out a better quality print than what was used in this disc. You can see this same print on a dvd called ""Film Noir Triple Feature Vol. 1"". This film has an alternate title of ""KILLER BAIT"" which is available as a better quality print in a 6 disc set called ""5 Film Noir Killer Classics"". I'm so glad that i was able to rent this disc through the mail FIRST. The movie is good as far as content goes. I think i'll pass on this transfer of it, though."
2,"Good Film, Terrible DVD","Too Late For Tears is a decent film and for fans of Film Noir, it is a real kick. Lizabeth Scott leaves a trail of dead bodies, lies and deceit that is classic noir. She could have used better direction, but the film still holds up.That said, this new release from the Image ""Dark City"" collection is so technically awfull, it is an example of outright fraud. At this price, to release such a poor transfer with sound like this constitues ""Grand Theft Video"". No effort has been made to clean-up any part of the film. You might expect this from a $2.00 Garage Sale purchase, but not from a new release. It looks like a simple copy of the horrid Alpha release.If you like Film Noir, please join me in wrting Image Entertainment to let them know how offended you are by this flim-flam tactic. Enough Said."
1,not too late for tears,"This is the worst quality DVD we have ever received and have already sent it back for a refund. It was obviously taped from TV with annoying cuts and missing footage. The overall quality was abysmal. We rent and buy lots of older films and this is the worst one we have EVER gotten. Whoever packaged this should be ashamed. In addition, the title was misspelled on the package (to instead of too). That should have been a tip off to the quality of the DVD."
4,Great Film Noir - Terrible DVD Transfer,"David Forehand's review is perfectly stated, and I cannot add anything more to it, other than I would give this film only 4 stars due to the terrible quality of the DVD transfer. The copy I watched is produced by Alpha Video Recorders, and is the very worst I have seen.But the film noir is terrific, and I am glad to have been able to see it, even though the transfer is so bad. If this is the only way we can get this 1949 classic, then it is worth the low cost of the film."
3,Really a 3.5,"This is a surprisingly good movie. Nice story and good, brisk pace. Lizabeth Scott is awesome as the femme fatale.To get a four, the physical quality of the picture would have had to have been better. I've no problem with B&W;, but the print was not great.To get a five, the supporting actors would have to have been better and more interesting. This is something of a Scott vehicle."
1,the movies was OKbut the copy was TERRIBLE,It looked like several generations from a scratched old film master. The worst copy of an older movie I have EVER seen -- and I'm pretty tolerant because I love old films that were produced much earlier than this (and were much better copies).
1,Fabulous Lizabeth Scott Noir Ruined By Horrid Transfer,"This is an excellent film noir, with the classic cold-as-ice femme fatale played by the fantastic Lizabeth Scott. Too bad the transfer is horrid - key dialogue fades in and out, skips like a bad record, and over-contrasted picture settings that leave little, if anything, to be seen in the important opening sequences. One plus about this release is the knowledgable special features on Dangerous Dan and Lizabeth....these are great! Too bad such a fine film has such a muddy (as-in-I-filmed-it-from-a-drive-in-in-the-backseat-on-my-mobile-phone) quality to it. A real disappointment."
3,good movie bad transfer.,"This is a great noir film,but the alpha video transfer is terrible. The scenes are pieced together sloppily and the quality is terrible! I could not believe how bad (by today's standards) they could sell this poor of quality on DVD,but the plot of the movie is great with Lizabeth Scott and Dan Duryea acting superbly."
4,How does one rate this properly?,A great film noir with superb performances by noir icons Scott and Duryea is hopelessly mangled in a really bad dvd transfer. The film is 5 star but the transfer is just terrible................recommended with obvious reservations.
3,"Good film noir, but Alpha Video version is very shoddy print","Beware. There are two (maybe more) versions of this film on DVD. The Alpha Video release of this is a really shoddy print, with video jumps and skips all over the place. There is dialogue for which you only hear the tail end of a number of times; this is really irritating.The film itself is a solid decent effort; Dan Duryea and Lizabeth Scott are fine, and the standard film noir story of a femme fatale, greed, money, and murder is carried out with aplomb by the two leads, with no thanks/help from Don DeFore as the good guy who is just too goofy to be credible. Arthur Kennedy is OK too, as is Kristine Miller. But naturally, the movie belongs to Duryea and Scott.From what I understand, the Image print is not too great either. Not sure; haven't seen it. But the Alpha Video print is definitely a must to avoid. The reason I gave this three stars is because the movie itself is, as mentioned, pretty good. Too bad about the lousy print, though."
2,nothing is what it seems to be,"The product does not worth the price,and the texture of it is too thick.It's definitly not a day cream because the way it looks on your face, unless you don't mind going out there looking all green;and is unconfourtable to sleep with because it's also sticky.I'm sorry but that's how it is."
1,terrible,I'm totally disappointed. I trusted the review on this product. This is like a candle. It's not watery and different from other products in a weired way...i feel like putting a paraffin on my skin.
3,Prompt delivery - good quality product - velcro useless,"The product was delivered promptly. Dashmat seems to be of good quality and color was as ordered. However, the velcro strips that came with it to attach the mat to the dashboard are absolutely useless - the adhesive side does not stick to the dashboard."
4,The District has something different,"I've been waiting for a band like this to come along for a while.I caught these guys in Chicago a few weeks ago, and wow!The ld singer gave me the CD free 'cause he was too drunk to make change. But not too drunk to put on one of the best vocal performances I have ever seen or heard. These guys are the real deal. They reminded me of Springsteen and E street. Someone needs to take a look at these guys and give them a shot.Buy this CD, you won't want to take it out of the car.And some of their new songs they highlighted really puts them out there, electric blue grass, soul, rock and roll, these guys have it all."
1,Ugly Latina Girls Flashing saggy mammals,"when you advertise a DVD as ""Latina Girls Going Crazy"" I expecta marathon of gorgeous, exotic looking latina girls getting nakedat a club in the street in a motel at a spring break resort etcThis piece of garbage is half hour of either ugly or fat girls showing their either saggy or flat chested tops, again none ofthem are doing nothing crazy except just flashing their tops& the rest of the half hour is about 2 gilrs in a motel room just kissing & touching each other, neither one gets nakeddont say u weren't warned. I pay $5.00 for this crap & its still too expensive"
5,Essential Music From The Best,"If you were stranded on an island and could only take one Elvis cd with you this would be the perfect one.There is not a bad song on this cd and it is a good and pleasant listening mix of all of his music.You get the blues,rock,rockabilly,gospel,movies,and some live concert music.One of the best arrangements of songs of all the cds that have been released since his untimely death.If you grew up listening to Elvis music it will bring back so many memories and if you are just getting acquainted with his music you will be pleased and will build happy memories.Not a bad price.Buy it,play it once and you will not want to play anything else for a long time.You will be hooked.This cd brings to mind what all the fuss was about."
5,Elvis Rules,This 2 disc CD is wonderful! We have listened to it several times and it never gets old. The song selection is wide range and covers everything from sentimental to romance to rock! I would recommend this to everyone!!
5,Happy Birthday&Great collection,"I've always Dug Elvis Presley. this is a Great Introduction collection a Double set that is on point. Suspicious Minds is My Favorite Presley song to this day. these Songs still hold up so well&Elvis's voice is the main reason. he left a distinctive impression with how he presented his take on songs. i already have Elvis collections,but this One is a very Good. a Must have."
4,Nostalgic sound,"There's a smaller percentage of people alive who listened to Elvis during his peak popularity so I guess the sales are falling off by now. We bought this for the nostalgia of it. The recordings are very clear considering that the original source had to be old reel to reel magnetic tape, not as flat sounding as some of the pre 1970's music."
1,Skips,"Bought this CD...enjoyed it about 3 weeks, then it started skipping...returned for a exchange and the second one did the same thing...."
3,Very good book but there are too many coincidences.,"I am a 12 year old boy who read this book in class (6th grade) in France. I liked it a lot. However, there were too many coincidences: for example, when the eldest sister is in the crowd of people fighting for food and she blindly grabs someone who turns out to be her long lost brother. What are the chances of that happening! However, it was a touching story."
4,the silver sword by linda,"When i first heard the silver sword was a war book,i thoughtit wouldn`t be so good but it is.It`s about a girl called Ruthand her brother Edek , her sister Bronia and a boy called Jantrying to find there mum and dad in Swizerland.Ian serrailleris a good author he has good ideas and a wonderful imagination.He describes words exelently although he sometimes does boringsentences.The silver sword can have some good parts and somebad parts but theres some bad parts like when they where in theriver and they were going down stream it got dull and boringbut it got more exiting.I would recommed this book to 9-12 children because i know they would like it."
4,The Silver Sword,"The Author is Ian Serraillier an it's published by Puffin.The story is about a family that is seperated during the war and Joseph goes looking for his wife in Switzerland and a few years later the children go looking for there parents they are Ruth,Edek,Bronia and they find a kind helping follower that has got no parents and that is Jan.Jan is my favourite character cause he is daring.Ruth is my least favourite character cause all she does is just and worry.My favourite bit is when Jan gives Bistro the chimp a cigar.The least favourite bit is when the boat crash's.I would reccomend it to all ages from 5 to 13 year olds."
1,silver sword,I HAVE JUST READ THE SILVERSWORD BY IAN ASTRAILIA PUBLISHED BY GOOGLE I LIKED IT BECAUSE THE MONKEY WAS SMOKING AND MY LEAST FAVOURITE PART WAS WHEN THEY WAS ON THE ROAD THE BOOK GOT PRETY BOARING AT THE END BECAUSE THE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED IT WAS GOOD AT THE AT
2,It was a touch light hearted,"This book was good apart from the fact that it skimmed over the surface of the storie too much, there were also too many coinsidences that happened in it."
1,Let down,"I bought this model last month; was excited about the ""triple sensor"" features. It is a let down! It's basically good for just telling time.The compass settings were off; had to be recalibrated manually.The barometer readings don't help much in predicting the weather... The manual go back and forth on its usefulness.The altimeter readings are useless; they have to be recalibrated every time you change altitudes significantly.The thermometer is accurate -- but only if aren't wearing the watch for 30 minutes!The countdown timer goes up only to 60 minutes.The backlight doesn't have the ""stay on"" feature that Timex indiglo watches have. So, when you are trying to make settings to the watch in the dark, you are constantly interrupted by the fact the the light goes off after 2.5 seconds. Timex watches are smart enough to keep the light on if you are pressing other buttons."
3,Correcting Michael's Error,"Michael, you've mixed up your movies. ""Living Free"" is NOT the film that was advertised with a Cary Grant glasses clad lion, THAT movie was ""Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion,"" and indeed, it was influenced by television's DAKTARI.The theme from ""Living Free"" did NOT win the Academy Award, nor was it even nominated; ""Born Free,"" the film to which ""Living Free"" is a sequel has the distinction of containing John Barry's Oscar winning song."
3,VHS,The quality of the picture is not good but watchable.CanIster get it in dvd format?It was s good movie to watch.Only wish the pictures were better definition
5,Nick Carter's Favorite Book,"This was an excellent movie. It is Nick Carter of the BSB's favorite book. I would definitely recommed it to everyone, unless you are an N Sync fan."
2,"Great for the BIG picture, not so much detailed.","We bought this map thinking it would help us navigate around town (Cusco) and Machu Picchu, since it is pictured on the cover. Not so much. It seems ok for long distance stuff and maybe if you are driving on your own, not so much for walking. For our needs, it was almost worthless."
5,Heartfelt and brave,This book is heartfelt and brave and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Stacy Lewis is an amazingly wise and gifted person. And Java is an amazing being in a dog's body! The two of them were destined to meet to inspire all of us to be more conscious in our relationships.
2,Java: The True Story of a Shelter Dog Who Rescued a Woman,"FUN to read and some sage wisdom, but really a pitch for Tellington TTouch method of training a dog. A sweet story but shoul have been 150 pages instead of 231, cut out all the fluff/filler. If it had concentrated on the main GREAT character, JAVA now that would have been a five star rating!"
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I just started reading JAVA last night, I could not put it down. It's been a long time since a book has been able to make me laugh and cry and totally escape!! I am a dog owner ofcourse so that is the great part, Stacy shares her relationship with her beauty Java and also relates to her own self as a human and how in life we go through many paths and she uses introspect through her relatinoship and experience with Java to depict this very thing! The way the book is written lures you in and makes you think of lots of different things. Even non dog owners I feel would love and learn a lot from this book. I highly recommend it, it's great! WEll done STacy and Java!"
5,Great Read,"""JAVA: The True Story of a Shelter Dog Who Rescued a Woman"" is a very compelling autobiography about how adopting a dog from a shelter and going in the direction life was nudging her (rather than digging her heels in trying to stay put) changed the life of Stacy Lewis in positive and unimaginable ways. Through trying to find help for her very scared and reactive dog Java, Stacy embraces a new career path, new home, new friends and a new lease on life. The story shows how opening ones self up to new possibilities and saying ""yes"", can help a person create a life that is more full than they could have come up with on their own. A good book for animal lovers, life lovers and those who would like to learn how to love life."
3,plastic but Ok,This prop works OK but it is made of plastic and you have to be very careful that you dont drop it or hit stumps in the water. It has a slot for the pin to go through the shaft so make sure you do not over tighten the nut because you will crack the plastic on the prop.I think these props are over priced for what you get.
5,great addition to Barney collection,"If your kid is hooked on Barney, this CD will contain a lot of songs that are in the Barney videos. My daughter recognizes the songs and grunts along, very interactive! Because she is hooked on Barney, we need to have him on TV, in the car and all the time, so this is the CD we play while we are in the bathtub. Her favorites are the ""raindrop song"" (ah-ah-ah she goes!), the yum-yum song and the ""clapping song"". Anything that makes her happy in the bathtub wins points with me. Thanks, Barney!"
4,I would buy this for my nieces..,"The track listing on here is fairly good, with Steve Vai, James Brown, and many other popular performers (hopefully after hearing these musicians, my nieces will begin to find less worthy children's ""music"" such as Kidz Bop as musically tedious and unsatisfying as the rest of my family does, and I admit that, even as a 27 year old woman I have recently found myself tuning into Radio Disney (to become familiar with and ""hip to"" what my nieces like and listen and actually enjoying much of what I hear. Much of what is on this CD and channel appeals to adults and children alike, making them so much better than so much other ""family"" music. I recommend this to anyone who has kids in their lives, as this music remains totally appropriate, but is not watered-down ""kiddie"" music that talks down musically to your kids."
5,great dancing CD,"this is a CD you can dance to. it's a real energy boost, and everyone can listen to it. a real treat for former viewers of ""the all new mickey mouse club"" is that there is a song by the group MMC on there. (also a treat for 'n sync fans, since JC Chasez sings lead on that song) very good CD"
1,HANSON jams on Radio Disney Kid Jams,"I purchased Radio Disney Kid Jams only because Hanson's song River is on it!! I only gave it one star because there's only 1 Hanson song on it and there should be more! Maybe you think I'm being unfair, maybe you think that I'm a diehard fan, well, 1. I'm not being unfair because Hanson is the best band in the world and 2. I AM a diehard fan!! YEAH! Okay, BYE!"
2,The above review is not a review,What garbage! If you are going to have customer reviews such as the one posted above then make sure that is what they are instead of allowing biased political statements.
5,Let's hear more from these artists,The Retelling of Dreams is the most mesmerizing music I have heard in a very long time. I hope more cds will be coming along shortly.
5,Born Free,"Once again a very awesome family film. Everyone can enjoy this film without exception. It covers love, inner strengths, patience and remarkable friendships that are hard to find now a days."
3,Born Free (1965),"I just thought it be more of the wild life, opposed to a movie itself. I was playing it for my little one because she likes to watch movies, or documentaries that include animals, it was not what I thought it was."
5,Born Free,Excellent movie to watch with friends and family. We enjoyed it thoroughly. Kids will like it as well as adults.
5,Elsa,I loved this film just as much as I did when I first watched it as a young girl. I even showed it to a group of teenagers and they were completely captivated.
5,Great Film,A classic movie that is still as good as when it was filmed. I enjoyed watching this film with my family and I think you will too.
4,"Great Film, Price too High",Thought the movie was great but way over priced. Never again. I'm switching back to Netflix. You would get more purchases if the prices were more reasonable.
4,BORN FREE,I saw this as a child. I liked the movie then and I like it now. I have learned so much of the history of the story and the actors and the real George and Joy Adamson. The continued story including Christian the lion. This story has impacted 6 people deeply. I have been humming the theme song all month. Get this movie and introduce it to another generation of young people. EnjoyableDebra Envall
5,Excellent movie,"Saw this movie when it first came out in the early '60s. Quality of the DVD is very good. It's what made me love the big cats and I've loved and respected them ever since. If I could, I'd devote my life to them as George and Joy Adamson did."
4,BORN FREE,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, THE QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE,BUT ITS GREAT TO WATCH AFTER ALL THESE YEARS"
2,Not Bad,The product is not bad and does the job. But for the price its not really worth it. Its very bulky in size and hard to put up and then put away.
4,Nice if you're VERY petite,A very attractive bra but only if you are on the small side of B! I had to send it back =(
4,An excellent choice for fans of Matsuo Basho and/or haiku,"Lesley Downer retraces Matsuo Basho's famed 17th century journey to unknown northern Japan documented in his book ""On the Narrow Road to the Deep North."" Ms. Downer rediscovers a ""lost"" Japan. The journey and the writing are well worth the effort."
5,Great book.. reflects how Japanese works.,"Ok, first of all, you *must* learn hiragana & katakana to use this book. I recommend getting James Heisig's book on learning both.That said, this book jumps right into Japanese, and assumes you will *work* to learn the language. Each chapter, assuming you do the exercises will take several days. But they are well worth it.One great thing this book does is use realistic Japanese conversational structures. Most books use convoluted (to the japanese ear) but educational (to the learner) sentences. This book always presents a ""typical"" japanese construct (as well as the more educational styles).One disappointing thing with this book is that I have not been able to locate the tapes that go with it. Other than that, this is a great book to learn japanese with (tho you have to be willing to work hard!)"
4,"Too easy on Kanji, has a pitch tone.","I won't repeat other reviewers.Overall, it's a good textbook. Apart from missing audio, I am not too happy about many Japanese textbooks about being too slow on introducing Kanji. Why not write in Kanji all the words that are NORMALLY written in Kanji and provide Hiragana like for the Kanji that are used? A full-fledged Japanese text has much more Kanji that in textbooks, the authors seem to ""spare"" learners. The kanji should be used both in the main text and the vocabulary list, in my opinion.Another good feature (I think most people missed that in the review), the text describes the pitch tone very well and uses accents to show the standard pitch accent throughout the book. Most textbooks ignore the Japanese pitch accent, as if it's unimportant. It would be, of course, ideal to hear these accents in action."
4,Best Japanese Learning Book on the Market,"The most comprehensive book available. It teaches you to read Japanese script, a cruial step no other book incorporates well. Two drawbacks: the occasional inclusion of new vocabulary without explanation, and the unavailability of the accompanying tapes. Fair warning, though -- it is a rigorous course, and one best done with a tutor -- and a classmate."
3,Japanese for serious students only,"This is definitely not Japanese for everyone. If you are very serious about learning Japanese and have lots of time and dedication, then this may be the book for you. Each lesson is crammed with new concepts and exercises and could take a week or more to work through. The book uses Romanji (English alphabet) only in the first three lessons and expects you to learn the Japanese phonetic scripts (hirogana and katakana) on your own. While this is possible, it takes real effort. Moreover, it slows down considerably the understanding of the structure of the language. Unless you are dedicated to learning written Japanese, it would be better to use a text that uses at least a mixture of English and Japanese script."
