1,OH BROTHER!,"I can't believe people buy this junk.These girls can not sing.They are just some other disney channel wanna be stars who can't sing worth a penny.If you look up to these girls as idols you are just another sucker.If you're just like this""oh, aly & aj inspired me to play the guitar"" you'r just another dumb no life bum.These girls aren't what u call singers.When they supposedly ""sing"" you can't even understand a word they say.Don't get me wrong, i'm not racist.My best friend is white.However if this was a black girl singing about ""out of your soul race through your veins"" they'd wanna say their demonized.The only thing thes girls prove is that you don't have to be a good singer to get a record deal. P.S. Aj has a nose like a clown,they aren't pretty.Just pretty UGLY!"
1,there goes the music business,"what is hapenning to music?people must not have good tatse.me and my friend lauren can't stand these girls.the first time i saw them on disney channel i mated to bust my tv with a metal baseball bat.if you hate aly & aj you're not the only one.no girl at our school likes al & aj.aly stinks at whatever she does.especially that disney show phil of the future.it was a good show.i wish they hadn't cancelled it,but aly made me not like it.if you have sense you won't buy this waste of money."
3,It's OK,"I'm actually a little surprise that this got so many good reviews. Sure, Aly and AJ are good singers and have wonderful voices. But after a while, their songs start getting kind of old because all of them have a pop background and I get tired of hearing their voices singing in the same way over and over again. This album is just so-so."
5,OK I Admit it,"Usually I don't really like Disney people albums, but these two girls are very talented and pretty. They have a bright future ahead of them if people realize that they're wonderful singers. Not only that, but I also applaud the creative songs that they sing in the album. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Buy this Cd!,This cd was great! My favorite song is Rush. It has a rocky edge to it! i would recomend this cd to Hilary Duff fans! Don't pass this up!
5,how did you and your sister start singing together,how did you and your sister aj start singing together what age did you guys start
2,'Rush' about drugs?,"I've heard a few of their songs, but Rush took me by surprise. I went searching for the lyrics and, when read normally, are very...different from what most people may interpret. to be honest, the lyrics to 'Rush' read like they're describing the affect of drugs or even an orgasm! Don't believe me? Go ahead, look it up, I double dog DARE you.Sincerely,Someone who's actually 18."
3,Average,"OK, not great. Worth the discounted price, but I would not pay the full price. Most of the songs are the same ones that are on the radio so there was not anything new in the CD"
4,SIERRA,"I love this album. ""Do you believe in Magic"" is my favorite song. I would highly recommend that you buy this album."
4,Basic Pop at its GREATEST!,"""Into The Rush"" by Aly & AJ, was just a wonderful pop album. I heard the album late this year and I wasn't expecting all that much because since one of the girls are from disney. This album overexceeded my expectations! I was very pleased with the songs on this album and not that many fillers at all. My favorite and stand-out track on it is ""Speak For Myself"". If you want to hear some new true pop artists, buy this album! I highly recommend it to any pop music fan. Hope they have continued success in the future because these girls are the future of pop."
4,Great!! Better than Hilary!,"I love this cd! In my opinion its better than Hilary duff. Their songs, which they wrote themselves, are about real topics and not just about 'he broke my heart or i went to the club and danced forever i was like boom' you know what i mean it has more meaning and it is ispiring, at least to me. But what do i know i am just 15. Its great get it!! Tell your friends!! Get it for your kids or friends!!"
5,buen disco,este disco es bueno las dos cantan bien aunque se parece un poco la voz a hilary duff pero eso no importa las canciones son muy buenas compren este disco no se van a arrepentir esta muys suave
5,awesome cd!!!!,"I got this cd as soon as it came out! I got mine at Walmart though, and it's different than the one on this site. My tracks are in a different order and on my DVD, it only has Chemicals React video, the SIMS Chemicals React, and the Rush music video. I didn't get On the Ride and that doesn't seem right to have different kinds of the cd out. Other than that, this cd ROCKS!!!!!"
5,how I envy their composing! Brilliant!,"""Wow. Oh my...wow."" These are the thoughts that were going through my mind when I first listened to the whole CD of ""Into the Rush"" by Aly & AJ. It's really cool to think that two girls only a little older than I can really make this kind of music. It's awe inspiring. Honestly. I agree with Eri (Hong Kong), she really summed it up in her review. All I want to add, is that when you listen to this kind of music, it kind of lifts your heart up, raises your spirits, and it just makes you feel like suddenly, so many more things are possible.That probably sounds cheesy, doesn't it? Isn't it weird how something so cheesy, can be so true?? Please, at least listen to this CD. I'm telling the truth when I say that it is awesome!!"
4,Surprised!,"I've seen the one girl on Phil of the Future and when I saw her video...i was thinking ""another Disney actor trying to be singer."" But, I was pleasently surprised by the album, and the fact that they play guitars and write their own songs. That's something to respect, so props to Aly and AJ. We dont need ANYMORE Hilarys and Lindseys running around."
5,So talented,"I love ally and aj! They rock. Every time I am in my room with my cats, they always bob their heads.My little sister will wake up every morningand say I want to listen to all and aj.Anyway they are very talented and have a great gift."
5,Aly and AJ are very good,"I originally bought this CD because I heard their song Rush was good, but it was better than good, it was awsome. They have great voices. My only complaint is that many of the songs sound alike or have the same theme."
2,looks cute but poor workmanship,"this hat is really adorable, but when i put it on, the top edge of one side sticks out much more than the other. no matter how i tried to adjust it, it looked ridiculous. also, customer service was not great. i returned it stating it was a defective item, and he charged me a restocking fee and did not refund shipping. i had even taken photos to show the defect and emailed them, but still no response. so i finally called him to complain (the owner answered directly) and he refunded the rest. i'm not sure that i would shop from here again."
5,"Excellent instructions, beautiful designs","I have owned this book for at least 20 years, probably more. Lately, I have a renewed interest in Bargello and it is just as informative as the first time I used it."
4,Canon 52mm snap on lens cap,"Does what it is advertised to do, nothing more nothing less. It snaps on easy, even with a uv filter in place, and comes off easy. It's a bit easy to misplace though."
5,Enter the Snap-on Lens Cap,"I am the proud owner of a Canon Powershot S1 IS, and it comes with the pop-off tethered grey lens cap. That thing annoys me to no end. First, it pops off. Lame. Second, it has a tether, which is forever getting in my way, no matter what I attach it to. It was time for a change: enter the E-52U Snap On Lens Cap.Now, this doesn't fit the S1 IS lens all by itself, which initially made my stomach feel like I had left it on top of the refrigerator and I had jumped down. However, you can remove the lens ring, attach the 52mm extension tube, and then snap this puppy right on the end. It stays in place, and there's no annoying tether to get in my way.This was just what I needed."
5,Bought for SX40,"Bought for my SX40, fits perfect. Fits better than the original which may have fallen off and got lost. I'll probably buy another as a spare."
5,It works!,"A bit on the expensive side, but it is a genuine Canon cap. I lost my original cap a decade ago, while at Yosemite Park, and bought a generic replacement. It was the right size but kept falling off at all times, especially with my camera in a bag, so it was not really protecting the lens.I finally lost the replacement a week ago, so I bought two of these, to be safe rather than sorry, but it is clear I really only needed one. It snaps on and it holds its position. If I lose this one, it will be because I will have misplaced it, not because I will have accidentally knocked it off the lens (or actually the UV filter screwed on the lens).Some would say all caps were created equal, but if so, this one is much more equal than the others. A perfect cap, well worth the extra cost!"
4,Canon strikes your pocket!,"I always take an extra Cap in my bag for my lenses. Just in case you lose the one on the lens, it's not really worth damaging your lens, or probably even your filter. Some caps that come with filter sets are 'usable' on the canon lenses / protective filters, but often they just fit better when used with the filter they came with, so i tend to shy away from this approach experimentally. I would like to see a 3 or 4 way cap with that many tabs, so when you brush it, it doesn't just come off, but of course this might make it harder to take off than is desirable.Summary:+ Fits properly.- Cost (should be at most $4 MSRP).- No 'cap keeper' included."
5,Rendezvous,"For anyone who has been to Paris and, perhaps, secretly desires to tear around city streets at 160+ m/h in a Ferrari about 5:00 A.M. Format must have clarity of effect is lessened, but still, a kick in the pants. If you don't like this, check your pulse and sell your bed."
5,Remember to Breath,"I was 10 years old when I saw `Rendezvous' for the first time. It was 1981 and my father brought it home on a 16mm projector version, and showed it on the family slide projector screen. As a kid I was truly blown away, and as an adult I am still astonished by this work. Truthfully, I feel that anyone who has seen these nine breathtaking minutes of amazing footage will be left with an indelible mark in his or her mind. I was very excited to see that this was finally out on DVD after so many years, and although it is not available here at Amazon, it is available for purchase over at speedtv.com. I would highly recommend this wonderful Claude Lelouche work for anyone who enjoys a fast paced chase scene, or just the thrill of seeing beautiful European shops, avenues and cobblestone streets fly by at more than 100 mph. Most Hollywood cinematic features that involve an element such as this only wish they could emulate it with such reality, for reality is what `Rendezvous' truly is."
2,View only with a mega screen with mega sound system,I saw this short short film - years ago at a theatre. At that time this short was a as prelude to a feature length film and it was unique at that time and thus enjoyable. Recently I this film on video on both a regular 27 inch TV and wide screen TV connected to a powerful audio system. If you do not have the wide screen TV and great audio system do not bother. The quality of this film is quite poor compared to the crystal clear clarity of most Claude Lelouch films. Plus it just does not work on the small screen. Bigger the viewing and hearing platform that more enjoyable the viewing. Au Revoir!
5,"need big screen, yes! dvd version ever?",i agree with all the other reviews that you need to see this on a big screen with a good sound system.i am hoping that one day it might get released on dvd. i can only hope.
5,One to see before you die,"I had heard about this film but could never find it, it was worth the wait though as this is amazing. It doesn't matter what you believe about the car or the driver or the legends, this film is fantastic and should be seen by every motorhead! Speed camera, anyone?"
3,Too much Drift,"Not a bad book, for a general overview of what happened at Rorke's Drift. However, too much of the book is background information, as only about one-half the book is about the actual battle. For the best book about Rorke's Drift, I recommend ""The Washing of the Spears"". Also, the movie ""Zulu"" is an accurate, (for Hollywood), portrayal of the battle."
4,Interesting,"I found the work overall to be well worth reading. The only downisdes, such as they were, was the the book as a whole was just a bit too light for my taste. Lisane seems to be a typical teen aged sort of person, with roughly typical teen sort of problems - most people aren't destined by birth to rule and don't have to worry about their race being enslaved by interstellar pirates.Most of the ending of the book seems very rushed. The beginning and mid points flow well, then suddenly everything happens and gets quickly wrapped up. There are a dozen hints in the end of the book that could be further developed without cluttering the ending of the story unnecessarily.But overall the book is certainly not a typical fantay novel, and is certainly worth reading."
4,Cool Stuff,"_Nameless Magery_ is a humorous, light-hearted fantasy. Lisane, the funny and quirky heroine, is powerful and interesting, and the supporting characters were each fascinating--particularly Kaihan, who is the enigmatic wizard-king in whom Lisane meets her match. The concept of magic is interesting, and the world-building is well done."
4,A very compelling discovery!,"I got this book from the publishers at a Sci-Fi Fantasy convention. It was the best gift I received there! I am drawn to books in this, and all genres, with compelling, strong female characters. Lisane born a goddess, made an urchin by circumstance, was everything I could want in a female lead. She was strong, sure and unsure at the same time, arrogant enough to get things done, and caring enough to bring others along as she discovers her new world, and how to save it. The plot was exciting, it's twists unexpected, and delightful. I'd like to find a dozen more just like it!"
1,uggghhh...,"When I read the summary at the end of the book, it all seemed really exciting. It had everything: magic,""one true mage"", queen-turned-peasant... Yup. Then I read it... Nope. There was no plot. Rather, a bunch of events that don't even tie together nicely at the end. Ms. Turner also added some scenes that contributed SQUAT to the book. In my opinion, she could have done so much better. Look at the characters she had, they were great! If only she had developed the characters better. If only half the book wasn't made up of sexual hype that didn't contribute to the book. If only..."
4,R-rated,"All of the other reviewers commented on how great the book is, but they skip how parts of this book are pretty R-rated."
3,Average,"I bought this book based on the excellent reviews I read here. I was mildly entertained but the characters would have been interesting if they were better developed. For example, the character Detter clearly had reason to be disturbed. She wrote about his masochistic behavior without really delving into the reasons for it. I did not warm up to any of the characters and I also grew annoyed with the supposedly major crises which were resolved within pages. Not the worst book I've read but not worth the hype. I suspect she can do better."
1,I'm kind of surprised...,"... that the reviews here are so overwhelmingly positive. I guess I must have missed something in my reading of the book, because I really didn't enjoy it.I read this book several years ago, in high school; I am, admittedly, a little fuzzy on the plot now. I do, however, clearly remember the details of the heroine's sex life, probably because these were (as I recall) paid more attention than the plot. I have nothing against sex scenes, really, but I thought they were kind of gratuitous and got in the way. I also remember the plot not making much sense, and the heroine being kind of annoying and not really the awesome strong feminist character the author clearly wants her to be seen as.All that said, I really liked the chapter titles."
1,Terrible,"I read the excerpt and than thinking it showed promise, took it out of the library. All I can say is that it was horrible. The heroine was shallow and insipid, and the frequent references to sexual themes offensive and vulgar. This is not a worthwhile book to read!"
3,"Good Story line, but what's next?","The story was good, and the characters well developed, but what happens next? Also, more needs to be said about the Enforcers. I wouldn't recomend it to everyone, but i did enjoy it!"
2,Not impressed,"Ok I read the back of this book and was interested cause it sounded good. Well I read it and I must say that I was very unimpressed. I thought that Lisane was kind of a flaky character, and I thought that her background wasn't as throughly explained as is could have been. It also seemed that the author, I don't know, got tired of writng at the end of the book. It was like she just wanted to end the book and so she just lumped everything together in the last chapter and ended it. Everything happend at once and then it was over. And ever that was left kinda vauge in some points. All in all I found it unentertaining and I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Keep Looking,"I bought 6 books on purchasing a business via Amazon. This is the only one that is not worth looking at. While Mr. Yegge might be a nice fellow, he desperately needs an editor. His opinions are overbearing and presented in such a confusing manner as to undermine any worth at all.To add insult to injury, Mr. Yeggie keeps stating that it is necessary to purchase his other book if you want to value a company. It would have been easy to include it here -- the other five books I read did just that.I don't know that I could write any better -- but there are a lot of authors out there who can.Cheers"
5,Well worth the price,"First of all this set is a steal when one dvd costs $20.00 it does not take a genius to know your getting three movies for the price of one.I love all the movies in this set how could any John Hughes fan not love them.What memories these movies bring back and I love ""getting the cast together"" on the Ferris Buller dvd. It was great to see the cast after all this time only Mia Sara and Charlie Sheen were not in the recent interviews."
5,Good Work!,This doll is a very nice one. It looks real cool and it's a must-buy. My friends have been amazed with the way it swims. It's sooooo sweeeeet! Keep up the wonderful work Mattel.
4,barbie really swims!,"my daughter loves barbie, especially this one when it is bathtime. barbie actually really does swim,and my daughter truely enjoys it. barbie has taken alot of baths and is still in great shape."
2,Not the Champion........,"My cousin got this toy for her 3rd Birthday,And at first she was thrilled(she is a huge fan of barbie and she is taking swim lessons),Untill she got it out of the box...You see,the arms spin around like she's really swimming when you wind them up from the back,So when you put her in water she swims.......But after spinning the arms severl times it broke,and she was left with a rotten barbie,she couldn't dress it in any clothe besides her swim-suit because of the thing to wind her up in the middle of her back,and that also makes it IMPOSSIBLE to dress her even in the clothes made especially for her........This Barbie is not worth the money,buy something else that girls can actually enjoy,not leave it in a pile of other toys that don't work like they should..................."
2,Good enough,"This 1909 biography of the ""Father of Modern Missions"" is good enough for the facts of Carey's life and works, but the book's late-Victorian style is rather stiff, assumes the reader knows most of the story already, and drops tons of names without explaining who they are. Ah well, for a free Kindle book ya get what ya pay for. ;-)"
3,Definitely BARBIE as Dorothy,"This doll doesn't really look like Judy Garland; she's definitely BARBIE as Dorothy. Very cute, but in my opinion, her hair is too thick to look nice in those braids."
3,"Nice Barbie, but.........","I have 2 issues with the Barbie's I have encountered through my 6 year old daughter: (1) Many of the dolls that cross over into the collectible realm seem to be geared to being kept in the box; their hair becomes easily knotted, shoes fall off, tiny ribbons in their hair come untied as soon as you play with them once, etc.; and (2)what happened to Barbie's underwear??? Some of them have painted-on underwear, but others, like Dorothy have none. Is this a function of cost-cutting or poor costume design?That said, Dorothy is a pretty nice doll, especially for occasional gentle play. She sits happily on the shelf with Toto and Glinda when no one's playing with her."
3,disappointed,I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter as she was Dorothy for Halloween and loves Barbie dolls. I was glad I had it shipped to my house as the batteried were corroded and the ruby slippers would not light up. I replaced the battery and they did work. I was very disappointed at the price I pay for this item as it should have came with functioning battery to begin with.
5,Great CD,"I usually don't comment on CD's but this is an exceptional CD.I bought the CD a few years ago, in LA, at the Wiskey A-Go-Go, after seeing them live.Simply, it is one of my all time favorite CD's.Just buy it!"
2,Trailer......unplugged!,"I haul a boat, enclosed utility and a snowmobile trailer and need this adapter for my Chevy Avalanche. Cheaply built and all of my flat 4 prong trailer plugs frequently work themselves loose and disconnect. Amazon offers others for a few dollars more. Pay the difference and get one of the better adapters...unless you enjoy being unplugged."
5,Lots of fun for great value,"We bought the Air Blaster for my 4 year old son last Christmas. It's too hard for a four year old to pump the rocket by himself, of course (it takes a lot of muscle to pump it really high), but it has been great fun for he and his Dad to do together. We were amazed by how high the rocket goes -- it is really hard to see sometimes because it is so high! We have used it so much we bought extra rockets and boosters to continue the fun. And the best part was the price -- great bang for the buck!"
3,not easy to use,"I'm not exactly a beginner with this type of thing, but I have not been able to create a label that suits me.\I'll keep at it though."
5,"IF YOU EVEN THINK YOUR PROBLEM IS ANGER, THIS BOOK'S FOR YOU","If you have ever considered your problem may be anger, this is the right book for you. I am 30 years old and was the type that would be firm when upset, but not (I thought) too angry. I also had occasional violent blow ups.(3-5 time per year, for about 15 years) I was on course to destroying my relationship by casting blame and not assuming any. This book does two things well. First it enables you to determine what type of anger you have and secondly how to deal with it. This book is very well written and by the end of the first chapter I felt confident that I could defeat my anger. It has been several months now and I am able to express my anger constructively and have regained my life. Having dealt with this problem has lifted a load I never even knew existed. Even my co-workers say I seem much happier and they now enjoy working with me. This book will help you or your loved ones live a happier, healthier life at any age. You can do it!"
1,Extremely limited in its scope and validity,"This book is so bad I had to look through the whole thing to fathom just how narcissistic and narrow the author's approach to anger actually was. Obviously, the topic is important; humans get angry, and if techniques for managing and modulating anger were better held within my own grasp, my life would be be smoother and happier. What's shocking about this shallow treatment is that it begins with a trite epigraph (The best time to manage anger is before it happens) attributed to WDG. I've never read a book where the author quoted himself before starting the book. It gets worse, since over half the anecdotes of recovery from anger are drawn from the author's own life. In the final chapter, one of the few sources for anecdotes, John, is revealed to be a beard, since ""If you've read this book from cover to cover, you realize John's story is my story."""
1,Not very useful,I am angry I wasted money on this book. The book description IS the book. I found very little here to apply to my life. Anger is not good for you. Duh! Why would I even bother to buy a book. The anecdotes were more annoying than anything. Save your money.
4,Awesome!,Purchased this for my niece for Christmas. She collects all kinds of Pin-Up Girl stuff. She loved this calendar! She was thrilled because she had been looking for a calendar over the years like this and could never find one.
1,The reviews are written by the author?!!,I am merely in the process of conducting a search;but the fact that the author has written the reviews himself (and refers to himself in the third person for one review)causes this marketer to not be interested in what he has to say. How ridiculous! Note: The review requires selecting a rating. I have not actually read the content which may be quite good.
4,RaggTopp Care kit,"I use these products in my BMW-Z3 top.I followed the instructions and the top like really new, nice impermiabilization.Last day it rained a lot and the rain drops bounce the top without wet the surface."
2,RaggTopp Review,"In short, RaggTopp convertible top care doesn't measure up to my expectations. I read about the history of the product and product reviews before my purchase, which influenced my purchase. Sorry to say this stuff just didn't provide noticeable results in cleaning the fabric top of my Porsche Boxster. I can only guess that the ""protectant"" product is working. The application of the protectant can be arduous because it is in an aerosal can. Any breeze or air movement will cause the product to fall on the glass and paint surfaces of your car. All in all, I probably won't purchase this particular product again."
2,It does work but...,"the cleaner works fine, leaving the top really clean.protectant do not leave a shine coat like other protectants does. I followed instructions in strict order and leaved a nice coat of protectant without necessarily leaving a mess. I wait a while to check it's ""magic"" effect but two weeks later still waiting for some david cooperfield stuff. another thing, the protectant is a spray, so is very inefficient in saving it's content for a next use; almost used a can for a single application. if you buy it, please consider eye protecting googles. for it's price it's expensive and inefficient."
5,Good stuff,It works surprisingly well on my 350z top. It went from gray back to black and it looks like a band new top.
2,disappointing,I bought this product to re-water proof my convertible soft-top. The result after I used it was disappointing (utilized as described). I finally bought and product water proofer for fabric boat roofs which was amazing. My soft-top is perfectly water-resistant again!
1,Did not do what product stated,"Was really looking forward to the results I read about... Did not get full three coats with spray sealer. Was okay about this, but when rained on, it did not bead up AT ALL. Rain soaked top flat with no visible improvement from prior to application. Very let down :-("
2,"Okay, I get it-I just paid $35 for a few ounces of stuff","Okay, call me the dummy. The spray treatment for the top lasted for ONE coating or application-not several as I had been led to believe. And the cleaner?....mix some simple green in warm water and use a small scrub brush.Despite all the rave reviews, I have this sick feeling I've just been hustled!"
4,Patience,Wonderful book. Being able to relate to Laura on many levels-this book brings hope to so many people trapped by their own fears.
4,Loved it,"A good book for inspiring stories of women chefs, and a lot of histroy behind women in the culinary profession."
5,A nice compilation of prayers of adoration,"Whether you spend time in Eucharistic adoration or not, you'll find something to like in this collection of prayers designed to be said before the Blessed Sacrament.Paul Thigpen has compiled such gems as:""Adoration will heal our Church and thus our nation and thus our world.... When we adore, we plug into infinite dynamism and power. Adoration is more powerful for construction than nuclear bombs are for destruction."" - Peter Kreeftor""I know I would not be able to work one week if it were not for that continual force coming from Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament."" - Mother Teresa of CalcuttaThere is much in this little book to enjoy - over and over again. It includes Scripture as well as poetry and litanies, as well as thoughts from a diverse group of people including Saints, Popes, and lay people.I know I will use it during adoration often."
3,Good product but difficulties for getting it in Belgium [Taxipost],"Excellent quality and fast shipment from US to Europe but it became nearly impossible to get once it arrived at Brussels.Taxipost came to deliver it twice without notice in working hours [of course, no one home], I then called to set an appointment on a saturday morning [large margin: 9-12h] they arrived during the afternoon [of course, no one home] and refused to come again to deliver it because this would be a third time. Taxipost office is out of Brussels with no easy communications... a simple notice would have been enough for delivering just once..."
3,"Not Jazz, But Not truely blues","I seen this band play, once they opened for a true Blues Legend Albert king.. I mean they were not bad, their musically talented, but at the end of the day, Can you truelly call them a blues band you'll recomend? not really. As Albert king well put it.. "" Blues full or Room""...Its hard to judge fairly when they opened for a master blues guitarist Albert King!......in all, not bad, but a great blues band? eh!"
4,Beyond Betrayal,This book was ordered as a resource for the Lay Counselors in a Counseling Center. One counselor ordered and read his copy and he says it is fantastic. It is written so the average person can understand it. He was very enlightened by the content and will be understanding much better the issues of life after boyhood sexual abuse. He will be loaning it to a couple of his clients.
5,Life changing assistance,"Gartner has written a must-read book for those of us in recovery. I've read several books on the subject, and ""Beyond Betrayal"" almost seems to be written directly about MY life. I learned so much about myself by reading and journaling along with this wonderfully helpful book. It has been extremely helpful to my wife as well...she understands so much about me now. Thanks Dr. Gartner!"
2,Round holes and square pegs,"I enjoyed re-reading the fables by HC Anderson again but by trying to link it to the business world, it seemed like the author is trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole. So, to enjoy the book, read the fable, read the wisdom for the workplace portion as a stand alone. Some of the ideas suggested by the author are gems although no new ground was broken."
3,Not so notorious movie,"America has a fascination with the lives of beautiful women who live lurid lives. And this fascination is catered to by cable shows, movies, documentaries and other media that explore the hidden lives of prostitutes, strippers, porn stars, etc... Most of these are low quality, though some, like this full-length feature film, is a serious attempt to tell us the live of one of the first poster babes. Following her life and career, the movie covers both the glamour and the seedy side of the business, which we see very quickly when the main character is gang-raped on a group date. Though the subject matter is sex and sex appeal, there is little skin in the movie, probably a lot less than seen in many of the recent raunchy comedies. All in all, a low-key movie that does not try to glamorize or over-expose the life and career of Bettie Page."
2,Candy coated.....rushed at the end,"Pass on this one folks...unless you really have time to burn.At the very least, you will want to know more about this iconic figure.Personally, I found the film to be very shallow. You never get an opportunity to know Betty, or any of he people that photographed her. No smoking...no drinking...no drug use.....Good period costuming though and some decent visual film work..."
2,Ugh. Don't even rent this one.,"To be fair, I didn't view this entire movie. I couldn't finish it. Although the camera work is lovely, the costumes are beautiful and accurate, and Ms. Mol made a fabulous Bettie, this movie does not do the famous pin-up queen any justice. Flashbacks of her early life are pitiful-poor young Bettie the victim is mistreated by one man after another, pouting and crying. She was a strong woman in reality, but this film presents her as an abused creature to be pitied. Although it is never stated, the movie implies that the reason she got in to fetish modeling was a direct result of her abusive and tumultous childhood. Blech. This film is rather entertaining to look at but if you really want to get a sense of who Bettie Page was, look somewhere else."
5,My top 5,The Notorious Bettie Page is now among my top 5 favorite films. The movie was in depth about her life as well as her career. I believe Gretchen Mol did a fantastic job in her role of Bettie. The movie also offers amazing special features!
4,The Beautiful Gretchen Mol,"This reviewer thought that Gretchen Mol 's performance in THE NOTORIOUS BETTY PAGE in the title role was spirited and breathtaking. The story and script was not over the top and non-exploitive, and it did capture a slice and time of American history/culture (the post WWII America 1950's) when life seemed tame, safe, and somewhat boring? It was nice to see when contemporary America at the time had these slight aberrations of slight deviant behavior simmering underneath the country, questioning decency and morals in society, right before the 60's counter-culture was about to emerge. Overall, a great cast, decent script and cinematography (capturing the look and feel of the 1950's), and the beautiful Gretchen Mol capturing the look and spirit of the queen of the golden age of pin-up girls."
4,the notorious bettie page,"this movie was about what I expected. The story itself was very blan, but then again, the true story of bettie page isn't really that exciting. The shoots were good, and very well defined. the costums and era wear were very well put. I enjoyed much of this film, and felt bad the way this girl was kicked around in her life. but then again, times for poor families are always tough. She was a victim, but was very resilient. The girl that starred was a very good choice, and the nude scenes were really cool."
1,F*CK THIS DVD,This freaking dvd has about ten minutes of previews that are unskippable and cannot be fast forwarded! DVD skip and needs restarting? Sit through the previews again...want to finish the movie a different day? Sit through the previews again...This is unacceptable these days...it is made worse by the fact that this is a rather mediocre movie about an amazing subject.
2,It is a good day for creeping porn?,"I suppose this is supposed to be ok because she became a lay minister at the end?For me this movie is the beginning of a social rot that eventually will have to be dealt with.There is probably a reason why we wear things and certain behavior is controlled by law in almost all organized societies?What some people think is a more open culture is actually probably just a sign of social decay. We had 40000 years in the stone age and as a resultthere were social codes that were pretty universal with a few exceptions.Until mankind gets better at controlling his urges, he has to try to stall inside certain bounds orall social conduct is in danger?Pornography is one thing we are in serious trouble over as a society."
3,My Bettie,"I'm an avid Bettie fan! I was so excited to receive this movie and watch it. And then I was let down...However, I love Gretchen Mol as Bettie - she's got it down, although I did feel like at times her performance was a tad forced.The writing of this film is only mediocre. I was somewhat upset to find that it's not really a biography and it doesn't really give a full, clear picture of who this amazing woman was. The movie only lightly touches on her tragic past and all-together ignores other aspects of her life which surely shaped who she was and who she would become. It really bothers me that the writers left a lot of information about her life out of the film.Worth a view, but take it with a grain of salt."
3,"Excellent movie, obnoxious DVD","This is one of those DVDs that will not let you fast-forward through the introductory trailers or studio credits. During the first several minutes that the DVD players, it will not respond to pressing the Menu button.I suppose this is the studio's way of punishing the viewer for buying or renting the DVD.I deducted two stars for this obnoxious marketing practice.The movie itself is excellent."
2,The illustrated Mary,"Very illustrated featuring mainly Mary's imprisionment. This book focuses on many specific parts of her life, hands...eyes...handywork ect. It shows many portraits I have never seen before. Including one of Mary and Darney together. I had forgotten that Mary wore wigs later in life, ""When the executioner held up the royal head on the scaffold he found himself holding the Queen's wig while her head fell onto the boards beneath."" If this dosen't conjure up an image I don't know what will."
2,Objective but depressing,"I enjoy reading about entrepreneur and learning about how they built their particular business into a success. If you are looking for the same thing in this book you will be very disappointed. The book goes through a blow-by-blow account of P Diddy's problems and ultimately questions his ethics. I believe the book is written objectively, but very few pages are are actually dedicated to expalining how he actually made the leap from intern to a CEO of a multi-million dollar company. That was the story I really wanted to read about. Unfortunately, I learned more about Puffy's legal trial than I did about how he built his empire. If you want an entrepreneurial focused book buy Russell Simmons' Life and Def instead."
3,Not really what I expected...,I thought this book would be more focused on actual business strategies used to grow the business not the stories on how Puffy he recorded CDs.
2,"Good information, but lacking on important details","I recently returned from a trip to Paris where I had the opportunity to shop. This book had good information, but is seriously lacking details. Many of the addresses for the stores are wrong. Many times I would search for a store, only to find the address, but the store was not located there.For one store (Monoprix), she did not give an address but described it as between a cluster of stores and the Hotel de Ville. It was actually a 20 min walk past the Hotel de Ville! We wasted over 40 minutes because she didn't provide accurate information.She also writes that you are limited to bringing $400 worth of goods out of the country, when the limit is actually $800.This would be a good book if the editors checked her information to be sure it was factual."
2,INFORMATION IS GENERALLY A REPEAT OF PREVIOUS EDITION,"MS. GERSHMAN'S BOOK IS AMUSING AT BEST, BUT MOST TOPICS ARE COPIED WORD FOR WORD FROM THE LAST EDITION. ALSO HER ADVICE IS SOLELY BASED ON HER OPINIONS AND NOT GEARED TO EVERYONE. FOR EXAMPLE, SHE ONLY LISTS HOTELS WHICH ARE-AT LEAST FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON-SO EXPENSIVE. STAYING AT THE HOTEL DE CRILLON OR THE WESTIN DEMEURE HOTELS FOR AT LEAST $200/NIGHT IS NOT WHAT THE AVERAGE PERSON CAN AFFORD. TRUE THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT SHOPPING, BUT AS LONG AS SHE'S INCLUDING A SECTION ABOUT HOTELS SHE SHOULD AT LEAST GIVE A BROAD RANGE OF ACCOMODATIONS AT WHICH TO STAY."
1,Great Read - Mediocre Advice,"I purchased this book a little while before going to Paris and read it cover to cover, made maps, reference marks on my maps (basically went over board) believing I had invested money in a guide that was somewhat acurate. Sadly, I was mistaken - many of the stores mentioned were either no longer in business or were at another address. Most of the advice was off the cuff and not honest enough to be taken seriously by anyone. It is a fun read, don't get me wrong, but more as fiction than fact. Paris is a living, breathing animal of a city, always changing - i realize now that advice, not military precision shopping, is what I am looking for, and this is not it."
2,Born To Spend Lots Of Money,"Ms Gershman's book is amusing. Sometimes a bit of information, but not quite accurate. She praises the flea markets but I've found that they contain a lot of garbage or possibly stolen goods. Her research was so-so, at best. Not quite the best for bargain shoppers and she seems to continually sing the praises of Hermes. She has to realize that there is a difference between shopping and bargain shopping. You can spend a lot of money needlessly doing it her way. Also, she overhypes a lot of problems (no problems with ATMs or Metro). Ms Gershman also needs to realize that book writing of this kind is an evolving process. You don't just write a book of this kind once and expect to revise it a little every few years. A book of this kind needs to be totally rewritten, especially with internet shopping available and stores constantly opening and closing. This edition may have been correct a few years ago, but things have changed. I gave her an extra star for the amusement."
4,just ok,I am a fan of suzy gershaman and have bought this book before. I bought this as an update and found it almost the same...not much new so if you have bought this book before it is not necessary to buy it again. the book itself is well written and is of good use in Paris.
4,Useful but not the bible,"Working in middle management at a French company, I travel frequently to Paris. On each trip, I spend a day sightseeing or shopping. Recently, I purchased this book and have found a lot of helpful tips. For instance, snobby friends back home are more impressed by a $5 box from La Maison du Chocolat than a larger box of (potentially better) boutique chocolate. Or the fantastic convenience of a Carte Orange. Or where to ask for the discount card at Galleries Lafayette. And I agree with her commonsense recommendations, like avoiding buying American fashion or Japanese electronics while in Paris.The book is not perfect, however. Many of her favorite Parisian stores are not so interesting now that they are appearing in the Western Hemisphere, like Sephora and Occitane. And I don't rely on her restaraunt recommendations. But the little tidbits have more than paid for the cost of the book."
5,2009 Super Way to Begin the New Year,I always eagerly await Suzy's latest Born To Shop Editions from all over the world and this one didn't disappoint. Since she has lived there for over 5 years this edition has been stream lined to perfect. Even with the transportation strike while visiting this past 2 weeks.............Thanks!!Update: I love travel guides filled with glossy color photos & buy lots of them but I also purchase ALL of Suzy's books since she is so fascinating and fill in the blanks-this brand new Paris edition arrived today & I am a happy lady planning my next adventure!!!!
2,I didn't like it.,"It could be just a matter of taste, but this wasn't what I was looking for. After hoping for something along the lines of the ""Hunt For Red October"" soundtrack, this is a different sound altogether."
1,Musica Popular de los Andes is a Bootleg!,"This CD is another of the series of bootlegs that came in from Italy in the mid '90s, featuring Yma Sumac. Selling (or buying) it is illegal and it has no business being available on amazon.com. All of Yma Sumac's early material is owned by Capitol Records / EMI and without exception, every legitimate pressing bears their trademark while this one does not. Buy it at your own risk!"
3,Umm...It was cool,"I thought it to be a little bit wild. It was good easy reading, but really not of the pulp fiction type drama."
3,Very Different,"Although the book is very different, it is a must read for any woman who has been mistreated by a man and has dreamed about some type of vindication. Although Sasha' s Way is not the way of many, it sure made me feel good to live vicariously through her. I felt better just by reading it."
5,page turner!,This was a good book. I couldn't put the book down. I had to pass it on to my sister who agreed with me 100%.
5,She'll Sneak Up On Ya!,"Sasha was not to be played with! A woman scorned from the hurt of her deceased husband(which she made possible), brought out a killer in her that couldn't be tamed. Thank God for her brother! This book was wild, and off the chain, and got you from the very beginning. The way a book is supposed to be!"
2,"The plot is great, but...","I think every women dreams of revenge ""Sasha's Way"", but I found the details lacking. Murder ""Sasha's Way"" should entail greater detail than what the heroine wore. I was surprised at how thin and trite the dialogue seemed. I was a little disappointed - but I think it is a good first effort."
3,She was something...,I completed this book only because I had spent my money. I was not moved by this story. The entertainment value was not there for me. The way that this woman carried on bothered me for some reason. I did not start to enjoy this book until I was into the last 40 or so pages. It was different.
5,SASHA'S WAY,This book was a very good book. I couldn't hardly put the book down.Sasha was a killer to her heart even though some of the men did need killing.It would have been good to have a Sasha's two to see if she really did stop killing .
2,SOMETHING DIFFERENT!,"I must say this book was very...well...different from what I'm used to reading. And even though this review is late (as in date) I was just able to find it. Since Amamzon was sold out! The cover and the beginning chapter captured my attention, but the story line lacked something...what that is I don't know!"
5,An Intriguing story!,"Sasha's Way captures the reader's attention from the opening paragraph. I enjoyed this very intriguing tale of a Black female serial killer. When have we ever seen this before? The story is intense and extremely imaginative. However, the violence is not for the weak of heart. The two main characters are richly portrayed and the author does a fine job of allowing the reader to get to know them. The scenes are vividly written, and one can't help but seeing and feeling everything described within. Scott Haskins is a great story teller! I can't wait for additional books from him."
1,DONT GET THIS ITEM.. FROM THIS PLACE,NEVER GOT MY DAMN BOOK .. NEVER GOT MY DAMN BOOK DONT ORDER ANY THING FROM THIS AMAZON THEY ALLOW ANYONE TO SELL THINGS ON HERE TO THE POINT THAT UR NOT RECIEVING UR STUFF...
4,Sasha did it her way,What a diferent read. A educated sister doing a job vigilante style.A brother like Rock watching your back. Scott you really have an imagination. I liked the book. Good luck. Waiting for your next novel.
1,Better than live,"WEll, the cd is better than their live show. I saw her band in Victoria, B.C. Canada on holiday in 1999 and Michelle Morand's singing was really off key (like scratching down the chalk board off-key). I'm glad the MP3s are better but still I agree with another review that it needs to be polished. I really like the lyrics she wrote, maybe she could write music for other singers! She's got good stories in her songs. I don't think they're together anymore after the cd cause I went to her website and it's old stuff from 1999."
1,"gawd awful, am i being mean?","i think this gurrl should consider vocal lessons in a big way and that the boyz in the band move on with their talent! i'm sorry but from what i've heard, this albumn is not worth the dollars.....just my opinion. i agree with the other guy and i can see why he's selling his copy."
2,Needing polish,"While the content within the songs of the album are intelligent, most of the vocal tracks were surprisingly unpolished. It is with wonder that the producer of the album did not take the time to either suggest more work on the vocals, as oftentimes the vocalist is unable to reach a solid note, or to completely redo various tracks to ""cover up"" the lack of strength and range. A typical album, typical genre of low grade music styling, and just overall typical. Not one of my favourites but everyone wants to be a star, eh?"
1,Not worth (the money),Try to get a copy for cheaper if you HAVE to buy it.I didnt like it at all becuase her voice was winey..but I really like Jan Arden so get that instead.
1,Needs lots of work,I am not going to buy this cd because I listened to some tracks here and on another site and I didn't like her voice at all. I agree below with Karen who said that everyone needs to start somewhere because this singer really has began recording prematurely and has obviously started 'somewhere'. I hope she figures it out and realizes what to do right because maybe some day she can do another cd and more people will like it. It's a shame though. I also think that the recording studio she must have went to is small time because it's not very good.
5,Fighter Boys,"A well researched book. Gives history of the RAF from WWI when it was called the RFC. Mentions several pilots, their lives before, during and after the war. Author gives you the feeling that you are there with these extraordinary young men. There might not be a detail accounts of the dogfighting during the air battles but the author still is able to describe very well from the interviews and research he did.Recommend this book for the serious reader in regards to the Battle of Britain. It was written sixty three years after the Battle of Britain and by then many documents have been declassified providing a better understanding of the battle. Also many families were gracious to provide personal diaries of the fighter pilots."
2,Disappointing,"I read the whole book, but felt that I was rereading the same chapter over again I didn't think the author has much of a feel for flying or the action involved. In a word, disappointing."
1,"If you like plastic smelling water, this kettle is for you!","I bought this kettle in the hopes that it would boil the perfect cup of water for tea....IT DIDN'T. After a few minutes of the kettle heating up the water the kitchen smelled of burnt plastic. Once it was finished boiling the smell was even stronger! I tried boiling it a few times, emptying out the pot and trying again...to no avail.This is a poorly designed item, even though it looks great on a kitchen counter."
2,either mine is faulty or this is a bad product,"It does heat water very quickly. However, the automatic shut off safety feature is very random. It does not shut off automatically on its own consistently. If you pick up the kettle before the on/off button has clicked over to off it will stay on, even if there is no water in it. When there is very little water in the pot the button will jerk back and forth trying to shut off but won't. Look at other options before you select this sleek loking model."
2,Disappointing,"I loved this item when I first got it, but after about a year it proved disappointing and I finally had to replace it. It eventually stopped heating the water properly and got to the point where I could never get water to a boil. I also ended up having problems with the automatic shut off switch. It's a beautiful product and looked great, but in the end, I had to replace it! Disappointing."
2,Not Recommended,We brought this kettle because of the glass looking. It worked fine during the first 6-month but after that it stopped working properly. Sometimes the power could not be turned on and sometimes it started to heat up by itself when it was empty. We are in the market for another water kettle but we are not taking our chance of buying this one.
1,Yuck - Tastes like Plastic,"The heating element of this kettle is covered with plastic. When the water is heated it tastes like plastic. It is one of only a few items I have ever bought that I returned. It does look cool when it boils, but it is not worth it. Save your time and money and buy a stainless steel water kettle."
2,Stopped working,"I received this kettle as a gift, at Christmastime. I'm the only person who uses it, so it doesn't get much use. I probably used it once a week. By May, the automatic switch (off) was no longer working. This may seem like a small thing - one would think you could just stand near the kettle and watch it - but, for whatever reason, the pot will no longer boil water fully. It comes nearly to the boiling point, then it stops, then...minutes later, it will start again, then it stops, (repeat cycle over and over).If I walked away, or if I had children, this would be very dangerous. I can no longer get boiling water from the kettle, just ""very hot water"". It's a shame, because I liked the kettle. I did not experience the chemical smell/taste products that others experienced and I am very concerned with such things, so I was on the lookout.The kettle looks great and I love that it's clear, but now it's useless."
5,Like my Capresso,"This is actually my 2nd Capresso - the lid fell off after about 4 years. We have super hard water and water boiled in the microwave makes scummy tea. Boiling in the Capresso glass container somehow gets rid of the scum and is faster than our microwave. We use it 4-5 times a day. Plus, it looks nice on my counter."
1,Pretty + toxic smell = Nasty taste and smell,"This Stinks!I should have known better than to buy one of these, I thought the reviews of this Capresso Glass Water Kettle smelling must be exaggerations?!?This kettle has a lot of bad reviews for a reason, it stinks!Even after trying suggestions (like boiling white vinegar) to get rid of the stink, it still stinks. And of course, the smell does affect the taste of the hot water it creates.Bottom line is -- do not waste your time with this kettle --I have been reluctant to get rid of mine, since the odor has improved from when it was new. But that was over a year ago, and it still smells bad. Who wants to taste this water? I don't, and have not used it in months.Want mine? I'll sell it to you for 1$ plus shipping."
5,total convenience!,"After reading reviews that complained of odor, I went in to test my capresso unit. No smell, and I am extremely sensitive to those sort of things. My experience has been that evenings are now always filled with a variety of herbal tea experiences, because it is so easy to make a cup at a time in just two minutes with everyone getting their own flavor. I always use water filtered through a reverse osmosis unit, (perhaps that helps?) which means that I have absolutely no mineral buildup. It is elegant, always ready, and has made evenings quite enjoyable. Have owned it for a little over a year, used daily. Highly recommended!"
5,Glass waer kettle,excellent product and easy to use. Like the ability to boil water for tea or coffee extremely quickly. Recommend it for anyone who is in a hurry.
1,Rust & Strange Smell,"Less than 30 days after use, the heating element has rust appearing. There is a distinct unpleasant smell that will not go away with washing. The water ends up having a strange taste. Just yesterday, I was at my local thrift store and saw this kettle for sale for $8. It also had that strange smell inside. I felt like a sucker for paying $59.99. The smell makes me fear I am cooking the adhesive or sealant into my water. My kettle might end up at that thrift shop unless I can arrange a return."
4,Convenient!,"This is a glass container, unlike the plastic models that make the water smell like plastic, so it seems safer to boil water in. However there is a rubbery smell at first due to the gasket in the bottom. It is fast and convenient to have in my office when I want something hot to drink.Nice design."
5,Fast and convenient,"I was a little concerned after reading some of the negative reviews on this kettle, but decided to take a chance anyway. I had converted to an induction cook top and my old kettle no longer works. I love this kettle. It boils water amazingly fast and is simple to clean. If you are looking for an electric kettle, I highly recommend this one. It is very cool."
1,Short Lived,This Capresso H20 Plus Glass Water Kettle died after just 4 months use. The water when boiled often smelled metallic. I agree with the other reviewers and I won't bother to try to contact the Capresso company as they have reported difficult communication. $60 is too much to spend for a poor product. Amazon should quit carrying it for sale.
2,"Loved it at first, but it just stopped working","I enjoyed using this kettle very much for about six months. It boiled water quickly, looked great on the counter-top, and unlike the description in other reviews, did not cause the water to smell or taste bad. Then one day, the blue ""on"" light turned off for no apparent reason, then turned on 30 to 60 seconds later, and then went off again. In the following days,I kept trying to use it, hoping that it would somehow fix itself, but it did not, and I had to toss it. Very disappointing."
1,"Very, very disappointed...","Sigh. I love love love how this kettle looks, and chose to ignore the negative reviews about the plastic inner coil with the horrible smell and water taste. I've tried baking soda, white vinegar, lemon juice, everything. There is something inherently toxic about the blasted inside, and I finally had to capitulate to my husband this morning when he said ""I'm really worried that something you drink every day smells so poisonous."" It's packed up and going back. We've ordered a $29 all stainless steel, highly reviewed replacement. Not as sexy looking, but a lot safer choice. Would it be so hard to make a glass kettle that does not have fricking plastic inside???????"
4,Lid on Capresso unit appears to be blistering,"We are not experiencing the problems noted by some other users of this product. At this time, our only problem is : it appears the silver lid is blistering. It appears the lid can be replaced easily. We are hoping this problem can be easily resolved. We love the convenience and speed with which it heats the water. We have asked the seller to simply send us a new lid."
1,DOA and smelled,"This is a great looking kettle and I bought it because is was the top rated one by Americas Test Kitchen, but ours arrived and would shut off before water came to a boil, plus I couldn't get the smell out of the kettle. Exchanged for T-Fal kettle that is great, but not great looking"
3,Worked well and died after 18 months.,"Heated water quickly. Noticed the foul smell, but didn't seem to transfer to water.Used at least twice daily for 18 months and it quit this morning.Not a good track record."
2,Well ...,"Bought it in Target for about $50. Replaced with KRUPS BW3990 and love it.Pros:- good looking- comes with fancy flower tea (better looking than tasting)Cons:- plastic smell for 2 weeks, then you get used to it- lid broke in less than a year- kind of small, especially when you have guests- after it auto-turns-off, takes about 30 seconds before you can turn it on again"
1,The tortoise of teakettles,"So let me see if I've got this right. You put water in this pretty little glass pot, the one that cost $60 and change, you push up the mood lighting on-off switch and the water boils. Quickly. That's what happened yesterday, the first day. Today it's a different story. This is the Beelzebub of kettles -- there are no Beelzebubbles. It's now 3:31 p.m. I came home at 2:30 p.m. and turned on the kettle for a cup of tea. After 20 minutes, I plugged in the old $15 Proctor Silex and had hot water in two minutes, a cup of tea in five. I am still waiting for the Capresso to boil. It heats a little, then sulks, heats a little more, then goes, I guess, on vacation. It's not like I'm asking it to do dishes, wash windows, learn Esperanto or clean out the gutters. I do my job, why can't it?"
2,No odor problem but others,"I got this for my mother and it has no odor problem ... but it has several others. The light that indicates if it is heating or not is so dim that I have to cup my hand around it tell. After the light goes out and the water is supposed to be hot, it is barely hot enough to make light tea. If I let it sit and go back on again, it soon does become hot but by then I could have done it on the stove. Just looking at it, you really can't tell if the switch is in the on position or not. It is only about a quarter of an inch movement and with no lines or markers, you just can't tell. All in all, it is pretty, but not well thought out and doesn't work so well either. It is going back."
1,Glass Cracked Within the First Two Months,"This morning suddenly, after normal usage, just after the unti hit boil and I was pouring the hot water into my French Press the glass cracked and the boiling water went all over the place. I won't be buying one of these again. Ugh! Any suggestions on the best one?"
2,Rust spots after 6 months,"The kettle is nice, lightweight and heats water fast. But it's hard to keep clean. After less than a year, there are numerous rust spots on the heating element. I've tried using vingear and the glass gets very clean and nice, but the element is still rusting. For a tea kettle this price, I would expect better. A good tea kettle should be able to last years. I will be replacing this one and not buying Capresso products again."
3,Capresso glass water kettle,"It has modern look ,easy to clean,but still after using the cattle for a couple of months can not get rid of smell of rubber."
2,DON'T BUY,"I bought this kettle not from Amazon, but I feel I need to add my two cents. This kettle kept knocking off the power in my house. The fouls odour /smell was not realy a big concern as I thought with time it will disappear, but anytime I put it on, all power is gone. I plugged other kettles into the same outlet - no problem. I 've since returned it."
3,Bad Engineering.,"At the time I really liked the style of this Kettle,but within a week I saw a leak through the seal which looks to be silicone,why on earth they would use a compound like this in a heated enviroment is beyond me.I took the kettle back and got a replacement now after putting up with the smell from the silicone the centre heating element is rusting,which is supposed to be Stainless! and the lid hinge broke, absolutely pathetic. critical areas are poorly designed overall the concept is great, but falls down by being cheaply made. gotta make those bucks."
3,Kept its shape for only 1 year.,"I was very happy with the look, with how the kettle worked until one year has passed after I purchased it. I noticed after the first couple month that the kettle would start up by itself if the water level is too low. So I took a habit of unplugging it. But after one year of use, the main blue bottom came off and the top of the kettle started chipping off showing the cheap plastic underneath. So now I am looking for a different one. Would love to get a Brown brand, but just seems to be impossible to get it in USA. This is the only brand that never failed me or my friends."
1,DO NOT BUY,Do NOT buy this product. All the reviews regarding bad smell are correct. It smells like chemical ridden fish! it was fine for a couple of weeks for me but now it's unbearable. I'm going to try to return it and find another kettle.
5,GREAT GIFT,"I HAVE OWNED A CAPRESSO GLASS WATER KETTLE FOR MANY YEARS AND DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT IT. IT WORKS PERFECTLY; HOWEVER, SINCE I HAVE HAD IT SO LONG, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE ONE JUST IN CASE! I CAN'T THINK OF A DAY WITHOUT ONE! I BOUGHT A SECOND ONE FOR A FRIEND OF MINE, BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WILL LOVE IT ALSO."
1,Worked great until it died,"I received this as a gift 3 months ago. It abruptly quit boiling water last week. The looks are great, but perhaps the electrical components need work! What a waste of money."
1,"Worked great for the 1st year, eventually returned it due to particles in water","I have owned the Capresso for over 2 years and decided to return it and buy a Le Creuset tea kettle instead.Pros:- Nice aesthetic design- Heats water fast and automatic shut offCons:- After a number of uses, I found small particles/residue that floats in the water after boiling the water. I am not sure if it is my local water source or if it is particles coming off the O-ring that surrounds the metal heating dome. Seems like its from the water kettle though!- I also found that over time, residue builds up on the heating dome after only a few uses (eventually after every use), necessitating a lot of scrubbing to clean it each time."
3,Capresso Tea Pot,"I like the German glass bowl. At least I hope it's GermanI dislike the fact that it is made or assembled in China. Try as I did, I could not find a domestic tea pot.There is a slight odor from the pot as others have described. Doesn't seem to bother the flavor as far as I can tell.Amazon shipped it pretty fast compared to other instances, but came well packed.Overall pretty nice, quick boil times and the automatic stop on boil feature is fantastic. Also the fact that the pot comes off the base with no cords attached is a super feature."
5,Super efficient water-heating pot,"Heats water in a few seconds. Boils in about a minute. This has to be the most efficient, least-energy-used way to heat water with electricity. Safe because only glass and stainless steel touch the water. Directions say, put only water in it. But of course you can use it for tea, coffee, dish water!"
2,lasted only 9 months,"I bought this kettle in November 2007 from Amazon. It stopped working - will not switch on - August 10, 2008. It has always been treated with appropriate care.It worked fine for the 9 months that it did.It is still under warranty so I am going to call the company and see what their response is. I will update this review once I hear from them."
2,The Cap broke off by the heat,"I bought two of this beautiful looking Capresso water kettle. The first one lasted almost an year and the cap's chrome or ""shining thing"" started to peel off and with green thing on it. The 2nd one I used for over a year and the plastic/metal connection between the cap and the kettle went brittle, must be from the heat, and broke. And the ""chrome"" top came off the plastic cap. Now I am boiling water without the chrome top and only the plastic cap. I suspect the plastic may contain BPA?I love the design and glass body. But why does the manufacturer use a better material for the cap and the connecting parts.I don't mind to pay more for a better made product. Now I see some competitors also come up with glass body kettle, but are they made by the similar manufacturers?Any one with a better glass kettle, please advise!"
1,keep looking,"this is the second one i got, both blew out within a few months, customer service so bad that i just bought another one rather than dealing with them, but now this is the second one that has broken. works well but only for a few months."
5,I love this kettle,"I read through all the reviews but since I really like the style of this kettle, I decided I would order it and try it myself. I have been nothing but well pleased. It is true that the interior had a very displeasing smell (I think some people referred to it as a ""chemical"" smell), but after about 6 rounds of boiling water it has gone away and let me say that these 6 rounds of boiling water were used to make cups of tea with absolutely no bad taste to the water at all. When the water boils and I pour it into our teacups, I immediately empty the kettle, place it back on its base, and open the lid so the interior can dry out, which is does in a very short time. Then I close the lid. Again, I am pleased with this kettle. It boils the water VERY quickly, and I love to watch it. It also looks really smart on my countertop. If you really want this kettle, I suggest you try it out yourself."
3,"Looks great, but the smell reviews are true","I bought this because I thought it looked great, which it does! Its beautiful. But it has two issues:1- the blue light (although pretty) is too weak, I usually can't tell if its on or not unless its dark out2- the issues with the industrial smell are true, although I did test it, and the smell is external, its not anything in the water or close to it, so its still safe to drink. And its not terrible, but months later, it's still notable"
2,short life,"I had this kettle for 2 years and it worked great, but one morning it stopped. I think the power based burned out. The company Capresso was completely unresponsive. They did not respond to my phone call or email. They wouldn't even say if I could replace the power base. The Capresso website is very poor. I would not buy this item again, or any item from Capresso. I previously had a Russell Hobbs and it lasted over a decade before developing a slow leak around the water gauge."
1,Toxic Smell and Taste - DO NOT BUY!,"I can't believe they would even sell this! It should be investigated for health concerns!The rubber seal inside the jug boils along with the water and emits a horrible smell and taste in the water. I'm not talking about a minor issue - it's seriously disgusting, undrinkable water that makes me nauseous! DO NOT BUY!If they tell you the smell goes away - DON'T BELIEVE THEM!"
2,"It's a beaut, but its also a bomb ...","The ""chrome"" looking handle part is but a foil sticker. After a few months the blue lens in the switch fell out (glued it back in), the handle started splitting apart at the seam and then the chrome foil started peeling back. Eventually the switch stopped working.We like its look so much that we bought another as a gift. We're told that one is falling apart too.It also gave off a pretty foul smell for quite a while. It's a beaut, but its also a bomb -- this is not the ""kettle"" you are looking for, move along ..."
1,"Nice glass, quick heater, but plastic parts are terrible","It looked nice when it was new. Unlike many others, mine did not stink. Then chrome plating on the plastic lid (do not get confused by the picture, it is not metal, it is cheap plastic) started cracking and peeling off. Later the lid hinges broke, and today the plastic plate that keeps handle attached to the glass got broken. That's it. No parts are offerd to repair it on Capresso website. I guess I will look for some other kettle of better quality."
4,First kettle was flawed; but they replaced it.,"I have owned one of these for about a year. They look nice and work well. The smell that people complain about comes from the glue that holds the cheap plastic cover on the cheap plastic lid (the part that looks like chrome.) It goes away eventually, but at about that point the cheap plastic starts to fall apart. My last electric kettle lasted for 10 years. This is just not a good quality piece of equipment. When the top knob fell off today, I decided to write this review. Skip this kettle if quality means anything to you.UPDATE: I contacted the manufacturer, and they sent me a replacement. I can't argue with that, and the new one does not have the problem previously mentioned."
1,Cheap,"When opening this, I realized, that it was very cheap. It was very lightweight. It used the type of plastic that you just know isn't goint to last. Also, it doesn't look nearly as impressive as the photos. It looks cheap too. Kudos to the product photographer for making it look elegant. I did not notice any odors like other reviewers, but it didn't matter.There isn't any temperature guages, selections. You have one temperature which is activated by a sliding a piece of cheap plastic using your thumb.Lastly, I cannot speak to performance, since the unit did not work. I would avoid this even though it looks nice in the picture."
1,BEWARE OF CHEMICAL LEAK INTO YOUR DRINK,HEALTH HAZARD!No tea kettle should have any plasticky anything come in contact with water you are boiling for your drink.This fact negates anything positive about this kettle since it is of NO USE.PLEASE REDESIGN!
2,Newer version gives PLASTIC flavor,"We've bought two of these kettles. We used the first for years, then it got tired (although it still works most the time). We bought the second for backup, and unfortunately, the lid gives the water a VERY PLASTIC flavor. I ripped the lid off, so now we have to shut it off manually. Hopefully the company switches it's lid material to make this a wonderful kettle again. I think it is beautiful in that it's glass."
1,"Nice thought, bad design, made in china","I bought this kettle at Macy's and was able to use it for about 6 months before it stopped working properly. Some kind of thermal cutoff is engaging and it stops heating before the water boils. Also there is a major recall (15000 units sold) that deals with the handle detaching from the carafe. I'm just glad it failed electrically before the handle broke and spilled boiling water on myself or my kids. I did also smell and taste the odor the other reviewers talk about, and agree that having silicone in direct contact with the heating element is a very bad idea, though it's probably not toxic. There's some other, better designs on the market (seeToastess TGK486 Cordless Glass Kettle, Gray) for glass kettles. I bought my replacement today. Oh well, $50 down the drain..."
3,"Some good, some bad","I have mixed emotions about this product. The design is certainly very attractive. The exterior is flawless, although I was disappointed that the polished crome/silver matte parts are actually plastic. It heats water faster than kettles I've used in the past. I experienced none of the ""foul/chemical smell"" reported by other reviewers. On the downside, mine suddenly stopped working after only 1 month of use. This is a big hassle and unacceptable for a product in this price range."
5,"Looks good, boils well",We like this kettle very much. It quickly gets the water to a boil and it looks nice in our kitchen.
2,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times","Great design, looks great on the counter top. My wife takes her tea every morning and occasionally in the evening so the product was used a lot and cared for a lot. However, it would only boil a a third of a pot of water before the thermostat would shut the unit down, well before it reached a boil. If you waited 5 minutes it would come back on and complete the boil - a pain in the arse. Finally after about 2.5 years it gave up the ghost and does not heat at all. I would avoid the temptation to purchase the unit, its sexy looking but in the end didn't perform."
2,Good product but always breaks. Cheaply made...,"I purchased two of these through a local retailer. The first one broke at the handle where the button is and stopped working altogethe. It would start up and then turn off randomly so it could never complete a heating cycle. It lasted for 6 months to a year. The second one I got as a replacement broke at joint where the lid attaches to the top so it just falls off when pouring (unless you want to hold it in place and burn your hand periodically). Yesterday it started leaking between the black base and bottom of the glass. After hearing reviews of their customer service, I haven't bothered to complain about a replacement. I am looking for an alternative. I liked the product otherwise. It's a shame it's so cheaply or badly made."
2,Questionable quality,"I purchased it from Bed Bath and Beyond, at first the smell was hard to get rid of - silicone seal was releasing fumes under the high temperature. For the first 3 weeks we kept just boiling the water and pouring it out and it helped to get rid of smell. After 2 months of use the plastic cap started melting and breaking in small pieces, also the chrome cap came off loose and glue was crumbling into the kettle. I think it's a health hazard and also a fire hazard, I would not buy it again, my husband threw it in a trash ( $70.00 ) when glue particles ended up in his cup......I was thinking of taking it back to BB and B but it was over 30 days....It's a waste of money....it's a shame for Capresso !"
2,Bad taste,"Reviews are correct - looks ice, but leaves bad chemical taste in water ... Hasn't disappeared after 6 weeks of constant use"
5,Very nice design.,"This kettle sure will look different from anything else on you kitchen counter.It boils water quite fast.Even it is smaller than my previous kettle I did not have inconvenience running out hot water. Since it made from glass it is much easier to judge how much of water left, how much you would like to fill in and boil.Conns: You will have clean it more often than other type of kettle. All that calcium does not look nice."
4,Makes morning coffee easy,"I use it every morning to heat the water for my coffee. It is perfect for the job. In addition, it looks nice on the counter top so you don't need to put it away. I am very pleased and have recommended it to my friends.While it does get mineral deposits quickly (white on the element), it cleans even easier. I heat vinegar in it once a week or so. The rest of the pot hasn't even gotten dirty yet.You can turn it on without any water in it. I did that once and had to leave the thing to cool off before I could do anything with it. It has ALWAYS shut off when there is water boiling in the kettle.Mine did start with that nasty smell. But the smell went away with use. After a while, it is fine with no smell at all.Someone else recommended using it to pre-boil water for pasta etc. That works great as it is so very fast.I have been using it on a daily basis for +3 months. It continues to work well."
1,Boiled Water Smelled/Tasted Bad,"Like many people have already written, the water boiled in this kettle has a rubbery smell and taste, even after rinsing and cleaning it multiple times. I'm not particularly picky or sensitive about these kinds of things, but it was intolerable and I returned the kettle, which is a shame because I really like the look and function of this kettle.I have some friends who have this kettle and they are happy with it and didn't notice any odor, and a number of people reviewing on Amazon also haven't had this problem, so I'm not sure if some people just can't taste this particular flavor in the water or if the production of this kettle is hit-and-miss, with some affected by the smell and others not. Either way, I can't recommend this kettle."
4,the best way to drink tea,This is an essential item that any tea drinker should have. This is the fastest way to get hot water. It is also very safe with the automatic shut off. I recieved my first one as a gift...I am now giving it as gifts.
2,My review after sending two units back,"Two times I had it replaced and spoke with customer service before writing a review. The first unit I purchased worked for about a week. The blue light would come on and off unless you got the position of the kettle just right. After a small while it didn't come on at all. I think it was some connection problem with the heating element. I had to pay the shipping myself to send it back. The second unit I got also broke in the next month because it burned itself out. I did receive free shipping on the second one. Thanks customer service for having the second one replaced, hope it works this time!"
1,Shoddy quality - coming apart after 15 months,Well it was too good to be true. A product that looked really cool and would work well for years.So 15 months after buying it I have to write a review to serve as a warning to other buyers. It still works but a 1/4 inch gap has developed between the top of the handle and where the handle attaches to the glass. it has not broken yet but it will some time soon and in the mean time whenever it is used steam shoots out the gap. Shame really because it still looks kind of cool :(
1,Worked Beautifully for 6 months then.....,"I bought this product at Crate and Barrel and must say I loved it...while it worked for the first 6 months. Never immersed it in water, took excellent care of it. No damage whatsoever. Now it will only warm the water. Shuts off automatically if it gets too hot. Will not be buying another one. I'm going to purchase a glass tea kettle to boil water on the range."
2,No significant improvement in awful taste after all these reviews,"Unfortunately, like so many other reviewers, I am turned off and very disappointed that Capresso hasn't resolved the problem of the chemical, plastic, whatever is causing the ill-taste of the water after boiling. We don't know if there is any health danger as a result of whatever is causing the ill-taste. The pot is attractive and heats quickly which are great selling features, but the taste doesn't let up after over a year of use. Had considered getting a new one after putting a ding in the glass but have decided against it. I'm done with this product. If the problem gets resolved, I'd purchase it again in a heartbeat!"
1,Pay for a terrible taste and smell,This electrical kettle is a total waste of money. The water becomes smelly and tastes like a some strange chemical. I hope the kettle does not poison the water.
1,Looks v Taste,"I found that, although it is a stylish kettle which boils quickly and quietly, I could detect, even after a week's regular use, a perfumey plastic smell from the kettle and in the water it had boiled. I returned the product and bought a stainless steel kettle (by Oster) instead, with which Im happy."
3,"fun, works could be built better","We loved ours for about 1.5 years until the little knob on the lid broke off. Then the chrome-finished lid separated from the functional plastic lid. Without these it doesn't look so great anymore, unfortunately. However, it still boils water fast."
2,Does not last more than one year,"A first and a second Capresso broke down in about one year. We have a third one at a second home, which still working. Agree with all the other reviews of chemical smell. Other than that, the performance and looks are nice. Coffee and tea taste were not affected. Waiting for our last one to break sooner or later... We are not replacing these anymore since this appears to be a product with a very short lifespan. We decided to use an old-fashionned stainless steel kettle for the future. Just too much waste in money and leaving too much human footprint called garbage with this Capresso."
2,Why can't they make stuff that lasts?,"This teapot is not worth the money. Ours only lasted a year and a half. It's a lovely design and boiled water quickly, but about 2 weeks ago the knob on the top snapped off, and then this morning it just stopped boiling water altogether. I just don't understand why companies design such disposable products, but still charge obscene amounts of money for them. Plus, it's not actually made of any sort of polished metal. It's just plastic covered with a shiny silver layer."
4,A nice but not a very convenient kettle,"This is an expensive, though nice-looking kettle, worthy of placing directly on the table. When fresh and clean it is nice to look at when the water is boiling. Also, it arrived (from the US to Canada) in a record ~36 hrs!The kettle has however a few drawbacks to consider:1. The bulging heating element requires boiling much more water than one might need for a sigle cup serving. Also, it makes the scale deposits much more visible than they would be on a flat bottom.2. The on/off switch is not very crisp in moving between the two positions and the blue ""on"" light is VERY dim and hardly perceptible.3. The spout is not the best ergonimically designed, making the pouring of water less than a perfect experience.4. The kettle has no scale filter which means that it has to be rinsed out quite often.5. The nested design (kettle within the base, rather than just sitting on top of it) is less convenient than typical bases."
1,STILL has that nasty taste/smell,"Our old kettle's switch broke so we ordered this one - big mistake. It looks nice and boils water quickly, but after several months, and despite a number of cleanings with soap or vinegar and thorough rinses, our teas STILL have that nasty taste to them and the kettle STILL smells. Don't waste your money buying this."
2,Great while it works but doesn't last long,"We just went through our second one in a year. We liked it and figured we just got a lemon the first go around when it broke after six months, so we tried another one. The second one only lasted four months. It is a nice product (when it works), but I am really disappointed in the quality. I don't want to have to buy a new one every four or five months. The Capresso service support stinks..... I am an engineer and when the second one broke, I tore it apart trying to figure out what was broken, but it is basically a disposable unit, and is not fixable (I couldn't find a new heating element on-line) and the way it is glued together, was never meant to be taken apart and put back together. Try something else, you will be happier in the long run."
3,Excellent until it died - 6 months old,"OK I realize these may not be made for a three to four times per day use. But that's what I do. I have loved it until it just died. I had none of the reported odor issues. It is a tad loud, but it heats the water fast & it sure gets hot - - perfect for tea. Exactly what I wanted & correct size. Problem is - after six (6) months it's just died. Now I guess it's still under warranty. Problem is - I have to find the paperwork & I have too much to do to deal with that. I've had Krups & something else before. The American brand died after a year. The Krups lasted for about 18 months. Now this one only 6 months. Bad trend as far as I'm concerned. So - would I recommend this one - No. I can not do that, six months is not long enough lifespan for this item at this price."
4,Great electric kettle!,"Been using this a few weeks now. Works great, no off-tastes in the water. My only grip and the only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating - the automatic shut off isn't sensitive enough. It can get to boiling pretty hard before it shuts off. Also, if you remove the kettle from it's base before it shuts off, it doesn't automatically shut off, so you could set the kettle down with very little water in it and it will start heating again."
3,Short lifespan,"Beautiful kettle. We bought the first one 2 or 3 years ago, and returned it after a few months due to recall (handle fallling off risk). The second one stopped heating after perhaps a year or so, and my husband was able to repair it, but it conked again after a couple of months, so I don't suppose we'll bother with it again. No problems with bad taste or smell, but perhaps that's because it was an older unit."
1,Terrible smell,"Believe the reviews about a bad chemical smell. I could smell it very strongly immediately after opening the box, and every time I try to boil water in it the smell gives me an instant headache, and after trying to drink beverages made with it I get a scratchy throat for a few hours. It's been cycled over 20 times and it still has the same smell just as strong as day 1. Do not buy it unless you are not affected by strong smells. The people saying we are crazy or that it has no smell must have either gotten a good batch or worked in a glue factory to the point where they wouldn't notice. Calling Capresso yields the familiar ""lemon juice, vinegar, baking soda"" spiel. It's fairly obvious they get calls about it constantly if they train their techs to advise those remedies, which do not work at all anyway. I can't warn against it strongly enough."
5,Capresso glass water kettle,"I am very satisfied with the Amazon service and the product myself. Helped my dad research this to purchase for my mom. She is very satisfied with the glass kettle, since we had previously used seen (& used) it at a family members house.Quick boiling, safe to touch after heating and just the right size make this water heater very sweet. Amazon did a great job delivering it to the right address and kept me informed of its progress. For this product, Amazon did a great job!"
4,2 cups and up,"I really like this product. Shiny, fast, tasty hot water in seconds. My only caveat is the necessity of boiling TWO CUPS at a time--not sure what I should do with the extra ounces of boiled water when I just want to have a cup of tea at night. Will it burn out the boiler to use it for less? I dare not try! What happens if I leave the leftovers in the pot overnight? not sure, but I'll risk it."
1,DO NOT BUY -- Persistent Chemical Odor,"All of the plastic parts have a strong chemical odor. This was reduced somewhat after sponging with soapy water, but still remains. The steam also carries the strong smell.The odor comes not only from the external plastic parts, but is also on the inside of the lid and from the rubbery sealer inside the carafe, which comes in contact with the water.I've tried boiling a dozen batches of water, I've tried cleaning with vinegar, and with soap. I don't know whether it will eventually go away, but really, I shouldn't *have* to worry about this. It should have been taken care of by the manufacturer.Given safety issues with other made-in-China products, I have no confidence in this device and I'm surprised and disappointed by Capresso."
3,Great kettle except for the horrible smell.,"There are plenty of reviews for this kettle so I'm just giving my two cents and will state that yes, it heats water really fast, looks really good, pours very well and SMELLS really bad. I've had it for 2 weeks now and I've ordered a different model. This one is going back, unfortunately, because other than the plastic smell I really liked it."
3,"Good design, poor quality","I had 2 of these kettles. First one lasted for over a year, 2nd one about 8-10 months, then they break down. Ordered 3rd but it arrived malfunctioning, so I had to return and decided to try another model.Great design but I expected better build quality."
3,Smell exists --,"I purchased this product this week. It looks very cool. However, I purchased the kettle to avoid using the plastic coffee maker. Now there is a smell at least during the first few uses that the Capresso gives off. I hope this goes away.If United States corporations did not make every damn thing in China- where there really exists little concern for quality and consumer safety-- these sort of things would happen less frequently..."
2,Pretty but horrible quality.,I got this teapot because i thought it looked amazing and it does when it boils but it is so cheaply made. If you drink tea a lot like me (i boil it at least twice a day this product is not for you). We had to return the first one we got after a week because it started coming apart at the seems. The second one is about 2-3 month and has cracks already. When it doesn't have too much water in it and you turn it on it will keep on boiling that water over and over and over again till you manually turn it off. It wont shut down on its own. I'm very disappointed by the product and sad that I cant return it. It is really not worth the money.
4,Electric water kettle,"I love this kettle. It looks so nice on my countertop due to its sleek design, and we all enjoy looking at the bubbles when the water is boiling. It boils the water really, really fast. I just had to order another one for my girlfriend, after she saw it in my house, as she also loved it. True, the lid could have been made of metal, and not plastic pretending to be chrome, but, I guess, that's how most things are being manufactured in the 21 century. Also, as to the smell about which one reviewer wrote, when the water boils and the pot, and that plastic lid are hot, then there is a faint smell of this plastic. It absolutely does not affect the water! And it really doesn't bother anyone. I would recommend this glass kettle to anyone who is looking for a pretty, sleek product and who appreciates quick water boiling with its help. I just wish that lid was made of metal... But it is fine, anyway (as long as it does not break)."
2,"If you're trying to avoid plastic, don't buy","This is truly a beautiful kettle. It's fast-- I can hardly get my tea ready before it's boiling. However, if your goal is to avoid plastic of any kind, please do not buy this. After one year's use, the top metal of the lid near the pouring spout is peeling back to reveal some sort of plasticky substance underneath. We've used it almost daily for a year. I expected better than this, and I'm now looking for a combination stainless and glass kettle."
5,Capresso glass kettle,"I think the kettle is fabulous! It is cool to watch, quick to heat water, and easy to operate. I love it!"
2,falls apart within a year,"I bought this kettle about one year ago. I loved the look and did not have any problems with smell. I use a kettle several times a day, each day. By month 3 the light on the on/off switch quit working. By month 6, the silver lid fell off into my cup. The glue came off the plastic black part which it was attached to. Then by month 9, it completely stopped working. I took it back to the kitchen store I purchased it from and it was quickly replaced with the exact same model. If it falls apart again, I will throw away and replace with another brand."
1,hmmm.....,"Indeed, this electric water kettle was a nice piece of machinery, but the prevalent stink of hot plasticy chemicals didn't fade over time as I had hoped. Through many a filling and many a heating, the dome inside the pot turned a rusty brown and I worried whatever was occurring to the metal was being transferred to my water and consequently to my belly. I tried gently scrubbing with a kitchen sponge, with the scrubby side and the soft side, but nothing came off. I was still alarmed. Is it my water, or is it my kettle?So when, after about a year of use, I made my morning cup of tea and soon after went to re-heat the pot, without a sound a whimper a click or a beep it failed to turn on. Am I surprised that the appliance at hand broke after such a short amount of time? Not really. Am I disappointed that I spent $69.00 dollars on said tea kettle? Quite. I shall be buying a stove top kettle once again! I am reformed."
3,"Nice glass look, cheap plastic imitation of polished chrome","I've used it since the end of January 2010. It looks great on the counter top, boils water fast, automatically shuts off... Sadly, after about 18 months of use the polished chrome looking lid surface started to peel off and warp from all the steam that goes through it. The black plastic handle is also dangerously warping at the top. The little plastic cover from the blue light on the handle got separated and lost somewhere... Even though the kettle still works, I am worried about accident waiting to happen (separating handle while pournig full kettle) and look to replace it. I wish it lasted more than about 18 months before starting to fall apart, but seeing some other reviews I guess I should not complain.I give it 3 stars for the balance of function, look and quality."
3,Meh,"Bought this in Jan. 2011, based on America's Test Kitchen review. Did not experience some of the chemical smell complained about by others. In fact, considering the gunk in our local (North Texas) water, am pleased with the 17 months I got out of it. Cleaned it with vinegar weekly (because of the aforementioned gunk in our water) and only use it once or twice a day. Even so, the plastic hinge on the cover disintegrated and it had a removable cover by 6 months of use. This morning (June 2012) it heated water at 0600, and died when I tried to use it again at 0900.No regrets. It worked out to @ $3 per month for the use we got of it. Would I purchase another? No. If our water is going to destroy appliances, I'll just invest in a kettle and use the stove."
1,Only look good,"I will say all other reviewer listed problem I experienced same. On top of that, after 6 month use, the chrome on plastic lid start peeling off and leave greenish copper rust. This green copper rust can't be removed, and lid hing on top of the handle start separated by leaking steam then lid is not able to close. Very disappoint with this product with such high price. Not recommanded for anyone. There are cheapter Kettle on the market and last longer.If there is a less than one star I can rate, I will give to Capresso."
2,Does not last long,"I have had three of these kettles now, and no longer - I'm looking for another brand and model. These kettles look beautiful, but fall apart quickly. We use it a lot, 2-3 times per day. My first one the handle fell off (v dangerously) - just like one of the reviewers noted, then the model was recalled. I received a replacement kettle that worked for about a year, until the top melted. And my last model the metal on the lid and handle are wearing off, and the water looks discolored because the interior is so difficult to clean well over time. I haven't had the bad taste or smell fortunately. But that said, although I love the aesthetics of the design and seeing the water boiling, I'm over it and want a good safe kettle that lasts."
3,Disappointed,"I loved the look of this kettle so much that when the switch broke I paid for the shipping back to get another one free of charge. However, the second one lasted even less time than the first. This time the ""chrome"" on the plastic lid started to peel off then the hinge on the lid broke. Each time I have only had the kettle less than a year. It boils water very fast and if Capresso could fix these flaws I would buy another one tomorrow."
3,pretty but still flawed,"I purchased one of these and it mysteriously quit working after a couple of months. I sent it back and got a new one. The new one worked fine for a little over a year until it wouldn't reach a boil immediately. I sort of blame it on the calcium build-up. I don't mind boiling vinegar water to clean the build-up and i did it regularly (we have well water so it's a given.) I was a little surprised however when the lid sort of disintegrated, came unglued then eventually fell off.maybe these boilers just have a limited shelf life. too bad. It's an attractive thing and we liked it while it lasted."
3,"Looks nice, heats water fast, but broke after about two years...","With normal, daily use, this kettle lasted about two years. It should last longer, considering it is about twice as much money as some of the lower end units. Also, about six-months before it failed completely, the lid broke off. I will be purchasing a different brand in the future. BTW: I noticed no chemical taste other reviewers mentioned. It would be a 5 start unit if it did not break."
2,Bad Smell,This kettle smelled very bad when heated. I thought it might be because it was new and often new itemshave that factory smell. Believe the reviews. I returned this and bought theCapresso 260.03 PerfectTea Cordless 48-Ounce Electric Glass Kettlesince a friend recommended it. It was wonderful and had no smell.
5,myReview,This Kettle heats water fast and has a nice shiny exterior mixed with flat black. The heating element does develop hard water stains.
2,"Pretty, but not durable","I bought two of these kettles and use them in our office. Both started with the chemical smell that others have referred to but either I was luckier in cleaning these or they have more sensitive noses that we do. However, both simply stopped working after about two years of admittedly heavy use (probably 4x/day). Taking the base apart and scraping the contacts to remove oxidation seems to buy a little more time, but eventually these kettles stop responding to that treatment as well. I'm still looking for a kettle that puts no plastic in contact with hot water; suggestions welcome!"
2,"poor build quality, still working after 2 years","I bought this in Oct 2009, and most importantly it's still working. I don't have any issues with chemical odor or taste that others have referred to, but there is a light accumulation of rust on the metal heating element.The workmanship quality of the kettle is very low. The handle was broken in the first couple of months, the lid no longer is attached by the hinge, and the power switch is not functioning very well any more. We definitely use it a lot, but I wouldn't call anything we've done to it abuse. So, 2 stars primarily based on the build quality."
5,Durable and Versatile,"We have had this water kettle for 6 years and use it at least every day. It is still just as good as the first day we got it. We use it for french press coffee, instant oatmeal, tea, and to heat up bottles for our little guy. It isn't much faster than boiling the same amount of water on an electric stove, but it is so much more convenient to just flip a switch! It is a little noisy, but we have been nothing but pleased with this product and are happy that it is still going strong, as we have gotten a few small appliances recently that have not lasted as well or as long."
3,Great looking kettle,"I am someone that makes their own tea at home for myself and my girlfriend and she originally purchased this one because of the look of it. It works pretty well, but it does leak some which can be annoying. There is another one that isn't too much more and it works even better. It is stainless steel which matches the kitchen perfectly. It is also an electric and cordless kettle. You do not have to place it on a stove top. It is all touch (buttons)with a see through center to see just how much water you are boiling. It works even better than the first one and isn't as much of a hassle. Definitely worth the price.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KYSLNQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B003KYSLNQ&linkCode;=as2&tag;=wwwworkoutwei-20"
4,capresso water kettle,"The first time I ordered this product it was non-functional. Quality control issue at the manufacturer. Second order works as advertised. Chemical odor inside pot lessens with repeated rinsing and heating, a vinegar and water solution also helps. The ""chrome"" on the exterior of the kettle is plastic, so I expect that will begin to peel with time. Heats water quickly and turns itself off the moment a full boil is reached. Highly recommend for the easily distracted and memory impaired. A great gift for Grandmother's tea time. Cord is long enough to allow easy placement and any extra cord wraps inside the base unit and is out of the way. Glass urn gives a great show of the water coming to a boil around the heating unit."
1,chemical smell still a problem,"I saw the positive review on America's Test Kitchen (Cooks Illustrated) as well as the negative reviews here regarding the chemical taste/smell. I noticed that America's Test Kitchen was still using it, and assumed that the problem must have been resolved, so bought this in January 2010.Well, I was wrong - so wrong! The chemical taste problem is still present. It appears to come from a plastic gasket around that shiny heating element inside the kettle. I tried boiling multiple pots of water daily for a month. I tried letting it just sit unused with the lid open for two more months. The taste/smell is just as bad as the day it arrived."
2,Lasted only 15 months,"We loved our beautiful Capresso water kettle--until it broke! We used it roughly once per day to heat water for coffee and tea. However, it failed after just 15 months; while the barely-visible blue light would come on, the kettle was still cold.With a multimeter, I found the heating element died and shows no conductivity. (The kettle is surprisingly well-designed and easy to dismantle, as if it were intended to be repaired, unlike most consumer devices.) Since the element is a custom part and the warranty has expired, I expect it will be cheaper and less hassle to replace the whole thing with a Krups, which we hope will last longer."
1,"Capresso - Great Boiler, Bad Chemical Smell","This tea kettle looks great, boils fine, but has a strong, chemical odor that does not go away. Odor aside, I am concerned that whatever causes the smell is polluting the water. This is a huge miss, the manufacturer had to know about this defect. The culprit appears to be the clear rubber ring at the bottom of the kettle that is exposed to the water. As a secondary point, the kettle also does not have a chime when it is complete boiling, as do other kettles."
2,One year later...,"It was a good kettle for a while. Our water is very hard. I will admit that. However, my husband found a crack this morning in the glass and I don't care how hard our water is and how that might affect the glass, that shouldn't happen."
2,Nicely designed...EXCEPT PLASTIC TOP!,"This kettle is seemingly nicely designed, with modern lines. It boils water quietly and quickly. There's one flaw, though, which in our case was a deal-breaker. The inside of the top is plastic. During use, condensation on the underside drips into and contaminates the hot water with a plastic taste. In fact, our kitchen was filled with a burning plastic smell each time we used it! Rather ironically, our main goal in purchasing this kettle was reduce our exposure to plastics and plastic residues in our food. Fortunately, Amazon came to the rescue! After explaining what we perceived to be a design flaw, they emailed a post-paid return shipping label. End of story, but our search continues...."
4,Very convenient & effecient!!,"I love this electric kettle. What a time saver!! I also agree with previous reviews regarding it's appearance as being very chic and unfortunately that it does have a smell at first, but the smell lasted less than a month. I like the glass because I can see when it needs to be cleaned which I need to do about every third use. That is my personal preference because we have hard water and I can ""see"" the residue on the glass and metal element. Cleaning takes less than a minute and is quite easy. I find this electric kettle to be worth it and want to purchase another one for my office. I would have given it a five star if not for the smell issue and the plastic cover."
1,"Beautiful design, bad plastic lid","After used this kettle for 6 months, the plastic lid was broken around the edge and the fake stainless steel coating became peeled off. Then the boiling button dropped, I have to fix it with tape. Considering the bad quality the price is too high."
1,I cannot get rid of the chemical smell!!!,"I have used the kettle everyday for a month. I have cleaned it with soap and water repeatedly. The chemical smell and taste are still present.To think I bought this because I thought glass would be ""chemically"" safer than the plastic kettle I was using. Big mistake. I'm going back to my old kettle."
1,Tea Kettle Lasted 1 Year,I have liked the fast boiling teakettle but it stopped working after only 1 year and 1 month.
1,FYI: Product Recall Aug 2004-May 2005,"Just stumbled upon a product recall (search for ""Capresso Recall"" at Google) for this product sold from Aug 2004 to May 2005. The handle came off. Remedy was to get a free replacement from Capresso. Capresso has a web site. They advise lifting the lid if pouring out all of the water. The site states that the heating element cover is stainless steel (not plastic as one reviewer suggested). The product looks great, but based on the 1-star reviews and the recall, I bought something else."
2,Looks are deceiving....,"I bought this kettle almost 1 year ago. I previously had a S/S electric kettle with a plastic ""on switch"" lever at the base of the unit which broke off. I purchased the Capresso because the ""on switch"" is on the handle and would not break off. This is advertised as having automatic shutoff. This is incorrect. If the kettle is empty you can accidentally switch it on and it will NOT shut off. (I returned one unit and was told it should not do this. The second unit has done the same thing so I believe it is an inherent design flaw.) On several occasions I have attempted to use it and found the unit quite warm as it had drawn power all night after being accidentally switched on. Alas, this morning I discovered it is now completely broken and I assume the motor just burned out."
5,very happy,"I'm a college student who loves a cup of tea in the morning. Instead of wasting my meal plan on the nasty stuff on campus, I can now use this amazing device. It's also perfect for making the instant foods that college kids live off of. I couldn't be happier. The water boils very fast and it's silent and beautiful. I wish the cord was a teeny bit longer, but that's what extension cords are for."
1,capresso kettle 259 off gasses,"I bought Capresso kettle model #259 a month ago. Despite calls to Capresso, boiling water with lemon juice several times and boiling plain filtered water over 12 times, the water still tastes and smells toxic. The smell is strongest from the plastic lid. I bought it in California and I am now abroad so I am unable to return it. I am screwed but would like to warn consumers to be aware of ALL kettles made with plastic parts."
1,Yes.. it does smell bad.. what a waste.. wish I had read the reviews,two weeks now still has a bad smell... I use amazon all the time but from now on I am taking the reviews seriously.... this just makes things taste terrible... I threw out the box so am stuckIt looks so great which is why I bought it..but not putting any water from it into me.
3,Excellent except for the plastic lid,"The design looks good and it heats water quickly. I agree with others that it has a strong smell of plastic which lasts for several weeks. The lid does not detach so it is a bit difficult to clean. it pours nicely. I have had other products by capresso which have lasted for more that 15 years despite daily use, and this product has the same sturdy well made feel. I would give it 5 stars if it did not have the plastic smell which makes me wonder what chemicals are being dissolved in the water as it heats."
5,Perfect,Perfect kettle. Heats up fast (in about 4 minutes) and shuts off automatically so it doesn't boil over. The kettle is beautiful also.
1,Beautiful kettle...but...,"I wanted an electric water kettle. I did the research and even read the reviews...I ordered the Capresso H2O Water Kettle as similar to many others I was concerned about a plastic kettle and this one was chrome and glass with the plastic on the outside only. It was beautiful, it heated the water quickly, the underside did not get hot on the counter....but it had an unacceptable after taste in the water.I am so disappointed, but had to return it. I thought at first it was the new smell of the kettle, but it was not. I used several mild solutions of white vinegar thinking it was again the newness of the kettle...but it was not. It really did cause an after taste in the water....too bad.I called the people I purchased it from 'the secretpantry' and they were lovely and credited me as soon as they received it back.I hope this helps others and someone eventually creates a kettle with no water after taste."
1,Stopped working,"Surprised after reading other reviews that I didn't notice the smell, but then I have alot of allergies and sinus problems so may not have noticed for that reason. Anyway, I was very happy with this product until it started leaking around the seal at the base, and dripping, after about 9 months use. Then a month or so later, it just quit working altogether, other than the blue light going on. Also that blue light is way too dim to see in the daytime, not very helpful. It did turn off automatically when done boiling, but the steam seemed to have peeled away some of the covering on the lid. Very unhappy with the kettle for the expensive price I paid. Guess I'll go back to a nonelectric type."
1,teapot,a piece of garbage! the boiled water tastes and smells like swimming pool water. might be harmful to your body. I have had mind for 9 months. the cover starts chipping. it takes longer and long to bring water to boil. not worth to spend your money on this. look for another product!!!!!
1,disappointed,"We have had this kettle for less than 4 months. Last week, the kettle started shutting off before water boiled. This is happening on a daily basis and is very frustrating especially since sending it back to the manufacturer would mean signficant amount of money on shipping it. Not happy about this product at all."
1,Plastic smell is really strong,"I bought this kettle at a local store before reading reviews. It doesn't smell initially but once you heat up water the smell is awful! Like another reviewer stated, if you can smell it imagine what it's releasing into the water you'll be drinking. It looks really nice and does heat up water very fast - a lot faster than the Toastmaster kettle I've had for years - but I'm sure many/most of the new kettles have a fast heating time. So I've returned mine and am currently looking through my other options."
1,very cheaply made/top comes apart,"I bought two of these kettles. I didn't find they smelled, but after a bit of use the shiny top, held onto the black plastic top which lifts, fell off. There's a tiny, cheap bit of black plastic which is supposed to hold the pieces together, and, despite meticulous care in use, it broke, probably from the heat of the kettle in normal use. After a short time the same thing happened to the second kettle. The kettle is pretty, and has relatively limited contact of hot water with plastic, but doesn't hold up. Don't buy unless you want to replace it every few months."
2,"Beautiful at first, but doesn't last","I bought this kettle for my parents who drink lots of tea. At first I was really mesmerized with this kettle -- I'd literally sit and just watch the water boil. The water heats up quickly and the capacity is sufficient for everyday use.However, after a few weeks, the water began to leave white scale on the glass. I know it's easy enough to clean with vinegar, but is just kind of a hassle to have to keep doing this. After a few months, the fake chrome paint began to peel off the handle. After about 9 months, the inner metal heating element began to discolor and rust. At which point I replaced it with something not as flashy, but more reliable."
1,water tastes strange,"I ignored the negative reviews about this kettle because it looks so good, and some people seemed entirely happy with it. I used it for a week, but the funny plastic smell and taste to the water never went away. It's a shame, because otherwise it performed well. I returned it to amazon and I'm now looking for a replacement."
1,Looks can be deceiving,"I ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic. However, this kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water. I boiled it a few times plus tried the water/vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help. I decided that I didn't want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so I'm returning it - it's not worth the risk. I can't figure out if it's coming from the ""stainless steel"" bulb (that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass & the bulb. Plus the lid has a stong odor too & that is plastic covered in ""stainless steel""."
1,Dangerous,"I had mine for about 8 months and then the handle fell off while I was pouring a full kettle of boiling water into a teapot. I was lucky not to be badly burned. The handle is held to the lid with two small screws that are screwed into plastic. It looks cool, and maybe mine was somehow defective, but watch out (especially if you have small kids who might be in the way of the boiling flood)."
3,"Heats fast, offgassing annoying","Have had this for a month now and it works great. Heats fast, the level lines are nice ( not hard to see for me ), no dripping problems. But the silcone gasket around the heating element is still imparting a bit of an off taste and releases a plasticky smell. It's gotten a bit better but I still don't like it. The 'chrome' appears to be chromed plastic, didn't see that mentioned in description or reviews."
1,Dangerous!,"I paid approximately $90.00 for this kettle in May 2010.I bought it mainly because it looked nice and had a few options for water temprature.Last week I had boiled water for tea and as soon as the motor turned off, I picked up the kettle to pour water in my teapot! The handle came off and the pot itself landed on my counter and broke!!! The kettle broke when it was filled with HOT BOILING water! I was wearing jeans and managed to splash some on my clothes, but because of wearing jeans I only had a red patch on my thigh!I then spent about 20 minutes picking up glass shards and mopping my floor!This product is dangerous! NOT recommended!!!!!"
2,"Beautiful, but the auto-off is not realiable","This kettle is beautiful. I'd have given it 5 stars if the function was as nice as the looks.However, I have often found that the heat has been on all day long without my knowledge because the ""on"" light is not very vibrant. On vs. off is blue vs. green and only very slightly lights up. I do not know why it stays on in the first place. It is supposed to auto-shut-off when it reaches boiling.Suggestions to manufacturer:-Make the auto-off foolproof.-change the color of the ""on"" vs. ""off"" lights to make it VERY obvious when it is still on."
2,toxic smell from plastic lid,"The toxic smell is coming from the plastic lid. The water boils, steam rises, and you get plastic molecules in the water. The water was horrible tasting! Several times I used a baking soda paste on the inside of the lid (setting the kettle carefully in a bowl, on its side), which helped a lot, but I still had to put a teacup cover under the lid to prevent the water from touching the lid. Then I read the review about using charcoal. I emptied 2 capsules of charcoal, filled the kettle with water and boiled it twice. Now the smell is still slightly detectable from the lid itself, but the water tastes fine. A lot of hassle just to get the smell out! The company could have used a food grade plastic and saved themselves a lot of money on all the returns. Could have been a fabulous product.To follow up: I ended up returning this, as the bad taste never completely went away."
1,Broke in less than 2 months,"The seal in the bottom has sprung a leak. Happened in less than 2 months since Christmas. Now we've got a beautiful, non-functional (disfunctional!!!) kettle! Well done, Amazon and Capresso!"
1,Should have bought Cloer,"I bought the glass Capresso kettle but am unhappy with the small switch on the handle because you can't tell if the pot is on. It smells like hot plastic and was made in China; the glass is German Schott. The glass does not cover the heating element. The heating element is a stainless steel (or chrome) dome in the middle of the kettle that sits on what I believe to be a silicon ring. Thankfully, I can get my hand in there through the spout to wash it (I am 5'11"" male). When it dies I will certainly replace it with Cloer."
2,Burn hazard,"I bought this kettle and apparently got one that did not have the smell problems that are mentioned in so many other reviews. It worked great for two weeks. Unfortunately, after that, the mechanism which keeps the lid open for pouring broke so the only way to pour out hot water is to hold it open with your thumb. Even though the lid is between my thumb and the steam, I still get burned if I use this pot. Other than that, it works fine."
2,it only lasted 8 months,"Our water kettle worked well while it worked, but suddenly broke while heating the water one day. the glass shattered without any trauma or impact and all the water leaked out! Never seen that happen to a water heater before."
4,keeps going and going and going...,"We got this just over 2 years ago. I noticed right away that I didn't like the lid - really cheap looking lightweight plastic and it wiggled as soon as we got it. That being said, it has never let us down. We use it many times a day, every day. It sort of reminds me of a car that just keeps going no matter how many little dings and how much mileage you get on it. For the price, I'd say it was a great appliance. We've never had a problem with it, and it is kind of fun to watch the water boil! Also, it's not too heavy when you fill it.Now, after 2 years, I noticed that the cheapo lid is cracking at the spout - I guess it's just worn out! I called capresso customer service and they were super nice. I can recommend this product."
3,Very difficult to use - steam burns your hand.,"Length:: 0:36 MinsI don't like to review anything right after I just purchased it. Now, almost after a year of using this kettle, I'd like to share my opinion. This kettle has a problem - after short period of time the top part of the handle got disconnected from the heat, and steam comes out of that crack. When you are pouring a boiling water from the kettle to the cup - steam burns your hand."
1,Lemon!!!,I purchased two of these and that was a mistake. The unit looks really nice but it is not very easy to use. You have to try and get the kettle just right on the heating element and really mess around with it to get it to work. Not an easy item to use and definitely would not recommend this to anyone for purchase. Just purchased the Saeco kettle and love it. So much better!!!
3,Short life span!,"This kettle worked great (I didn't have any of the problems with an odor, etc.), but after just a year and a half of using it, the water no longer heats to boiling and the automatic shut-off no longer works! The manufacturer's warranty only covers 1 year, so I'm out of luck! What a waste!"
1,Stops working,"We've been using this electric kettle here at our office for the past few months. About 3 months after we got it, it started having difficulty catching the ""on"" position. Now, 4 months in, it doesn't work at all. What a waste! I have the stainless steel Aroma kettle at home, and it's both cheaper and more durable. I'd recommend getting that one instead of this."
1,Reviews are right--horrible smell!,"VERY disappointed with this beautiful electric tea kettle. The smell is HORRIBLE. I have tried and tried to rid the kettle of it with vinegar, etc, etc, to no avail. I feel like I am drinking carcinogens. Like there aren't enough already in our environment. It is a very attractive kettle and works beautifully, but I will have to pack it away. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing!!!"
2,Doesn't last,"I bought the kettle about 2 years ago and use it once a day. It does boil water quickly, and I haven't ever noticed the odor others mention. However, over the time of my ownership of this product, it has gradually fallen apart. First the on/off switch lost its power-on indicator, then the top of the kettle refused to stay open, now the little knob on the top of the kettle has broken off. I've also noticed that an empty kettle will sometimes warm up when it's plugged in, even if the power switch is off...dangerous. Now that I've read the reviews reporting that the handle can suddenly disengage from the hot kettle, I'm going to retire this one and find another brand. I've been very gentle with this appliance, but it just isn't built to last."
2,Good once you properly build it.,"I bought two of these (about 1 year apart) in the last year or so. The first one came with an improperly built base--I bought it online. I had to pull out my screwdriver and take it apart--and found that whoever built the thing didn't properly build it--they left a key plastic part that holds the electrical connector steady against the kettle disconnected. So I got it working and it worked great for about a year.Then the heating element died on it. I liked the glass kettle aspect of this, and this is one of the few I've seen with that feature, so I bought another one from a different supplier (local chain store), and it had the same defect in assembly. The exact same defect. So I again repaired it and it works fine so far.Not much more to say about it, except I don't know why they can't assemble it correctly. I'd probably give it 4 stars otherwise."
2,Chemical smell persists,"This product is not designed well in that you have a silicone seal at the bottom which is in contact with the heating element. As a result, there is a very noticeable [chemical] smell after repeated use although I have not detected any after taste. But, like another reviewer stated, this doesn't make any difference. It's the fact that the seal is probably releasing some chemical into the water that is causing the odor and causing concern for me. I have purchased a replacement product (Krups) that has a STAINLESS STEEL, sealed vessel with nothing in contact with the water. It's a shame b/c it is nice to look at and heats water in no time."
1,Capresso Glass water kettle,i am very dissapointed in this product! all i can taste is plastic! why would you even sell this?Well i guess it goes back to you get what you pay for! I didn't want to spend 200 but it looks like thats where i'm going!
2,stops working after 6 months,"Well, I haven't experienced the water smells like other people have talked about, but i've been thru 2 of these and they only last 6 months max. I bought them locally at store at $70 each, and I'm convinced it's bad investment. If I knew they would go for a couple of yrs, I'd get another since it's been great otherwise."
5,"A perfect little kettle, but one star for Amazon","This little kettle does everything I expected it to when I purchased it, namely, it heats water quickly and then shuts itself off. As a bonus, it looks great on my counter and takes up very little space.In terms of reliability, all I know is that I've had it for over a year now, it's still working perfectly, and it looks like new.For care, about all I do is empty any excess water immediately after I use it and then raise the lid, which allows the inside to dry quickly.One star for Amazon for their usual retail price inflation. Even on the manufacturer's website, this kettle only lists for $59.95, not the $100.00 that Amazon claims."
1,Capresso makes this S/;(T?,"I used to think Capresso meant quality. We've had their high end coffee centers for years, and although the machines are high maintenance, they keep decently well and their customer service is great. Same was true once Capresso and Jura joined forces. Not so with this crappy product. First off, the heating element rusted within less than a month. These were not sedimentation and settling spots as I was told by customer service-- I followed the directions precisely with white vinegar and vigorous scrubbing. While the film on the heating element did come off, the rust DID NOT. That was the major complaint.The overall build of this thing is totally shoddy, too. After several months of use, I ended up with the lid in one hand and the pot in the other (they're supposed to be connected by a screw which ended up in my cup!!)Capresso- I'm really disappointed. My $10 Walgreens hotpot in college was better made!!"
1,Broke down after 7 months!,Beware! I loved this tea kettle until it stopped working after 7 months! The sales clerk in the store where the product is sold stated that he had a lot of complaints about it.
1,My 2nd One Just Failed.,"I'd recommend NOT buying this. I've had 2 fail in the same way. The heating element dies after about a year. Cappresso replaced my first one but informed me upon replacement that they would not replace the 2nd one should it fail also. The pot will heat a little and then stop and then heat a little and stop. It will keep doing this until you unplug it as the automatic shut-off does not engage as it never boils. The glass will stay hot during this process. It's a shame because when it worked it was fast, reliable and an attractive little electric kettle. Clearly there is a problem that the company does not seem interested in fixing."
4,Fantastic Water Boiler,"I bought this item a couple of weeks ago and I love it. It boils water quickly and looks great. However, there are a couple of things that bring down it's rating from 5 to 4 stars.The first being the price. You're paying a premium for a sexy looking product. I don't like paying a premium for looks, but I just can't seem to help myself when it comes to kitchen goods.The second thing is that the design makes it unsuitable for boiling anything besides water (such as heated water mixtures for various recipes).However, if you have the extra cash and drink lots of tea, you can't go wrong with this product."
3,would have gotten a 5 if it kept working...,We purchased this kettle in September 2006 and in December 2006 it stopped working. Capresso warranties this product for one year so luckily we are getting it replaced. When it did work it boiled water quickly and looked great. Just hope the next one will last a lot longer.
3,Glass water boiler (kettle),"Finally, a glass water boiler with stainless steel heating base. This product is beautiful and does the job. No plastic is exposed to the heated water. Sometimes, this kettle remains on even after I take it off its base. I wished it would switch off automatically. It sometimes stays on and empty until I notice weird noise. By that time, it is very hot"
1,definitely a plastic taste in the water,"i bought this kettle from a local store, boiled water in it repeatedly for about a week trying to get rid of the plastic taste/sell. i boiled baking soda, vinegar, scrubbed repeatedly, after a week and probably 100 boiling cycles i gave up and returned it."
1,Must change specification.,"Everything about this kettle, bought 2 years ago, is excellent - except for three things.1. The ""toxic"" smell.2. The severe deformation of the plastic at the top of the handle.3. The denial of Capresso's service dept. that there have been any complaints like mine.I think the wrong plastic material has been used and/or the processing is wrong.This is a problem with buying from overseas: there is inadequate quality control.I told Capresso that unless they could assure me they had solved the problem, I'd buy a different brand when this kettle breaks down."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this product in March of 2010. Although it really looks nice and takes up little counter space, it is very cheaply made. The lid looks like chrome/metal, but it just cheap plastic. I had a feeling it wouldn't last long. I was right, the lid completely broke off last week. I can still use it as I can just put the lik onn top, but pouring boiling water from it is now not very safe. If I don't remember to hold the lid in place, it falls off and all the hot steam from the boiling water goes right to my pouring hand. I've had a couple of good steam burn from it. So, my assessment, for the cost, it is just not worth it. Stick with a good electrice hot water kettle that is really metal and won't break."
3,"Pretty, quick, but short-lived","I am now on my second one of these, because I do like the play value in watching the water boil, which it does quickly. The problem is that the top of the lid is actually chrome plated plastic, and it first gets bubbles under the chrome plating, then the curved top comes off altogether, leaving just an ugly black plastic lid. This happened with the first one too. Then, because the seal is now imperfect, the auto-shut-off is iffy, so if it gets too hot it may not turn on, even after you have added cold water. You have to wait for it to cool.So I'm looking for a replacement for when it finally goes. I'd love for Capresso to upgrade this model to or for someone else to come out with a glass-electric alternative."
4,We love it!,"We love the fact that this is a glass kettle. It is easy to keep clean and there is no concern about a plastic taste, etc. The only concern is that the on/off switch seems a little flimsy, but so far (one month) it has worked properly. The switch moves automatically to the off position after boiling the water, so it is only necessary to handle the switch when turning it on. We love it and it definitely boils water fast."
3,Good and Bad,I like the kettle except for the fact that the chrome on the lid has developed a bubble and so I am not sure that it is real chrome or just an overlay of some kind.
1,Dangerous - handle detachement - this product was recalled.,"I have found out that there has been a recall on this product due to exactly what happened to me - a defect with the handle. Quote from Consumer Product Safety Commission : ""The handle can detach from the glass carafe, spilling hot water and causing severe burn injuries.""After using this kettle for 3 years, the handle snapped off as I lifted it up - and I missed being scalded by sheer luck. If I had lifted it off the counter and the kettle did not happen break off on a basket full of onions, it would have smashed on the floor and who knows how badly I would have been hurt. So dangerous!! The only time you would ever lift up this kettle is when it is full of scalding water - which is when the handle would snap.I contacted the manufacturer, but after asking for my serial number and therefore, knowing exactly that my kettle was defective, they failed to inform me of this recall, and tried to sell me a new kettle."
1,Thanks for the warning!,"I had been looking at this glass water kettle for a few years now and when I first saw this glass water kettle, the price was near $80.I read all of the Amazon reviews and was very disappointed in the way the Capresso supervsior addressed the lady's problem with an ""I don't care..."" The lady spoke to customer service rep about the foul odor/taste and said the rep. was very nice and when she spoke to the supervisor, that's when the attitude changed.I'll be more than happy to boil water on the stove with a beautiful clear Pyrex coffeemaker. I also have a collection of clear Pyrex and Corning tea pots. I just saved myself a lot of money and trouble. Thank you for your reviews."
2,I wanted to love this kettle...,"This kettle was most highly reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, which has never steered me wrong with kitchen tool recommendations. I also had hoped that the reviews on Amazon that mentioned the chemical smell might have been a little overblown. However, they're true. I really loved the kettle design and functioning, but I think the rubber gasket on the base of the kettle is the culprit. Even when the water had cooled off and sat in the kettle for an hour or so, you can lift the lid and smell something vaguely like shower curtain liner. Serious bummer. For the folks at Capresso: replace that gasket with something hardier, and you'll rule the kettle world."
1,Beware Handle Not Polished Chrome but foil on plastic,"This kettle is advertised on Amazon as ""Polished Chrome"" It is polished chrome in color only. It has some type of chrome colored plastic foil overlay on a plastic handle. I've used the kettle for approx. 9 months and recently noticed that the handle was separating right above the on/off switch on the handle, making the switch somewhat balky at times. Closer inspection shows that the ""polished chrome"" is bubbling up and peeling off. When I contacted the mfgr. since it it still under the one year warranty I was told that they discontinued the real polished chrome a while ago. If the handle is only plastic wrapped in foil you can be sure that the cover is made of the same cheesy material as well. I would not purchase this product again, nor would I ever recommend it to a friend."
5,capresso glass water kettle,"I have been a tea drinker forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this new kettle of mine. I found it in a consumer reports magazine while on a "" girls weekend"" and was on a mission to purchase one for myself. I've told everyone how much I love my new toy. Wait time is minimal for the water to boil. I have a piping hot cup of tea in no time."
4,works great after 2 years,"This kettle is very efficient and fast. After reading earlier reports about smells, since day one, it's been used almost exclusively with filtered water, and as a result, there have been no smell issues. I do agree with reviewers that the plastic lid comes apart easily, but some good-quality glue fixed that. The other complaint is that the blue ""on"" light is so faint that it's nearly invisible in a not-so-bright kitchen; a light with more contrast would be a big benefit. Still, it's been a solid performer and boasts an attractive design."
2,"Beautiful kettle, ruined by the smell of plastic","As others have mentioned, the water has a strong smell of plastic. It's definitely the plastic or silicone ring around the heating ball.Too bad, because it's beautiful and it heats up very quickly."
1,Problem with smell and auto-start,"I recently bought one from World Market and returned it. The rubber smell was too strong and did not get any better after cleaning it over and over. Also on several occasions it started by itself so I could never leave it with cord plugged in.We have cuisinart which works great however it brakes down after a while. I went through 2 of them so far. We still have one for upstairs. I bought a Hamilton Beach (SS 10 cup) from Costco for downstairs. It works perfect. I am not sure if it will breakdown anytime soon, but at least it is not as expensive and does not have any foul smell."
1,THE WORST - DO NOT BUY,"THIS IS THE WORST TASTING WATER EVER. For a $70 water kettle, I should expect much, much more. It should be against the law to sell such a disgusting, toxic gadget. Even my husband, who is not in the least concerned with toxicity and who seems to have few tastebuds, will not drink the water heated in this unit."
1,Dissatisfied,I loved the look for this tea kettle and the glass with the view of the water boiling but found that THE LID IS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC NOT METAL. When you boil the water the plastic stinks so bad you can't use the boiling water. Such a shame. I have looked at stores to see if they are all like this and so far all have plastic lids. I also wrote a memo to the company which they did not reply.
2,Foul Odor and Not Reliable,"Like others mine arrived with a strong chemical odor. I bought this, in part, because i wanted to avoid boiling water in plastic. So much for avoiding chemicals. The odor dissipated with time but six months later there is still a faint odor. Looks better than most and boils water quickly but started to malfunction after several months. Turns itself off before the water is fully boiling then turns itself back on several minutes later. The water gets hot now, never boiling. Comes on all by itself so we have to leave it unplugged. Between the smell and malfunctions not reccomended."
1,One Year Later,I loved this kettle and did not have a problem with the chemical smell (as other reviews have commented). Perhaps I bought mine after they fixed that issue?It served me great for about six months so I bought a second oen for my father.SIx months later my kettle began to fall apart. A year later his did as well.Some of the issues:1. Metal heating element ball rusted2. Plastic cap over blue light fell off3. Chrome plastic cap over lid fell offUnits still work but no longer look pretty.At $60 I expected this to last longer than a year.I use it 3+ times a day.
2,"Okay, but then it died","We bought this kettle for it's looks (I didn't like it but my husband loved it, so I said okay) and the fact that you could see the water in the kettle. I was not really happy with it at first but it grew on me and I liked it very well until the painted-on silver handle began to peel and show a cheap plastic material underneath. It was still a workhorse for the kitchen so we kept it of course. After only about a year's normal use the thing just died. It was a disappointment overall and cost way more than the real value of the product. I would not recommend this kettle to anyone. I give it 2 stars for at least working for a year."
2,"Good outside, bad inside","The design is very good, but it starts to smell plastic after a couple of usage. I returned it. Also the description on site was wrong about the size."
1,This kettle switches itself on and wastes a lot of energy,This kettle tales a long time to heat up the water and then continues to turn itself on wasting lots of energy. Now I unplug it every time. Also it does not work with a small amount of water. Poor design overall. I am disappointed!
2,Falls apart,"The silver piece on the lid to the kettle fell off in a matter of 12 months- the plastic piece to the blue turn off light on the handle broke off in a matter of weeks, and the chrom on teh handle is pealing off in a matter of 12 months. I liked that it was glass so calcium was less likely to develope on the inside - however the product is not manufactured well.I would not buy this product again...it easily fell apart on me. It barely lasted 12 months and I hardly washed it."
4,Best of Any,"We love this kettle.....even though it doesn't last long. However, the last time the kettle stopped working, we called the manufacturer and were pleasantly surprised to talk to a live person! They cheerfully replaced the kettle and in record time!"
1,"""Stainless Steel"" heating dome starting to rust.","I have had this kettle for almost a year and small rest spots are starting to appear on the heating element dome. As this dome is advertised as ""Stainless Steel"" I'm not certain of their claim."
2,cheap lid,I purchased this kettle to replace a 20 plus year old english kettle for my wife. The way the kettle operates is top notch.The main issue that makes it a failure is the plastic lids on these fall apart from the steam. If Capresso would make a stainless lid this kettle would be great.
3,Doesn't always look pretty,"It's a great kettle, the glass is very pretty, but the boiling element is visible and builds unsightly white deposit from minerals in water shortly after several uses. I didn't attempt to clean it up, I don't have hard or soft water at home, perhaps use of a filter might reduce this deposit. Overall I am satisfied with the ergonomics and aesthetic appearance of this product. UPDATE: This kettle's plastic warps and breaks after continuous use. Its lid is falling apart. Not durable. UPDATE: mended the lid and had this kettle, used for almost three years. It still works well and has no electtrical issues reported by some."
1,Capresso H2O Plus Glass Water Kettle,"Purchased this kettle before I read all the reviews below. I agree with all the comments posted. There is an odor, however over time it does go -about 6 months. The most serious issue I believe is the handle coming loose. There are two small screws at the top that has come loose. I have rescrewed these but again they have come loose. This is a serious defect as the handle could dislodge and burn you."
3,Cute toy,This toy is very cute and just like the picture. I bought it because we have a rottie at home.
5,The best,This product was recommended to me by my Naturpathic Dr. and it works wonderful. My periodontist was amazed at how much better my gum health was.
3,red in color,will stain a shirt if you get it on it. So when you spit it out if any splashes you will own a new stain.
3,Glyco Thymoline mouthwash,"This item wound up costing me $15 by the time I paid shipping and handling. It is recommended in some of the Cayce info I've collected for the repair of an irritated throat and coughing....first of all, it's the worst tasting stuff you've had in a while...however, we'll live with the taste if it works...still waiting to see positive results."
1,DO NOT ORDER IF YOU WANT VINTAGE STYLE BOTTLE!,"if you like the vintage style bottle, don't order this because it doesn't come in a bottle that looks like the one in the picture!!!! it comes in a really ugly new bottle with a horrible design. i ordered this for a visual project and was really really disappointed. they need to update the picture to show what the bottle actually looks like because it looks NOTHING like that picture. i'm returning it asap."
4,Solid Introduction to moderate neo-orthodox Reformed life,"Dr. Leith was professor for many years at Union Theo. Sem. (VA). Before that he was pastor of some large Presbyterian (PCUS) churches in the South.Interestingly, when he began teaching he was considered somewhat liberal in mainline Presbyterian circles. By the end of his career his theology had not changed but he was considered a little Right-of-Center in the PCUSA. This is testament to how far to the Left teh PCUSA has traveled in one generation.Dr. Leith's book is a very fine introduction to a moderate neo-orthodox approach to the Reformed tradition. He's not an evangelical, nor classically orthodox, but he loves much of the Reformed tradition and has a breadth of knowledge unparalleled in PCUSA circles.This is a good book, and should be in the library of every pastor or informed layperson."
3,Good model ship building book,Lacks many specifics for the beginner but has a lot of useful tips on construction from kits
1,Not worth the money,"Remove the Italian / English dictionary, use normal print instead of large print, and the book would be half its size. The hints and tips are somewhat lacking. A very big disappointment."
4,Ship Modeling Simplified,"I found this book to be a good primer on model ship building and worth reading for the novice builder such as myself but its a little disorganized and has some mileading steps in applying planks to the bulkhead or frame of the ship, they just seemed to be short cuts or cheats on doing it right. But all in all a good read and recomend it to any virgin ship buider! I found Ship modeling from stem to stern by Milton Roth more up to speed for me as i am 44 and have a lot of experiance working with wood. There is a vast amount of imformation out there for the model ship builder which is a blessing to us all. Ship Modeling Simplified was the first book i purchased on this vast subject and i can say i was not disappointed it is a great first read!"
4,excellent for beginners,"as im just starting out, about halfway through my first wood model. this was the first book i bought. it was very helpful, but much of what is in it is common sense. i havent gotten to the rigging though, so it may come in a lot more handy. it wont tell you all you need to know...but its a good book to have on hand."
5,Good lamp,Ok. I looked up this lamp because I needed to get a new bulb for it and wanted to see the spec. Then I saw the 1-start review.This is a great lamp. There is nothing cheap about it. I've been using it for over a year. It is better suited to light an area than to use as a reading lamp. This should be obvious to anyone who actually looks at the lamp. I does what it is clearly designed to do very well. I have no issues with the switch being cheap or malfunctioning. It works perfectly.
4,Bigger than original battery,"Yes the replacement is bigger than the original, but it also holds a longer charge. So it really is a good deal, and you can't beat the price."
2,The battery does not hold the charge long....,I has happy to see that the battery was bigger than the one replacing (1000mAh). The old one could last almost 5 days without a charge till it got older. The new one runs out of juice in 2 days with a full charge. May be a bad unit?
1,Great seller!!,The extended battery is wonderful and the price was great!!! the shipping was extremely quick.Thanks!!
5,Excellent source of boat building instruction and motivation,"As a person looking to choose a boat building method, I found Sam Devlin's book extremely interesting. After reading his book, I felt confident that I could tackle such a project and was inspired by his personal love of the craft. As a matter of fact I purchased some of his plans and found Sam and his wife to be extremely friendly and helpful!"
5,Easy Boat Building Concepts thoroughly explained,"I have read this book several times. He has a clear and logical way of presenting the stages of construction. His web site is informative and his video is equally as instructive. In terms of a complete ""How to"" series, I only wish other disciplines were as good.In addition to the quality of his construction, I am particularly fond of his designs. Most other stitch and glue plans lack the elegance of Sam's designs."
1,Fooled by a Photo !,"Okay. One star means ""I hate it!"" but, in fact, it is not the product that I hate! (although this wallet will be hard-pressed to expand to a full 5 inches)! I saw 2 items in the photo and saw the description ""Wallets"" which I understood to be plural (more than one)... and deduced that there was One Set of 2 Wallets per order. Now, that is a good deal! And what do most of us come to Amazon.com for? In part,a good deal!The Walletttt! came in a nice sized box with packing. Excited to finally complete a pending project I ripped open the carton to find one,stiff and lonely accordion wallettt :(Will I return it? No. This worn-edged stiff excuse for a deal will be filled and I will think twice about another similar purchase from Amazon.com."
3,Good book on organizing tips,"This book has many good tips to help a person get organized. Lots of useful information to be found in this book. No stories, just tips."
1,Freud Saw Blades are Junk,"The first 10 or so cuts with this blade were good, but it didn't live up to the hype. After six month's of limited use I went back to the dewalt blade that came with my saw. The Freud was so dull it wood not cut anything. I only cut wood and did not abuse it. I ended up replacing the Freud blade with a 60 tooth Dewalt and it makes as clean of a cut as the Freud when it was new and the Dewalt is about a third of the cost. Bottom line is that I am very dissappointed and this is not the first time I've had issues with Freud products and will stear clear in the future."
5,Fascinating,"Although somewhat repetative at times, this book is, overall, enlightening. Evidence from a broad range of scientific disciplines is displayed clearly, and the relationships and connections between subjects are elegantly exposed. This leaves the reader with a feeling that the basis for the ideas presented is solid and tangible, making the book all the more immersive. Exposition of some lesser-known studies which never the less have incited serious scientic revalations is perhaps this book's strongest point. This book serves as a jumping-off point for many avenues of thought, and is highly recommended to anyone who seeks to further their understanding of human intellegence, social behavior, and consciousness."
1,Couldn't stay awake,"I bought this based on an article in Entertainment Weekly. They said how great the car chase was and was a ""must see"". Yawn.....I knew going into it that it was the original and made in the 70's. I'm thinking - cool, kinda like Smokey and the Bandit. NOT!! The one cool factor was that they only used one car unlike most movies (including Smokey and the Bandit where I think they used at least five Trans Ams). I kept waiting for this awesome chase scene and fell asleep during it - it was just lame. The story, the sound, the scenes....all bad. Don't waste your time on this one!"
4,Oldie but goodie,I got this for my husband for Christmas. It was refreshing to see the original movie. Remakes of such movies today aren't as good as the original. Thumbs up!
3,Old Flick,"Not for me. I bought it for my Son in WI, He said it's OK,Compared to newer version, the first is the best!"
5,"Retro Breakfast: Memorable Meals Morning, Noon, or Night","This a is great and fun recipe book if you like breakfast food, however if you love retro and breakfast you will love it, I do."
2,impossible to cradle,Im sorry but this phones design is terrible. the talk button is so large and sticks out so much that if you try and cradle it between your shoulder and chin while talking you will likely hang up. sometimes just walking around with it in my hand I inadvertantly turn it on. its a big pain and will be returning it for a different model.
3,Serve the purpose--gluten free,These are okay. Almost taste like a non-food--cardboard comes to mind. But they are serviceable if you want something to put a sandwich on.
4,Weird and wonderful,"Hoodtown is the wrong side of town. Bad things happen there. Faust writes a completely believeable alternate world where Hoods and Skins battle and a Hood's ultimate pride is keeping on her mask. When someone breaks this sacred taboo, all hell breaks loose. There is a compelling mystery here among the oddball setting. Faust writes fight scenes like no one else. They ain't pretty, but you can smell the sweat.If you like Faust's other work, you won't want to miss this one."
5,I want to live in Hoodtown!,"One evening, I took a nice hot bath and cracked open ""Hoodtown"" with the intent of reading the first two or three chapters. Next thing I know it's two hours later, I've finished the book and my bath is now ice cold. I woke up the next morning very, very sick. For this, I blame Christa Faust. Her book is impossible to put down. There's not enough space to go into plot details (see book description above), but let me tell you that Ms.Faust has created a completely engrossing world of masked heroes, serial killers, midget pimps, savage violence, and rough sex. Once you've finished the book, you'll want to visit Hoodtown to buy some churros, a souvenir mask or some hot masked lovin'. ;)"
4,Nice to see some spirituality,"Was wonderful to see the characters depend on spirituality for a foundation in life. It clearly illustrated the conflict, the decisions and the conclusions. The thoughts of the characters made it easier for the reader to relate to a sadly popular occurance between couples. The relationship between the children and their spirituality was also evident when the idea of religon was introduced during a time of crisis. All the while, encouraging a family unit as well as independent growth.The plot was intriguing and kept the reader guessing as to which one was the main topic. Definately a summer read!The only way to improve this book would be to offer a little bit more history about the supporting characters. Although it may not contribute to the plot, it would help give a more rounded picture of the group of friends. This may help other use this book as an example of a support group and may provide a shimmer of guidance and hope to those in such a situation."
3,Formulaic,"There was little about this book that I found gripping. I did read it through to the end, and I enjoyed the Nova Scotia setting. The story involves a pregnant young woman who disappeared nine years earlier, and the detective and grandmother who continue to search for her. In a parallel story line, it also involves two mothers and their nine-year-old daughters. You suspect, of course, that one of these is going to be the the woman who disappeared. I found her reasons for disappearing interesting, and liked that element of the plot, but little in this book came to life for me. It seemed formulaic."
4,Makes me want to visit Nova Scotia!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was an easy, interesting, heart warming story. Though it touched on the sad issue of emotional and mental abuse, it didn't leave you feeling depressed and forlorn. I enjoyed reading about the beauty of Nova Scotia and the whale watching adventures and if it were a real place, I would love to visit! It was interesting reading about Rose's heart condition 'tetralogy of fallot' and the factual aspects of her heart defect woven into the book. I liked the characters and the storyline. It was not intense and gripping and overly dramatic, but I enjoyed the plot. A good book."
2,I dont usually read these kinds of books.........,"and now I know why - *yawn*. There was nothing at all thought provoking or even mildly interesting in this book. But I felt I had invested so much time, I had to finish it. The only redeeming thing was the mildly interesting twist near the end. I felt sorry for both the women - victims of domestic violence - but the characters were not really developed enough for me to greatly care. I was interested to find out the mystery of the missing pregnant woman and when it was seemingly figured out, the story lost all appeal to me. I'm sure this would be a great book to some (and the beginning of a series, I assume) but it wasn't my cup of tea."
3,"Interesting, but could have been better","It was both interesting and disappointing at the same time.I checked out the book in a library, and I was bored, so I started reading it. It's amazing that I managed to complete the book. It says a lot since I don't finish more than 20% of the books I start reading (beyond the first chaper). So that says a lot about holding my interest.But some stuff was repeated way too many times. You will see ""Tetraology of Fallot"" about 50 times, and each time, it's as if you never saw it before.The ending was rushed, and incomplete. Which, I would have felt much better about the book if it didn't feel like the beginning of a sequel. I hate sequels."
4,Very Good...,"There are 3 episodes on this DVD.In World Adventure Dora and Swiper travel to four different countries(France,Russia,Tanzania and China)to return the friendship bracelets Swiper has swiped.In Journey to the Purple Planet Dora and Boots meet five space creatures and travel with them to help them find their way back to their planet.This episode was only shown very few times on Nick's Dora series.My three year old granddaughter really likes this episode and watches it first.The third episode is The Golden Explorers which is the name of Dora's soccer team.They win their match against the other team which consists of very large dinosaurs."
1,not the best episode,"The world adventure teams Dora with Swiper--that's right, as friends. Their mission is to save ""Friendship Day"" by replacing the bracelets that Swiper had swiped. It is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn't visit ANY country where Spanish is spoken. And what's more, the plot is really boring. Nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid. The songs that Swiper and Dora sing together are LOUSY. Nothing about the songs is catchy or fun.Another odd thing is that Dora's voice is different. It sounds like they couldn't get the same actress they normally use to do Dora's voice. Dora sounds older.There are a lot of fun Dora videos out there but this isn't one of them."
5,McKenzie Airback,"This is a great travel back support since one can blow it up and then let out the air and roll up. I also like that I can blow it up more or less depending on the seat I am sitting in. I also use it at my computer chair at home. I think the dimensions need to be stated. I thought it was going to be half the size than it is. So I will state the dimensions....15-1/4"" in length at center and 6-1/4"" in width at center."
1,"Nice idea, but quality is junk","I used this with my office chair for 3-4 days, then it sprung an irreparable leak. Once you see the product yourself, you will understand why leaks are bound to happen under any normal use: it's two flat sheets of some vinyl or vinyl-like material joined by a narrow 2mm heat-bonded seam. The seam is (unsurprisingly) too weak to withstand the force of being pulled apart when the inflated roll is put under pressure.I bought this because it was inexpensive and some reviewers left positive reviews, which in retrospect is baffling because it doesn't seem possible that this thing could last for very long for anyone. I gambled that the other negative reviews (which mentioned the leaking) were simply the result of people getting random bad copies. Well, seeing the construction myself, I concur with the other negative reviews."
5,All the difference for long flights,"This product is part of my regular travel package and is as important as my passport. I rarely travel without mine. I have used these for years and typically end up giving them away to my friends and customers who travel frequently and end up in great pain from their trips. I now by five at a time and give them away in addition to always having one for myself.In actual use it rolls up flat, and I can adjust it for the different type of airplane seats and comfort level needed. Only downside is that after a year of constant use the seams will often fail and start leaking. Then it is time to get a new one. As mentioned above, I carry spares."
1,Arrived defective,"Pillow arrived with a large leak in the seam. Needless to say, I am not impressed with the quality."
2,Too slippery,"This cushion is easy to inflate and deflate, as well as store and pull out to use at a moments notice. It also seems durable enough. The big drawback is that it is made of fairly slick material that slips easily out from behind the small of my back. I have to keep retrieving it and rearranging it. I wish it were made with a non-slip type of material. Otherwise, it would be pretty useful."
5,Don't travel without this,"I blew out a disk in my back and my physical therapist recommended this pillow. Being a guy, I wasn't super comfortable with carring a little pillow around with me. It's worth it, even if you look like a sissy. I flew to China, and I probably would have been in a wheelchair had I not had this pillow."
1,Worthless,"The Airback lost its ability to hold air almost instantly. I have not isolated where it is leaking (valve, seams, or simply material), but it began leaking after very few uses. It has to be re-inflated multiple times on even the shortest car and plane trips. I would not purchase another one of these items nor would I recommend anyone else purchase one."
1,Loved it until it failed after only 6 weeks,"This air pillow provides an adjustable amount of support, and was very comfortable under my back all night. I used it while sleeping, and loved it when I first bought it. But, here we are 6 weeks later, and the pillow is leaking air at an increasing rate. The nozzle looks fine, so maybe it leaks along a seam. I'm extra bummed, because it is made in USA, and I always expect good quality from us. Today I bought the OPTP Pillow which is also made by McKenzie. Costs twice as much, so maybe it is better made. Got my fingers crossed!"
5,"Simple, comfortable, portable, customizable, affordabe, what more could you ask?","I just received and am using the McKenzie Airback. It's simple, comfortable, portable, customizable, affordable and as long as it doesn't develop any leaks, I'll rate it 5 stars and may buy another. Sure it has a inflation valve that sticks out but this does not get in the way."
4,"It does leak, but so what?","I've had it a few weeks and like others mentioned it does leak. But, so what? You blow into it and its back to working fine.I'll try it on a trip to Europe next week and update this review if it fails in any way."
1,Deflated too often,Air would escape from the roll whenever I put pressure on it (i.e. behind my back). It would deflate within 5 minutes of inflation.
1,Flat most all of the time! Better off with solid version,"Will not retain air !Better off with solid roll which cannot leak and is more comfortableDon't buy one!I have the self-inflating one by same co. That is shaped like a dog bone and it is excellent, portable, and does not leak."
1,3.5 months and done,My Airback sprang a leak (see picture) about 3.5 months after I began using it. Until this happened I liked it. It was comfortable and easy to adjust. Time to find an alternative!
5,Best out there - please keep making it!,"I couldn't wear eyelashes until I found out about this glue. It is really good and I love it which means they will now probably stop making it. Nooooooooooo! Unlike other glue, this does not get that dry scratchy feel during the day. There is something in it that keeps it flexible and it doesn't feel like you need to pick it off. It's that same quality that lets you clean off the glue from the lashes at night and thus you can get long use out of the same pair. I got really good results putting the glue on the lash when I read about the method makeup artist, Carmindy, of What Not to Wear uses. She puts a dab of the glue on her non-dominant hand and then using tweezers runs the edge of the eyelash strip through that. For me this works like a charm! [...]"
1,review,"i dont see anything great about this product, the glue does not hold well and ever since i've bought it i tried to use it but couldn't cause it does not work for me."
2,Better as a reference,"I used this book for an undergraduate math methods for physicists course. While in the class I found it very difficult to learn anything from it, as it is rather dense. I found that most websites I looked to for help cited the book though. Now I find this book to be a very useful reference. It's definitions are fairly concise and topics are not spread throughout the book. Bottom line: great reference, poor learning tool."
5,Great undergrad physics major book!,"This undergraduate text makes Arfken really accessible. The new examples are great and most are from various fields of physics. This has helped me in my mechanics, E and M, and quantum mechanics classes. The long index is complete and really helps to find things quickly. The chapter on probability & statistics explains concepts especially well."
2,Made for a very gullible audience.,"Though this is billed as the latest in a series of ""hidden camera"" movies, half the time everything appears staged. Frequent attempts to make non-Spanish-speaking foreigners the butt of the jokes suggest that the filmmakers think the audience is made up of naive xenophobes. Made me long for Cantinflas."
5,Really Nice,"Shipped fast and works well. My Mom is 5'2"" and on the shortest setting it fits her well. The only thing is every couple of months the screws start coming loose so when you get it stop off at the auto parts store and ask for some lock tight. Just a dab on the screw and it helps keep them in place!"
5,Too Wicked To Love,"He is Ethan Sinclair, the Earle of Chasebourne, the most notorious rogue in all of England. She is Miss Jane Mayhew, the keen-witted spinster Ethan had never even noticed. But when Jane discovers his love child abandoned on her doorstep, she is determined to see him face responsibility."
3,How do I describe it?,"Hmmm, while I liked the ""love"" part of the story, I couldn't keep thinking that the heroine should just mind her own business and not try to take over everyone else's life. In truth it became a bit annoying."
1,possible subtitle: too stupid to live.,"Not enjoyable.Plot summary:Spinster finds abandoned infant, assumes it is the offspring of local badboy. Spinster demands badboy support child, while leaving infant in spinster's custody. Huh? Badboy wants child, doesn't want spinster. Smart badboy. But not smart enough. Spinster knows best: an infant needs a mother. Notorious badboy is seduced by manipulative, creepy spinster. Will badboy be compromised into marrying creepy spinster? Will creepy spinster live happily ever after?So who is too wicked to love?Yuck, this heroine is more dishonorable and unscrupulous than a dozen evil rakes. Truly frightening in her arrogance. The hero is a snarling schmuck, who thinks with his other head. These are not endearing, intelligent characters. The infant is a feeble plot device, used when necessary, then quickly forgotten by the author.My recommendation: Skip this one."
3,I Hated the Heroine,"I would have loved this book, just like the rest of B.D.S's, if it weren't for the heroine, Jane. She is so pious and prideful. I generally love the prim spinster, bad rake romances but not this time. Jane is too extreme for me. And I lost any respect for her whatsoever when she traps Ethan, the hero, into marriage, just like his horrible first wife did. Ick! I just felt she was a big jerk throughout most of the book and almost couldn't bear to read it through. Unfortunately, I am one of those people who must read a book all the way through, even if my fists are clenched and my teeth gritted."
3,Wouldn't Order from this Supplier Again,"Bottles were not in the 2 pack as described. Shipped as 2 separate bottles and the bottles were both bent in. Product was still usable, just not in condition that wa described. Had planned to use as part of a Holiday Gift and didn't since product was damaged."
3,OK sound - great convenience,"I live in the Seattle area and there are very few dead spots on the FM dial. That being said, the Transpod is capable of producing fairly clear reception. I suspect it would preform better in a market with fewer radio stations using up the FM bandwidth. It is very convenient and I frequently use it in each of my vehicles. The sound quality is acceptable, but not great."
2,Disappointing,"The product performs as desired save for one huge flaw. There is a coil inside that vibrates with the side of the case and circuit board. Using the supplied solid mounts, this means you hear alot of annoying vibration. The unit is not very substantial in feel. Unless you have your music cranked all the time, or have a very noisy vehicle, you will have a constant annoying rattle."
1,Stupid,This product is so stupid it is a disapointment to apple and I am not even an apple fan. However I love the ipod but this product does not do it just. I can not even drive a 25 mile stretch and listen to 2 songs because of all the interferance and static. They must revise this product and make it work before having the nerve to sell it for 99 dollars retail.
3,Bulky time piece,"Got this watch for my Brother in Law as it looked damn attractive when seen online. It looked good when i got the package too. But its bulky. Watches which are too bulky seldom are preferred for daily usage. So, this just became a show piece than a worthy piece."
2,"This is a cassette, not a CD","The songs are Nellie Mcness, Barbara Allen, Lolly-Too-Dum, Dublin City, I'm Sad and I'm Lonely, Turtle Dove, Cockle Shells, Saturday Night."
3,looking for this old collection:,"hi there,(i dont have this cd, im just looking for info; ignore my rating--had to put something in there..)when i was a kid (early 80s) there was a collection of folk songs at my library. it looked old then, i would guess that it came out in the 60s or 70s. im trying to find it. there were about 5-6 records (i think) and burl ives talked about the history of each song before he sang it. id really like to find a copy of this. does anyone have any ideas??! .....a burl fan"
1,Anybody????,"I may be interested in buying this cd. Has anyone purchased it? What is the sound quality like? Are these original recordings? I notice several reviewers saying there were no song titles listed. Now that the titles have apparently been listed, has anyone got a copy of this particular disc? I'd like to know what you think!How was the product delivered? Did you receive it quickly?Anybody???????"
2,Seller was Dishonest,"I was happy to receive my purchase but was more than a little disappointed when the book advertised as ""New"" was in fair condition at best. The price was cut in half when I brought this to the seller's attention, but I could have done without the hassle. I cannot help but feel that the seller was dishonest."
4,It's really BIG,"3 things you should know:1. You need to buy the adapter to fit the lens to your camera.2. It's bigger, heavier than you might expect. perhaps too awkward when attached to a pocket sized camera--like my A620. If you are going to be walking around taking pictures with this lens you might consider some kind of neck strap or harness. The lens/adapter is easily removed, but then what? Better have a shoulder bag or huge pockets. This lens weighs as much and takes up more room than the A620.3. Don't expect to use the built-in flash, the lens will block it.It helped me take some great pictures--no complaint about that!"
4,Canon WCDC58N Wide Angle Converter Lens Adapter Review,"The adapter is great. No issues, and the shipment was received in a very quick time-frame.The lens blocks the flash on the Canon G6, but other than that, the pictures have turned out great! It was all that I was hoping for."
1,Worthless!,"This adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my A700, so much sothat the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identicalto that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens.Thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter. Canon, normally aresponsible firm with many excellent products, is beneath contempt in marketingthis lens. I called Canon customer service and spoke with a sympatheticrepresentative who took the matter up with ""someone else"". The outcome was thatthey admit that there ""is very little increase"" in the non-vignetted field of viewby using this adapter. She said she would put my comments on a company-internalproblem compilation called ""customer voice"". I can only hope it reaches someonehigh enough to do some good!"
1,Worthless is right!,"This lens attachment is worthless for the A710 IS. As the other user stated, the non-vignetted portion of the captured image is not any larger than an image without the lens attached. That is, once the dark circle edges of the image are cropped out, the image is no larger than if the lens was never used. No gain, money spent. This is a major OOPS by Canon, and no help or compensation was offered by them. Bad service, bad product, bad marketing. Two thumbs down for CANON!"
4,Nice product,Company did an outstandig job in communicating w/me and the packaging and shipping was very fast too. Wish the return policy was one where the customer was not liable to pay for shipping. The price was a little high.
3,Great photos,"This book had great photos, but not what I expected. I was looking for more American type photos. The cover is misleading."
1,good book not good condition,"book had pages falling out of it from where previous owner almost totally ruined the spine,had i known that pages were not securely in book i would not have purchased it"
5,Excellent!!,Simply excellent. Anyone who is interested in nature or creation MUST read this book. Very informative and artistically captivating.
4,"Superb, excellent and well thought out.","This book provided me with some of the best photographs I could ever want relating to ""Locks"" and the various styles, the people who wear them and the reasons behind them. I found it to be a wonderful aid in my own spiritual journey to grow my locks. You will love this book!"
4,Good for coffee!,"Excellant book. As one who has carried locks for quite a while I can say that it's nice to see the photos and words of others who share this part of theirself with others. Dreads are beautiful and deeply personal; to explain them is not always easy, to understand them, it seems, is often even harder."
2,Pretty Pictures lots of inaccurate fluff,"I started to purchase the book that is until I read it. The authors are obviously unfamiliar with dreadlocks or locks and can only view from an outsiders view point. If you are truely interested in gaining info about African American hair and its spiritual, historical, and political ramifications go elsewhere. Dreadlocks among Africans did not start with the Rastas our culture and historical roots go much deeper. It is extremely arrogant to profess the cultural beginnings of another group and intertpret its actions. Go to the source."
4,Dread Lock Journey,This is a good book. It has helped me on my dread lock journey to see that many cultures around the world also share my enthusiam for wearing them. My hair dresser has it on her counter and now I also have it on my coffee table. It's a good read.
4,Excellent read.,"This was an interesting and excellent read. I received a deeper understanding of the origins of Locs. Often associated with the Rastafarian, the book gives an enlightened account of the religious ramifications and of other cultures embracing locs and the non-cutting of hair mentality. I enjoyed reading why many embrace this hair statement. The pictorial account was excellent as well."
4,Wonderful resource in this technical age.,"As a US Navy First Class Bos'n Mate, this book is a fantastic text for keeping our arts alive and accessible to the novice. This will be my second copy as the first was 'pinched' by a colleague. I have completed at least four of the projects with great results(yeah, yeah, tooting my own horn. I know). H.G. Smith helps define beauty in simplicity, form truly follows function."
3,This was a gift,"I chose this because my dad wanted a book to learn to make a sea chest handle. I looked over it a little once I gave it to him, and it seems like the instructions are not as explicit as I would like for myself. For example, sailcloth...unless you are a sailor, how in the world would you know what's comparable to this?! It's one of the requirements for building these chest handles, so I'm sure he'll figure it out, but having examples of what other cloth would work may be more helpful."
2,The Marlinespike Sailor Blues,"It was an alright book with some history to back up the use or origin of the knots, etc. I had hoped for something more unique and practical but that was not to be. It was a bit of a rehash from other books."
2,What the what???,"This is a book for experts. But why would an expert need instructions. I would have loved to be able to have learned so many of these knots and projects, but there is simply not enough instruction for a beginner. Nice illustrations, sure. Maybe for collectors???"
2,Very out dated,With the exception of some pages that have been added in the back on braided rope this book is horribly outdated. The newer section is just reprints from Sampson rope splices which are available on the web. Unless you are restoring an old square masted sailing craft don't bother.
3,a bit of irritation goes a long way,"I have no one large criticism of this book; however, the author has the irritating habit of sprinkling this volume with too many maritime terminology and sailor slang with which most of us are not familiar. I do not appreciate getting up every few minutes to look up an archaic or highly specialized term whose usage is rare and in a fairly isolated environment.For an instructional book this is not helpful. People who know this terminology probably know how to make the knots already."
4,Fun to read but not a how-to book,"Pros: It's well written and fun to read. It's full of historic information and anecdotes. The illustrations represent a wide variety of interesting projects .Cons: The book is very uneven. Some projects are explained in details with patterns and step-by-step diagrams. Some have little or no explanation. I also noticed that some knot-tying diagrams are inaccurate and near-impossible to follow.I recommend the book as a fun and engaging overview of marlinspike seamanship, but if you want to learn the craft, this book alone is not sufficient."
5,Worth its weight in Salt,"In a category with few other references, The Marlinespike Sailor is the go-to guide when you have time for fancy work projects. The step-by-step illustrations are nicely rendered and the descriptions and lore are amusing. Any REAL Bosun's Mate should have a copy in his possession. Its one of those things you don't pull out too often, but when you or a friend need a good ""how-to"" for making a coachwhipping or a plaited sennit, its priceless."
1,The Marlinspike Sailor,"The name implies the art of marlin spike ropework, it has some interesting history (as they all do) but lacks with any of the detailed drawings or photos necessary for most people to follow the nuances of certain knots. The cover promises so many beautiful creations but the instructions are fast and vague as to render most items worthless to even follow. It was a waste of my money."
3,Physics and psychotherapy,"If you love science and psychotherapy this is the book for you.I found the only really interesting parts were when she spoke of her clients and their inner journeys and epiphanies. The other material, and it felt as if it was 2/3 of the book was a bit dry for me.I gave it three stars because of the following story:""A man approaches Picasso at an exhibit of his work and says with great exasperation,""Why can't you paint more realistically?""Picasso thinks for a minute and says, ""Realistically, I guess I don't know what that is.""Frustrated, the man takes a photograph from his billfold and says, ""Look! Like this. This is my wife.""Picasso takes the picture in his hand and looks at it. ""She's so small,"" he says, and turning the photo sideways, ""and so thin!."""
1,Fantastic song! Too bad they messed up the CD single.,"This is one of Enigma's best songs in recent history. The album version has an infectious groove that will make you want to move to it. The only problem? I haven't had a chance to listen to the CD single yet.Unfortunately, the CD-single contains the ""copy-controlling"" technology that can cause problems with certain car CD players (mine is one of them) and if you want to listen to this CD on a computer (while at work, for example) you are required to install some kind of player software first.Since I am not allowed to install software on the PCs at work, I am unable to listen to this CD in the car or at my office, two places that I enjoy listening to music to. Because of this restriction, and the fact that it has prohibited me from listening to the music that I have purchased, the rating is 1 star (the music may very well be 5-star worthy, but if I can't listen to it, then I can't rate it :-/ )"
4,Vintage Belafonte,Great early stuff! I remember this when it was a 33 and I was 12. Long ago. Some familiar classics and a few really special tracks you won't hear anywhere else. You gotta have it - check out the price!
1,don't bother,"If you liked her CD ""Warm Heart in a Cold World"", (which was pretty cool acoustic music, with great songs that were interesting and worth hearing) don't bother with this one. There's nothing here but a wanna-be Lisa Loeb/Alanis M."
3,It's pretty good.,"I think they are great musicians, but this CD didn't grow on me as their other one's."
2,Not for untreated well water!,"If you are using this for well water, please note that right on the packaging when you get it- in the left hand front bottom corner- that it should not be used for untreated well water. I am not sure what else you would use if for. I used this filter years ago when our well was new and I do not remember there being such a warning.One might want to go to the 10 micron or finer size for well water and expect to change it more. I use the 10 micron filter from the same company and like them very much over the years. The 4.5 micron is also good but requires frequent replacement when a well is new or there is a lot of rain.I was hoping to use this as we just put in a new well pump and there is a lot more sludge in a new installation, but I am hesitant to use it now due to the explicit warning."
2,Bad Taste,We have city water but sometimes have sediment in the water when they flush the lines. This filter removes some sediment but left a bad taste. I went to the 5 micron filter and it works a lot better for a little more money.
4,KATELAND,"EXCITING..Its night time in New York, And i am right in the centre of "" TIMES SQUARE "" With a perfect view of the ever changeing lights and sounds. And loveing it. Im looking at the many large neon signs that flicker and change, just the colors of them all is amazeing. There is plenty of action here, and i have this feeling that im right in the middle of the road, with cars everywhere, and yet i know that im not going to be struck down by a vehicle, IM SAFE. This is a very busy place, you hear all the natural sounds of traffic, and see people going in all directions, its all rather exciting. There are many people i know, who dont realise this DVD exits. When i tell them, they will want to purchase ""TIMES SQUARE"" DVD too. Sit back, relax, and watch the world go by in front of you. ENJOY YOUR NIGHT IN ""TIMES SQUARE"""
5,Satisfied customer,Very satisfied with both the service and book. It was used but in very good condition.
4,Review,"If you have seen the excellent Korean drama,Korean TV Drama 2-pack: The Grand Chef Vol 1 + Vol 2with Kim Rae Won as Sung Chan, you may want to pass on this movie. Both were inspired by the same Hur Young Man comic and 'The Grand Chef' (alternatively titled 'Gourmet') far surpasses the movie version. As 'The Grand Chef' is one of my favorite Korean dramas and I think Kim Rae Won is fabulous as Sung Chan, I couldn't really get into the movie other than at the very end. The casting is very different between the two versions. Additionally, the plot line and characters were not really developed in the movie version.If you have not seen 'The Grand Chef', I think this film may appeal to those interested in Korean culture and traditional Korean food. However, I would still strongly suggest you see the drama as well. It will definitely leave you looking for the nearest Korean restaurant or cookbook.Bon Appétit!"
2,fits but sticky,"The case is perfect for the cameras listed but the velcro is stuck on with glue and the glue is constantly coming off thte sides of the flap. It got so annoying, especially when the glue started to get on my s400 and my fingers. I returned it twice and will have to find something else."
5,excellent quality,"This case is soft to the touch, yet sturdy and fits my S230 like a glove. It's easy to get the camera in and out, and it doesn't take up too much extra space in my purse. It is excellent quality and very reasonably priced. I only wish I'd bought it sooner. No complaints, I just love it!"
5,I dropped my camera from 6 feet in this case and it started right up!,"In spite of reports to the contrary, this case is very well padded due to the very thick, well-crafted leather. I dropped my camera in it and had no problems afterwards! As for the ""black speckles"" this is the 2nd S410 I've had in this case and I have never had any such problem.The strap fits through an eyelet - very convenient. The belt loop is great as well. Memory cards and extra batteries should be carried seperately, as this case is designed for on-the-go portability and not as a carry-all."
4,As an owner of a Canon S230 Elph,"I don't actually own this case (because it wasn't available when I was looking for one) but I have the PSC-300, which is a dark blue suede-like material case made for the S300 and S330. My camera fits nicely into the PSC-300, and it has a front zipper pocket with enough space to store extra compact flash cards and a battery. If you own a S200 or S230, don't care about the leather and want extra storage space, the PSC-300 may be the way to go."
2,Try a Pentax case,"I found that the SD500 fits snugly in the original Pentax PTX-L40 case, as offered by J&R. On the Pentax site they show a different case for the L40, maybe they changed it, but the one shown at J&R is the one I tried - and it has a small pocket for an extra battery and memory card."
3,"nice case, but fits camera only","designed to match your compact powershot camera, very stylish. do not purchase this case if you are expecting room for an extra battery or CF card."
2,wore finish,"although it protects to a degree, it wears the finish off the camera, which in my opinion isn't much better than having scratches all over. i would not recommend this case as a method for protecting your camera."
2,Not recommended,"After a year of use, I tossed it out as the velcro on it could not stick anymore and I got tired of its basic function. It tightly fits the camera and thats it. Good for a night out, not for travel. I guess I would recommend for the look of it if you are not on travel...but definitely not recommended for your next trip abroad."
5,Just Right,This fits Canon SD 550 perfectly. Easy in and out. Smart Looking. Good Leather Quality. Protects the Camera very well. I am glad that I bought it.
4,Got what I expected,"I bought the case for my SD400. The camera case is sleek, compact and the leather is soft which provides adequate protection to the camera and does not make the camera bulky! You can fit an additional memory card in the case, even though, there is no space provided for it.Con: It is not big enough to carry additional batteries.Overall, the case serves its purpose!"
2,eh...,my boyfriend bought this for me not realizing that my camera came with a case (i have the SD200). this case isn't a good fit for the camera and i've never used it because of that.
1,BAD SERVICE-DO NOT SHOP HERE!!!,"I ordered the camera case for the Canon Digital Elph 450. And I was given a completely different one. Prices sound great, but they do not deliver what you buy. Had a bad experience with them."
4,Works like a camera case should,"Clean, nice looking case, and it fits the camera perfectly. I would've preferred a belt clip instead of a belt loop, but my wife comandeered the camera anyway, and her purse doesn't seem to mind."
4,nice overall,"The case is nice, it looks solid and protective. It fits nice on the belt but it's a bit too loose for my SD400."
3,Impractical Option for the SD400,"I looked at this case for my new Canon SD400. Three major problems with the three Canon cases I looked at (Coach, PSC50, PSC90):1) They attach to your belt with the camera vertical. A horizontal mount is much less intrusive.2) No room for an extra battery. With no battery life indication on this Canon model I want an extra battery with the camera always.3) They either are very expensive looking (Coach) or have a metal Canon logo on the front. This is a big sign that says steal me! The metal logo tag is also prone to scratch things.My previous camera and case was the Canon S330 and the soft case made for it. It had a perfect size pouch for a spare battery and I removed the metal Canon logo. Alas it is no longer available.I bought the Pentax PTX-L40 for my new Canon SD400. It is a perfect fit in all ways. The embossed Pentax logo is subtle."
3,It is not what I wanted..........,"I wanted the camera case to be SOFT Leather, but it is NOT. It is hard. I wanted to it to feel like a nice pair of leather gloves, this leather case is bulky, does not fit in my jeans pocket. I wanted something to protect my camera from scatching that's all , I wanted a super thin soft leather pouch."
1,PSC -50 case,"We ordered the PSC-50 case for our Cannon S330 and after receiving it, it did not fit. Be careful...."
3,Canon Soft Leather Case,"The Canon PSC - 50 Soft Leather Case is quite handy. However, I was hoping it had an interior lining to further protect camera in the event of a fall."
2,very loose,"the color was acceptable, however the size was not fit enough. Therefore, the camera case will look not elegant as I thought."
4,good case for this camera,it is hard and small so it is easy to carry around and protects the camera if dropped. the only drawback is that it has no pocket for an extra battery or memory card.
4,Great Case,"Positive:-Small, Fits the S200 & S230 Models snuggly.Negative:-Not much room for much else.This case was made to fit the Digital Elph S200 or S230 (same size). I don't know if it a S330 would fit in it or not. It has a nice soft interior to protect the ElPH's LCD, the viewfinder lenses, and the metal finish. Since the batteries and CompactFlash cards are so small you can put fit those in the bag too. If you don't need a hard case for your s200 or s230 camera I'd get this one."
2,"No pockets, wore finish on camera","I got this case when I ordered my Canon SD110 (excellent camera). The camera fits inside and for the money I get the case gets the job done. I was a little disappointed there wasn't an extra pocket for memory cards or anything. My major issue with it though is that it seems to have worn off a good deal of the finish on my camera body....well, either that or it's leaving something ON my camera. I wouldn't recommend this unless you absolutely need a case and don't care how good it is."
1,What a mistake,"When I first received the case, I was excited. It was small, compact and fit the camera like a glove. I thought this would be helpful to carry in a purse when you didn't need extra batteries or memory cards. After having my camera in the case for awhile (for storage), I took out the camera to charge the battery. I was very disappointed because there were black marks all over the camera and they would not come off. I read this from another review and should have listened. I just threw the case away. It was cheap and past my return time. I would not recommend this case unless you don't care about the appearance of your camera."
3,Case for Camera only,This is a good Camera Case for Canon Cameras. Just fits the camera. No room for any other camera related stuff. I would have been very happy if they provided some space to carry a canon battery and SD card.
4,Good Book,"Good Book, came to me in great shape. Very informative. Great customer service on arriving on time."
1,"good phone, but NO CALLER ID.","good phone -- interfaces well with the other RCA phones we have -- BUT -- this one (model 25413) DOESN""T HAVE CALLER ID. The picture is WRONG -- it won't display phone numbers, it won't display caller ID. SUPER irritating that one model will do that, and one won't."
5,Excellent service,The order was shipped and recieved next day. WOW!!!The item was just as expected brnd new and we hope it will work as great!This is an amazing service.Job well done!
1,Complete Garbage!!!,"Just like the guy below, the bag is too small for an acoustic bass. I can just squeeze my bass in there, but I won't leave it in for any length of time, because I'm afraid it's putting too much pressure on the neck and will cause damage to the instrument. I wish I had never spent money on this, but by the time I ship it back, it's not worth it. I also ordered a strap for an acoustic bass from Musician's Friend which was also too small. Makes me feel like I'm playing one of those big mexican bass guitars real high on the chest. How does such a huge music company sell stuff this bad?"
3,Decent attempt with insufficient means.,The introductory part about Math is bad and unprofessional. I would rather recommend to take some real course/textbook in linear algebra and analytic geometry. Then one may read specific gaming stuff from this book.
4,Very complete textbook for game math,"This textbook seems to adequately cover all the major formulas used for game engines pretty well. It's not easy to read, but then these are difficult concepts. I showed this to my upcoming professor, and he was impressed; ended up making it the required textbook for the course."
2,Kindle Edition is a rip-off,"This is a great book, however, with the Kindle version being priced only 5 dollars less than the hardcover, one would expect that you would get the same value.However, you do not, as the CD-ROM that is included with hardcover is not included with the kindle edition. This is an issue, when for instance, you look up line segment to line segment, and find out that source code isn't listed in the book to save space. This doesn't make the book worthless, but it makes it pretty worthless.If you are thinking about getting the Kindle edition - don't. Get the hardcover edition instead."
1,Talk Button is in the Dumbest Place,"Reception is great.Features are great.Nice phone to look at.But there is one lurking design flaw that dooms this phone. The Talk button is round and big and sticks out just enough that if you rest this phone on your shoulder for a millesecond, you hang up on the other party."
2,Dissapointment,"I thought this was a huge dissapointment. Not only are there WAY better tent campgrounds all over Oregon, the author did not even seem to look around for them. Silver Falls Park? Oxbow? Really? These are places jam packed with people! Don't rely on this book if you want the ""Best in Tent Camping Oregon""...just do some research and you'll find that Oregon has WAY better spots."
3,not the best,"This is a nice review of established campgrounds, most of which are crowded and noisy. Sorely missing from this book is any mention of the more remote places you can camp and really get away from it all..."
1,Huge Disappointment,"We planned an entire camping trip around the recommendations in this book and were sorely disappointed. ""Yellowbottom"" campground WAS paved, was cramped and there was no privacy whatsoever. We ended up in a Forest Service campground fifty miles away that was better by far. I don't know what the author considers spacious and private...but this campground was crowded, paved and lacked any of the reasons my wife and I go camping. We burned the book in our campfire."
1,WARNING: DO NOT Trust Amazon's Filter Guide,"Don't make the same mistake that I made and trust what Amazon's fitment guide tells you. I made that mistake and as I type my wife's 2011 Ford Explorer (3.5L engine) is sitting in the garage with an empty oil pan and no oil filter. Why? Because I mistakenly trusted Amazon's guide and ordered this oil filter several weeks ago. Now that I tried to install it - including filling it half way with fresh oil as one should do with a new oil filter - and guess what? It won't thread. I examined the old filter (a Motorcraft OEM filter from Ford), and the threaded opening is 1/8"" smaller on this Bosch than the OEM. Gee, I wonder why it won't screw on? Duh. Thanks Amazon for costing me more money and wasting my time, plus making a huge inconvenience."
4,Very fun,The book is such a fun book to read. It is one of those books that you cant ever put down. You will feel like the characters are your new best friends because you learn so much about them
4,A Fun Read,It took me awhile to actually get into the story but once i gave the book a chance I really liked it.It was a fun read and worth my time.I hope other people feal the same.
1,ALF-,"I've always enjoyed the show, glad i got series, but was disappointed with the missing episodes and cut....Hope it gets re-released with correct episodes...."
3,ALF SEASON 3 & 4,"I was pretty disappointed in both season 3 and season 4. Season 3 kept jumping from Kate being pregnant to Kate already having the baby and vicaversa. The episodes were clearly not put together in order. As for season 4-- they had a few episodes from season 3 mixed in, even ones with Kate being pregnant!!! I just wish that someone would have gone over the episodes before putting the discs together. I feel we got jipped on season 4 especially since there were not nearly enough NEW episodes!!"
3,excellent but why syndicated episodes,What a blast from the 80's past! I worshipped ALF as a teenager and still love it. Why syndicated episodes?
4,Good for laughs,"I love this show. I was so excited when they were putting it out on DVD because I thought all I had were memories. That being said, I too was very disappointed in Lionsgate for putting episodes in Season four that were already in Season Three. Like none of us would notice? I highly recommend purchasing the DVD set anyway because ALF will always be great TV, just don't be disappointed if you get part way into an episode and say ""I've seen this already..."" and it's not because you recently watched it on actual TV."
3,What is with the repeated episodes that were on season 3,"I give the show 5 stars but the DVD release only 3. I know what you are thinking, he is giving 3 because of the syndicated version, but no. THe reason I give 3 stars is because of the repeated episodes from season 3. How disappointed I am with Lionsgate. I wish someone else owned the rights to release this show in its entirety, in its correct order and with no repeated shows from previous seasons."
3,Missing Episodes and repeat Episodes.,This Has repeat episodes from season 3 and missing episodes. The Show was very funny. It's to bad they did such a bad job with the dvd's. Someone should have previewed the dvd's for errors before they published them.
4,Funny,"Id written a review for season 3 and now I am onto season 4..I am more than half done with it but have watched enough eposides to make my rating..so far there has been 2 episodes that were on season 3! also same issues with Kate being pregnant one episode and not pregnant the next..short hair one episode , long hair the next.. whoever put these 4 seasons together dropped the ball with the repeats and it not in succession. all in all funny and cheap fun! I love Alf!"
3,Repeat Episodes,"I enjoyed this season of ALF. However, there are 3 episodes on this dvd season that are also on season 3. I purchased all four seasons at once and two of the four season dvd's have problems. I am usually happy with my purchases from amazon but this is one I am not happy with."
4,"Alf Season 4 Review, Great Show, Bad Ending","This last season is great and still remains as funny as the earlier 3 seasons of ALF. For some reason there is episodes from previous seasons on this collection, doesn't make sense... and I also noticed the episode order is incorrect, as it was in season 3, one episode pregnant, next baby born, next no baby at all, next pregnant...Still the video quality and sound quality is as expected, and the easter egg is a little naughty but still funny, great menus but sucha poor ending :("
3,Great introduction to astrology,"This is an inspiring and entertaining book. Both astrology lovers and beginners will find it useful. The case for Astrology the author makes is interesting, but one has to wonder whether the stories he tells are true (they are really amazing coincidences). This is an excellent intro to astrology in a short number of pages, but I have a hard time believing the case for astrology, and feel it muddies the water instead of making a helpful case for science over art. That case is just a fraction of the book, so those interested in learning or reading charts will find it useful but personally I could only give it 3 stars."
2,"Not easy to find things, but handyto have anyway","This little book is handy, although the foods are not organized consistently with regard to alphabetical vs. categorical listings. Nevertheless, it includes enough info to estimate the blood glucose impact of many foods, and that's helpful."
4,One Of the Simplest Body Books,"This is a good book about the body that preschoolers love. It's not complicated, but still answers the qustions. It has questions like, What do you see with?, and What do you hear with? It has nine qustions and a colorful pop-up at the end."
1,Bad,"This tarp is in good confection, but the seller said is 5 mm. tick and is not is basically as a paper, with the first wind the tarp broke and practically destroy. Defenily I not recommend this tarp and I will never shop with them again."
1,REALLY,telescope is alright needs a barlow lens definitly if you want to see anything worth while. the shipping was horrible supposed to get here in 3 to 5 days took more like 10 days. i also orderd a moon filter that didnt get here till 3 days later no point in looking at a full moon with out a moon filter. i know its not the companys faul for the delay in shipping but i missed the full moon because of it. They sould of shipped it Fedex instead of UPS. aAny ways another thing i dont like are the slow motion controls they are cheap they feel like drinking straws. just horrible I bought this product because of its high reviews. but i am dissapointed. my first look at the moon was like what?? it looked so tiny. needless
4,"starblast,4.5","Rhe starblast 4.5 is an awesome starter. Being able to see the moons of jupter and the detailed craters of the moon, is what your looking for the starblast 4.5 is for you. Orion has many upgrades to make your viewing even easier."
3,A nice beginner telescope.,"Not the best thing going, a bit shaky and a bit loose where it would be nice to be tighter. Would be great if they gave you more lenses too."
5,Great starter!,I bought this in May for my birthday and took it out to the coast with my friends and family. We had a really great time with it and it worked well as a starter scope. I'm not sure I would see much reason to upgrade as I'm not much of an enthusiast. Great to settle basic desires. It wasn't too difficult to assemble and I was able to do it in about an hour.
4,Nice,"Have not been about to take it outside (cold/cloudy) to see stars, However, it a beautiful piece. Hope to try it out soon!"
4,Go for the complete set,"When you are talking about Robert Johnson, alternate takes are not just alternate takes. This is a genious of the highest order, that was barely captured on disc, in a world then ruled by Jim Crow. Therefore, you want to listen to every single note he put on record eventually. Besides, many of the alternate takes are completely different than the released versions, sometimes different rythms, different words, and some alternates are even better than the released versions. I dont see the point in these King of the Delta Blues CDs when you can go for the Complete 2 CD box set."
4,"""The brain needs oxygen""","""this type of thinking(could do us in)"" is a very solid cd. although some tracks (like 2 or 3 of them) cant keep your attention, all the others definanly make up for it. my personal favorite is ""the clincher"".a very solid song where ull find yourself singing rite along with him.also i like ""get some"",very well written,Vitamin R(arguably the best song on here.and also ""still running"" and Breach Birth,(a very bad title for the song).overall this cd isnt perfect but definantly worthy of 4 stars and your money."
3,"In response to the ""manythings711"" review","I like chevelle and have since point #1 came out, but that is only because they sound so similar to the best band around today, Tool. Pete's voice is similar to Maynards, not because that is how he sounds, but he goes out of his way to sound like that. Chevelle has made it very clear that they love Tool and strive to sound like them. After listening to their new cd it is impossible not to hear how certain tracks from Tool's Lateralus Cd influenced them on some of their new tracks."
2,Kudos...............To their studio anyway!,"The only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 is that they have a good studio quality to their sound, and the drummer is ok. Had to double check to see who this was again, after awhile all of these bands start to melt together into one giant pile of poo. I will give them credit for one thing they hide their overt ""influences"" to put it mildly, fairly well. So do yourself a favor go out and pick up Suicidal Tendences first album, Tools opiate, or Undertow. Anything by the Melvins,orBad Brains. This should get you started on the right path."
4,Good Album that shows off band's potential.,"For those of you eagerly awaiting the next Tool album, this is a great way to keep yourself in the mood. Hint's of Tool abound even though I would have to say that this is a little harder. On Track 10 about the 3:15 mark, when he say's ""Search for Truth"". It have to be one of the best Primal Screams I have heard in a long time."
4,One of the Best CD's I've heard in awhile,This CD is just plain SOLID all around. I wish I could give half star ratings because I would give it an additional half star and make it 4 1/2 stars. Not to knock it but its tough to get a five star CD in my book now adays. I have to admit I like any and all types of music but I favor the heavier stuff on certain days. This one has been helping me get through a pain in the rear commute though. I haven't been able to listen to any other CD in my car accept this one as of late.
3,It's pretty cool!,"The first few tracks on the album are awesome, however as the c.d. progresses they become more and more average. But once youget used to it you'll really appreciate it more. Deffinitelybetter than the last one!"
4,WOW! I'm Impressed!,"This album shocked me. I heard this album over a friend of mine's house and liked what I heard. So about a week later (in fact the day of the chevelle concert about 20 min. from my house), I went out and bought it. After listening to this cd for a few days, I fell in love with it. I like almost every song on the cd, which is rare now days. This album is very good, so if you don't own it BUY IT.P.S. - I was stupid and didn't go to the concert, and they came back about a month ago, and that show sold out before I could buy a ticket - BAD LUCK!"
4,Great Album,"Great Album from Chevelle, I was really surprised with the way their sound has innovated itself. I first discovered them back in 1998 , I was playing PS2 ""Road Rash 3D"" when I heard MIA the first time. Since then I have always thought Chevelle had a great sound. Then they really surprised me with ""The Red"" and the album ""Wonder whats Next"" . I was so surprised that that was the same band that did Point #1. Anyways the songs are awesome on this album. My favorites areClincherGet SomePanic Pronethose are the best ones. You should definitely check it out, its really worth it"
5,Chevelle IS my Vitamin R!!!!,"What can I say? Chevelle kicks! The guys are Hot, the music is great, and the guys are hot. I wouldn't at all compare them to Tool or A Perfect Circle, even though they are two really good bands. I have all of the Chevelle albums so far, and I am happpily impressed with each. 'This Type Of Thinking Could Do US In' was well worth waiting two years for. CHEVELLE IS MY VITAMIN R!! \m/ *0* \m/"
4,"Chevelle's best, so far.","Chevelle's third album shows just how much the band has grown. The songwriting (lyrical and instrumental) has greatly improved. I am very impressed with this CD, to say the least. I found their first CD to be quite boring at times with the repetitive riffs and obvious ""Tool"" influences. Their second CD was an improvement, but not something that I enjoy listening to very often. However, with ""This Type Of Thinking..."" they have definitely ""hit the mark."" Every song on this CD is a gem. At a time when most hard rock bands pretty much sound the same, this CD is definitely a breath of fresh air. Chevelle has developed into a sound all their own while still maintaining the original sonic qualities that made them so popular in the first place."
4,Polished Sounds,"Chevelle's New Album is far more polished then their previous outings. They've lost a bit of the indie rock roots, but will probably gain a wider mainstream audience with more tracks that are airwave friendly, ""Vitamin R"", ""Panic Prone"" and ""Emotional Drought"" being the most notable. There are still some harder stuff on the album for those who loved Wonder What's Next. ""Breach Birth"" and ""Still Running"" being good examples. Pete's vocals definitely take more of a Maynard Keenan(TOOL) sound to the forefront on this one which is good and bad. Good: because the lyrics get a more emotional boost. Bad: because they end up sounding a bit too much like a Tool copycat.The overall effect of the album might be a disappointment to those purests of Chevelle's first albums, but Pete, Joe and Sam still know how to rock out when it counts."
3,Ehh,"I knew what I was buying when I bought it.... there's nothing wrong with the CD.... but it was supposed to be brand new... I don't know if it's a matter of shipping or what, but the jewel case was cracked. Ultimately, I suppose it doesn't matter, but it kinda sucks to get a ""new"" item that you paid for and find it cracked right out of the box. I was definitely disappointed."
5,The Extras RULE!!,"Ok, we know that this cd is really extremely well done and deserves the praise for this album sounding so good. What else could make this cd better? Well Chevelle put alot of extra stuff on this cd such as the whole album being preformed in studio and a couple videos one being never before seen make this worth the money for this again. Overall once again its awesome and I know if you like Chevelle you'll like this cd/dvd."
4,Much better effort,"I really liked Chevelles first album, but was very disapointed by Wonder What's next. I bought this album with the intention of giving them one more chance. I think they are finally living up to their potential as a band. I still think they can do better, but that just gives me something to look forward to next time they have an album come out. I definately recommend this album."
4,Wonder what's next?,"This!!!! This is a great album. Very chilled, yet also heavy. Great combination of both. I think this is a definite step up from Wonder What's Next."
2,Tool lite.,"Hey Maynard! Call your attorney!Chevelle sounds like Tool. When I say that, I don't mean that Chevelle was ""influenced"" by Tool, or that you can hear some Tool here and there in Chevelle's music. I mean Chevelle has appropriated, ripped-off and otherwise completely stolen Tool's sound, from the vocals down to the guitar riffs. Unfortunately, they decided not to swipe the underlying tension and menace that usually lurks in Tool's material, and this is the type of thinking that could do them in...I'd guess that when their recording career winds down, they'll at least be able to book themselves into 2-bit clubs as a ""Tool tribute band."""
3,c'mon...,"this cd is pretty good... ""clincher"" rocks balls and their first single ""vitamin r"" is very listenable. but, and as i say this i must admit i like both this album and Wonder whats next, their first album is much, much better. point #1 is ""dirtier"" (as opposed to the clean stylings of WWN and their new one). i love chevelle, but if you want some good s$*t( i.e. harder stuff like ""clincher"", ""family system"") pick up point #1."
4,its just ok,this album is just ok for me. it would be pretty good if they hadnt came out with wonder whats next. wonder whats next was a very good album.
1,Looks like it was designed for a different camera,"Did not like this one bit. This is a nice leather case for the G5. Problem is that it blocks all the functions behind the camera and restricts usage to the view finder. I believe that the view finder is one of the weaknesses of the G5. This case amplifies the problem by allowing you to use only the view finder. If you want to use the LCD screen you have to take that case off !!!!!Do not buy, unless you would like to use the view finder only.I ended up getting a generic case."
3,Good camera protection but inconvenient to use,"The camera case fits my G5 perfectly and is a great way to protect the camera. However, it's not convenient when using the camera. I need to remove the camera from the case to take photos, but there's no way to keep it attached so that I don't loose it. In addition there's no pockets or slots to keep anything, specifically extra memory cards. But, if you plan to keep your camera in another bag, such as a big purse, it's great to ensure the camera's protected."
1,Huge DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"My husband ordered this case for me for Christmas along with the Canon G3. The camera is EXCELLENT, but the case seems like it's for a camera with attachable lenses, not the G3. There's easily a half an inch extra space in front of the lens. The rest of the casing fits snuggly as is appropriate. It's odd to have this extra long camera snout sticking out with rattling space."
3,LIKED IT ALOT,"My first Suzanne Macpherson was ""Switched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" and I loved that so I decided to try this book. It was not as good as the first but I enjoyed it none the less. The story line flowed well and the characters had great imagery. But towards the end it started moving too fast and then it was over. It was a good read especially for only .99 on my Kindle app for Android."
2,I can't believe the reviews were so good...,This book was not good. I could barely get through it it was so boring. I didn't see the attraction between the two characters. I thought the main male character was weak and had few desirable qualities. I would not recommend this book!
3,Book Review,"The book starts out like an old private eye movie. I wasn't impressed. It got better as the book and story went along, but I don't know if I'll read another by this author as I don't feel the book was a real page turner."
1,This is NOT a bra.,"This is a foam in the shape of a breast. That is all. I got the D size and wouldn't even fit half my breast. The adhesive seems weak, but then again, if it didn't even fit I wouldn't expect it to hold the weight. I gave them to my sister (she's a B) but I don't expect her to wear them. It's just an awkward thing. If you need a backless strapless bra, get the ones made out of medical tape that are shaped like a U. I have the ones by Fashion Enhancers but Fashion Forms also has them. Now THOSE are a GREAT invention!"
2,WHAT??,"Okay I knew this cream was a bit of a placebo when I ordered it but it does NOTHING! No warm feeling , menthol, no tingle...NOTHING! No I tell a lie, it provides a bit of lubrication but thats it. Save your money."
3,Good for a few minutes,"It was great for the 15 minutes it took for my mid-sized dog to destroy it, and she isn't even a dog who likes to chew or rip toys apart. She did enjoy it while it lasted though."
1,Poor Customer Service,Two (2) of the tubs arrived damaged in shipment (cracked). I wrote the company an e-mail and explained the problem. It has been four (4) to five (5) weeks and I have received no response.
2,Came in Unreadable Condition,Sorry for the bad review but the copy I received was Dog earred and water damaged. It was not in the condition described.
3,A little short of greatness,"I was probably more excited over release than any others when it first came out. I was a long-time Odin fan and expected the same from Randy O on this release. What I found was the album had moments where he sounded like the guy I knew on songs like ""Cryin' Out"" and ""Right on Track"", but then ventured into some bluesy stuff like ""Seaside Lover"" and sort of lost me. It is definitely worth a listen, but not quite what I expected."
2,"Let's say 2.5 stars, and that's pushing it","By now, i'm sure everyone knows Randy O. from the film, The Decline of Western Civilization. I won't rehash all that and bore you to tears, but I will say this, this album leaves alot to be desired. I tried, but honestly, I can't figure out how the hell these guys get a record deal??Some of the songs on Lost & Found aren't awful, but honestly none of the songs off this record leaves an impression. I always try to find the silver lining when it comes to hair-metal albums. I can't help it, i'm addicted to the stuff, but i'm sorry, there wasn't much here.I would recommend this album only if you are a die-hard late 80's/early 90's hair-metal junkie. Other than that, I would pass."
3,"The ""decline"" continues","Lostboys was an average (at best) hair metal band that featured former Odin frontman Randy O. You may remember him as the guy in the assless chaps from Decline of Western Civilization Part II: the Metal Years. Lostboys also features members of Armored Saint and Alcatrazz. The band comes across as a sleazier version of Cinderella with scratchier vocals. No real surprises here. There are a few decent tracks as well as some truly awful ones, but for the most part this is just another basic hair metal album that should appeal only to the most die-hard fans of this kind of music. Not surprisingly, 1990's Lost and Found was the band's only release."
1,This album sucks.,This group was started by the former singer & guitar player from Odin. You may remember Odin from The Decline Of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years. They made asses of themselves in the movie and even bigger asses of themselves on this record. The singing is horrendous. Who told this guy he should be in a band.
3,popcorn popper is flimsy,I bought this popcorn popper because my father had one like it when I was younger and my kids loved it when they were little. But the one I received from Whirlypop was made of aluminum and seemed very flimsy. But so far it has made good popcorn. I'm just not sure of its durability.
5,You CAN use the Whirley-Pop with a glass/smooth top stove!,"The Whirly-Pop needs constant heat to work well, and several people have had problems with glass stove tops being scratched (I haven't had this issue) or not providing enough heat. My solution: Preheat a skillet on the stove, then put the Whirly-Pop on TOP of the pan! The pan, if it's heavy enough, will retain heat for even popping and protect your stovetop! Voila, delicious popcorn!"
3,"Alright, Not as sturdy as I'd hoped",Got this when the plexiglass top on my existing popper broke. It works great for normal popping. But I like to add sugar too (carmalizes the popcorn) This causes the plastic gears to skip. It isn't quite as robust as I had expected. But overall its just okay for the money
5,Fun Popcorn Popper,"I finally decided to purchase one of the Whirley-Popper's & I really am enjoying it. It's not as heavy as I thought it would be, but I still like it a lot!"
5,Great Popcorn,"I had a stove top popcorn maker that looks identical to this one for about 20 years before it finally began to disintegrate. I was disappointed when I saw this one as the pot & lid are a thinner metal (aluminum). But it did pop much better for some reason. I don't believe this one will last 20 years but so far, so good."
4,Great Popcorn,This Whirley popcorn popper is really great. From start to finish is 5 minutes or less. Only thing is the metal it's made of could be a little heavier. But it still does a fabulous job. Glad I got it. Also was a good price.
2,"Not for the dishwasher, takes up space, wears down quickly","Okay, this is a nice tool IF you- have all day to wash dishes (because it has wooden handles it's not possible to put it into the dishwasher without ruining it)- have a very spacious kitchen (you basically need a whole shelf in your kitchen cabinet to store it, and you can not put anything in it while storing, that would bend the 'whirly thing' inside)- have no problems buying a new one about every nine months (since it is aluminium it dents easily, it deforms under high heat and the (soft) material abrades during use, leaving more or less toxic residue in your popcorn)Overall, it is a nice little tool if you like to show off your 'style' by being a nonconformist, but if you want to have a practical, efficient, and smart tool, well then look elsewhere, your schedule/wallet/health/comfort will thank you."
3,It does a good job,"I like the fact that it gets most of the kernels to pop but it's difficult to clean. I just bought a electric one that has the ability to be taken apart and cleaned. I love it, only use non-GM popcorn - search for Amish popcorn on the net.....:)"
5,Great popper,"This is my second one, I wore the other one out after many years of popcorn. I love my whirley-pop."
4,happy poppers,we use our popper all the time and love it --the only complaint we have is that the handle squeaks when we turn it..
2,very cheap construction,"I bought this Whirly Pop for myself after I bought a Back to Basics brand of stovetop popcorn popper for a gift. I like the other one much better. Whirly-Pop is very cheaply made. I can't even scrub the pan clean and the clips on the lid don't stay on tight, so the lid keep coming off while I pop the popcorn."
1,Poor quality--Plastic gears subject to melting,"This popper is very thin, light-weight, and low quality. The gears are made of plastic, which can melt. I bought it to roast coffee in, but I'm certain the gears would melt after a couple of uses, so I am returning it. I would recommend spending a few extra dollars and buying an all stainless steel popper. It's much heavier, has steel gears, and will last much longer."
2,Love - hate,"We loved the popper the first four times we popped. Very tasty popcorn! However, it fell apart on the fifth!! And it's been 10 days over the return expiration date. Boo! Now what to do with the 50 packages of popcorn I purchased to go with? Very disappointed kids (and mama)!! Dare I try again?"
3,Plastic gears come off,"My family has purchased two of these poppers, along with one of its predecessor model, the Felknor popper. (Whirley Pop acquired Felknor a while back.) These poppers make superior popcorn, especially compared to microwave popcorn. However, the Whirley Pop poppers use a pair of plastic gears to connect the crank shaft to the stirrer. They are only pressed on, and on BOTH of the Whirley Pop poppers we have, the gears come off on a regular basis. I slide them back on the crank shaft, but when it happens during the popping, there's a lot of steam and heat to burn you. The older Felknor unit has metal gears that do NOT come off the shaft."
1,Shame on Wabash Valley Farms,"I had to replace my ten-year old Whirley-Pop when the plastic gears became so worn that the mechanism would no longer 'whirl.' My new popper arrived last night and as I removed it from the box, I thought, ""This is awfully light. MUCH lighter than my old model. While the pot is okay, the lid is ridiculously thin - any thinner and it would qualify as foil. And, the 'whirler' (or whatever) doesn't fully touch the bottom, thus the corn was not being stirred and started to burn. And yes - it's now made in China. So why is it still so expensive? And why isn't Wabash enforcing stricter quality control? I'm embarrassed for Wabash if this is the best this 'heartland' company can do. A real shame!"
1,Beware the plastic gears,"We had another brand, very similar, and used it for a couple of years. Two weeks ago this one arrived, and just yesterday the plastic gear that drives the stirring mechanism split in two. I recommend getting one with a metal gear on top rather than the plastic one."
4,Makes great popcorn,The flavor is by far superior to microwave popcorn. And it's a fun activity for the kids. Just be careful when opening the lid. The steam gets extremely hot. Almost burned the skin off my fingers. I'm never buying bags again. Gave it four stars only because I can't really comment on the quality since I only used it once. Appears a little flimsy and doesn't seem like it's going to last too long.
5,This is a great item!!,"This popcorn popper reminds me of my childhood because of the old fashioned cranking handle. This design allows you to use much less oil than usual, and still deliver delicious popcorn. Also, by turning the handle throughout the entire process, the popcorn will not burn on the bottom of the pan. I think that any popcorn addict like myself would really enjoy this item!"
4,Whirley-Pop popcorn popper,"This product does the job. I was a little disappointed that the stirrer does not stir the kernels well before the popping starts, but have not had any problems with burning. I just shake the popper occasionally before popping starts."
4,nice popper,"I have one of these kind of corn poppers and it's heavy...this one is made the same but is lighter weight material...got it as a gift for someone for Christmas, so hope they like it!"
2,Broke after first use!,"The first time I was making popcorn the plastic gear on the top completely shredded when turning the handle to keep from burning-yeah it burnt! Couldn't turn and threw away the popcorn and the popper! Should've lasted longer, it would've been a nice popper."
3,It's OK,Just used our new Whirley pop for the first time. I should have paid attention to the other reviews on the gears. The plastic gears stick once the kernels start popping.
5,Movie lovers favorite!,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas, a popcorn and movie lover, thinking this could be a complete hit or a complete miss of a gift. I got lucky and it's a complete HIT! We've had to replace it because it's gotten SO much use! Popcorn comes out perfectly. Yum!!!"
2,cheap plastic gears,"We love this style of popper and it is the only style popper we use, but this particular model is somewhat cheaply made. The plastic gears do not keep cranking as the popper gets full, and the lid does not stay on tight, so that when you dump popcorn, you frequently lose the lid and your yet unpopped kernels land in the bowl as well. The price was right but this feels a bit like ""you get what you pay for"". Next time we will purchase a more expensive model with metal gears and heavier metal."
2,thin very thin,"the stirring mechanism works as stated but I had to put a pad below it to even out hot spots. Given a second chance, i would look for a better pan"
1,Keeps on breaking,"I love the Whirley -Pop, but I have the worst luck with the gear mechanism breaking. My third Whiley-Pop broke after just three days of use. I have tried repairing it myself with out much luck. The warranty does not work well because its just a little more money to buy a new one. I have given up on Whirley-Pops and now use a Cusinart Popper which works very well."
1,Disappointing,Had it for a year and it breaks. The plastic cog that drives the stirring mechanism cracked. Would I buy this again? No. Why would anyone put plastic into a product that is subject to such heat?Very disappointing indeed.
2,Whirly Pop Failure,"Mine worked fine for a few servings of popcorn, but the gears are made of plastic. They didn't last long. If they were made of metal or other durable material that would last, I would rate the product a ""buy."" For now, I can't recommend it."
2,Felknor vs Whirley-Pop,"I bought a Felknor popper about 20 years ago. It is still going strong, I passed it on to my son. I tried to find a replacement, could only find Whirley-Pop. The first two were very short lived due to the poor attactment of the gears to the shafts. Also, I could not get a response to our complaint by the manufacturer in spite of the guarantee. I finally bought a third but only because I needed a popcorn fix and I first inspected the thing in the store and found that the gears were now pinned to the shaft. I'm not happy with Whirly-Pop the company, but I am have good popcorn."
5,real popcorn,"If your idea of good popcorn is from the microwave, then you haven't tried the real thing and it isn't dry, like the airpoppers."
3,Disappointed,"Just opened the box, not even used and a knob came off the first time it was touched. We have had this popper in the past and loved it. Guess we just got the one with poor workmanship this time. Too much trouble to send back. Will try and repair it. Popper costs too much to be so flimsy."
2,Shoddy and unsafe,"I bought 2 poppers, one for myself and one for a gift. I used mine about 3 times and noticed that one of the little wooden knobs had fallen off. I searched for 10 minutes and found one sharp screw pin in my popcorn. I never found the other pin so maybe we ate it. I sent both back as I dont want my granddaughter to swallow a metal pin. I was so dissappointed since now I have to come up with another gift at the last minute."
1,Poor Construction,"I don't mind the plastic gears or the gauge of the metal. However the popper that was sent to me had a metal rod that did not reach the bottom of the pan and the clips for the lid did not have a secure fit. Because of the rod length, it will not stir the popcorn making the unit useless. I have one from many years ago that is a little beat up but it still works perfectly. I did not expect a super quality popper but I did expect one that worked."
2,lid too sharp,"Hello, Recently the lid to my popper broke and I had it for years. I took advantage of the 25 year warranty and had the lid replaced for free although I did pay shipping. Do know that the product has changed and not for the better. The metal is so sharp on the edge of the lid that I sliced my left thumb open while doing the dishes this morning, just in time for holiday cooking. The metal should not be this sharp anywhere on a piece of equipment especially for use in cooking."
5,GREAT for roasting coffee beans!,"It does take a few trials to get it ""right"". My first try gave me a burnt roast (past 2nd crack) and my 2nd one was under-roasted, but it's been smooth sailing after that. (Hint: Do the first few batches in 1/4 lb lots)Things that I recommend:1. Put in a thermometer (500F should be good), by drilling a small hole on the top. (Costs 5-15 bux)2. HIGHLY recommend putting the whirley-pop on a heavy bottom pan to evenly distribute the heat.3. An electric stove top is good enough (on medium setting, 1/2 lb at a time)Why buy a $200 roaster that will break in 2 years ? Roasting using the whirley-popper is FUNNNN..."
2,Rubbery popcorn.,"I was using a heavy pan and tilting the lid and got GREAT results. But it took about 15 minutes to make enough for our family of 4. In came the Whirley pop. It only takes about 8 minutes to get enough for all of us now, but the popcorn is rubbery. I even tried enlarging the air holes and leaving the snap lid propped up (facing away from me while popping - of course). Didn't improve the results. I also hate that the tin rubs off on my clothes if I hold it against me while wiping it out."
5,best popcorn ever,The Whirley-Pop Popcorn Popper makes the best popcorn as quick as a microwave. You control the amount of oil and or butter you use and the popcorn comes out fluffier without those hard husks. This leaves amazingly few un-popped kernals.
1,IT BROKE THE FIRST TIME USED,"I received it rather fast, which was nice. However, the first time i took it out to use it, after reading the instruction sheet/care manual, i did everything it said to do and in the middle of popping the popcorn it broke. The little plastic gear broke off and feel on the floor and the handle slide right out. I have had a whirley-pop before and it last for a long time, several years, but this one was made very cheaply and poorly. If you are looking into getting a whirley-pop I would recommend going to the store like walmart or target and actually look at them before you buy it."
2,Poorly made,"This popper makes great tasting popcorn, but the design for the gears is completely wrong. I used mine exactly as instructed and it broke within 2 months! The gear attached to the handle slips making it impossible to stir. The gears should be made of metal and welded to the handle. I should have listened to the other reviews regarding this problem. I cannot recommend this product at all."
5,I buy popcorn in 50 pound bags,I buy popcorn in 50 pound bags and have been enjoying popcorn longer than I care to admit. I am on my second Whirly-Pop and couldn't be happier with this popping machine.I just bought one for my daughter and she is thrilled. The problem cited with the plastic gears can be avoided by stopping stirring when the popper is full and stirring becomes difficult. (You don't need to stir anymore anyhow.)
4,BUY THE WHIRLEY POPPER DON'T BUY THE POPCORN,"The Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper works fine... nice alternative to Microwave and Air Pop machines. But, I strongly recommend that you do NOT purchase the packages of popcorn/oil/salt. The popping of the corn is inconsistent and the oil in some of the packets is old and solidifying."
2,Construction could be a LOT better.....,"The Whirley-Pop model we bought is different from the one shown---the gears are PLASTIC--bad idea #1--and the handle is plastic and set very close to the pot...bad idea #2.The lid stayed on for the first 2-3 uses, then just failed. It's almost impossible to handle piping-hot oil and attempt to keep the lid on. I consider it a definite hazard. The handle on our model is built so that one's hand is directly over the stove burner. Add attempts at controlling the entire contraption with oven mitts and you have a recipe for disaster. I'm too afraid to wrestle with it again--I'm afraid I'll burn myself.Which is a shame, because the popper really makes excellent popcorn. I'd buy another one if it were better-constructed and had METAL GEARS."
5,The Great Whirley Popcorn Popper,This is a great popcorn popper. It is easy to use andmakes great popcorn. The tecture and taste is much better than several other popers that I've used in the past.
2,not sturdy enough,"The plastic gears on these poppers do not grip to the metal post/crank and slip. Any resistance results in the user turning the handle but no movement within the popper. Worked great for first year of average or less use but now, pretty intermittant and a really, more pain than worth. I only continue to use it to keep oil buildup off of other pans. We shake, not crank, now. Won't buy another as it's unfortunately yet another disposable product that overloads landfills."
3,works well,"This works well, but it is very cheaply made. Extremely lightweight. I would look for a different brand if I were to buy again."
5,old time convience,This is a very good product. Have been enjoying it a bunch--hope it lasts a long time.
4,as advertised,"Makes good fluffy popcorn everytime, easy to clean, quiet and quick. One note, do not wash in dishwasher, this will ruin surface. Otherwise we like better than all airpoppers."
4,Best popcorn,"This product makes perfect tasty popcorn every time. The only drawback is that you have to stand over the stove the entire time, unlike microwave popcorn makers. However, it only takes a couple of minutes."
1,Absolutely terrible!,"I purchased this, based on all the wonderful reviews. I'm wondering if people typed their reviews under the wrong product!!!It took forever for the corn to start popping. I didn't think I was ever going to get done stirring.It did finally start popping and once the pan starts filling up with popcorn it is very hard to stir; impossible at the end. I took it off the stove so the popcorn wouldn't burn because I couldn't stir it.The next day, I didn't realize my husband had wiped it out so I took the cover off; then discovered that the lid itself was thick with butter residue.It did make pretty decent popcorn, but I DON'T LIKE IT and won't be using it. I still can't imagine that people actually gave it the glowing reviews I've read. Right now, I wouldn't take one if someone gave it to me."
1,Waste of money,"Don't purchase this item. I had a similar item from a different manufacturer, I loved the old one and had used at least once a week for over ten years but it was getting old and I wanted a new one and ordered this item. The wooden knob fell off the first time I used it. By the fourth time I used it, the center plastic gear popped up and the gears wouldn't engage anymore. I thought I'd fixed it, but it sprung again the next very next time and the entire lid began to warp. Recap: I owed it for less than two months, it made about 5 loads of popcorn and now the ""Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper"" is in the garbage. I truly could not be more disappointed."
5,Can't be beat,I have owned this for well over 10 years. The gears are finally getting worn but I have a feeling it was because I did a no-no and have been occasionally been putting the lid in the dishwasher. Overall this is a fantastic product. Hardly ever any unpopped kernals remain in the pan. No complaints at all. Have bought them for gifts. Don't be afraid to try it!
5,Best Popcorn!,"Whiley Pop has been my favorite for many years. I'm on my second one, the first one lasted for many years. Put a little veggie oil on the bottom of the pan, a cup of popcorn and perfect popcorn every time. Say goodbye to oily, flavored microwave popcorn! Yum"
1,do not buy this popper,It is made of aluminum and plastic. Buy the Back to basic popper. It has metal gears and is made of stainless steel.
3,great popcorn...but plastic gears break,once our plastic gears broke the popcorn didn't turn. it should be made of metal. it does make great popcorn though. ours lasted a couple years.
4,popcorn poper,"The kids love this, I enjoy not having to pop so many bags, and being able to watch how much butter and salt."
3,Easier to just use a pot,"I was really excited to get this product and while it does what it says it's supposed to do, you can get the same results with just using a pot with a lid. I also thought this product was going to be made better but the stirring mechanism inside is only a couple of thick wires. It does pop every single kernel but using a pot on the stove does that almost just as well and a pot is much easier to clean. Because of the all the parts to clean, I've only used this popper once and I continue to just make my popcorn in a pot instead. Save your money!"
5,Best Popper You Can Buy,"Oddly enough, I bought mine at a garage sale for $1!Anyway, I wanted to get more whole grains in my diet, and popcorn is a whole grain (that actually tastes good).This thing ain't brain surgery.-Don't wash in the dishwasher, do it by hand and don't wash the wood, and don't wash it all the time, if you use it a lot, only wash it about every 1-2 weeks.-Use decent popcorn, and not old stuff, bottom line, it's not the corn.-Canola, olive, vegetable oil are all good, 1 or 2 tablespoonsPersonally, I got a salad oil bottle because I hate pouring it over and over since I make so much popcorn-Medium heat with the oil and 2 or 3 kernels. Once they pop, dump in right around 1/2 cup of popcorn (measure it!) If you just guess, you'll blow the top, which is fun, but messy-Steady turning while it's warming, in about 2-3 minutes yer all done.Eat. Yum. Awesome."
5,Great Popcorn Popper,"This was everything the reviews said it was. Pops perfectly and quickly, easy clean up, great tasting popcorn. I loved mine so much, I bought another for my parents. I am not rough on mine, but do see the gears are plastic, so I'm careful with it but I'm realistic that it may not last forever. Rest assured, I'll be buying another if it does. Had I known about this popcorn maker before, I would have bought it years ago! My parents had an air popper years ago but this trumps that gadget hands down. The only downside I see at the present time is that I eat twice as much popcorn now!"
5,Perfect Popper!,Product is lightweight and easy to clean. Fitted lid keeps all oil and kernels contained during cooking. Batch pops full and crisp! Truly an excellent design!
1,DO NOT BUY Gears break after only a few uses,Another crap product with an Achilles heel. The gears are plastic and not heat tolerant so they break and then your popper is worthless. They'll sell you a new lid with the same gear so you can experience the failure again if you like. This product is a piece of s***
1,This is CRAP,"Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn PopperI have been using this popcorn popper for years. I bought a new one after mine was falling apart after many years of use. The new one is made of FOIL. Believe me when I tell you that a flip top can has more tin than this popper. The gears are now made of plastic. Any resistance and it will break. The gear popped off the first use because there was a small amount of resistance stirring the popped corn. Even the instructions tell you not to get this pot too hot because the metal will melt. That should tell you something. Spend more money and get a REAL ""all metal"" popper. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Poor qualtiy,"I bought this for a gift for Christmas last year and the popper never worked properly - the gear on top didn't turn the stirring rod inside the popper. I wouldn't recommend this popper. I own another popper made by a different company and after 5 or 6 years of use, it still works well."
2,Plastic gears,"After a couple of uses, the aluminum rod separates from the plastic gear that turns the stirrer. This is understandable because plastic will deform after a period of time, particularly if it's under stress.This looks like an engineering flaw. Metallic gears would have been better.And I agree with the other users that complained about the ease of burning your popcorn, particularly if the plastic gear disengages and falls off while you're popping popcorn."
5,Best Popper!!!,"We *LOVE* this popcorn popper! We tried different models as we switched from the very unhealthy microwave popcorn. This was the best by far, we keep it on the stove and have used it at least 100 times.Pros:-makes perfect, yummy popcorn-fun for kids (not toddlers)-can pop with just one tablespoon of oil, super healthy and tastes great with just a little salt (all other models needed more oil and butter)-attractive enough to leave on stove-quality design-super easy to clean (if used frequently enough, all you need is a paper towel)-quick and easy to useCons:-you must stir the handle continuously for the 3-5 minutes it takes to pop (no biggie for us- my elementary aged kids love turning the handle anyway and have to take turns)"
5,An American Classic,"This thing makes EXCELLENT popcorn pretty quickly and very easily. It's cheap, using plain kernels, and very customizable...you can experiment with different recipes.Cleanup is easy, and just requires being wiped out with a paper towel.I haven't had problems with mine, but I know that Wabash Valley has great customer service and will replace parts in the event of a mechanical problem.Highly recommended!"
3,Nice but Bad,Works great but the crank handle is pretty cheap. Handle must be made so one has to keep reordering it.
5,The best popcorn I have had,"Deceptively simple design,which appears antiquated. It is not.The hand crank allows allo of the popcorn kernels to beturned etc.,allowing for more kernels popped. The smell is wonderful, the taste is more like popcorn, less like cardboard. The popper comes apart in 2 pieces, is easy to clean, simple to use{pour in 1-3 tbsp of oil, 1/2 cup popcorn, stir for 3 minutes, and voila`}.If all things worked as well and simply as this..."
5,I saw kettle corn sold for 7.50 the other day,I saw kettle corn sold for 7.50 a bag last week while I was out of town.(About a batch from the whirly pop) I make it at home for pennies. I love my whirly pop. Actually mine is the Theater II which is the whirly pops previuos name.We use 2/3 cup of popcorn to2 tbsp of oilafter the oil boils I add 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tsp salt.Keep turning until the popping slows and dump it into a bowl!It is so good.It beats the heck out of standing in front of the stove shaking a pan back and forth over a hot stove.
4,Godd Product,"For some reason, this popcorn popper popps most all of the kernals, much more than our normal cooking pot. If you put too much popcorn in the popper at once, they fill the kettle and then the handle is very hard to turn. After pouring out some of the popped corn, some kernals on the bottem may get burnt. Other than my misuse, this is a pretty good way to pop a small batch of popcorn. Good product."
3,not as good as the back to basics model,"The paddle inside does not touch the bottom, so it cannot stir the popcorn until it starts popping."
5,Whirley-Pop,"This makes the absolute best popcorn. Goodbye microwave, hello fresh, crunchy, flavorful popcorn. Doesn't take any longer than using the microwave. You just have to stay on it more. My only suggestion is that they upgrade their small ""starter"" sample of popcorn in their purchase. The popcorn is pretty low grade stuff. They should include only top shelf quality to get you hooked on. Otherwise, a perfect gismo. Highly recommend."
4,Great pop corn popper,"I've had my Whirly Pop popcorn popper for more than 8 years and it still works great.In the 1970's my first job in high school was as an usher at the biggest theater in the area. We popped all our own popcorn and I did more than my share, so I know about popcorn. This is the closest I've come to making theater corn on the stove. The real trick is the oil. You have to use flavored theater oil that is hard like shortening before it's heated. The liquid kind is OK, but any other oil just doesn't quite do it.The only issue I have is that it's a little difficult to clean and the oil can get caked on the mixing arm.I'm giving them out to friends as Christmas gifts this year."
2,WhirlyPop popper is kinda cheezy,"Inexpensive, but IMO pretty poorly constructed. The idea is good (pop all the kernels --- and it does that) but it is poorly put together with barely marginal parts that slip and so ultimately we just tossed it and went back to the old pot. Cannot recommend to buy."
3,Works great but super-cheap construction,"I agree with the guy that gave this a 1-star review in that it is cheaply constructed. I gave it 3 stars because when it is not broken it makes good popcorn super fast and easy!Mine, too, failed around the plastic gear mechanism. There is a 25 year warranty on moving parts so we'll see how that goes trying to return it for repair. (UPDATE. They sent me a new lid but I had to pay for shipping and handling which I'm sure more than paid for the lid. I probably should have just bought a new one for all the trouble I went through. The new lid has a different design which includes set screw to hold the gears in place so they obviously new its design was defective)Also, the tabs that hold the lid on are not steel, they are aluminum, so they bend. Be careful with them and you won't have a problem."
5,Excellent corn popper,The product is well made and very easy to use. Produces excellent popcorn! Has replaced our use of microwave popcorn!
2,tough,"It is fun to work, but I think it ruins the texture of the popcorn, makes it tough, instead of light and fluffy the way popcorn should be."
2,If you like cheaply made products - you will love this...,"Although this works OK so far - every time I use it the bottom warps & has to be beat back flat with a wooden block. If you don't, the crank turns hard, as the stirrers rub the pan bottom. I feel the gear problem I see mentioned so often is tied to this defect. The metal is paper thin. I have ordered a different stove top popper with a stainless steel pan. Hopefully it will be better quality. Whirley-Pop had good quality at one time, but they don't now. What can they be thinking, flushing their good reputation away? I don't expect any longevity from this item. :O("
3,FUn nostalgia trip,So first off- there is no definitive link between Aluminum and any diseases- if there were would we still have aluminum cans for our soda? Now onto the popping! This is a good popper- only problem you do not want to overfill it- too much corn and the stirrer gets stuck and then you get burned kernels on the bottom.I make up my olive oil and garlic salt and pepper popcorn in this and it tastes great! Do be careful with the lid- if you are not you can bend the hinges and break it- like my roommate did so I am back to using my 6 quart pot with a glass lid.
2,Popper not what they used to be!,"I have owned a similar style popper for many years, and I loved it, but it finally wore out and broke. The replacement that I bought a month ago is much lighter duty, does not stir the corn well, and tends to burn the corn quickly if you are not extremely careful. The price was high for such a piece of junk."
5,I'm impressed!,"I've been making popcorn at home for years using a normal pot and have been improving my process all the time. But my first use of the Whirley-Pop popper produced the best popcorn I made at home ever; and I was using the same corn and oil I usually use.It was extremely easy to use, just add oil, kernels, stick on the fire and turn the knob.Highly recommended!"
5,Popcorn Popper,I bought this product for my Mom who wanted an old fashioned popcorn popper. I talked with her yesterday & she said the popcorn tasted just like what she ate as a young girl. The popper makes great popcorn every time.
4,excellent,practical for domestic uses. but can be a small time commercial use at the same time.especially for those countries with high electricity bill.
4,Kitchen,"It pops really well, but the part that stirs the corn when the crank is turned can scrape the bottom of the pan and get stuck. I had to bend the two ""whirly"" stirrers up."
4,Great Popcorn Maker,"Love this popcorn maker. Pops almost all of the kernels.Small problem where the twirler meshes with the handle -- but we fixed that.Now eat popcorn 5 out of 7 nights! It NEVER gets put away, but has earned a permanent spot near the stove."
5,Best Christmas gift ever!,"I've heard wonderful things about this machine but, as a natural skeptic, I figured much of the hype was unwarranted. However, with Christmas day quickly approaching and my pocketbook getting a bit thin, I decided to take a chance on the Whirley-Pop Popcorn Popper as a gift for granny. In a word... fantastic! It's not often that I offer praise for consumer products, but this one deserves every accolade I can heap upon it... and then some. This is by far the best popcorn I've ever tasted from the kitchen. It really tastes (and smells) just like the expensive stuff cranked out at the concession stand in theaters. Absolutely delicious. Oh, and granny loves it too, which is great, since this was supposed to be her Christmas gift in the first place. Highly recommended! 5 stars!"
5,Best popcorn ever!,"The Whirley Pop makes the best popcorn ever. It is fast, easy and fun to use. Clean-up is a breeze. I use it all the time."
3,Warning! Aluminum!!!,"I received one of these as a gift. I use it for roasting coffee and it is fabulous! However, none of us should be cooking with aluminum due to the risks of pathologies that can come later in life. I think this is of particular concern from a device that has moving components inside that effectively scrape material into the food within. I am going to purchase a stainless steel version of this device. There are several out there, and while they are double or more in price, they are worth it to me."
2,"Fun, but I was disappointed","Ours burned the first time we ever used it -- and we followed the directions to a ""t""; didn't use high heat. And once this thing gets burned it is almost impossible to ever use it again. Oh, well."
2,Made Cheaply,"I have used the popper for 5 years..I am on my 3rd one, or should I say I am throwing out my 3rd one ! The plastic gear which enables the handle to turn melts like a 2 cents Made In China piece of junk ..Also, their popcorn has a very limited shelf life and goes stale in no time..The product used to be better..."
2,Gear mechanism broke after about 5 uses.,"This popper made terrific tasting popcorn, but the turning gearmechanism on the top of the pan is made of plastic, and broke afterI used the pan about 5 times. The pan heats up very hot, and theplatic is a poor choice to use in the turning mechanism.They should of used metal."
5,Whirley Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper,"I bought this popper to replace the one I had worn out. It is great! It brings back memories of when I used to pop corn on the old coal stove, in Kentucky--years ago! There is nothing like homemade popcorn and the Whirley-Pop serves the purpose really well. I pop my corn in olive oil (extra light) and add the buttery seasoning when I add the oil. It is so much better than the microwave popcorn. When I wear this one out, I will buy another one. They have me hooked for life on this product. Thank you so very much."
1,Poorly constructed,"After trying kettle corn at a fair, I was interested in making something similar at home. Unfortunately, this popcorn maker is not the choice. The popper is made of thin material and the small stirrer inside the popper rubs the bottom of the pot resulting in a poorly popped corn and a very scratched bottom."
1,"Worked fine for a few times, then broke and caught fire!!!","When my wife and I first bought this popcorn maker, it seemed terrific -- made it easier to make popcorn, although it was a bit of a pain to clean. But yesterday, my wife used it and noticed that something was wrong with the first batch of popcorn. When she tried another batch, the oil inside CAUGHT FIRE!! Apparently, the plastic on the lid had deformed and started to melt.Needless to say, we won't be buying this popper again."
2,well conceived but poorly executed,Works for a very short while. Pan is too thin so bottom is easily dented which makes the stirring not work. Stir crazy is much better and stirs itself. Pan bottom is paper thin. Can be dented with finger pressure. Popped corn is difficult to get out of pan as it sticks due to shape of pan forcing corn too tightly interwoven. Stirring mechanism feels cheap and weak and often gets stuck while stirring. Don't know why this thing is rated so high.
3,Love it.,"I love it. I use it weekly and the popcorn is wonderful. However, when I went to register it the Whirley-Pop site did not accept the SN. I called them and left a message. I never got a return call."
4,So much better than microwave popcorn,"The Whirlypop makes the best home made popcorn. I would have given it 5 stars, but I don't like washing it!"
4,I love the Whirley Pop,"I've had this popcorn popper for 15 or more years. The stovetop crank is what makes it the best popcorn popper I've ever used. I use organic popcorn (stored in the freezer) and not a lot of oil. I like it so much that I have now given eight of them to friends and family who genuinely love a fabulous bowl of popcorn. Unlike microwave popcorn, I can control the amount of oil and salt. And it tastes a whole lot better."
5,Great popcorn!,"I recommend using Olive Oil and the smaller, white kernals. I add sugar once they start popping and it makes fantastic kettle corn."
5,fast and easy,"Since getting this, Just a tablespoon of oil and a bit of salt, my family has become popcorn junkies. In a matter of minutes, hot corn!!!! I have taken all the microwave corn to the office to get rid of it."
5,Only Popcorn Popper to Get!,This is a great popper! My family has had one for many years and now I have one of my own.
5,Fun for the whole family,"I have had my entire family over some time or another, and made popcorn with the whirly pop. Parents, nieces, newphews, my own young boys, and husband love making popcorn. Our faves are cinnamon and kettle corn. It's great for gifts and movie nights. Very easy to use. I bought one for a White Elephant gift excahnge, it went around the room again and again. Soooo much fun."
4,Great popcorn!,"The Whirley-Pop makes great popcorn! I received this as a gift after hearing about it from others. I used to make popcorn on the stovetop in a large saucepan...overtime I ruined the pan using such high heat on it. This popper does require standing at the stove for 3 minutes and cranking the handle, but you need very little oil and it pops EVERY kernel without burning them! The cleaning of the pot is very easy. The lid of the popper does collect oil/grease in the air holes which is harder to clean but even if left a little greasy, it doesn't effect the popping."
5,perfect popper,This is a great popper! A friend of mine introduced me to this handy little contraption and once my stir crazy quit and just burned the kernals - I ordered this baby. Perfect popping - almost no kernals (non-pops) left in pan. Amazing and quick!
5,Best popcorn for home,"I love theater popcorn, but I have never been thrilled with any microwave variety. I asked for this for Christmas, and now we make popcorn constantly. It is super fast and easy to make a HUGE bowl of popcorn. Cleanup consists of wiping it down with a paper towel. I have only tried the pre-measured packets of Wabash popcorn that are made for the Whirley Pop, but I don't know why i would want to try anything else. It is like having my own theater at home now. This inexpensive popper is well worth it."
5,Love that popcorn!,The Wabash Valley Farms Popcorn Popper makes the very best home style popcorn ever! Easy to use & clean. No more extra microwave popcorn calories! And a super money saver on popcorn kernels instead of microwavable bags.
5,The best popcorn popper! Perfect popcorn every time,"We have had this product for 5 years now, and popcorn is failproof and delicious. Friends all love ours so much, that we bought the Whirley Pop for them as gifts for Christmas. They said it is the best gift they received!"
5,Great Popcorn,"I've had my popper for several years. It makes great popcorn every time. It cleans up easily and has stood up to some heavy use by my teenage sons. My only caution would be that the pan and lid get hot, so take care not to burn your fingers in your hurry to get to the popcorn"
2,Whirley Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper,This product while still making good popcorn has been made much cheaper than the older models. The material that the top and the clamps that hold it on to the kettle are so thin and weak that it barely stays attached when dumping the popcorn. I had an older version that was far superior manufacture to the present model. I would rather pay more for a better made item than what is being made now.
3,Great while it lasted!,"I bought this 3-4 months ago and have been using it at least once per week.The plastic gears broke apart last week. With no crank assembly, this is just a big, paper-thin pan.How much more would it have cost them to make it with solid metal gears? This wasn't a cheap pan, but certainly made with cheap parts."
1,Cheap and defective,"The particular popcorn popper that we received was defective. We tested it without any popcorn in it by just turning the handle. Not only did the device not work, but the plastic teeth started breaking off with very little pressure applied. We are in the process of returning it and will look elsewhere for a popcorn popper."
1,Thin tin pan,"I didn't use the popper because I knew right away that I was going to return it because (1) the metal was too lightweight and I figured it would burn easily and (2) the turning mechanism wasn't moving smoothly--maybe when the oil is added it would work properly, but I didn't want to chance experimenting with it."
3,"It's OK, but...","We got a Whirley Pop stovepop popper for Christmas 3 years ago, and it makes pretty good corn. My only complaint is about the quality of the gear on the top of the popper, it is made of a plastic material and has gotten so worn down that cranking the handle does not engage the gear and it won't turn any more. Still makes decent corn, though."
3,Flimsy construction,"This popper does make very good popcorn--as long as it lasts. The little gears which drive the wire stirring rod very quickly start to slip on the stirring handle. It is truly a shame because for the short time it works, it truly makes good popcorn. I've had three of these things and, to be fair, the first one did last a good long while; the other two very quickly failed."
3,"Nice idea, but poor quality","We have used and purchased these as gifts. Under only moderate use, the plastic gears wear out and the entire popcorn popper rendered useless. Needs to have quality gears and I'd give it 5 stars. Disappointed enough that I will not buy another one."
2,Lasted < 6 mos... then broke,"Hi. I used this popper about 6 times since i bought it and it broke last night. When you look at how it's constructed, it's not hard to see why it is broken. The construction is really cheap and feels flimsy. The screw that keeps the top part connected to the 'whirley' part snapped off and now it needs to be trashed."
5,Best popper I've had and this is my third,"Before you think this is too cheap and won't last because this was my third one, I should say that each of the others survived at least 2 household moves and 3 to 4 years of use by a serious popcorn hound! My husband snacks on popcorn while watching football, movies and other times and probably makes popcorn at least once a week on average (sometimes twice on a Saturday). The only problem we've had is after a few years of use the plastic gear at the end of the crank handle came off the previous one and the whole crankshaft came apart. Still, can't complain after using a few years. My first one got dented during moves but still worked 3 or 4 years. Great little popper, but I wish I could find the larger capacity (> 6qt). Have recommended to all my friends."
5,Great popper!,This pot is so straight forward and so easy. Highly recommend it. Way quieter and easier than shaking a pot back and forth over the burner. Makes tasty popcorn!
4,Makes pretty good popcorn,"Low-tech, stove-top (mine is gas) popcorn popper. It's really nice to be able to use VERY little oil--1 tsp of canola for a single serving. Almost 100% kernel-popping success. The unit seems a little flimsy. We'll see how it holds up. Popped corn tastes better and is much healthier than the microwaved, chemical-laden stuff."
1,Awful,"I was looking for a catering book at my local book store & this was the only one they had. I paged through it & it was terrible. I agree with the other reviewer that this was a very basic book. I was looking for more information on the requirement of having a commercial kitchen in California. While I didn't necessarily expect to find specific state information, all the book said was you may be required to get a commercial kitchen. No resources on *where* I would find that information or who I would contact. And when I looked at the business card section, all it said was to get business cards & stationary with your business logo - duh. It sounded to me like this was a book written by someone who might have general business start up experience, but no catering business experience. It was very generic."
1,The authors should be embarrassed.,"This is the worst ""how-to"" book I have ever read. To criticize it, I wouldn't even know where to start except to say that it's useless. All of the ""information"" is either terribly inane and/or known to everyone over the age of ten, or is completely irrelevent. For instance, it's discuss whether you should get money from Venture Capitalists for a catering business(!) and then ten pages are spent informing you about the computer you'll need, including a little bit about keyboards and monitors!I want my money back."
4,Terrific Info for Someone Just Getting Started!!,"I've been well pleased with the content of this book. Very thoroughly thought through, and written in an easy to understand way. Very practical in its approach. I'm very glad I bought it."
1,no new material,"this book does not cover any new material learned in even a BAD high school trigonometry course and ninth grade algebra other than polar cooridinates and parametric equations. do not use this above the high school level. there is ALOT of stuff you already know. don't use this book even for a review unless you dont know ninth grade math. the topics of functions are so obvious, yet he covers them over about 7 chapters."
2,not good,"I used this item to cut my grandson's hair, but he scared because it was too noisy when motor is running. I emailed seller to request the authorization return but they didn't reply me. First I don't trust any seller except Amazon.com that why I ordered it thru Amazon.com. I think this seller is worst among many sellers I have been bussiness with. I rate this product is not good to buy and seller is not reliable."
5,Big fans!,I received the CD and LOVE IT!! Great mixes!! I've played it for my minister of music and youth pastor. We are all big fans!!
4,"Compelling, Fact-filled","By exploring a variety of information in a short and intriguing manner, this book does very well. If you are an enthusiast of historical information concerning photography, the Bowery, the circus, or disfiguring diseases you will enjoy adding this one to your collection. It does not encompass a large wealth of knowledge on any one of these subjects, nor does it show a great deal of varied photographs however, taking into consideration the variety of information covered, it works. It does leave you wanting more.I was disappointed to not have a greater variety of photographic subjects as told were included in the original collection. I did however enjoy completing the book in one sitting, as the information was quite compelling. It left me with a thirst for more and a general knowledge of the people involved, the photographer, and the times."
4,A Lighter Blue,"It doesn't have the most stay power of Special Effect colors, but was definitely a good light-ish blue. After about 2 months it had completely faded out though (which may have been due to my hair being damaged from all the bleachings it's seen.)"
3,Don't love this color,"I have previously used another color from Special Effects and I really loved it. This particular one though isn't so great. The color wasn't as bright as I was hoping (and I bleached well) and it faded very quickly. The fading color is pretty ugly, it is a sort of bluish grey."
3,Not their best color,"SFX has better colors than this one. It's a pretty purple blue, but came out a little lighter than I wanted for the blue I was looking for. It faded quickly & it does stain your tub / sink if you don't get it off immediately! I love all the other SFX colors I have tried."
3,Tended to be too boring,"This is the 2nd book about Native American lives - the other being the Navajo - and this one is like the other one. BORING. I found that this was just a listing of all these obscure facts and minor happenings. I guess what I expect to read when I pick up a book on the Utes is what was their life like? What did they eat? How did they hunt? What was their life really like? This book just dragged on and on about so many little details that I wound up just skimming through half of it looking for something different and interesting. Can't someone write a good book about one of the tribes? I've heard of 1 or 2 others I am going to check out. Hopefully, they will be more exciting and educational."
5,COMPLETE HOME STYLE BOOK,THE BEST HOME DESIGN AND DECORATE BOOK . IT CONTAINS INFORMATIONS AND GUIDE LINES ASTO ALL THE CURRENT NEW DESIGNERS.
2,too hard to follow,"The instuctions were simply too complicated and hard to follow, you really NEED an instructor to do this kind of exercise, which explains why about 1/2 the book is a list of studios and teachers. I did not find this book helpful, I am very sorry to say."
2,yuck--a money maker but does it even make them any money?,"Difficult to follow, in some ways contrived, too neatly packaged and some of the photos are wrong and/or the models have horrible posture themselves. I wish I had the book on me to cite one. I have learned more about ""standing pilates"" from other sources and some of it is intriguing but all in all a little much, especially for the average pilates-class participant for whom the original mat work is challenging enough. It seems to be nothing but a catchy money maker but, then again, I can't see how they should make money on this one! Kind of sad, but also kind of irresponsible."
5,Pink Hoodie Cashmere,I gave it as a gift and bought myself a lesser grade of cashmere. When you see me and my girl friend together in our pink cashmere hoodies the difference is very obvious. I wish I had bought this one for myself also. It is beautiful. Judy
5,The best work of American fiction from the AIDS pandemic,"Put simply, Barnett's ""The Body and Its Dangers"" is the best work of American fiction to come out of the AIDS pandemic--its beautiful prose, its rich and fierce vision. The long story ""The 'Times' As It Knows Us"" alludes to and is finally equal to Joyce's ""The Dead"": it's a story as large as the complexities and sorrows it describes."
3,Poor design,"Although the lens adapter accommodates the 58mm lens series, it partially blocks the viewfinder view and the flash causing an unacceptable photo. Clearly an Canon caused problem."
3,Fast Shipping but Wrong Product,"I have never received a product in such a timely manner, however it was too good to be true. They sent me the wrong product. I have a Canon Powershot G2 and I order the LA-DC58 adapter, however the sent me the LA-DC58B adapter which is for the Canon Powershot G3 camera. If they would have sent me the correct item or the correct replacement then I would have definitely purchased from them again. Hopefully, I will get a email back with some good news."
4,An Academic critique of an American icon,"This is one of the only books I've ever read that critique General Patton. This book, to me the layman seems extremely well researched, and worthy of academic exaltations. The author is brave to look at the Lorraine Campaign with such a critical eye, not always welcome on American icons of war."
5,Personal Reasons,"My dad was in the 95th Infantry Division. And fought in the Lorraine Camp,. I had a few pictures of my dad in Europe. He told me a little about the Battle for Metz. Really great book. THANKS"
1,Really BAD Writing.,Corny and boring. I couldn't finish it. I tried several times. I didn't like these characters and I've read this plot several times before
4,Cathie Pelletier rocks,"Loved this book, being of the Woodstock generation myself. I appreciated the intergenerational slant of this book and plan to read it again.Bound to stand the test of time."
3,Enjoyable summer read,"I enjoyed this book. Parts of it are very funny, but it also has a serious side. The lesson learned by the main character was something all people can relate to. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about real people and real life (and also enjoy a little comedy!)."
4,Woodstock notions,"As I mentioned in my review of Pelletier's sixth novel, BEAMING SONNY HOME (Crown Publishers, 1996) , having read one of the author's books I was left hungry for more. No dissapointment here. This is a tale of two forty-somethings who first met in the mud of the epochal music fest and foundered in the ruts of yuppiedom. Pelletier's fifth novel is darn near as good as her sixth. BEAMING is a bit more subtlely wrought while WOODSTOCK is a little funnier, but both work well. Some of the author's observations about my Woodstock generation cut close enough to hurt, and many made me laugh at myself. Out loud. I am left curious about her fourth novel and anxious to find her seventh. Huzzah!"
5,amazing! a rare gem to be discovered,"If you like roots reggae, this album should be at the top of your list. It's the perfect blend of the old-school authentic 70's reggae sound with an African twist. Reminds me of the Wailers, Midnite, Burning Spear.Buy it up and simmer down to some sweet positive and uplifting music."
4,Thriller.,"Sure,the title doesn't make it sound like a scary book,but it is.Jessica dates another boy while her boyfriends away.When her boyfriend(AJ)returns,she tells Christopher it's over,not yet realizing he is a psychopath.Find out if he manages to drive the two of them into a brick wall."
5,"""Has Jessica found someone new?"" (SVH #54)","While Jessica Wakefield's steady boyfriend, A. J. Morgan, is out of state for the weekend, she falls for Christopher, a surfer she meets at the beach (she doesn't even know his last name), hence the title of this book: ""Two-Boy Weekend."" Part of Jessica wants to be faithful to A. J. (uh-huh, riiight); but another part of Jess wants to revert to her old self, the one who likes to date a new guy every week. But then Christopher starts stalking her, and Jess is afraid A. J. will find out. Ah, typical Jess: never thinking about the consequences. I was never a big Jessica fan (I preferred Liz instead, who, at the end of this book, is in danger of being kidnapped--deja vu from book #13, ""Kidnapped!""--because of her sister), but fans of this wayward twin should love her two-boy weekend fiasco. As for any subplots--which is typical in a SVH book that can't stretch its main plot to 150 pages or so--there aren't any; it's all about Jess and her boy-juggling drama."
1,Everlast Basic Bag Gloves,these gloves are better than hitting the heavybag with nothing on your hands but if you are getting serious into boxing/boxing workouts you should spend a little more and get some nice bag gloves. although everlast is a very good boxing brand my pair of these showed little wear and tear recently after i bought them. maybe its just my viscious strikes. LOL
4,"The Boston Phoenix says ""Buckfunk 3000 messes it up""","... ""First Class Ticket to Telos"" is a prolific redefining of some of techno's happier moments over the last eight years. It understands that good funk is about having fun making a mess of the music."
3,not his best work,im a huge dubee fan and this is definetly not his best work. dangerous prospects was alot better. if you like dubee i would also recomened mac dre.
4,Did not work with my Motorola phone,"Ever since I lost my charger for my Motorola phone, I've been using USB cables to recharge it.I have one cable from Belkin that works fine but others I have tried generate the ""unauthorized charger"" message and either won't recharge the phone or recharge it very slowly.I thought that since this cable said it worked for Motorola RAZR phones, it would work with my non-RAZR phone, but it didn't.Hopefully, this info will save others some money. Note to self - when the cost of an item is loaded entirely in the shipping charge - you won't be able to return the item!This USB cable works fine for other uses but the plastic has a strong smell."
1,This book is NOT as other reviewers will lead you to believe.,"Forty pages? Technically, yes, honestly? Several cheap photos of the guitarist ala 1970 Cheetos commercial fill out the pages. Not helpful photos of left and right hand positions, just silly shots. The few photos that are intended to illustrate are not clear. For example the before and after of how to hold a pick is ridiculous. A before shot? Really? The actual shot that would be useful has the camera in the wrong position.There is no music instruction here.No songs.Only power chords, which are not even technically chords.What the kid is supposed to come away with is vague.Give some rhythms, some chord changes, some actual chords, if not actual songs. Save your money. What is of use here in forty pages is covered in a page or three in many other texts. Don't be seduced by the cover. This book is not rock and roll."
3,It was okay...,"I expected more from this, but I didn't really read much into it. I got it for my nephew for Christmas. When it arrived, I looked through it and found it was over-simplified and very short."
2,skip it,"Although the book was not bad, I don't think it was what it claimed to be. Overall, the book stays with very simple notes a kid could play. Not much variety though. Maybe ok for kids <12 years old."
4,"INCORRECT POSTING TO KINDLE, THE GATES OF HEAVEN, CURT BENJAMIN","AGAIN WHOEVER POSTS ITEMS ON AMAZON PAGES, PAYS LITTLE ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY ARE PAID TO DO. THEY HAVE LISTED ON THE KINDLE THIS VOLUME AS VOLUME 2 AND IT IS VOLUME 3 AS LISTED ON OTHER SITES AND ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER."
1,Terrible Machine,"This answering machine drops calls, cuts messages off in the middle of a sentence, and will not for some reason keeps losing the proper time and date. Do not buy, not worth the money or the hassel."
1,Unreliable.,Easily the worst answering machine we've ever had. Drops messages and cuts off callers. I would not recommend this product or buy another GE answering machine.
1,don't bother,"This machine is a peice of junk. I got it set up but it would not record an incoming message at all, and the really bad thing is that the person who's calling get's the generic greeting and they leave a message thinking that it's working. Also, it would not record a personalized greeting. And the worst part? When I called general electric they pretty much told me too bad, and that because I bought it through an auction house that they don't even honor their warranty!!! I contacted Amazon and they told me how to write to the third party distributor through Amazon's website and they were great about the refund and Amazon was very helpful as well."
1,Can not recommend,"Bought this 6 mo ago. Now it will not record incomming messages and not because of the ""on/off"" button. Never could increase incomming call message length to more than 4 min - cut off a lot of call mid-message. Difficult to understand the digital language."
2,Not really worth it.,"This was a gift--a nice thought, but... ease of set-up gets five stars but that's it. Voice quality on the playback is terrible! Skips, drops info... ""Hi, this is ..san. Dinner tonight at ..other's, at ..:30."" huh? Time for a better quality unit."
3,Average Quality,"We've had this little machine for several years and it gets the job done more or less. The most irksome negative feature that it sometimes drops calls as others have mentioned. Specifically it seems if someone is a ""low talker"" or hesitates for too long when leaving a message, the machine decides their time is up and cuts off. This can create some awkward situations, especially when the call back number is cut off. Also, the setting for the time and date never seems to ""take"" no matter how often I set it. So it just announces bizarre and rather unlikely times/dates for messages - I gave up on that feature. It's a small quibble but as has been mentioned, the on/off button and the erase button are one and the same - you have to hold down the button longer to erase."
2,You get what you pay for (if not less),"I purchased this answering machine for my parents a little under a year ago. It worked fine at first. Decent quality. Might have to replay the message once or twice, but overall not too bad. Then starting a couple of weeks ago, it would get quiet during a message, then loud again, then quiet. Sometimes it would just cut off in the middle of the message. Other times, it wouldn't record. I'm sure we've had some very important messages that we missed out on because of this hunk of junk. Two stars because it started out fine. Do NOT purchase this product. It was a budget-driven mistake I won't be making with GE again."
4,Works fine for what I need...,"This machine works fine for what I need. The sound quality isn't HD or anything, but it works well for my home!"
2,Bad Answering Machine - Cuts Off Messages,"My mother has had this GE machine for a few years, and it gradually began to cut off messages. I thought I would try a new one, hoping for the best. Well, it recorded many messages well, but in a short while I received a cut-off message. I was very disappointed because other than that problem, it is good. This GE answering machine has good sound quality - a better, more natural-sounding recording of voices than the current AT&T model. Why the manufacturers can't get everything right in one product is beyond my comprehension, and causes me to feel some frustration."
3,Needs more testing,"I've had no problems receiving clear messages, its my recorded greeting that is so faint, you can hardly hear it. I'm going to have other people call from their area to see if this is the machine itself. If it is, I'll have a bone to pick with GE."
4,"Good Price, Good Function","The machine was simple to set up, and works flawlessly. I haven't tried the remote access function, but everything else works great. Sound quality isn't amazing, but I've never had trouble understanding a message. For the cost of 4 months of voicemail service, it is absolutely worth it."
1,One small problem.,This product has one small problem. It drops some messages. If you're using this product throw it away since you're probably missing messages. If you're looking for an answering machine stay away from this item.
1,GE Digital Telephone Answerer,"Setup was very easy. With the system powered on, but we were only getting parts of a messages, or no message at all, The worst aswering machine in the world after a couple of weeks. We went back to a 25 year old machine by AT&T.; We got tired of not getting messages.Buyer Beware!"
4,EZ set up. Sound ???,"Nice design on the unit. Set up was a breeze. The sound quality lacks clarity and gets a ""3"" out of 5. I really like the ability to set the unit on my desk at an angle rather than flat."
1,Bad Answering Machine,"I wouldn't recommend this machine at all. It is easy to use, but I only get parts of messages if anything at all. I need to hear every word of a message, not every 4th or 5th word."
2,garbled,"Machine is easy to use, but the voice quality is terrible considering how good digital recordings can sound. I don't recommend this product. Spend a little more money and get better voice quality."
4,Answering Machine,"Simple to operate. This was a gift, so it was drop shipped and received very fast. Thanks."
5,A great gift,"I was looking for something unique to buy my brother for Christmas. I thought these would do the trick. It is quite entertaining watching everyone play the game. The shock is quite strong, even on the low setting it will cause your fingers to twitch. I would definitely recommend these. The tanks were easy to control and fun to play with."
3,Quite a shock,These were a huge hit. They do give quite a shock though. If you don't have the wrist strap on most people will drop (or worse yet) hurl the controller across the room when they get hit. They did not last long though (the reason I did not rate it higher). Within 2 weeks one of the tanks (or the remote) started shocking its user randomly making it impossible to play. This might have been out own fault after dropping the remote a couple times but it started happening on its own and not after a drop.
4,My husband loves this!!,"I bought these for my husband and his friends in Iraq for Christmas. He loved the idea and they all enjoy playing with them. He also said the shock is pretty strong, but they enjoy that! A unique, amusing gift! Thanks for making his Christmas brighter!"
2,so bummed that it didn't work!,"We live overseas and ordered these for our son for Christmas. Got them in July and should have tested them, right away. When we took them out of the box, it turned out that one tank only can win. That is, only one tank actually gives the electric charge. not as much fun that way."
1,Boring & Useless Book,"I rate this book with ZERO stars. I show one star because that is the minimum the Amazon system requires to issue a review.This old book on photometry is boring and difficult to understand. It was written 100 years ago and the units used are archaic, the language obsolete, and the technology cited stone age. Furthermore the scanning technique used to reproduce this book is very poor.I threw this book out, it is useless. Don't waste your money buying it."
5,It's about introspection and being practical,"This book is for lawyers who think they want change. Because of the laser-point intellectual focus required to launch a successful legal career, many lawyers find themselves at year 10 and wonder how they ended up ""there."" Self-examination is a luxury few in big firms afford, but it's critical to establish and maintain the right career path.This book guides a reader's introspection, but also offers practical tools for the lawyer genuinely interested in exploring alternatives to a traditional career in a law firm.A note in response to the reviewer who suggested that ABA publications were inferior...My experience with ABA publications is the opposite. The ones published by the Law Practice Management section are varied, timely and well-researched."
3,What it lacks in quality it makes up for in style,"This is a HUGE hat! If you are looking for a movie-star style hat to lay by the pool in (and cover your entire torso in shade), this is the dude. Just don't intend on it staying together too long- it is made of very thin straw and has a bit of a flimsy feel to it. Overall, it's great- you wouldn't want to wear this hat to do yardwork, so it serves it's very glamorous purpose."
3,Not like the picture,The shape is nice but pay attention to the written description not the picture. It is truly a black and white hat not a natural straw color anywhere.
2,HUGE sunhat,"I was in the market for a large sunhat when I bought this Large Brim Straw Beach Floppy Hat. However, I failed to understand just how large and floppy this would be. It is so big that the brim does not stay up on its own. You have to hold it or be prepared to have it cover your face. On the beach or on a boat, this can be extremely annoying if you are talking to people. However, it does provide great protection from the sun since it covers your entire face (and your shoulders and some of your back!). I would say be sure you understand just how big this hat is before you buy it. Also, do not fold this up, it does not easily bounce back to its original form. The thatch on this is widely woven so some light does shine through but it's no different from many straw beach hats. The actual hat color is more grey than black because of how it is woven with the white straw so do not expect it to be solid black or stripped black and white."
3,Disappointed,"The ""Shark"" item image differs from the product described (& therefore supplied). The delivered item is actually light grey in colour with matching coloured stitching.I preferred the white top with contrasting grey stitching, as shown in the photo, but due to the distance involved (I live in the UK) I'm resigned to accept the delivered goods.Shame because the items appear to be genuine Champion products, are competitively priced and arrived in reasonable time."
4,good quality at an reasonable price,"Overall considering the price and the material itself, I've already purchased 3 of them (But Under Armour still is better but not always worth it)"
2,Not Pleased,The long sleeve red T-shirt was outlined in WHITE which was not what the picture depicted. Both shirts were 'seconds' and would not have been the same size once washed. I have returned them.Sue EdingtonCustomerChampion Men's Double Dry Long Sleeve T-Shirt
5,EVERY SON AND DAUGHTER SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!,"This is an excellent book for those who share the view that we should love and care for our Fathers. They provide for the family and very rarely get any appreciation or credit for their unsung work. I have an 89 year old father who has Alzeimers. many of my brothers and sisters believe that they are doing themselves a favor by not seeing him anymore. This is very selfish of them. You know when you love your Dad when you stick by him and Honor him, even if he can no longer recognize the gesture. May God continue to bless the Russert family. Thanks Tim for your wonderful example of being a Good son as well as a good Father."
5,Tim Russert was wonderfully wise to compile this book!,"Author Tim Russert (of NBC's Meet the Press) struck a chord with his previous book about his dad, titled Big Russ & Me. When he received thousands of letters from readers about experiences with their own dads, he realized he had truly touched many. Wisdom of our Fathers is a wonderful compilation of those letters about readers' dads and how they shaped and influenced their families. Some entries are brief, some lengthy. Many are humorous, all are poignant in some way. From 19th century dads to 21st century dads--country and city, poor and wealthy, all are included. Russert ties them all together with more information about his dad, Big Russ, as well as Russert's son, Luke, and Russert's role in fathering him. I found this to be a delightful read, one to linger over, enjoy and ponder. Author Russert hit the bullseye with his universal theme of generational influence. Let's hope for more offerings from Tim Russert."
5,Tim Russert,"Tim Russert has always been a favorite of mine and ""Wisdom of Our Fathers"" didn't disappoint me. It was a perfect Father's Day gift for my son-in-law."
4,"Some good stories, a few misses","Russert has distilled a large number of readers' letters into a very readable book. There are a number of truly inspiring stories in this collection. There are, however, a few that were disappointing. I also found a few admittedly minor items rather annoying: the commentary by Russert at the start of each story doesn't really add much; and the chapter on baseball should have been named ""The Yankees"", as Russert manages to ignore just about every other team in the sport in favor of the pinstripes. Still, it's enjoyable to read some of the many ways that fathers influence their children's lives."
5,It's What You Do and Not What You Say--Positive Read!,"Russert has a treasure here! If you're lucky like me, you got another copy just in time for Father's Day...can't wait to give this to my dad. Positive--A REAL Upper!...And reminder of how what we do is more imporant than what we say..."
5,Lovely Book,I bought this book for my husband who was a big Tim Russert fan. He loved the book and so did I!
3,Some very good stories,"Tim Russert, of TV fame, has written another book. This book spawns from earlier book 'Big Russ & Me' (BR&M;). BR&M; is the story of Russerts relationship with his father. From this book, Russert received many letters and messages about other people's relationships with their fathers. Russeert has taken some of these stories and assembled them into this book, 'The Wisdom of Our Fathers'.The book is nicely arranged in different categories, ranging from such topics as 'Tolerance'and 'Missing'. Each chapter opens with a few paragraphs written by Russert to explain the topic, and the letters they contain. I found Russert's chapter openings to be better than some of the letters. While some letters moved me and raised questions regarding my own relationshgip with my father and kids, the majority of the stories were to sappy or not interesting.While I enjoyed this book overall, I was a little disappointed that more of the stories did not hit home with me."
1,"Loyalty, gratitude not among the Lessons??","Mr. Russert, you've repeatedly appeared on the Imus show, droning on endlessly in promotion of your books, and making yourself a fortune in the process. You knew the deal with Imus of course, but since he steadfastly supported you, advancing your agenda and elevating your career, you apparently didn't mind.So where is Mr. Russert now pray tell, with Imus on the ropes??? Has he stepped up to defend the man?? Hardly. I'm tempted to call Little Russ a spineless weasel, but that's a compliment only Imus can rightly bestow.I'll just think it. And tune out."
1,"free letters, BANK","just copies of letters that were sent in for free, yet he never mentions where the money is going to go from the book.Will Lil Russ start selling mugs, t-shirts, and ballcaps a' la O'Reilly? Wouldn't it be fantastic if this bloated gatekeeper shed his lapdog role and actually reported the truth?Timmy is a liberal in wolves clothes, acting like a moderate on his tv show, does he really think he is fooling people???"
1,Horrible,Russert's writing ability is actually worse than his poor interviewing skills. Save your money.
1,The author needs some wisdom and compassion...,"This author would have sold a book to me if he had shown courage and dignity, as well as friendship, in the Don Imus incident. Mr. Imus put this man on the best seller list often and he had him on his show frequently. But Mr. Russert did not come through for Don Imus and unfortunately, I will not spend another penny on Russert's books nor will I ever watch Meet the Press again!"
4,Chicken Soup from our Dads,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. And for the most part, I enjoyed it even though it seemed like a remake of a Chicken Soup book. The one thing I noticed, however, in about 90% of the cases the child did end up doing better in life than the parent. There isn't a much better tribute to a parent. It's what we all wish for our kids."
5,Wisdom of Our Fathers: Lessons and Letters from Daughters and Sons,Books arrived in perfect condition and were given to our sons.
4,KAREN & HER DADDY,"MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW, KAREN & HER DAD ARE AS TIGHT AS 2 PEAS IN A POD. ALTHO THEY LIVE 700 MILES APART, THEY REMAIN CLOSE. THUS, I THOUGHT SHE WOULD ENJOY THIS BOOK & I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. IT'S FOR ANY DAUGHTER WHO LOVES OR HAS LOVED HER DAD UNCONDITIONALLY. IT BRINGS BACK ALL THE WONDERFUL MEMORIES THEY SHARE BUT MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANY SON OR DAUGHTER WHO ENJOYS WALKING DOWN MEMORY LANE."
1,I haven't honked my car horn since this book came out,"Upon reading Tom Brokaw's books, I was inspired to signal even while getting into the turn lane with no one behind me. But that was nowhere near the level of inspiration this book has given me to live a better life.Therefore, effective immediately I will heed Li'l Russ's example and stop honking my car horn. If there is a safety hazard or I become impatient, I'll just yell out the window. Everything changed on 9/11."
2,"Not useless, but not necessary either...","I got it as a package deal, but once I opened it I didn't think it was really worth my trouble. Get it if you like long list of contact and extra characters in your game. or if your running low on run ideas it has a few suggestions."
5,local paper for readers interested in local news,"Great coverage of local news, events, sports, busines, and politics plus national and world news coverage from wire syndicates such as Associated Press. Also includes photos and tables from several articles."
4,Love it!,"Love it. Great mix of local and national. All the local headlines with the major national ones so you don't feel in the dark. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because even though it does include photos, I wish there were at least a few more per issue."
4,Great job Spokesman!,I read this daily. It is an excellent way to get the local news from Spokane and the surrounding areas. Please add the weather and fix the occasional article glitches. i have also noticed the paper has not been delivered to the device on occasion.
3,Times are changing,"I love sitting down with the paper every morning, but it seems so passe now with all ourinstant information bombarding us every moment."
3,Spokesman - basic content is all there,"I've downloaded several daily versions of the Spokesman onto my Kindle Fire when I have been out of town. I would say it's ""OK"". The basic content of all news articles is there to read. There are no pictures. Certain things don't come through - like sports schedules or tv schedules. No comics either. And there is no access to localized portions of the newswpaper (like the ""Valley Voice"" section) - this is understandable since different parts of the City receive different versions. Regardless of the shortcomings, I am glad that the paper is available for download at a reasonable price."
3,GET COUNTER HACK INSTEAD,"I could not read past pg 60 or so. It's esentially a hacking for dummies series, that's how bad the layout is. A better book that brings it all together is Counter Hack by Ed Skoudis."
1,RUBBISH,"A lot of twaddle - worst book on the subject - no secrets, out of date solutions - a complete waste of time and money"
1,Save Your Money,"I have plenty of experience with computers and have been hacking since the term Hacker wasn't a dirty word. Anyway, a friend of mine that is very interested in Hacking purchased this book and a few other titles from these authors. He showed me the books and asked me to give him my opinion of them. As I was looking thru these books I started to laugh and told my friend to get his money back. I was shocked to see that all the info in these books can be obtained just by doing a search on SecurityFocus and Google and most of the info in this and the other books where outdated exploits that have been patched already. The IT industry moves at the speed of light and the most important aspect when it comes to securing your networks is having the newest attack and exploit information, which no book can ever provide... including this lousy book that is nothing but a compilation of what can be found for free online. Don't waste your money! I wish I could give this book zero stars."
4,Too shallow wireless section.,"I bought this third edition, mostly because of the claims about covering wireless security area. Well, as it turned out, this 'coverage' includes just three lousy pages !!The book is very like the second edition. No relevant changes are presented, and therefore several issues are now dated.If you don't already own the second edition, then buy this new third edition, overall, it is a quite comprehensive and useful book. However, if you are looking for a serious wireless security treatment, then you should better try books like ' Hack Proofing Your Wireless Network' or alike."
4,Not too shabby.,"The author does a really nice job talking about network hacks. He sounds like he still hacks into networks on the side since the book contains so much information. The book is not exhaustive (no book can be about this subject) but covers the most important topics about hacking and security. If you want a good introduction with _some_ depth to it this is the book. It's good book to start with if you haven't read anything else. It's a fun read with some good points. After this, you'll want to buy other security books that go into a specific area with a lot of depth to it. Maybe you could go into the specific Hacking Exposed books on Windows or Linux, etc. Definitely should be part of your library."
4,Algebra of the Bible,The Charts alone on this book make the book well worth reading. The strange (algebraic) numbers in Mark 8:17-21 are dealt with. I challenge anyone to come up with a better explanation. Mr. Palmer in his book also solves the conundrum of why Mathew omits 4 names and Luke adds 1 name in their genealogies. One could go on and on about the different patterns in the Bible as brought out by the author.His hope was that others could go on from what he has discovered and maybe even give us greater insight into this amazing book.Terry
4,cheap batteries???,"O.K. you can buy cheap batteries,but not for This razor. they have a nipple thats about 3/8 "" long that fits up into the razoryou cannot use conventional battriesin this razor"
3,Not a close shave,"Does not shave as close as the pricer models and the battery's run our fairly quick, and no trimmer. The replacements battery's are lithium so expect to pay around $9 every 2 months. Very lightweight and compact, and great for a small carry-on the plane item or when space is at a premium."
4,Women's Lacrosse Training Book,This is an excellent tool for getting a better understanding on how to support and help my daughter improve in lacrosse. I wanted to play an active role by getting the book as well as equipment for both of us. Now we toss the ball to each other and practice what we've read in the book. She's definitely getting better.
1,this item will be delayed for weeks,"I ordered this collar two weeks ago and since then I have not received it.When I contacted the seller a simple reply was made ""waiting for shipping information""The item is listed as in stock but it will take 3 - 4 weeks to receive it so be aware of one month delivery time!!"
2,Duro-Med soft foam cervical collar,"The foam in this collar is too soft to give sufficiently good support for the neck.Also, because the length is not very ADJUSTABLE, barely 20"" MAXIMUM,it can be uncomfortable if your neck size is 18"" plus, or you're wearing it with a collared shirt.Spend a little more on another brand and you may be happier."
2,Not that great.,"This neck collar was not as supportive as I needed it to be. It was inexpensive though, so not a big investment."
4,"Adjustable, but needs some modification","I bought this collar because I'm 5'1"" and the wider collars are just too big for me. The collar is adjustable in length, but the female side of the velcro is cut very short. if you don't adjust it to its shortest length, then there is an area of male (rough side) velcro that is exposed. I need to sleep with the collar on, and while I slept, the male velcro kept snagging on my pillow case. This pulled the threads of the pillowcase. I solved the problem by using some extra velcro I had in the house. I cut pieces to cover the male velcro that was exposed. It's not a great solution, but it does solve the problem of exposed rough velcro.The material of the collar itself is a medium firmness. That's enough for my needs, but if you're looking for very firm support, this is not the collar for you.Service from the vendor was very good. The collar arrived quickly."
2,Cervical collar,This item was not 2 1/2 inches wide as the info states. Description needs to give more detail. Not useful for my Mom as she has a short neck. The product itself was fine.
3,Gorgeous doll but...,"First off this is one of the prettiest dolls that mattel has to offer, however, shes not exactly the best doll to be played with. First off, her dress is pretty durable, but the little flowers on it are so easily broken off, you have to be really gentle when handling this doll. Second of all, her hair may be long, soft and silky, but its made from a material that knots incredibly easily. I do not recommend spraying this doll with water at all or you will have one big frizz ball for a barbie, to turn her hair different colors, I recommend using the heat from your hands or something that's warm but dry. She comes with all these cool clips and accessories for the hair, her brush, her water bottle, including a hot pink sparkly outfit. Shes wonderful to look at, but use extreme caution when handling this doll because any little movement causes her hair to knot."
1,"Really, really awful","Dreadful. Long, pointless shots with no action or dialog, pathetic plot, and unappealing actors. Want to watch a fat het man chain smoke? Want to watch a skinny gay girl sob? Want to watch them inexplicably, suddenly become best bffs? This is your flick."
2,Hmmmmm,"Can't see how this one ended up winning or being included in two prestigious film festivals (judging by the front cover if I squint hard enough) I have to go with the other negative reviewers I'm afraid on here; this is tacky, stilted, pretentious and just rubbish. The red haired actress and the overweight guy are about as wooden as the chair I'm sitting on and the rest of the cast didn't fare that much better either. Maybe that was down to the script as well I don't know. The tone of this film was just way off - did it want to be a drama? A comedy drama? Both? Some deep and meaningful tone poem about love and life and friendship?Maybe it's just me, but after watching a slew of excellent films of this type (""Elena Undone"", ""Room In Rome"", ""Loving Annabelle"") this one it's safe to say falls WAY short of the mark."
1,"Bad acting, forced dialog. Dumb.","The characters were fake and one dimensional. The dialog was forced and way to grammatically correct. This movie tried to point out all these great meanings in life and huge life lessons without the proper plot or emotion to make it believable. It seemed like an after school special where they are trying to convince you to stop smoking and exercise, and eat right, and follow your heart, but it was all just way to obvious."
3,T O O......S M A L L...!,".Dear Dover:This book, ALTMAN'S SPRING AND SUMMER FASHION CATALOG(UE?), 1915 (ALTMAN'S SPRING & SUMMER FASHIONS CATALOG(UE?) seems an absolute TREASURE-TROVE for those who want to learn fashion illustration, like me.But -- NINE HUNDRED DRAWINGS....IN NINETY-SIX PAGES? These drawings must be soverysmall! I've seen other catalogues of similar date, and know that yes, each page IS filled with teenytinydrawings, and below them, descriptions of items and prices in minisculeprintsize. At least the early ""Sears"" catalogues were like this. Did B.ALTMAN'S, a higher-rung retailer, have fewer drawings per page? But even five drawings per page makes for hardtocopy drawings!If my suspicions are correct, PLEASE re-issue this book -- in larger format, and in several volumes!Thank you!"
5,Inspiring!,"This book is a great example of how illustrations in your journal can add interest and make your memories come alive. Fun ideas, like having friends at the breakfast table draw the salt shaker! Right on! This book really turned my journal writing around making it fun and interesting."
3,"Might be good for you, not so much for me...","I was looking to read this book for a couple of main reasons. First I wanted some motivation in helping me start a journal and second I really wanted some input and guidance on how to use that journal for reflection and analysis of my thoughts and events.This book does a great job of motivating the reader to go out and experience lots of offerings in life and to see the beauty of the world. It makes great references to expanding out and using the journal for drawings and adding photos to it to capture life's moments. I would best characterize the author's interpretation of a journal as a an album of your life containing writings, sketches, and photos that capture your life's events. However, I see that as part of journal; but, also I see a journal as a way to capture your thoughts and events that may be good and/or bad in your life and use it for reflection and I had expected there to be some of that in there in terms of helpfulness to guide that process."
2,Not that impressed,"After reading what others said about it, I was expecting this to be a tremendous book. To start with, it was TINY -- hardly bigger than the palm of my hand.Then, the art was poor. Now, I do appreciate when I don't have to look at pictures that are so good that they discourage me because they're way out of the realm of possibility for me to produce. But, such bad drawings weren't inspiring, either.Finally, some of the suggestions were plain old silly. Getting rid of the camera and only drawing might be OK for a day or a weekend, but not for a longer time frame. When we travel, we want to come home with photos of the sights (and us enjoying them), since we'll probably not return. Why not enjoy BOTH mediums and have the strength of the true-to-life photos along with the fun of sketches?It was an OK book and I passed it on to my son so he'll see that journals aren't just for girls. But, it's not something that will hold his attention and inspire him to new levels."
5,So inspiring and creative,"I have found this book so inspirational, it was exactly what I expected. It has inspired to want to live a life like Dan Prices, creative, free-spririted traveller and explorer, to be at one with nature, not materialistic, and to draw my life for the rest of my live, anything and everything. He has helped me to define my artistic skills and create and appreciate my own style. Will never forget this book, will cherish it forever and refer to it again and again if ever i'm in need of a bit of artistic inspiration."
3,One Good idea,"This was not really what I was expecting.My first impression was... This book is tiny.Now that I look back on it I'm not really sure what I was expecting to find inside. Something powerful or exciting that would motivate me into wanting to journal my life. Instead, all I personally got out of it was a clever idea about drawing salt shakers. I found neither his explanation of how to journal nor his actual journal very interesting or motivating."
3,"Fun little book, but fall apart easily","I just love the way it is written and the playfulness of the book.It doesn't teach you how to draw necessarily but ideas what to draw and how to go about it.I like it, but I'm sorry to say that It did fall apart after just a few days."
3,Not as good as the first,"To be honest I didn't even know there was a part 2 until I was listening to one of the songs of the soundtrack which made me look to buy the movie.This movie took me a while to get into. For one Sarah was now played by someone else so it took me a second to realize who was Sarah. Not just that, but it took a little while for the story to really pick up, it just didn't catch your attention from the beginning like the first one. Overall it was not as good as the first one to me, but it wasn't so bad I didn't enjoy watching it, I just expected more since the first one was excellent."
1,Save your money...,on this dance movie. It was a complete waste. I didn't like it. The movie had no flow. Buy the first one it's a million times better.
3,"Old vulture, new culture, folk dance, hip-hop","The speel about hip-hop being everything that went before, just isn't true.On that note, this movie has good music and pretty good dancing as well.The acting and plot is just so predictable.This first movie was a little better.Some time in life the great people just find they have a ""calling""...Late or early that calling is what they are or will become."
2,dance movie,"Realllyyy bad dance movie. The acting was terrible, and it was nothing at all like the first movie. Casting for the character Sarah... just didn't work. I suppose it was worth the like $8 for some small amount of entertainment value (if you really like dance movies), but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,This is one you can miss,Wasn't happy with this one. The actress was not the same one as the first movie.
1,The first one was better...,"I hate this movie the first was so much better. What I didn't like is that they didn't use the same girl and that this girl was not as good of an actress as Julia Stiles...if You are into complete romance and music I suggest that you not buy this movie,it is so boring."
2,First was better,"The movie was not terrible, but I enjoyed the first one much better. I did not care for the acting in this one, it did not flow well. I have seen both the lead actress and actor in other films that they performed much better, so perhaps it was the script that was lacking. As an overall fan of dancing movies I was disappointed in this film."
3,brittle barbie alert,"Be wary of any of the articulated barbies. I have two girls and while most of the barbie dolls survive (we've had around 8, I can't keep count) the two we've gotten with bendable knees have broken under normal play within a few months. The quality of these dolls is questionable at best. They aren't to be played with. This fragility surprises me as the barbies I had back in the 70's (also with bendable legs) never broke apart like this. Guess it hits the bottom line too hard to make dolls that are actually intended to last for more than a few months. Mattel's website for customer support was a dud as well. I know I'm going to have some serious consideration before I buy another Mattel product if this is how they regard their customers.-Disgusted"
3,Good But Not Good,This doll is fun to play with. But its shoes ALLWAYS fall off they never stay on. Over all it isn't a very good doll. If your child wants another dool I would get it.
2,fine if you keep it on a shelf to look pretty,I bought this for my daughter's birthday in Sept. by Dec. the head was broken off and not repairable. My daughter does not play that rough with her toys. I do not recommend this doll for children who want to play with Barbies. She can't take much handling.
5,cool doll !,"i got this doll from my godmother for my brithday, and she is cool! I think any mom should let her daugther play with it!"
5,Do it - good for engine.,"Change you filters often. Whey you do, write the date on the filter so you will know when last changed. Bend filter and look down into pleats, if dirty, replace it."
1,Can't rate,I made a mistake and ordered the wrong type of air filter.I had no problems with the order though.
1,Does not fit 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid,"According to the dropdowns, this filter is what fits on a 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid... guess what, it doesn't. Got it like 20 minutes ago - went outside to put it on and nada. I rated a 1 Star for that reason. Amazon shipping was great... Amazon is great. But now I have to return this filter and get another. Already found it at Amazon."
4,Good filter,This is a good filter. Slightly bigger than one I have bought from the local auto store. Works fine for the price.
4,"Lovely, but...","I love Barbie, especially Princess Barbies, and I was very excited when this one arrived in the mail. However, I was surprised to find that she does not look like the Barbie in the picture; her eye make-up is fairly harsh, her crown is much larger and not at all delicate, and the bodice of her gown is not form-fitting. She's not ""soft"" in appearance like I expected her to be. The quality of the gown and the doll in general are very good, but I would recommend seeing this doll in person before you purchase her because her appearance really did come as quite a shock to me."
3,"Excellent book on spam filter,but the ""Bayesian Combination Rule"" is not quite correct","I am not a spam expert but an expert on Bayesian. I found this book excellent on spam (history, filters, etc). However, on page 75-76, I couldn't recognize that the Bayesian combination (Paul Graham) formula AB/(AB+(1-A)(1-B)) is related to the Bayes' Theorem P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B). So I went to Paul Graham's website http://www.paulgraham.com/naivebayes.html, where I found that Paul got the formula from http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath267.htm.It turns out that the formula is correct only under two stringent conditions: 1) the tokens (the most spamy words) in a spam email are independent (not related); 2) a spam-filter user should have roughly equal number of spam emails and legitimate emails over time. One can go to the links to find more details.But I still think the formula very usefull and it should be called ""Paul Graham's Combination Rule"" instead."
3,"Very,Very Light Fragant Candle","Having enjoyed all of the Kai perfume & body products, I looked forward to buying the candles (even though pricey) to enhance the mood within my apartment. I was sadly disappointed that the candle emitted only a small amount of fragrance and that's only if you were standing really close to it. There was no difference after several hours of burning. The candles themselves are clean burning in shot glasses. I'm hoping that their future candles will be infused with more perfume oil. If you decide to buy this product, I suggest you burn more than one at a time."
3,Rather Disappointing to Me.,"After reading the rave reviews on this site, I purchased this DVD with high expectations.I am disappointed.CONS - The picture is blurred and grainy, much like that of an over-used library video. Ghostly black stripes, just subtle enough to distract, roll constantly from the left of the screen to the right. They aren't as prevalent in the beach and campfire scene as they are in the fireplace scene. Darkening the screen helps somewhat.Some reviewers have complained about the fake logs, but they look real enough to me. The beach scene has some weird background going on. That's the creepiest surf I've ever seen.PROS - The sound quality is very impressive. The snaps and pops are distinct. It sounds like a real fire. I like the fact that there is no annoying background music. The fire never dies down or goes out.If you're looking for picture clarity...keep looking. This DVD doesn't have it."
4,No Jive!,"I got this Dvd for christmas to play in my dorm room, and I really love it. I don't care if they are real logs or not, whatever. I'm just happy that the picture is as high quality as it is. All you folks out there talking jive about how it is a fake fire with fake logs, seriously, it's a fire on tv...think about what you're saying. Go get yourself a real fire if your gonna be cranky."
4,This was a gift for my husband.,He loves it! Especially the fire on the beach which has the sound of the waves and the crackle of the fire.
5,"Lovely, lovely, lovely","Nice thing about this is that it give you choices -- either use the traditional winter fireplace fire or go beyond winter coziness and a choose a nice campfire near the ocean for summer use. Good crisp photos. Relaxing real sound. This and the ""Sierra Nevada Log Cabin fireplace"" are the best two fireplace videos."
5,Flames,We used this for our Thanksgiving day and it was wonderful! It really does feel like there is a fire right next to you and you don't even have to add any logs! My friends loved it and wanted one for themselves. Happy Camping!! :)
4,"Infinite flame, no progress, ambient use only!","This dvd is great if you do not purchase it intending to sit back and watch the story unfold. The fire continues for 30 minutes then restarts. This is the equivalent of a lava lamp, which is cool, but not an annual focal point. You can never replace a real fireplace and the closest concept would be to record a number of entire burnings ... expand here if you wish. I gave this four stars because there is a purpose for which it would be excellent, but it is not up to universal par."
3,goood product but slightly grainy resolution,"There is nothing wrong with this product, but if yo have high def, get something else, this doesn't even take advantage of dvd resolution capabilities..."
2,It's just not a Fireplace,Well i don't have much to say.I recommend this DVD to:-Anyone who enjoys watching Fire on the TV!I don't recommend this DVD to:-Anyone who want's to turn his TV into a real Fireplace.Scene Quality is good but definitely there is something fake.
3,Definitely fake.,"the logs are fake and don't actually burn. the flames flicker too quickly to look believable. either the gas pressure is too high, or the video is sped up for some reason. no burning coals, smoke, or embers at all, so the sound (although good) is also fake.the campfire scene is more of the same, except from a wider, outdoor shot, but the only thing that burns is the gas.the beach ""bonfire"" is pitiful. bonfires are supposed to be big. but since they're using gas, i guess small was safer. the waves in the background are on crack. again, they sped up the video for some reason. and it's clearly a cut and paste job. the sound (although nice, again) doesn't actually match the waves and fire.the good: scenes are stationary, sound is nice and makes the scenes believable. fireplace can be left on for long periods of time without getting annoying.the bad: it's not a real fireplace, so if that's what you want (like i did) don't get this one."
5,Thorough and broad,"The June edition of the Butler series has two very lengthy sections on the lives of St. Peter and St. Paul. The editor did an excellent job of summarizing the sources. This series has been quite thorough and broad and emphasizes the accuracy of the sources. Kathleen Jones introduction of this volume gives on overview of the well-known and lesser known saints of this month. I appreciate the stress she places on what is conjecture and what can be proved, almost. This edition does not delve in cultic devotion, but presents each saint as accurately as possible."
4,Would purchase one again,"I didn't give this a 5 star only because we have had it only for a week. So far this product hasn't let us down! It is very quick and effecient. I hope it lasts long, only because my husband is going on a burning spree! He says it is one of the best ones he has had!"
1,Memorex Internal CDRW DRIVE 52X/32X/52X EIDE ( 32023257 ),"I purchased this item on August 27, 2006, today, February 2, 2007 it died."
3,SUPRISE guest,"well i u never heard of wwc or never heard the album. for information there is a special guest on ""felicity's surprise"" named Wes C. Addle (aka Ed Vedder of Pearl Jam which Matt has been playin drums for the past 3 years)"
2,WATCH-OUT!!!!!!!,"Gaskell has a good book here, but there are more mistakes per chapter than any book I have used. The mistakes aren't grammatical or anything (he he), but instead, they are mistakes in formulas and example problems -> where it counts!"
1,Materials Science & Metallurgical student from Michigan Tech,"Thermodynamics is already a hard enough subject to learn. If you want to learn thermo this is the wrong book for you. Gaskell confused my whole class so much that we hardly even used this book, fortanetly we had a good professor that was able to make sense of what Gaskell had to say. There are so many errors in this book that it is pathetic not just in the answers but also in the tables that Gaskell provides. Gaskell himself came and lectured our class this term. Luckly for him it was early in the term when we were just starting to use the book, if he had came in later in the term he would have been beaten senseless with this horrible book."
2,Hard text,"Thermodynamics is one of those topics covered in multiple branches of science such as physics, chemistry, geology, materials science, chemical engineering, etc... This book approaches the subject from materials science and is meant to serve as the book for a one or two semester course in thermo. First of, it is not meant for beginners to thermo. I used this book in a course taught by one of the best instructors in my department, after having taken two easier courses in thermo. Yet I still found it difficult. Second, the math is advanced enough that one should not take the course without having differential equations. Third, the example problems can get quite difficult real quickly; and not all have solutions. But overall, the text is a good reflection of the subject; difficult and time-consuming to master."
3,Several major deficiencies,"There are several significant problems with this book, in addition to the errors that others cite:1. Overly long explanations that lead nowhere - Several times I've found that even after reading the chapter, I've had to look elsewhere for important equations, perhaps the author expects that any useful equations we can just derive ourselves based on what he gives.2. No solutions for the problems - It gives the final answer (usually), but no explanation of how to get there.3. Poor examples - The examples often seems completely unrelated to the content discussed elsewhere in the chapter and then often unrelated to the problems. Additionally, the examples aren't integrated into the material, they're just put at the end, so you have to read the whole chapter before you can find out what parts are useful and what parts are just background information.I rated it a 3 as I don't actually have any other thermo textbooks to compare it to, but this book doesn't set the bar very high."
2,Not a great text,"I used this text in a thermo of materials course after using the Gyftopoulos text for a general thermo course. In comparison, I found the Gaskell text horrible. For a 4th ed, there are a tremendous number of typos and equation errors, the nomenclature is a little odd, and the equations aren't general, they inherently assume P = 1atm etc. I don't recommend this text."
5,Very well focused,This book is a very good one very well focused on the thermodynamics of materials. I highly recommend it and I use it for the Materials Science Master degree program at University of Juarez
2,"not timely delivered, the condition of the book is not good","not timely delivered, the condition of the book is not good"
1,Bad book,"I think Dr. Gaskell does not understand the basic stuff of communication. I hate the book when there are whole page of description of the figure, and then the figure is on the next page. How can you read and then flip the page again and again? The other thing is why couldn't it be a letter size paper? It is so hard to read with such a small size of paper with tons of equations over and over again. Despite the error of the book, the page design make it such a bad book. And the most unfortunately thing is, I had a bad professor, who thinks we know everything and we are actually super confused. Don't use this book at all."
2,Bad Book,"Text book should be printed in normal text book size; the book is so small (length and width) and thick that it will not stay open. The theroy and examples within the chapter do not provide enough detail to answer questions at the end of the chapter, similar to those found on my exams."
3,Dave R,"I stopped reading the book because it was pretty boring. However, this is a book on thermodynamics, so it is expected to be pretty dry material (i.e. not too fascinating). The solutions in the back of the book or wrong half of the time. If you are in a bind this book will work. I would recommend looking around for other books. The guy that wrote this is from Purdue engineering (last time I checked), which is a pretty good engineering school (that adds some solid credibility to the author's knowledge). The disc that comes with it is a joke (I don't know why they even included it). All around, I would look for another thermo book on materials."
2,No zoom functionality for e-book,"The tables in the back of the book have a very small default font size, and for Kindle for PC there is no zoom function. Without superhuman eyes I was unable to read some of the key tables, most notably table A-2, the specific heat capacity table."
3,"Introduction to Thermodynamics of Materials, 5th Edittion","Book is cheap but you can get a cheaper one directly from India. They are just getting the book from India and selling it to make a profit from it. It is also paperback book, NOT HARDBACK."
3,Lucky to get 3,"Lets put it this way: The book sits unfinished collecting dust on my coffee table with about thirty-five pages left. I will not completely bash it, for it is an honorable introduction for some to sci-fi, but for those who are veterans of the genre, don't expect too much.I picked up the book because I was interested at some 'On-the-sea' writing and was convinced by other reviews that this book was just what I was looking for. Well, thankfully it is pretty easy reading, because I did not want to spend much time on it. I will finish it one of these days, but I am not excited to find out what happens to the very predictable storyline...which is full of outrageous coincidences. For instance: a ship in the distance breaks apart on the rocks, all sailors are lost except for one man, the same man Rol, the lead character, befriended in a bar two years ago. Its a bit wishy-washy and not epic in the least.Beginners only."
3,Focuses on rebinding damaged books.,"This book has some neat tricks if your sole goal is rebinding an old or damaged book, but it doesn't have much to offer if you're interested in making your own bindings from scratch. It focuses on glue bindings, and doesn't really teach anything in the way of sewing. If you're looking to actually pick up the craft, you'd be better served by other titles."
1,Dumb,"I love reading Ms Stuarts books...usually. But this one was pushing the envelope a little too far. Dr Elizabeth Holden is called to a remote island to study a man who has been in the wild his whole life. She discovers that they have drugged him and have beaten him. She puts her life in danger to save this ""Tarzan"".. Well, you'll discover that things aren't the way they're suppose to be. The writing is very deceptive and not believable."
3,A delightful triumph over common sense,"This book boast an outrageous, audacious plot (by Ms Stuart's own admission in an interview). But what do you know - I fell for it. Possibly because it was one of the first romance books I'd read for a long time (anyone more familiar with the genre should have predicted the mid-way ""twist"" on which so much hangs), and perhaps also because I was on vacation so my brain probably wasn't quite in gear. But to give credit where it's due, the fact that I could read this with pleasure without my brain howling in protest (though my credulity did whimper a little) is testament to Ms Stuart skill and mastery of her art. As with all romance fiction, don't expect anything intellectual, but hopefully if you are in the right frame of mind you will enjoy an undemanding and fun read."
5,I'd give it ten stars if I could,"Anne Stuart once again proves why she's my favorite author. She takes my most primal fantasies, both sexual and emotional, and sets them to prose the way a master composer sets words to music. This Tarzan/King Kong/Beauty and the Beast story captivated me from the very first page. It was sheer perfection from start to finish and I was flipping pages like crazy toward the end. (I kept picturing Meg Ryan as Elizabeth.) My only complaint was that it could have gone on for 800 pages and it still wouldn't have been enough. WILD THING, I think I love you!"
2,ouch - loses everything on power failure,"I am surprised that the cheap AT&T; answering machine we got 4 years ago still outperforms this new machine. GE really didn't get a few things right on this.The biggest problem is that on power failure it loses outgoing message, time, and worst -- all your incoming messages. This is simply unacceptable. They do have a 9v battery backup, but a year later that will be dead and you could lose messages. My older digital (not tape) machine doesn't have this problem, and when I can get a 16GB SDRAM card for my camera for $25, it seems they can solve this problem :)Recorded voice quality of the outgoing message is worse than current machine - a little crackly. No way to rewind a few seconds, just go back to start of message.Aside from that it seems an OK machine, but the memory problem is a real death cookie for us."
3,Voice mailboxes a bit confused,"Like answering part of the machine, but don't like the voicemail boxes part. Seems too confusing to set up mailboxes, and everything seems to go through the first mailbox anyway. maybe I just didn't do it right..."
2,Hard to understand,"I really wanted a three mailbox machine and found this one. Had received good reviews so I was pretty sure it would work as expected. Disappointed with the item as it is very, very difficult to understand and the only way to delete a message is to play it and hit the delete button while the message is replaying (my previous machine had a button to delete all old messages which worked great)."
5,GE Digital Answering Machine,"This is the one I have owned since the 90s..there was a model made in the early 90s which I still have to this day. At first I didnt like the 3 mailboxes. But if you just leave a regular message it will go into the mail mailbox...easy playback, easy to set the date/time.The only feature I didnt like is that if the power goes off, which mine does you lose the messages so Im looking for an updated GE that has a power saver.After all these years its been on 24 hours a day since the early 90s and now its 2007, thats about 15 years worth of no problems and anyone in the house can play it back. That is the great feature, easy to play, delete. GE always had good ideas for simple useage."
5,GE 29861GE2 Digital Answering System w/3 Mailboxes,"Easy to set up and for people to start using right away.Attractive, rounded design with gray-toned buttons arranged in a circle.Flexible--use one mailbox or up to 3.Works fine with phone/fax (in ths case Brother Personal Fax 275).Also received several comments on how pleasant the female voice is that automatically answers calls until (or unless) you change it."
5,Versatile machine at a great price,"The digital answering machine this machine replaced was a piece of junk compared to it. This one has multiple voice mail boxes and two outgoing messages you can switch between. The quality of the recording is good too. You can set how long a message the caller can leave, number of rings before the machine picks up and a security code if you pick up messages from the answering machine on the road. Now let's see how long it lasts."
5,Love this cymbal,Most of my cymbals are dark and this on really adds a bright crisp crash. I really love the 16 inch one. You need to listen to each size because they sound very different. Some cymbals sound pretty similar as they get bigger. The Rude Thin Crash line seems to have its own personality with each size.
3,Not great quality!,"The cage was smaller than expected and the quality was not great. For the money I thought I would be getting something better. Anyhow, the bird is happy and she has a lot of toys and gadgets to play with. The cage, however, comes with great toys and perks to keep your bird happy. Do not recommend for more than one bird per cage."
4,good basic small bird cage kit,"Has a lot of toys and is decent size for a small bird. The water and seed dish, i didn't care for so i bought different ones. no big deal. Only thing, the cage was supposed to be black, with a smoke colored base. The one i received was hot pink cage with black base, but i didn't really care. Bird certainly didn't."
5,Masterful,"I love each of the books in Pentagonia but this one especially stands out as a masterful work by a truly brilliant talent. Perfect as a stand alone read or as the center of the five novels, I cannot recommend this enough.Having read them in their intended order, Farewell to the Sea seemed to anchor the five novels perfectly, fusing the stream of consciousness of Singing from the Well and Palace of the White Skunks and paving the way for the absurdity of The Color of Summer and the dystopian horror of The Assault. Farewell to the Sea places Arenas in the company of Faulkner and Virginia Woolf, but he still manages to forge a niche of his own that is remarkable, stunning and thoroughly rewarding. Read this book."
5,I love it!,"I played the flute in 4th grade and now at 33 years old, decided to pick it back up. The flute came very well packaged and with a little brochure complete with proper care instructions and a fingering chart. I love the case that is slightly bigger than the flute itself to give you room to work when taking it out and putting it away. I was happy that it came with the tenor grease and the cleaning/polishing cloths, too. I've been playing the flute every night for a week for about an hour a night and so far it has been flawless. I love this flute and would've spent more on it if I had to."
4,Good for its value,Bought this flute for my daughter over a year ago and am satisfy with its functionality and value. It plays decently although needed some slight adjustments/tuning. A great value for the price paid. My daughter had been renting an Armstrong that supposedly cost close to $600 but sounded and played no different than the Suzuki. An excellent beginner's flute.
4,Good value for the money,We use this extensively for our daughters school band. Previously we had to rent the instrument every year for almost the same price!! This is an excellent value for the money. As an added bonus we dont have to worry about other users having used the instrument before!!
1,bad quality - do not buy,It only used 3 months and the flute key is leaking air when it press make it impossible to play.It is bad quality. Do not buy this.It is not worth to repair either. So I will just take a lost on this.
3,an unusual experience,"Denver artist Down Low shows no lack of creativity. When I got this, it was an interesting listen to say the least, compared with what I was used to, but a pretty good listen at that. In terms of his delivery, he has a similar style to some various others you may hear on the underground circuit of east coast and west coast rap in general.The producers, Lamonte Harts and R Kashmere make great use of keyboards and synths to create many of their soundscapes, which some are quite unusual sounding, but they manage to pull it off. There is a variety of tracks and even a bit of humour thrown in. It was something different to the norm to listen to, but was fairly effective. Worth a listen if you have the chance, my fav tracks are ""A Boy's Life"" and ""Self Evaluation"". An obscure, but above average album. 3.5 stars."
4,Mr. Carey's Garden of lace.,Mr. Carey is different. His garden is different. He looks at things just a little different. This book offers a wonderful message to young and old. We are different. We like different things. And we do things for different reasons. Come join the snails in Mr. Carey' Garden and find out just how different his garden of lace is.
4,Very Cute,"Went and borrowed this from the library when I was recommended it from amazon.com.....I wish I had known how good it was beforehand, I would have purchased it for my son! It is a very good book to read to your kids, and because of the cute illustrations to go along with the wonderful story, it helps the adults who have to read it over and over again! lol"
4,Littler Shavers will have fun,"This is just what my little grandson needed. He likes to playing ""shaving"" while his dad shaves, so now he can share in some special dad/son time with his own shaver."
2,buyer beware,"I thought this book was going to substantiate and explore the validity of these ""lost books of the Bible"" however there is no actual scriptures in here and what is in the book is paraphrased which in my opinion is inexact at best and misleading all together at worst. This guy seems to lean towards universalism in that all religions lead to the same GOD which is completely unbiblical and utterly false.This book is all about the authors interpretation of the so called lost books and his experiences with them.this book is absolutely useless to anyone trying to get any real knowledge or meaning from the extrabiblical texts.Don't waste your money on this book, but if you still want to buy it let me know and I will sell you my copy!"
4,Nice watch - hopefully it's baby-proof too!,"I ordered this watch because I wanted a nice watch (aka won't turn my wrist green) that I can wear everyday, wherever I happen to be. This watch fits that bill. I will say it is a bit large for me, but I am getting used to it. I like the features that it has and the face it is all stainless (no green!). I figure if it will make it to 100 meters on my next dive trip, it'll survive a dunk in the bathtub with baby or the dishwater. I had to have 2 links taken out and the pin on the clasp adjusted in one notch. My favorite jeweler did this for me for $5. The watch is a bit ""doctorish"" with all the dials and minute markings, but those markings glow in the dark (so I know the baby is waking me up at 3:30 am). I don't have any trouble reading the date on the face, the magnification bubble doesn't bother me... I do notice you need to look pretty much straight at it to see the date number. I have a medium frame and the watch fits well."
3,Nice but not for me.,I'm just not a fan of MOP faces. Missed that in description of watch.I would recommend it to others who like MOP faces. Nothing wrongother than that. It's a very pretty watch.
4,This Russian girl is one cute babe!,"I bought this calendar, and I thought most of the pictures were very nice. I wish I could be with her!"
2,Does Your Child Really Need Glasses?,This book is fine if you are intersted in very basic imformation about eye care. If you child is experiencing problems do not let this be your only resource. My six year old was just diagnosed with amblyopia (lazy eye)and I have done a lot of research. This books gives some very bad and possibly dangerous advice about treating amblyopia with an eye patch. Please double check any of the advice this book provides before you start treating your child's eye problems.
2,Didn't like,"I didn't get much out of these ear candles. It was my first time candeling and they were easy to use, but I personally didn't see any results for the amount of time it took."
1,does NOT work!,"I, too conducted an experiment by lighting one without inserting it in anyone's ear canal. I ended up getting the same results as I did when I tried it on a friend. The dark yellow waxy ""chunks"" are actually residue from the inside of the candle when it burns. What a waste of money."
5,Recommended reading for VW Bug all fans & owners.,All who have owned and love VW Beetle cars will find this a fine keepsake: a celebration of the bug which packs in photos with memoirs and a fun set of recollections of owners. My Bug will appeal to any with a fond memory of their 'bug years' as well as new fans of the model.
4,a good fps,at begining I felt like I was playing halo but it wehnd down after 1 hour playing. still a good fps .but not that good as halo.
1,World's worst manual,"If you're a professional in the lighting industry this board may be easier to understand. If you're thinking that out of the box you can plug this unit in and read through the manual and quickly get up to speed, you have another thing coming. The manual for this product is one of the worst I have ever come across in any industry. It dedicates 1-2 pages for each major function of the board. There are no useful examples of anything; it assumes you are intimately familiar with all sorts of stage lighting terminology. The end result is confusing and chaotic. Using the board as a real time manual control is easy enough. But programming scenes and other functions is extremely confusing. I cannot recommend this unit and if I could take mine back, I would."

1,"Unintelligible, even for experts","Some rent seeking editor seems to have collected a pile of Professor Minsky's papers and wrapped them in a snazzy title for public consumption. Although unintelligible to the lay reader, Minsky is justly renowed for his financial instability hypothesis, which holds more or less that investment demand is hostage to the varying price of long lived capital assets and shifts in the debt carrying capacity of financial actors. He divides financial techniques as Julius Caesar divided Gaul: there is Hedge Finance, Speculative Finance and Ponzi Finance (guess which is unsustainable). Exactly how this works is largely a matter of faith and of course calculus for the initiated. The important thing to know is that equilibrium is unsustainable, crisis a recurring theme. Those who read the newspapers already know that. Rather than wasting money on this book, those interested should Google 'Financial Instability Hypothesis'. Excellent two page summaries abound."
2,too heavy,"This book was recommended by a doctor friend of mine as one of the famous self help novels. But after I started to read it, it appeared to be too heavy reading for my liking. This reading maybe more suited for a 3rd year college reading text instead of light reading."
1,be a dj featuring jam master jay,this is a very bad product. i would not sugest it to anybody.it was a big waste of money. This dvd is for someone that has never herd about djing.
3,really wanted to like it,"I really wanted to like this book, has maps, directions ,pics, but the book is old, and the writer is complaining too much about how bad it is in 1980! so I got out my hikes with children and gave this the heave ho.some new writer needs to make a new one with out all the fussing."
4,Great CD. makes me think way back,"ok, i may have been 10 or so when this came out, but I recall we had this Album, and all the grown ups playing the entire album it was like 7 songs, most of them where very long (over 6 minutes). I loved prayin, and Tonight! they where my jams. Glad i found this CD, as it's very rare."
1,witman boys,the product review for this movie was not as it said. bad acting plus the movie script was not very good. to bad i paid good money for this. dont waste your money on this movie.
3,meant for electric stoves,"like the device overall but its not meant for flame stoves, which i didnt realize earlier. first time I used it the plastic handle melted off"
2,grease around the valve?,"I got this today and found some grease around the nut of valve, both inside and outside.It says wash only water but without soap, grease won't go away. The inside actually smell like grease. Maybe I'll call and ask about this."
1,got too hot!,"This little guy can't get too hot! I made the mistake of ordering the one cup size, meaning I had to make several cups in the morning, and it got so hot that the handle melted off. I'd only had it a week. ): Get the bigger size and watch the heat!"
3,"good espresso, really small!","makes decent espresso most of the time (and looks cute) but its really small. Only one shot! No more. I use it to make ""decoction"" for indian coffee, and I wish the espresso was stronger and I could get a little bit more espresso so that I can make 2 cups of (desi) coffee. I wish there was a 2 cup model. Also not diswasher safe, which is a bummer."
5,Expresso Pot,"Purchased as a recommendation from a friend in an online group - the conversation must have sold at least 20 of these pots for the manufacturer, and everyone seems to be very pleased with their purchase. I know that I am! Produces a great tasting cup of coffee (small expresso cups)and is really easy to use. I'm hooked! Have to have a cup around 3:00 P.M. every day! High quality, and as per my friend's recommendation, I bought three replacement gaskets."
4,Great Product,"I drink a lot of espresso, and this product makes equal or better espresso than some coffee shops around me. Realize that this product does not produce a thick espresso with lots of crema like you would get in Rome, but is is very good and I use it every day. But also understand that the expensive espresso machines like Breville will not give you a thick, ""authentic"" espresso (I used a die cast Breville for awhile). What really matters are freshly roasted beans, ground right before you brew. That will make the biggest difference.This produces an espresso with full body, not watered down, hot, fast, and is easy to clean. I have had no problems with corrosion. I use the smallest size (1-cup) and am happy with the product."
5,Best coffee if used the right way,"I bought this product after trying coffee produced with a similar moka that my girlfriend bought on her 1-month trip to Italy. It is a quite curious thing that her moka pot was bought at Italy but made in China, and mine was bought here at Amazon and made in Italy: the magic of Internet.Great coffee pot, however, it will only produce great coffee if used the right way with good coffee beans ground the correct way. Also it must stay on low flame the right time. After getting the hang of it, you will certainly enjoy a great strong coffee in espresso-sized quantities; as you certainly do not expect this moka to produce a typical american supersized jumbo mug cup of coffee. Great things come in small quantities, no need to supersize everything."
2,Bialetti Moka 3 cup,"I like the coffee maker, but it's starting to get all rusty and old-looking inside already...after 1 month of usage."
4,SEIS-UNO-NINA Representin',"...Young Sicc rocks this album, get it and bump this SD local in yo ride.Peace.- Ruen Kloze- Tribal Gear - Wildstyle Technicians-"
3,It's not the original but works!,Product serves for its purpose an length leaves a lot to be desired. If you have broken only the cable which connects to notebook use the other part without AC together in order to have a longer reach.Supplier was very fast and packing was nice and tight.
4,Great Figure with one Flaw,This would be the Best superman figure ever if they had made the cape removable. That way he would be less bulky otherwise awesome figure.
5,"Outboard Engines: Maintenance, Troubleshooting and Repair",it is exactly what I was looking for. It allowed me to break down and rebuild my motor and has allowed my wife and I to use our boat and it has given us a great deal of pleasure cruising around our lake.
1,The author must the other reviewers,"This book tells you next to nothing about your engine. I could have opened the cover on my engine and dinked around and figure out almost all the information in the book in one hour. Minus a few broad and VERY general tips, this book will frustrate the buyer. You might as well search the web for the free web pages and get their rink dink advice; because that's all that is in this book."
2,Dust Collector,"Good intentions but no substance. If you own an outboard, you know that each size and brand are quite unique and generalizing the repairs of them is about as useful to an owner as a dry lake. This book is very small and it WILL collect dust or end up beneath a repair manual. Believe me."
3,Small Yuymmy,"The panforte was wonderful. I wish it were available all year long. My ""complaint"" is that it is very small for the bucks. I should have paid more attention to the size before I ordered."
2,Not the one pictured,"While the box has the same picture (orange gasket, metal frame, metal screen), the one inside was not the same. Has the metal frame, but a black gasket and no metal screen. If the screen is something you care about, be warned."
2,MUDDY WATERS SURROUND THUNDER ISLAND,"Meryl!!! What happened? Thank goodness I didn't read this MS book first. I would have written her off totally. A poor plot with too much technical and terrorist information which did nothing to help the story line. The main characters are boring and underdeveloped. I have to agree with the reader from Boston, Mass who complained about the simplistic language. This is not a keeper. Throw it back! If you haven't read Tempting Fate, Trust No One, Half Moon Bay, etc., you're in for a treat. Buy them. You won't be disappointed."
3,I would pass on this book...,A great fun start but the main male character was too perfect to make this an enjoyable read. The bases of the story is women leaves her husband after the wedding and she finds her way to a town named Paradise and to the 'perfect' man. I would pass on this book.
3,"Yummy ideas, but missing instructions","In preparation for a trip to Death Valley for Thanksgiving, I am wading through a number of ""D.O."" cookbooks. This book has the best recipes by far, as noted by others here, but it doesn't include instructions on how to cook with a D.O. -- i.e. how many briquets to use, where to place them, how to adjust the temperature. Perhaps a lot of ""seasoned"" river runners like the authors have been doing it so long they assume everyone knows how, but a basic book should include basic instructions. If you're needing that info, check out ""Lovin' Dutch Ovens,"" by Joan S. Larsen. The recipes are more Betty Crocker-ish (and in some cases frightening), but the instructions go over sizes, quantities and temperature control -- a must for most people in the market for a D.O. book. Oh and, BTW, once you know how to cook in a D.O., the reality is you can pretty much cook any of your favorite recipes."
3,Too Complicated,All the recipes are pretty advanced (and expensive). I'd like to see more easy dishes that don't take 5 hours to prepare and $100 per oven.
1,This Book is Political Garbage,I wanted abook on Dutch ovens NOT a book on political opinions. TO the author if you want to dispose you Liberial Socialist Ideas don't do it in a Dutch oven book.
4,"Great recipes! Eco-preachy tho,cooking with the green ranger",Fantastic recipies it this book! A little short on instruction for the beginner and a bit long on environmental lectures. Great book for liberal Democrats that don't think protecting the wild applies to them. Broad range of culinary styles. Well written and worthwhile.
5,The Outddor Dutch Oven Cookbook,"I just love this book! I gave it to several of my friends for Christmas and they are having a ball with it! Thank you Amazon for handling the book! It has the best, most interesting recipes of any Dutch oven cookbook with lots of helpful information."
5,The Outdoor Dutch Oven Cookbook,"This is well organized and appealing book for outdoor cooker. If you have cast iron dutch oven, you have to have this one.Dominic Lee from Seoul, Korea."
4,Very Good Book For Women Golfers,"I read this book and found it very interesting. The book is from a women's perspective in all aspects. Kellie even addresses annoying things such as men giving unsolicited advice. That is such an annoyance for me, so was glad to see it addressed."
3,Disappointed,"Although the book itself is in good shape, I was disappointed in the cover. It is a bit faded and has small tears. The cover of the book is plain so it really does need a cover."
4,Enjoyed it!,"Great book for the beginner. Really helped me with my game. Answered all my stupid questions. When I walked out on the course the first time, I already knew golf etiquette. Surprised my fiance that I knew so much. Great if you want to understand golf on TV as well."
3,Beginning book purchase used copy,"I purchased a ""used"" copy from amazon and would highly recommend that others do the same. I paid $2.00 for the hardcover and the book arrived in new condition. This is a beginning book and after a few rounds of golf or a few lessons you will have no further need for it. I am a beginning golfer and the book served its purpose and have sinced moved on. However, you cannot beat that $2.00 price tag for a new book."
3,Very simple and basic,"If you are looking for the very vvvvvery basics this book is fine. It was a little too basic for me, I wound up purchasing a different book."
3,Suitable but not the best,"Very pricey book for such basic information. Liked Vivien Saunders, golf handbook for women and thought Golf for dummies was excellent. And of course everyone should read golf is a woman's game one of my all time favorites. The women's guide to golf is suitable but not in the top 10."
4,"True to its title, a handbook for beginners","I first picked up this book when I just started playing golf. It taught me the fundamentals of the grip, swing, ball position-the basics to play golf. At the time, it was a pretty good book, but as I have progressed I need a more comprehensive book.Overall, this book is good for beginners, as the title indicates."
3,great graphics,"the graphics are great, but the 2 player game mode is limited it is a fun game for awhile, but I lost interest in the gameplay after a few hours"
3,Costume Jewelery,"The concept for this watch is great-beautiful blue mother of pearl face in a sporty dive watch.It doesn't quite make it though,it looks cheap."
4,"Nice watch, for regular wear and diving.","The watch is a bit bigger than I normally wear for a women's watch, but it is well made, and easy to read. As I get older, I also appreciate the little magnifying glass over the date."
1,disapointed,"Bought the watch In February, only had it about 3 months when the bracelet fell apart then shortly after that the bezel fell off. Needless to say I am very disapointed as I was expecting better, I emailed them and they didn't bother to answer me.I'll be looking for another brand of watch next time. Never buy one of these again."
3,Nice watch,Nice watch but it is a bit chunky. not as streamlined and feminine as I thought it would be. the blue face is nice and has a mother of pearl type of gleam. but if you have small wrists this may be a bit big for you. The weight is noticeable as well.
5,Happy Purchase!,"I was looking for a really nice watch and I found it! Didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars but this totally looks it. Very happy with the purchase. Its a nice weight, beautiful color dial and I've received many compliments. Would def buy again."
2,Too bad - really wanted to like it,"I hate to dislike anything by Jennifer, but I just couldn't get into this. Couldn't find the humor - couldn't get past the unpleasant character to enjoy the satire - for me it flopped. Such a creative, person with the ability to find humor (and, in Clatterford Season 1) mixed with compassion - or absurdity like Ab Fab. I'm waiting for something new from this talented lady - giving this a miss, and sorry to do so."
3,Jennifer Saunders' Vivien Vyle Short Lived TV Series,"I don't understand why the BBC didn't renew this series for at least another 6 shows? It was a little difficult to get into it at 1st but, after watching all six episodes I was really disappointed to find out there weren't anymore to watch. I think if the BBC had made 6 more episodes the show might have developed a big enough following to have survived.I think the biggest problem was advertising the show as a comedy. I would have called it a parody. Some of the topics discussed were far from comedic."
3,Not as good as Ab Fab,"different/dry kind of humor but Jennifer Saunders has magic in anything she writes,smart or satirical. Saunders portrays a talk show host with a group of publicity hungry /quirky characters. All in all a entertaining show. but I will always like Absolutely Fabulous best"
3,Homegrown Hippy Harmonica,"You gotta really love the harmonica to be happy with this CD. I've tried it twice now, but can't get through it. It's not bad, I just can't get through the harmonica and violin to get to the groove. I'd heard a couple of songs from him before buying this that had a quirky, groovy feel to them, that I thought would take me to the acoustic crossover between buzzland and hometown organic. A rare place to go I can tell you, but neccessary once in a while. Anyway, I'm going to keep looking for the right time to try it again so I can hopefully appreciate it. But until I can find it, my advice is to buy it only if you love the sound of a harmonica."
2,BORING,"SEIGAL SCWHALL AS A TEAM, CREATED SOME OF THE MOST DIFFERNTIAL BLUES YOU WOULD EVER HEAR. SOME REALLY GREAT MUSIC.THIS CD AND THE OTHER CDS WITH ORCHRESTERS (SPELLING)??ARE QUITE DIFFERANT THEN WHAT I WAS ACUSTOMMED TO.AS A TEAM SEIGAL/SCHWALL PRODUCED AN ALBULM WITH THE PHILLDELPHIA PHILHARMONIC ORCHRESTER IN THE 70'S THAT WAS PRIME. THESE WITH SCHWALL FALL SHORT. I ACTUALY PICTURED MUSELF WATCHING CARTOONS AS I LISTENED TO THEM"
5,Superb!!!,This could be a textbook on warfare. I highly recommend it to anyone serious on the subject. Marilyn has done it again. She showed what a fool the devil is. I love it!!
3,powder goes up in the air,"i wasn't satisfied with this mix. What really bothered me is when I opened the bag and slowly emptied the flour into a bowl, it just let out a cloud of flour dust into the air while settling into the bowl. It was more airborne dust than I ever had to deal with from any flour! Also, this is a mix and though it says buckwheat, the mix contains less than 50% buckwheat flour, which to me is overpriced. it's more economical and healthy to buy a denser flour, and add your own baking powder and baking soda to it. The taste is okay but I added my own mashed bananas and pumpkin puree to the batter, for more nutrition and flavor."
2,Not at all whay I expected!,"It has been many years since I last tasted Buckwheat pancakes. What I recall is a strong flavor of buckwheat. I couldn't detect any unusual flavor is this mix! It tasted ""neutral""? To be fair, the buckwheat flavor I remember may be limited to the brand I used years ago. Perhaps the Orgran Stonemilled Buckwheat Pancake Mix is more normal? I don't know - but I was disappointed with it."
3,Decent amount of knowledge,"I'm not a student using this book, so I can't give any opinions of it in that aspect. But I can tell you this book definitely is not as useless as others have implied. If you don't understand the basic concepts of Windows 2000 before diving into this book, of course it won't make any sense. Anyone attempting to pursue MCP/MCSE should have years of prior experience. That's the problem with all the MCSEs. They are certified only because they can remember certain information. If you truly know what you're doing, this is a good book.Don't let the unanswered questions at the end of each chapter scare you off. As an ancient zen master once said, ""Seek not to find the answer, but to understand the question."""
1,stay clear of this book,"If you have an instructor that is using this book - then i would not think much of the instructor. The book is obtuse , disorganized and never sufficiently explains anything. It is full of errors and the lab manual that i got with it is aggravating - it is so dry and half witted. Spend your money elsewhere ."
1,Terrible!,"After completing the course at UMUC/Mildenhall, I can say that we (the class) were fortunate enough to have an instructor that did a lot of cross referencing with other text books to clear up a lot of confusing items. The author/publisher didn't even stop to think about including the answers to the review questions in case someone wanted use it for home/self study. If you look at all of the ratings, you'll see that the bad ratings out score the good ratings 9-2. I'm glad I wasn't in the classes that rated this book with 5 stars. There are MUCH better books for your money. Please take note UMUC, Mildenhall."
1,This Book is Horrible,Too bad there is no zero ratings cause this book would defintatly receive it. The two people that gave this book a good rating must have been paid off by the two authors. Or it could be Ed Tittel and James M Stewart rating it five stars. I dont even want to give any more thought about this book cause it's wasting my time writing this.
4,Not particularly a romance!,"This wasn't a bad book but I didn't particularly care for it either. I've read about fifty of Ms Hill's books. This is the story of a household of children that are suddenly and unexpectantly orphaned. The oldest, a girl is almost of age and her brother is college age, then there are four (I think) younger siblings. The big bad relatives want to marry the oldest girl off and sent the rest to the country with a mean old aunt or boarding school soooooo they run away. This is a book of their adventures. The romance is about two pages at the end of the book, which was sudden and a bit much to swallow for me."
4,Highly recommended,"Humourous & funny, interesting mystery, light entertaiment, perfect for vacations."
2,"Fun to look at, but would you eat it?","If you like working with sugarpaste (fondant) and the people you bake for like eating it, this is a very nice book. My grandchildren and friends prefer good ol' American buttercream, thank you, so although I own this book and find it attractive, I will probably never actually make anything from it."
4,Great little book,"This book has cakes that are pretty simple to do if you have worked with fondant a few times.It has recipes for a few cakes and icing/glazes.It does have a picture of every cake & instructions.It has a variety of cakes to choose from,sports,christmas,ghost,valentine and all occasion cakes.A good one for your collection."
3,Fairy Costume,"I found this costume a little too much for my young teen. I thought it had leggins, but they were only thin tights.The wings, were stunning, but we had to take them off because people kept bumping into them."
5,A good troubleshooter,"I learned the hitch wiring is not so cut and dry. When I hooked up my new trailer, the trailer lights didn't work until I was on the road. But thanks to this tester, I knew that the wiring was working properly at the hitch. Make sure you have the proper grounding on your trailer."
3,"works, but not that useful","This unit works just as described -- it's LEDs light up when your turn signals, brakes, or lights are on. However, I only rate this 3 stars because although it works as advertised, it won't allow you to diagnose problems by yourself. In essence this is just a ""known to be working trailer"" so you can test your car's wiring. It still requires another person to test the brake light. You can test the other lights yourself but you are walking back and forth."
3,L&F review,"THe filming of the first show was not good but the story line was good. By the third show, the camera work was better. Several individuals viewed the film and all of us agreed that we want to see the second season."
1,Save your time and money,"Surprisingly, considering the author's reputation, this book is a waste of paper and ink. The cover promises interesting things, which never take place. A perfect example of why you should not choose a book by it's cover."
4,Just what I need to have fun,This tow line is strong enough for our needs and offers the option of increased length when needed. The brand assures me of consistent safety and security. Our kids will have lots of fun as a result
4,Great product for the price,"Received this very, very quickly. It did performed exactly as I wanted it to. It allowed my to pull some tubes behind a rented boat. I didn't need anything fancy for that. If you want a no-frills product at a good price, you've found it."
2,Not 7/16 inches,"I will admit I bought this rope for purposes other than water sports. However, the company should not lie about the thickness of the rope. The rope is barely 1/4 inch wide, and when compressed it is even thinner. In fact even doubling this rope over EIGHT times, it still does not reach a 1' diameter when compressed, and I therefore cannot hold on to it while dangling.On the plus side, it seems quite strong."
4,Great product with limits,"Purchased this tow rope at the same time I purchased the three person airhead. Broke the rope after about 5 hours of hard towing, easy retie and go but I would recommend a pulley because when towing two or three people the rope will wear very fast."
2,Already frayed,We've only used this twice and it is already fraying. It does what it says it will do - but it sure is disappointing to see the lifetime of the rope is likely to be a single season.
5,Works Great,This is being used to pull an inner tube behind a sea-doo. On several occasions the driver has snapped it hard from acceleration and it is still going strong. The length has also been perfect for what we needed it for.Fast shipment and great product.
3,Very interesting piece of its era,"Warners with its Archive Collection is giving us the oportunity to have access to many movies that a few years ago it would be literally impossible. Silent movies still are a very exotic product in the market, therefore it is very good news that we can enjoy things like ""The Flying Fleet"", not a masterpiece but a product of its time competently manufactured. George Hill directed exciting aerial scenes, in the ""Wings"" vogue and have a big star of those days Ramon Novarro and the blonde flapper Anita Page for the cast. Another plus for silent movies aficionados is that the soundtrack is the original music created and recorded in 1928 for the movie by MGM."
3,I would give...,"Under other circumstances I would like to give a minimum of 4 stars... but its like every Warner Brother Archive Collection a DVD-R, and no chapters.This is a late silent movie wie ""Ben Hur""-Hottie Ramon Novarro and also very attractive Ralph Graves. Anita Page (who was co-star in any of William Haines silent movies) is the girl between the two rivales in the US Flying Fleet which is telling their story from the Academy to their first big flight.Those ""Flying"" movies had been very popular at this time. When you like WW1 movies (but its not a WW1 in that sense), non-talkie comedies, men in Uniforms (Graves and Novarro looks very hot!) and interested in planes then you could like the movie.The Picture Quality isn't all the time in good condition but better than other DVD-products of other DVD-Label. We can be happy that this movie has survived in the archives. For me it was good enough to like this movie. Would love to see more movies with Ralph Graves."
1,Way Disappointed,"I've read Donna Kauffman books previously so I thought I'd add one more to my list...as I titled my review ""Way Disappointed"". The short stories of three of the ""boys"" were so sappy, slow & I truly didn't care if anyone ended up happily ever after. Hoping this was just a bad write. I would probably give her one more chance....but like the ole saying....1st time shame on them..2nd time shame on me......"
3,Cute stories; not-so-cute execution,"I did enjoy parts of these stories. They hit the ""I-want-something-short-and-sweet-and-not-too-complicated"" spot. The problem I had was this: I have often read that writers need to show rather than tell. I don't think I've ever seen a better (or worse?) illustration of that concept. So much of these stories takes place in the characters' heads. You get entire character histories and plots explained while a hero or heroine is, for example, looking out over a bluff thinking by him- or herself. It happens to a great degree in all three stories but more so in the first, the only one where the hero and heroine have a long history. I found myself skipping page after page while one or the other sat around thinking about their history and even setting up the premise for the remaining stories. It was a mite frustrating, especially since the stories are otherwise enjoyable."
2,What can you expect for $10?,"Tuning just shy of 1 full tone sharp with no adjustment possible. Voices crackly. Only 2-note polyphony. But considering the price, might be acceptable as a short-term starter instrument for a small child."
2,didn't last,"it sounded fine as a starter keyboard for a toddler, but even with very gentle handling, it just stopped working after a couple of weeks."
5,Amazing product,"This is an amazing product!!! It not only seals really well, but it also enhances and deepens the color of granite. A high end installer used this product on slab granite in my kitchen in 2006. This is in a room that I use constantly to prepare food. Not only did Enrich n Seal make the granite beautiful, but I have not touched the surface in over 5 years and it is still completely sealed (water place on the granite does not change the color). It is a pricey product, but the time that it saves you later makes it well worth the price!When I bought less expensive granite for two of my bathrooms this year, the product that the company used to seal the granite did not work at all. I bought Enrich n Seal and resealed the granite myself. It not only sealed the granite but made it look so much prettier and colorful!"
4,An Excellent Value,"This course is one of the few modern Chinese instructional guides available on the market today. The material seems to be up to date and easy to follow. Furthermore, the conversational sketches are interesting and lively. If there is a way to improve on the dialog offerings I would say that there should be more drill work. Some practice drills are offered in the "" Learn On The Go "" tapes. However, they require several playings to commit the phrases to memory. But this is only a small matter. In the final analysis though, I applaud Living Language for producing tapes and a study guide on Chinese, a language that few language companies are apparently willing to tackle. It is my hope that they will publish a more advanced course in the future."
1,My grandson is 15 & has an interest in languages.,"We thought this was CD's ,and we don't have a cassette player, and he thinks it is much more difficult then he had thought. We need to return this for a refund"
1,Save your money.,"If you happen to be 12 or just like to pretend you are, this is the perfect book for you. Following the premise that monkeys apprently bring inherent humour to the table, The Annotated Mantooth seems to've felt no need to be inventive beyond that, unless you think using an endless amount of swear words to make up for paper-thin writing is inventive. I suppose this book is a riot if you happen to be one of the people involved in its creation, but for anyone else, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Did not work,"Item did not work. Tried to charge two different Ipods with several different USB cords, just did not work. Bought this product specifically because it is ""Apple"" brand instead of buying a generic charger."
3,Did not receive authentic Apple adapter MA592LL/A,"I did not receive an authentic Apple adapter as described (MA592LL/A) in product description and I also did not receive the USB cable for connecting to my iPod, which was stated as being included! Product was shipped in a bubble wrap envelope - no box. The adapter I did receive doesn't provide a steady charge for my iPod Touch and has no Apple branding or identification whatsoever! Trying to contact seller ""Mac_Pro_Online"" to deal with the matter and will update this review accordingly.UPDATE: January 28, 2010I contacted the seller and they said it was an error on Amazon's comment notation of the product. They refunded me for my order. They also made note of the iPod Touch having issues with charging on this version however it will work with other models except for touch. Changed previous rating of 1 Star to 3 Stars. They dealt with my complaint in a timely manner and refunded me for my purchase."
4,ipod power adapter,"very pricey for an option that should come with every ipod. but aside from that, nice product. I like that at least it came with its own USB-iPOD cable (which means I now have 2.. one that came with the iPOD and one that came with the power adapter)"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FAKE APPLE RIP-OFF CHARGER,"DO NOT BUY THIS CHARGER!! IT IS NOT AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS; IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE USB CABLE AND IT IS A FAKE, IT DOES NOT COME IN THE APPLE AUTHENTIC PACKAGING!! THIS COMPANY IS TRYING TO RIP-OFF CUSTOMERS BY PRENTENDING IT COMES WITH A USB CABLE AND HOW IT IS AN AUTHENTIC APPLE PRODUCT BY SELLING IT FOR $30, THE PRICE OF A REAL ONE FROM APPLE'S WEBSITE WHEN IT IS ONLY WORTH 2-3 DOLLARS!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"
5,Product works well,The charger works well and is perfect for my ipod. It is very small so I can use it on my desk at work or at home and it doesn't take up a lot of counterspace. A great investment if your ipod requires frequent charging.
4,Does what it was intended to do.,"There is little to say except that it does what it was intended to do. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that I wish it was cheaper."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"This came with my ipod when I bought it. It's nice to have around to charge your ipod if you don't have a computer around. Just plug it in and it'll charge the ipod in a couple of hours, and you can listen while it charges. Does what it says it will.Having said that, I think it's kind of ridiculous that people are calling this a ""must have"". Obviously, it's not a must have, there's already a perfectly good way to charge your ipod. It's a handy thing to have around if you aren't always attached to your computer, and have an extra $30 that you don't have a better use for. If you are always going to have your computer with you when your ipod needs charging, then go spend your money on something else, because this gadget is pretty redundant."
2,not for long...,"i was super excited for these because i thought i was saving money but no, i just lost money instead. it's not like the chargers broke the day i got it or the next, but it didn't take long for it to break down. the plastic wrap surrounding the wire that was connected to both ends of the charger was coming off and at one point,it didn't even do anything so i just threw them both away. disappointing; i don't recommend it..."
1,did not work!,I plugged the charger into my ipod and it did not work at all! You should not buy this product!
1,Very Unhappy,"I didn't get aroung to opening this for a month... when I did, I realized it needed a USB cable which was NOT included even though the box said it was. Since I opened it beyond the return date, I'm stuck with it. To make matters worse, I bought this to replace one I already had (plug was breaking) so I tried to use the old cable which turns out to be firewire.When I reviewed the product description NO WHERE does it mention USB or Firewire. Very unhappy."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought from eForBay and had a horrible experience. not as described, I received it dirty and used, it rattled inside and does not work for ANY apple products. Does NOT work for iPhone (any generation), iTouch or iPod. I paid $8 for shipping for when it only took them less than $2 to ship. I returned it with a tracking number and it still got sent back to me even when I told them when they would be receiving it..It was a total waste of time and money for a product I cant even use.If you need a power adapter, DO NOT BUY FROM EFORBAY and just get a legit one from an actual retail store who won't jip you for $20 !Thank you."
2,Not Worth the price,"What costs $5 to make but sells for $30. Well this over priced peice of plastic from Apple. Apple is a greedy company. they make a profit of 75% on this. i'd say go for the alternative, bur if you want peace of mind ordering from offical 1st party Company like apple, then go ahead it's your money."
1,Cheaper alternatives available,"If you look around, you can find a simple, matter of fact USB power adapter for the price of a cup of coffee."
1,it didn't work,"I have no idea why but when I tried to charge my new 30GB video iPod with this charger, it didn't work at all. So I don't know if mine was just flawed or it could be more."
5,Power adapter,Product works well. I can just plug it in and not have to use the computer ports just a regular outlet. My ipod wouldn't charge completely unless I was using my computer. My computer goes into a sleep mode and with this adapter I never have to worry about incomplete charges. Came in handy during my vacation trip when i didn't have computer access.
4,Charging,I'm happy with this product. It charges my iPod quickly and the cord that came with it was a lifesaver since I was given my iPod without the factory accessories. Just the cord was more than half the price of the charger and I'm glad that I went this route. I wouldn't use a knockoff. At the cost of replacement for an iPod it's worth a few bucks to keep from hurting something.
2,Cord legnth is WAAAAY too short for the money,I think you could do better with another adapter. The cord is waaaay too short for the amount of money you'll pay for it. With the very high price Apple charges for this adapter- they really could have been a little more generous with the legnth. I'm very disappointed. Save your money and buy a generic brand.
5,Pricey But Worth It!,"I have an iPod Shuffle and this charger works like a dream, it's great not to be tied to my computer.It's fast, compact, light weight, and does exactly what it's supposed to.I do wish Apple would include it with the Shuffle or its other iPods, however the nice thing about it is when I upgrade it will work with the new iPod.True you can find much cheaper chargers but I'd rather spend the extra money for piece of mind, I don't want my Shuffle fried."
1,Way overpriced,$7.99 for the same genuine Apple product or 99 for a knock off at your favorite online auction source.
5,Ipods Apple USB Power Adapter,"Bulky but very well made, performed well, dependable. I recommend getting the Apple over other brand chargers for your ipod."
5,Great Gadget,This is a great concept. I was tired of having to turn on the computer just to charge the iPOD. This product allows user to plug the USB cord from the iPOD into it and plug the adapter into the wall outlet. It is especially nice for charging an iPOD while traveling- when a computer is not convenient.
2,Not a good value,I assumed that this charger would recharge my iPod faster than the usb connection on my computer.But it doesn't and it's to expensive. I have seen third party chargers for much less.
5,Great Move,I was a great move purchasing this adapter. You just plug in and go. You don't have to mess with your computer or making sure it doesn't go into sleep mode.
5,iPod adapter,This is great. I just keep my iPod plugged in when I'm at home and I don't waste the battery.
4,iPod USB Powe Adapter,"es un accesorio muy útil, pero debería ser incluido en la compra del ipod así como sucede cuando compras un celular."
3,"Nice product, but expensive for what it does","I bought two 8GB ipod nanos around christmas, one for me, one for my girlfriend. I didnt want to have her or me having to leave the ipod connected to the computer so I bought two of these from Amazon. The product does just what it is meant to but it wasnt included with the darn iPod. I know its just another way for Apple to milk more money from the worlds most popular MP3 player, but COME ON!!! The only saving grace is that it comes with its on sync cable that you can leave connected to the power adapter so you dont have to use the one that came with your ipod. You can atleast keep it near your computer."
5,Ipod Charger,Great item to have especially if you are traveling. Charges in about 2 hours and I don't have to take my computer around. Love It
4,Good purchase,I was glad to find this so my daughter had this option to charge her ipod. It's come in very handy!
2,"Cords work, Plugs do not","These I-pod cords have some issue with the wall connector assembly. The cords work just fine with my other wall connectors, but do not work with the wall connector that came with them. So if you are trying to purchase this to use in a 110V wall socket I would look for something else. If you just need the cable portion and think the price is right then they are fine."
4,The era of my mothers....,"The fifties and sixties have always been an inspiring time that I love studying. My parents grew up and struggled through this era. Many movies and books have been made about this era but Breines really brings new light to girls and women's lives during this period. Aspects of life that we take for granted these days (such as the increase of music group created solely for the young teen audience) have originated during this time. The same girls who cooed over the Beatles became the feminists of the sixties where they rebelled against the system. Breines examines the aspects of women struggled within this culture and the conflicts they encountered. Dealing with the ideology of domesticity and longing for the freedoms of education and sexual choice. It is a wonderful glance into how women idealized the ""superwoman"" concept they still suffer with today. An excellent read for anyone interested in the origin of the second wave of feminism or the fifties and sixties in general."
5,Australian Tea Tree Oil First Aid Handbook,This book is a MUST have. Good index provided for various health conditions and defined for everyone to understand. Book is compact and easy to use from an amateur to a professional health care giver.
5,A Good Reference To Have,This book demonstrates how versatile tea tree oil is. There are uses that I never imagined listed here. The best part is that the book offers recipes (ie. how many drops of tea tree oil to use) in a straightforward manner that is easy to look up.
2,Ehhhhh....I read the whole thing in 15 min or less.,I am not particularly a fast reader and read the whole book cover to cover in 15 min or less. The info is very basic with absolutely no details. I already knew all I read but with more detail by researching Australian Tea Tree Oil online. It was a disappointing purchase. This item should sell at the Supermarket check out for about 2.99 at most. Still not worth the read with the exception of being for those who do not use the internet for research.
2,Simplistic,"This book is a very brief synopsis of some of the uses for tea tree oil. It is written in easy to understand language, and there is not much detail.A good starting point for those new to this product, but there are much more comprehensive resources out there."
3,Pure Invention,"This book is really a booklet, soft cover - an interview and photographs by Jan Groover. However the book came from Anybooks through Amazon and for the initial cost of $182 I expected a much more comprehensive book. I still can't believe the price!!!! Will continue to order through Amazon as I have had good service in the past but will be very wary of anything in this sort of price range. No-one has offered any explanation of the price - Is it a particularly rare book? Could someone help me to understand whY I was charged so much."
5,Sony BCG- 34HRMF Charger.,I bought this charger for all the rechargeable batteries I have. And The charger performs all of the information fight in front for me to see. I have used it several times and I know I can depend on it to protect may batteries and I get the best possible charging that I need. Great going Sony you have a great product.
2,VERY BAD BATTERIES,"The charger is great. Featuring a refresh cycle and a LCD display for each battery. However, the SONY 2700 batteries supplied with the charger ARE NO GOOD...They lose their charge in a couple days if not used and only supply a very few shots....I bought POWEREX AA 2700s and they stay fully charged for over a week if not used and last a long time when using them. I do love this charger...But as for the Sony Batteries...I SCRAPPED THEM!"
5,Really long lasting batt,"Great on a Canon A640, can fill up 4 gb of photos before showing low batt warning, simply excellent batteries. Make sure you use a Sony charger to make sure you have a long life cycle for these batts."
1,Batteries self discharge in 84 hours,"After I purchased the charger and batteries, I charged the batteries, put them in a Canon Powershot A590IS camera. I few days later, I went to use the camera, and the batteries were discharged. I recharged them using the refresh mode. Measured voltage was 1.38 vdc. After 72 hours, with no use, the voltage dropped to 1.21 vdc, and after 84 hours, to 1.18 vdc. At that point, the camera wouldn't even turn on. I think the charger is fine, but the batteries are worthless. I sent an email to Sony describing my experience, but Sony has not replied.I've ordered a set of Sanyo Eneloop batteries, which I expect will perform much better, according to reviews I've read. I would not recommend the Sony 2700mAh NiMH batteries due to the extremely rapid self discharge."
1,Something is wrong with this charger or with the batteries,"The batteries dont last as they say, 2.700amper dont work at all.Not recomended this one, im a Sony fan and this dont work. To bad for my money to bad for Sony.********January 2007 update.I got one previuos with 2.300mHa batteries and they are dead since 4 months ago."
1,A good charger with really bad included batteries,"Good charger but the included batteries are complete and utter garbage. They don't hold charge even when not used. Duracell and Energizer work great. I got this charger August 5, 2006."
4,good one,i am using this batteries in my Sony Cybershot Digital camera.it works really good.i like this product.
4,Pleased,"I'm pretty happy with the Sony charger. I'm not a professional with this sort of thing but I like it. It does what it's supposed to do and it's compact enough to travel with. The batteries last pretty long, I was surprised. I have a SX110IS Canon and they were work well with it. Went on vacation and took a couple hundred pics and towards the end of those pics I changed the batteries to fresh ones simply because the warning came on...they'd have gone a bit longer. Small and inexpensive charger that does the job."
3,High Speed battery charging????,"IF you are looking for a fast charger, this is not it!! It is not nearly as fast as it could be. That being said, the really nice feature of this charger is the refresh cycle that takes your old rechargables to zero and then automatically brings them up to a like new charge state. I restored several of my older batteries that would no longer reach a full charge & it did a great job on them.Summary: Not fast, great at rejuvenating your old rechargables"
3,The charger is nice but the batteries are not,"I liked the charger but didn't get to use it very long because the batteries quit working. One battery even gave off a plume of gas when it died inflating my flashlight's on/off button like a balloon. These aren't the only Sony rechargeable batteries I've used. The others failed too, just not as dramatically. I don't get many discharge/recharge cycles out of them before they refuse to hold any charge. They also go dead sitting on the shelf after about a week and a half. I switched to Eneloop batteries and they are much better. I also recommend a charger that allows you to set a low recharge rate. Quick chargers heat up the batteries and shorten their life."
1,Batteries woudln't hold charge,"This thing was terrible. I thought it would be a ""smart"" charger. But it was smart as ruining batteries. The Sony brand batteries I bought with it wouldn't hold a charge for nothing. I tried different brand batteries too and it didn't work very well either. I finally just ended up throwing this thing away. The ""refresh"" feature was more of a gimmick. I finally just bought an Energizer charger instead."
2,Bad batteries or bad charger?,"Like other reviewers, I've had problems with the batteries that came with this charger. After less than six months and (probably three uses for each battery) the batteries failed. The indicator on the charger began flashing quickly indicating failed batteries and the batteries wouldn't power up any of my devices. Unfortunately, I can't tell if the batteries are the cause or the charger is the cause. My only viable option is to try a different brand of battery to see if the same thing happens."
5,Very Solid Charger,"Had this item for about 5 months and have already done about 20 charges of varies rechargeable batteries, both AA and AAA. Works really well and I love the discharge function of this item. Looks and feels solid and there is very little heat build up while the batteries are being charged. Would definitely go in for the same product if, I hope not or at least for a little longer, this charger fails. Also, the batteries that are provided last a long time once charged fully. I use them for my Garmin eTrex Vista Hcx GPS."
4,Quality,"Great charger, I feel best in the market. Really like the LCD display of the charging status of each individual battery. Advertising it as ""super fast"" isn't correct, as it will take hours to charge fully discharged batteries."
2,Batteries need to get a life!,"Charging time is good, but the shelf life of the batteries leaves something to be desired. I have some generic recharghables that sit on the shelf after charging for up to six weeks and when putting those in the unit it shows a full charge. The Sony batteries are dead. This is not good if you are planning on traveling without the charger which is made difficult with the long cord on the unit. It might have cost a few dollars more but I should have bought a plug-in charger (no cord) and batteries at a local home improvement store."
5,Nice rechargable battery kit.,"There are several types of rechargable battery sets out there. I didn't realize this when I started looking. You want to watch for the packs that recharge based on just time. These can overcharge your batteries and lead to a shorter battery life. The Sony kit uses a smart charger that senses how much charge is left in the batteries and only charges them to full, leading to a longer battery life over time. Great price and easy to use as well. Can't go wrong with this set."
2,Bad batteries,"I believe I received faulty batteries with this charger. Would charge them, leave for one day and my camera would not even power up. Tried several times to recharge and ended up throwing them into the garbage can."
4,"Sony good, Eveready bad.","Bought this a few months ago for use with my Panasonic oral irragator after buying Eveready at HD. Had no idea how unhappy I was with Eveready batteries until I used the Sony.I bought extra Eveready batteries so that I would always have some charged up and ready to go, but the Evereadies were ""Neveready!""They were a total waste. They don't hold a charge. It doesn't matter if you are using them or if you are storing them for (immediate) future use.Sony has Eveready beat hands down.The Sony batteries seem to last as long as alkalines. No, I have not really checked, but I think this is a fair assessment.The charger is inconvenient. I really do not like the cord. It is difficult to find a decent space on my small bathroom counter top for the charger and the cord. I wound up putting it on top of a box fan I keep in the hallway, which I sometimes bump into.I guess I should have bought the other Sony charger."
1,A ripoff,I bought this charger and batteries to use in my Nikon strobe. After 2 months the batteries would no longer hold a charge. The charging process seemed to take FOREVER!! Almost 6 hours to charge 4 batteries. I tried the discharge feature to no avail. I tossed the charger and the batteries since I could no longer return them under Amazon's return policy. I'm back to using reliable alkaline batteries. I'd stay away from these if I were you.
3,Slightly Picky Charger,"IMHO, This charger is a little too picky when it decides that cells are no longer suitable for re-charging. I does a fine job on new cells, but I am glad that I have an older Maha charger that is a bit less ""critical"" and will still recharge useful cells that are several years old. The Sony Nimh cells included appear to be no longer made in Japan.Update...I have also noticed a very high self discharge on the cells that came with the charger... I put them in a radio last weekend and played it for a few hours and this weekend when I turned it on the cells were almost dead :( The two year old ""made in Japan"" Sony cells that I still use have lost some capacity, but still perform better than these!I just ordered more Eneloops... no more Sony cells for me!SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries"
2,Charger good batteries NOT,The charger rates a 4star (except it is slow). The batteries rate a 1 they are lousy wont hold a charge more than a day or two (in the case) in electronics they are even worse. I also bought POWEREX batteries they work well. I would never buy the Sony batteries
2,Didnt expect this bad from Sony,"My charged batteries are discharged pretty fast. I put them in my digicam, and if I dont use for just 3 days, they are discharged. This is not expected. My money got wasted :("
2,good charger lousy batteries,"Charger works well for all batteries I've tried. Like the feature where you can completely discharge your batteries before re charging. The 4 Sony batteries that came with it are crap, don't even hold their charge over night!! Bought a Sony camera 8 years ago and the Sony rechargable batteries that came with the camera still work. It's just the recent Sony batteries I'm downgrading."
5,It's a very good product,"This product is very convenient, fast and efficient.I'm loving it, especially with the presentation of each battery charge."
4,Great charger from Sony,"This is a great charger from Sony for charging AA and AAA rechargeable batteries. The case is made of sturdy plastic with a readout screen on the front that displays the charge status of the batteries placed in the charger. The top part of the charger opens up to reveal four charging bays which can take either AA or AAA batteries. I don't think it would be a good idea to charge AA and AAA batteries at the same time (i.e. in parallel) even though it might seem like a quick way to charge those two kinds of batteries.As far as charging speed goes, this charger does a decent job at 4 hours. As some other reviewer has noted here, it cannot be considered super quick by any standards but it works for me. I normally leave it charging my four batteries all night and voila, by morning they are fully charged and ready to use! I'd recommend this charger anytime."
4,excellent,"The charger is very good, but the problem is that the batteries do not retain their charge if kept idle. can someone help me to get a longer life for the charged battery.Vishu Kashyap, San Jose"
3,Dying a slow death after 10 months,"When I first got this, I really liked it. It came with the 2700 MAh batteries rather than the 2500 which are more common. They are a little harder to find, but the additional life is nice.I use the batteries mostly in my Nikon Speedlight and as an auxiliary power supply for my Nikon D80 camera. The lifetime of the batteries is phenomenal, more than double and alkaline battery life.I especially liked the ""Refresh"" feature which completely discharges then recharges, extending the life of batteries.The slow recharge time can be inconvenient, but I make up for this by having a few additional batteries on hand.However, after about 10 months of intermittent use, the left two compartments seem to stop charging. The little LCD battery symbols doe not appear, but the screen does light up when batteries are inserted. I am not certain if they are being charged or not. Oh well."
1,Do not buy,"Whenever I charged my cells in this charger, they would get extremely hot towards the end of the charge cycle. I know now that this extreme heat was killing my batteries. I had two sets of cells die on me within the first year after using this charger.NiMH cells are great for connivence and saving money, but if you buy this charger it will kill your cells early!I have since changed to a different charger and have not had any of my cells die since."
1,Waste of money,"I read the product reviews before buying this and thought it would be nice to use for our Wii system instead of countless alkaline batteries. It turned out to be a waste of time. The batteries take a few hours to charge and that's OK. But when they only have a working charge of just 5 minutes in a Wii remote, they cause more harm by interrupting the game with 'lost communication' failures. Even when executing the looonnnnggg 'refresh' charge cycle, the batteries fared no better. The charger says the batteries are fully charged when I take them out, but they don't have the right stuff for practical use.I can't recommend this product and suggest you look elsewhere for a rechargeable solution."
3,good charger for ground,"I bought this charger for canon power shot camera. It charges in long time but charges sufficient for my camera and also display and status on CRT is good thing. Also charger is light weighted and attractive but I faced one problem after traveling, the chargeable cells discharges after check in scan at airport and I was unable to use the chargeable cells after traveling but for ground travel its good product to buy."
3,SONY BCG-34HRMF4 Charger,"It took longer than expected to fully charge the batteries.But did like the ""charging status display"" and compact size of the charger."
2,Batteries suck,"The sony batteries in this pack are really bad. After recharged, they can only stand for few days even without using."
3,Not a quick charger,"The charger is pretty good in appearance and LCD to show the statue of charging, but the charger time is a little bit long."
4,Nice recharger,"I have one of these rechargers. It's very well built, has a clean desing. It's a Sony. A nice feature is it's LCD screen. You can follow the refreshing or recharging process for each battery (up to 4). It has some sort of probe that avoid over heating batteries. The only one thing I did not like is it's manual. It's not clear on explaining how recharger shows when a battery is fully charged. It says it turns off, but I tried and recharged several batteries but the lcd never came off, even thoug the temperature of batteries became cool, meaning (at least I guess so) they are not being recharged any more. If anyone could inform how to discover when the batteries are fully charged, please inform me."
3,Potentially damaging batteries,"I purchased this charger about a year ago. Besides the four batteries coming with it, I also used it to charge other NiMh batteries I have. The batteries get VERY VERY HOT during charging period. And I also found after switching to this charger, I have a lot more batteries died than when I was using the slow overnight charger. I can't prove it is because of the charger, but I highly suspect that the charging cut-off mechanism was not design good enough to work with batteries other than SONY's, so batteris get overcharged each time, and died soon after. Be aware."
3,Nothing Super Quick about it,Batteries last well..but there is nothing super quick about this charger at all. Takes 6-7 hours for a set of 4 batteries. My previous experience with duracell was much better. It used to charge within 1 hour. And battery life was also good. Just that this one came with a worldwide voltage made me buy this
4,Charges fine,"One of the hinges of the top has broken a bit, so the top doesn't always stay on anymore, but it still charges my batteries fine."
1,not what expected,"-the lcd screen shows you the charging rate.... but it must be inaccurate for, I will have a battery charge overnight, take it out and not use it right away. a few days later it will be at 0% without even using it? b/c when I try to use it, it won't work, so it will have me charge it all over again. so now i just leave it in the charger until use, but even after it shows it's been fully charged I will use the batteries, and they won't be at 100% I really don't get it. If anyone could help me understand why this is not working properly that would be great. With the little battery life I do get out of it, they seem to work fine, just seems i have to charge them a lot more often compared to my cheap old battery charger I had. Figured I'd spend the money on this, since sony is usually a good product.... i don't know."
2,Disappointment,Very disappointed in the overall performance. It could be the batteries rather than the charger. They do not hold a charge very well.Took 2 heavy duty batteries in a comparison test and I found that they lasted longer than my Sony batteries (fully charged). Sure it saves on the cost of replacing batteries but it is sad when I need to carry the extra set of 2 along as I know my device will need them before too long.
3,Not exactly a fast charger,"Be carefull! this charger is not a fast charger. I have an Enegizer 15 min-chager and it works better, if you are looking for speed. Anyway the Sony charger is a good one if need just a bettery charger."
2,"Charger OK, batteries NOT","I have to agree with others, these batteries will only hold a charge approx. 48 hrs. That's if they are not even in the camera. I tried refreshing, no help. I don't know if the charger is bad or I got a bad set of batteries. I think Sony should look into this as this seems to be a common problem."
3,Charger works; batteries stink!,"This was my first experience with rechargeable ""everyday"" batteries, and I was very surprised and disappointed with the lack of battery life in the Sony batteries. I put them into my tv remotes and they lasted about one day before I had to recharge them. After a few frustrating rounds of this, I gave up and bought disposable batteries for my remotes. Since then, I have purchased some Energizer batteries, but I haven't used them yet because I still have fresh disposable batteries in the devices. Hopefully they will last much longer than the Sonys."
3,Charger for Batteries you can only get in this kit,"We have been happy with this product. I just wish we could buy additional sony batteries with the same AA typ 2700mAh NI-MH. I have only seen them in this kit and wish that amazon had the solo 4 packs available. Do you mix types. Not me, replacement money does not grow on trees."
5,Very satisfied with this Sony battery charger,"This charger is nicely designed (esthetically) and the build feels solid. Though, the lid hinge seems a bit fragile. The display lights up when the unit is working and turns off when done. But what I like most is that this charger charges the each battery individually and not in pairs like other chargers.I wish Sony bundled this charger with LSD (Low Self Discharge) cells instead of the regular NiMH cells. I will be using Eneloops with this charger anyways."
5,Leave it to Sony,"I have only used the charger a few times but it fully charges the batteries, even when they have memory loss, thanks to the Sony's Refresh option. It does not charge with lightning speed, despite claims, but that is a good thing. Batteries charged too quickly burn out quicker. It is true of car, motorcycle and almost every kind of battery so I believe it applies to Ni-MH as well. Good product."
5,Excellent,"I liked the charger very much its sleek definitely compact, Since I have a lot of places to travel I was looking for a compact charger and without an atatched plug since in every country we have a different plug.Futher I found it easy to use just put the batteried and atatche the cord to power, furthe the auto shut feature is nice henc eu can keep the batteries in the night for charging.All in all I give it a 5 star rating, since its quite meeting my expectation."
1,just name is superquick charger its actually not superquick,"takes long time to charge. its not super quick charger at all, as name implies. Dont be fooled by title of product. i got fooled, but after purchasing the product, couldnt do anything."
1,terrible design,"Yes, as others say, the batteries that come with this are trash, don't even waste your time with them.The charger design is ridiculous. From the manual:""The batteries must be inserted before the charger is plugged into the outlet.""In other words, every time you want to use this, you have to unplug it and plug it back in. Nice touch!"
3,"Great charger, lousy batteries","While the charger itself is fine, the 2700mah batteries are a nuisance in that they completey discharge when idle for only a few days. Unless you use your camera every day and always return the batteries to the charger at night, it's easy to get caught with dead batteries. Even sitting in the charger for a couple of days after they are done charging, you'll have dead batteries.For example, on Tuesday I took about 20 pictures, put the camera (Canon S3-IS) back in the case, thinking the batteries were hardly used at all. On Friday, I turned on the camera and it promptly told me to replace the batteries and shut off."
1,"Charger ok, batteries not","The title says it all. Batteries drop the charge after a few days regardless of use. Older Eveready rechargables stay charged (with same charger) for many weeks. I won't trash the charger, but the batteries are useless for my camera application."
1,Batteries provided only charge in my -other- NiMH charger!,"The provided batteries would not charge in this charger! This is similar to those who said the batteries were no good that came with this charger. However, I found charging them in a -different- charger provided a good charge. So, I'd conclude that the battery is NOT compatible with the charger. The charger, otherwise seemed to charge most of my batteries. In the manual it lists specific maH capacities that it works with. So make sure your existing batteries are these sizes at least. Fortunately I have a charger that DOES charge the provided AA batteries. I don't understand why people keep rating this product one star about the batteries, yet Amazon or Sony makes no attempt to correct this issue. I guess it's because people like me keep buying it."
1,Batteries Worthless!,"2700 mAh Ni-MH batteries sounded great, but my old 1600 mAh batteries last 10 times as long. At full charge, these batteries fail after 5-10 photos in my Canon A710IS camera. I've charged these batteries one day and found them completely dead the next. To be fair, the charger is great! It has 4 independent intelligent charging circuits, so you can charge 1-4 batteries in different states of charge. Each battery will come to full charge and stop charging. The refresh feature will restore many 'dead' batteries to some degree of usefullness. Great charger, but you will have to buy or own different batteries."
2,OK fast charger but doesn't charge the batteries to full potential,Nice charger and it works fast but I recommend that you use a Maha PowerEx charger to get the best out of Sony BatteriesMaha PowerEx MH-C204W4AA27 - Battery charger - battery - rechargeable - AA x 4 - 2700 mAh. I can get hundreds of photos when Sony batteries go thru a Maha but only about 150 with the Sony charger. The Sony charger also rejects batteries that the Maha can charge. But the Sony is much faster for what that's worth.
1,sloooooow charge and won't hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time,"I'm very disappointed with this purchase. The charger is incredibly slow, only usable for overnight charging, and the batteries won't hold a charge for any decent length of time. If I put freshly charged batteries in my camera, I can take a good number of pictures, but if I leave the batteries idle for any length of time, say a week, they're dead the next time I want to use them."
3,Need lot of time for charging,Pros:Shows the charge remaining in the batteryInterface is user firnedlyCons:Takes lot of time to charge the battery
4,Great product but could be more faster,"The best part i like abt this product is batteries, they are 2700 mAh, once charged the batteries last for > 1.5 days and abt 200 pictures. other features such as LCD screen and refresh functions are great.The down sides are, no car carger available for this product and it takes 3.5-4 hrs to completely charge 2-4 batteries."
4,Sony BCG-34HRMF4,"I use the batteries for my digital camera (Canon Powershot S2 IS). They never last long, but I think that's because the camera needs a lot of energy. It takes about 6 hours to fully charge the batteries. And the displey is fine, the ""refresh"" button is usefull... I'm not sorry for bying it."
5,great charger,the charger works geeat here in the states as well as overseas---it was a great buy--- allowing you to see the battery charge amount made it worth the price--
2,batteries won't hold a charge,"I have never had a product from Sony that wasn't wonderful until this. I have fully charged both sets of batteries numerous times and they won't hold a charge. Every time I go to use my Sony digital camera the batteries are dead. So I try the extra set and they are also dead. I charge them again, install them in the camera and store it for later use. I've repeated this 5 or 6 times since July 1st and I give up."
1,it was awful.,"it was awful. For some reason, the batteries run out extremely fast. I only charged it and didn't use it for several days, and the next time it won't even turn on the camera! I may have been unlucky, but I was really disappointed!"
4,Sony Battery Charger and AA NiMH batteries,This charger works well. Refresh feature and LCD are both handy. Power cord is bulky. Older model Sony charger has a swing out plug built in and does not need a cord. 2700 mAh batteries have long life in Canon PS SX10 camera.
1,"Charger Good, Batteries Are Worthless",The Sony AA 2700 mAh batteries that ship with this charger are worthless. They self-discharge in a day or two. Try purchasing the eneloop batteriesSANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesor their equivalent to use with the charger. The charger works well. Each cell is charged separately so you can mix and match the cells in the charger. Also it has a Refresh mode in which the cells are discharged completely before they are recharged. That feature is supposed to help maintain the capacity of the cells as they age.
1,*Extremely* Poor Charge Lifetime,"I purchased the older model of Sony charger and 4 2500 AA batteries. Then I purchased this unit and 8 more batteries. My plan was to use 4 and keep 4-8 charged ""on standby"" at all times, swapping them out as I needed them.The Sony rechargeable batteries suck too much to support my plan. After a full charge, even a full refresh/charge, if I leave them in the drawer for 2 days they will run out of power and I need to charge them again. And they seem to power my devices for less time than alkaline (non disposable) batteries as well.If I knew what brand to get instead, I would throw these away and buy them. But the Sony rechargeable batteries have made me distrust NiMH rechargeables altogether. This is not a premium quality product, definitely not worth the Sony name."
3,super quick charger,"This is no where near super quick.The only reason I wanted a third charger was because the time it takes to charge the batteries.The description here mentions no word about how long it actually takes to charge, and one of reviewers told me it took about 30 to 60 minutes to charge.I was only to find that it takes 230 minutes to charge the 2300 batteries come with the charger after I bought it, and the actual testing confirmed that number. 230 minutes, that's ~4 hours, which means over night charging, NOT acceptable.The LCD and REFRESH features are nice, but I am not paying $30 for those 2 features.Another thing that bothers me, it has a really long cord, similar to Laptop cords, the cord plugs into the wall and charger, instead of the built-in plug found in most other charges, this would become annoying when travelling.If you don't mind the 4 hour charging time (no where near super quick for May,2005 standards), it is a great charger."
3,Batteries can't hold their own,"I bought this to accompany my new Canon Flash unit. It's a nice well built charger.I would have preferred a wall mount option though since my studio has very limited desk space.The refresh button is great, really essential for ni-mh batteries. The ""charging"" indicators are a nice touch too. I read the Amazon reviews and hoped my batteries would be the exception but as others had warned the batteries are unable to hold their charge for more than a day or two. Don't depend on them to work when you need them. I charged the Sony batteries for several hours and shot maybe 50-60 shots with no problem. Next day they were dead. thought maybe I'd done something wrong. After giving them two more identical chances to prove themselves worthy ,they failed exactly the same way. Do yourself a favor and get some Sanyo eneloops and recycle the Sony batteries like I did."
1,Batteries charge getting down often,"I read the positive comments and reviews of this product and took a bold step to buy this latest Product. The batteries are real useless so to say they completey discharge when idle for only a few days. The battery requires to be charged a few minutes before every single use of it which is impossible in my case. Even if the batter is idle for a couple of days after they are done charging, you will see it dead. Ultimately I am not make use of this battery. Not sure if its the battery problem or the charger problem. Really frustrated and disappointed of this product."
2,Sony BCG-34HRMD4 - not so worldwide,"This was a great charger, came with 2300 mAh batteries. Went to Vietnam and after almost a week of using the batteries(over 600 pic), I decided to take a chance and recharge. It did it great, but the charger no longer works. Batteries charged fine in the U.S. using a friends charger. But the unit is no longer any good. Maybe not so worldwide OR couldn't take the travel."
1,super quick my a**,super quick charger can take 320 mins to charge four batteries. very dissapointed with product. avoid it
1,Poor Charger and Poor Batteries,"I purchased this charger+batteries in US and started using this in India. It was working till 6 months before. 6 months back it started giving trouble. When I use this in my Canon SX10 camera, I am able to take only 2 to 3 photo shots and it asks to change the batteires. But when I use Sanyo eneloop batteries, it works fine.The charger also started giving problem. It stopped functioning 6 months back. No display and no charging of the battery. I took to Sony service center. They said this charger cannot be serviced and a new charger has to be purchased.Totaly I am dissatisfied with this product."
2,Dead batteries,"OK, I didn't buy this device for the batteries, but for to have a highly functional and relatively small charger for my collection of NiMH's and Hybrid batteries when I travel, which I do a great deal.As a charger it is fine. The long cord makes it a bit much for traveling and so I trimmed it back. Mistakenly, I thought it would plug directly into an outlet. My problem. This said it does refresh batteries, and seems to do so effectively and quickly.That's the good news. The bad is that the Sony NiMH's that came with the charger are el stinko. Don't hold a charge and are only good for an environmentally friendly circular file. Feels like they are simply dumping relatively old and low capacity ones. Bad practice. My relatively low review is therefore based on that fact. When I buy a package I want the whole thing to work. Caveat Emptor."
2,"Ok charger, horrid batteries","I got this set about 6 months ago and after the first month these batteries have stayed in a drawer...only because I'm not sure where to recycle them. The 2700mAh capacity sounds great. However, they lose charge SO fast that if I charge them the day before, by the next day they're already half gone. It's absurd. Do NOT get these batteries. They will let you down when you need them.That being said, the charger is fine. It charges both my Sony batteries (crap) and my Energizer ones (workin great).Were I to do it again, I would not get this set. Go get some Eneloops or Energizers. Leave the Sony batteries for someone else.Dave"
1,Never charging?,"I bought one of these, and the batteries _never_ did charge. The meter on the front of the charger unit shows full, but if I remove the batteries out and put them in the next second, they start charging freshly (note: The mode of the charger is on ""charge"", not ""recycle"". I actually had the patience to get it (charger + batteries) replaced by Sony, and the replacement has the same problem.This is extremely odd since I wouldn't expect 2 fresh pieces to have the same problem."
1,3 day charge,"I was excited to get these batteries, because I had a set of old sony batteries that lasted me 5 years with consistent power.I got these batteries in the mail and immediately charged them and went outside and took a couple of pictures. I then put my camera away, and a week later I went to take some shots, and the camera wouldn't turn on. I thought maybe my camera drained them, but when I put in the replacements, they were dead too.This happened multiple times, with the length the batteries worked lasting between 3 and 5 days. That is completely unacceptable in my opinion.I would highly recommend getting ""Pre-charged"" Rechargeable batteries, because their shelf life while not being used is much longer."
2,Stopped working,"I loved this charger until a week ago when the two left charging stations stopped working. Now I can only charge two batteries at a time rather than 4. Otherwise I love this charger and the batteries. This may be a flaw with my model than with the charger overall since most people seem to love it, but it is something to keep in mind when making a purchase."
5,Fantastic Charger,"Got this charger because I'm tired of buying aa batteries. It works like a charm. I like the fact thatit has the refresh option, so you can totally drain the batteries, then recharge them. Takes a little longer, but you know they are all charged at the same level. I would buy another one."
3,Not Antje Duvekot,"I don't know if it is just happenstance or by design that this artist is grouped with Antje Duvekot and her CD's above under the ""Customers who bought this item also bought...."", but potential buyers should know that this artist IS NOT Antje Duvekot. Antje Duvekot is one of the most talented new singer-songwriters on the American folk scene today. THIS Antje is Antje Zumbansen. I'm sure Ms. Zumbansen is a gifted artist in her own right but buyers should know for certain that they are two different artists."
5,Glamire Bras,"Not very many company make A Cup very often any so hard tyo find, Wear and tear is long lasting."
1,Cheap/flimsy Controller,Do yourself a favor when searching for an aftermarket controller: avoid this one. I bought this remote having bought Mad Catz remotes in the past for my XBox. This remote is utter garbage. It broke in less than 1 month of minimal use. The batteries would not stay in contact causing the remote to shut off & lose signal in the middle of game play. The battery door also eventually completely broke off. The remote itself is somewhat comfortable to hold (during the short time it works) but you get the overall feeling that is isn't made very well.
2,Brookstone Foam 'n Spray Wash Nozzle,"Nice product but greatly overpriced at over $35.00. I found the identical item, without the Brookstone label, for $9.95 at Lowes."
2,Size Matters!!!!!! Dinky headed bounty hunter!!!,"Listen here if you are looking for a cool version of Boba Fett from this series. Then get theBoba fett figure that talks!!! This Boba in this listing has a shrunken head ,and will firstmake you laugh then it will make you cry then you'll want to write a review. So do yourselfa favor and get the much improved talking Boba fett ,because the head is far more in propotion toits body & it still comes with the cool armor, back pack and looks like the 1:1 scale versionbut miniaturized...this also goes to Darth Vader. Get the vader with the sound effects and removablereveal helmet..again another realistic looking figure. If scaled up they both would make awesome 1:1full scale figures. Freaky to own something so detailed with leather and canvas suits...great products...the only thing cool with the shrunken headed versions of Darth and Boba is the cool box with the characterspictured real big in the front!!! So if doesn't talk then tell it to take a walk!!!!!"
1,"Sorry auther, I feel ripped off!","OK I never write reviews. I am way to busy but this book. Growl,[........] Ok, the book is 150ish pages. The first 45 pages are the book, and contain information about major tours. Huge tours. That is great but nothing under that, and if your doing major tours, you know this stuff. The other 100 or so pages is just appendix. Yes!!! 100 pages of appendix which means 2/3rds of the book!!! It is full of examples of contracts etc. very nice to have, but common on, a 2/3 ratio? So basically he wrote about 45 pages of the book and filled the rest with contracts he had lying around being in the business. And the book is some were like, 45 bucks or so. Seriously. I paid a buck a page. I am NOT a cheap guy. [........] A 45 dollar book should be huge. I feel ripped off!!!. Sorry Mr, Vasey. I do. I just hope I can keep someone else from getting taken."
1,"No padding, ripped in one day","I am very unhappy with this product. I used the gloves yesterday for the first time, and noted that palm wasn't very padded. These are simply gloves, and provide no support for lifting weights.Also, as I removed the gloves after the first use, I noticed a tear along the seam. I am returning these immediately.I don't recommend these gloves."
1,Useless,"These gloves ended up hurting more than they helped. I took them off after twenty minutes. They offerred virtually no support when lifting weights. There was very little padding. I guess they are okay if you are lifting very light weights like 5 or 10 pounds. Otherwise, stay away from these. I gave them away and ended up using my old worn out gloves which provided a lot more support!!!"
3,Good but too small for me,"These gloves are good quality, but I made the mistake of ordering the small size. Even though my hands and fingers aren't pudgy, the finger holes cut off the circulation to my fingers and I had to take them off after about 10 minutes of wear. If you're unsure as to which size to order, just order the large to be safe. I'll be passing these on to my teenage daughter and will probably order the larger size."
3,Not as Good as Mouse Paint or White Rabbit's Color Book!,"I ordered this book because I teach a class on colors and shapes at an art museum. I've used both of the others I mentioned in the tile for a couple of years and thought it might be nice to have something new to show how primary colors mix into secondary colors. The dog is cute, but the pages are small. The text is even too elementary for 4-year olds, I fear."
3,A good Saturday Afternoon Read,"I love Vicki Hinze mystery plots but I am not much of a fan romance novels. Duplicity took a while for the action to get good but it had some great twists and the characters were likeable. There was just a bit too much romantic back forth for me(I love him, no I can't love him)."
1,very used,Book had tons of crayon marks all over it on the inside. I will be very hesitant to buy another used book online...
5,Always delightful,"This cd is one of the few marketed for children, that a parent never tires of hearing.Nancy's voice is warm and full of love. Her music comes from all parts of the world and her messages to children are very empowering."
3,"Works well, most of the time","it's just ok. although there are ""teeth"", i was unable to get it to grip a banner i was trying to hang. maybe if there was some kind of non-slip rubberized portion to the teeth, that would help.if the tarp, or material, is not too slick or sufficiently thin enough, the teeth do a good job of holding on. overall, still a good product."
1,Warning: Do not buy this book unless you have the stomich to eat these foods,"I have 13 of the Retro Cookbooks, and enjoy everyone of them. But thank god my local Library has this book, and I should be thankful that I read this book at the library before I decided to buy this in which I did not. To be honest here. Most of these recipes are unappatizing. Tomato soup cake, spam smoothing, banana meatloaf and other food that just want to make my stomich turn and puke. Yuck. So if you are thinking about collecting the retro cookbook, I recomend both retro diners, Rerto ranch, retro beach bash and reetro kids cooking. But this one is to avold"
3,it freezes alot,"okay okay the game is pretty fun,but it is a pain to keep the stars happy,i have about 30hours in the game but i have noticed it frezzes alot that is a problem and unlike the sims this game is fun"
1,The Movies,This game was too old for the newer computer and therefore I could not load it. My grandson was very disappointed because he really wanted to play it. I felt like I got ripped off from Amazon for even offering to sell it knowing it was old and outdated.
1,It Doesn't Work,"If you have a new computer, don't bother, it won't run. Unless you have a computer like back in 2004."
1,doesnt even work,"the game the movies doesnt even work, i have tried everything and it still doesnt work, it just goes back after i install it and back to my main screen! it sucks, i know 2 people who got this game and it doesnt work on their computer either, so dont get the game it sucks"
3,question....,"Can you make the sims talk? I have considered buying the game but just finished a tutorial online where the only dialogue consisted of cartoonish ""dialogue boxes"" and whatever you typed. Is there any way to make the people actually SAY the dialogue?"
1,doesnt even work,"the game the movies doesnt even work, i have tried everything and it still doesnt work, it just goes back after i install it and back to my main screen! it sucks, i know 2 people who got this game and it doesnt work on their computer either, so dont get the game it sucks and thisi game is also waaaaaaaaay to expensive, and i cant believe i am saying that when our family is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay richer then any family in our neighbohood and we live in the biiigest house ever! thats really saying something about the game"
2,Repetitive Gameplay,"After downloading and playing through a demo, I was left wanting to continue playing. Later that week, I shelled out 50 dollars to buy this game. I expected some additions and variety from the demo, but I could not have been more dissappointed. A bunch of extra sets and actors, but not much else. The one part that I actually was pleased with was the music and radio announcements. The sound truly reflected on the time periods that you would play. Other than that, I honestly would say you should just play the demo over and over again until you are bored. Then you have experienced the equivalent of buying the full game for no price and less space taken up on your computer."
2,Addicting!!! But....,"...the novelty wears off. The fact that the movie making experience is very limited, redundant, and totally lacking. The stratagy part of it together with the ""fun"" and creative parts of the game is completely off-putting. But it's a fun game for the first 5-10 hours of play."
4,I'm Addicted!!,"I love this game! I was a little skeptical at first because I didn't think the graphics would live up to The Sims and Roller Coaster Tycoon games. I think the graphics are pretty good and this game is so much fun, and addictive! The only caveat I have with this game is that they could have done much better with the wardrobe, hair, jewelry choices. If you love tycoon games, I would highly recommend this one."
