5,Great Car Seat - Super Comfy!,"This car seat is like a child's own little recliner!I wish OUR car seats were this cozy!!!Easy to install, and easy to adjust!"
5,Really comfortable and sturdy,"My 13mo daughter enjoys it. It's much more comfortable than her previous infant seat (Graco SnugRide). We have a Graco convertible seat for my older daughter (3yr) that has just taken a beating, and does not feel or look as comfortable as the evenflo triumph. Some of the Graco's styrofoam is breaking off, and some of it we duct-taped together. We are going to replace that seat with the evenflo triumph!"
5,Simple adjusting,"My nine-month-old daughter is in the 95th percentile in height and weight and outgrew her carseat carrier. She has used this for three months and seems to be comfortable in it. I chose this carseat for its safety ratings, consumer ratings, design and accessories. This carseat is designed to easily tighten/loosen straps. I recommend that when adjusting the height of straps, do so in your home prior to installing the carseat. This will allow you to have maximum space to adjust settings and learn how the straps work. When I turn the yellow knob to loosen the straps, I like the fact that when I pull the belt loose on one side, it will automatically loosen the other side as well. My trick to adjust the straps at the shoulders: one side at a time, hold the straps parallel to the ground and feed the strap in while pulling on the other end (of the looped strap)."
4,The spirit of psychadelia lives on,"The Psychic Ills capture the spirit of late 60's psychadelia and repackages it into a trippy multicoloured experience. 'Dins' is one of those albums that blurs the lines between spacerock, shoegazing, and psychadelia. Just think the mind expanding freak-outs of Spacemen 3 and Hawkwind meeting the neo-psychadelia of The Warlocks and trippier moments of The Dandy Warhols. Throw-in the dream pop of The Cocteau Twins and the experimental noodlings of Frank Zappa. 'Dins' is a trancelike cacaphony of sound and reverb, definitely one of the must hear releases of 2006. Tune in. Trip out."
5,A must read for anyone of his generation,"Payne demonstrates a rare level of narrative ability with this book, which will be remembered as his best. His rendering of the same story from the voices of both male and female characters provides a rich texture and moving power to this novel. There is no question that this novel provides the benchmark against which all others of this nature will be judged. Payne fearless quest for the nexus of the nature of love, friendship, and memory is unashamed and pulls no punches. This is one of those rare books that will have an immediate and lasting impact on those who read it. If you read no other book of this decade, read this one"
2,Book starts with promise....but ends flat,"David Payne scores some compelling imagery and skillfully sets up what promises to be an equally compelling plot. I read eagerly at first, but gradually became disenchanted. In the last 200 pages, the plot grew increasingly absurd, especially in the resolution of a subplot involving two adult figures who influence the young protagonists. Payne's characters' dialog is clever; unfortunately, his plot is not so. If you want a truly stirring Southern novel with the same ""boy-girl-dead boy"" triad (I'm not giving anything away by saying that), then I recommend Robert Penn Warren's _All the King's Men._ Warren's book is many decades old, but it has aged better than Payne's Early From the Dance."
3,over-written melodrama,"I read this over four days at a North Carolina beach - a bit of local color. I started out interested, but by the end I was plugging through just to finish it. I had a real problem with ""Jane's"" voice; it didn't feel authentic to me. As a woman, I was constantly aware that this was a man's interpretation of a woman's thoughts and feelings. I also had real problems identifying with privileged young men who spend all their time doing lines of coke. And there is no way ""Adam"" came across as an artist, he displays none of the passion and drive for his art I've recognized in artists I've known. He wouldn't last a season in the New York art world without it. I could not care about these characters."
2,I wasn't impressed,"I am absolutely amazed at the positive reviews this book has received. I found the book tedious and the theme of 'love triangle' boring. The characters had very little character. I can't care about a coke-snorting, self-absorbed thirty-something and Jane did little for me either. Carey, instead of committing suicide, should have found someone more worthy of his love. I wonder why this author decided on the topic. He certainly too many pages to it. It is obvious I didn't enjoy this whiney book."
4,Looks great but somewhat limited usability,"I use photos of posed action figures to make a comic strip, so I'm looking primarily for articulation and good detail. The detail on this Anakin is great, but the articulation, while better than some figures out there, still leaves much to be desired. The ""Jedi Power Kick"" feature is simply ludicrous - the button on the back makes his legs separate a full 0.75"". The springy leg joints needed for the power kick mean that he can't stand on his own without a platform. The shiny metal lightsaber handle is a great feature."
1,"One dog's mint, another dog's ""poison""!","I gathered from the reviews of this toothpaste that it is a winner with quite a number of dogs. Obviously, they just don't all like the same things! I am not sure if its the taste or the smell of the toothpaste but my golden is just completely put off by it. He's receptive towards the toothbrush without the toothpaste."
5,GREAT TOY,"This toy is fantastic! First off it has great detail on the dress, arms, and especially on the face mask. It has four points of articulation and a Graffi Stick that she can hold. Also, as an added bonus she comes with a little child(smaller that Boba Fett) that can fit in a pouch on her back, and the child can move its arms so you can play with it also. Overall this is a great toy and, if you get a male Tusken Raider, you can have your own little family."
5,Tusken raiders like we've never seen them before!,"This is an awesome figure! It's certainly different from the Tusken raiders we're normally used to seeing.Looks-wise, the female is awesome. Detail is great, especially the decoration around the chest and face.As for articulation, for obvious reasons, the figure is restricted in this area. You can move both of her arms though(from the elbow points), her waist(although the figure is actually is basically composed of two parts- her legs/upper body, and her face, arms and carrying pouch), and her feet.The child is a really good idea for an accessory. Additional points must be given for the child's articulated arms. The child can fit into the female's back pouch. She also comes with a gaffi stick that she can hold."
5,The Biography of Elizabeth Montgomery,"This was an eye opening biography into the life of Elizabeth. I have loved her for many years, as bewitched. I had also seen her in other movies, I must praise her in ""The Lizzie Borden Movie"". This bio, is wonderful! It shows footage from Elizabeth as a child until the end. I had always considered her as a funny, lovable, and wonderful actress. This bio also hits on her strong points, she had tremendous strengths and values. You will truly see her shine, as one of the all time talented and beloved actress's that she was! You will not be disappointed with this bio. WE LOVE AND MISS YOU LIZ!!"
1,Hide and Seek,"This book lacks a clear direction for any student. If the student is lost within the exercises he has no way of knowing if he is on the right or wrong approach of tackling a problem, a partial solution would be helpful for the exercises. I give this book a big thumbs down. It is of no help. I wonder why University of West Florida still uses a book that is not even supported by the publisher."
5,Jango Fett: The Absolute Peak of AOTC Goodness,"Jango, ""evil"" bounty hunter, certainly lived up to my expectations. I have a question, though. If he's got a removable helmet, dual blasters with holsters, and a missile firing jetpack, then how come he doesn't have a razor to shave with? Maybe he does, but he has bad hand-eye coordination, and that's why his head's all scarred up. Aaaw, who cares? He's still the coolest action figure under the sun. His grappling hook can grab onto itself, so he can hang from any horizantal bar. He is, hands down, the coolest AOTC action figure. In fact, he was the first one I bought the day they came out (""Mace Windu and the Battle Droid"" set was second). Anyway, if you buy one action figure this summer, get Jango Fett: Kamino Escape. If you buy two action figures this summer, buy Jango Fett: Kamino Escape again. LOL, just kidding, get Darth Tyranus."
5,JAngo Fett Kamino Escape,"This is the most awesome Jango Toy out there it fits Slave I perfectly!It's fun because of:The Grapling Hook,The firing Jet Pack,The Removeable Helmet etc It teaches you alot about Jango Fett too! ***** out of ***** 5/5!"
5,Great Toy!,"This is a great star wars toy. It is a nice piece to your collection or to play with. Jango comes with custum western-34 blasters that can fit in his hands or can go in his holsters. He has a removable helmate and jet pack that really fires a bore missle. Plus his right gantlit features a whipcord thrower to catch his victom. All in All this is a great toy for a great price, it really is the best Jango feet out of the three."
4,JANGO FETT ROCKS,"I just bought a Jango Fett Kamino Escape figure, it's awseome, the color scheme is tight. So are the gun holders and the roacket.The only complaint is that the grappling hook string is too long and just dangles around when not used, it's a nuesance, they needed someplace to put the extra string. I also found a messed up jango fett figure, on the visor which is supposed to be black was not painted in production so it's just blue, it'sreally cool."
5,fett mania,"this is the best jango figure.the helmet is removable and the guns are cool[no blast effects though].the jetpack is good.the face isn't so good though.goes well with boba fett figure.not good in sand or water.educational references to armour,weapons and bounty hunting.great toy."
3,not too bad,"I like this toy, but I didn't think Attack of the Clones was very good. Save your money and buy a classic Boba Fett figure off of ebay."
3,simple- ok,"This is a good book for the average horse owner / caretaker (layperson). It basically shows you how to determine if something is an emergency (i.e.- whether or not you should ""CALL THE VET."") including what you should do until the vet gets there, AND how to do it. Just about all areas were covered- from eye injuries to hoof care. BASIC first aid techniques are provided, and described well.The one thing I did not like, is that it did not give you much information as to what was really going on. Specifically, it did not correlate signs and symptoms with any specific ""diagnosis."" However, I do have a healthcare background (no, I'm not a veterinarian)- so my review is based on what I expected a ""Complete Book of First-Aid"" to be. That is.... complete and thorough. I expected more information about how to care for various injuries and illnesses, whereas I found the focus to be on just stabilizing a problem until the vet comes"
4,Wonderful Book,"This book is a life-saver. It's easy to follow instructions make it a must. I especially like the sections that list symptoms and if it says to call your vet immediately, it tells you what to do while you're waiting. The only drawbacks to this book are that the cover doesn't hold up well, and it would be better with color pictures of the toxic plants. I strongly recommend this book if you have horses."
5,Will pay for itself many times over,"This book will pay for itself with the money you will save from unnecessary emergency vet visits. Using clear yes/no questions, the book takes the guesswork out of knowing whether you need to call the vet or if it is something that you can treat yourself. The book is alphabetized by sign, so if your horse has a bump, you look up ""bump."" It tells you exactly how to deal with the just about any problem and, if you need to call the vet, what you can do while you're waiting. In addition, it is a handy reference guide with vaccination and deworming schedules, how to check a horse's condition, how-to give injections or wrap and has a photographic index of plants that are toxic to horses. In my opinion, EVERY barn and horse owner should have a copy of this on hand."
4,"Gene ""The Dean"" Colan finally recognised!","Any fan of Marvel Comics will recognise Gene Colan's work, on Iron Man, Daredevil, Black Panther, Sub-mariner Dr. Strange, Dracula and a host of other books. Though his eyesight was once at risk and a tribute book was published to raise funds for an operation, this work should be superior. If you let it slip through your fingers, you will be forever sorry. I urge you to pick it up now, before this comic book artist treasure slips away."
3,Incorrect Description for the Picture Shown,There's not really a way to rate this because the picture shown does not match the description of the product. The description of the item is for a Trijicon RA01 Tritium Sight and the picture is for some sort of exercise equipment.
4,Quick Reads... Questionable Cost,"John W. Freeman's two volume set represents the best ""plots only"" collection of opera synopses available. All the operas are summarized in sparing, unambiguous language. Some operas are summarized so succinctly that too much mystery remains. Freeman provides helpful biographical material on each composer represented.Describing this collection as a two-volume set is somewhat misleading. It is, in effect, a book and its sequel. Volume 2 was published several years after the first to fill in some holes. For this reason, operas from one composer may be divided disproportionately between both volumes, and neither volume indexes the contents of the other.Consolidating both volumes would enhance navigation and presumably reduce the cost, which is without question the least desirable feature of this competent set."
5,"love this product, but faulty packaging???Paid for 6, got 5","These are one of my favorite shower items! I am so happy to have found them on Amazon, as I can no longer find them in stores. My only gripe is that I got a nice and neat little package of what looked like 6 buf pufs, but upon opening the plastic holding the 6 boxes only 5 boxes contained a puf!! So I guess I paid the amount for 6 and an empty box? I'm not sure if this is Amazon or 3M fault."
5,Best facial sponge ever used,"Why is this item so hard to find? Its the best facial sponge I've ever used. Lasts forever, holds its shape well, unlike cheaper ones that fall apart after a few uses. This multi-pack will last me a long time, even though I use it every day. I also keep one in my travel accessory bag. I do not like those phoofy balls on a string. I like the scruffier feel of Buf-Pufs for heels, elbows & knees, especially."
3,not really what i thought,I used this once and i didn't feel it did anything. I stopped using it. I wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge.
5,Great product!!,I have been using this product for years and my face is smooth and soft.I recommend it highly! Cheaper to use this with your favorite face soap than using a bunch of expensive products!!!
5,The Best,Buf-Puf's are THE BEST!! All the other facial sponges last less than a month when used daily but Buf-Puf's are effective for 7 to 8 months!!! I've been a Buf-Puffer for 30 yrs and use nothing else.
5,Simply the BEST!,"This product is fabulous!! When you get a facial that usually costs upwards of $75.00 the first thing done to your face is exfoliating the dead cells. You can do this once or twice a week just as well if not better with this wonderful little puff. It keeps my face glowing, free of unsightly roughness and bumps, and the texture looks and feels great. I only wish I could give it 10 stars!!! I have been using this for over 20 years and I wouldn't be without it. P.S. My skin looks fabulous!!"
4,"Buf-Puf works for guys, too","I've used Buf-Pufs to clean my face for years. The little scrubber works wonders on minimizing razor burn and ingrown hairs, as well as keeping my skin smooth and clear of blemishes. I only wish that a five-cent piece of spun plastic didn't sell for nearly $4, but no similar generic pad I've tried lasts nearly as long nor works as well."
3,Not so much. . . .,"I am not as crazy about this particular sponge as I am about the Buf-Puf individual sponges, but it gets the job done. I just find that I get more use out of the individual sponges than I do with this one. It just doesn't seem sanitary to use after a few uses and I end up throwing it away sooner than I am suppposed to. I feel I get more for the money with the individual sponges."
3,Jar Jar Returns! ... Why?,"This figure is very hard to play with, since it's legs do not move. It is also very boring because it stays in the same pose. It is very detailed and the robes are very well sculpted. But who wanted to see Jar Jar Binks return? I didn't. He's very annoying. I just got him because I wanted a Senator. But kids can have fun with him, with his staff accessory with detachable lightning. All in all, a pretty mediocre figure."
5,Plus ca change...,"Revel set the record straight, regarding the failure of Europe to appreciate how the geopolitical context has deeply change since 9-11. What has NOT change one bit, is the rabid antiamericanism of the European elites, (he is especially critical of the French) which blind them to the necessity to deal with the terrorism threat in a very firm and decisive way.True to his acerbic and rigorous style, Revel has done it once again: dispel myths with numbers, coherent arguments and abundant references.To those interested by geopolitics, I highly recommend this book. It has not been translated in English yet, but it is only a matter of time. I'd ventured to predict it'll be a success as great as ""Whitout Marx or Jesus"""
4,"The ""Thalia's Debut""","This is the debut album Thalia's solo career. The CD is one of the items rare and sought after by fans and collectors. Contains classic tracks like ""Un Pacto Entre Los Dos,"" ""Amarillo Azul,"" ""Thalisman"" and ""El Poder De Tu Amor."" Although not the best of the early work of Thalia, worth acquiring, because it is quite different and quite rare, especially the first edition under the label ""Discos America""."
4,Sony-Mp3 walkman,the product is amazing BUT when the sun is out it kind of hard to see the screen when it is sunny! otherwise the thing can store a massive ammount of songs plus you get the option of turning on the radio if you get bored of lsnin to your songs or you want to catch up with the news which is great!
4,YAY,"Lovely player, good sound, very intuitive controls. The software is a pain in the butt and the operation has a bit of a learning curve. But take some time, download the drag and drop driver from Sony and everything should be fine."
4,love it!,"Has a great look, very modern & sleek! The screen is really neat, but it's hard to see when using outdoors in the bright sun. Love how compact it is, how light it is, and how the small number of buttons and things do so many different things. I do wish there was a arm band for it, but I have concocted my own using a wrist band (sweat band thing) which works fine.It has great sound - I love the various sound options!One thing I don't like... there are different screen settings, and when you switch one to show the time or something, I wish it would show the music information when you switch songs, but it doesn't. If you select the time to be shown, you'll see that only until you switch over to the other Display mode.I have had some problems w/ the software... but I got songs onto the player in the end. It's not too user friendly.But overall, I am thoroughly enjoying it."
3,Not as quick to operate,"When I first purchased this item, I loved it. I really appreaciated the very long battery life and how quickly it charges back up. However, I have noticed that it now does not hold its charge as long, or it doesn't charge up all the way. I do not do any exercising activities with it, so I have never had the moisture under the screen problem and it has help up very well in the past two years that I have owned it. However, I started to feel the annoyance of the fact that you cannot fast forward or rewind songs. Also, you can't just push a button to go the the next song. I have to go to the main menu, go into the albums, find the album, and scroll down to find the next song that I want. Other than these small annoyances, it works great!"
1,Software nightmares!,"Do Not Buy This! unless you are dying to balance ripped cds, with new cds to rip, and downloaded music on the same Sony software, it flat out sucks. I spend no less than an hour trying to put songs on it, and SonicStage is so bad. I wish I could just use Windows Media Player, but even after the file conversion software upgrade, I'm still looking to sell this and buy something different. looks are great, which is what prompted me to buy this, but it's function over fashion dear! Another example of Sony over-engineering and over-designing something simple."
4,No armband available,"The product is good, but its very diffficult to use it for sports moments, because of the lack of a coresponding armband, and the clip it has its weak and tends to break easily.Without having an armband, the wires are exposed to movement and they could break easily."
5,Great item for a small size and price,"This player has great sound and easy to put music onto the unit. The metal case makes it real hard to break, if you drop it by accident there really isn't a problem. If you want a player that works and sounds great for a low price this is the one to get."
1,Refurbished Seller 'SHIPTOYOU' uses BAIT AND SWITCH,"Just yesterday the price was $99 for this item from SHIPTOYOU. After I emailed him a question regarding the color, he raised the price 20%. When I emailed him back asking why, his only response was ""Well I sold 4 more since I raised the price"". Don't give this guy yur money. It's basically a $20-$25 savings for a refurbished item which means it was returned but not necessarily fixed. Buy new!"
3,pretty kool,i am buying this player for the 3rd time..this time i didnt receive any case like key chain kind which shows in the product. also head phones wires are too short it coudnt reach from my jeans pocket to my ears. so really below avg. sounds quality is netime better but make sure u get all accesorries...
4,Amazing,"It's really small, battery lasts forever and has tremendous capacity when you use the ATRAC3 format which works perfectly. The conversion programs are easy to use so you can use all the space available in the walkman. For me the only downside is the SonicStage jukebox version included since it is too basic."
1,Don't even accept one for free as a gift--(0 stars),"functionality of device itself is good but the software you HAVE to use is terrible. Why can't it just be drag and drop through windohs explorer? I just don't understand proprietary third party software. I bought a Sony cd mp3 player a couple years ago, installed the software and almost immediately uninstalled it because it was so bad and just made mp3 cds with whatever burning software I had--couldn't have been happier that way. In my experience Sony software is far less than functional and is to be avoided and here you are not given the option to not use it unless you just want to use you player as an expensive 1G storage drive. That alone makes it not worth buying. Stick with players that are open source. As for the authorization thing to get files off the player? I wish there was an option here to give less than one star on the review. Player sounded good though and didn't have cosmetic problems some note before I returned it."
2,I thought i had a great device,"I really enjoyed this device up until 3 weeks ago. It has long battery life and a large capacity for storage. BUT that does not matter if it just cuts off on you. Lately, has I hit an hour mark of running, it just shuts off. I did notice that the player looked as if it had moisture inside so i thought it was from my sweat. After reading the other reviews, i realize this is a feature of the player--- moisture getting trapped inside....I wish I would have known this before, I would have just gotten an IPOD. Anyhoo, on top of that, if you run in the daylight (which i believe most of us do) you can't read the player because of the reflection against the sun. I find myself having to hover over it or go to a dark space in order to see what songs I am changing it too....If you don't run, and just sit around with it, buy it, but if you plan on doing any activities with it (i.e. running, walking, excercise) DONT BUY IT!!!"
2,works indoors as long as you aren't moving fast,"I purchased this device primarily because I wanted an FM receiver. I liked the compact size, capacity, battery (charge and recharging) but I intended to wear it while running. First, the manual stinks and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off, or stop the repeats. Eventually I worked that out. The ear buds caused sores in my ear canals and constantly fell out. I replaced these with SONY $80 ear buds that aren't much better. Then I couldn't see the display when I ventured outdoors. The quality of the display just kept getting worse, until it died completely. Finally, the whole thing stopped playing after 27 days. I took it back to SONY and the manager told me that it had been abused. He would send it back to SONY for an autopsy and let me know whether it was covered by the warranty. I simply used it while running. I haven't received the forensic report yet but I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,is it really a usb 2.0?,"I didn't know that until I read the spec.I also didn't know that usb 2.0 can be this slow.It's like... you're driving ferrari in freeway at 20mph!Why did Sony make this device USB 2.0 if it takes 10 sec to transfer one song, and another 10 sec to refresh the list?I now can see why iTunes is great.After several Sony cassette player, Sony MD Plyaer, Sony CD Player, and now Sony mp3 player, I will never buy Sony again."
4,Unbelievable Battery Life,"Battery life is great, you really don't need to worry about charging this player. Menues are pretty easy to work with but the fact that there's no search option can sometimes make it somehow cumbersome to work with, try making playlists so you can find things easily."
1,Electronic waste,"Don't bother with this unless you have infinite patience, a vanilla windows installation and lots of time to waste. The hardware is nice but SonicStage and XP don't co-operate. I had OpenMG Jukebox installed and have this unit and an older NetMD MZ-N707. OpenMG doesn't work with this unit and when you install SonicStage, you are required to uninstall OpenMG or SonicStage does not install (apparently SonicStage doesn't even co-operate with OpenMG Jukebox!). Unfortnately, OpenMG fails to uninstall so SonicStage won't install so now neither unit can be recorded to. #$%#$% waste! If you must self-flagellate, get a board and join a monestary but don't give Sony your time or money."
1,"its alright, but if i could do it again i would buy something else.","As far the physical player goes its pretty cool. small, good controls, long battery life, etc....However that is all the good things i have to say about this player. I bought it because it could be used with windows 98, which is what my old computer runs. The software is a pain in the ass!!! even though the package states it recognizes WMA, WAV, MP3, etc... it actually only works with sony's ATRAC3. the software converts all other files to this form, which seems to take forever. I had a iriver before this one and as soon as i get back from my trip I'll be selling this sony on ebay and finding a iriver, used if thats all i can find. sony can kiss my arse!!"
5,Excellent pick over the Nano,"The player is superb. It is small yet comfortable, flash-based so there are no moving parts- excellent for jogging or commuting, and the design is the best I have seen for a flash mp3 player. It is probably smaller and sleeker than the Nano, it gets 4 times the Nano's battery life, and it is apparently much more durable and less likely to scratch.There are complaints about SonicStage software, but it is not so bad, it seems as easy to use as Itunes. Besides, you can download the MP3 file manager update here, for easy drag-and-drop support, and then you don't have to use SonicStage at all- http://esupport.sony.com/perl/model-swu.pl?mdl=NWE507My only significant complaint is that there is no support for .wma drm playback- But you should be able to find what you need in .mp3, and if not, you can always burn itunes or yahoo music store tracks to CD, then rip to MP3-I would recommend this player--Joel"
3,4 week review -- Flimsy clip -- Overall good product,"4 week reviewI have had this for about 4 weeks now. Use it while I jog. The flimsy clip snapped one day as I was trying to unclip it. Wonder why Sony couldn't give us a sturdier clip.Haven't tried loading songs back to another PC from the player. From other reviews, it sounds like a hassle.Overall, am pleased with this gadget. Battery life is awesome. FM sounds great. Love the looks.Hate the bundled earphones."
4,"Can't see display outdoors, but very nice piece","You have read how wonderful it is from the others, and it is quite nice. However, there are 2 points that make this 4 stars for me. #1 - the display is very hard to read outside with the sun shining. It would have been nice to have an ""extra bright"" option for the display. #2 - the supplied earbuds are terrible. The sound quality, layout & features are otherwise great."
1,Software Killed the Deal,"I wish I had read some of the reviews before I bought this Sony product. For the record I am a big Sony fan. My TV (Sony Vega) and all of my surround speakers are Sony. My amp is Sony. My DVD player is Sony, etc.. So I thought that I would be safe if I bought this Sony device. Wow, was I wrong. I could only get the FM functionality to work, that's it! The software was very complicated and as others have stated, as the sony software assumes you are a song pirate and forces you to validate the songs you already have on your computer.. After 3 hours of trying to get my MP3's from my IBM laptop to me Sony Network Walkman I gave up. I am returning this tomorrow."
2,Can't do more than walk in this product.,"I bought this product with the intention that I would be able to jog and listen to music. Especially since sony claims it has a one hand toggle system for joggers. The overall product isn't bad, but the headphones are totally pathetic. There is no possible way one could job long distances and expect those earbuds to stay in. If you are planning to use this for any kind of exercise I would look elsewhere."
1,Horrible,"I have had my player for a week and I have yet to get the sonicstage software to work properly even with the updates. Every time I try to edit my library the progam has to close I lose everything I had just been working on. Not to mention that when I tried to transfer my music from my device back to my library following the instructions in the operators manual, it gets deleted from my library altogether. The customer service technician was a joke. It is definitely not worth the money I paid for it. I'm probably going to return it and go with another brand."
4,Sony NW-E507 Network Walkman 1 GB Digital Music Player with FM Tuner,"I am pleased with this product. I was considering purchasing the apple i-pod which does not have an fm tuner. That was the determining factor in my selection. The product works well while the soft ware is a little difficult to use but with time is becoming more routine.Mps sound quality is good. I use this item primarily on commuter trains and the fm reception is fair. It is small enough to fit in you shirt pocket and it looks cool. A single charge can last me all week, approx 8 hrs of use each week.I did not like the headphone extension cable. The male / female ends have to be inserted at the proper depth or no audio is heard. I would recommend offering or purchasing two different headphones with different cable length if a short cable is desired."
1,Worse player I ever bought,If you want to listen to music and never want to expose it to the weather or the gym its probably fine. But it took only three trips to the gym and it died. I did have it in a protective cover but just the little sweat on my hands after the workout when I turned it off was too much. My Nano has being going strong for months.
2,great player if you don't mind waiting for TERRIBLE software,"All of the other reviews that complain about sofware problems are right! As a sony fan I took a gamble with this player and lost. On the surface they seem to have gotten it right:small, long battery life, good user interface, reasonably price, sony quality, etc.BUT, What good are these features if the sofware takes 2 minutes per album to upload? What is wrong with these people? The genious that designed this software should not only be fired from Sony, but blacklisted from the industry. This player is going back to the store... and I am afraid that it might be i-Pod nano time (something I have resisted)"
1,Won't play legal downloads from subscription services,"Be warned, the player will not play copy protected WMA files from subscription services such as Yahoo music and Walmart.I'm very disappointed and angry."
2,still too rough for me,I bought this Extra gentle sponge in search of a certain texture. I seems like a great sponge but it just too rough for my sensitive skin. I ended up using this as a body sponge so as not to waste my purchase.
3,A bit flimsy,"I have sensitive skin but even I felt that this was too gentle. I wasn't sure it was doing anything so I ended up scrubbing pretty hard. On the other hand, it really is ""extra gentle"" so maybe I just purchased the wrong intensity."
3,Does not last long,"It's a good facial sponge...soft enough for your face, but it just doesn't last long. Too fragile and falls apart/shreds.I do use other, more sturdier Buf Puf sponges and have been for years and do like the line."
5,Wonderful for sensitive troubled skin!,"My facial skin is quite sensitive, so I only use the Buf-Puf about twice a week, and that seems to be often enough to keep my face from breaking out, and also seems to help with the ""dirty pores"" situation. I squeeze a little facial cleanser onto my Buf-Puf and gently move it around in circles. I don't apply any kind of skin freshener or astringent immediately afterwards to avoid stinging and redness."
3,Technical flaw,"The craftsmanship of this kettle is outstanding. Paint is thick and rich, will change its shade a bit with temperature. The whistle is different here, it sounds more like locomotive signal - loud and low frequency. I used it on a gas stove and whistling nose lid (made of plastic) burned at the bottom a bit jamming the whistling element, and now lid does not close tight, therefore - no whistling. Looks like this kettle was designed with electrical cooker in mind.The main lid tends to get stuck half way when I close it, allowing steam to escape, which leads to no whistling.The handle is ergonomically located slightly on a back for no-strain pouring and is always cool enough to touch.Time to boil is slightly longer due the spherical shape of this kettle."
4,Keep a lid on it,"Nice tea kettle. I find that if I place the lid carefully so that it seats and clicks in, the whistle will work, otherwise there is not enough steam pressure to create the (albeit unusual) whistle sound.Part II--A month after i wrote the above, the whistle went totally silent. I've tried to fix it but I'm not as handy as the guy who wrote that he took the whole thing apart. I have a million things to take care of and--call me crazy--I expect my tea kettle to more or less take care of itself.I'm taking it back. C'est tout! I can't change my rating on this form but I would have to give it no stars at all."
1,A great disappointment.,"This is a beautiful kettle, but I bought it mainly for its loud whistle, which WAS truly loud when I tested it. For some reason, however, it doesn't always whistle--hence...DISASTER. I didn't hear it whistle so forgot about it, it overheated, and the black plastic melted. This is the second disappointment; the first was a Copco Virtu kettle, also beautiful, which didn't whistle at all because it was too loosely assembled. I will now have to spend almost $100 to get a kettle I can trust--one made of ALL stainless steel--no plastic."
1,Back to the Drawing Board,"I have had this Tea Kettle for about 1 year and this second time the whistle won't blow. Burns up if you can't hear the whistle. Followed all the recommendations about lid, etc. and it doesn't blow. Had it replaced by Chantal and this is the second one that won't blow. Back to the drawing board. They can't blame us for not being able to operate a tea kettle, but maybe it takes a genius to boil water after all."
1,This item is too hot to handle and not in a good way,"I purchased this tea kettle based on aesthetics since I was not familiar with the brand. The handle gets too hot to touch with your bare hand, even just before the water reaches boiling point. You will burn yourself before you make it to your cup. Do not spend the $50 on this poorly designed tea kettle and demand better design for the money. Mine is quickly going back for a refund."
4,Beautiful Tea Kettle,"This is a really pretty deep red and enhances the stove just sitting there. The handle is modern looking and comfortable, the trigger is placed for easy handling and pouring. My only complaint with this tea kettle is that there isn't a way to stop it from whistling - except turning off the heat and letting it cool down. Some tea kettles have a removeable whistle."
2,Bad Design Ruins the Whistle!,"I love the ""train whistle"" sound of Chantal tea kettles and was thrilled to find one with a trigger lift for the whistle, but after less than a month of use the oval shape of the kettle directs (gas) heat from the bottom of the kettle around to the top of the kettle, melting the otherwise sturdy plastic parts and ruining the seal over the spout, allowing steam to escape around and not through the whistle. How disappointing. I also suspect that with the wasted heat going around the kettle and not kept at the bottom, that boiling times are longer. I have now gotten a flat-bottomed, bell-shaped tea kettle (with a less fun whistle) that does a much better job and hasn't had problems. Too bad!"
4,Startling!!!,"Just what I wanted in looks, size, performance, with one dramatic exception. That whistle. The first time I used it I was looking out the window to see what could be causing such a loud alarm only to find to my shock that it was coming from the kettle. If you're a bit hard of hearing, this may be the tea kettle for you. If you want something softer, definitely not for you. It sounds just like the citywide alarm that goes off every Tuesday at Noon here, though the sound of the kettle whistle will probably only carry as far as your puzzled neighbors. But other than the whistle, this is a beautiful kettle, thoughtfully and ingeniously designed."
1,What everyone here says is true! this thing sucks!,"So i just bought this exact same tea kettle from bed bath and beyond yesterday for the same price, I chose this one first off because it is 18/10 stainless steel, secondly I liked the look of it and the ease of lifting the whistle cap with the lever.So I go ahead and heat up the tea kettle to see if what everyone here says is true, that it ""does not whistle!"" Well, for me, it whistled, but it was a very low quite sound, you can only hear it if you are only standing right in front of it which defeats the whole purpose of the whistle. If i was upstairs or in another room, I would not hear this! So it is true, the whistle does not work! This product is sorry, piece of junk. Shame on chantal, really disapointed for $50 you get this crap quality?!?! Im returning it and getting the kitchen aid one."
5,Bought as a Christmas present,"I bought this 3 years ago for my mother, who uses it all the time. The finish still looks good and it serves it purpose."
2,funny whistle - when it works,Loved the pot - nice design - easy pourProblem is- it quit whistling - I returned it. Over cautious but we had a fire a few years back and I could not worry about a coffee pot causing another one. I wish they made one just like it that worked
1,Hot Pink Boiled Water,"I tried to boil water three times and the water came out pink... hot pink !? I realized the washers from the two bolts that hold the lid handle were also red and were oozing a red substance. Yummy! Designed in the USA. Made in China. Will return.Too bad, really, because the stainless steel body was machined quite nice and it worked great with my induction cooktop."
2,Tea Kettle that doesn't whistle,"Looks great, just doesn't whistle. Initially we diagnosed the problem as being that the lid wasn't securely on, so steam was leaking out the top. But now I'm literally staring at the pot, with the lid properly placed, and steam coming out the spout. The water is obviously boiling, but there is no alert sound whatsoever. This lack of functionality is more than just mildly annoying."
2,Pretty but doesn't function well,"It's really a very pretty tea kettle, but I burned mine up in under two months. The whistle is sometimes hardly noticeable. One time I was busy and I became aware it was hot when I smelled burning plastic. I contacted the manufacturer who essentially noted the instructions say to stand and watch it. Why bother with the whistle then? No whistle would actually be safer because you'd know it wouldn't whistle. It has some nice design features and some poor design features and looks great, but you can get a nice looking tea kettle that will serve you better for half the price. It will last much longer too because you won't burn it up."
1,Doesn't whistle,The reviewers who said that this tea kettle does not whistle are right. It makes a faint peeping sound that couldn't be heard outside the kitchen.
2,Not for gas stoves,"We've had this kettle for about a year. It worked fine on our electric range, but when we updated our stove to gas it would no longer work. The bubble shape required me to put the kettle on one of the smaller eyes and then it would take 20 minutes for water to begin to boil. The shape of the kettle does not allow enough heat from a gas eye to make contact with the surface area of the kettle. This kettle would probably be great for re-entry to earth from space, but unfortunately it is not very good for heating water."
1,Poor Materials,We purchased the Chantal Loop about six months ago. Now it is completely unusable. The whistle stopped and ALL the plastic parts melted to varying degrees. I sent pictures to Chantal and they replaced the kettle with a different model at my request. Stay away from the Loop.
2,Dixie: The Confederate States of America in 2001,"This could have been an excellent novel. Being a rabid lover of American history, the concept of the South winning the Civil War piqued my interest. However, the details of the possible differences just aren't fleshed out enough. The basic plot line is a good one, almost believable. Again, not enough detail. Nor are the main characters dimensional enough to be despised or cheered on. They just are. I am aware that publishers will use a few typos in printed matter to weed out counterfeiting, this book has soooo many misspellings and wrong tenses that it is at times difficult to read."
5,the best chewbacca!!,this figure is awesome. he comes with a broken c-3po and a liitle gun thingy. this figure is also detailed. also if you put 3po's head in his body his head lights up. so does his back. i recommend this toy to any star wars fan. very rare.
1,Buyer Beware,"This was a true disappointment. I should have taken the other reviews more seriously. This article consists of the cover page and about 3 pages of text. It is 3 pages because the document uses a large font and is formatted to have 2"" margins, left and right.There really should be an option to rate it as 0 stars."
1,Don't Bother ... Please,"I bought this and should not have... if you want a poor imitation of an Andy Rooney editorial this might, just might, be worth 2 stars. It certainly was not worth $2.00."
1,Worthless article - don't waste your money,"Frankly I was disappointed with this. I gave it one star because I cant seem to review it and give no stars. I should have read the other reviews because they are all right on target. This is nothing more than a short article about how this woman had bad experiences with service companies. My children could have told me the same information and I would have saved the $2.00. I concur with the reviewer that said shame on you Amazon for selling such meaningless junk!PS - If you still want to buy it, call me and I will sell my copy for the same money...but no money back guarantee"
4,Good medical mystery,"I like this genre and this doctor did a good job. I hope he writes more. This story does hold your attention, which is a factor I always consider. The reader is not likely to completely figure out the ending by the tenth page as in many books now on the market."
3,fairly interesting medical thriller,"This is the first Leonard Goldberg medical thriller I have read and it has given me a taste for more of his work. The part of the book dealing with science is accurate and believable. His writing is not bad either. However, he uses the old theme of a female pathologist teaming up with a male police detective. I seem to remember several other books using this formula. It did keep my interest and was a quick read."
3,Bad,"When I bought him i thought I would get a much better toy. His arm gets cut off in the movie and Hasbro was able fit it into the toy, but his arm is the WORST PART! IT FALLS OFF TO EASY! The magnet is weak and if ot feels anything it will fall off. So you are going to have to buy some glue-tack when you buy him. His green sabre keeps on falling if you hit it too hard and his ""spinning action"" is slow. You have to wind it real fast to get a show. Overall an ""okay"" toy, but be prepared to be dissapointed!"
4,Basic Fun Anakin,"This figure is pretty good.I disagree with people saying the arm won't stay on.I ordered one in the mail and mine was okay.The spinning arm thingy made his wrist look a bit skinny,but otherwise this action figure is awesome.If you remove his green lightsaber you can make him look like normal Anakin.If you remove his blue lightsaber you can put him with you're other Jedi action figures and recreate the final battle.Overall,this is my favorite figure."
5,We lost the arm,"Great toy! Many, many hours of play so far. However, that arm fell off right away, and is out somewhere in the back yard, I'm sure! It is still being played with a lot, but the arm is definitely missed!"
1,Bad,The arm does not go back in the socket when it comes out weak magnet in arm. not fun to play with.
4,Good Figure,"Okay, I'm not the BIGGEST Star Wars fan out there, and contrary to what most of the maniacs of Satr Wars, I only saw the movie last night for the first time.I got Anakin awhile before I saw the film, and to tell you the truth, he was my only choice. There looked to be no other good Anakin figures out there, and he seemed to appeal the coolest.Anakin comes complete with 2 lightsabers, the reason you must watch the movie, and a special mechanism in his back that enables him to swing both lightsabers, as well as an excellent battle-wound simulation .... But here's where my review goes sour. I haven't even opened him yet. So sue me, go ahead. I want to keep him in a good condition. So basically, you shouldn't have any regards to my ratings, unless you base them on how he looks through the plastic."
3,Only for collectors.,"If you are a collector this is a great item. However if you have children who will actually play with it, don't buy it. The arm keeps falling and it won't stay, it becomes very frustrating for the kids (not to mention me who constantly has to keep putting it back on). I had to tape it so my kids could play with it."
3,A good attempt,"This action figure is a strong attempt to make an Anakin figure, but suffers from minor details. While the detailing is nice, and the two lightsabers are a nice inclusion, the joints leave something to be desired. With an unbendable left arm, and a right arm that is easily severed at the lightest touch, it is almost impossible to create any poses or scenerios involving this toy. While the outfit and likeness exceed Peasant Disguise Anakin, one hopes that Tatooine attack Anakin will improve this toy."
5,The photography is what makes this book unique,"Who knew you could get a lense in there?!? The photography is what makes this book so unique. Incredible details of what that little baby looks like, right down to her fuzzy face at xx weeks, way before anyone would guess the little wonder was so developed. I've never seen images like these anywhere else. I got the book for my wife as a Christmas present, early in her pregnancy, and now we're looking to buy a copy for someone else. This will surely deepen your appreciation for how precious life is."
3,This movie caught my attention,"Caught this movie on late at night, while watching saturday night live. I stopped watching that I kept watching this movie. I liked it a lot Tony, playing rich boy Michael was very handsome and Lynn Whitfield playing the detective who has to keep him alive was excellent. The movie actually had a lot of funny parts as well as a little to much action and violence as is the norm for many movies made at this time. Definetly worth watching and the ending is very satisfying."
2,"The best for now, but not worth buying.","The Nomad Jukebox is SDMI compliant. That is a bad thing, because it means that MP3s uploaded onto the player cannot be downloaded back to your computer. I think once people realize this MAJOR flaw, the returns will flood in. Hopefully next time around, creative will pay more attention to the needs of its customers instead of the industry. Download capability, more battery life, forward/""rewind"" capability, plug-ins (I cant listen to mp3s without the winamp fader plug in), these are not too much to ask for a ... player. If you need a multi-gig player today, you don't have a choice besides the big, flawed Jukebox. I for one will wait for the avalanche of multi-gig players just around the corner..."
4,Here is a little secret - This thing can be upgraded to 20gb,"Let me just say one thing - 20 GigabytesLet that sink in - 400 CDs - Your entire CD Collection with plenty of room to spare - and portable. This is the 21st Century.I popped out the drive, popped in a 20gb notebook drive and in 15 min I have the ultimate MP3 player.... Check the web for instructions on how to do it - it is sooooo easy!!!!OK, a couple of drawbacks - It took 2 days to download the music (and 1 day of getting my id3v2 tags all in order) and yes, it takes 5 min to boot, and sometimes can take a min or 2 to change screens, but when your playlist reads ""1 of 4500 items"" you forget all that."
3,Good but poor batteries and a little slow when turn on,I thing the Nomad Jukebox is a no a very good stuff. Easy to organize your files but you can use the batteries just for one hour. The Creative Play Center is not a good stuff too.
4,"Very impressive, but.......","This thing is quite good but is lacking in the audio output department. Let me explain; While it seems to do everything very well,it does not have a lot of OMPHhh as far as the volume control is concerned. According to the specs, the Nomad Jukebox is supposed to put out a 100 mw signal; my Sony Discman's 30 mw signal will just about deafen me, the Jukebox won't even come close, even though it's rated output is over three times higher. If it wasn't for that one item, I would have given it a perfect five.:')"
5,"Best in Everything! People, Dont complaint.","Not only does the Nomad Jukebox support Mp3 Files, WMA (windows media), and WAVE, but Data files as well. Thats true, with the latest firmware update, you can store any kind of data into your nomad jukebox. The Latest Firmare upgrade takes care of the few problems it had when it was first released giving me a big impression from Creative Labs commitment to excellence. The ripping process and transfer rate increased dramatically. It takes a little getting used to at first in getting to know the Playcenter software that manages your transfer of files. The CDDBA support is fast and easy to set up. I recommend this product, it sure as hell beats the original tag. It is well worth it."
4,freeze-ups: a problem solved,"To Tyler Ude (an Amazon reviewer) and others who have bought this Nomad and experienced a freeze-up (lock-up): Before you return this product, try pushing the reset button at the bottom of the player. This should reboot the system without losing data and un-freeze the machine. Because Nomad runs on a large hard drive with a buggy operating system, freeze-ups will often happen (like a computer). Even if there's a new and improved operating sys. freeze-ups are inevitable. So, just get used to pressing that little reset button."
4,Great Product,"Creative, you did a really nice job with this product!Ithink [most of the complaints] can be ignored once you have the headphones on and are listening to your music. The software is updateable, so the very few quirks will be worked out and they'll also implement remote control capabilities.It's a nice toy, a little expensive and hungry for batteries, but worth it to me."
2,meretricious trash,"I would smash this piece of junk into a wall if it wasn't a gift. Without wasting my time and listing all of my annoyance as other users have listed, but talk about frustration with charging the 3hour-long-usage battery!!! without exaggeration, 80% of the time when i have left the batteries in charge over night, only to discover the next day at the gym or in the cab that the machine is LOW ON BATTERY AND SHUTTING DOWN! My other set of batteries won't even charge at all!I've written complaints to Nomad and called, but what can you expect from an idiotic online tech support when the parent company has created such a NON user-friendly meretricious trash.Keep in the mind, when they say ""music for hours"", its only for 3! (unless you want to keep it at stationary for your car or home)And if you are an outdoor runner, look else where, this machine is a free weight in itself."
5,Terrificly awesome Book!,"The book was great with Amber finds what she thinks is lov in two men,But soon discovers who's really for her. You must read this book if you like love stories that aren't super sappy."
5,THE MOST AMAZING BOOK IVE EVER READ,"This book actually speaks abt the normal life OF RICH PEOPLE IN L.A. It really does bring out the actual scene of the riches , the way they shop at SAKS and the way they have parties . it really does relate to all of them . all id like to say is that maybe it is a little predictable but the way it has been put together is just amazing ."
3,MALIBU SUMMER WAS AWESOME!,"Wow! This book was awesome. I'm really not a person to read a book in three days until it comes to Malibu Summer. I couldn't put it down. It's about a girl named Amber who spends the summer watching a troubled boy in California. Turns out she gets caught in a love ""rectangle"" with three guys. What is she to do? I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about dream vacations and romance. I wish they'd write a sequel to this book. READ THIS BOOK! ITS THE BEST BOOK EVER!"

5,It was great!!!!,This book is great but don't get discourged by it's size. I read this book in 2 and a half days. It was that good. It's about this girl Amber who goes to Malibu for the summer. She dreams of meeting a handsom young man. She meets 4 and the one she least expected to like her likes her. She makes cool friends and goes to awsome parties. Makes tons of money.(the parents of the family just parcticly throws it at her) Besides what can get any better than a summer in Malibu!!!
1,Don't bother.,"This book is useless. If you bought into Markman's scheme, you have been hurt...badly. Markman obliterated his investors (Markman Multi-funds) over the past 2 and 1/2 years and is merging all of his funds into one to bury his abysmal performance. This book is drivel and was written by Markman to market his money management business. Run, do not walk, away from this self-promoting fluff."
5,Fun to read and filled with useful ideas,"If I had a financial planner, I certainly wouldn't be using one after reading this book! I found something interesting on almost every page. It's a far cry from the dry advice offered by most books and articles on investing! Mr. Markman provides new insights into practical approaches to investing that avoids the pitfalls of traditional financial planners. He not only explains why the investment industry has led people astray, he has straightforward remedies. Plus, the book is never boring. I read it in a few hours. I'd recommend it for anyone who's dissatisfied with their investment results over the past few years."
1,Rip R Markman Suicide is not the answer,Robert Markman shot himself in February. His investment approach had not been working and he had made promises he couldn't keep. I hope no one who invested with him and lost will do the same. Help is available.
5,Destined To Become A Classic of Long-Term Investing,"The world of investments is dauntingly complex. When enveloped in the uncertainty which that complexity inevitably engenders along with the greed and fear which every investor knows, even normally rational minds often compensate by regressing into primitive, rigid and, sometimes, even superstitious modes of analysis. When such analysis becomes the norm, misconceptions accumulate. This book shines the rare light of objectivity on some of the most destructive of these misconceptions, thus filling a glaring need in a field which has seen quasi-religious dogma largely crowd out clear-headed science.Mr. Markman is one of the very few in the industry with both the intellectual maturity to take a truly objective look at some of its most cherished beliefs, and the intellectual capacity to make that look productive. He has obviously taken great pains to keep his book accessible, and readers will find it as enjoyable as they find it enlightening."
5,"A ""Must Read"" for Every Investor","This is a must read for anyone planning to live on their retirement investments in the future. For those of us in our 20's and 30's, it could mean the difference of millions! I found that my financial planner has advised me on mutual fund investments using all of the conventional wisdom this book critiques. Robert Markman challenges this conventional wisdom with a sound review of the facts, common sense, and humor. ""Hazardous to Your Wealth"" is a quick, thought-provoking read for any investor--no matter how large or small."
1,thanks for nothing,"Nearly any golf book is worth the price if it contains one useful idea clearly expressed. This one is the exception. It might have been interesting if the Walrus had explained how he hits the ball, but he didn't."
5,Great book for introduction,"This book will improve your play.Walker goes through step by step how to improve your game.He starts by making sure that you understand basic tactics, then where others go to openings he goes straight for the end game. By using this approach he shows you how to win from established positions. Once again it is about tactics.From here he moves to openings, he gives you standard openings, then explains the principles behind them, once again it is tactics.I strongly reccomend this book especially to beginners and average players, but I beleive that everyone will come away with something from it"
2,A figure that makes Zero sense,I was shocked about this figure because never in the film does Boba hold a gun or puts on his Dad's gear. Either this figure is based a deleted scene or was just made to confuse the buyer. If your thinking of reliving a scene in the movie with this toy you'll be sadly disapointed.
4,great young boba fett!,"my boys like this figure, it has plenty of extra parts and is fun to play with...great young boba fett!"
4,Nice overview,"I really liked the diversity of stories in this book. They weren't all perfect as planned but offered a realistic and optimistic look at natural childbirth. I appreciated the different types of mom's. Single moms, different backgrounds, first timers and old pros. I have enjoyed reading the stories as I lead up to my own birth experience. I would recommend it to anyone considering natural childbirth."
2,"Cool Character, Not-So-Cool Toy","Even though I've almost completed my EpII collection, this was one of the first action figures I bought. During the arena battle, Kit sticks out as an excellent fighter with a cool look and determined facial expression. So as my favorite non-main character, I selected him among the first.The figure itself is pretty good. The paint, like on all EpII figures, is terrible. Every time I go to buy one, I have to compared 4 or 5 of the same character to find one where the paint looks halfway decent. The Force Pull effect is worthless. I wish Hasbro would just make realistic, fully-articulated replicas instead of these stiff, gimmicky figures. I gave this a 5-rating for ""Educational"" because it taught me that tiny magnets have virtually no attractive effect.Despite these limitations, Kit is a cool character and worthy of an EpII collection. Just don't try to play with it because it's no fun."
4,"kit fisto, my favorite extra jedi",this figure is cool!!! he comes with his lightsaber. if you have other jedi figures then this toy will be fun to play with. if u dont just get some more. i recommend this toy to any star wars fan.
3,not so soft,Bought it to replace a Jergins bath sponge - it's a little too coarse and not really flexible enough to use on your face. It will scour off dirt and exfoliate on the rest of your body. You really need avoid sensitive areas.
2,"Overall, this product was okay. The texture was ...","Overall, this product was okay. The texture was very coarse and it didn't feel very good on my skin at all. I'd much rather use nothing at all than use this. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends or family. It was too harsh on my skin."
1,I definitely wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. ...,"I definitely wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I have extremely sensitive skin and the texture of the sponge was way too abrasive for me. It left my skin red and irritated, even when I used the side that was supposedly less coarse. Overall, I didn't like the product at all."
2,Very harsh on the skin,"These sponges are great for washing really dirty dishes. However, they are very harsh on the skin."
5,Great Product!!,"CVS stopped selling these a few years ago, so I have been searching and have finally found my Buf-Puf's! The price is lower than CVS's price and the shipping was really fast! I love this product!"
5,Excellent product for exfoliation,I will be back to buy this product again and and again. You cannot find this product in the stores. I was very pleased to find it here. I will be a multiple purchaser. I highly recommend this product for exfoliation.
1,buf puf body,"The product arrived quickly. The pad itself was a very, very hard piece of nylon/polyester. I understand how to use all facial products, I read all instructions. I have never understood why companies put out such horrible products like these buf-puf pads. If you are looking to rub off your epidermis layer and expose all that is underneath, then this is for you. My face was on fire after using this pad. The only thing this pad is good for is cleaning soap scum off of your tub."
4,Almost perfect...,"I love this thing, except for one ""small"" problem - literally.It's too small for my hands. I am an average sized male with average-sized hands, but this thing is too small for my hands.. Sure, it works and I use it every day, but if they just made it a little bigger (30% maybe?) it would be perfect.Other than that, no complaints. I use the rough side for everything, though people with more gentle skin will probably want to use the softer side most of the time."
5,the best cookbook ever!,This cookbook has it all! The recipes are easy to follow and give wonderful recipes for anything you would like to make. If I only could have one cookbook- this would be it.
2,Not As Good As I Remembered.....,"When I married, 21 years ago, I was given a copy of The Betty Crocker Cookbook as a wedding gift. It was my cooking bible in those early years of marriage. It was a wonderful cookbook and I still love it and use it. I was anxious to see if the newest printing was a great as my ""old faithful"". Sadly, I was not impressed with it. I prefer the spiral binding as it lays flat when in use. I thought the cover boards and binding were rather cheap. I agree with one other reviewer, it should be printed in the USA and not in China. In my opinion, it will not hold up as well as the older versions did. I was not particularly crazy about the size either, I thought it on the smallish side.The latest printing of the Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook is a far superior choice for a good ""basic"" cookbook. If you can only afford one cookbook, do not buy The Betty Crocker Cookbook."
4,Misled,"Item listed as 9th edition, received 10th edition. no time to return, bought for birthday present. I guess it will have to do, but definitely not happy about it. If it had been for myself it wouldn't have bothered me as much, but it is for my mother's birthday.Update:Received the correct book today. The mistake was corrected by the seller without me even asking, thanks so much!"
5,You will be pleasantly surprised,"You will be pleasantly surprised by this book. This book has a lot of information that goes along with the recipes. You will be amazed at all of the supplimental information that goes into this book. The way to buy fresh vegetables, how to look for good cuts of meat, ways to stretch meat, and a host of ideas with each recipe. The book is clearly written, and it makes it very easy to read. There are pictures for many recipes as well, this pictures aren't of just the finished product either. I think you will find this book covers the basics, and goes well beyond that. If you know someone that is just starting out, or perhaps learning to cook this would be a great choice for them."
5,BEST cookbook...,"If I had to choose only one out of my many cookbooks....this would be it! I actually paid $26 for this ""like-new"" with free shipping. Now is a great time to purchase this, as there are a bunch of gently used ones for around $7-$12including shipping. It is worth every penny. I purchased another one because mine had been used SO MUCH in the last 20+ years that I wanted to start over with a ""fresh"" copy of exactly the SAME cookbook. I have never made a recipe out of this book that didn't turn out good and taste great. HIGHLY recommended...especially for any ""novice"" cooks! I received mine as a wedding gift in 1990 and still to this day, use it just as often."
2,"Good, but not for people with high blood pressure","This is an excellent reference guide, but the sodium content of the food is too high. The Potato Casserole Supreme has 1,060 mg. of sodium. If you eat this, you can't eat anything else the entire day!This was from the Vegetable section! The California Black Bean Burgers have 750 mg. of salt; and this is from the vegetarian section. However, you can learn cooking basics from this book. It explains and illustrates how to pick a variety of foods, how to prepare foods, utensils that every kitchen should have and states how long to keep foods. It even states that wheat flour should be stored in the refrigerator because it could turn rancid due to the oil content. I didn't know that and I have been cooking for decades."
5,Best Cookbook,"My son, who is a chef, indicated the other day that sometime during one of his moves he had lost his Betty Crocker Cookbook. Being on Amazon, I ordered him another copy, thinking I got his the latest issue. I evidently hit the wrong button and he got an old edition. He was thrilled! He didn't care how old the edition was, he had his Betty Crocker Cookbook again!"
5,a great addition to any cooks kitchen collection,"Love the modern variations on old clasics, More Pics of the food noted too. Very easy to read."
5,Perfect gift for a new bride,I bought this book for a bride and she absolutely loves this book (her page on pancakes is nearly worn!). This book is wonderful for the new cookers since the recipes are practical and the instructions are easy. If you can't figure out what to purchase for the bride besides a toaster- purchase this book. It is a wonderful reference cooking book and it will be a life-saver!
5,good book,i bought it because i had one and my sister borrowed it with no return date to give it back. since i miss it so much i got another one for me that way ill let her keep the one shes not planning on returning.
1,Picture of cook book did not match the edition for sale,"I purchased 2 cookbooks with the cover that matched with the edition I wanted, when I received them in the mail it was the wrong edition, and a different cover. When I contacted the seller they said they didn't add the picture. They were sorry for the confusion and said I could return them for a refund, but that would have been more than the cost for the cook book. There needs to be some sort accountability with making sure the picture and the product match. This was a very disappointing experience and the fault lies with the book seller and amazon."
1,Feeling deceived,"When I pulled the page up to view this item, it was what I was looking for, right down to the ISBN number. However, when I received it in the mail -- it was an older edition, not the ninth edition with the ISBN # I was led to believe I was purchasing (as shown on the web page). I felt completely ripped off, because this book (used) did not offer free shipping, and for me to pay the shipping return fee would have cost more than the used book's purchase price. Remember the old saying, ""if it's too good to be true, than it probably isn't true""? Well, buyers beware -- the picture you are seeing, may not be what you receive in the package. My invoice did not even list the ISBN # for the book. I may buy from Amazon, but not from the vendor that handled this transaction. Thanks for a cookbook that is not useful for my daughter's cooking class. NOT!"
4,SUPPORT USA (SAFE PRACTICE),The lay out is very colorfull. As this is my first attempt at cooking I found it very easy to use. The My concern is the helpfull hint showing hitting a large sharp knife with your hand to crush garlic. I have (2) fingers on my hand that will never move again as I severed the tendons hitting a knife.not crushing garlic). The blade demo in the book would only have to tip slightly on something hard and very serious damge would occur to the hand. It seems to me this book could and should be printed in the USA for its citizens to use. (The job saved could be your own) I called their information line and was told they didn't know it wasn't made here. After I purchased the book I found on the second page where it came from. It is not my desire to support communist countries.
2,tab broke after a few Months,I bought this because it was cheap to mount on the header of my 1969 Chevy C10 pickup after I installed a crate motor and did not have the original bracket. After a few Months (maybe 1500 miles) the back tab broke off of the bracket and almost left me stranded. I ended up replacing it with a more expensive solid aluminum bracket that mounts to the front of the head and now I have no problems.
3,Disappointed in value,I was disappointed when I received this to determine that it was a small recipe book as I was expecting a larger size for the money.
4,"Decent, low-priced headphones","Low price, sufficient for computer lab headphones. Maybe not what I would buy for personal use, but good enough for a lab full of computers. Order was quickly processed and delivered."
4,Good movie,This movie was actually pretty good. I like watching different movies and to me this is a good one. Wish it was dubbed in English but it is not a big deal. The story was pretty good and funny. The robots were pretty cool too.
1,If they have to be covered by other singers...,"...wouldn't you want them to at least be remixed?This album doesn't quite fit the bill of a great dance/cover album. There are a few I like, such as Name and Runaround, but otherwise this just doesn't please me at all. The worst of the Sybersound Dance Mixes series IMO.The worst tracks on here are Mouth, I Want to Come Over, and You Learn, because they're only -slightly- remixed to the point where you can't even tell if they were.A very large lack of effort was put on here. Fortunately all the others after this got better. I know, because I purchased #2 first, then bought #3 before buying this one online.I would stick to #3 and #4... and maybe #2."
3,cool toy (especially for brown boys),"I don't think there's enough dolls and action figures of color out there in the world. I have some cousins who are Samoan and I know they would have loved this toy when they were younger. I think many boys described as ""brown"" would like this toy. Folk of other genders and melanin levels can enjoy it too.Militant rhetoric aside, I am a bit worried that little kids could eat and be hurt by the weapons that come with the toy. Perhaps parents should throw them away and just give the action figure to their youngster.I love how the Star Wars franchise makes toys of almost every character. I think it gives kids room to make up whether they want the toy to be a big part of their play or a small part. They can use their own imagination to determine if the doll will be a good guy or a villain.The actor that played Typho, btw, was hot! I hope he's excited that he has a toy out their in his image."
1,Horrible,"Cheap, uncomfortable (top folds into your toes and pinches/slices into the top of your toes/foot). Might be easier to move and run in a pair of ski (not snowboard) boots. Put your money towards a better pair."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The boots were what we should have expected for the money. I blame myself, this is not a high quallty pair of boots you are buying for less than half the cost. They are comparable to ones you would expect to find at Pay Less or Walmart for about the same money. I really wish they did not leave black marks on the floor though- very hard to get off. (Sorry, just being honest)"
3,Eh Price said it all,I bought this pair of boots to get me through an academy about a year and a half ago. They lasted but are not very practical. They aren't very comfortable or supportive. Also get VERY HOT in the sun. IDK why they say EMT because any EMT or Police officer in the summer working traffic or an accident...your feet will melt off! also about 6 months in the lining behind the tongue started to crack revealing the stuffing inside. They do shine very well though. better than most I've had. The toe is strong as well. I would recommend saving your money and getting a better pair that will last a few years more. Magnums perhaps.
4,Love this boot!,I have bought 2 pairs of these boots for my fiance for work. He love them. He wear a size 14 & they ALWAYS have his size in stock. They last a long time & he says they are very comfortable. These are worth the money.
5,Great Boots!,"Great Boots! I am not sure if the teen liked them or not because it was an Angel Tree (anonymous giver and receiver) gift for children of incarcertated parents. But, I loved them!"
1,Tactical boots,"I am so disappointed with this purchase. These boots were too big, hard, they fold up at the toe and now my legs are hurting after only wearing them twice. I should've listened to the negative reviews."
1,Uncomfortable and not durable,You get what you pay for. Within 6 months of issue from my employer the soles were falling off. The material covering the toe if the boot is so cheap it looks like I have been repeatedly kick a rock 8 hours a day for a year. The mesh sides have turned purple from sun exposure. Spend the extra money on the something durable like a Danner.
3,too big,I like the comfort and support but the size is one inch too big for what they tell you.I am too far away to do anything about that.
3,You Get What You Pay For,"These shoes didn't cost much, and there's reason: they're not worth much. I'm not saying they're bad, just Ok.These are the kind of leather shoes that always manage to look like vinyl (they're supposed to be leather); that don't quite ever break in properly; that grip, but not enough; that fit, but a bit clumsily; that aren't hot, just not comfortable. And The support is just all wrong. A six inch boot is problamatic to start with, so the collar (at the ankle) has to be made well: These are too wide, as is the last hieght inside the shoe, from the top of the toe to the top of the toe box, to the arch; just too roomy in all the wrong places, and my feet are dead average. I wear them, they look fine, but if I dont lace the last two lugs (from the arch to the ankle) outside, the collar will eat my ankles alive. In the end, I'm afraid they look and feel cheap."
1,Poor quality,"The boots are a waste of money, better off spending a little more and buying a pair of bates. The black coating peeles off the front and sides of the boots.."
1,"Joel did not like ""compilations""","Joel did not believe one could study The Infinite Way as an intellectual pursuit. Students were to take entire classes, the series of lectures and join in the consciousness of the class as it unfolded. He never combined classes by topic as Sinkler and others did. When he discovered that Sinkler did this, it was a great disappointment to him."
5,AWESOME!,"So, we just bought this TV last night, and I have to say, it looks incredible. The picture is so crisp and the colors are amazing. I watched LOTR with the 1080i up converter we also bought, and it looks better than it did in the theater. It's surprisingly light, but it will take two people to install it. THIS IS A GREAT TV FOR THE PRICE!"
2,Remote is terrible,"TV is good but the remote control is terrible. I changed the battery, move far / close to the TV, but I can only get sound and channel works. The remote is in good shape. The problem is the TV neglects all other remote control commands."
3,Good but not great.,"Satisfied with overall performance, cable is broadcast in 480I in my area so I didn't get the full benefit. When using the remote, the channels could have changed a little faster for me. DVD's looked really good. I had some problems with the right speaker. The speaker seemed to work intermittently. I sent it back to Amazon for replacement, but they didn't have one available."
2,Picture quality is not as clear and sound could be better,"Well, the only thing I have to say is that I'm really sorry that I did not repurchase the 42HDS69 like I originally had before it was stolen. I thought I would get the same quality of picture and sound from this model, but not the case. Believe me, the quality of picture on this model is not as crisp as it was on the 42HDS69. Also, someone told me that the volume/sound coming from the bottom speaker of the plasma tvs was suppose to be better than the volume/sound coming from the speakers on the side. Not true. I liked the sound from the side speakers better. I now have to add more speakers to this model to get the quality of sound I'm accustomed to. As for the poor quality of picture, I guess I'll have to live with that too or sell this one and purchase another one. In a nutshell, I'm truly disappointed with this purchase."
5,"My first HDTV, think I made a good decision","Really nice TV, especially for the price. Lot's of configurable options and the picture looks amazing...I don't have surround sound speakers yet but the built in audio for this TV sounds nice as well."
2,Cheap,I keep my smoker under covered deck -- completely out of weather -- and this cover ripped after 2 years
3,Faded within 2 months,"The cover is nice because it matches the Bradley smoker. Problem I had was it faded bad in 2 months. Did not take bright sun well at all. At least it did protect the smoker, it is just a cover anyway."
3,Bradley smoker cover,"Fits fine, but I would have liked to see a more weather proof type material instead of just nylon for what they charge for it."
3,Doesn't hold up well,"I purchased this cover almost a year ago. Where I live is extreme sun and heat in the summer and lots of snow and sub-freezing tempatures in the winter. The cover really fit well and held up good until winter. Now it is pretty ratty on top. Sides seem ok. I thing I can get another year out of it with a lot of duct tape for the top. I like the cover and the way it protects the smoker, just don't want to spend $30 a year."
1,Sun rotted in only two years,It sun rotted in only two years. It is made of a thin cheap material that does not hold up.
4,Good fit and durable,Bought this for my electric smoker which sits on my balcony through all kinds of weather. Seemed to endure the Colorado winter very well. I took it off today and there is are visible cracks or weathering. Should last me several years at least. Fits the smoker well.
2,needs improvement,"Love my Bradley!The cover not so much.As others have said,it fits great,but the material is inferior for the price.One year and the top is faded and flaking.If your storage area is out of direct sunlight it should last very well.I'll probably buy another,but I'll try and get a couple of more years by augmenting it with a garbage bag or tarp.Maybe by then they will have brought it up to the same quality as the smoker it is protecting."
5,Cool Luke,"I love this Luke! I whent shopping intending to buy AOTC figures but when I saw Luke, wow! He has great articulation and his hand will stick when you want it to, and it will cut off when you don't. However the paint rubs off his lightsaber. Also Hasbro continues messing things up with ""lightsaber attack action."" Which doesn't work very well. But it also doesn't get in the way as much as I thought it would. I thought Luke was great because he had so many accesories, such as, the blaster and holster, the bacta thing that goes on his hand, the pole he can hang from, and of coarse his lightsaber. Finaly, he also looks like Luke (which could be considerd a mericle.) I'd recomend this figure to both people looking for a toy and people looking for a colecter's item.P.S. Educational? Heck no! Unless you think learning about amputation by violent means is educational I would not recomend this to your local school."
4,Read the book - Enjoy the diet,"While the book might lack some details and explanations, the diet itself definitely works. I lost 10 pounds in 5 days and didn't suffer from any problems during that period or afterwards. I haven't regained any weight, I even lost another pound after I finished the diet. Having to buy a fairly high-priced protein powder might look like a marketing trick, but on the other hand you save money, because you don't eat as usual... And since the diet worked for me, I didn't really bother too much.PS: My father dieted for 7 days and lost 15 pounds, gaining only 2 pounds afterwards."
4,THE BEST DIET FOR ME!,"I've tried them all, this was just what I needed to get some pounds off fast. 12# in 11 days. I have more energy than being on diet pills. I'm female, 50 yrs. old, 5'3"", weighed 139# got down to 127# and will finish this two week program. After two weeks of normal eating I'll start up on The Turbo Protein Diet again for another two weeks or until I reach 115-120#. The $75.00 for two weeks is much less than what I would normally spend on food and drinks. The book makes sense to me, I drink the protein powder with fat-free milk and make my own broth. If I have a social function I drink a shake before going and always have a glass of water in my hand. There is nothing more motivating than getting on the scale everyday and seeing a weight loss. My thanks to all who wrote reviews, they really got me started and continue to keep me motivated."
1,You GOTTA be Kidding!,"How can they possibly tell you to start a diet on nothing but a laxative and a big tin of powder? (sounds like some could well be on their way to bulimia!) There's NO WAY this can be healthy for you, otherwise Doctors all over the WORLD Would be recommending it to you in some shape or form! (I'm on the Carb Addicts Diet, and have lost 12 lbs in 4 weeks so far! Much better usage of your money in my opinion!) I'd say try other methods before going to this extreme! I bet if you take this to your doctor before starting, they'll be sure to let you know what you are doing is more harm than good."
3,A Question....,I think this is for me... I haven't tried it yet. My problem with diets has always been hypoglycemia and migraines.Can anyone telll me if you have had any side affects like this?
1,Don't buy this book,"I agree with the reviewer from Virginia. This diet is horrible! And, as for the reviews being fixed - they are... I suggest the Sunzanne Sommers book- it is smart eating, I lost 4 lbs. in the first week without even noticing I was on a diet. The Atkins book is great but once you are off the diet you will gain weight because the carb. intake is too restrictive. If all else fails, excercise and drink plenty of COLD water- it works!"
1,Not for the long-term weight loss,"As a healthcare Professional and a woman who has fought weight since giving birth 12 years ago, I can tell you the only healthy way to get the weight off and feel good inside and out is to eat LOTS of fresh fruits and veggies, limit the meats and fats, and simply cut out the processed carbs and sugars and the dairy. There is plenty of calcium in those veggies. The only liquid we need is good ol' H2O and lots of it. We need to walk as much as possible for regular exercise. This book may be a quick fix for some but not for me. Man or woman does not live on protein alone. Our ancestors knew how to eat. Fruits, berries, nuts. We can learn a lot from ""Lucy""."
2,so now you have the book,"Maybe this is book is better than I rated it but since it is not very helpful about how/where to find the crucial ingredient of the diet, how could you know."
4,"Quick, Fast Results","This diet is absolutely phenomenal. It works exceptionally well, and I saw excellent results with it. All told, I lost 20 pounds with the diet, and the key point here is that I did not gain any of the weight back whatsoever. Even when I went back to my usually .... and very non-low carb diet. I give it 4 stars because I never did make it to the 2 week mark, it was just too hard for me, so I ended up doing this diet for 5 - up to 8 days at a time which is how I lost the sum total of 20 lbs. I must also mention that I am hypoglycemic, meaning my blood sugar drops fairly low, and this diet does cause your blood sugar to drop. This diet is not for the faint of heart and it can be very difficult. But if you are in a pinch, it is a great way to lose some extra pounds in a hurry!"
3,Ok,It way to much history of humans. I had to read all the way to the end before getting to where the actual diet plan.
5,Best Dieting Tool I Have Ever Used!,"I thought I had tried EVERYTHING before I read this book and started using the shakes. I have lost 9 pounds in 6 days. It really is amazing and you don't feel starved. I even performed an experiment of sorts. 4 days into the diet I ate a huge meal. Instead of leaping up on the scale 3 pounds and halting my progress entirely, the next day the scale was only up .75 pounds and I was able to continue losing .75 to 1 pound per day after this. This diet really works. Although, at certain points, it is obvious that the translation of the text from German could use a bit of work, the basic premise of the book holds true. You will lose weight!!! I am just sorry I didn't have this sooner."
2,Where to draw the line?,"The book explains the history and differences of the various branches of Judaism (Orthodox, Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, Humanistic and Polydox Judaism) and defines Open Judaism, which allows humanistic liberties within Judaic faith (a sort of customized Judaism). Its extreme liberalism is justified by acknowledging the state of religious diversity within contemporary Jewish society (""modern Jews are ultimately guided by their own consciences""). The writing is repetitious, and the part about Open Judaism lack the strength to convince the reader."
4,"Good Book - Good Morals, yet a realistic story of how it is to be a teen",This was a good book about life as a teen. There was even some romance - Teen Girls would enjoy the book!
3,Okay,"This toy is okay. The satelitte is very cool. However, Padme is tiny, and she can hardly stand up."
5,Padme' Coruscant Attack,I think this toy is alot of fun. Although I am a huge Star Wars fan and think every one of the figures are a five in fun. I have at least 75 of the Episode II basic figures and are all fun. This toy has gone through some rough times. It has still lasted. It is a five in durability. Educational value of this toy I also put a five because if you want to know about Padme you can learn alot about her by this toy.
2,Hard to watch,I saw this movie at the drive in when I was about 5 years old. Later as an adult I tried hard to find it but could not remeber the title. In my childhood memories I remebered this movie as grand entertainment. After years of searching on the internet I finally found out the title and bought it on Amazon. This movie tries hard to blend action with comedy. It does not work. Also the film score seems like it should be from another movie and it is very distracting. Okay but be warned.
2,"Nice Horses, but not much else","Bought this DVD (Amazons and Supermen) because I know one of the actresses.There is a tenuous plot, but the acting is at best so-so and I could barely make it to the end. We won't go into the special effects, such as they were. Regrettably, the director/producer had aspersions to fame and the ""ending"" clearly pointed to a sequel rather than terminating the movie. I don't know if there is a sequel, but free might be too expensive a price to pay for a copy of the sequel.The best I can say is that-- I've seen far far worse movies-- they used nice horses, and (for the most part) the actors/actresses could actually ride them.I give it a two star for the horses and riders, if you aren't a horse person this would be a less than one star event."
2,"Promising story, but...","This could be such a wonderful book. Heroes that met four years ago, were attracted to each other but were unable to establish a relationship. A tortured hero. A new chance four years later. A chance that is wasted in such a bad way. In the end, this is a story about two people who can't be together for five minutes without fighting, insulting and hurting each other. And all the time they are supposed to love each other. In words, but not in actions. They can't even be civil to each other. The story dragged on with no action and endless reflections. It was so boring I had to skip pages in order to finish it. Even in the end, when the misunderstandings were already resolved, they were still fighting. I just don't know how these two could possibly live together happily."
1,Distasteful relationship,"I generally like Balogh's work but this was a really unpleasant book. The main characters don't like each other and it is hard to believe that they are genuinely ""in love"" at any time. I found the behavior of the hero so negative that I could not believe that things were going to work out between the two in the end. It was like reading a clinical case study."
2,Disappointed,Have read almost all of Mary Balogh's books but found this one a little disappointing. James Purnell was not a likeable person and cannot understand why Lady Madeline pined for him for so many years. Ms. Balogh took a little too long for them to express their love for each other and by that time I was just glad to have the book finally over.
3,Only book I liked in the series,"Devil's Web was by far the best book in the ""Web"" Triology. I struggled with reading this book less then I did the first 2 books which absolutely bored me. At a point I get sick of the brooding male figure that lives with his silly guilt.If you decided to read any book in the ""Web"" Triology - only read this one."
2,Talk About Skipping Pages?!,"I can tell you I read about half the book and skimmed the rest. Jeesh, this wasn't even a romance. It was ridiculous how boring and unattractive these characters were...ugh! I say, ""Skip it."" I loved this authors Bedwyn's series...LOVED it. Lately though, any book of hers (even reissues) that I have happened to pick-up, have not even worth the full price purchase...hit the secondary market if you just have to read something from her but again, I generally will NOT pick-up one of her books. She had me hooked, then I read the books after the Bedwyn's and...blech!"
1,Just say no...,"Too bad I didn't read the reviews before I started the book. What a stinker. Look, I get the brooding hero, I even LIKE the brooding hero, but I've never liked STUPID brooding heroes. And the holes... Case in point: James and his father spent pages screeching about Dora ""the slut."" Gee, it would be nice to know how James resolved his feelings over the charge after he learned her story. But no. Then there was the whole ""She likes to fight. If there is nothing to fight, she gives in"" to explain Madeline's idiocy. What?? And the ending...just horrid. So obviously tacked on that I'm surprised the publisher didn't just insert a blank page beforehand. You know, it's sad when the only story I found interesting was that of Jean and Howard, especially given that he was supposedly the ""dull"" one."
2,Painful conclusion to a promising trilogy,"The third and final book in this trilogy, The Devil's Web had solid bones, but failed to live up to its potential. Focusing on the characters of Madelaine and James, first introduced inThe Gilded Web, Devil tries to reconcile the obsession and the hatred these two people feel for each other. Balogh tries to create passionate tension that moves back and forth between two people who can't talk about their feelings or even to each other without causing an argument. Unfortunately, she never seems to find her rhythm.In previous books, I've enjoyed Balogh's writing and her stories. The Devil's Web fails to live up to the standard I've come to expect when I pick up one of her books."
1,Depressing,"I enjoyed other series from Mary Balogh, but this one has been the worst, each of them incredibly depressing. And The Devil's Web was the worst of the lot. I actually just decided to stop reading it, about 80 pages from the end, because I can't bear how unendingly depressing it is. There aren't even any witty conversation or amusing moments interspersed.. it's just monotonously depressing."
1,The Unbelievable Heroine,"I have read most of Mary Balogh Books including those out-of-print ones that I buy second-hand often at great expense. I have never read about such an unbelievable heroine. After buying the book and reading the first couple of chapters I was determined not to waste. The urge to smack the heroine was strong. She was supposed to have been physically and mentally abused all her life but suddenly 2/3s into the book, she realises she loves her abusive father anyway. She yearns for freedom to the point that she would risk scandal and being ostracised just to be free - so unbelievable of a woman of that era. A gently-bred woman who was raised on the Bible had no business doing what she did in the end as well.Don't get me started on the hero! The only time I had an respect for him was when he lost his temper with the heroine - and that was past the halfway mark of the book. And he promptly apologises! Wuss."
3,I had to read it,"I had to read this book to find out what happens to James Purcell and oh my! This is by far the darkest love story I have read. However, Balough was brave enough to leave James' character intact. He had heavy baggage from his past that could not be easily erased and it took until the whole end of the story for him to come to peace with some of it. I did not feel the deep connection between the two character that I did in the previous book and felt the relationship was very one dimensional and combatative which really disturbed me, but Balough did not sacrifice the integrity of the story or the characters and plunged head long into it. Not sure I liked this one because I wasn't feeling it."
2,A little dreary,"Mary Balogh is a gifted writer, and one of her special gifts is the portrayal of deep, intense emotional turmoil within her main characters. To date I have read 5 or 6 other novels by Mary Balogh and enjoyed them all very much. ""The Devil's Web"" however was a disappointment. The emotional turmoil of the hero and heroine very quickly became tedious as they just go around and around in circles. It becomes a bit disbelievable after awhile - how can two such otherwise intelligent and charming individuals not eventually figure out how to communicate with each other?In some ways I found ""The Devil's Web"" to be very reminiscent of a later Balogh novel ""Slightly Dangerous"", which is a wonderful romance and where the complex characters are both intense and believable. Perhap ""The Devil's Web"" simply represents an early stage of the author's career where she was still pefecting her craft."
2,Not really a cardio workout!,"I recently purchased Calorie Knockout Extreme Cardio for Maximum Burn. You would think with a name like that it would actually be a cardio workout, but I was very disappointed to find that it wasn't. Every workout on it involved weightlifting. Not just light cardio weights, but actual strength moves. I alternate cardio and strength training, doing cardio on one day and strength/weight lifting on the next. I don't mind some cardio on my strength days, but don't like to do strength moves on my cardio days when I let my muscles rest. I have lots and lots of strength DVD's and not nearly enough cardio DVD'S for my cardio days. The title of this DVD and the description on the packaging was very misleading. I would not have purchased it if I had known it was not a true cardio workout. I was expecting it to be an actual cardio workout, similar to the Biggest Loser Cardio Max, which I like very much."
3,"Good workout, but Anna is TERRIBLE!!","I have done a lot of workout DVDs, and I have to say, Anna is by far the worst, and I mean WORST, instructor I have ever seen. She doesn't count down so you have no idea how many more of ie. jumping jacks you have to do. She just stops and goes into something new. She also tells you to watch Vinny and someone else for modifications, but she never introduces them in the beginning! You can clearly see who they are eventually, but it's all up to you.I only did the Circuit #1 with Anna, and even though Anna is TERRIBLE, the workout is pretty good. I did sweat. But since she's terrible, the workout is choppy and the transitions aren't smooth at all. I did like most of the exercises though, but be prepared, she goes quickly into new things without warning.I'll have to do Circuits #2 and #3 to get a full opinion, but so far, workouts are good, but Anna is bad."
2,Not up to par with other Bob videos,"Like other reviewers, I found Anna's segment to be sub-par. She doesn't cue well, is off-beat, and is NOT motivating at all. I was looking forward to this DVD, because kickboxing is usually a fun, fast-paced workout. Unfortunately (even though Bob and Dolvett were OK), I found this workout to be neither--it was boring and not that great of a workout (maybe because I was completley demotivated!). If you like kickboxing, stick with Tae Bo or Turbo Jam; this one just doesn't cut it. For a more intense workout, try Bob's Bootcamp DVD--much more fun and motivating(and a much better workout)"
3,I'd just buy a Jillian or Bob stand alone workout instead.,"I haven't really watched Biggest Loser since Jillian left, but I thought I would try this workout because it was suggested to me after I purchased Jillian's Extreme Shed and Shred. The workouts are way too short. 15 minutes just isn't long enough for me to get a good burn. The few episodes of BL that I saw part of Dolvett didn't really bother me, but on this DVD I found him a bit abrasive and annoying. His workout was ok. I honestly can't report on Anna's cause I didn't even bother to try it. Bob's workout is the best by a long shot. I wish the whole dvd was just him. The workouts felt choppy and disjointed. I didn't like the tabata style workout either. All and all there are much better exercise dvd's out there for less. Unless you like the novelty of working out with the shows contestants I would skip this one."
4,We bought two!,"I looked hard for a car seat for our daughter when she started to outgrow her baby seat. (Which was slightly before she was one year old- she has long legs!) I chose this one because it looked comfy, seemed to cover a wide age range, and wasn't too expensive. We've been using it now for nearly a year, and all three of us are happy with it. She falls asleep in it all the time, so I suppose it's pretty comfortable. :-) It was relatively easy to move the straps up to the next notch as she grew, and it's not hard to adjust the straps when she goes from coat to no-coat. It does not wiggle at all once it's in the car, either. The only drawback is that it's heavy and is tough to switch from one car to another due to a lack of handholds. However, since we'd be switching it every day (which is not my idea of a good time anyway) we simply went out and bought another."
2,"Difficult to adjust, can't replace parts","I bought this carseat a couple years ago to use with my first son. It held up well enough, but was very difficult to adjust and is also a very large carseat... if you have two carseats in the back seat of your vehicle, you will not be able to seat a third person. This wasn't an issue for us, but may be for some.My first son outgrew the seat and I moved my second son into it, and within a few weeks, the chest clip broke. Evenflo does sell a replacement chest clip, but due to the design of the seat, it is not actually replaceable... so I now have a 150 dollar carseat that is in every other way just fine, but is no longer usable because of an irreplaceable 5 dollar part. Thanks, Evenflo."
2,Evenflo Triumph Convertible Car Seat,"Don't buy this car seat. Overall it's a reasonably good car seat- my son was comfortable in it. However, if the chest clip breaks, you're out of luck and money. You can buy an Evenflo replacement clip but according to the company you can't replace the clip on this model."
1,hard to keep safe,"After spending a decent amount on this product, we are beyond disappointed. In fact, this seat causes us aggrevation every time we get into the car. The shoulder harnesses have not one, but two straps that are not both threaded through the chest clip. This means that each time we put our baby in the car, we have to try to adjust both straps as they overlap and are threaded through the same holes in the seat. One strap will be over the shoulder, while the other is halfway down her arm. Not only does it move every time we get her in and out of the car, but it is not easy to adjust. The knobs on the side are not easy to use and get caught and stuck. It is even worse when our baby goes from a thin shirt one car ride to a sweatshirt on another ride. We are going to ditch it and buy another seat as it is a hassle and ends up not being as safe as we want it to. We took it to a car seat safety check sponsored by our local police and they too said that it was poorly designed."
1,Frustrating and difficult to use!,"My husband and I picked this car seat because of the great reviews we read, but have had nothing but problems since day one! A friend of mine bought the delux version and had the same problems. It's difficult to install rear-facing. Even when we used LATCH it was hard to get the fabric cover back on. The straps are impossible to adjust rear-facing. Several times we have had our son in the seat correctly and snugly...but when we get to where we are going we'll notice that the straps have SLIPPED OFF OF HIS SHOULDERS! This is unacceptable and risks our son's safety. We have just ordered a Britax Marathon to replace this one. I can't wait to get rid of it!"
2,Great seat until you need to clean it,"The safety aspects of the seat are certainly positive and the harness adjustment process is not even nearly as difficult as some of the reviewers have mentioned.However, wait until your precious little one throws up in the seat or otherwise creates a big mess. You are going to need a screwdriver to take out six long screws to pull out the harness and then you can remove the seat cover, which is machine washable. This is per their manual and their website FAQ.This has got to be the dumbest design I have encountered in a baby product. Apparently, Evenflo is under the assumption that babies/toddlers are very neat and tidy all the time."
2,Chest clip broke and is not replaceable,"I was reasonably happy with this seat initially. However, the chest clip broke, and although Evenflo sells the identical clip, in this particular model it is NOT replaceable. I called Evenflo, and they verified it is not replaceable, and my carseat is now garbage. Evenflo failed to plan for the possibility that a cheap piece of plastic would break, and they will not do anything about it."
4,Very good seat,"I bought this seat because it had crash-test ratings comparable to the Britax at much less cost. It has been a great seat, although it is easier to adjust when forward facing compared with rear facing. It ahs been comforatble for my daughter. Getting the seat cover off is a pain but adjusting the height of the shoulder straps is really easy. We have a blue one and it looks good after 2 years of raisins & cheerios. It is a little wide and a little heavy, but we don't move it, we have a smaller Graco seat in the 2nd car that can be moved easily if needed or taken on a plane. Now we have to move the new baby into this seat and buy our 21/2 year old a combo booster, she is not big enough for a regular booster,therefore we should have just gone ahead and bought the Britax Marathon, that would have carried her through. But if you can keep your child in this seat until 40# then go to a regular booster, I would recommend it."
4,Good Item for the price,"This product does the job fine. For the money, you can't really beat it. Only one small problem with this switch. Sometimes, the buttons don't click in all of the way. For ex.: You may think that you selected button 3, but you may have to go back and press it again harder to select the equipment hooked up to that channel. Other than that, it's a good product."
1,Poor Company to work with,Bought a Guitar/Amp.They were packaged VERY poorly & items arrived to me ALREADY damaged. This co. has NO phone #.I e-mailed-told company the items were not in working condition & I HAD to return them. They did not answer many e-mails.They WOULD NOT pay for return shipping even though I could NOT use the broken items.Told co. I would give poor feedback or call the Better Business Bureau if they did not pay return shipping & they still did not pay. Poor Company to work with--Stay away !!!!!
3,"I like the exfoliation of this product, but ...","I like the exfoliation of this product, but the sponge didn't stay on the handle very well when I rubbed it with any effort. The handle itself is great, but the sponge didn't seem very long lasting and didn't make much lather. If you want something just for your back and not the rest of your body, this product would be great, but for all over body use, I'd choose something else."
3,"The handle's a great idea. The sponge, on ...","The handle's a great idea. The sponge, on the other hand, isn't the greatest. There's no way it'd last the 4-6 weeks that Buf-Puf states in the directions. The white side of the sponge has completely fallen apart in a week. But, before that happened, I thought it was a pretty good product. So, I wouldn't recommend this, nor would I buy it."
4,"Initially, I thought the Buf-Puf Body Sponge was ...","Initially, I thought the Buf-Puf Body Sponge was a little too harsh for my skin. But I got used to it during subsequent uses, and actually liked the slightly rough feel of it -- it felt like it really cleaned and smoothed the rough spots. All in all, I'd recommend this to family and friends."
2,Wasn't too impressed.,"The buf-puf was too hard on my skin. I gave it a try for an extended period of time before moving onto luffa, which in my opinion does a much better job of exfoliating than any synthetic material I have yet to try. I'm sure this works for some people, it just wasn't for me. I now used a luffa back scrubber that has suction cups which allows me to scrub my back in the shower better than any hand brush I have tried. Sorry everybody... I just don't like the material used with the buf-puf.I highly recommend the big bear luffa back scrubber for anybody with an itchy back. Maybe its not ""rough"" enough for some people, but for me it works beautifully. I have tried a lot of different products and wish I would have found this a long time ago. It would of saved me a lot of money and a lot of discomfort. That's my opinion for what's worth.The BIG BEAR - Bath and Body Natural Loofah Back Scrubber"
4,Mistake.,"Yes, So not only did the shipping and hadleing cost way to much, but for the same price, i could of gotten, somthing of better quality, and and even quicker delivery, I will never order from this company again, and if my friends ask where i got the cat, i will tell them, Well.. Not from here.. I have never been more disapointed with something that i have bought online."
1,this [stinks],- - - don't bother - not even as good as 3rd rate - - - who are the artists? lousy renditions of songs that mostly will be forgotten.Yuk
1,Huge Disappointment.,Not worth 49 cents. Save your money and buy something else ... anything else! Nameless performers offering mediocre versions of hits. Certainly not the way you remember hearing them originally.
3,Unsympathetic protagonist,"Sent to me by a family member as a recommended good read, I barely think it qualifies for three stars. The first section, narrated by the dead queen's spirit, was culturally and historically interesting. The second section, marked by a dry, removed narrator left me cold...cold to a learned but never profound and totally unsympathetic Babs Halliwell."
3,Opens the Door,"Although I first bought the book for it's cover (a Korean courtesan on a swing) reading this book opened the door for me onto Korean Literature, history and culture. I have since read ""The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyong: The Autobiographical Writings of a Crown Princess of Eighteenth Century Korea"" as translated by JaHyun Kim Haboush. (This is the same translation that Babs Halliwell/Margaret Drabble reads)and `The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Korean Poetry by Peter H. Lee and ""Introduction to Korean History and Culture"" by Andrew C. Nahm. I recommend all three for those who like me have become as fascinated by Korea as I was.I subtracted two stars due to the more mundane story of Babs Halliwell, which seems dull in comparison to the high drama and politics of 18th Century Korea. I found myself skipping over Babs Halliwell interludes eager to get back into the real story."
3,Interesting read but not a book you couldn't put down.,The book starts off very interesting as a 18th century Korean Princess narrates her life story. How she became married to Korea's nortriously famous Prince Sado whose mental illness caused great suffering to himself and others. Then the story loses momentum as it moves to present day and centers around the life of Barbra Halliwell a Proffessor on her way to a conference in Korea.The first part of the book I really enjoyed the second half was simply not as interesting. It was exciting to learn more about Korea's Royal family.
2,Not Engrossing,"I started reading this book slowly - and I admit that I jumped over huge paragraphs that just seemed to be repetitious. The first half of the book had a lot of repetition and building up or scenes, which I found annoying. As I'm about to start the second half I just hope that the new narrator will have a different manner of expression.... or it will be a real challenge to finish this book."
1,sounded interesting but.....,"As someone who is fascinated by Korean history and culture, I couldn't wait to read this book . It sounded so interesting, and was in fact in the first half which recounted Price Sado's time in Korean history. Once the second half started, it became a total bore, and before long I had to put it down. I just couldn't read anymore. How can a writer go from a story of historical intrigue to never-ending rambling about a boring medical conference she's attending in Korea.Don't bother."
2,Not impressed,"I found this book on a list of 100 books to read before you die, found the plot captivating and was terribly disappointed. I found the first part of the book (about the red queen) interesting, although not well written. The second ""modern"" portion was dull and predictable. I found I had to force myself to finish it and was not satisfied when I did. Would not waste your time."
2,random tangents,"I was pretty disappointed with this novel and started skimming about 25 pages in. Talk about random tangents and disconnected thoughts - Ms. Drabble hardly ever finishes a thought concisely. She jumps around all over the places, and you will have forgotten what she started talking about by the time she finishes. Nothing is described in enough detail, no emotion is fully developed and no character can truly be realized."
5,Good content supported by extensive examples.,"This is the most ""readable"" book on graphic design for desktop publishing that I own. This book assumes you are already familiar with your software. Examples are outstanding; often the same text & graphic elements are presented in a variety of ways. Content is concise and simple, and directed at the intermediate to advanced user. The first half of the book deals with elements of design; the second half incorporates that info with special pointers for newsletters, ads, brochures, catalogs, letterheads, reports, resumes, forms, business cards, etc. My favorite chapter was ""Common Design Pitfalls"", followed by a chapter of redesigns."
3,A book for REAL BEGINNERS,"Well, it is a good book, full of sound and useful basic advice - but if you have some practical experience with design for print, you may be exceptionally bored and you may also get angry, because the author always seems to stop just where you want more information - o.k., this may be quite normal given this format, anyway, bewarned."
4,A Good Second Book on Design,"Once you've covered first base with the ""Non-Designers Design Book"" you are well equipped to start reading this book. Since this book also covers the basics (though not as well I find), you could also decide to skip ahead and go directly to second base.Here you'll also learn about managing grid systems, white space management, basic text composition and the effective use of fonts and illustration. The last sections of the book applies your new found knowledge to the design of various types of documents. Finally, in the last section is a hoge-poge of trap to avoid (the counter examples if you like).A book well worth the money (all books are cheap compared to IT books ;-)"
2,If You Only Have One,"On the cover of this fine book is a blurb from the NY Times saying ""If you have only enough money for one DTP book, buy this one,"" paraphrased, of course. The emphasis should be if you only have ONE. If you have any of Robin Williams' books or a Classroom in a Book, Parker's book will only be a re-hash of that. So, if you don't have a good DTP book, this is the book for you. If you have anyother reasonably good DTP book, this will just be the same stuff."
2,Beginner's Material,"There is little depth to this text. However, It might be a fine introductory selection for someone who knows little to nothing about the subject. For those better versed, skip it.One annoying thing about the book is: The design in the book itself is lame. It also deals with sample design solution that are, you guessed it, lame.This book is the ideal choice of a local newsletter layout-master."
1,Looking crap in print,"Would be a better title. How one can call this the `definitive guide to desktop publishing and design` is beyond me and should be arrested by the anti-idioten brigade. The lay-out itself is crap, the examples crappier. The content is everything but in-dept and outdated (even for the novice). That the writer doesn't mention anything about PDF says enough.A far better book on graphic design and desktop publishing would be: The New Graphic Design School by Alan Swann & David Dabner.(ISBN: 0471686832). It`s not an all-in-one DTP guide like Roger`s book is supposed to be but what it covers is far more interesting and up to date than what you can find here.Not recommended."
5,wow!,shaak ti the jedi you cant pronounce. yet is a great action figure no jango fett but still awesome
4,Good for collection,"This figure has not only expanded my small collectio of Episode II figures, it also makes it more noble for the Jedi. I've noticed that almost all the male Jedi Masters have simple tunics as their chosen garb. Shaak Ti, however has put a more regal touch to it. Put alongside other Jedi, she seems a bit more deadly and powerful given a skirmish between her and any other Jedi."
3,Shaak Ti sounds like a karate word...,"Shaak Ti!! Sounds like something a martial artist would say while executing a karate chop. Anyway, it's always nice to see more female Jedi being immortalized as an action figure, like Luminara Unduli and Adi Gallia. Shaak Ti is a new member of the Jedi Council in EpII, and very appealing to the eye. She features a red face with white lips and raccoon-striped head-tails. As with Nikto and Luminara, I was kinda let down by the lack of poseability in this figure. Her rubbery arms move and her head moves a little bit, and that's it. She has a blue lightsaber with a clip-on blaster deflection effect. The paint job on this figure is superb, which is the main reason I decided to get it, and she can also hold her lighsaber with both hands. Overall, Shaak Ti is a nice figure, but it would have been nice to have a little more poseability. As with Nikto and Luminara, Shaak Ti is another one of those figures that looks great as a display, and not for play."
4,jedi,"This toy is pretty good, but not really for playing. She has great detail, one of the best in detail so far. She has 3 points of articulation: her hands, arms, and head. If you put her lightsaber in her hands and move them up and down, it looks like she's cutting something in two. Though you might not want her, you still need her if you wish to recreate the battle arena (and you'll also need the other jedi that are coming out; I wish Hasbro would hurry up so I can recreate the battle arena scene)."
3,o.k. figure,this figure is o.k. the problem is that her blue lightsaber blade falls off easily so its not much fun. but this toy is good overall. i like the way she is posed.
2,Shaak Ti Jedi Master--by Mason,"Unlike my other Episode II figures, Shaak Ti is not that cool. Her blue lightsaber blade broke off the handle and I had to tape it back on. But this toy has the best durability in my collection. It looks like she's wearing some sort of African mask with long and big pieces of hair sticking down. You can use Shaak Ti's blast effect and attach it to the saber and deflect blaster shots--great with Jango Fett and Zam Wesell."
4,At least shes a gurl!,"Not much poseability on this one. Seems that most of these new toys cater to the collector. Collector's keep em in the package! It was nice when Adi Gallia came out. She was more flexible than Shaak Ti. Still, she looks great! Very erotic looking gal! In an alien kinda way. So, not much fun for you grown-ups who still play with these figures because she is such a stiff, at least she's a gurl!"
1,Zero tutorials with Divided Nation,"Lack of tutorials with this game make it a real bummer to try and learn. Still haven't played it, trying to plow thru the manual."
3,First Revue,"Good game. Runs a little rough. Example- Press any key to start. Have to repeatedly press several keys. Look up, same thing. Back to me, same thing."
5,cool man,"this jango figure is cool.second best jango [kamino escape one is best].bot the REMOVABLE head is very cool.unlike anakin figure the magnet is strong.firing gauntlet is kinda cool.jetpack a bit small.blasters too.legs and arms are good too.quite durable.ok in water but if head comes off in water not good.educational references to complex armour,weaponry and the sport of bounty hunting.if this is helpful to you please check my review of the other jango fett figures.also my review of the boba fett and mace windu figures and my slave 1 review.on the whole if you see this figure BUY IT!"
5,Jango from the final few moments he is in,"This Jango is kinda cool. He has his dual blaster pistols, but they don't have a holder to stick them in (like Kamino Escape). He comes with the flame thrower, and if you pull it back in his arm it will launch like a rocket. His jetpack can come off, and you could even put Boba Fetts on if you'd like. His head can come off, and is held on with a magnet. He can bend his arms, his right elbow, and his legs. His knee caps can bend and swivel as well. Overall, I like this Jango Fett figure better then the other 3 I own, even if he can't holster his pistols."
5,Better than the rest?,"This Jango Fett Is very cool.However,I found him very hard to stand up and I wish his holsters worked.His gauntlet seemed way oversized.I was hoping the flame would be more realistic and stay in his gauntlet.Improved articulation makes him great to pose.And I love his jetpack.I wish his left arm would have been articulated at the elbow like the Kamino Escape Jango Fetts.Overall I would rate him second best with the Kamino Escape Jango Fett being the best.Before you buy this one I suggest seeing if the Kamino Escape one is available first."
5,"Really great, and a great price.","Got this for my 8 year old star wars fan. This is a very detailed book, he spends time reviewing the pages and matching them up with the toys and the movie. It's a large book and the majority of each page is covered with pictures of the vehicles."
4,A good book...if you're into that sort of thing like me,I wouldn't call this the greatest technical book of all times. I wouldn't be suprised if this book wasn't nominated for any kind of award. But Episode 1: Incredible Cross-sections is captivating enough to stand on its own. I enjoyed it because I got to look through the insides of some of the film's most enigmatic ships and vessels like Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator and the Gungan Bongo. It's good for those who were still puzzled about the ships after the end of the film.
5,It helps you under stand EVERY ship in the movie.,My favorites are the details on the droid's ships. I LOVE THE MTT(Troop transport). This is one of the BEST references you can have for Ep1.
5,Getting Mauled...,"Ok, like most I was skeptical about ANOTHER Darth Maul figure coming out but when the figure actually arrived it was a different story. The new scupt is very detailed and really great. His pose is a little funny and doesn't lend itself to much articulation but that's more than made up for by his moving arm, which both raises and lowers, as well as spins the light sabre. Major drawback -> Hasbro has relied on the magnet to hold the light sabre in place and I don't think this is enough. A tighter grip of his hand might have done more than the magnet to keep him from fliging the light sabre. All in all, a cool toy and the drawbacks are fairly minor."
2,"Not elementary, not globally focused","This book purports to be elementary and easy to understand. It also claims to introduce the reader to global finance. In fact, it does neither particularly well.The language is unnecessarily ponderous and unclear, which is a shame. Finance doesn't need to be so academic, boring and confusing. The author does little to welcome neophytes into the financial world, and a lack of interesting visuals and examples doesn't help matters.Furthermore, much of the book's focus is on generic markets (stocks, futures, etc.), rather than on global (overseas) markets. And so there isn't enough attention to the characteristics and peculiarities of foreign markets. Similarly, the major topics of global finance, that one might reasonably expect to be the meat of such a titled book, are mostly left to just one chapter (Global Finance) of 24 pages!The book just doesn't fit the bill of a good introduction to global finance."
3,Look before you buy,Covers writing T-SQL and C# code to be executed/hosted within SQL Server. The authors point out many of the new features of SQL Server 2005.I found the writing style somewhat disjointed. I just couldn't read it from cover to cover. It reads like a course syllabus. It doesn't really fall into the category of a reference either.Make sure you skim through this book at your local bookstore before you commit to purchasing it.
3,Good brevity - poor flow,"As other reviewers have stated, there is good coverage of topics overall and in new topics in particular. The sentence structure and overall material arrangement are, however, suboptimal. I have used this text as a survey of new features and to get a view of the SQL Server development landscape. I would not recommend any heavy lifting with this text. I would recommend the Inside Series for that."
1,Pugs not interested.,My two pugs are major rawhide/bone/pig ear fans but for some reason they aren't too interested in these chews. One will eat it once he realizes he's not getting anything else and the other doesn't even bother with it.
4,"Aveeno Regular Bath Treatment for Itchy, Irritated Skin ...","Aveeno Regular Bath Treatment for Itchy, Irritated Skin feels great on my skin, which is normally quite dry. It soothed my skin and seems to lessen reddish areas. I'd definitely buy this product again."
5,Miniature masterpieces.,"I found this book to be an absolute delight. The illustrations are exquisite and Margaret Doherty's conversational style is easy to read and understand. I learned a lot of new techniques, for instance, using parts of a large scale fabric to piece a very small bird. In one instance, she used a cobblestone fabric for the birds breast.I am interested in developing small projects and feel that any one of the 40 squares would make a masterpiece item.A quote from the author's preface: ""I work as a pediatrician and each night after dinner, I do a crossword puzzle and sew for about six hours."" sums up the author's approach to this form of fabric work. The challenge in looking at fabrics, colors, and techniques in a new way is worth the price of the book."
5,Eye candy and inspiration for years to come,"Plan on taking this book off of the shelf whenever you want a little inspiration for another quilt. This quilt is truly an heirloom - not one you're going to sleep under. The quilt itself will take your breath away and, hopefully, you'll be inspired to try some of the techniques, even if you aren't as ambitious as Docherty is. I went right out and bought some new fat quarters of fabric that I thought might do for some of the squares, using her approach to choosing fabric, and will start small, with only one block. Her innotative techniques and exquisite results make her both an artist and a skilled artisan. Her writing style make her an excellent teacher. Don't pass this one by."
3,ok songs,"i got this cd for my mom but found that it wasn't that interesting for me (13 boy) but my mom loved it so, boys avoid it moms, get it. My mom said it has good tune and everything like that."
1,Mermorex Discs for Sony Mavica 400,"Not being able to find the Sony 156 meg CD-R discs which worked flawlesly with my camera (MVC-CD400)I purchased the Memorex discs. First problem was the very short ""initialize time"" with these discs. Second when the camera is turned on the first message is ""Sony discs work best"". Third the battery icon does not function properly.(the battery was fully charged)I took about 15 pictures (2270 x 2270) indoor and outdoor and the quality was terrible. Finalizing the disc appeared normal and viewing in the computer most of the pictures were underexposed with colors way off expecially the greens. The Contrast was also off. Of course this made me very unhappy because I would get great pictures with the Sony discs. Now I suppose this camera is good for the junk heap. Original cost was $753.00.JJK"
5,De lo Mejor,Son Excelentes. Sobre todo por su tamaño. Lo unico malo es que les son dificiles de conseguir las cajas o los sobres.
4,Glad to find these,We needed some mini discs for our camera.I was pleased to find what I wanted at a good price.
2,Depends on which camera you use,"I have 2 of the CD-Mavica cameras. The CD-1000 uses these disks fine with no problems. However with the CD-500, about 2/3 of the disks have problems. I know it is not my camera causing this problem, I know several people with the same camera that have the same problem. If you have a CD-500, use the TDK brand disks, I have not had a problem with any of them."
4,camera disks,"My old sony used these. They were pretty good, but the newer cameras and flash dives are better and more convenient"
2,Ehh,"I have combination skin, and I mainly break out in my t-zone. The skin there usually gets very dry and flaky with the use of acne prodcuts and various other things such as the winter air. I used this product in order to moisturize without having to worry about break-outs and I was disappointed. The product did not really moisturize my face for more than 10 minutes. I find the clinque lotion far better to moisturize and this is allergly tested and totally fragrance free and it doesn't clog my pore"
2,Burned my skin,I used this item for the 1st time today.It went on nicely but actually made my skin feel dry and my face is burning.I put it on about 10 mins ago and its still burning. :(I will be returning this item.
2,Eh..So-So..,It has sylisic Acid in it..It's really hard on your skin. My Skin was in horrible shape after I used this..
1,acne fighting moisturizer that doesn't fight acne or moisturize,"I bought this because I have combination oily and dry skin while suffering from acne. I wanted a moisturizer for my noise which gets dry and flaky that wouldn't be too heavy and wouldn't aggravate my acne. This product didn't help the dryness at all. After reading the back, it actually says it may cause dryness and peeling. It also seemed to aggravate my acne. I use other medications prescribed by a dermatologist, so I don't know if the interaction with the other creams may have caused the extra break out, or if it was this moisturizer. Either way, I will not be using this product any longer."
4,One of the best,"I was in serious need of moisturizer for my face and this just happened to be on sale. I break out on a regular basis once a month it gets really bad. This product isperfect for both! It leaves a nice tingly feeling on the skin (refreshing not at all burning.)It does not have sunscreen in it, but sunscreen is skin protectant and this is a MOISTURIZER. If your face is brutally dry I would go with somthing a bit heavier as this is light, totally worth the money. I actually look forward to washing my face at the end of the day just so i can put it on."
5,"Excellent moisturizer, not much acne treatment","The lotion absorbs into skin very quickly with no greasy residue. It leaves a bit of a refreshing, tingly sensation when used directly after a shower. I have combination skin (dry cheeks, oily forehead and chin). It made me break out on my forehead after four days of use, but when I stopped applying it to the area, the zits cleared up within two days. I haven't noticed a huge improvement in overall acne, but my skin definitely looks fresher and softer. I would absolutely buy this product again"
2,Not Everything It Claims To Be,"I wouldn't use this moisturizer if you're looking to take care of dry skin on your face... the only thing it is good for is if you want to put a moisturizer on before makeup. In no way does it ""Moisturize all day long"" like the bottle says."
3,good performances but elderly sound,"Guido Cantelli died aged 36 in a plane crash in 1956. He was a great musical talent and was regarded as the possible ""successor"" to Toscanini. These Debussy performances attest to his conductorial skills; the Philharmonia Orchestra deliver highly desirable results in this repertiore. Ultimately however I would not recommend this disc unless you are an avid Cantelli fan.My reservations are based on the following reasons. Firstly while the performances are good, they are not that special and memorable. There are better versions available -Karajan/DG for La Mer or even better an extraordinary Abbado/Lucerne performance on DVD. Haitink is better in the Nocturnes (all 3)with crystal clear Phillips sound. Secondly the mono sound, while clear, is elderly and restricted in range.I note that the same recordings are available on Testament at a far higher price. I see no reason to opt for that option given EMI's much more reasonable costing."
1,STINKS!!!!!!!!!!,"This toy stinks. The only reason i gave it all one's is because you can't give it zeros. I went out and bought this toys at toys r us and it looked really cool in the box so i decided to buy it along with R2-D2. When i got home and started to play with it her body would not move an inch. The only good thing about this figure is the lightsaber that i gave to another jedi, I gave Undili to my dog. I don't understand why this figure is so rare, they didn't even show her in the movie. If your a dumb ... collector buy that always gets the rare toys before some of us kids do, then ...buy it. My fellow friends taht enjoy playing with them and at least take it out of the box dont waist that good Birthday money."
3,camera,"This was my first digital camera. At the time, the price was great! I have used it over and over. My main complaint is the viewing window is too small. In the future I would choose a camera with a much larger window."
5,Fun & easy!,Rush Hour Spanish is a great way to begin learning Spanish. Especially if you like to sing! My husband and I used this before living in Spain for a year and it helped so much with the basics. You won't become fluent but you learn a lot of useful things that you will use daily. We liked it so much we bought the one for Italian before going there.
5,Fun!,"I love this CD! It is a bit cheesy, but that's what makes it so much fun. I find myself singing the songs at work and giving my coworkers a bit of a laugh. My 5 year old is picking it up right along with me as I drive him to school in the mornings. Things that I've tried to learn before are actually sticking with this."
3,"One time through won't do it, but repeats help.","I wanted to learn Spanish and this seemed like a good place to start. Yes, it's a little corny at times in the ""story"" going on, but it DOES manage to teach basic words and a few phrases. Some of the songs are a little annoying, but they get the point across.This is probably great as a supplement to a more detailed course, but not so much as a stand-alone product. They go at a pretty quick pace, and many words are pronounced once quickly before they expect you to be able to pick up on it. Still, this is trying to get you a lot of info in a short amount of time, so I suppose it accomplishes that."
2,Berlitz Rush Hour Express,"I found it sounds too much like a bad Soap Opera, which made it difficult for me to pay attention."
1,Mine's in the Goodwill Box,"This CD is just too stupid to listen to. I went through it twice over a couple days during my commute to work, trying to be open minded since I spent $25.00, but found it to be beyond my tolerance no matter how much I want to learn Spanish. It is so lame I felt emabarrassed for myself in my car. Think cloyingly cheesy, as in the worst '70s variety shows you can think of and magnify that by 10. Purchasing it was entirely a waste of my money."
2,Space rock?,"I hate to be the first person to review this and give it a bad rating but this just did not impress. I bought this because I read somewhere that this was the best of the Ohio Space rock scene had to offer.Intrigued to hear what space rock was, I got this CD and now know that Space Rock is wanna-be pop with uncreative use of ""space type"" noises. Except for ""At the Arcade"", no song merits more than the initial listen.For those in LA, Amoeba Music wouldn't even take it when I tried to get a buck back for it. You will be looking at your watch after song seven. Two stars only because I only reserve one star for Ex-Models and their horrid 'math rock' (believe it or not this is a genre). I'm done with anything where only five bands can be identified to make up a whole genre!"
3,Nice pictures - not terribly deep,"This is a good book for basic information about cats, without getting too deep. The pictures are very nice, making it an easy read. I found myself reading it hungrily, but now need more substance. I'll probably try to give this book away now."
2,Jedi Master Will,"One of my favorite characters, overall...However, the figure for strictly display value is pretty weak...I hate to say it, I really do..I dont use the blast effect(it's a bit too cheesy), and he has no bolts to deflect. I just have him displayed standing there, thats all..Dont get me wrong, you NEED TO GET THIS FIGURE, but all-in-all, he's pretty weak..Sorry to dissapoint everyone..But still get it, if you collect.."
5,Not Too Shabby!,"Plo Koon is one of my favorite aotc action figures, he's amazing.I think it is really cool to have a jedi who has not much of a past, and you can re-create his life and any battles he may have had. He's perfectly designed for my likeing (not to flexable but not too stiff either), and I love his lightsaber and force power. As you'll see, I give all of my toys 5 stars for education, all the time. This is beacause I feel playing with toys and using your imagination is a very important thing, and no matter how old you are, you should always do this.Plo Koon is the coolest!Not too Shabby! (as a matter a fact, not shabby at all)"
3,Nice but.....,"I bought this blanket for my son because it was versitile. After washing it the 1st time, it lost it's shape. I have tried to pull it back into shape but I can still tell that the filling inside has bunched up. Other than that, it's still a great blanket."
5,Don't Judge This Book by the Cover; The Story's Excellent!!,"I picked the book up on a Thursday and finished it by the weekend. I would have finished it sooner, but I was savoring every word. Seriously! I don't generally like suspense thrillers, but I was bowled over by how well Patterson crafted the plot lines. Incredible attention to detail. His real places and settings really draws the reader in... as if the author had visited every site in the book. His own knowledge as a trial lawyer adds even more realism to the plot.A definite contender to become a feature film.The only flaw is the cover. It does nothing to capture the passion and intrigue in the book. It definitely pays to read the inside pages.It's a very satisfying, unpredictable ending.Can't wait to see the next book from this author!!"
1,"A poorly written, most uninteresting plotline","I can not remember the last time I read something as uninteresting as this book. The dialogue is flat, the characters are one dimensional, and you can see everything coming a mile away. I did not feel for the characters, nor did I like them. I was hoping for some medical history on fertility treatments but I guess that would have been too much work. I could skip page after page and still be informed. A waste of time and paper."
4,Gluten-Free for Babies,"We got these for our 8-month-old. Most babies her age eat Cheerios, but since celiac disease runs in the family we've decided to not introduce gluten into her diet. Oats may be an issue for celiac, so Cheerios were out. PerkyOs were just about the only GF option we found.As a GF substitute for Cheerios, they are fine. The baby has come to enjoy them.Would I eat them as an adult who is not avoiding gluten? Nope. The texture and taste is not particularly good. But they're fine for what they are........ good finger food for an infant avoiding allergens."
1,Is it really GF?,We were miffed to find in the small print that this is made in a plant that also processes wheat. We do not consider that gluten free and it will not be eaten by us. Sorry.
5,Great book about yourself,"This book will teach you that you have the power to change your life and take control of it. It will help you discover how to take away your ""ego"" that controls you and brings chaos to your life. This book is a book to discover yourself and your potential."

1,BE CAREFUL,"I have purchased 2 different Applecare products from ""markets"" thru Amazon recently and Apple refused to accept the registration saying they will only process Apple Reseller items. The fact that Amazon is a reseller didn't work. I got my money back but was really annoyed with Apple.I know many people who bought Applecare thru Ebay in the past. I guess that is what prompted Apple to take this action."
2,falls off,"I got this because my 2 year old kept emptying the fridge making items go bad...At first it worked great. Then, it started falling off. The sticky parts stay stuck to the fridge, but the strap falls off the sticky part all the time. It is easy to use, but since the plastic strap falls off the sticky part, it makes it kinda useless."
2,Doesn't work,"I bought two of these to keep my one year old out of the fridge. It didn't stop her- she just pulled real hard and the adhesive came loose on both of them. None of my other kids tried to get in the fridge but this one is a busy-body! I would expect something that is advertised to help keep children out of things would keeep a one year out of the fridge. The adhesive doesn't work well enough. I was on amazon.com looking for a different one when I noticed this one and thought ""I have to say something so noone else will make this mistake."" Maybe it would work for a child who is not as determined as mine is but I wouldn't chance it."
2,My 2 year old figured it out,"This worked for one of my children in the past, so I bought another one now that I have a 2 year old who is constantly getting into the fridge. He ripped it off the sticky part the first day. I reattached it and it worked for about a week until he figured out how to push the button and unlock it. Too easy to unlock and doesn't stick well."
3,Safety Latch,"I gave this product 3 stars because some of them seem to last while others do not stick at all :-( It is frustrating. I have even tried to super glue the latches onto the areas where needed. The super glue does not even hold them on. Oh well, I will keep trying to find a better safety latch."
3,appliance latch purchased from Amazon.,I am not sure if I really have enough to say about this product to make a twenty word review. I have only used one of the latches so far. What I did find ( so far at least ) is this--- the adhesive that is supposed to attach the latches is not good enough. I finally used epoxy adhesiveto fasten them in place. Time will tell if they last after continued use.
4,This is the best solution....,"Should I start off that both my latches broke this past year? Or should I start off saying that I bought two latches for our freezer chest to keep the lid shut tight, and that they lasted 10 years and broke on my fifth child? The durability of these latches are very good and I am about to buy two new ones of this same type, after first trying the junky cheaply constructed refrigerator latches of the Babies R Us brand. Only buy these ""Safety 1st"" latches IMHO!"
4,great toilet lock,"I tried several types of toilet locks and these work best for me. The only down side is that the adhesive doesn't stay for more than 3 months on 2 of my 3 toilets. On the newest one (the remodeled bathroom with low flow)I have had the same lock for close to a year. The old (1960s) toilets release the adhesive for some reason. Overall, these are the best, especially considering the price!"
1,just pointless,"I was so excited to try this lock on my dishwasher that my 17 month old son just loves to open and mess with. First, the original adhesive wasn't powerful enough. Fine. I tried Gorilla Glue, still wouldn't hold. I roughed up the end to be attached with a razor, thinking that it was the slick surface that made the glue not stick. Well, let's just say that several other adhesive ideas later I finally admitted defeat. Aside from just screwing the darned thing into the appliance, this will NOT hold against a firm tug. This product is junk."
3,Limited Range of Use,"I bought a few of these for different applications: knife drawer, refrigerator, holding a screen to the wall. This product only worked on the knife drawer. If you have two smooth, flat surfaces that are almost touching, it'll work fine. Otherwise, you'll need another product."
1,Utter Crap,this tired little piece of junk endured a mere 2 days versus the overwhelming might of a 2-year-old. caveat emptor.
1,Not Worth It,"It had a horrible smell. Does not stick well , and leaves residue behind. Luckily I was able to remove the residue without ruining anything. Don't Buy"
1,Doesn't Stick,"I bought this to act as a safety latch for our chest freezer in the dining room, next to the kids' playroom. I stuck it on the freezer and it popped off within minutes."
2,I did see a small difference as far ...,"I did see a small difference as far as helping to clear my skin up, but I was left with dry flaky spots. The cream really dried me out. It also felt like I was wearing a mask, as the cream is somewhat heavy. In comparison to other vanishing creams and acne medications, though, this is the only one I've used that seemed to make a difference in the amount of clogged pores I had. I'd use it again but would really like to use it without getting the dry spots. Also, it wasn't quite invisible. It left a chalky layer on my skin while I was wearing it."
2,Didn't work for me,"This 10% benzoyl peroxide treatment is no miracle. If you have the occasional pimple, it should work in drying out the pimple, then your face will naturally heal. Unfortunately, for those of us chronic acne sufferers, this won't work. It's way too drying and harsh, and it'll only bring out more pimples if applied improperly. For us, a multi-step treatment like Klear Action (a Pro Activ knockoff) is the only way to get those nasty pimples under control even if not banished."
3,I haven't tried this product for several years ...,"I haven't tried this product for several years and I was surprised to find out that it does seem to work a little better than I remember from my teen years! I liked that it dries fast but it seemed to be a little overly drying for my current needs. I'd probably recommend it to friends and family, especially teens."
3,"This is a good product, but a little ...","This is a good product, but a little too drying for my skin. It would probably work best for someone with very oily skin. Mine is oily, but I only have occasional breakouts. I liked that a little went a long way and the amount of the medication was very generous for the price. Definitely worth the money and I'd recommend it to someone with very oily skin."
4,"Used as directed, Clearasil Acne Fighting Cream works ...","Used as directed, Clearasil Acne Fighting Cream works great. I particularly like how in almost one week the pimple would practically be invisible. I've always used Oxy 10 in the past but I've never had such good results from another product. I'd strongly recommend this product for anyone who has occasional blemishes."
4,hmm. . .seems to be doing SOMETHING!,"well, I only bought this product about five nights ago, so I can't say anything remarkably good about it. It seems to absorb oil on my face, which is a good thing. But in the morning, I was very flaky. I think that was the gel sloughing off the dead skin cells, so I suppose it's working. I haven't seen much of an improvement so far, but that's because I haven't been using it for very long. I believe it's going to work though. I shall just have to wait and see what happens. This review isn't very helpful is it? hehehe."
4,Some improvement over time,"I purchased this product after in was recommend as a good BHA for exfoliation in the book Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me. I had been becoming extremely frustrated with my oily skin and frequent breakouts, so I was ready to try something new. For the past 1 1/2 months, I have been religiously using this product prior to bed and Neutrogena's On the Spot Acne Treatment (2.5% benzoyl peroxide) in the morning. While I haven't seen miraculous results, I have had a reduction in breakouts, and my skin texture seems to be slowly improving. In addition, I am no longer getting the dry, flaky patches which I was getting with other products. However, my skin is still oily, and I do still experience the occasional breakout. While this product certainly might provide you with some benefits, don't expect the near-immediate changes promised on the box."
1,Really Really Bad,"This figure was really really dissappointing. It barely moves at all. You can only fit the lightsaber in one hand. The face is all scrunched up, so it looks really [messed] up..."
5,shaft with a lightsaber,this figure is pretty sweet. he comes with his purple lightsaber which i think looks cool. it took me awhile to find this figure and i finally got him. if you see this figure pick it up because he is very rare. i recommend this toy to any star wars fan.
2,Far too Shabby!,"I bought Mace because, well, I think he's really cool. Butfrom the aotc toys that I own, he is by far the worst.Mace is positioned in a stiff pose that is cool, but you can'treally have any fun playing with him. His eyes are closed and hismouth is wide open and I find this very hard to play with.(unless it is a death scene or when he gets really mad)He does come with an amazing lightsaber that has a magneticattration to his hand to re-anact force power. I find that hislightsaber falls out of his hand without much presure and thismakes for for some pretty frustrating battles....Overall I would not recommend this toy, unless your obsessedwith the Geonosis Rescue, and love to re-anact it.Far Too Shabby!"
2,Disappointing- No story is ever finished,"I took a risk buying this book. I was intrigued by these secret warriors and was further intrigued reading Wild Bill Donovan's biography. Irvin seems to have done his homework and the set up was well written. My problem was every story was written from a 10,000ft and never seemed to finish. I was lost trying to keep track. Stories would start never having ended another.Scattered thoughts on written page."
5,What a pleasant and surprising read! Well done!,"A pleasant record of a small bit of history often ignored by traditional historians. And, it is written by one of their own - a former special forces officer. The author presents this piece of history by breaking it down and describing the feats off only a few Jedburgh teams (out of hundreds). Additionally, the author adds specific historical aspects and backgrounds to give context to the story. An essential piece for anyone with an interest in special forces/operations. This book, after all, tells the birth of modern special forces. Simply put, a great read."
4,Informative read,This book would be of special interest to readers who enjoy historical accounts of covert operations that occurred during World War 11.
4,How Special Forces Began,"Ever Wondered where the French Resistance in WWII got their name of Machi? Well, this is the book for you. You will also find out how the Jedburghs got their name and how the Allies supplied and supported resistance forces from Belgium and France and, after the fall of Germany, to Asia a well to help defeat the Japanese. The Jeds parachuted behind enemy lines and supplied resistance forces with arms and assistance. What a story! This was the beginning of Special Forces. See how it all began in spite of it being ""ungentlemanly""according to the Allied pre-war General Staffs."
4,Bose-Schmose!,"This is an excellent deal. Does it sound as good as $1,000 systems? It is close! I don't think you can get near this level of performance for anywhere near this price. AV Express provides outstanding customer support (first receiver shipped was defective, but AV Express quickly arranged for me to obtain a replacement without any cost to me).Receiver is a bit dated (no HDMI) and controls are far from intuitive, but it appears to be a decent receiver. The automatic setup with the included microphone didn't yield the best settings for my large living room. I had to manually increase the ""channel selector"" control to raise the level on the satellite speakers (front, center, and rear surrounds to +10 and the subwoofer to +6). Without these adjustments the sound was just too low, and the receiver seemed weak. The 5 speakers are really outstanding, though, and the subwoofer gets the job done."
5,surround sound,This Item is excellent. My son and I just love it. Everything works as it is suppose to. I recommend this product.
1,The receiver is not reliable--receivers DIE,"I have had my SLS Q-Line Gold system for several years. My first receiver lasted maybe 8 months before going haywire. It didn't just up and quit on me. No no. It started doing random things--changing inputs, dimming the display, changing volume--all by itself. It was replaced under warranty. (Quite a smooth replacement I might add.) The 2nd receiver lasted another year before dying (and I'm out of warranty and thus SOL). It will play audio for about 30 seconds from whatever source you've selected. Then there is a little burst of static. Then all sound is gone. If you turn it off and back on (full power down, not just standy), it will play again for maybe thirty seconds. Maybe it is running Windows and needs rebooted often. :)The speakers are pretty good. The sub is ok--a little boomy, and a bit weak on the very low bass."
5,Great System,"This is an outstanding sounding system, once you finally figure how to set it up. The instructions that came with it, are not complete enough, so, unless you are a true techie, you will have problems. Recommend getting a pro to install. I had to install this three times on three different sets in order to figure out how to get it to even turn on. The sound is crisp and beautiful, and you can crank this system to the max with no distortion. It carries well from my living room throughout my bedroom, and you can hear it well on the patio if you really crank it. It is an awesome product, just incredibly difficult to get the system hooked up."
5,Law school just got easier!,"First let me say that StoreLaw's tech support should get a raise (or at least a pat on the back). I cannot believe how responsive and helpful they've been. It's a truly rare thing these days. Next I want to say that I love StoreLaw - the concept is right on target. There's no way I'd go back to using the word processor. Take my advice, stop messing around w/ word processing software & get Storelaw!"
1,"Awful, awful product","Storelaw 2.0 is a huge waste of money, and customer support is non-existant. There are very significant bugs in the program (things erase all the time, you're constantly prompted to backup, borders aren't properly laid out, the word processor is VERY clunky, and spellcheck is awful). Avoid Storelaw! I totally regret buying it."
1,Save Your Dollars and Save Your Grade,"Don't risk your grades using this software. A poorly written application for Microsoft's Ascend, laced with bugs and anomalies. Editing is difficult at best, some keystrokes lock it up (download the trial and try <shift-space>. Tech support is a recording that says see the web site. Email to tech support yields a message ""elevated to level 2"" or ""elevated to sales""; never to be heard from again.Can only install once, when your machine gets a virus or needs a new copy of Windows, you are dealing with that elusive tech support. During the hours to days it takes support to respond, you have to leave the registration window open or it will generate a new code and you get to start the whole process over.When you need your notes for the exam, this trashware is not the basket to put them in..."
2,"high on quantity, low on quality","I purchased this to hear new versions of some old standards. It might be handy to have all of these songs in one set, but the musical quality is awful. Many of the arrangements are awful! Buyer beware..."
5,Motorola Cordlesses Are Great!!!,"I've had an older model for over 8yrs, which I thought went bad. So I bought these new models. Once I got them setup properly, I haven't had a problem since. The directions are a little sketchy setting up the main base & the ans. machine (TAKE NOTE: Two Separate Devices! Each Need To Be Set Up To Keep Proper Date & Time!). All the features work great! Remote ans. machine access is my favorite. Then I replaced the battery on my old Motorola cordless & that's up & running. Great products!!"
3,"Good phone, answering machine won't hold settings","We bought this unit because it's the only system on the market we could find that you can use a wireless camera with (we use it as our baby monitor). The system works very well but the answering machine isn't worth a hoot ! ! The machine constantly loses it's settings for no apparent reason (no loss of power) and resets to any given day/date and time it wants, so if you require an accurate log of messages this unit can not provide that. The phones do have caller ID and the day/date seems to stay current on those (assuming you don't leave them off the charger so the battery is dead) The battery life of the phone is awful, it will be on the charer all night and die on the first phone call you make you may get 5 min you may get 30 min. shared phonebook function is great on this system."
2,WARNING.,"Never owned a phone before that does not warn you before the battery dies. Most often in the middle of a call. Maybe this is a ""feature"" that is turned off...but we can't find any setting for this. Unacceptable. Also, the battery life itself leaves a lot to be desired. We have two handsets and one lasts a lot longer than the other - weird."
3,"nice features, poor battery life","good phone, but uses AAA rechargable batterys rather than AA's other phones use, this use of smaller batterys results in a less that 1 hour talk time, i dont ues phone much, but when i do i would expect a longer talk time"
3,Good But Some Disappointments,"Nicely styled. Fairly easy to use except for two top manu keys which are hard to press without hitting the ones beneath them. This is the third 5.8 I've owned and has slightly less range than either of the other two (AT&T & Panasonic). Caller ID doesn't sync with phone book to identify caller. ""Private"" phonebook being default is a pain if you want phonebook to be shared. Only 10 characters allowed for phonebook entries. Busy screen. Still, overall OK, with lower range being biggest disappointment."
4,Wide range of capabilities,"With the optional bluetooth cell phone dock and regular phone connectivity it is a good phone to have. While there have been some issues with the bluetooth, I feel they are mainly caused by the cell phone and not the docking station. It is a good phone and works great."
2,This game needs treatment itself,"This is a poor game.What matters is that the game is simply so uncomfortable, I don't want to continue playing after an hour... ever.It is so overloaded with micromanagement and ineffectively so. You can't even call say 3 ambulances at once. You have to click the car, load it with crew, send. Then do it all over again for the second unit...Nobody does anything unless told.One can carry a victim, but can't put into ambulance unless checked. So I brought him next to the ambulance, put down, let doctor investigate for a second.. then pick up again, put into the car together with the doctor (as she can't examine in the car)... (mouse click - mouse click - mouse click million times)...It is from bottom up a very poor game, except the videos, how accidents happened. They are well worked out. But videos have nothing to do with gameplay.Yes, I regret I bought it."
4,Interesting Game to play,"I give the game 4 stars, becuase not everyone likes to collect video games that are fire related. IOtherwise, it is a very very good game to play."
1,Never ran.,I'm running Windows 7 32 bit. The program never ran. All it did was crash on start up so I never got the chance to try it.
3,"Great concept, poor execution.","The game is fun. However it could have been more fun.There are some hiccups in the game that make you want to not play very long.The missions are too fast, and constant. When doing challenges, there's always something too dramatic going on that makes it impossible to complete the challenge. Such as a fire explosion, then an accident, then a wreck, then a shooting rampage. All back to back and the navigation sucks. So it makes it near difficult to complete. Plus never enough funds to survive the challenges."
3,Didn't Work,"The game itself may deserve more or less than 3 stars but I'm not going to trash a game because I never got to play it or praise it when I really have no idea. At any rate.....I downloaded this last night onto Windows 7 64-bit and it did not work.Several times I tried to dl, install and run it and it just refused to run. The download and install appeared to go off without a hitch but it kept CTDing immediately after starting it.Oh well, that's the breaks I guess and this is the first time I've ever had a single problem with any of several Amazon downloads."
4,Large Format,"This book is ridiculously large in comparison to normal textbooks for class. For it being a book on sustainability and becoming environmentally aware, it is a large consumer on paper. The material covered in it though, with the graphs and photos do make it more interesting, and it helps break down the information to make it much more relatable to us, first world consumers to the struggles of the less fortunate."
3,Last Wishes - Funeral Planning Lite,I found this book to be a good resource to expose the reader to the many things that need to be considered when planning a funeral. There is so much to know about this topic to make informed decisions that I was a little dissappointed at the lack of depth in covering topics. With many of the topics covered in just a few pages there wasn't enough depth to the explanations. Perhaps it takes more than approx 120 pages to adequately cover this subject.
4,Last Wishes,Found this book to be not only educational but also in a format easily understood. I purchased several copies for my family and friends.
2,A let down,"I am an avid Dale Brown fan. I was excited to read Dreamland Nerve center. I was quite disappointed. I am not sure how much input Mr. Brown had on this project but it would be better if he took his name off of it. It was stale, predicatble and very cheesy. I think the characters are good but the only person who would actually enjoy reading this is a female highschool wall flower. It should be displayed in the cheap romance novel catagory. The next book in the Dreamland series can be nothing but better than this one. I will give Dreamland another chance because I like Mr. Brown. But, that being said, I can only take so much cheap romance."
2,"Dreamland, Nerve Center",Dale Brown is a much better solo writer. In Nerve Center there are too many characters each with too many names. Very confusing at times & the story is broken up into too many short chapters. I'm hoping the next two Dreamland books are better organized & more fun to read. I've read all of Dale Brown's other books. Thanks.
4,It works,"This is the only blemish cream that I use. It works. Give it a shot. You don't have to use a lot of it either. I found that it did leave a residue that is visible on my brown skin, so I would suggest using it at night time. I have used it during the day and I don't think anyone noticed."
4,I would recommend this product. I occasionally get ...,"I would recommend this product. I occasionally get a blemish, and on one, I used the Persa-Gel. In two days the pimple vanished. I really liked the tube that the cream came in. It was so much more convenient than the bottle. Thanks for opening my skin to a great item."
2,It reduce redness but it doesn't get rid of it,It probably not a product for me. You see I have the really big type of ance that grow deeper under the skin and this product does not clear it. It does reduce the redness though.
1,MADE ACNE WORSE & THERE'S A WHITE SPOT ON MY FOREHEAD!!,"I used this product for 2 weeks but only before i went to sleep. Then once i put it on my forehead for the day and by the end of the day i noticed a huge white spot spread across my forehead. I dunno what it is but its not normal for sure . Don't buy this junk, waste of $$. Every time i would put it on acne before i went to bed i would wake up with the painful pimples that made a huge bump on your skin. I stopped using this and my skin cleared up SO WELL. Anyway, i don't recommend this AT ALL ."
5,Best Acne Product IMO,"Suddenly had an adult acne breakout around my t-zone, hadn't had acne since a teen, making it about 10 years or so. Tried salicylic acid products, worked terribly. Then I remembered that the only thing that worked for me as a teen was benzoyl peroxide, purchased this, and it worked wonderfully. Will be repurchasing this again and again as needed."
2,Meh.,"Not fantastic. Didn't really do anything for me. Dried out my skin a little bit but does stain very easily so be veryyyy carrful! And it leaves a light white residue behind but it's not a big deal. A few people here said it left those big sore pimples that you can never really pop. This gave my a few of them so I stopped using it, kind of defeats the whole purpose of an acne cream if it gives you more pimples than you started with."
4,The only stuff I use,"I've struggled with acne for most of my life. It's settling down now that I'm in my 30s, but every now and then I'll get an annoying break out on my chin or nose.I keep this stuff on hand at all times. Other zit creams would dry out my skin too much (I have sensitive skin). This stuff is pretty strong but not harsh on you.One thing to note is that it's benzoyl peroxide so it WILL bleach fabrics and towels. It bleached my pillowcases almost immediately, so if you're applying it at night I'd recommend using pillowcases and sheets that you don't care about.Other than that, I love this product. Sometimes I'll put it on my entire face even if I don't have breakouts, because it keeps my oily skin under control in hotter weather."
3,I have many outbreaks with acne a month. ...,"I have many outbreaks with acne a month. It's not severe, but it does affect my self-conscience. While using this product, I particularly liked that it didn't cause overdrying which many products do. It did help to clear up a blemish that I had. It took a little longer than what I'm used to with the product I normally use, but I would recommend this as a second choice."
5,It works !,I choose this rating because i was all broken out with acne and just started using this product and my acne is finally clearing up.
4,"Its cream, not gel.",It works very well in reducing time pimples are present. helps dry them up. only reason i give 4 is because i was hoping for clear gel. this is white cream.
3,worked good,I do see an improvement when using this product however I can only use this product once in awhile because it dries out my skin and I get this little bumps if I use it more than once every few days. I wouldn't buy again but I would recommend to someone who didn't have sensitive skin like mine.
1,Not good for sensitive skin,"I have bad acne and have for years. Just recently, though, I started getting cystic acne. I tried this product, and at first I thought it was working because my skin seemed to clear up a little after the first night. However, even though I was only using it once a night, it started severely drying out my skin. My skin got very itchy and flaky, and then I started getting acne even WORSE until I had huge patches of itchy acne all over my cheeks and jawline. I would not recommend this for anyone with super sensitive skin like mine."
1,Redness plus itching...,"I put this product on the acne on my back, let it dry and fell asleep for an overnight treatment. When I woke up the next morning, my pillow case was ruined from this product bleaching it!!!!I tried it agin, but this time on my forehead (where I have the most acne). I woke up the next morning with a bright red/ itchy forehead.BY ALL MEANS, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!"
4,Waiting for the effect,"I have tried two days, till now no big difference between this product and other product which I tried before. Hope that it will function better later."
2,Not a fan,"I don't know why I keep buying this, it does not work for me. As far as I can tell, it's M.O. is to dry out the pimple and all surrounding skin until it's so dry it just breaks off like chalk. I don't know, but it's really uncomfortable. For me it is a cycle of putting on cream, about 15 minutes later the spot feels tight and itchy, so I have to wash it off, then I go back and put more on, etc. etc. The Neutrogena stuff is better and in the same price range. Clean & Clear makes some great face wash, but this one is a fail."
3,"Good for Blemish Control, A Bit Pricey","Clean & Clear Persa-Gel 10 is essentially 10% Benzoyl Peroxide cream. When applied to a blemish or affected area, it helps heal the blemish as well as reduce future breakouts. I have extremely sensitive skin yet I have not had any problems using this product- it dries but it does not overdry and there is no red areas after treatment. If you do not rub this product in enough, it will leave a white spot on your face so be sure to properly apply this product. Keep it away from your eyes as it will sting and be sure to wash your hands after you put in/take out contacts or else you'll get an unpleasant surprise. The Clean & Clear product is really no different than some of the off-brand ones they sell at pharmacies so you might want to save a few dollars and get the generic if you can."
3,Dissapointed. Mixed results. Will not buy again.,"I get a lot of those under the skin painful cyst-like pimples, and I have blackheads as well. Sometimes the Persa-Gel helps with shrinkage over a few days, sometimes not at all. I do feel that once the acne has erupted, the persa-gel works faster.I had no idea why my bathroom towels were having bleach spots until I read the reviews here. Wish I had seen them sooner!I will try using the gel on blackheads and post-acne marks as recommended by a reviewer and see if it helps with that, but I have already ordered Buffering Lotion from Mario Badescu in the hopes that it will give better results. We shall see!"
5,"Since having children, my skin hasn't been the ...","Since having children, my skin hasn't been the same. I've experienced oily skin on my chin and forehead and nothing really worked. Either it cost too much, wasn't effective, or hurt my skin. Clean & Clear Persa-Gel 10, Maximum Strength helped my skin a lot. There wasn't as much oiliness and the gel didn't hurt or sting my skin. It's like a cream more than a gel. It went on with no problem and didn't leave a shiny or oily feel to my skin."
4,STRONG but effective,"I have extremely sensitive skin so I was hesitant about purchasing this product after I read the negative reviews. I found that the first night I put on the white gel (kind of looks like cream) my skin was soft and smooth and all pimples that had started forming were gone. I made the mistake of putting it on again in the morning... SO much burning and my face became bright red and puffy so I applied lotion to ease the tingling, burning sensation. By the end of the day, my face was super dry (and still is 2 days later) but I haven't formed any more acne and my face, though dry, is bright and soft. As long as I use this product once a week, I think it will work perfectly! Also, I haven't noticed any bleaching, as many of the reviewers have, but I'm trying to be very careful and not wear dark clothing when I sleep with it on my face."
5,Fills a nice niche,"Those interested in American political history and the founding of our constitutional government will find this book extremely helpful. Borden fills a unique niche in American history and the history of political parties by describing how American political parties developed in the early republic. While most knowledgeable people are aware that the founding fathers abhorred political parties as institutionalized factions that were destructive to democratic principles, Borden gracefully describes how the founding fathers nonetheless became drawn to parties as a means of gaining control. Indeed, without the founding of the Democratic-Republican Party the Alien and Sedition Acts may never have been repealed and our government may look very different. The impact of foreign policy (pro-British Federalists and pro-French Democratic-Republicans) is also discussed at length. A short read and a valuable resource, I recommend this book heartily."
4,Jeff Allen,This is a very funny comedy alblum. This is a great value and is great for the whole family. Even my 12 year old grandchild loves this alblun
3,Cross Bow Targer,Little misleading. It shows a picture of the large target which sales for 38 to 48 dollars. That is alot bigget than the one you get which is 12 x 12 with one target in the middle. I got it to discharge my weapon. I lost 3 bolts last year doing this so I am happy for what it is but they should show the smaller size in the add.
4,Hurricane H12 Bag,"This bag is nothing like shown on the picture, Looks large with many bullseyes on it!! It is small with (1) one bullseye in the middle of it... It does stop bolts very well though."
4,A Godiva Sampler,"I enjoyed this book because I didn't have to commit to an entire novel, and was surprised by the authors I liked:Melissa Senate, Cindy Chupak and (the big surprise) Lauren Weisenberger (as I wasn't a fan of DWP).Weisenberger had an interesting heroine with a lousy boyfriend, and she travels off to the other end of the world to make him squirm--or does he?I was surprised by Weiner's attempt, and it appeared that she may have been reading a lot of Green, Holden and Maxted with her stab at being British. Stick with what you know so we can enjoy your talent."
4,Funny and Tender,I bought this book because I'm an avid fan of Jennifer Weiner. As a result I have been introduced to the fun and whimsical writing of the other authors who contributed their short stories.Each short story is engaging and very entertaining.
3,Just OK,I kind of felt like just when I started getting into a story it ended.. maybe short stories arent for me. If you do like just clips of stories this is a good book
4,Fun read most of the time,"Most of the short stories were quite good and left me wanting to delve into the characters more; others not so much. Overall a good, light read."
5,Delightful Short Stories,"This book, filled with short stories, was simply delightful. It was humorous in parts, sweet in others, and so much fun. It opened my eyes to authors I was not yet familiar with, while I also recognized authors of some of my favorite chic lits. :) Don't miss this one. It is pure fun. I gave it five stars because it is worth reading. It is easy to pick up and put down due to the fact that they are short stories; however, some of the stories were boring while others left me wanting more. I think the beauty of this book is it introduces you to authors that you might not be familar with as of yet."
3,Helpful and handy,This is a good little reference book with everything in alphabetical order. It was handy for those times during my read that I couldn't remember if the character was real or fictional and if there were things that I didn't understand or had forgotten.
5,Book Reviews,"This book is very good in that after reading it, you get a good idea about what the WWII B-25 bomber crews experienced while they were on their missions and what when on while they were back at their base waiting for the next mission."
2,Poor Construction,"This started out as a great project for my 10 year old nephew and my husband. They worked together to do the wiring and were having a great time. However, when they got to the ""easy"" part (putting all of the components in the plastic case) things went downhill. The plastic was so misconstructed that things would not ""snap"" in properly, the knobs would not fit through the holes, etc. The radio is now held together by tape, my nephew is very disappoionted, and my husband is very aggrevated! What a sad ending to our evening."
3,A must read if you enjoy beautiful bikes.,This book has categorically shown off some of the most beautiful bikes made. Unfortunately the description needs to updated. Lance armstrong has never won a tour title. He's been stripped of all of them. Foreword by a liar.Just saying.
3,"Pictures, History, Information...","Well, a dining-alcove book anyhow. History, racing. I liked the technical tidbits on how the bicycle became perfected. Why those tippy early models with the huge front wheel you perched atop? Because no chain drive yet, no ball bearings (the atoms of the machine age, replacing fraying bushings), and before the pneumatic tire the larger the wheel the softer the ride. Oh, and angled spokes helped too. The pedal replaced the back-and-forth treadle, which increased speed many-fold. Who knew? And suspension springs aren't just for comfort, they enormously aid off-roading. Now I know. The other reviews here tell more. Praise the bicycle, which in my opinion ranks with microwave ovens, duct tape, and word-processors as the noblest inventions..."
2,Chi sono gli intepreti?This is recorded Traviata with Scotto and Kraus,"This is recorded Traviata with Scotto and Kraus, two of the singers I have heard most often in theatre. I have not seen the complete cast list, however it is rumoured that the role of Flora's servant, who invites parfty goers into dinner with the words 'la cena e pronta' is sung by the tenor Giuseppe di Stefano. Is this true?"
3,Too much of the book is just the basics of Java and APIs,"I was disappointed by this book because significantly more than half of its pages are spent giving an overview of the basics of Java and some of the key APIs. Only 8 of the 25 chapters (164 of its 466 pages) actually deal with implementations of scientific, engineering and mathematical formulas and algorithms.This book is designed for people who need to learn Java from scratch while seeing how it can be used in a very limited number of technical applications.If are you already a reasonably proficient Java programmer and are considering this book just as a source for implementations of scientific, engineering and mathematical formulas and algorithms, you will not be getting your money's worth."
4,Logic Dispels Fear,"One of the more rational examinations of current events, this book doesn't fall into the emotionalism or sensationalism which prevailed during the Y2K scare of only a couple of years ago. Instead, West correlates world events to show connections, problems, and - solutions.You'll disagree with some of his viewpoints, as I do. But you'll be challenged to examine the facts, and you'll turn a new eye towards the news of the day.Meantime, I can't help but realize that the true Y2K problem won't surface until about 2035...and will be considerably more dangerous than the small alarm of 2000.*jeep! ---Chet"
3,white residue on face,"Originally I was worried about allergy. I have to say this treatment may be too mild to me. It works, not significantly.Also I found this is NOT transparent gel, but some white cream which does not fully absorbs, and leads to an ugly face white white spots."
2,Too harsh despite claims of being more gentle,"Everyone has different skin, but mine tends to dry out and get easily irritated. I thought Neutrogena On-the-Spot would be a good solution because of the lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide. Unfortunately the product made my skin red and flaky, so much so that it is taking a few days for my skin to get back to normal. I usually have pretty good luck with Neutrogena products, but I think I'll be getting my skin care items elsewhere."
3,"With a new baby in the house, my ...","With a new baby in the house, my skin is going through all the hormonal differences as it gets back to normal. I've also had a few spots of adult acne to contend with. I tried the Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment and while it DID NOT dry out my skin, it didn't seem to do much for the spot of acne. Again, my skin is going through some weird things and this just may be what it does for me and not for someone else."
1,Buy Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum Instead,"Between this Neutrogena Spot Treatment and Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum, there is no contest! The Oxy works and the Neutrogena does not, pure and simple. I have only the occasional pimple these days, but want a treatment that quickly dries up the oil and inflammation. The Oxy costs more but is worth the price, the Neutrogena does nothing (as far as I can tell) as a spot treatment. A better medicine will prevent scarring and disfiguring marks on your face! Early application of effective medicine can stop an emerging blemish before it becomes much worse. The Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum did a far better job for me."
4,The best over-the-counter cream,"This product is relatively good in the sense that it prevents breakouts. I usually put it on troubled areas every other night, and I've had few breakouts since I started to use this. Even though there are several creams that are more effective prescribed by the doctor (Aberela is extremely effective and my favorite for sure), this Neutrogena cream is the most effective I've had without having a prescription. It does make your skin dry"
2,It didn't work on me....,It didn't dry out my skin or anything but it didn't get rid of any pimples I had...I guess it depends on the skin types..
1,Be aware if you're allergic to benzoyl peroxide!,"I've been using some daily face cleaning products that fights acne that contains salicylic acid, and it seems like my skin is fine with those. Then I was going to try this on-the-spot treatment, because I wanted to see if it could help me get rid off a few particularly big acne. And it turns out I am allergic to it, and using this was a BIG mistake that I made. On the first day, I seemed okay, but then my skin started looking red on the areas that I applied this on the second day. Then the third day, my skin has progressed to very itchy burning rash. I think this product may be great for people who are not allergic to benzoyl peroxide, but for people who may be allergic to it, please TEST it first before you start really using it! I am giving it one star just for my experience and raised red flag for people with sensitive skin like mine. Hope you guys be cautious before using this."
1,Not intended for..,"I wouldn't recommend it for people who are allergic to benzyl peroxide, I didn't know I was allergic till I tried this. HUGE MISTAKE!!! Woke up the next morning with swollen eyes and really bad irritation my face was completely itchy and red. I really think that over all it does make the acne go away but if your sensitive do not use."
1,Works great but causes discoloration in clothes and pillows,The product works as advertised but with a MAJOR drawback. The benzoil peroxide produces discoloration in clothes and pillows by bleaching.
4,Some improvement over time,"I purchased this product after in was recommend as a disinfectant in the book Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me. I had been becoming extremely frustrated with my oily skin and frequent breakouts, so I was ready to try something new. For the past 1 1/2 months, I have been religiously using this product in the morning and Clear Pore Nighttime Clarifying Gel (a BHA product) prior to bed. While I haven't seen miraculous results, I have had a reduction in breakouts, and my skin texture seems to be slowly improving. In addition, I am no longer getting the dry, flaky patches which I was getting with other products. However, my skin is still oily, and I do still experience the occasional breakout. While this product certainly might provide you with some benefits over time, keep in mind that you will not see immediate results: despite the claims, there is NO product available which can get rid of existing blemishes."
2,Not showing any effectiveness,"Ive used this from time to time over the past month or so to essentially no avail. The product did not diminish any bump I put it on.My acne is by no means severe so a simple astringent such as witch hazel with a neutrogena facial cleansing bar is all I use to minimize breakouts. The cream I would use to apply at night on the one or two bumps that occasionally appeared. However, all that would come of my effort was dried-up cream when I awoke in the morning where I had applied over the bump. Not sure if it takes a few days for the bump to disappear or if I should have been applying every night until it reduced, but I did not. I used the product once per pimple. Again, to virtually no difference."
4,It works!,"I used to have pretty bad acne, but thankfully it cleared up! I do sometimes get the occasional pimple..yippee. Lucky me, I got a big one right in the middle of my cheek right before vacation. I bought this on a whim and thought I'd try it on my bad timing zit. I washed my face like normal twice a day and covered the pimple with this. After a day, it was gone! It wasn't red and puffy anymore, and with a little make-up was nonexistant!I don't think you should slather this all over you face though, it does really dry out your skin and leaves it feeling kind of stiff and like you have dry soap on it... but overall, I think it's great!"
5,It's fantastic,"When I was a teenager many many many years a go, I discovered this product after trying this product, and it hasn't failed me since. I highly recommend it."
2,Rashes??!!,"So, I am only giving this product 2 stars. Here is my story:I walked into my local grocery store looking for some kind of acne treatment that would work perfectly. I came across this cream, which worked instantly and right away! Only problem was, a week after using this product, I began breaking out in a rather itchy rash and had to use hydrocortisone to get rid of it. I purchased this product in hopes of it working, which it did, but it caused a bigger problem and I had to walk around with a red, itchy face until it went away. I was pleased with this product until it decided to fail me. I would recommend this product for everyone wanting to zap their acne instantly, but if you have an allergic reaction to other acne CREAMS, I would suggest staying away from this product."
3,Doesn't work well for me,I usually would use Clearasil's blemish cream but decided to try this instead as it had really good reviews. I don't think it works as well on my skin as Clearasil's blemish cream did and I would probably not purchase it again.
2,not working,"I had to use a lot of this to get results. Arbonne's cream works better and faster, it's just expensive. Thought I'd save money with this, but Arbonne is better."
1,Save your money,"I bought this ""primer"" book because I thought it can help me to understand the Sybase Replication Server better. But this book is difficult to read and understand. You can learn much more from the Sybase manuals that come with the Replication Server. Sadly, this is the only Sybase Replication Server book which is available commercially. But it will get you no where. Save your money."
2,A reasonably good book but is not a primer,"I got this book before I attended the Sybase Replication Server course and I found it hard to understand the concepts and explanations in the book. I re-read this book after I have attended the Sybase course and found that it is easier to understand. It's a good book to have if you are still using Replication Server 11.0. Things are slightly different in versions 11.5 and above. If you want another book to suppliment the Sybase manuals, this is a reasonably good book (not that you have many choices)."
1,I regret buying this book,I wanted a book on sybase replication server and bought this book since this was the only one available.I found the Sybase supplied manuals to be easier than this book. teh course which sybase offers is also good.I regret buying this book
1,A complete waste of time,"After reading reviews on here, I decided to give this book a shot. I just finished reading it and I am surprised that I was able to even get through it. The book is very flat and repetitive, the same thing happening over and over and over. It was also quite predictible, which makes the book even that much more boring. I have read other books by VC Andres and was impressed, but this was just a complete disappointment and waste of time."
5,One of the best V. C. Andrews yet!,"I just finished reading Celeste and I felt so bad for her. First, her brother dies in an accident, and her mom sortof blames her for it. Then, they bury Noble, but for some reason, she's calling Celeste Noble and the Noble being buried is wearing her clothes! After all of the pressure, she faints. Later, she wakes up to find herself in Nobles bed, with her hair cut, and she's wearing his clothes. What will happen next? Read it to find out."
2,Ghostwriter needs to give up the ghost,"It surprises me that so many people don't seem to know that VC Andrews passed away almost 20 years ago- that's why ""her work"" seems repetitive. The ghostwriter just continues to rework her themes in an attempt to stay ""true"" to her early works. Just a ploy for others to cash in on her name if you ask me. But I was desperate for a ""beach read"" and so picked this up.Celeste is a bit tired and slow, in my opinion. VC Andrews real work was gothic, which can often mean a bit overwrought as well as dark, and this was part of their charm. This is dark (maybe), but lacks the artistry, well drawn characters, and story development.I was a huge fan of the Dollanganger series and My Sweet Audrina. I've tried some of the ghost work, none seem interesting or compelling. Save your money, just reread the REAL VC Andrews!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!,"I've read all of this author's books and this one was just plain bad, dumb, and stupid. I tried to read the next in the series but knew it wasn't going to get any better. I generally enjoy these stories but this one was very tiresome and idiotic.Save your money for something better."
1,Lackluster debut to a terrible series,"This series made no sense to me. The premise of twins with 'gifts' was a interesting one, but not appropriate for the VCA genre.This book/series bothered me in so many ways. NO reason is given for Mom's obsessive preference over Noble. She doesn't explain or give any indication as to why Noble is her valued child, even though his 'gifts' are apparently lacking. The preference for Noble is so obvious, and when Celeste is forced to assume his role, that really goes too far. After Celeste had to assume his role, the story only spun into more silliness and implausibility. I just wanted to shake everyone in this story. Why didn't Celeste run away and get help? Why didn't she stand up to her rapist? Why didn't she insist that she was Celeste?This book was just filled with holes and poor writing, and I am ashamed that this was published under Miss Andrew's name. Neiderman should just publish these under his own name!"
3,Very twisted story...,"I don't want to say i disliked this book..I didn't love it like the ""Flowers"" series...but it did reflect back to it in a way. Sarah has some big issues when she decides to turn Celeste into her brother Noble...and then keeps Celeste from being a mother to her own child. I can't wait to read Black Cat."
3,Not one of her better efforts...,"What do you get when you combine the best elements of the Dollanganger series, the Cutler series, and ""My Sweet Audrina""? Amazingly, a very difficult read. While it is a switch from the ""poor girl doesn't know she's rich"" theme, it's very odd, and many of the ideas (other than Mommy trying to make her daughter over into a boy to replace her lost son) are not at all original. (In fact, one character describes a TV film that he watched some time before, and it sounds eerily like the plot of ""Dawn"".)My advice? Get hold of Andrews' earlier work. This is only for her most dedicated fans."
2,All Too Familiar,"Honestly, I very much enjoyed the book. I found the character Celeste ""Nobel"" very interesting and found the homosexual under tones appealing as well. The thing that bothers me though is that it's all most too much like Flowers in the Attic.Even the writing style it self.I have to wonder though if stuff like this really happens any more. It's imaginative but all most too imaginative, and too much like Flowers in the Attic.Yes I do like the book and I will be awaiting for the sequel. Still it's all too serial."
5,Like a REAL VC book...the very best the GW has done.,"CELESTE has elements of both Flowers in the Attic and My Sweet Audrina, rather than being just another Heaven rip-off. Celeste's character is intriguing because she honestly believes everything her mother tells her, as opposed to a Dawn-like heroine who KNOWS everyone around her is wacky. Celeste doesn't even realize how traumatized she is. For once, I didn't feel it was the same old character speaking.Sarah is absolutely nuts, and it's not just ""I want to stay young and beautiful forever."" It's refreshing to see characters who are not what we'd expect...for instance, I expected the ""boy next door"" to be a sympathetic character. He's not.Finally, a reader can easily see why the next two books are NECESSARY, not just filler. All in all, a very satisfying VC experience, which hasn't happened in a long time. (Of course the GW's aggravating writing style such as ""Her eyes grew small"" is still apparent, but try to ignore it and enjoy the plot.)"
5,"Accessible, Informative,Timely and Worth Reading","I enjoyed reading this book because it is both accessible and sophisticated. In a discourse too often characterized by polemics and sound-bites, Minow offers a thoughtful view of the trend toward privatization. Reading her book helped me see how complex these issues are, and gave me new insight into arguments I might otherwise have dismissed. I found it a rare treat."
5,sweet!,"THIS CHARCHTER IS FUN TO PLAY WITH.I LIKE HIS CANNON.HE LOOKS COOL BY HIMSELF.I WISH IS GUN WOULD FIT AND STAY IN HIS HAND BETTER.OTHERS SO FAR(SEE THESE REVIEWS)1 JANGO FETT FINAL BATTLE2""RED""CLONE3 BATTLE DROID EXCHANGED FOR SUPER BATTLE DROID"
4,This Gadget Rocks!!,"I have looked at IPOD and other mp3 players in the market and did plenty of research. I found this one to be the best, awesome battery life and good looking design. A lot of the reviews on this gear shows problems with the software but with a little bit of a learning curve is not really that difficult. I took the advice of one the reviewers here and downoaded the MP3 media manager and this gadget works great. IPOD is so overprice IMO."
2,Great! until it broke,"i bought the 1 GB player in December of last year. I had originally wanted the IPOD, but then i decided to get the walkman, or as i call it ""the player"" because i dont know exactly what it is called. It was great! I loved it! I listened to it at least 4 times a day, everyday. Then, i pulled out my headphones, and the little cap by the thing that you turn to change the song broke off! I fixed it, but i had to constantly make sure that i pulled out the headphones gently. It kept on breaking and i lost pieces of the the turner thing. I had to use a rubberband to hold it together. Then, yesterday, i went to listen to it, and it sounds like the singer is under water! I can't hear the main singer, all i hear is the backup singers! i have to tie two rubberbands and press my finger on it to make it work! I'm very upset because i really liked this device, and sadly I am going to buy the IPOD nano.Still, if you arent planning on using this as much as i did, its still a great buy!"
2,Great sound....NOT for sports,"I've had this player for about 2 months now and use it primarily while bike riding, working out and mowing the lawn. While the player sounds great, the cheap clip and earphones make it not worth the money if you are going to use it for anything other than sitting. The clip just pops off where you attach it (and it does not take much) and the ear pieces just fall out (replaced those)."
1,Doesn't work with Macs,"I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. I'm a huge supporter of Sony products, and this MP3 player seemed the best deal for him to use at the gym. Thought I would try to load some songs on it for a surprise, only I got the surprise. The software which they force you to use does not even install on a Mac. I even scoured the Sony website for alternatives on software or other ways to get the songs on the hardware to no avail. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED that I didn't realize this before 4 days til Christmas..."
4,"Small, long lasting and sleek device","Compared to IPOD this Digital player has the foll adv-Small in size-Better battery life (Infact the USB drives have way too much better than IPOD's)-Sharp Design-Good cound quality , as good as an IPODRecommendation: You can plan on getting better ear phones, not that the device comes with bad ones, however if you were into bass and other effects the new ones that drill into the ear are a better option"
1,Requires you to install software from *Sony*,"And just what sort of intrusive DRM comes with that software THIS time?To quote Homland Security to Sony Executives ""It's not your computer."""
1,THIS TOY IS A PIECE ...,"Unless you are a collector, pass this one up. While it is a good likeness, as far as posability, the figure can move its arms only, and if you raise an arm, the way the cloak is designed, it sticks straight out, as if to defy gravity, and looks rediculous. A great collector piece, but no fun if it's for a child to play with. Stick with Chewbacca or r2d2 for kids...theyre much more fun."
4,Naval Novel Niceness,Not the highest artistic writing but a compelling read anyway. I think it is Lonnie Coleman's best book. A naval WWII survivor should understand and enjoy this book.
2,Probably not a good choice for bigger dogs,This toy was chewed apart in the first 24 hours by my 4 month old boxer mix. He liked it a lot but probably not the best choice for a bigger dog.
5,THE BEST!!!,"I previewed this album at a record store--my knees got week when I heard ""You Make My World""! This is still my favorite song. Joseph Vincelli plays with amazing feeling and his music deserves more airtime than it gets."
2,Christmas Present,Well I am sure the story line was great for my grandson BUT the gently used wasnot so true! Live and learn!
4,Skateboarding Tough,"Skate Boarding Tough is about a kid named Brett. He loves to skate board, but when he digs up a skate board he suddenly is able to do awesome tricks. Everyone thinks the skateboard is haunted but Brett knows what is really going on.I like this book because it's a funny book and a mystery combined. The first page grabs you and makes you want to read more.I recommend this book to people who like sports and funny books. So find a library and check it out. You're guaranteed to love it.Kelly, Age 9 1/2 (and dad)"
3,Skate Board Tough,Skate board tough is a good book for people who like skating. The plot is that the kid likes to skate but has a bad board and he finds one in the ground. The board is like magic and makes him skate good. The setting is at his home most of the time and on the side walk and athe end at the skate park. The conflict of this story is that the board he found used to belong to a dead person. another conflict is that he has nowhere to skate. The resolution is that his friend's dad builds a skate park and that he becomes a really good skater just like the dead boy that used to own the board.
4,Skateboard Tough,"Skateboard Tough is a book about a boy who had just moved to a new place. He made new friends and lived his life normal, until one day he discovers something buried in his back yard that changes his life forever. The events that happen next, I will not reveal. You have to get the book and read it yourself.It is a really awesome book. When I first saw the book and picked it up, I was really anxious about reading it. I had a fun time reading the book. Anyone who reads this book will be amazed at how good it is.I would definately recommend this book to anyone who is a skateboarder or even not a skateboarder. Anyone who likes nice, calm, soothing books, this is definately not the one. It is jam packed with surprises. Therefore, I would definately recommend this book to anyone and everyone who enjoys reading."
3,A good but not great biography,"In this biography of Jay Gould, the reader is acquainted with many of the waypoints, coups, triumphs, and also tragedies in Jay Gould's life. If one is looking for a good resource with which to write a paper about Jay Gould, this book is well worth reading. But on a deeper level, I was quite disappointed that this book didn't quite bring Jay Gould to life, and explain the significance and ramifications of his exploits; change the names and transactions out, and it could just as well chronicle the life of the inventor of frozen cat food. My suspicion is that Renehan doesn't have the technical, historical, or business background to fully understand Gould's achievements, and hence obviously can't share the insights he doesn't have with us.For those looking for a *great* biography with present day relevance, I can only urge other books."
2,Common Problem with History Books,"This is an interesting history. But it has the same problem common to all books such as this. Once a name (person) is introduced in the book the reader is expected to remember the name and the relationship of that person to the ""hero."" There needs to be a chart or reference to which the reader could easily refer to refresh one's memory when finding the name again, but many pages away from the first encounter."
5,"This is a very gentle, non-drying soap. It ...","This is a very gentle, non-drying soap. It has no perfumes or dyes. If you like to wear scents and are looking for a non-scented soap, this would be great. I highly recommend it."
3,I found this soap adequate in its quality. ...,"I found this soap adequate in its quality. I did find that the skin on my face was a little dryer. It seemed to leave a film on my body, as well as on my shower. This may be contributed to our water. We usually use Dove for sensitive skin and I would have to remain with that product."
4,BACK TO BASIS,"Admittedly I'm a pushover for new poducts. When a product is introduced with ruffles, flourishes, and many promises I have to try it if it's within my budget.So, I've wandered far from the Basis fold, trying liquid cleansers, creams and other bar soaps. However, there wasn't a one that cleansed as thoroughly as Basis (two came close but they were very pricey).Basis is a bargain not only in price but in effectiveness. Granted, it's not the most glamorous bar soap on the market but it does the job. One caution: most will probably also have to use an eye makeup remover."
4,I thought I would give the Basis Sensitive ...,I thought I would give the Basis Sensitive Skin Bar soap a try. I have very sensitive skin and find that there are very few products gentle enough for my skin. I really liked the soap and I found it to be very gentle. It didn't make my skin burn when I used it -- it practically soothed it. The only problem was that it still turned the skin on my face red for at least 45 minutes after I used it. So if you have VERY sensitive skin and you're looking for a gentle soap to use before bed this would be a good choice.
5,Excellent book with deep insight,"This is a very good book to help one understand how sexual abuse affects the brain of those who undergo it. This book looks at case histories of those who were horrifically abused from a young age through the teen years and discusses both the shortcomings of standard psychological models and the need for a new paradigm, elements of which are discussed in this book. It could provide more details on how to treat, but understanding must come first, in my opinion. It helps you understand if you have to deal with a child/young adult who suffered through severe or even not overly severe sexual and physical abuse. This would be useful for adoptive parents who adopt children who were so abused to provide insight into how these children perceive the world and the apparently illogical reactions that are sometimes provoked by what would normally be considered positive interations."
3,"Lame, flat ending","A good ending could have saved this book. But no, Abby let Cash off the hook in seconds, after months (hours of torture for me) of pushing her away. Maybe Abby felt good about, but I didn't! Abby was pathetic with no pride. Her mother was about as annoying as they come. And Cash only revealed himself in the last couple of paragraphs. Actually, I'm surprised I even gave it three stars, but I usually leave an under three star rating to books that are too aweful to finish. If you think this book is good, you are missing a whole world of wonderful romances from wonderful authors. Here are a few: Linda Howard, Christine Feehan, Lori Foster, Lucy Monroe, and Karen Robards."
3,OK Read,"This was the very first of the now 32 and counting Bravo books, newly released for digital. (Although it seems pretty obvious that Rimmer initially intended this as only a trilogy about three cousins).I enjoyed most of the book. I liked the heroine. Everybody kept saying how great the hero was, but I didn't really see that for myself. I thought her mother was an horror, which is funny because she was an OK character in several later books. And I totally bought the history behind these people that all grew up together, because almost everything reminded them of earlier parts of their lives.But the last quarter of the book left me ticked off. I thought the hero was a complete a** and I didn't care for the heroine's response to that, and the HEA didn't balance it out for me.Rimmer doesn't disappoint often, and she remains an auto-buy for me. There are only two of the earlier Bravo books still to be re-relased in eformat, and I can't wait!"
3,This soap is supposed to be for dry ...,"This soap is supposed to be for dry skin, and while it felt very creamy when I applied it to my hands, my hands still became cracked with the dry winter air. I think I'll stick to Dove in the future, but the Cetaphil did have a nice scent --very clean and almost floral. However, it was a very soft soap, and after about 5 days it's half the size it was when I received it."
4,I liked this antibacterial soap a lot. I ...,"I liked this antibacterial soap a lot. I especially like that it was in a bar form and not the liquid type that seem so common nowadays. The soap didn't leave an overpowering scent on my skin like many other soaps do. Some antibacterial soaps also leave my skin feeling dry and itchy, but this one didn't make me feel uncomfortable at all. The soap was contoured and easy to hold. I would recommend it to family and friends who are looking for a bar soap that is antibacterial."
3,"""non-soap"" formula?","The description says they use a non-soap forumlation, but look at the list of ingredients: one of the first ingredients is sodium tallowate -- which is basically a fancy name for soap!"
3,Did not help my condition...,"If you're using this soap to counter an allergic reaction that persists even after the allergen is removed, this is probably not going to improve your situation. Eventually, I triedCaress Beauty Bar Soap, Daily Silk, 4.0oz Bars in 8-Count Package (Pack of 3). Not only does Caress cost considerably less but it also moisturizes, and did the trick for me, my rash was gone for good in 3 days. Some time passed and I got a paper-cut, so I appliedDERMOPLAST ANTIBACTERIAL SPRAY 2.75OZ MEDTECH [Health and Beauty] onto it, and the rash was surely back. That was the way I found out what caused my allergic reaction previously. At the time of the rash, I was using Dermoplast often for cuts, rashes (yes I had hoped that it would help my rashes) turned out I was making matters worse without knowing. The strange thing about it is that the rash was persistent and didn't go away until I used Caress soap.Plus honestly, who likes the Cetaphil smell?"
3,Hmmm,Not sure this this product is helping or not i have been using for over a week. It does make my skin feel very smooth and clean after use so i have hope that it will!
3,"This product is intended for dry, sensitive skin, ...","This product is intended for dry, sensitive skin, which I have. It is a moisturizing deodorant soap bar. I didn't like the strong deodorant scent. I prefer a softer one. It also didn't seem to moisturize very well. It does have a good lather, though and rinses without leaving behind a filmy residue."
4,kinda cool by Lucy's brother,"I really like this over most other figures.His helmet comes off and so does his backpack. His face is very detailed even though it's not modeled after a particular person. The gun is cool and stays in his hand, but sometimes it bends too much. I haven't seen him too often, so if you're collecting get him but, there are better Star Wars figures.He does stand up well though."
2,Not What I Expected,"I already believe in the tenants behind ""going local"". I was looking for detailed case studies on how to get it started in my community. This book is more superficial; trying to convince you that going local is a good thing. The case studies are few and barely more than mentioned. The book contains a disappointing number of ""things the government should do"" to force or subsidize going local - which seems anathema to me. Part of going local should be _not_ depending on the government."
2,"Learn some economics, People!","Economies of scale, comparative advantage, specialization? Shuman ignores all these things. There are gains from specialization and trade that most people can't conceptualize, so they resort to fuzzy feeling concepts like sustainable communities. Going Local is going backwards."
5,VERY BEST SONY DV HANDYCAM EVER PRODUCED,"I purchsaed my Sony DCRTRV30 Handycam a little over a year ago. And, I could'nt have purchased a better cam. Most of my cameras (4) are now Sony products and have not found fault with any of them... This camera is impressive in it's size, features, convenience, overall performance, and it's sleek/cool styling. It make's me proud to carry and display it everywhere I go. I'm sorry to see that Sony has discontinued it's production so quickly... Happy shooting."
3,Good product,"Any one who is in the telecomm world knows Ideal makes a good product and this one falls into that catagory, my only complaint is the light gage cords and the lack of a carying case. If you use this toner every day you will need to make a new aligater clip attachment eventualy, the good part is that there are no propriatary parts and you can easily make the clips in the field."
3,If you are picky,"decent tool for the price, wish I had steped up to a different unit due to the atmospher in which I work.I would recomend for light duty work as compared to noisy factory floor or bundles of cable numbering greater than 20, through walls has also been an issue for me."
3,Not my Pace,"My husband and I had taken private dance instruction and were looking to learn some new figures, so we are not complete beginners. The dancer's form on the DVD is very good, and the steps taught are useful. However, I felt that the instruction was too fast paced. You continually have to stop the DVD to learn the steps, rather than having the instruction repeated a number of times. I ordered an intermediate swing dance DVD from a different series and found the instructional pace much better."
5,Ballroom Dancing,"Great instructions, easy to follow. My husband and I practice at home in addition to going to the studio. We finally found a passion that we both can share. It took years for my hubby to entertain the idea until now, and he likes it! Great discovery."
1,Too hard to watch!,Couldn't watch more than 2 mins of this. It's so dated. The studio decor and dress were just too off-putting. Will have to keep looking for that 'perfect' ballroom dancing dvd to help us move to the next level beyond beginner.
5,Prolong your red!,"For anyone who has red highlights or any type of red coloring in their hair, it's a well known fact that it FADES FAST! My dark red highlights fade in a matter of only a few short weeks. A few months ago I began using this product, and I have been thrilled with the results. The red still fades, there is nothing that can completely prevent that, but it lasts much, much longer when using Radiant Red products. My hairdresser was amazed when I went back to get my roots touched up and she asked what on earth I had been using to keep my red from fading. If you want to prolong your red, this is the way to go! And absolutely use together with Radiant Red conditioner!"
5,Shampoo for Red Hair,This is a great product. I have used it in the past and have been unable to find it in any stores around the area. The shampoo lathers up really well and it does wonders for and red hair or red dyed hair. Definitely recommend. Plus the price is great. What more can you ask for.
3,Review,"This product has sulfates in it which strips your hair of color, and it smells like hairspray, which my husband did not like, but it does make hair more manageable and soft."
4,great so far,It's probably one of those products where it is different for all hair types. I went from being a blonde to being a redhead. Everyone told me how fast red hair color fades so after I got it dyed I purchased this right away. My hair holds dye pretty well especially for having barely any pigment in it from being so blonde. I was nervous that even with using this shampoo my red hair would wash out quickly....but so far so good. My hair is still that pretty shade of red it was when I got it dyed. The ONLY thing I wish was different is the fact that this is not a sulfate free shampoo. It tends to dry my hair out after use.Oh and it smells pretty good too :)
4,Great for natural redheads!!!,"Works great for bringing out highlights and also leaves your hair soft and shiny. Even though it is costly, I guess Im willing to pay the couple bucks more for my natural red hair. :D"
1,Not a fan...,"I bought the entire line of red enhancing John Freida products including shampoo, conditioner and glaze. After using these products for 2 weeks, my highlights still weren't evenly tinted plus my hair was probably in the worst condition it has ever been in! I switched back to Kerastase products and included Ted Gibson conditioner in captivating copper, which I use by adding a small amount to my Kerastase condtioner. Wow, no comparison! My hair is looking great again and the TG keeps the highlights beautifully tinted even though I only add it to my conditioner twice per week! I had initially skipped over the TG and went for the JF because of reviews and price but in the end I wasted my money on the JF products which are some of the worst I have ever used! The TG colored conditioner is by far less costly since it works so well and I use a very small amount only twice per week. The bottle will probably last me at least 6 months to a year."
3,Equivalent products are cheaper,"This stuff smells nice and looks okay, but as someone who has dyed my hair red for nearly 20 years, I think the coloresses sulfate free stuff you can buy at Sally or Loreal's sulfate free line work just as well at maintaining color and cost the same or less."
2,Not as described,"The title of this item says ""2-pack"". I was expecting two bottles of shampoo. Only got one. This item is not accurately described."
2,Disappointed,I have used JF products and sadly this left my hair greasy and limp but bought the darker shade and loved it.Maybe this was a different mix.I have tried rinsing more and also using less product but no success. Sorry.
3,not so sudsy,"I have natural auburn hair color, so I decided to purchase this item. Although I can tell my hair shimmers with more redness, the shampoo does not seem to cleanse my hair thoroughly. It leaves my hair feeling a little greasy. I have no problems with my hair getting clean whenever I use other brands. I am going to try a different brand of red enhancing shapoo to see if it will work better with my hair."
1,Horrible stuff,"I bought this shampoo after my red started fading faster than usual; I wanted to rescue what color was left so I purchased this in the hope that i could salvage my color.Unfortunately, this shampoo left a sticky, nasty buildup that left my hair feeling completely damaged. It went completely limp, felt oily and literally sticky and dried out like I'd over bleached/processed my hair or something. I couldn't even run my fingers through my hair without it snagging on massive mats and knots in my usually stick straight and slippery hair:(After about a week of this mess I decided to give up on what was left of my color and use a baking soda and vinegar solution to strip the residue (whatever it was!) out of my hair. It took three days to work this stuff out of my hair and it's finally back to normal. Thankfully what was left of the color wasn't harmed after 'stripping' my hair with the BS/vinegar solution. That's the last time I ever use this shampoo!"
5,Good shampoo product for red colored hair,It helps keeping the red tones on your hair so you don't have to go as often to the salon.
4,Very good,This DVD was very good. It gave you an inside look to the Bee Gees earliest beginnings up until the time the DVD was made. This DVD is a must for any Bee Gees fan. The DVD came on time and I would buy from the seller again.
4,Great Video!,"If you're a fan of the bee Gees this is a great story, lots of fun to watch. Highly recommended!"
4,the 1970's disco era,love these bright guys. i've enjoyed this program. i wish there were more. i'm sure there will be future releases with more bonuses. enjoy.****
4,Not as good as B/W episodes BUT......,it's still the best show on TV! Bought the last 2 seasons to complete the series. I love being able to have my own Andy Griffith Marathon!
3,okay,love seasons one - five. this is the season when barney's gone and the whole changes. did not enjoy the rest of it. but could watch the first few over and over and over.
4,Big Andy Fans,"We have this entire collection so far. This 6th season does not have Don Knotts in all of them, but he does visit. We prefer the black and whites and this is the first in color season. But your still in Mayberry and all is well."
2,"Oh, how the mighty fell","No use piling on Warren. He was fired after a handful of episodes, and they didn't even TRY to replace the deputy role. Obviously, Barney was irreplaceable.However, the producers made an honest mistake in permitting Don Knotts to return. In a ratings/business sense, it was good.But, in the Mayberry-as-fantasy/utopia, it was a disaster.Barney returns to attend a high-school reunion, and we can see he is overjoyed when he learns that the girl he presumably jilted, Thelma Lou (whose last name we never know), is going to show up, too.However, the writers betray the character when they have ol' Thel' married to the foreman of a wrecking crew. Andy can't save Barney from crushing heartbreak. This destroys the illusion of Mayberry, and damages Andy's role as The Man Who Always Makes Things Right.This isn't comedy; it's painful to watch.The same kind of people made Jim Phelps a traitor in a Tom Mapother ego-fest.No thanks."
1,The End,"As some other reviewers have already mentioned this is a DRASTIC change from seasons 1-5. It is a completely different show and not something I ever would have watched if I knew it was like this. I'd like to re-iterate what another reviewer said: ""The previous seasons always made me feel good to watch them, but in season six, Andy is short tempered, snide, argumentative and not the caring sherrif he used to be."" The only episodes where Andy was not completely out of character from all the previous seasons and looked happy was the two that had Barney in them. Andy was good friends with Don Knotts and it seems not having him on the show really affected it. Save yourself the good memories of the Andy Griffith show and stop at season 5."
2,What Happened?,"Let us be as kind as possible to this season, without being moronic. We all agree that black-and-white was better for AGS. But, ALL television was shifting to color in the mid-1960s and there was no way Griffith, Leonard & Co. could buck that tide. And yes, the color of mid-60s TV is especially ugly. Not sure why, but that's the way it is. And, Don Knotts -- bless his soul -- wanted to move on to do ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"", ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"", ""The Reluctant Astronaut"" and other masterpieces. What was Andy Griffith supposed to do -- kidnap the guy?BUT. There is no dang reason in God's good universe for why the tone of the show changed so drastically with Year 6. None! Why did Andy and Aunt Bee become so much more harsh? Why is Andy Taylor always annoyed and angry? Why does he make such rash and silly decisions? What happened to the calm, gentle, wise, Zen-like Sheriff Taylor? WHAT HAPPENED HERE?Can someone please tell me?????"
2,Seasons 6 (and 7 & 8) just aren't funny,"For a good part of my life I've used the epithet ""that's about as funny as a color episode of Andy Griffith"". There's no more damning phrase that can be hurled at someone attempting to be funny, IMO.Anything with Warren is painful to watch. Goober isn't funny at any time. Floyd was just about gone by then, no episode centering on Aunt Bee was worth watching in any era. Howard? Emmet? More of angular Helen Crump? Opie with pimples?No thanks.What some perceive as depth and social consciousness is to me ham handedness. Barney, Otis, Ernest T. in his prime, some of the best physical comedy seen on TV. The color episodes? ZZZZZZZZZ.I've got 1-5 and that's all. Might even skip the last episode of season 5 as it was a precursor of things to come."
2,The comedy hits the skids,"This is the beginning of the end for this delightful series. The first five years were remarkably successful; one of the best television series ever produced in the United States. Year six, featuring color, the loss of Don Knotts, and an inexplicable deterioration in the scripts, was a near disaster. The ""hicks in hollywood"" programs are especially egregious. Deputy Warren, replacing Barney Fife, is dreadful. So steer clear of this one. And the series doesn't get any better, until it sputters to a sad conclusion after year eight. Three cheers for Andy Griffith---for the first five years."
3,it's OK but.....,"not as good as when it had Barney. In my opinion, Waren is just not funny. Oh well, I'm probably still going to get this set, just for the sake of being an Andy Griffith show fan. You should get it too, but You may not like as good as the previos 5 seasons."
1,Not happy with the newest A.G seasons...,"No, it's not just you...Andy's character did change drastically. I don't care for it at all. He's not the same loving, teasing person that he was at the beginning, when the show had just started. I think having Helen be his girlfriend was a terrible mistake. Most of the time she's just going against what he says, and telling him what he should be doing. She's not a good picture of a submissive woman at all, in my opinion. My family & I can't stand episodes with her in them. She just bickers with Andy constantly. I loved the time when ""Miss Ellie"" was still around. She had spunk, but wasn't a bossy rag. =)And another thing...having Barney leave the show was really dumb. He was the life of the program! And he brought out Andy's good/funny side.Anyway, to whom it may concern: I LOVE the old black & white seasons...as for the rest, they're all just a waste of time."
2,Just not the same,"The show should have ended at Season 5. From there on out the show goes down hill and it's not just because of Barney. Barneys departure crushed the show, but also Gomers departure hurt, and the change of charchters. The show also becomes alot more dry and it's not funny at all. The first 5 seasons are remarkable, but after that the the show becomes pathetic."
2,Drastic change,"Season six is a MAJOR change for the andy griffith show...and not a good one either. The episodes are kinda hard to watch. The previous seasons always made me feel good to watch them, but in season six, Andy is short tempered, snide, argumentative and not the caring sherrif he used to be. I will probably complete my collection with the final two seasons....but, i'm in no rush to do it."
4,"Goodbye Barney, Hello . . . Angry Andy :-(","Is it just me, or did Andy's character just seem awful angry in this season? The transfer from B&W to color really doesn't put me off much, but the departure of Barney sure does. This season marked a change in Mayberry, and it is a change I don't appreciate much. I won't be purchasing the last two seasons, the show lost a great deal of charm for me in the last three seasons. However, they are still better than anything on the Tele' today. Boo Reality Television!"
2,"OOPS!! CBS should have ""Nipped it in the Bud""..","Unfortunately, when Barney left we not only lost Andy's beloved companion but we also lost Andy's benevolent character... 'Andy needed Barney' as 'Costello needed Abbott'.. I understand that Don Knotts had prior commitments with Universal Studio thinking that CBS was going to drop the TV Series but the Network decided to renew for 2 seasons as an afterthought... but alas, Deputy Fife had moved on... Andy's 'sadness' can be readily detected...Although, when Barney returned for a few episodes it did renew the 'chemistry'... still good family entertainment..."
2,Oh my god . . .do they really publish this stuff?,"That's it, I jsut can't believe it. First of all, this can't even be professional work for chrissakes! This is just terribile - artwise, storyline, etc. The truth is, EQ has simply gone downhill ever since the creators decided they were weary of doing the comics and farmed it out to abysmal talents. For example, go take a look at the ""Bedtime Stordies"" to see what I mean. ...No, they actually hired someone else to do it for them. My advice is, read it at your own risk. You may never read another EQ book again . . ."
1,The sound of dogs howling...,"I am afraid I no longer care at all for EQ and this book is one of the poorer examples of the series. Honestly, the early work was good, but the later work should be avoided. It simply isn't quality work."
3,"Good product, but too expensive here",I get this for under $5/jar at the grocery story. You'd think ordering online and in bulk it would be cheaper.
1,Expired in April,"This 3 pack deal is a total waste of money. The pads I received expired 2 months ago. They were all brown and foul smelling open opening. This store will not pay for return shipping so its not worth shipping them back for a refund. I will suck this one up as a stupid choice on my part, and order these pads from the usual ''online drugstore'' I normally do."
5,You can feel them working,"Bought this product 2 weeks ago after a recent breakout. As a guy and someone who's very busy, I never have the time or desire to sit in the bathroom applying 10 creams and face washes twice a day. These pads do a great job at cleaning your face. They're fast and you can feel them working. Skin feels smooth and clean afterward. They don't sting or irritate, all you feel is a slight tingle. They have done a great job in clearing my breakout. What impresses me the most is that they contain a lot of medication. After I'm done with my face, I can usually also apply a little bit to my shoulders and upper back, which has done wonders to clearing those areas as well. Even using them twice a day, these will last you a long time, which makes them worth the money. They're also significantly less expensive than their counterparts from other companies."
3,a commodity,"I think it's well worth buying a 64MB or, even better, this 128MB memory stick with a new Sony camera (that's what I did) but I don't see any reason to pay the premium in price between the Sony version and those made by competitors like Lexar, ScanDisk and others.Sony will tell you that part of the speed of the camera depends on the way the in-camera computer can access the memory card, but I have read articles that say that is just a tiny piece of the equation. And from experience, I can say that I see no difference in quality between my Sony card and the one from Lexar.In the end, I give this card only three stars for reasons not related to quality but to price. These memory sticks have become simple commodities, like rice or cement, and the deciding factor in any comparison shopping should be price. I would (and do) pay extra for Sony quality when it comes to digital cameras and other high-tech equipment, but I don't see a reason for it when it comes to memory sticks."
2,Awesome product. Crazy Price,I'd reccommend buying Lexar or SanDisk purely for that fact it's about almost half the cost of a Sony.
4,"Good product, bad price.","Having good storage capacity for your digital camera is a must.My Sony DSC-P72 came with a lousy 16 MB memory stick, so I was practically pushed to by this additional stick.The product itself works perfectly well. Access time is very fast. Note however that some 5MB out of the 128MB in this stick are used for internal file system structure. This leaves you with ""only"" 123MB of user memory.Unfortunatelly, the price is not good at all. Sony prices this sort of supplies very high. There are compatible products out there in the market that cost 30% less.I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the price."
3,Sony Camera Memory Stick,"Everything went okay until I tried to use it, stick it, in my computer.Haven't been able to figure out how to transfer pictures yet.However, it may be my fault.jjhjr"
1,"I not sure how this product performs, I never received it.","I would love to be able to review this product, unfortunately the company that sold it to me, ustrade, charged me 40 dollars and sent me a different, cheaper, Memory Stick and ripped me off $20. Don't buy anything from that company, they will rip you off, you've been warned."
3,Sony 128 MB Memory Stick. Good Choice?,"Depending on how many photo sticks you have and your accessibilty to a computer for quick erasure and down load, all memory sticks have a limited number of exposures. And depending on the size of your images the lower number you will get from a memory stick. Having that in mind, they are a great tool because you can edit on the spot, but unlike traditional film, you don't always know how many you are getting. And if you don't have lots of $ you most likely don't have lots of memory sticks to bring along for photo ops. Just something to keep in mind."
2,Item shown is not what was received.,The memory card shown is not what was received. What was received was a smaller size memory card with an adaptor.
4,The item shown is misleading,If you need the item that is shown and no other stick will fit. Make sure they send you the two part stick that will fit. It so happens that the two part stick they sent me worked. I purchase a two part stick at Walmart and it would not work. The one they sent me is a Sony Memory Stick Duo Adaptor MSAC-M2.
5,I like it,"I have one of these. I will be buying the two-sided ones because they have more memory, but if you are planning a short trip and don't want to take the chance on losing all of your photos, this is nice. It holds a bunch of pictures, and works faster than the ones from other companies. A great memory stick."
5,Hard to find item--great product,"In this high-tech, fast moving world, it is hard to keep any item longer than a couple of years before things become obsolete. I was therefore glad to find an old Sony Memory Stick that fit my old Sony digital camera from 2002. I wish there were more memory on it, but the old cameras do not accept the new sticks, so I will just have to make do with what is possible."
5,Don't judge book by its cover,"While the product image didn't match the product delivered (photos is regular Sony 128 mb Memory Stick and product received was the Sony 128 mb Memory Stick Duo), it was still in orignal packaging (brand new) and performed as expected with added benefit of the Stick Duo sheath which will hold larger capacity memory sticks. Very prompt delivery. I would definitely order this product and from this vendor again."
3,"Good, but dry!","Yes, this book has been very well researched. But is it extremely dry. No commentaries at all, just variations. If you are a player above 2000 ELO, you will find no fault with it. But if (like me) you need some explanation about the plans for each side, you will be left pretty much on your own."
2,"Works, But very noisey after 2 months",Fasco needs to do some quality control on it bearings and design. This is my second Fasco motor in a year. The first one the bearings in the motor went bad at 11 months and now this replacement motor works but after 2 months of use it is so loud that I have to turn the tv up very high just to listen. This motor is going back and will try again. I will try to find another supplier for the motors for my pellet stove...tired of replacing motors. If anyone from FASCO reads this..give me a call ..I have works in the electronics field for 30 years...This is a poor product...no need of this type of problems with a simple electrical motor.
5,Worked great and fit perfect,Bought for a replacement for the room blower in my older Whitfield pellet stove and it fit perfectly and works great. This made me Very happy!
2,Gamers beware...,"Okay to Gamers this is a GREAT deal... two batteries, and docking station to charge both batteries plus get the cable to charge the battery already in your controller... Well, here is the problem... I looked all over the box... it doesn't say anywhere how much input came be put in there... 110V?? or 220V?? Who knows... My guess don't chance it... make sure you plug it into the 110V with your Xbox 360..."
1,Skip this 3rd Party power kit,"I picked this combo power kit because it was the deal of the day and I thought it'd be a descent performer considering the cost... Well I should have just put down the extra 10 bucks to get the Official Microsoft quick charge kit because the batteries are made of a casing design that is too large for the controller that I think it may have created a crack on one my controller because the batteries have to be placed in so tight. Additionally, the charger dock does not allow for charging of the official microsoft batteries unless extra pressure is placed on top so that the metal connectors touch (this is probably due to the oversided nature of the nyko kit).I would advise anyone, unfortunately, pay the extra money for the official charge kit or use generic AA rechargable batteries instead of this harmful product. For me, the batteries and charge station is in the trash, but I'm keeping the play and charge cord piece - i hope that'll work right."
1,Russian roulette with your money...,"Bought this from Wal-mart for $30. Works on the wireless controller that came with my system no problem, but would flash green lights on the new Microsoft controller I just bought. A google search showed that Microsoft did a small redesign on their wireless controller, which affects certain 3rd party batteries (like Nyko's). Nyko is in the process of releasing compatible batteries and replacing the old ones I bought, but it is utterly pointless to buy this just to save a few dollars.Save yourself the headache and just buy the Microsoft-brand Quick Charge Kit and Play & Charge cable. These together cost you $40.98, which is a whole $1 more than this piece of crap."
1,dose not charge well,it seems like a good deal until you get it home and you realize it dose not charge well. the batteries do not fit into the charger so you have to fiddle with them to get them to charge and then they tend to stop charging after a few seconds. not worth the hastle.
4,Great Pictures,"Good Camera..very Handy and good styling..get noticed..very where. But now after doing about 10 rolls , feels that Shutter Speed Setting Adjustment should be present, like in Manual Cameras..You wont probably use the LT Mode unless you have bought yourself a Tripod.Good Entry level SLR Camera.Unless you want to go for N65 which cost [money] Mmore.. this camera is good"
2,Only lasted 15 months...,"This camera takes quality pictures, but we did not find it to be very well constructed. The diopter (view finder adjustment) stopped working in the first 90 days, and the film advance mechanism failed about one year later. We take a lot of pictures, but do not treat the camera roughly. Even with the instructions, we were not able to make the ""date-stamp"" work correctly. My wife also had occassional trouble loading the film. The optics seem to be good, but overall we were un-impressed. We were able to get a full refund using an extended warranty offered through our credit card provider. We originally paid about $150 brand new."
4,Slippery little devil,"I agree with other reviewers that this foil cutter works well once it's actually in place on the bottle capsule. It's also sturdy--I know, because I've dropped mine at least 50 times. That's because it is not only small (1 3/4 by 1 1/4 inches--smaller than the illustration) but also tapered at an angle that makes it hard to grip when removing it from the base. I'm dropping it less often now that I've figured out that it is best stuck to the top and not the side of the refrigerator door, but I'm still in the market for a foil cutter that doesn't sacrifice ease of use to sleek looks."
5,Magnetic Foil Cutter is Great!,The best thing about this foil cutter is the magnetic back - I had been looking for another one for 6 months! We just love it!
5,A Hillarious Classic Dose of Dilbert,"This book is a classic compilation of comic strips in the days that were not so focused on business. Dogbert can be seen more than the current strips doing other things besides consulting, and a glimpse of Dilbert's personal life is seen. Alice, Catbert, and Asok were not characters yet, and the boss hadn't been quite fully developed, but getting there. However, the pointy-haired boss is still a main and hillarious character, along with Dilbert's lazy colleague, Wally, and the many annoying co-workers that fill up the office."
3,Very long movie,"At 1 hour, 51 minutes, this movie is in no hurry to get to the end. I guess Depression-era audiences were happy to sit in a cool theater that long. Scenes are long, slow, and drawn out, like in real life. Claudette Colbert is is no hurry to move along to the next scene. And why should she when she doesn't age a bit in the 15 years this movie spans? And doesn't Warren William look like John Barrymore!! Same profile. If you are a fan of the Lana Turner version, you really ought to see this."
3,Great Double Feature. Great Value. Disappointing Transfers,"I was very excited to hear about the release of the two versions of Imitation Of Life together on the same DVD. I had never seen the 1934 version and found it to be an equally enjoyable film as the 1959 one, although quite different (the main character is an entrepreneur versus an actress in the '59 version). The transfer for the 1934 version is decent considering it's age. I was more disappointed with the 1959 one. Granted, it was filmed in Eastman Color so one could not expect Technicolor brilliance, but the transfer is grainy and faded. To make matters worse, the layer change occurs at the worst possible place, as someone is running down the stairs (as with all DVD's, there is a slight pause at that time). This is very jarring; what was the engineer thinking? Layer changes ideally should be placed between a fade-out and a fade-in of scenes. Considering the price and the content, I would reccomend this DVD if you can ignore it's flaws."
5,Imitation of Life 1934/1959: GREAT COLLECTOR ITEM,"I love the movie Imitation of Life. Although I had never seen the 1934 version before, I loved just as much I did the 1959 version. I watch this movie all the time and think that it's a movie that everyone should see. The message that the movie shows just how hard and the lengths that people will go to fit in into a society that tells them that they must look and act a certian way. This is a item that everyone should have in their DVD collection and I reccommand it to everyone."
5,Imitation Of Life,"I saw the first version of this movie when I was a child and have enjoyed all the other versions and take offs from it. The message it gives is that you cannot take anything or anybody for granted, because you never know where you will receive a blessing and how your life will turn out because of it."
5,I love this classic,"I cry every time I watch this movie, the poor mother try so hard to please her daughter but when her mother is gone then she reqlizes what she lost, I cannot stand her selfish dauhter, yes I know it's a movie but I take to heart every time."
5,The original is breathtaking -- the remake not so much,"The original with Claudette Colbert is an INCREDIBLE movie.... It is difficult to believe that racism was dealt with so directly and sensitively in a film from 1934.What makes it so powerful is that the white characters -- the main character here being Clodette Colbert -- are not evil (as in the 1959 remake of this movie, which I think loses its edge, because the white characters ARE evil) -- but rather just being the way white people were -- so this is a commentary much more on social norms rather than individual attitudes.But it is also a powerful commentary on how black people saw themselves in those days. The dark skinned mother with the light-skinned daughter who could pass for white. One shot, when Claudette Colbert is going upstairs to her bedroom, and Loiuse Beavers is going downstairs to her bedroom.... incredibly powerful."
5,best movie,"I have always loved this movie, I have it on VHS, but was so happy to find it on DVD, I if you have never seen this movie you should purchasing was so easy, and it arrived sooner then the time quoted, a friend at work who is very much younger then I wants to borrow it. Thanks Amazon"
5,Amazing movies,This movie makes me cry so hard. Beautiful messages in both versions. Performances were stellar. The condition of the DVD was top quality. I recommend this to ANYONE.
3,the after thought,"This movie was about a few things. It was about the struggles of being milado, while only looking of a white race. AS well as the struggles of a young white mother in her career that ultimately both women, the black and the white help eachother and prosper fully. My review is actually for the people who saw both versions of this movie. The one in the 50's and this 1930's version. I read the reviews on both versions, and usually I enjoy the older movies more, or the first ones made, but I actually felt that the version made in the 1950's was more dramatic and I felt the emotion that I was supposed to feel on a deeper level. The actors and actreses were a better fit for the part and the story line was more in depth. I would recommend the 1950's version over the original any day."
2,"Outdated, but if you've never seen it - check it out.","I have to say I'm only giving this version 2 stars when I would give the 1959 remake 5, because unfortunantely I had seen the 1959 remake hundreds of times (and still cry) before finally seeing the original. I was very disappointed. I found it to be old fashioned and outdated, not to mention so ""politically incorrect"" that it distracted from my enjoyment of the film. I'll admit it is a little unfair to compare it to the remake, but everytime I hear that little girl call Delilah ""HORSIE"", I wanna take a sledge hammer to the TV screen!!My advice is if at all possible see this version before you see the better 1959 remake."
4,Interesting and Enjoyable,"I prefer this version to the more famous later version. ""Aunt Delilah"" didn't bother me. I think the character was realistic about how to live in those times. It's nice to watch this movie because it's preWW2 and there's an authentic Japanese male pancake customer with his own style and speech pattern because that was just a part of the American landscape at that time."
4,Imitation of Life,"Old but very interesting movie. It shows how people of different races try to be someone they aren't and the tragedy of realizing a mistake when it's too late to rectify it. Also it shows how strong a mother's love for her child is in spite of being rejected by the child.Even though this is an old movie, I had never viewed it but found it very interesting, enjoyable and a valuable lesson about life."
5,Imitation of Life DVD set,"I bought this purely for the 1934 version, I've been waiting for this DVD a long time.Everything about the 1934 version is better then the 1959 especially the acting from Colbert and Beavers (Lana Turner might be eye candy but she can't act and Sandra Dee is silly as ever) this movie is not dated, how can a movie set in the 1930s and made in the 1930s be dated????? its how things were then DAHHH!For whatever version YOU like this is a nice DVD set (a few extras would have been nice tho)"
5,Colbert vs Turner Five Stars for Each,"Imitation of Life (the Lana Turner) version is one of my favorite movies. I always watch it on television when it is on and like my mother did to me I got my daughter hooked on it also. I never knew there was an original version, so when I saw this special edition, I had to have it. I am happy to say, I found the original Colbert version just as entertaining and enjoyed the black and white movie along with the black screen pauses in between. I also loved that the ""claim to fame"" was a different theme than the Lana Turner version which made the movie that much more enjoyable. The original version is as much a ""tear jerker"" as the Turner version. I give this special edition five stars."
5,Just be yourself,"I had no interest in these movies until my dad told me I needed to watch them. Being a mixed female (black dad, white mom) he told me that these were important movies for the time they were shown. I would reccomend these movies for anybody of any race. Besides the fact they are entertaining, They show a message to just be yourself, because you don't know who or how you can hurt someone, in the 1959 version, Sarah Jane was so mean to her mother and her mother was so good to her. I have watched it so many times I can't even count, and each time it never gets old. Another good film of this genre is to watch ""I Passed for White""."
5,Imitation of Life,"The quality of the two movies is excellent. Although, I would have preferred to have had two DVDs instead of a double sided DVD."
1,itchy mess,"Sorry to bring down the glowing reviews for this bar...however this made my face ITCH like no other! At first I thought this cleans my face really well..but then when I patted my face dry I felt a thin residue on my face that was difficult to rinse off, which I think was the cause of the the itchniness. Or perhaps I had reaction to one of the ingredients..who knows? I really wanted to like this bar..however it just did not work for me! Perhaps it is best for people that do not have hypersensitive skin like me. This is promptly getting chucked in the garbage, good thing it was dirt cheap off of amazon!"
3,Okay not great,"I got this for my husband thinking that we could set the temperature that we wanted, but there is not an option for this. Overall I would have payed more for a better one then this average thermometer."
3,HATED BY MANY,"TRACK 2: MONEY CAN'T BUY YOU LOVE, IS A SONG THAT I CAN LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN."
2,not very good,this cd isnt that good young dre isnt that good the only good song is put that on somethin an even still its not that good if u like rare westcoast rap cd's dont buy this. i bought it for like 2.99 at a store used and lol thats about all i would recommend neone spend on it def dont pay 25$ i dont care if it is rare thats a huge ripoff
1,"""HATED BY MANY"" INDEED","This is one of the worst westcoast and/or rap albums I ever been unfortunate enough to listen to. After bumpin this in your ride, you will attract attention. In fact, you will become the joke of your neighborhood and some1 might ssip in your gas tank. Dre is obviously a very hated man, and after listening to this piece of trash, you will understand why. His flow reminds me of an old washed-up chain-smoking hooker who is trying to speak with all of her holes plugged up. BOTTOM LINE: Pistol whip the elohssa who sells you this garbage."
1,don't buy,i think this was the worst thing that i have ever brought. we have five dog at home so wanted something so that we don't need to fill up so much and when i saw this i thought that it looked great so i order two. but when they got here we filled them up and all of the water came out of the bottom. we could not find any way of making any water stay in the bottle. so i am now going to find some elsePS if i could i would not even give it one star :(
2,Marginally functional,"I purchased this feeder at a local big box for my single cat. It fills easily and usage requires little explanation. However, it only functions marginally well. As another reviewer noted, the food does not refill the bowl well. I often come home and find the food kind of stuck at the back of the bowl. A little jiggle to the whole device gets the food to come out. A paw to the food might work as well, but apparently my cat doesn't seem to do this. (Despite being HUNGRY!) The food I am using in it is Purina Complete Care. Perhaps the food shape is a factor, but I think the feed ramp is just not steep enough. YMMV.Update:I tried a different food (Science Diet) which is a very small pellet type food. Food still does not fill the bowl well. Leaving the review at two stars."
2,Spills,I have this in blue but my cat manages to knock the food out everywhere around the bowl until more food is piles up around the thing than in it. A bigger base would help.
1,Cheap and Unuseable,"The plastic on this item is so thin and misaligned that the parts won't stay together, let alone hold anything. Avoid this brand."
4,Back to Storytelling,"In Falling Sideways, Tom Holt has returned to storytelling. He is good at random quipping, but I felt that some of the books he cranked out in recent years- Overtime, Faust Among Equals, and Grailblazers- were long on random quips and short on plot. Falling Sideways is a good yarn- it almost develops like a creepy mystery at the beginning. The funny bits are in service of the plot,and not as fast and furious as in some of the earlier books, which might disappoint some, but I found a relief. The book is perhaps not quite as satisfying as Expecting Someone Taller or Who's Afraid of Beowolf? but does suggest that Holt is past his lazy phase or whatever that was, and bodes well for the future."
2,Poor Man's Douglas Adams,"I am a big fan of the late Douglas Adams, and have enjoyed the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ""trilogy"" as well as his Dirk Gently books, mostly because of his crazily funny sense of dry humor and wit. The big difference between those books and this one by Tom Holt (and I won't generalize my comments to Holt, since I've only read this book of his, but likely won't read the others because of this one) is that Adams balanced the silliness with entertaining dialog and description, whereas Holt uses a sledgehammer to bang you over the head, line after line, paragraph after paragraph, with the same kind of silliness that Adams used less liberally to greater effect.I give it two stars, rather than one, because it is clearly an homage to Adams (with references sprinkled about to Hitchhikers text which, I assume and hope, are there for the sake of mimicry rather than plagiarism), and hey, I can appreciate a good tribute."
1,Hmm.,"As one reviewer has said, this is the poor man's version of ""Hitchhiker's Guide"".As another has said, it tries too hard to be funny.Although the beginning was enough to sucker me into reading, after twenty pages (or less) it devolves into something of a peculiar nightmare - weird, but not in a good way, and painfully silly. It's something like Douglas Adams mixed with Paul Jennings, and then left to fester for a good couple of years. Yeah, it's not very good.I can't even remember the last half of the novel, if that's any indication of its sticking ability."
3,"Funny at times, but not what its cracked out to be","Falling Sideways in an interesting experiment in writing comic urban fantasy, unfortunately while the theory is sound, Tom Hold can't manage to drive the point home.I've read a couple of other Tom Hold and, unlike other books from the author, Falling Sideways is rather funny and have some hilarious moments but it the more you get into it you start to see the rather coarse seems that attempt to hold the plot together, but eventually fail miserably.If you're up for a few laughs, Falling Sideways is better then most other Tom Holt's works - but don't expect it to hold a candle to the masters of the genre."
2,I would not buy/read it again,"Farewell to Prague -- The story almost seemed like a fairy tale........one ""over-the-top"" happening after another; descriptions were rather excessive too."
1,Erratic Performance,"Frequently the booklight is not able to be illuminated when using the adapter - it seems to require either a ""warm-up"" (turning booklight off and then on again) before the booklight turns on - at times, even that procedure is unsuccessful - I have also had to first insert batteries to turn on the book light and then remove the batteries to use the adapter which then seems to work ok - also, even when I can use the adapter successfully, the booklight is not nearly as bright (when using the adapter) as it is when using batteries."
3,Not the right adaptor!,"As best as I can tell by enlarging the view of the Itty Bitty adaptor, the output voltage is 3 volts designed for a two cell lamp. Unfortunately, the Phorm fluorescent book light (four cell) requires 5 volts! I know this because I have a Phorm power supply with that rating. Three volts may suffice to keep the lamp on once lit and warmed, however, the voltage is too low to kick it off. Itty Bitty is probably a fine device when used correctly!"
1,Itty Bitty Booklite adaptor,I am now the owner of a useless power adaptor - the voltage in Australia is 240 not 120 as supplied. Very annoyed. Isn't there any quality control? Or common sense?
1,not the right adapter for zelco book light,"not the right adapter for zelco book light. this is for the ""audio"" version"
5,Itty Bitty Book Lite AC Adaptor,This works fine. A good value on Amazon. $25 book light would be useless without it.
1,still waiting,Amazon shipped the wrong product. I'm still waiting to receive the correct one. Thanks.
3,Lack of customer support.,"This latch does not come with a template for drilling your door.I contacted the manufacturer and they assigned a case number, but after a week I still haven't received a follow up to my request.Also a bit pricey for the quality of construction."
5,Lock and load!,"This is a great cable.Lots of good shielding, metal shells for the connection points, and little rubber grips on the heads.The locking feature works well, especially if you have enough room around the cable tip to easily turn it (turning the shell tightens the grip and ""locks"" it on). If there are lots of nearby cables this can sometimes be difficult.I use this cable for applications where the connector may inadvertently pull off when shifting components around."
1,Too much hashish,"Ali Khan is magnificent when singing in the traditional way. This was horrid, I threw it away. Cheap synthesizers and drum machines."
4,Fantastic,I don't have time to review each book independently but wanted to share some ratings of several books I consider outstanding. Happy reading!
5,willy,"It's a gem. Worked great right out of the box. Software is easy to use also. Came with two compactflash cards total of 96MB. Came with flash card writer, car ac adapter, car cassette so you can play through the car stereo and very good and comfortable headset. It is also a FM radio. I was happy with the price. I would have paid more as it is such a complete package. Battery life is good on two AA batteries. Sound quality is great and it has an equalizer to set personnel preference or opt for one of the many pre sets, jazz, pop, rock, bass ... No skips as it has no moving parts. A true go anywhere portable sound machine. You will love it."
2,NOT an MP3 player!,"Be warned! The Lyra 2 is NOT an MP3 player. It requires that you use custom, encrypted MPX files. You CAN NOT drag and drop MP3's to this device, eliminating one of the main advatages of CompactFlash."
5,Better than expected!,"This MP3 player came with more features and peripherals than expected. It is easy to use and the MusicMatch Jukebox software has been great for copying files to memory cards. Any reviews that mention trouble with the software are end-user problems. It is light weight, does not use rechargeable batteries too quickly and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Simple to use, great sound and performance!","After 5 minutes (i took 5 minutes to install and ""study"" the pc software) i got my first fantastic play list, sounding reeeeally good and transmitting very fast :)the connection PC-Flashcard is fast (5-7 seconds per song), the directory organization of player's internal software is really great. The Radio Fm system is good, but i must try it better.fantastic!dav"
4,Real One Upgrade No Longer Supports The Lyra,"I basically think that the Lyra is one of the best MP3 players I've owned. I purchased it when it first came out then switched to the Rio (huge disappointment). What I liked about the Lyra is how you could add music to the flash card by clicking and dragging the songs from RealJukebox!! I cannot tell you how disappointed I am now that the upgrade for RealJukebox, which is called RealOne, does not support the Lyra. So far I have been unsuccessful in using MusicMatch to manage the music on the Lyra."
1,Paradoxical Player,"The player's quality is good, the features excellent. Playing songs from the Compact flash card is easy and convenient.Here is the problem: How to get the songs on the card. RCA / Thomson Multimedia implemented a 'security' mechanism that allows you to transfer files (MP3/G2/WMA) only with the music management system delivered with the player. It takes - on my computers - 45 to 50 minutes to load one (1!) hour (64MB) onto the card. Since Compact Flash Cards cannot be considered as cheap removable media one has to 'reuse' the card. Given this fact 45 minutes to download music to the card is unacceptable.I am curious about the second generation of the iPod. Until then I will rarely listen to music with my Lyra2 since I don't have the time to download new titles to the card."
1,What a piece of crud!,"I bought this player after reasearching it on the internet. 64 MB memory, FM radio, and pretty [inexpensive]. I got it home, used it for one day (!) and the player broke. A button was broken and something went wrong with the firmware inside. Took it back, got a different one. Didn't work when I got it out of the box. Kept getting internal errors. If I were an educated consumer, I would not buy this. Get an mp3 player that WORKS. Not this one..."
2,MAC OS X USERS BE WARNED!!!,While I do like this little machine it wont get a higher rating because it currently does not work under OS X. If you are running OS X it wont work. the compact flash card is not seen in the software musicmatch. And Musicmatch is so buggy it is not even funny. If you do buy this machine and have problems dont expect support from music match if you have not bought the full version. Hopefully in later versions of the software OS X will be supported. Otherwise dont bother with it
5,Its AWESOME!!!!,"This mp3 player is just awesome. When i first opened the box it was soo easy to instal it . It comes 2 softwares, music match box and Realjukebox . It takes like 5 seconds to get a song on it. It can hold about 20 songs. It also has an awesome remote that looks awesome and is almost too easy too use . this comes with an external drive so that means u can take the memory out of it and put it into the Docking station and put songs on it. This is a must get mp3 player. its worth every penny. the only problem with it is that sometimes u cant receive signals from ur favorite radio station but other than that its a beauty!"
4,"If you loved it when you were young, you'll love it more now.","He's a romantic, he sings the songs of a man from the 50's with the 50's attitude, the way it was and should still be."
5,Dave Loggins is the one of the finest singers/songwriters,"I grew up in the 1970's and that was the peak of such musical talents as Cat Stevens, James Taylor, CSN&Y, Jim Croce, Harry Chapin to name a few. Dave Loggins was an incredible talent and was never given his due, at least among the public; I would bet that within the industry they knew he was a supreme talent. Perhaps he found a home in the Smoky Mountains with his girl from Knoxville and gave up chasing the bright lights. He is an amazing artist."
5,The good side of tomorrow,"The song Please Come To Boston had been playing in my head for weeks, I must have heard it on the radio. Anyway since I bought the CD I have played it about 10 times and I love the rest of the album also...."
4,Masters Theme,"I don't know if the guy who posted last year is still looking, but I've been looking for the instrumental version used on the CBS Masters broadcasts for years now to no avail."
4,My Father's fiddle ??,How could My Father's fiddle get overlooked ? The best work of his career has to be the Apprentice album ! That needs to be released on it's own.
2,Magnum Year Seven DVD,"I bought this DVD because the average rating for viewers was very high. However, I was disappointed. Many of the episodes just made no sense at all and seemed disconnected. For example, the episode in which TC's daughter is kidnapped. There was no explanation as to why or to how the kidnappers knew to call the ""estate"". The episodes just seemed ""too heavy"", ridden with emotion that often made no sense. Give me year one through four- those were the absolute best!!"
3,Nice if you are a Magnum fan,"I bought this for my wife who found the first 6 seasons at a garage sale and paid $30 for all. Felt I needed to complete her set by buying season 7 and 8. I remember watching Magnum P.I. when it was a hit show. Somewhat corney now, but my wife likes it and it is better than some of the other hit shows of that era. Amazon had the best price for a new set, so went with Amazon. If you have any of the sets and need to complete it, Amazon will probably be the best place to buy."
5,Magnum PI all at once--GREAT,"I have always been a Tom Selleck fan, so Magnum PI was one of my favorite shows when I was younger. Was wonderful to see the whole ""Magnum gang"" again. Ah, the memories...."
4,Great DVD,I purchased this DVD to continue my Magnum collection. I think it is great and the quality of the DVD is excellent. The episodes bring back memories of happy times. Good job. I just wish the other Magnum DVD weren't so expensive.
4,"Good, But Bare Bones As Usual","All the shows are faithfully represented, in attractive packaging. Finally, there are a couple of minor ""Special Features"" that are a little bit entertaining, but nothing to write home about."
4,"""Murder By Night"" altered","The B&W episode ""Murder By Night"" is presented in this DVD set primarily in color. The episode, a node to old film noir, was presented in a B&W format in both first run and syndication. Why is it presented here in color? Horrible oversight or bad decision? Either way, what a shame it couldn't have been presented properly."
2,quickly sun damaged,the sticker is starting to peel and crack at the edges in just a couple months. my car is nearly always garaged. it won't last 6 months at this rate...
2,black ripple sole jungle boots,"These boots cause more damage to my feet then not... I have yet to break them in, but I cannot sacrifice my feet further in order to see if the boots will ever be comfortable as they were said to be. I like jungle boots for their breathability; but these cut me up at all the seams and leave my arches feeling flat. I will wear them only around the camp site, like jungle 'crocs'."
1,shoe shine,"I bought these boots because i wore nothing but jungle boots since i was in service nearly a decade ago. They seem exactly the same as the $100 pairs that I would get on base except for one major thing amazon.com fails to mention....When you shine these boots they will look beautiful right up until you wear them around. Then you notice the shine actually cracks and falls off. I spent over 8 hrs bringing these boots up to my shine standard and it falls off!? Not once but twice!For ANY MILITARY PERSONNEL, DO NOT BUY THESE BOOTS!!!If you just want a cheap pair of g.i. look-a-like boots then these may satisfy you.p.s.The problem is most likely this: Made in China."
5,Timbiriche is great,Yo lo escuchava cuando era pequena porque mis hermanos lo escuchavan y hoy que salieron nuevamente I think is great They should have a lot of expectators.
4,Kept me awake reading!,This book grabbed me from the begining--through its twists and turns and his ending was good. Just wish it was longer! And sometime during that night I lost a bracelet that I've worn for five years! Strange! Wish I had a dream machine!
3,feeling ugly,"There is value in reading this book. It is a peek into a different world, but it was not worth the bad feelings that lingered every time I put the book down."
4,Dry but illuminating,"The book is organized into short vignettes describing various operations, such as convoy ambushes, undertaken by the Mujahideen with short critiques of effectiveness. It is interesting only to those who might like to study guerrilla tactics and deployment of fighters and weapons as used in Afghanistan. It is intended as a textbook for officer and leader training."
2,Not what I expected,Reads like an after action report; step by step. Good military small unit leader stuff. Not for a historian or someone who wants a broader look at the Afghan conflict
3,Find a Copy-DVD Release?!,"I viewed this on a DVD from the Los Angeles Public Library.Amazing historical piece of Hollywood science fiction history.Hopefully, it will get re-issued on DVD and be available on AMAZON. You can certainly see how George Lucas ""borrowed"" may elements for STAR WARS. The themes and icons are similar!!!!Love the hokey special effects like the limping fire cracker rockets. But this fascinated kids and even as an adult I got wrapped up in the adventure, including space rockets. Man, I would love a Director's Commentary on this story!!! Ancient Hollywood History here."
4,Great phone but not perfect for me.,"This is a great phone, the sound quality is good, and it has all the features you would expect from the top of the line multi-extension cordless phones plus several which I haven't seen on other systems. There were a couple of features that ruined this system for me. First the tone dialing is not directly connected to the button press, i.e. you can not control the length of the tone while dialing. This is a problem for me since I have some dialing features that require I send a tone for over a second (hold the number key down for over a second). The other feature I wish this system had is to display the phonebook name on the caller id rather than the caller id name i.e. ""Mom"" would display instead of ""DOE, JANE"". I use a Dock-N-Talk for my main phone line Phonelabs DNT01 Wireless. The features that were missing from this phone means I can't use the system for speed dialing, voice dialing, and displays all names as ""DOCK N TALK"". I am returning the phone."
2,OK not great,"I've had the phone for about a week now, including the optional Bluetooth Mobile Phone Link.Pros: Stylish than most. Build & sound quality.Cons: When using the base speakerphone and you pick up the handset from the base, it DOES NOT switch to the handset. Major annoyance.Buttons are little stiff, maybe I was just used to my previous setup.My previous setup was a Panasonic KX-TC1881B 2 line 900MHz DSS speakerphone. The Motorola was supposed replace my Panasonic, but I think not. Too bad, I do like the stylish design & the optional bluetooth link."
5,Great Cordless Phone,"For the past several years I've sworn by Panasonic, but the last few cordless phones have inexplicably stopped working. I purchased this for my mother as a Christmas present because her other phone was water damaged. She asked me to set it up and I was amazed at how hi-end this phone was. She loves it, so now I;m thnking that I should get one too; a great buy."
2,NOT ALL THAT.....,"I AM A TRUE, FULL-BLOODED STAND UP COMEDY FANATIC!!! ALTHOUGH I AM NOT A DIE HARD FAN OF ALEX THOMAS I DO RESPECT HIS EFFORTS. I EXPECTED MORE FROM HIM BEING THAT HE HAS BEEN IN THE GAME FOR MORE THAN 10+ YEARS. THIS DVD WAS NOT MUCH BETTER THAN HIS PCS DVD ""STRAIGHT CLOWNIN'"" WHICH WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL (-0). I DID GET A COUPLE (AND ONLY A COUPLE)OF CHUCKLES IN THIS ONE. ALEX FOCUSED MORE ON TRYING TO TALK/SOUND LIKE TUPAC WHEREAS HIS FOCUS SHOULD'VE BEEN ON DELIVERING FUNNIER JOKES. I HAVE TRIED TO LIKE THIS CAT AND SUPPORT HIM BUT IT'S JUST PLAIN AND SIMPLE.....HE IS NOT FUNNY!!!!! LEGALIZE BOOTLEGGIN'!!!!"
1,NOT for younger children,"Not for younger children, as it gratuitously displays and describes dogs in the act of mating. This adds nothing to the book, as small children love dogs, but would be less likely to be dog breeders at the ages of, for example 6 or 7, and as such do not need to view such explicit depictions. Also, adults can pretty much already identify those acts (especially) in fellow mammals when they see them, and so this adds nothing for them, either."
5,Pre-organized food journal,I love all three of Chef Kathleen's books. This book is nice because it can serve as a tool for keeping track of how you are doing on your weight loss plan. If you are interested in food journaling and want an organized format this book is great. It also contains some of her wonderful recipes. There are also some nutrition facts and answers to questions emailed to her. It is a tool and will only help if you use it.
3,Scratches easily but they're not too visible,I used a pair of tweezers to try to get these on: bad idea! Scratched it but it's not too noticeable! Will be buying more
2,Disappointing,"Box itself is well constructed. Music, however, is disappointing. Could hardly tell what the tune was (wouldn't have known had I not been told) and the tune itself was VERY short and repeating. I ended up returning the box and getting a different one for $10 - which I'm happier with."
5,the best in the world,I love using these oxy pads it makes my face cleaner smoother. I have no dirt on my face what-so-ever. I never have to use a bar of soap ever again.
1,Poor Product,"This MP3 Player only lasted two weeks in my possession. Despite new batteries, the unit never played another tune after limited use. Would not recommend this for a purchase. Now I guess I know why it was 47% off the regular price."
3,RCA 64,"Many problems with XP.Software [is not good]Sound quality is not great. Lots of ""skipping"" sounds.I might return it.But nice and small.Do research on other players"
3,Nice and small,I found the RCA Kazoo to be very small and light weight. I had lots of problems trying to delete songs for the player once I downloaded them using the musicmatch jukebox software that is included.
2,DOESN'T WORK ON MY WINDOWS XP MACHINE,"Even thought I got this thing FREE after rebates with the purchase of Windows XP, even though the Install disk says Windows XP, Windows XP tells you when you try to install it that it is NOT CERTIFIED to run on Windows XP. I figured it must run OK nonetheless, since the Install disk says XP and it came free with Windows XP, but it doesn't on my machine.In fact, even though the player shows up when you plug it in on the taskbar, the software doesn't recognize it. Windows Media Player doesn't see it either.The USB cable is too short if you have a tower machine. It doesn't even reach to the counter."
3,Disappointed - poor quality construction for daily gym use,"The sound quality of this MP3 player is OK. In my opinion, not as good as Rio's, but certainly nice. However, doesn't hold up to daily gym use. To use the arm band that comes with it, the player must be inside its slick plastic envelope. Unfortunately, the snaps on the plastic envelope tear easily, leaving you without an arm band option. I can live with that. HOWEVER, now the plastic housing around the battery case has cracked, so the batteries can't make contact. Epoxy held it together for a week or so, but no longer. I've never dropped this unit, and keep it in a padded neoprene bag when I'm not using it. You know there's something wrong with the design of this RCA unit when my original Rio 300 player is still going strong."
3,Good Player...but with Faults,"Not a bad player for the price, I paid [money] for an open box at [a store] and at that price its definitely worth it. Its compact, nice looking and has above average sound for the price. I found it easy to use once it was set up, but have concerns about XP compatibility. I was able to download an update at Music Match, but it is not recognized by other software on my XP machine (I prefer Sony's Sonic Stage for my MP3 collection). I've been forced to switch to Musicmatch which I don't really like. Deleting songs from the player also could be faster, but all in all, to get 64mb under [money] with good sound isn't bad at all"
2,Buy something else,"The case for this is terrible, the little snaps are extremely annoying, and they tear out within a week. So after the case broke I was using this little strap they give you, but using the strap broke off the corner by the battery case. I never dropped this or did anything that should have broken it. It is just really poorly made.That, plus the fact that you have to use MusicMatch, makes me recommend not purchasing this device. MusicMatch is a horrible program.Oh, one more thing. You can only fit about 5 songs on this the way it comes, so you have to cough up another 50 bucks for a memory card. Its not a very good deal."
4,this is great,"I have been considering getting an mp3 player for a while, except i was never really impressed by the size of all of them out there. i think the first small ones I saw were the panasonic ones, but they were around 300 dollars. the size and the price impressed me as well as the ability to expand with mmc cards.The controls are simple but what else do i need besides play, stop, forward, back? it sounds great but I recommend getting different headphones, i found the ones it came with uncomfortable.The little plastic case could be better. I would prefer a leather one.There is support for windows xp, but everyone looks in the wrong place. Don't look at the RCA site but the MusicMatch site.This would be even better if I could download mp3 to the computer form the player itself.I would recommend this player to anyone who wants a small basic mp3 player for a small price."
4,"Good, except for MusicMatch ...","I don't think there's anything I can say about the player that hasn't been said already - it's great!My only beef is that they include MusicMatch on the CD for uploading music to the player. As soon as I installed MM, it started nagging me for my personal info .. WTF? Not only that, but everytime I'd shut down the program, it would constantly nag me to update to the ... version which had a bunch of extras that I didn't need or want. I finally went and downloaded ... for the program just so it would leave me alone."
4,Your basic MP3 player,"I like my little MP3. I've been wanting one and asked for this one for Christmas because it's cheap. Yeah, the 32MB of memory is not alot. At near CD-quality--96kb--I was able to fit nine songs on my first try. But three of those songs are over eight minutes long. (I also got Led Zeppelin Early and Later Years for Christmas!) Recently loads to the device give me about 12 normal songs. Not much, but enough. It was very handy while traveling and has stood up to several workout so far. I think I'll buy the extra memory.The software that it came with could use some improvement. I had to go online and get the program from the company that makes it? Why? The program on the included CD didn't work. All in all it took me about two hours to get music loaded and running. Not terrible, but certainly not plug-n-play.Bottom line? If I had the bucks, I'd buy a player that comes with more memory. But this is still an emerging technology and a good, inexpensive way to get in on the fun."
4,xp drivers,"We purchased a Kazoo for our daughter at Christmas because of it's size and memory size. The price was good as well. We are running xp and like other people foud out, the drivers were not compatible. I spent many days searching the internet for drivers and e-mailed rca. The response was that they are in the process of making/building drivers but did not know when they would be available. I then had a friend search for the drivers and he did find them. So, I am happy to say that we can run the Kazoo with windows xp. The only other comment I have is that the batteries do not seem to last long."
4,"For what it does, it does it well...","Considering the price, one should expect a rather simple product. This is what is given. I reiterate someone else by saying there is no compatibility with XP, thus maybe you should read the box. For those of us who can use it, it works great, to me at least. People are complaining that it scratches if it drops. Maybe you shouldn't be dropping it... Nonetheless.. I agree, I hate musicmatch, which is the lone reason I DID NOT give it 5 stars. The headphones are faulty, which is the cause for many of the sound problems, try new ones. Otherwise, again, for what it does, it does it well."
4,Now I have to get one for my husband....,"I purchased the last one of these in my town. Then I made the mistake of showing it to my husband. Now he wants one. I studied the reviews on the MP3 players and then I figured what the heck and tried this one.Set-up and the first download took about 30 minutes (on a Windows ME machine.) On the windows XP machine it was a little more challenging, I had to update Musicmatch, then update the drivers. The RCA site had good support and led me to the download. I'm still fiddling with what would be the best sampling rate for sound quality. Definitely buy a card, well worth it to have a couple of hours of music in your pocket.The only downside is no FM tuner, and limited expandablilty. It works great for what I bought it for, working out in the gym. Who wants to work out for 3 or 4 hours? ;) Compose your own custom workout playlist and download it.It's a great gadget that makes my trips to the gym a lot more appealing."
5,Desiree Million,"I am fortunate to have the privilege of knowing Desiree personally. I not only have heard her first. But her second as well - and If you liked her first album -- You will LOVE her second, her voice is mature with ranges that will make the hairs on your neck tingle --- I highly recommend it."
5,Sings with so much feeling,"I wish I could hear Desiree Million sing more songs, her voice and soulful delivery makes you feel like you know her. A few dollars for the CD for one person sharing her feelings with the world is money well spent. Thank you Desiree for working hard to share yourself with the world. Desiree is a wildflower growing wild... :)"
3,Good,This is a 2 cd set and the chakra one is OK. It's kind of annoying because he talks througout it. I really like the vibrational cd better. He talks in this one too but only at the beginning. Then it's just sounds etc. I really do feel lighter when I'm done and I like the imagry he uses in the beginning. So if I could rate them separately I'd give the chakra one like a 2 and the vibration one a 4 (so I gave this an overall 3 - the average).
2,Didn't work for me,"I've tried the CDs a few times and have had no success with them at all. Don't take this rating too seriously though, because nothing of trance work or astral projection has been successful with me thus far."
1,Don't buy it,This product didn't do anything for me. Sort of gives the allusion that it's gonna work. My boobs got bigger the same way they do when you get your monthly. Wouln't recommend this product.
3,It's just ok,I like the way this product makes my breasts feel. They are very soft and supple now. Not much in the way of firming them up though..you must have to use it for a long time I am assuming. And since it is such a small jar you would need to purchase many to see a real difference
1,fake,it's a fake...i bought 4 months supply and no result at all..i also consumed caffein...don't waste your time and money
1,Waste of money,I bought this product and it didnt work at all! I bought it from the original company and when i called to get my money back... they wouldnt. I tried this garbage for 6 months ond it did nothing at all! Don't waste your money ladies!
2,Kind of a let down,"I'm one of those who will try random things to make my breasts bigger rather than go under the knife, so I ordered this product and haven't noticed any difference, which was to be expected. Not worth your money."
4,GREAT,This product works well for me. Don't be alarmed by all the negative reviews on it. I've been using cream for almost a month and my breast are firmer. I notice that they are sometimes tender and that lets me know its working. It doesn't leave a sticky feeling if you rub it in good enough. And I still have half the bottle so i'll continue to use and will definately buy more!!!! Try it out it won't hurt...it might just work for you like it does for me...and its cheap..you can't beat that!!
1,Do not Like,I have used enhancement products from Nature Day and have found much more to my liking. This product is very heavy. The product from Nature Day is very light and does not leave a sticky feel when it is applied. I will not order again.
2,i gained bigger boobs but so did my whole body!,i took this along w/it's pills they recommend- they were bigger but i noticed i was gaining weight everywhere else from those silly pills!!! so i stopped!
1,"Bogus, not worth it.",I tried this stuff for a few months and nothing happened. My breasts did not get any bigger. Don't buy.
1,I would NOT definitely recommend!!!,I am flat chested and had bought the 6 month pills and creams supply. Used it all and it did not work at all.
3,Too Soon..,"Too soon to tell for sure, only been using it for about a week in conjunction with Pueraria Mirifica. Definitely notice more fullness immediately following application of BA. Will update in a month or so."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"I used this product with Zoft Breast Gum, and received no results at all. I used for almost a month twice a day and sometimes three times a day. I followed all enlargement tips like limiting caffeine intake,taking multivitamin, exercising, etc. I know that you have to be patient, so maybe I just didn't wait long enough. With breast enlargement products you may have to keep searching until you find the one that works for you and this one just didn't work for me. This product may work better for others. I have started taking two other supplements and in just three days I feel them working."
4,Fascinating time capsule of the cinematic world,"Hundreds of film artists from around the world documented their day in this historic account of what, for most of the diarists, was an ordinary work-day.The most well-written entries are by the least well-known people - my favorite is by cult film director Jurgen Vsych (who recently published her brilliant memoir, ""The Woman Director""). Vsych's description of what it's like for a struggling young director to find financing for her feature debut is hilarious."
4,Works well for acne and general face & pore cleansing,"I use these to clean my face as I have very oily skin. Good deep cleaning product which is evidenced by the dark stains left on the pad after use. Sometimes if I take an early shower, before I go to bed I will use one of these to clean my face since I build up oil on my forehead quickly.Good product and oxy makes one of the best.Product does sting a bit since it has benzoyl peroxide but that is the active ingredient that fights acne and pimples. It also kills Bacteria in the pores."
4,Software scam raises price ...,"I like my Olympus. It fits my needs. It comes with CamediaMaster 4.0 software so you can download to your computer. You can make calendars and postcards. But guess what: It has no e-mail function! In fact, you can't even get your photos out of the program and into other folders to use in projects, or letters. But on the main screen is an icon for Pro-Camedia...which leads to the Camedia site online, where you can compare the specs for the two programs and see how Pro-C has e-mail....Why would someone want photos on their computer if they couldn't use them in e-mail? It's not a good enough camera for someone to do art stuff with and, say, high quality printing...of calendars......"
5,Excellent camera,"I've owned the camera for about seven months now and can find nothing to criticize. I initially bought it thinking I'd carry it with me everywhere, but it's a little too big to do that. I do carry it with me frequently, though. I love the image quality and simplicity. I have no issues with my 8x10 pictures. I'm just delighted with this camera."
1,Olympus d #80,This is my second d-380. The first one I purchased was returned for spots in the image. The second one has the same defect. I sent the product to Olympus for repair which wasnt done nor will they replace the camera so I'm stuck with it. It's a defect Olympus will not admit to. Their customer service is no service. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAMERA!!!!!
1,Not nearly as good as I expected,"For the price of this camera I was very disappointed. Lens cover is a bit flimsy, pitcure quality is lousy even at highest resolution. LCD display is slow to respond. Menu display could be more intuitive, flash over-compensates and washes out pictures entirely. No optical zoom, digital zoom is terrible, non-standard USB. Do your self a favor and spend a few more dollars and get a better digital camera. This one is a dissapointment. Ended up with a Sony Mavica which is more money but is a far better camera."
3,5 - Megapixels in your pocket,"If you need to put a high res camera in your pocket, this camera is the ultimate. All the controls are designed for one hand operation. The pictures it takes are incredible but it has a somewhat quirky focusing system. The camera spends a lot of time trying to find its focusing point and it's not always successful in low light, low contrast situations. Because of its small size it also lacks some of the features of its larger albeit more expensive cousins such as a TTL hotshoe, advanced noise filtering and a more robust super macro mode. In summary...a great camera for the price if you don't need the more professional features of the larger cameras."
2,Lousy instructions,"Seemingly good camera for the price. Once you start using it, you notice all the deficiencies. I also have a Sony 1.3 MP digital and this Olympus 2 MP is not any better definition than the Sony. The instructions, especially how to download the pictures into your PC are the worst I have seen. Hard to follow even for a degreed engineer like myself. Figure out why the SHQ mode at 1600x1208 pixels takes twice as much memory in the Smart Card as the HQ setting at 1600x1200 pixels. My suggestion: Spend a few more bucks and get a real camera. This one is for the birds."
5,Great little family camera,"We've had this camera for almost 2 years and have taken about 3 or 4 gig worth of family pictures. Really easy to use (even the kids use it), compact, relatively inexpensive, reliable, durable (we've dropped it a few times on our tile floor- just put the batteries back in and keep on truckin). I suggest getting a 128MB m=smart media card and eight Nickel Metal Hydride AA batteries (1700 Mah or more) with a charger. These accessories allow us to avoid changing the memory card at all (holds about 130 photos on the highest quality setting) and we change the batteries whenever needed (roughly about once every 150 to 200 photos?)"
4,Solid Camera for the $$,This is a great camera for beginners and those that do not have money to burn.
5,great camera,"This camera took really great pictures! I took it on vacation over the summer and we took pictures at all times of the day. I have an amazing night shot that turned out 100 times better than I thought it would. If you're looking for an affordable camera that takes great pictures, look no further."
3,Great camera-Poor software,"I just got this camera a couple of days ago. The picture quality is wonderful. The camera is easy to use, takes great pictures and has a ton of options that makes it fun to use.The problem is the software included for loading your pictures onto your computer. The Camedia Master software lets you load your pictures from your camera to this program but IT DOES NOT LET YOU SEND PICTURES THROUGH EMAIL OR EVEN TRANSFER THEM TO A DISK. I spent hours trying to do this, thinking I was just doing something wrong. In the end, I wasn't. You have to buy the upgrade to Cameia Master Pro in order to do this. I think this was pretty much false advertisement on Olympus's part..."
1,Achilles heal - weak battery compartment cover - renders camera useless,"Don't buy it. This was a good camera - loved it in fact - until I bumped it against a table as I turned to take a picture, and the battery compartment lid broke open. It wasn't a big bump either, a rather slight bump in fact, but must have hit the camera just right. The tiny plastic ridges that keep it closed snapped off, making it impossible to close, rendering the camera totally useless. If you can't close the battery compartment, you can't use the camera. I wrote Olympus twice over a year ago, but they never responded. Too bad, up until then I raved about Olympus. I since bought a Canon A620 and found it takes WAY better pics, has a ton more features, and has been very durable."
4,OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA,"I am giving this digital camera 4 stars. Its an excellent camera for 2 megapixels. The only thing that gets on my nerves is NO OPTICAL Zoom. Only digital zoom and that it uses the hard to find SMART MEDIA MEMORY CARD. Aside from this, for 2 megapixels, it takes excellent pictures. Most pictures I took came out excellent. Whatever pictures came out terrible were my own doing and not the camera. Does print clear pictures too. I would recommend this camera, except it only has digital zoom. Its the Optical zoom number you want to look for. But it may be fine for ebay usage. It wont matter much if you zoom in with the digital zoom for ebay. But I don't recommend using the digital zoom for important pictures such as of friends and family. Considering my dad has had this camera since either 2000 or 2001 and it still works, I recommend it, except please remember its the OPTICAL ZOOM number you want to look for."
3,"no optical zoom, but otherwise good","This was my first digital camera and it isn't a bad camera to start with. It is a bit big, and it doesn't have an optical zoom. However, I love the durability and it was a great first camera. What I especially liked about this camera was that when the screen broke (which I admit is my fault) I was still able to use it while I looked for a new one because it has a viewfinder. You'll definatly need to buy a new memory card after purchasing this camera, but I think that's pretty common among any camera you buy. It takes four AA batteries, so it is also almost necessary to buy recharable batteries. However, after I did that, I found it has a very long battary life. All in all, I liked this camera and was sorry to see I had broke it, but I'm ready for something smaller with an optical zoom."
2,Opening Mechanism Breaks,"I bought this camera in 1999 for $300+. It takes good pictures with a steady hand and some Zen magic--sharp, clear, and best of all, it can take macro pictures. There is a problem with blurring, however, as it is impossible to hold this camera still while you wait for the depressor to finish exposure. The sliding opening mechanism, which turns the camera on, flies open in your bag or pocket--there is nothing to hold it closed. This drains the battery. Worse yet, this mechanism broke, came loose, and the camera stopped working altogether. New batteries last for about 4 pictures, then you have to change them. I'd put your money into a better design with battery power and a better depressor."
1,Disappointed in TI,This product could not be loaded on my computer because it did not recognize the product key that was shipped with the software. I contacted TI-Cares which is an oxymoron. Talked to a non-caring service technician. Told to email the license agreement to TI. Never heard from TI. The only positive was the Amazon return response. It went smoothly and fairly quickly. No longer a TI fan. This was my first return experience with Amazon. They have their act together. This was new software.
3,"Cute, but doesnt last","I bought this house, because I think the brats dolls are so cute, and my daughter loves little doll houses, unfortunately, the furniture that comes in this thing [are]pretty [bad]. Ours only lasted a few days. It is like little pieces of cardboard that dont hold shape, and have to keep getting fixed. I think they could have made something hard plastic like. The blankets are cute though, and my daughter liked the little elevator inside of it. Everything about it is cute, but the furniture [is]really really [bad], which makes the whole thing, in my opinion, a waste..."
2,...,"For the amount of money being made on these Bratz toys, you would think they could at least give real furniture with this loft!! Beware--- the furniture is flimsy plastic that you simply bend into shape and is kept together with tabs. My girls waited and waited for this to come and after we opened it, bent the furniture together, and set it up, they put on their snowpants and went outside to play!!!"
2,A bit disappointed,"Sorry to say I was quite surprised at the quality of thisdoll house! Are hey kidding ? The furniture is the mostdisappointing thing! I understand why it is made out of the material it is made out of, for the removable stickers, BUTI would have paid more for a Bratzdoll house of BETTER quality. It explains why it costswhat it does. Next time I will not jump to just buy a new item!"
2,disappointed,I bought this for my grandaughters birthday. I was very disappointed in the furniture that came with it. It was horrible!!
1,A total piece of junk,I own everything ever put out by Bratz and I have to say this loft is a total piece of junk. If you don't believe me you can pretty much tell by the picture; the furniture is awful and the construction of the house is beyond poor. I would give this item ZERO STARS all around if it was possible. Don't waste your time or your money.
2,A box would be easier,"As the mother of a devoted Bratz fan, she's sure to get each and every piece that comes out for them. Including this cardboard box they call a toy. I must warn you, the first few days are the most frustrating as the furniture is made of cardboard and hard to manage plastic which you then drape fabric pieces over. My daughter was 9 at the time of receiving this item and after a week, it was closed up and used only for storing her Bratz dolls. I wouldn't recommend this unless you really only needed a storage case as the play value is very low."
2,Do you like your vacuum??,"If you want your vacuum to break then by all means get this toy. I have been doing nothing but picking up pieces that are everywhere. My daughter has everything Bratz and I have never picked up so many colorform pieces in my life. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. My daughter got this as a gift, so you can't even say ""well what did you expect for that price"". This is the worst to put all of the plastic, cardboard furniture pieces together and to keep bending them back into shape. Don't give it as a gift because it's more of a hassle for the person who has to put it together. Looks are deceiving on the front picture also, well unless you have alot of time to look at every detail and figure out that it is nothing but junk. Maybe it is enjoyable for older children, but if they are smaller, then I would not get this, unless you love to keep picking up all of these pieces and breaking your vacuum. If you want to get something cheap, than go for Barbie."
2,Cheap Quality,"My 6 year old daughter bought this toy and less than 2 months later it is already unless, except perhaps to function as a holder/carrying case for the Lil Bratz dolls. Please be aware before you purchase this set that the furniture is NOT sturdy. You must put the future together by folding small pieces of plastic paper. While it provides some ""fun"" in that you put the furniture together yourself be avised that most of the furniture is usless because the folds do not work well. The doll can not actually sit on the sofa, the tables do not stand evenly, etc etc. Save your money and buy one of the Lil Bratz sets that has actual furniture included, such as the High School or the Ski Set."
1,Lil' Bratz Mix N' Match Loungin' Loft,"Very cheaply made! We ended up throwing away the furniture right away, as it is made of a plastic cardboard. I would not recommend this to anyone. Pay more and get better quality, this is really cheap."
3,Don't waste your money,this is junk. i got this for cristmas and iwas very happy until i saw the pieces inside. i think this toy could have been more durable.
3,i dont have this but,"since i dont have this toy, and i no someone who did, i am going to tell ya about it.my frend wanted this toy, so ya, she went to the store to see it. only problem, is that she thought it was for big bratz.KNOW THIS: it is for lil bratz, not big ones (dont worry, she did not buy it)))"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This was a very dissappointing purchase. My daughter bought it with her birthday money and once she opened it I tried to talk her into taking it back to the store. What a waste of money! It is mostly cardboard and plastic. The furniture is plastic and you are to fold it into a bed, chairs, etc. The furniture does not even stand properly. Don't waste your money!"
1,What a waste!,"You could not go out of your way to waste more money than by buying this cardboard junk! I love the dolls so I just knew that the loft would be cool. Unfortunately, the furniture is a joke; it is flimsy and soft, useless plastic, and the stickers worthless. I wish I could return this to the store, but my daughter has already pushed it under her bed."
2,Save your money,"It was made cheaply, the pieces are hard to for a 9 year old to put together and they don't stay together. They are mostly made of cardboard."
1,Lil Bratz Loft Stinks!,"I bought this item from bratz a while back.I wanted it so bad,but when i got it,it was a piece of junk.One of the rooms wouldnt shut,the furnature wouldnt stay together,but I liked the stickers.I returned it the next day.Dont spend your hard-earnd money on this worthless item! :-)thanks"
5,Lovely and a good buy,"Very small, but beautifully made. it serves as a great keep sake and makes a lovely bereavement gift. i was very surprised how nice it was because the price was so reasonable. i bought two."
4,Very beautiful very well crafted.,I like it very much the whole presentation with the heart box just makes it very special. Veru secure ans safe to keep around the house.
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"There are not enough positive adjectives to describe UrnConcern. I took over 18 months to decide on an urn for my beloved Papillon, ""Bitsey"". When I had questions and contacted the company directly, I was treated with the upmost respect and compassion; the personal treatment I received made me feel like I was the only customer they had. I will use them in the future & Bitsey's in a beautiful place on our mantel."
4,Great urn,"I used this daily. I keep my brown sugar in it. So when people come over, they say ""Whoa dude who's in the urn!?"" and I say ""It's my Uncle Albert - he tastes pretty sweet!"" and I immediately open it and scoop out a spoonful of ""ashes"" and eat it! Immediately someone screeches or faints or pukes. It's loads of fun! Works on strangers, mailmen, ugly neighbors, just about anyone with a sense of humor, or lack thereof! Try it today! PS: Use brown sugar and not actual ashes."
5,No urn to good for my wife.,"The urn which I purchased for my wife's ashes is all I hoped it to be. It is a beautiful as I had anticipated and arrived quicker then I thought it would. The entire family was very pleased and when we put her ashes in the urn we fould out that there is plenty of room for my ashes when I might pass and then we will be together again and forever more. If I were to rate the suppling company, I would have to give them 5 stars.SincerelyMarvin Thompson and family."
4,Great Downtempo Blend,"You will be hard pressed to pigeon-hole this bands sound, which makes it all the more interesting. All the subtle organic and electronic touches give the melodic tunes an even greater depth. I review tons of tunes everyday and I have to be honest,this cd is well worth the money and has the staying power so many music cd's lack. It grows on you.....if you let it."
5,champagne cooler,"Similar to the wine cooler, just what we were looking for and needed for the larger bottles. reasonable price, fast shipping. thank you"
1,Waste of money,This thing doesn't chill or keep anything chilled. Whatever is in it never really freezes and becomes room-temperature in no time at all! A total waste of money!
1,"Cheap and badly conceived, poorly built","Find another machine if you're smart. This one is not a good deal. The switches don't work properly, the pretty metal trim popped loose on the second use, cups get hot on the outside and the coffee goes cold quickly. And, when you open up the top to put water in it, the condensation from the previous uses runs down the back of the machine and puddles on your counter. It has no automatic shut off, which makes it a potential fire hazard."
5,WHAT DO THEY EAT.,"AS BIRD SEED IS GETTING VERY EXPENSIVE, THIS BOOK WILL GIVE MY HUSBAND MORE IDEAS ON HOW TO FEED THE BIRDS ON A ""SENIOR"" INCOME."
5,Full of information,This book has answered so many questions for me. Reading this book is like talking with a friend who knows everything about birds and wants me to know it all too! The way it is set up alphabetically makes for an easy search and the pictures and diagrams are excellent. I will now have a more organized yard and happier birds.
5,Excellent book.,"This is a great book! Has all kinds of neat information and ideas. I have several books of this type and this one is by far my favorite. Well worth the money, you will use it again and again."
3,Great Book cheaply made,"The information contained in the book is great, one of the best bird books I own. To bad the publisher went the cheap way and produced a book using the hot glue binding process as opposed to a stitched binding. My copy has fallen apart!"
2,Album Wanders More Than A Blues Musician,"Having prepared myself for the masterful work of Corey Harris I must say this album came as a big disappointment. The songs wander through different genres with no feeling or purpose. Couple this with the engingeering, such that the volumes shift up & down from song to song and the result is a frustrating experience. Not really sure what Corey's intentions are, but after listening to the fake Jamaican accent on ""Sista Rose"", well....I pulled the CD out and resolved to sell it on eBay."
3,"I want ""All by Myself"" as album version...","This CD has most hit songs. However, if you prefer album version(7 min. long) of the ""All by Myself"", don't buy this. You will probably get the version only from ""Eric Carmen"" album. I love the piano solo part of the song."
1,I hate it,Most recipes are extremely fattening and those that I tried are especially heavy. Not at all to my liking. I will not recommend this product.
5,The Best DVD bar none on Pilot UFO Sightings!,"This is one of the freshest topics I have seen in many years on hte whole UFO topic. It takes a fresh approach to the UFO matter by exploring commercial pilots that have seen UFOs! It is narrated and presented by Dr. Richard F. Haines-NASA Research Scientist and features pilots Captain Neil Daniels-United Airlines,& Capt. Phil Shultz-Trans World Airlines.This is some of the most convincing UFO evidence I have yet seen that UFOs are REAL and need to be taken way more seriously!"
1,Piece of Junk,I recieved this DVD with no box just the DVD in a plastic slip cover and taped to a piece of cardboard inside the shipping box.Then when I tried to play it...it repeatedly froze up.What idiot shipped this DVD to me in this manner?Amazon is refunding my money. But save yours and stay away from this DVD!
3,a sad ending to a great poet,"I thought long and hard about what to say about this final collection of Ginsberg's. As a poet, he was one of the best, and it is out of sentiment and respect that made me want to like his final poems. But in reality, they do not stand up to his former work. I almost find it hard to believe that this is the same man who wrote Howl, Kaddish, and others. It was interesting to see what Ginsberg's state of mind was at the end. It would appear that it was mostly scatological thoughts and political ravings. Not that I mind those types of poems, if they are well written. But still, it is a collection that I would recommend for your personal library, if only because it is Ginsberg's last. Though there were some good poems and interesting thoughts in this collection. We will miss Ginsberg."
4,Nice little light but not sturdy,Leave it put if it falls it breaks easily it has happened before but nice light and design for the money.
3,"Too many, not enough","I've used this book many times in my visits to Red Lodge. While it claims to cover the ""best"" hikes, it really covers them all. The details of driving directions, etc. are right on. But on our last visit, last week, the hikes we picked out of the book were marginal and hard to find and follow. For us as dedicated Beartooth hikers, this book is a great resource. But it needs more comparison and more opinion. What's good about Hike #4 compared with Hike #5?"
4,Cool game,I gave this game to my 5 year old for Christmas - he loves it! His 13 year old brother likes it too. The grahics are pretty good - look just like the tv show. Its hard to beat at the CD Jewel case price!
3,First and possibly last good JN game,the game was fun but very short. My mom got it for me back when i was 8-ish and i loved it. I just re-bought it and i still love it.Quality 1/5Length 0/5Addiction 4/5Gameplay 4/5Overall 4/5
2,Full of Errors,"This book is full of technical errors. I really had to verify the charts that were in the book. One example in the book is where the authors mention megahertz(MHz). They claim that the unit Hertz (Hz) was named after ROBERT HERTZ. As a matter of fact the unit Hz was named after HEINRICH HERTZ, not Robert. Do the authors think that we are fools? This note to Tittel and Johnson, get a clue or don't publish it. Inspite of the technical errors, this book is informative and helpful"
1,Broke on first use,"For me, one of the pins at the end of the cable broke the first time I tried to plug it in a jack. The pins are extremely fragile, so I don't think I would recommend this cable for longevity."
3,Perky O's Apple Cinnamon Cereal,"I was a little disappointed in this cereal. The apple cinnamon flavor is not very pronounced, and the consistency once it has milk on it is a bit gummy. I may try it dry mixed with trail mix, but I probably won't buy it again once it's gone."
2,Disappointed,The writing style of this author is rather tedious. I love reading about movie stars and their lives but find myself skimming over paragraphs. I read an autobiography of Betty White in one night but this book is taking forever to get through and I love Ava Gardner and her movies.
5,"""A half F-word fox in a forest fire""","That was how former husband Mickey Rooney described Ava Gardner, a person of enormous appetites that she seldom denied herself. Lee Server is a fine biographer but a bio can only be as interesting as the subject...now here was a fascinating subject. Plucked from obscurity in one of those old Hollywood stories, a Talent Scout in NY, sees a picture of North Carolina native Ava Gardner and in a wink she has a MGM contract and men circling her 24 hours a day. Almost everyone in this book describes how truly stunning a creature she was. A reluctant actress, she was the premier 50's Sex Goddess and all you have to do is see her in one of her many films, to realize that she earned that title easily. Married, divorced, married...didn't matter to her, Ava may have stated that, ""love was nothing"", but it didn't stop her from seeking it out. Good summer read."
4,"very tasteful, well written biography","This book is very smoothly written. Its a page turner. It present her in a honest, tasteful persepctive. I've read severa novels about old Hollywood era stars and this was one of the more kinder ones that I've come across."
2,This was long and boring!,I finally got finished with this book. It is very long and some parts of the book are very boring.This account of her life makes her out to be someone who have few morals and a drinking problem. I found it to be very dull.
1,"Great writer, vapid subject","Lee Server's biography of Robert Mitchum was a brilliant page-turning narrative of a fascinating, unique, and enigmatic movie icon. This book on Ava Gardner, however, is a disappointment, a poor choice of subject, and an ultimately tiresome account of a woman who had all the breaks and all the luck in the world and did nothing with them. It's a tiresome chronicle of her drinking and sexual excesses from which the reader learns little about life. It's really a sad, depressing portrait of a vapid actress who lived off her iconic beauty like a parasite."
5,FABULOUS,WHEN I WAS DONE ON THE LAST PAGE I WANTED TO RE-READ IT. ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.
3,Pretty good biography,"Ava Gardner has been my favorite screen legend since first setting eyes on her in the movie Showboat on tv when i was twelve. and even though the movie had been made many years before, her beauty was so incredible and so classic i thought and still do think she was the most beautiful woman i had ever seen. i already knew about her life quite a bit because i am also a big Sinatra fan so the book didn't really reveal much new information to me and i was hoping for a larger photo collection in the book but overall if you are a fan or you just love biography's of very very interesting famous people this is absolutely one of the better ones you can read, a bit tedious in places i thought but a very good book. Thank You Mr. Server"
4,Dazzling,a very comprehensive and sensitive look at one of the most atractive actresses of the silver screen.
5,A great read.....,This biography of Ava Gardners life was entertaining yet sad at the same time. Alcohol really destroyed her life. It was sad in the fact that she was lonely and she never got to have the thing she wanted most which was a loving marriage (the one like her parents had) and kids.If she had not been an alcoholic her life wouldn't have had so much drama.She had a very interesting life and she was very beautiful. I had tears in my eyes at the end.
4,Enthralling Beauty,Lee Server's biography of Ave Gardner is deep with insightful perceptionsof her character and relationships as they were molded and unfolded. Themost interesting part of this engrossing bio covers the period between her marraige to Mickey Rooney and her establishment as an expatriate inSpain. You can sense Ava losing her naivity and replacing it with caution; but without compromising her sheer joy in living for the moment.Server captures her self-centeredness but also her smarts in a style equalto the panache of the subject herself.
4,A Wasted Life ~ more or less,"I loved this book and the author is a great writer. And he has a great subject, the beautiful and sensual Ava Gardner. My problem is that when you learn about Gardner's life much of the mystery falls away. She was certainly sexually insatiable and was ready to jump into bed with just about every man she came across. Is this fact supposed to endear her to us? Her marriage to Sinatra (her third after Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw) seems to have been one long drunken brawl. Again, where's the nobility in that. The lady liked gin and drank it constantly if you believe the book. Her epitaph, ""love is nothing"" is not exactly something that inspires. For true fans only."
5,Classic I will read many more times,Wow what a good job Lee did on this one. He really went out his way to make a touching book about Ava. Ava had the life Ave travled the world got to shag lots sexy men. Ava knew how to party she wasn't spending her life in her room watching the episodes of the golden girls like someone I knew. In some ways you have to pat Ava on the back she got her cherry poped by Andy Ronney how horrible that must be for the girl. Hes ugly and small. Av went on to better things such as Frank Sintra. At least he was a real man. Frank's love for Ava pushed him over the edge he even tried to end his life over this lady. Its a juicey book from stard to finsh. Ava Gardner fans you won't get bored form reading this book. Honest. I have read this book 2 times and will read it again and again!! Peace Out!!!
1,Ava - What a life,"This book was TERRIBLE. I'm glad I got it from the library and didn't pay for it. The author writes about her sex life for about 2/3 of the book. The beginning really gives us no inkling about the fact that she apparently was just collecting money in Hollywood and the ending makes it seem as if she ""just stopped in"" to London, although she lived there for 20 years. Her London flat was filled with valuable items, yet we get no inkling of her likes or dislikes (except for sex). She knew she couldn't act - why doesn't the author recognize that he can't write?"
4,Enjoyable read,"This was a nice, enjoyable read for me. Yes, sometimes I wanted to smack Alex upside the head and the random placing of commas throughout the book was a little distracting, but was it enough to completely ruin the book for me? Nah. This was a good read and I'm looking forward to more books by Carol Davis Luce."
5,tweety,"This is the first of Carol's books i have read.Loved,love, loved it. It kept me interested and enthralled fromThe beginning to the end.I am going to purchase the rest of her books immediately."
3,A Little Dated,"I believe this book was first published in 1990, and at times, it's age shows. As a story, it's not a bad premise, but for me, something just fell flat with the main characters, especially Alex. I found it really hard to like her or understand why she acted the way she did at times. And the romance was just awkward. It never really came together or made much sense. I suppose for a couple of bucks it's an OK read. But ***spoiler alert*** I can REALLY do without the animal torture that was present in this book."
2,"Rather Dull, Frequent Distractions","Sadly, ""Night Stalker"" turned out to be a rather dull, run-of-the-mill, ""suspense"" story, with an equally dull and run-of-the-mill cast of characters, whose one favorable attribute was unpredictable nature of the antagonist's. One reviewer commented on the frequency of their use of the page forward button...while I found myself doing the same thing, it was not due to any feeling of suspense on my part; rather, it was to get passed the all-too-frequent (and lengthy) sex scenes. Not that I was offended by these, nor am I trying to sound moralistic; they were simply distracting, adding nothing to the storyline (other than to further an already waning level of believeability). To me, the pervasiveness of lengthy and frequent sex scenes in any genre of fiction(other than romance or erotioca, I suppose) is just filler, used mainly to compensate for a lack of imagination on the author's part. It adds nothing to the story other than pages."
2,NIGHT STALKER,"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I HAD READ ANOTHER OF CAROL DAVIS LUCE'S BOOKS AND IT WAS GREAT BUT THIS ONE WAS AWFUL, I COULD NOT FINISH IT. WHAT A WASTE FOR SOMEBODY WHO OTHERWISE HAS WRITING TALENT. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE WROTE THIS BOOK. YUK."
2,as generic as the title,"Night Stalker is just one of the zillion books revolving around a woman being harassed and attacked by a mysterious stranger. However, the victim is maddeningly passive and complacent about her own safety, to the point where you find yourself thinking ""Check the locks on your doors!"" ""Call the police!"" or ""Carry a can of mace or a stun gun!"" The identity of the stalker is interesting, but his actions and goals leave more questions than they answer."
5,Heart-shattering romantic suspense-Don't miss this one!,"What is it like to be harassed and stalked, in your own house?In Carol Davis Luce's atmospheric, landmark suspense novel-precursor to the best of the romantic suspense genre-Alex Carlson has moved into her father's house to regroup from past problems and regenenerate her art career. The house is just what she needs; beautiful and secluded. But someone doesn't want her there. And that someone is playing for keeps.Soon Alex is brought face to face with the horrific lessons of her childhood, and the origination of the menace is much closer than she thinks.NIGHT STALKER kept me up until three in the morning. The writing just grabbed me and kept me turning pages, even though at some points I have to admit to being creeped out. This is the kind of book where you want all the lights in the house on, and try not to listen to the branch outside, scraping at the window..."
2,frustrating,"I completely agree with David Group. I can't stand it when the victim is too stupid to see what is happening to them. SPOILER-- She had no clue that it could have something to do with her family history, even when the very first warning contained a key phrase from her haunted childhood !! REALLY? Then she continues on--REPEATEDLY-- putting herself in danger by insisting on going back to her home-- where she was attacked --ALONE-- without a weapon of any kind! The story was fine, but I get distracted by the fact that the main character might be a moron."
2,defective,"It took great pictures but needed to be returned....Both the original and the new replacement cameras were defective. (The button would ""stick"" and not let you take photos sometimes.)"
1,Olympus Cameras defective,"I have purchased two of the ""clam shell"" Olympus cameras...they both broke within 2 years. The clam shell lens cover fails to operate and the camera will not function. Don't waste your money on this camera!"
1,Broke on the 3rd roll of film,"Be careful....on the third roll of film I tried to load, the camera refused to load. Tried multiple rolls of film, new battery, etc, to no avail. Had to send it back."
2,disappointed !!!!,"Hello there, I was pleased with the packing and mailing of the camera. Although it said slightly mused,it was first time I ever took a chance.So far the camera had dark developed pictures. there was a delay in flash going off. My other Olympous did not have that delay. I figure that is why pictures developed cloudy. Point and shoot. It did not come with a guide of how to use it. I read somewhere in the process of ordering said it was part Digital....???? but did not know how to verfy and use it.Would like the camera store to get in touch with me. thank you, SharonR."
3,"Well Spun Tales of True Crime and Justice, Few Surprises","Steve Jackson's clean, crisp prose and his story-telling ability make ""No Stone Unturned"" a very readable and enjoyable journey into the fascinating world of forensics. Despite a diverse cast of characters and five detailed case studies, I couldn't help but be disappointed. My chagrin is not related to the writing, but is due to the fact that in each of the cases it was the traditional detective work that lead the forensic team to within yards of the bodies they were searching for. The team was only called to complete the process. I expected that their abilities would be showcased in locating the impossible, but they proved far more human then dust jacket promised."
3,mah...,this is a decent read for someone who is older in my opinion...in older i mean older than 21. talks about some old cases.
3,Dilettantes.,"Not a keeper. I mean, it's well written and interesting, but the information about NecroSearch is a distracting digression that imposes itself upon otherwise interesting murders. You're reminded at the end of each story that NecroSearch helped, too. I thought of the Shake-N-Bake commercial where the kids squeal ""and I helped!"" Dilettantes. This jewel is going in the yard sale box."
4,Outstanding!,Our two year old son LOVES Franklin and this was the perfect video for our flight to Maui.
1,Terrible,"NEVER GET THIS DVD FOR YOUR CHILD! MINE HATED IT!!!!!! THE DVD BROKE IN HALF IN THE MACHINE!!!!!!! THE BOTTOM WAS ALL SCRATCHED!!! (BY THE WAY,THE REASON MY NAME IS FRANLOON IS BECAUSE MY CHILD PUT IT LIKE THAT!!!!)"
1,"1 microscopic dot, not 1 star","The game simply does not work. We tried loading it on all five home computers (two desktops & three laptops), none worked. Amazon was good about replacing it, but the new copy would not play either. I took it to the office to have our computer geek load it and he could not make it work. Take your chance if you wish, but you've been warned."
1,Software doesn't work,I was not able to install this game on either of 2 computers running XP.On the companies tech support page there is a patch to download but my children's computer is not connected to the internet and when I tried to download to my computer it would not run.
4,Great for 3d newcomers,"Just learning 3d Studio Max? Michele's book is for you! Easy to read, thorough, a great foundation for understanding a quite complex program."
2,Not worth its prize ...,If you are all but a total novice and have been even superficially introduced to 3DMAX ( no matter which relase ) this book is not for you. It is obvious even at the first glimpse at the book that it's not going to bring on any novelty to the non-beginner ... And the inadequacy of its description ( both on the back cover and online ) is just a scandal. As an advanced user I was attracted by the internet reviews but I have to say that after having read the book I found it of a really poor quality and the only part that was new to me was just a couple of pages on f/x. I would never recommend this book to anyone including the beginners for whom I'd find better books to start with. DON'T BUY IT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY MISTAKE !!!
5,well-written book on the illogic that has entered science,"Mainly due to naturalists, illogic has entered science and society. Sproul clearly shows the fallacies behind the ""chance"" of naturalists. Full of examples and quotes (not sure what the detractor below was reading), this book easily shows and teaches the fallacies prevading our culture. Similar books are Geisler's ""Come Let us Reason"" and Phillip Johnson's ""Reason in the Balance."""
2,Sproul should quit doing philosophy,"R.C. sproul presents a well reasoned argument in Not a Chance but fails to consider the contempary philosophical debate in appropriate detail. He's right chance dosn't cause, but couldn't there just not be cause? This work is very similar to his others on free will, good but lacking in the philosophical muscle which he attempts to emulate. This book should have been better researched and risen to the level of the debate instead of dragging the debate through old stuff."
5,Thumbs up,"I bought this for my husband as a gift, so I am sure he will enjoy it because he requested it himself!"
3,A Bit Redundant,"Chance does not act as a causal power, or else it is a contradiction, which is impossible. That's pretty much the book. He has some good points, though. It is a meaningless to speak of uncaused events, so something is wrong with people who say such things.I wish he would have spent more time considering if the universe (a multiverse?) was even caused at all. Or, he could have explored the concept of an infinite regress. He could have tried to show how that is contradictory via Hilbert's Hotel or maybe by a new idea. For those two ignored questions, the book only gets three stars."
1,Did not work on PC or Mac,"I had purchased this program along with Hoyle Card Games 2008. It was very unstable on my PC running with XP. It did not work on the mac. tried it on another pc running windows 98 also proved very unstable. Hoyle Card Games is a much, much better product."
4,Get the vol 1 with DVD MUCH BETTER!,"I bought the Vol 1 book with the 14 hour DVD. It's a great book, but teaches very little theory. The 14 hour DVD is a guitar teacher basically showing you how to play all the lessons and exercises. Plus the duets are broken up, so you can play the DVD and practice with him playing 1 part of the duet.If you're looking for lessons in guitar theory, www.absolutelyunderstandguitar.com is a FANTASTIC course."
1,Changed formula . . . YIKES!,"I have been using this product for years, but J&J has recently changed the formula. They didn't even have the decency to note the change on the bottle itself. I immediately noticed the difference though. The light, pleasant odor was replaced by a sunscreen-like smell. The lotion also felt heavier. But the worse is yet to be told. After one application, I broke out in a rash all over my face!!! I once adored this product, and it has now betrayed me. Please contact your doctor before using it . . . especially if you have sensitive skin, which is why I began using it in the first place. Also, please note that all of the ""good reviews"" on this website are dated 2005, 2006, 2007, etc. Check out the ones dated 2010 to the present AFTER the company changed the product."
1,changed formula!,"J&J recently changed the formula for Purpose. I've been using it forever, will have to change. The very light, pleasant odor is gone - replaced with a sunscreen smell. And there is a slight burning sensation when you apply it. They've really screwed up the product with this change."
5,Awesome,"This is an absolutely beautiful CD. I love every song especially ""the lifter"" and ""the presence."" If anyone is in a choir or praise team or if you just enjoy's gospel music, you should pick up this CD!!!!!"
3,Ouch.....,"When I first started to use this product i had pretty mild acne. after about 5 days of using it i noticed that there were red blotches beneath my eyes that were Very noticable, so i tried stopping using the cleanser and it went away... otherwise, it worked really well on the blemishes and zits that i had.... so if you have delicate skin Do Not use it under your eyes!"
1,Painful,"I am a fifteen year old and I have used this product for years and it always burns my skin! Maybe my skin is just too sensitive, but I've always had problems with drying/peeling to the extent where patches of my skin will be paler in the summers because of the peeling. It does not help acne as much as it probably should. I have finally convinced my mom to switch brands... If you insist on using Neutrogena, opt for the acne lotions and use the spot treatment method."
1,Avoid it!,"This product is horrible! I couldn't even use it for a week. Maybe I have very sensitive skin, but this product tore my skin up. The first day was alright. It left my skin feeling kind of tight afterwards, stripping my skin of all oil. The second day, my skin was red after using it. I just figured that it was working. Then I noticed my skin really drying out. By the third day, I noticed hundreds of little whiteheads on my skin, covering my entire face. They were really tiny, and you could barely notice them, but with bright light, you could see them. The texture of my skin really began to deteriorate. My skin was very dry, regardless of using moisturizer. My friends even remarked about the redness of my face. I stopped using it right away. It took a week at least for my skin to recover from using the product. My skin eventually peeled and now it's finally better. I went straight back to cetaphil, thank God. AVOID this product!!! Especially if you have sensitive skin like me!"
4,Neutrogena is a pretty good product. It didn't ...,Neutrogena is a pretty good product. It didn't irritate my skin or make my skin dry while using it. I'm in my mid 20's and I get some acne occasionally.
4,I've used Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash for a ...,"I've used Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash for a couple of weeks. First, I could say I like it very much. Before testing this, I used many brands, but didn't like them much. The good thing about the Neutrogena Acne Wash is that after I finish washing my face, I feel clean and best of all I don't feel like I'm losing too much moisture from my face. The same product of other brands make my face feel tight and dry, but not this one. I would recommend everyone with an oily face to try this product and you'll find a difference as I found. It would be a lot better if they would put this product in a small tube so I could carry it in my personal bag."
1,HORRIBLE!!!! Causes your face to burn!,"I am so disappointed. I bought this product from Walgreens just the other day and was excited to try it. I really really really regret buying it now. My face is completely burned. It looks and feels like I have the worst sunburn ever. It's so sore and my lips are dry/sore. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! Maybe it's just my skin, but by reading other reviews it's happened to other people too. I've discontinued using it and I've e-mailed Neutrogena to express how disappointed I am. I have never been in this much pain before, it's the worst feeling. Don't buy!"
2,Acne? No. Oily Skin maybe.,"Okay, if you have acne, this product probably won't help very much.HOWEVER...If you have very very light cases of acne (meaning you hardly ever get breakouts, but if you do, they're never red or inflamed and are only visible under bright light) This'll make your skin smooth in a jiffy.My acne is more severe than that, mostly due to my incessant picking (doesn't everyone??? o_O) and so this product doesn't help. I still use it though, but only once a week or less. For some reason, I found that if I used it too often, it lost its potency. Perhaps it's TOO gentle of a cleanser...Anyhow, I would not recommend this as a cure for acne at all, but as a nice acne prevention and soft wash for those of you with healthy skin."
3,Good for the Long Haul,"Stuck at the airport waiting for your flight? Riding in the car with nothing but miles of empty road ahead of you? This book will help pass the time away. A good light read. It doesn't delve too deep into historical fact to making you think, and Ms. Bradshaw still hasn't quite gotten the knack of writing a decent love story, but the book does move at a good pace and keeps you interested to the end."
4,Well researched and engaging historical with a bit of romance,"This is a very well written book with a gutsy and strong heroine who wants to become a physician in ancient Rome. There is a pleasant side romance as well. After reading the book, I found myself looking up maps of Ancient Rome to plot the heroines travels from Ephesus to Alexandria. It really sparked my interest in early Christianity, the Council of Niccae, the Goths, etc. It is history with a great romance attached. It would be appropriate for Young Adults as well, especially teen girls who want a well researched story of female empowerment."
5,Beacon at Alexandria,I first read this book in 1988 when I was 11 years old. At that time I thought it was the best book I had ever read.It is a fantastic story with lots of good historical detail.Whilst an enjoyable read for all age groups I suspect it may be more suitable for older children and teenagers than adults.I eventually lost my copy of this book and as it went out of print I had to borrow a copy from my local library pretend to lose it and pay the resulting fine.I recently rediscovered the book at my father's house and am planning to reread it soon.What amazes me is that reading through the reviews some one else had exactly the same experience as me and also resorted to this tatic with the library.Glad to see it back in print.
1,I was happy until...,"To make a long story short, I was happy until I had to reinstall musicmatch. The program is fairly feature filled, and has some convenient ways to organize a music collection.However, I originally had purchased the product so that I could use it with my Rio 500 portable player. Unfortunately, they pulled support for the Rio, and removed all the Rio 500 downloads from their site. I pleaded with tech support to e-mail me the drivers, but they refused (this was only a few days after the driver was pulled). I even offered to downgrade to a previous version, if that was the problem. All they said was no, you are out of luck.So my advice is this - don't buy musicmatch, go with something else. They do not stand behind their product."
4,Pretty Good Product,"I had no problems installing Jukebox 7 on a Win98SE box and performance was satisfactory. For creating MP3s of jazz and rock, Jukebox works fine and is trouble free. The only quibble I had was that there is no obvious way to generate a single MP3 file from multiple tracks (necessary when making MP3s of long classical pieces). To MusicMatch's credit, they promptly responded to my E-mail and gave me a work-around. The method is clumsy compared to my old CD Creator 4 which I eventually went back to using."
1,don't get it!!! trust me...and read this,"note: if i could give it negative stars i would have given a -5!When i got it i thought it would be awesome. I realised the problem right away...When you add tracks to your music library, the tracks are put into alphabetical order. I HATE this. There is no way around it. FOr example: the cd tommy by ""the who"" has to be played in a certain order for you to understand the story (it's a rock opera if you dind't know) in alphabetical order, it's all messed up. Musicmatch also looks ugly, and is very clunky. I am not a mac person, but i would say that itunes is FAR superior to musicmatch. save yourself the money and download itunes for free. It is SOOOOOOO much better. You'll agree with me if you see both. (trust me)"
4,Definitely not Timberlake!,"I must say I am amused by the reviews comparing Thomas to Timberlake here. Oh, the gall! Anyone who has spent some time listening to both voices must agree that Thomas has much better control, better phrasing, wider range, more power and possesses a voice that integrates well with whatever melody is behind him than Timberlake's. Try removing the vocals and play the voice and music separately for each singer and you'll see what I mean. Please spare me with the comparison. Timberlake is a good singer in his own right, but he needs backing and does very well in a group. Solo? I am not so sure. When I see Santana signing up Timberlake on a megaplatinum album is when I'll eat my shorts! :)"
3,Solo Matchbox,"It really surprises me when a artist goes solo at times. Nevertheless, it does happen quite a lot. For Rob Thomas from Matchbox Twenty fame, he has done quite well as a solo man before with the success of Smooth with Santana, and a remarkable songwriter, but his solo status is quite fair. His latest single, Lonely No More, his debut single as a solo act fairs quite well, with a driven beat. The song is alright, but not anything over the top to master. Still, it does surpass a lot of manufactured acts out there right now. I think it is a good single, and is worth a good listen to.Song: C+"
5,Best effort yet!,"The Mudhens have produced another great CD. Combining the 5 excellent songs from ""Vinyl"" with 6 fantastic new songs, the Mudhens have taken a great EP and made an incredible full length album for fans new and old to listen to. They certainly proved during their CD release party that they can pack a venue of 600+ people and have them all singing along in no time. A wonderful new effort from the Mudhens and producer Anthony J. Resta. This album is must have for anyone. ..."
5,America's Greatest Untapped Resource,"BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW! Trust me. You will not be disappointed.You probably have never heard of the Mudhens, which is a crying shame? Now is your shot at redemption.""Save Yourself"" is my favorite song off of Solo Projects. It's just a song that has a great flow from start to finish. Nice driving percussion, smooth bass, funky keyboards : gotta love it. My least favorite would have to go to ""Something"". I heard the original version of this song about a year ago, much better tempo. This new version just seems like more of a dirge. Lead singer Emily Fontano just seems miserable having to drag out the vocals. This girl needs to rock out! Emily needs a little more up-tempo beat, which can be heard on ""Getting By"", ""Hope"", and especially on ""Real"", where her emotion comes across so naturally. She seems to have a real energy that you wish you could bottle. Overall, a great, great disc. A definite must have!"
3,Purchased this book for a class,"I would never recommend this book for the ""enjoyment of reading."" It is strictly a college level text and not fun."
2,Svideo Cable,"I really don't get it? Why would a company make a 36"" long AV cable to patch together two pieces of AV gear which are usually located indoors with a cable that has a 1/2""+ stiff exterior jacket and cable ends (plugs) that could be used for trailer connectors? They were so big, stiff and heavy I feared they were going to crack or damage the PCB which the equipment jacks were soldered. I bought (3) of them, they were $3.99 each, I just threw them in the garbage. Don't misunderstand, these looked and were packaged like they would be on a rack at a local Hi-Fi shop for $50 each. I know the difference between quality cables, which these probably were, but they were so overkill they were unusable."
3,Hardy Boys Walk on Wild Side,"An entertaining Hardy Boy book for one simple reason: they finally shed the goody-goody image. Taking the case of Bob Conway, a ne'er-do-well biker accused of hijacking, against their father's commands, the Hardys soon find themselves on the wrong side of the law, because Comway had recently escaped from jail. In this casefile, the brothers find themselves up against a ruthless motorcycle gang and a desperate bounty hunter. The Hardy's attempt to clear a man's name is a good lesson in friendship. Even though every one seemed to be against Conway, the Hardy Boys stood up for him. The book did, however, miss some opportunities for more exciting action. The mere fact that the Hardys were on the wrong side of the law makes this a must-read."
3,very comfortable safety boot,I recommend these boots to anyone who has large feet and so far been unhappy with the range of safety footwear on the market . I will definitely buy again and will tell others with awkward foot size to try these Nautilus boots.
4,Happy feet,"I ordered these because they were a fair price and had been well reviewed elsewhere. NZ is too expensive for the equivalent grade of work shoe. These shoes are really comfy, flexible, provide good grip and look good too. I am a carpenter/builder and have used these both inside and out - even on roofs. Would recommend to other builders."
2,Look for something else!!,I am a 250lb man and I had never tried this brand of shoes but plain and simple....I have had better and more comfortable shoes from Target or Walmart!!I would not consider buying this brand again!
2,not the color of the shoe,I like to choose the color that you be careful not grip as you choose the color of shoes you no thanks
4,The Real Truth,"Hiya,I've had a pair of these for over a year and a half and rotate them out with the slip on types with the same tread. Minimal breakin and very comfortable thereafter. Just today the seam outboard of the forward lace area split open (at the sole)I cut the other shoe to match and will wear these until the new pair shows up.Bear in mind I've been wearing these shoes 13 hours a day/7 days a week in both Iraq and Afghanistan and they've been great. I also ordered a cheaper pair also by Nautilus and for some reason received a $35.00 promotional credit. Having said that I'm out the door with 2 pairs of safety shoes for $105.00 which is 8 dollars more than I paid for the pair that failed today, purchased a year and a half ago... Go figure :0)RegardsMike T"
3,Consideraciones del zapato,"hola atodos el zapato es bueno pero internamente deberia ser mas resistente , les digo ke es muy codo y ergonomico y sirve para el trabajo fuerte, trabajo en una petrolera y he tenido contacto con muchos tipos de fluidos asi como tambien manejo equipos electrizados y hasta ahora todo bien , pero insiste ke deberia ser mas fuerte en la tela interna"
3,Not as great as you think it is...,"Although I do like Olympus products I haven't been too impressed by the D520 model. It does take great pictures during the day, but at night is a different story, every image ends up blurred, no matter how you change the settings or how still you hold it. Its TERRIBLE for concert pictures! I'm also disappointed with it's mpeg feature, friends of mine have dig cams with up to a minute of video AND sound, while this camera only has 15 seconds, no zoom and no sound, and they paid much less for their cameras. The D520 also has an annoying tendency to pause before taking the picture, making candid shots impossible to take. The camera itself is nice looking and does have some good effects, all in all, I would recommend buying it used, as the new price is not worth it."
2,Nice Camera BUT Be Aware!,"The Olympus D-520 is a nice camera. Easy to use, nice zoom, sharp photos and the Camedia Master 4.0 software (included) for editing is good and also easy to use. It would be a fine digital camera for a first time buyer. And, very good if you want to take photos and just print them.HOWEVER - You must upgrade to Camedia Pro 4.0 PRO software (online for twenty bucks)to be able to email a photo and there is no way around it. Even with the PRO software you will not be able to email photos if AOL or CompuServe is your ISP. You also must use the upgrade if you want to use ANY OTHER photo editing program. So, please be aware of this, I wasn't."
3,A little disappointing,This was an upgrade from my previous Olympus 1.3 megapixil camera which was quite satisfactory. Problems with this camera center primarily around focus. Much difficulty focusing in even mildly low light and many photos are still out of focus. Also there is quite a long period of downloading before the next picture can be taken. The accompanying manual is rather brief and inadequate.
1,"Fragile camera, maybe not for teenagers","I carefully researched digital cameras before deciding on this one. It had all the features I wanted, and the price was right.Unfortunately, the manufacturers don't tell you how easily these cameras break!Within the first six weeks, my teenager accidentally dropped it from a height of about two feet, and the zoom lens zammed, making the camera inoperable. It's not covered under the limited warranty, and the repair estimate from Olympus ranges between ...[alot of money of alot more money]!It's one thing to have a lot of great features, but for many people a digital camera is used by the whole family, and this one may not be tough enough for the job."
3,Too slow,"I had the Olympus D-450 before and I loved it. Now I wanted a 2 Megapixel camera and decided to buy the Olympus D-520. In general it's a great camera - lightweight, great picture quality, easy to use - but what I REALLY did not like (and that's the reason I returned this camera): It takes way too long in between shots. If you use the flash and your batteries are not brandnew (the camera shows them as full) you have to wait approx. 30 seconds, maybe even more until you can make your next shot. Believe me - kids don't hold still that long! I think they sacrificed the speed by using only 2 batteries. Now I will go on the quest to find a faster camera."
2,WARNING! CAN YOU DOWNLOAD YOUR PHOTOS?,"The camera works great, but what Olympus neglect to tell you, until you search through the fine print in the manual buried inside the packaging, is that if you have an add-on USB card instead of a built-in, then you CANNOT download your photos except bu buying an $[money] disk drive adapter.They should have stated this up-front on the package, then I would have bought a different camera......"
2,Olympus D510,I have had the 520s earlier version for a year...while snow showing I stopped to take a picture and dropped the camera for a nano second in the snow...I mean it barely touch the snow. I had just opened it so the lense got a speck of snow on it and the lens has not moved since. I thought once it dried out things would work fine but no....I thought Id just buy a new 520 but if it still has that delay while shooting I may have to try another camers.
1,Mantovani Collection,How in heavens name can I review this CD if I can't hear it?It offers no listen option.There is no listing of what songs are on this CD!Help!
1,Call me slow but...,"amazon is going to release both seasons together for $51.99, while you can get each season separately for a total of $48What's the brilliant idea here?UPDATE February 23 2010:as for today February 23 Season 1 and 2 when bought separately cost a total of $35.98 while Amazon is selling them together for $61.99... which means is $26 more! So you can still call me slow, but that still doesn't make any sense to me!"
4,Big Bazinga Theory,"My wife and I only joined this television show at the start of the third season. One episode and we were hooked. It is now required watching.We could not wait to pop this DVD set into the dvd player and see what we had missed. For what ever reason, the discs could not be read. There are other dvd players in the house but they could not play the discs either. I poped the DVDs into my blu ray and they did play. I was not sent blu discs by accident. The DVDs simply will not play at my house or my Mother's or Sister's. Can't begin to tell you why.The shows are belly laugh funny and repeated viewing does not dull the humor.This show is not to be missed."
3,"Love the series, but the product arrived damaged","I was really expecting the product, cause God knows I love this show. The first season was immaculate, but the second season had the packaged damaged in the inside: a few plastic pieces missing (those where you put the DVDs.After two months of waiting (cause the first delivery got lost, I wouldn't care to complain."
5,great series,not sure about now but when i bought was cheaper to buy these two series seperate than in the two pack
4,Great Price..So So Quality,For that price it was a great..My order arrived within 3 days. The only dissapointing thing was the quality of the dvds..it skipped certian areas. Other than that i really like Amazon so does my husband.
3,"Intelligent, humorous sitcom","A great intellectual sitcom that makes my family laugh out loud. Looking forward to season 3 as we are now hooked!Seller is questionable. Have gotten 2 defective season 1 videos. Then have heard nothing from the seller. Disapponted in seller, love the item. Have to repurchase from someone else."
1,"Terrible ""nu-metal"" garbage that got its just desserts","Oh boy, what a headache. Diesel Machine's only claim to fame was that it featured Pat Lachman, who went on to much better things. This album was a total failure as it was typical in its aural assualt. Bad Cookie Monster vocals, redundant and predictable guitar ""riffs"" and a general lack of anything listenable. The band had two fans - one was an out of work California DJ and the other some spaz who was completely obsessed with the band. Luckily, Diesel Machine broke up way past when they should have. Approximately 10 people bought this album."
3,DISSAPOINTMENT,"I thought Santana was back on the radio for good when Supernatural came out, then I bought As The Years Go By. Being the follow up to the best latin guitarist ever's come back after seven years, I thought that this would be like Supernatural. It's not. It has latin music and that's it. Latin music is good, but notmy favorite kind of music. Supernatural had rock(Put Your Lights On, Smooth), RandB(Maria Maria), and even rap(Do You Like The Way), plus the usual latin music. Supernatural was good partly because of the guests, and As The Years Go By has no guests. As The Years Go By was OK, I guess, but I'd stick with Supernatural. I'd buy this if you like earlier Santana, before Supernatural, or if you like latin music, but not if you jumped on the Supernatural bandwagon. I've been a Santana fan for years, but Supernatural was his best effort and the follow up was nothing like it. Cop Supernatural instead."
3,"No learning, just reaction","I purchased this game for my 5 year old son. The graphics are weak, and there is essentially no learning available. Only racing around trying to follow a wiggly 3d arrow and go from place to place. After 10 minutes, I was stuck at the bottom of the ocean, and there was only one ramp to get out, it takes quite a while to find the ramp. Ultimately this game is boring, perhaps if it had easy, and hard modes it might be OK, but save your money, get a learning game instead."
4,An old friend.,"I owned both these albums on vinyl. Bought them when they first came out and fell in love with the nuances of Dion's voice. Followed his music back to the New York streets and his work with the Belmonts. Now, for those who have not heard, he has given us three fabulous albums of blues music that showcase that gift of a voice he still possesses and the skill on guitar that was originally less evident. Dion continues to be vital, and if you are willing to follow his path, you will find he has seldom not been vital. Sanctuary was always on my turntable in 1971 and when I played those songs this morning, I knew every word, every breath, every emotion captured in this LP. The live stuff at the end of the album isn't as interesting, but, man, those first six songs are gorgeous, searching, and peaceful. Suite for Late Summer is a more consistant album, but Sanctuary's opening set of songs is why I keep coming back."
2,I haven't received this item yet,I'm still waiting for this product. I don't have any idea how long I will have to wait.I hope I don't have to wait to long.
1,SmartDisk Guaranty of one year is worth nothing the first day,"I purchased a brand new FotoChute on Amazon. Very nice seller.He tried to help me without success. The FotoChute arrived in it's original sealed packing did not work. I and your seller had a hard time returning the FotoChute in it's original package with everything in it. When it came back SmartDisk returned only a reconditioned Fotochute, the bag and nothing else. I received this Fotoichute in February and it is now April 21. I have no way of using this Fotochute because SmartDisk has gotten away with a ""Got you!"" I now own an unusable FotoChute with a one year guaranty.I was a satisfied customer of their products owning 2 Firewire and 2 Crossfire HD. I would never buy another SmartDisk anything because their support and guaranty is just plain snake oil."
2,Mac OS 10.4 compatibility problems,I bought this product and it worked OK but when my Mac OS 10.4 was automatically upgradedto OS 10.4.9 my computer now does not recognize the drive.The company said there is nothing I can do.
4,Nice presentation,"This book claims to be a high school level textbook. While it would not serve well as a general survey of early American history, it is a nice introduction to the more narrow field of the influence of Christianity in early American history. In this capacity, it would be a good supplementary text for a course in U.S. history.I also enjoyed reading through it in its own right. It is in this regard light, but pleasant, reading with some interesting points not often seen. The presentation is beautiful with many pleasing and appropriate pictures."
5,Great for Gluten-Free Diets,Great tasting granola. Much better than Apple Cinammon flavor. Goes well with yogurt for breakfast. Excellent for gluten-free diets.
3,Good but with caveats,"Your satisfaction with this product will depend on how you eat it. This is not the kind of cereal you pour into a bowl, add milk and eat immediately. Unfortunately, the cereal is very hard; I would not call it crunchy, it's just plain hard.There are two ways around this. I customarily pour this cereal on top of plain yogurt, add milk and let it sit in the fridge overnight. By morning, the cereal is soft but not soggy. Of course it's not crunchy/crispy either but when you eat gluten-free you tolerate a lot. Alternatively, you can add milk or water to the cereal and heat it in the microwave. It's actually good this way, like a form of oatmeal.I don't mind the flavor, but again, I've been eating gluten-free for 3 years and know not to expect too much. I do like the fact that a serving provides 5 grams of fiber (more challenging to get on a gluten-free diet) and is fortified with vitamins and minerals."
2,Sugar by another name...,"Evaporated Cane Juice is the 2nd ingredient, which is simply another name for sugar - it's just less refined. I'm seeing a lot of 'health' foods with this ingredient, and I find it to be deceptive."
2,"It's great that it's allergen-free, but...","I really appreciate what Enjoy Life is doing by creating products specifically free of allergens. But this just doesn't taste very good, and the texture is slightly off-putting as well. Try their Cran-Apple Crunch or (my favorite) Very Berry crunch for a great-tasting allegen-free granola cereal."
4,LOVE this in Yogurt!,I agree that this granola is not as yummy when eaten like cereal BUT this granola has become a staple in my yogurt eating :). I have used it in regular yogurt or coconut milk yogurt and it gives it crunch and extra flavor. I love crunch in my yogurt and this doesn't get soggy fast. I also really like the chewy raisins. I am not a big fan of raisins but the raisins in this mix are drier and chewier than regular raisins and I really like them.
4,Crunchy treat,"I'm suprised by the negative reviews of this - I eat this as a snack, not a breakfast - a 1/2 cup of this in a baggie taken to work and eaten like I would normally have eaten potato chips - very crunchy, very nice."
1,Not for a snack either,"I purchased this product as a snack item... I have to agree with the other reviewers, this granola is just plain bad. It is hard but not crunchy. The pieces are irregular--some much to large to eat since it is so hard, others too small. I actually came on the web to figure out if anybody found a viable way to use up this product--a recipe or something. So far, no luck."
1,a gluten free blunder,"Typically I find that Enjoy Life products surprise me with how good they are- especially considering they avoid the ten most common allergens in their ingredients. I want to like this product, but it just just does not stand up to the superior taste quality I have found in other products I have enjoyed from this company. The box advertises a ""NEW crunchier taste!"" and, sans the ""er"", the claim would be an outright lie. The product is not remotley crunchy, however, the texture is not wholly unpleasant, though it is visually unappealing. The cinnamon taste is what made this product unpalatable; it is very overpowering and after eating only a few pieces creates an oil like coating on the tongue, that is not at all quick to dissipate. The cinnamon taste is less akin to that of an oatmeal cookie, and more like the taste of cinnamon oil in an inexpensive candy. Sorry Enjoy Life this one's just not for me."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"This was on clearance at my grocery store the other week so I picked up a bag to try it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it reminded me of real oat granola. It was very crunchy, which is a must for me. It has a good taste, maybe a bit heavy handed on the cinnamon which is not a deal breaker for me. Overall, I would say I would purchase it again."
5,Brown Rice Cereal,If your looking for gluten free and oat free this is the cereal for you! It tastes like regular granola but without the oats. I add some hemp seeds to it and rice dream milk and i is amazing.
3,where's the Red String?,"As reviewer MK noted, the red string package did not come with the book. You get a little card giving you a website address, which actually isn't the one you need to get the string. The best way is to go to www.kabbalah.com and search for red string. You have to set up an account, and pay $7.20 in shipping fees. The book is small, but well written. Just know ahead of time what to expect...."
4,KEEP JUMPING,"I read the book and i loved it, do u think the red string is magic? Well that its up to you, what I do think is that wearing it would help u to:* resist your desire to blame others* resist your urge to one up and outdo your friends and foes* resist your impulse to take it all for yourself* resist your doubts about the truth of the Creator* resist the impulse of envy and not cast the Evil Eye at your best friends or worst enemiesWhat's wrong with that?DESTROY YOUR EGOEGO IS:Rage, Anger, Envy, Jealousy, intolerance, frustration, anxiety, pessimism, selfishness, intolerance, worry.What's wrong IN GETTING RID OF THOSE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES?Absolutely NOTHINGLearn it, its worth it, or simple destroy your ego and touch the 99% realm u will regret nothing, r u ready? Cool go for it and never forget:KEEP JUMPING!!I didn't give it the 5 stars coz i believe that it should've come with the red string and it didn't."
2,Be careful when ordering this!!,"Although the book is a GREAT read, and I highly recommend it, this product is advertised as a 2 for deal. The book & the red string. All I received was the book. After weeks of going back & forth with Amanzon and the book company directly I have still get to receive the red string. Amazon offered to discount the purchase price but that's not the point. The point is I purchased something for a reason and want it as it was advertised for, I don't want a credit or a discount, I want what I ordered. Be careful when ordering this because you will only receieve the book and not the 2 for as advertised."
3,Very Simple,"The Red String Book really is two very general and very simple short discussions. There is a discussion on Kabbalah itself - the basics, the purpose, the science and the philosophy. This is fairly well done, and as a long time student, I believe provides a good if very simple overview of Kabbalistic thought. The other part, the middle section of the book, covers the red string itself. My teacher has always taught me not to mix corporeality and spirituality - and the physical mitzvot were a reminder for our spiritual efforts. The Red String Book certainly views the red string and evil eye as a corporeal thing as well as a spiritual one and intomates that kabbalah is a physical as well as spiritual science. Believe what you will, the book is at least easy to get through and gives a clear message - even if you don't agree with all of it."
2,disappointment...again,"I read this book because I felt the author was tackling a subject rarely discussed. However, the book turns out to be more ""sizzle"" than ""steak"". The author starts the book off with same jive that he uses in his other works. The author does not mention any of the sources from where his information was obtained. I would think that the mention of sources would add credibility."
1,I Tried...I Really Tried,"I wanted something in my life, and was even willing to try the cult of Beverly Hills. The book is about the string but doesn't come with it. I have read of people saying that the string is actually used to remind yourself to think positive and do good things. Well if that's true, why should I buy one from Berg Inc.? Can't I just cut off a piece of yarn from anything and tie it around my wrist to remind me? The red string is another one of the Berg Company's money-making ideas. I really wanted this whole thing to be enlightening but it still leaves me empty."
3,Not a new concept,"My grandmother and mother alway pinned a red ribbon on the left side of their children to ward off the ""evil eye"". This they learned from my great grandmother and her mother before. My sister and cousins all do the same. Only difference - we are Italian and Catholic. It is the malocchio - evil eye. No great mysticism there."
1,Do Not be Fooled!,"The Berg family of ""Rabbis"" are nothing but fakes! Sorry to break it to you out there, but the red string means absolutley nothing! Do you actually believe that a red string will ward off the 'Evil Eye'? I mean come on! The Bergs are nothing more than TV evangelists who are in it for the money. I am Jewish and religious and the fact remains that Kabbalah is reserved for Jewish scholars who are learned in bible and advanced in all aspects of Judaism."
3,Red String review,The text is somewhat redundant. The basic idea could easily have been summarized in a few pages. A great effort was made by the author to repackage a superstitious idea and make it appeal to an intelligent mind.
5,Red String Enlightenment,"I had a beautiful experience having a ""red string"" ceremony with two other seekers whom I had shared a previous Kabbalah resource with. It was extraordinarily moving. I wish the instructions had been more explicit as I ""wasted"" some string by cutting it in thirds (there were of us). It should have been more specific about how to ""measure"" the string size before cutting."
3,Questioable results,"If one could get their mind to belive what this book offers, it would be great. Without that the book is just another self-help book on the shelf."
5,Good Camshaft,This does seem to be a good camshaft. I haven't using it long enough to really rate it but so far I like it.
2,"too theoretical, no real financial applications","I am a math finance student who will soon start a summer internship on Wall Street. I want to leave feedback for the best and worst books that I used in my studies so far.I read this book before starting my studies. With what I know now, I can say that the time was not well spent working through it. The mathematics topics are very dry and theoretical. The examples from finance are mostly theoretical and some seemed cooked up and unrealistic. It is a book written by mathematics professors and is mostly a mathematics book (with watered down mathematics) where the finance applications are like second thoughts. It has little to do with what a practitioner would teach (as I saw in my classes) and does not teach things useful in the real world.""The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance"" by Joshi is much better in this respect. And before starting studies, Stefanica ""A Primer For The Mathematics Of Financial Engineering"" is much more useful."
5,Joining the chorus,I can only echo the other reviewers. As far as I can tell this book has no serious competition. This is an excellent introduction to mathematical finance for those with a solid undergraduate level understanding of higher math but without graduate level exposure. I agree that it is ideal for self study as that is exactly what I am using it for. The price is right especially in contrast with its overpriced brethren. Five stars!
4,Extremely Happy to find this!!!!,I was so excited to find Modern Girls!!! Definitely a hard movie to find anywhere!!! But I was very sad that it wasn't published on dvd!!! But I was happy enough to get on vhs!!!
4,A LOOK AT ONE PHOTOGRAPHER'S CAREER,"Although this book may not be of interest to everyone, it should be valuable to anyone who is aiming for a career in photography. This book provides a wonderful glimpse into the work of Robin Perry. Most of the images are quite out of this world. This book was published (in 1974) five years before i was born. I had a feeling this book would be out of print. I consider myself very fortunate to have found it at a used book shop several weeks ago.Anyone who enjoys viewing or creating photography should see the pictures in this book. Each photo is accompanied by a complete description of how and why the image was created."
5,The Boy Who Would Be a Helicopter,"This book helps teachers to see how important play is, as well as how we each have a voice to tell stories. Children have a great imagination and this book helps to see a glimpse of it."
1,More about the author than the subject.,"The book starts out with some very interesting anecdotes about pre-school children and affords an insight into how they think. But that's all it is: anecdotes. It includes such ridiculous quotes by the author as ""The children are using the most reliable structure ever invented for thinking of anything: story."" Unless you are a pre-school teacher, don't waste your time."
2,Lost in child talk...,"I had to choose a book for my class and had read the reviews of this one. To be honest, I thought the book was a bunch of gibberish and never got to the point of the story. Never really understood the use of storytelling in the classroom which the cover says."
4,He puts the other rappers in a triangle choke,Pick this up he flows like the river nile and if your tired of that one candy rapper check Chill out
4,Seems ok,"Have only used it for a week or so, but it seems to work ok. I like the clean smell and the way it lathers."
4,This is my summer cleanser for oily skin...,"In the winter I use a creamier Pond's cleanser, but I like this to strip oil, sweat and general ick and dirt off my skin during the hot season. This is made by the same company that manufactures Nivea, another good brand. I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because it isn't the best for gentle and thorough removal of eye makeup. I also like to use this on my chest/shoulders/back to remove oil and sweat."
5,Another Winner from Fergie,"This was a charmingly written little volume of personal reflections and thoughts on how to live the best life one can live. Fergie, of course, has many examples to back up her short essays, but nowhere does she seem to lay blame for things that have gone wrong and always takes personal responsibility for her past actions.This book reads like a series of personal letters to a good friend who has no axe to grind. Recommended for those who enjoy books with a positive thinking mentality."
4,Molly's Reviews,"Enjoyable Read ........ Recommended 4 starsThe ReviewThe work offered by Sara Ferguson is a series of sketches discussing a wide variety of subjects. `Forgiving the Past,' `Laughing Out Loud' and `Finding Empathy' are but three of the short offerings. One vignette I particularly enjoyed is entitled `Keeping Rituals' in which the writer chats about structure of routine and how important it is for children. Sarah Ferguson tells of her own favorite ritual carried out with her Mother as well as describing rituals she maintains with her own daughters.Enjoyed the read, happy to recommend.Reviewed by: molly martin"
3,"Sararh, Plain and Honest.",A good try at trying to be wise and give wisdomly advise. Think Sarah is finally realizing what it is to be an adult woman in today's world. Nothing she writes here is extraordinarily inspirational. I found it to be pretty much the same realizations I have come to in my life as I near 40 also.
1,A total waste of $11.99 and champagne,"A total waste of money and a good bottle of champagne. No matter how many times I tried, this thing would not stay on the bottle. I should have stayed with my $5.00 metal tops that always work. Oh, and the only reason it got one star... it looks like it should catch drips."
2,Agree with other reviews -- does not fit all bottle types,"I read the product reviews but decided to give this a try because of the brand name and it sounded like not everyone had issues with the saver fitting bottles. I have tried it on eight different bottles of Prosecco, each with a unique neck. The champagne saver has a sliding ""collar"" that needs to be pulled down to secure it to the bottle. It has only secured itself to one out of those eight bottle necks. It will fit on others, but is not tight. Even on the one bottle it fit well, the entire unit was still wobbly.When you depress the lever, it closes a ball valve inside the device to block the air. Honestly, I am not sure how this differs from a standard bottle closure (ones with a flip top and rubber seal). Yes, you have to remove those to pour, but with this item you have to carefully stabilize it when opening the ball valve to pour. I'm afraid it is just a fancy version of the $1.99 bottle stopper."
3,Great concept but hard to fit,"The pour-through feature is what tempted us to try it, but the difficult fit makes it a hard sell at list price. Works great-- when it works. The locking collar is difficult to slide down on most all bottles we tried (about five brands so far) and would not fit one of them at all. One seemed to seal but the top would pop off if pushed sideways at all. Nice try, but back to the drawing board!"
1,Very Disappointed,"As with the first review I read--unfortunately after having bought the product--the device will NOT slide down onto the neck of our bottles.The concept sounds great but, if my favorite bottles of champagne won't accept the device, it really does me no good.Looks like I'll have to find another way to keep my champagne fresh.JR"
4,Start thinking...,"Excellent book - thought provoking, engaging, disturbing, and inspiring. Briggs provides history and context to many of the conflicts going on in the world and looks at the role of children in them. It made me mad to learn more about the injustices happening to children in so many places, but there are elements of hope as well. The personal narrative approach make the book a very accessible and engaging read - I'd recommend it to all!"
1,Duh,"The author has the vocabulary of an idiot. ""Innocents lost""?Also the pic on the cover of a kid on a BSA bike is a stock photo, NOTHING to do with the story. I question its credibility.If it is credible, then I wonder how much is skewed from his lack of command at proper English"
4,I can't believe I'm playing a decade old FPS...,"...and REALLY ENJOYING IT!!! This game is dated, to say the least... from top to bottom. But, it takes me back to why I love first-person-shooters in the first place. You know the story... lots of enemy soldiers, 'bosses' here and there, critters galore, trucks to drive and run over troops, submarines with neat torpedoes (!), lots of gun-play. Graphics are dated too, of course, but who cares! Sometimes kinda hard... don't spend all your ammo in one spot: you'll be sorry. I don't know why I've never heard of this game - but glad I finally did (for under $10 - really hard to beat). Seems like it came out about the time of HalfLife... 2001. Anyhow, it's fun... plain and simple. Recommend... but don't even think about comparing it to 'today's FPSs. Chill out and enjoy it. I am."
3,Red Faction,"Bought it on a whim thinking it would be a nice game to play when travelling!...Not really worth it as it is a bit ""primitive"" and the game is really not that exciting."
5,Awesome Multi Players as well...,"A lot of the people that reviewed this game talk about the built in game with Mr. Parker...which that in itself is yes, awesome. But my favorite part of this game is getting my cousins, husband, brothers and a few friends all on the same map and killing away. The maps that some of the players have created are so much better than a lot of the shooter games out there. Take one of my favorites...the macro maps. You are in a bathroom, that's the whole map...but you're an inch tall:) There's secrets and tunnels and hidden ladders and a snipers heaven! Or the few scary ones (corpse's graveyard and the Halloween one) fog, floating...things and a haunted house...what's more fun than that? We have way too much fun on our weekly shooting nights, this game is not to be missed if you enjoy multi player maps:)"
5,AC has never let me down.,This cable has been strong for me for that past 3 years. I have never had any issues and the quality is great. I've always had a strong signal.
4,Still in the shadow of the blues...,"There is life after Whitesnake for Mickey Moody and Bernie Marsden,with the added talents of legendary Don Airey,Neil Murray,and a Swedish up and coming talent,Stefan Berggren behind the mic.Of course,they cover themselves live,but in a raw and bluesy way;rock'n'roll all the way."
2,Whitesnake minus David Coverdale,"I listed to all the samples available here and I have to say while the instrument playing is top notch, listening to someone try to emulate the great David Coverdale is an unpleasant experience. If you want to hear these songs in the best format, just buy the original WhiteSnake albums with David Coverdale at the helm.Sam ChandraChicagoland"
3,Light Socket Power Dongle,Quick delivery with no complaints about the company. The unit was as described. A weakness of the unit used with a Siriusm Starmate plugged into the power outlet of a Toyato Camry is not secure requiring frequent re-insertions to keep the Sirius unit powered.
4,Very Secure!,"This mount is very secure, and keeps my XM in place very well. It has two pivot, and one rotation point allowing you to get it exactly where you want it. I do wish that the socket was built in, rather than on a cord, but overall a clean decent look, great since I don't want to install anything on my dash."
4,Excellent performer at economy price!,"We bought this phone as a low priced replacement of an older cordless. I've been extremely happy with this purchase and the options this phone has. The voice quality is good and I have not noticed any interference. The only thing I would change is that the volume control (for earpiece) is on the face of the phone, not on the side, making it more difficult to change if you're talking on the phone. Otherwise, great options. 4 different ring modes (not annoying) and an easy to program dialer memory.Highly recommended if you want an excellent performing phone for an economy price!"
3,Live not studio recordings,"I was terribly disappointed in this album. No where in the product details does it mention that the recordings are all live and, it appears, much later in his career. I was looking for the originally released versions of this material. The editorial review makes mention of one live medley, but other than that I thought it would contain studio releases. As far as live albums go, which I have no problem with, this is a fine compilation. I just wasn't aware of what I was getting"
1,The Killer at his worse,I was truely dissapointed with these recordings. I think I got the wrong order ! I like Jerry Lee's ballads and there are maybe two on these cd's. He was not at his best at all unless you like curse words and a lot of yelling!
4,kept my attention,"no not movie of the year, predictable but most part 3's are usually running out of ideas i deep down liked this more than part 2 but not 1 i deep down liked the story moret than part 2 and most horro films people complain to dark even though half of this was at night i had no trouble seeing who was doing what to whom i recomend it ifyou like the first 2 and or hills have eyes anyone agree"
3,"Not terrible, but nothing special","The Wrong Turn franchise is for all intents and purposes a one trick pony show. The first film was decent enough, but its first direct-to-DVD sequel was surprisingly good for its type. Now, here we are with Wrong Turn 3, which finds Three Finger and his crew of deformed hillbilly cannibals back in action and looking for blood. The story picks up with a prisoner transport bus crashing in the woods, and the crew of surviving guards and prisoners are soon picked off one by one, with some spectacularly bloody results. And yes, while Wrong Turn 3 has no shortage of blood, gore, and dismemberment; there just isn't anything shocking enough or compelling enough to hold your interest for long. It's pretty predictable to a point, but there is enough of the horror goods here that makes it worth checking out regardless."
3,Purchased the Collection,This wrong turn is one of my least favorites from the collection but if you love wrong turn you have to watch them all. I just purchased them all while they were on sale to complete my collection and re-watched them all. This one has to do with prison convicts in the woods dealing with the cannibal inbred boys.
2,funny,ha ha ha ah......not even a scary movie. the most unreal scenes i think i have ever seen. but i watched it and it was domb
2,I prefer the first one,"Pretty Good , I thought the jailbirds in the film spoiled what could have been a thrilling plot in the woods"
2,Pretty bad,This is the worst movie i have seen in years. Expected alot more. The fake effects are horrible. Does not even compare with the first two movies at all. Rent it first.
2,1 and 2 are great. This one is meh.,Bad cgi and not as fun as the others. Let's hope that the director of this treats the upcoming 4th entry right.
2,BLOODY MESS,"As a lifelong horror junkie, I've seen too many horror flicks to count. While the first two WRONG TURNs were passable, this third entry is just sloppy film-making, relying on gore rather than real thrills or suspense.The characters are all unlikeable, except Alex, our heroine so we are left with wondering when and how they bite the bullet.Perhaps i've been desensitized by horror overkill, or maybe I'm just tired of sadistic, redundant horror.This is just another pointless sequel that will likely spawn WT4 but I hope my horror addiction doesn't result in my watching it."
2,Wrong Movie to purchase,"This movie looks more like it was made for TV (Like HBO, Starz..)I think the concept was ok but the acting was terrible and the kills were just unrealistic. (The bread cutter, Poll drop thru the mouth from the tree's). This movie was more like comedy of errors than a horror movie. Oh and the special effects on the kills looked as if a high school AV kid did them.I guess this was a good time killer but it was not a good horror movie."
3,Part 1 is better,"I rented this movie two nights ago. It isin't as good as part one. Some of the scenes seemed to cheesy, compared to part one. In part one, scenes were constantly gross. The ending seemed as if it was turning into a soap opera. Becuase you have these jailbirds fighting each other, and yelling, and screaming. To where it was getting redundant. This movie should have had a final conclusion; about the history of the freaks. Since it happened to be part three. Instead of the bizarre ending."
3,Definately a wrong turn,"The trilogy of ""Wrong Turn"" movies needs to cease. Wrong Turn 3...well stay of out prison and out of the Appalachian Mountains of W.Va."
2,Wrong Turn 3 could have used some more work.,"This one of the three Wrong Turns, lacked in many ways. Yes, there were some moments of gore. Yet, the movie lacked in many ways. The cannibals were almost too much of push overs. Sure, the question of who would win the cannibals or criminals win. The movie really never even touched that question at all. Spent most of the time waiting for the good scare, and still waiting for it. So, if you are expecting it to be like the other two. I suggest do a turn around and not risk this Wrong Turn."
2,Not so Good,"The first Wrong Turn movie was awesome, however the sequels to follow are getting bad. Wrong Turn III was not that good. It's just more of the same old stuff with a bus of prisoners this time."
1,Warning!!,"All horror movie fans be advised stay away from this stupid movie, don't even think to rent it. This is the worst movie ever."
1,Wrong Turn 3 [Blu-ray],"this movie is lame, and maybe perhaps because i was expecting a really good horror movie for Halloween night viewing. the movie makes for a good campy/cheesy movie but it ends there. the original Wrong Turn is the only note-worthy movie in the trilogy."
2,Dissapointing,Pretty dissapointed in the third movie. I highly enjoyed Wrong Turn 1 and 2 so I was very much looking forward to the third movie to come out. This one seemed lower quality than the other two. Bad acting and very fake-looking backgrounds at times did not make this movie very scary and thrilling. I would highly recommend renting before you buy so you don't waste your money on this one.
2,wrong turn 3,was a let down as I have seen the first and then the second.. this third make of the mute in the mountains.. pretty lame
2,The 1st scene was great,"As my title says, the 1st scene was great. After that it pretty much stank but maybe worth a rental just for the opening scene. They had one VERY hot girl in the pre-movie kill scene. After that there were pretty much none to be seen. This type of movie needs babes in it IMO."
3,More Gore than the first two but lacking quality of plot!,"I have enjoyed the first two Wrong Turn installments. This third installment lacks what the first two installments provided us with which included a decent plot. I'm not saying I wouldn't watch it this film again and again. However, it will never be my favorite of this series. You should take this film for what it is and not be too critical for it was the second installment to be released to dvd and not have any famous face we come to frequently see. With that said, the film is definitely for any true horror film who has enjoyed the series for what it is and loves alot of gore. This film has a lot more gore than the second installment. So see it if you are a true horror fan or fan of the series."
2,Terrible....,"but what did you expect? There isn't one redeeming quality to this movie. The violence was weak, the nudity was minimal and the acting fell below the keanu reeves line.You cant be weak in all three categories. Not in this genre"
2,Disappointing,"I was anxious for this movie to come out, because I liked Wrong Turn part 1 and part 2 alot. But this movie was a disappointment for me. It looks very low budget and just seemed boring to me. I bought it instead of renting it, because I own the other two. But I would recommend renting this before buying it, unless you are like me and just buy it to have all three."
2,"Worst ""turn"" yet!",After the first two movies which were 5 or 6/10 this one was a real let down. The acting is poor and the story is poor. It would have helped to have more deformed bad guys rather than just one throughout the whole film. As there are families of baddies in the woods I though the film would have progressed from the second film and developed more of a story into the third film but this doesn't happen. The gore is what you expect with a couple of tasty deaths but the acting really is bad and let's the film down badly.You can see why this was a straight to DVD movie..hopefully they don't try and make a 4th one unless a good budget is used. You can see when the actors are in the bus that the road ahead is cheaply added into the film to save money...Don't bother with this film 2/5.
2,"Very Disappointing, Nowhere Near as Good as Second Entry","I really love the second film in this series. It's actually good and surprising. This one is very disappointing. You don't really care about the characters (they're not very smart or well developed), and there's really only one mutant running around killing people so it gets pretty boring. There's also plenty of bad CGI, and the makeup on the psycho is pretty weak. The whole film is forgettable. If you watched the other two, you'll probably see this no matter what, but for everybody else, save your money."
1,FOR THE REALLY DEMENTED PERSON ON YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST,"GIVE THIS TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE.IT IS SO BAD THE ACTORS HAD TO CUT OFTEN TO REGAIN THEIR COMPOSURE.MY WIFE THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD ,BUT GORY.I THOUGHT IT SUCKED,AND WAS TOO GORY.DO NOT WATCH THIS WITH A CHILD OR IF YOU ARE EATING DINNER WITH A MEAT ENTRE.GOERGE ROMERO WOULD BE PROUD OF THIS JUNK!"
3,Wrong Turn for sure,"A weak plot make this segment a real dud, compared to the first two installments."
2,Just not that good.,I enjoyed previous two Turns. This was a bit painful. Seemed like a bunch o walkin in the woods. Took wrong turn renting this.
5,A New Look At Life!,"This is an amazing story. A story full of life, death, mystery, corruption and deceit. A look at life through different/innocent eyes. Full of lessons for today's times.I have read it several times and every time I am more entertained than the last.A definite must read!"
5,"Beautiful, beautiful book!","Buy this book for the artwork alone! Chihuly's beautiful blown glass and paintings are featured on 95% of these thick pages. These are gorgeous, full-color pictures of his art in a book dedicated to the future of the Taos Pueblo. Simply stunning. Hardcover book is wrapped in a transparent dust jacket."
1,There is no instruction.,"It is noted on the dvd that Nadia was never a dance teacher. I wish I knew that before I purchased this. Bluntly put, here is the run down. She has a strong accent. She does not count or break down choreography. She dances and expects the workshop students to copy. The students seemed a little annoyed half of the time. BTW, she dances good; not great. Let's not get crazy here. I noticed that her shoulder pushes are awkward and well, she is wearing high heels to boot. (No offense Neon :) Buy it if you are related to her or if feel like seeing how she dances. You really won't learn anything though."
1,Garbage -- The worst software I have ever purchased,"Save yourself a lot of headaches and look for other software packages to secure your computer. BlackICE is the worst software I have ever purchased: buggy, horrible support, unusable. I have tried similar packages and this one ranks at the bottom of the list. The system crashes continually and I usually needed to re-install at a minimum of once per week. I did some checking after the fact and found others who had similar experiences; unfortunatly I didn't check before I bought the software in the first place. Save your money and find something else."
1,Warning: Obselete,"This program was discontinued in 2008 after the company was acquired by IBM. The software is not supported by IBM, and is not compatible with Windows Vista, 7, 8, or even the latest XP Service Packs. It was a great program in its time, but I would have serious doubts about its usefulness now, even if you do have a computer ancient enough to support it."
1,Bad Investment,This Software is not worth the money or the trouble. I had problems since day one when I installed this piece of junk. My start up programs would not load when the application protection feature is on. Even talking to the support people still haven't got the damn software to work the way is suppose to. Piece of advice. Do not purchase this piece of junk. Stick to Symantec there are far better with their software than what this people is. This BlackIce piece of junk it ain't worth the time or the money. This is the worst software I ever bought.
1,Beware this product!,I recently purchased this product. It did not function. repeated e-mails to the manufacturer got no response. Purchase at your own risk.
1,I may not be fair to this device but....,"I couldn't install it simply because it promised me in the ad on Amazon that it would work with Windows 95, which hardly anything else will do. But when it arrived I found it was really for Window 98 -- not 95 - so I had no choice but to return it.Now I am upgraded to Wincows 98 (ta-dah!) and I wonder if I should spend more money buying it again? It's time wasting and discouraging to be led to think you've bought the right product and then find you haven't."
3,has strange features,The product actually has many excelent features that will make it come out of the crowd
2,Incredibly informative but maybe too high-level for some?,"I purchased this video to show my 6th grade science class and it started off well enough with actual video footage from the CA 1989 earthquake and really got their attention. However, it quickly delved quite deeply into scientific facts, geologic history, terms, etc... While the information was great for me and I learned a lot myself, it was definitely on a much higher scale than my class. I would recommend it for upper-grade levels or advanced middle school science, but not anything lower than that."
1,Too few practical details,"This book is for only someone that wants to browse through the field without actually doing anything. It contains very little information of the kind I was hoping for, like etch recipes with concentrations and temperatures. I used to have the Elwenspoeks ""Silicon Micromachining"". That one is much better, but someone took my copy and it is out of print..."
2,My thoughts,"So I became aware of this movie due to a friend being cast as an extra in one of the fight scenes. So I ordered a copy to show some support. Going in, I knew it wasn't a high budget film and, to be honest, the editing sort of demonstrates that fact. The most obvious proof of that is the final fight scene in the warehouse. The dialogue portion of the scene drags a little before the action starts. On the upside though, the girls give a 100% to the roles. June Marie Sparagna and Donnabelle Mortel add a spark to the, at points, thin script. There isn't gonna be an Academy Award nomination for the movie but it's an entertaining work. There are humorous scenes, action scenes, dramatic scenes, and even a love scene. A little bit for everyone. By no means is this a waste money."
3,It was okay.,"I bought Hood Rats 2 because from the trailer I saw it seemed like a female version of `the Warriors'. Although it wasn't bad in the action department, Hood Rats failed to have any likeable characters. This made watching it progressively more annoying until finally I just fast forwarded straight to the fight scenes. There were two inter gender fights, four xena warrior princess style rumbles, and one very brief sex scene."
4,Zebco Combo,"I purchased 5 Zebco Combos at Christmas for my oldest grandchildren to use at our Lake Home.They have been using them for about 4 months now with no problems. There have been a few broken lines, but we've been surprised at the size of fish they've caught.Everyone is happy with their Zebco."
3,trucks,My son wasn't that interested in Little People but they are nice if your kids like these toys.
3,The Book Is Awesome,"I wanted this CD because I was curious about the songs on it after reading the book ""The Healing Drum - African Wisdom Teachings"" by Yaya Diallo and Mitchell Hall. The CD is a good listen and I plan to re listen while re-reading some parts of the book. This for me is one the best books on music, drumming & African peoples impressions of living in a foreign environment(The West)."
2,Getting Lost,"The first 5 chapters are really about Security Architecture. The rest of the book has a more technical angle. The author totally, in my view, gets lost in words like: Requirements, Services and Controls. He uses these words sometimes at random. Since these definitions are crucial to a good and understandable built-up of any ICT architecture, the reader might get lost.Under design guidelines he talks about the services offered by the a team: Authentication, Authorizaton...etc. etc. Part of those services are Logical Access Controls which he calls ""these controls"". Under Technical Security Requirements we focus on controls that....The main focus of technical security controls is to protect C.A.I, which are at the same time technical security requirements. At the same time: Controls are designed to gover the following actions: again we find confidentiality, integrity..etc.All are requirements, actions, controls and services. Not clear enough in my opinion.The technical part is good."
3,One more manual -- and thats all.,"I own a couple of repair manuals and this one isn't the best. I'm not much of a mechanic and don't find working with engines easy to do, as do many guys. Thus I've been looking for an engine repair manual which will take me through every step necessary in order to maintain and repair an engine -- this one isn't it (at least not for me). Another reviewer of this book found it to be too simple where as I find that it, like most other books of this nature, assumes the reader knows the jargon and understands the principles fairly well to start with. This book, at least for me, left much to be desired. I don't think it is as good as the Briggs and Stratton manual. It covers more engine types but does so in less detail and with less step by step directives. If you are the type of person who doesn't have a technical mind (and I don't) and doesn't easily understand mechanical devises (and I don't), I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Oldie but not a goodie,"Not very up to date old print most of the illustration are the same as the ones I've bought 20year ago, I purchase two different book, small engine up to 5HP and 5 through 20HP, both of the same quality, new front cover old print old picture, One book was copied dated 1990 but the illustration are well over 25-30yr old.I would have though after this long of time they could have updated the material.Rip-off"
3,recommended text,This text was recommended by the instructor of the small enginerepair class sponsored by the Urbana Adult Education Unit 4district. It is bigger and has many more photos than the Demsey book but is less portable and fewer line drawings.
3,Great for Beginner,"This manual is great for the beginner, however the latest and most up to date engines are not included. It's time for an updating of material."
2,Keep looking for a gluten-free granola.,"I paid $5 or $6 for a single bag at the store and am less than pleased with this product. I find it incredibly crunchy in an almost painful way, but it's not stale. The taste is also slightly bitter and, just like another commenter mentioned, there is hardly a trace of berry anything to be seen in this bag. I would really find a different granola if I were you and save the money for something you won't regret."
3,chemical taste,This product is good but since 'enhancing' the fruit it now tastes like chemicals and not real fruit. I much preferred the taste before the enhancement.
2,Disappointing...tastes like imitation food,"I like many of Enjoy Life's products, but not this one. Tastes very ""off""...that's the best I can describe it. I don't like things that taste like artificial fruit, and this has that taste. Also, we take everything into our chiropractor who uses applied kinesiology to test foods on us, and, while my children test fine for other Enjoy Life products, they don't test well for this one. So....keep looking."
3,Has its pluses and minuses,"I chose this granola because most of the ones that come up when you search for ""gluten-free"" have oats in them. I understand some people are ok with them, but many are not. I don't want to mess around with oats.Anyway, this has a bit of a chemcially taste that I don't care for. Also, the berry bits are so tiny and insignificant. I bought some dried strawberries (very expensive) separately to add to it to make it better."
1,Box is misleading,"The box shows strawberries and raspberries on it. The ingredients list dehydrated strawberries and raspberries on it. I found no dehydrated berries in the cereal. If there are any berries, they must be so small they are not disquishable from the granola. I don't care for this cereal at all."
1,you can pick your nose or you can have a friend do it,Great laughs but doesn't really work. It's to bad because I think that would be great to laugh in the morning when you're sticking this up you nose to get that hair that's been tickling all night. To bad so sad would not recommend
3,okay,I bought this as a gag gift for 2 different people. One loves it and uses it as he needs it. The other said it pulls more like tweezers than cut like clippers. Since one loved it and one was not so fond of the use of it - i gave 3 stars (middle of the road)
2,Didn't work well at all,"I was disappointed in this product. I thought this would be funny, but since it didn't work very well, I was not impressed."
3,More for the humour than for the trimming,"My husband wanted a nose hair trimmer and insisted on this one as soon as he saw it. After it arrived, a got a few laughs, it was only used once or twice. He said it pinched a lot and didn't trim very well. It ended up in a junk drawer in the bathroom never to be seen again."
4,track listing,"mas que loca, mejor que tu, tanto amor, aprendiendo a olvidar, para volver a vivir, mal herida, mi marca, aqui entre nos, a ti que te importa, no esperes a manana"
5,Excellent Quality for the Price,"Why pay more when you can get a better product? I've sworn by Acoustic Research products for a long, long time, and they have always met my expectations. This product is outstanding; it delivers top notch sound that is crystal clear. Contrary to what others wrote about the product...it is a standard optical cable. It fits PS3, DVD, HDTV, and whatever else you have. Highly recommended."
5,upstater,This book is so informative. I love the way it is layed out. It is easy to readand understand. I am not a student but just an upstate new yorker who wanted to know more about ny states geology and this answered all my questions. I highly recommend it.
1,Not Happy With Item,Item Was Recieved dirty and wrapped in paper towel. Was not a multi- writer and would not record DVD-R.Not up to the standards I have come to expect from Amazon- More like some of the things I've gotten from Ebay.
3,Cute trinket for Dad,"I bought on behalf of my kid's to give to their father (my husband) for Christmas. It is much smaller than I expected and expensive for such a small item. The Dalek voice sounds like it does on Dr. Who, however, the battery wore down very quickly so now we are on the hunt for a battery. Still, my husband was thrilled with it. It sits on top of his armoire."
1,GHASTLY!!!,"My word, what a horrible album. I have been a Heep fan for 40+ years and have recently been adding to my library the albums I didn't have since I stopped following the band in the mid-70s. This is awful. You don't need a list of the songs printed because on every tune they repeat the title 73 times. When they lost Ken Hensley they lost their sound. The keyboards sound like something you would buy at a department store. This CD is so bad, they actually muck up a cover of the great song ""Hold Your Head Up,"" and destroy ""Look At Yourself"" on a live version tossed on to the end of the album. Truly pathetic AND bathetic."
1,Heep for the (garbage) Heap,"I can live in '72 forever and I will... this ain't Heep, this is swill! Catch 'Sweet Freedom' for the best of the best of Uriah Heep (other than the BONUS TRACK which could have gone by the wayside.) ""Return to Fantasy"" is a heart throb of an album. ""Magician's Birthday"" has some stellar tunes. The only album worse than this one is the superdud ""Equinox""."
1,Horrible,Got this in the bargain bin after purchasing Salisbury. Couldn't believe it was the same group.
1,"Uriah Heep's worst album, ever.","How the mighty have fallen. This one is simply awful. It originally came out in 1990, and has been described as a Bon Jovi soundalike. I wouldn't even be that generous with this album. If it deserves comparison to anything, it is to what the Christian band Petra was doing around the same time - same lame attempts at social commentary in the lyrics, same limp, going-through-the-motions ""hard"" rock, same hoarse grade-B vocals that suggest Bruce Springsteen trying to sound like Steve Perry, same unimaginative compositions that merely recycle what was being played on the hair metal stations at the time. The album cover and title are both blatant copies of Manfred Mann's 1976 album _Roaring Silence_. A waste of money, unless you think Petra's _This Means War_ was the pinnacle of rock."
5,Bob Works,"Bought it at Comp USA, salesman said it was pretty good. Anyway decided to try it on my home network. I was moving from 98 S.E. to XP Home. First attempt didn't work. I needed the latest version, got it off their site. Using the latest version over my network worked like a charm. Highly recommend it, but read the manual, and check out their support site. Get the latest verison if you want it to work for you. Moved Office 2k, all my email, and several appliacations, that I didn't have CD's for. You can't beat bob."
1,Important Use Restriction,"Unfortunately I purchased this product before reading user reviews. Buried in a side panel on the box is a statement that the product is licensed only for one pair of computers. This is a very important fact and should be more prominently disclosed.Fortunately I read this condition of use in the manual inside the sealed box before I opened the disk envelope.Considering the cost of the software and apparently how marginally it performs based on other user ratings, I returned it for a refund."
1,Waste of Time and Money,This was a total waste of time and money. And the company won't give a refund if you request it after 30 days of purchase.It promises a lot but delivers nothing.I would give this a negative 5 stars if I could.
1,Aggravation,Trying to get this software to do its job was just total aggravation. All I did was waste time and money trying to get to do what it's advertised to do. I went back to re-loading software manually.
5,Best migration product on the market!!!,"I've tried numerous products, Desktop DNA, Detto Intellimover and even 3.0 of Alohabob. None of those products did exactly what I needed it to do. PC Relocator 4.0 met my expectations completely. If you need to move stuff from your old pc to your new pc and don't have the time to do everything manually, definitely buy this product"
1,Works Terrible,"$[money] bucks for a product that comes with a parallel cable? So SLOOOWWWWWW!!!!!! They wanted another $[money]for a USB cable, crazy. I tried moving apps, but it corrupted my system and I had to reload everything over again. Installing apps from the CD is so much faster, and legal unlike making copies which AlohaBob does. Get IntelliMover by Detto Technologies if you want to just move settings and files. It's 5 times faster, safer and has a built in file transfer utility you can keep using."
5,This is a Great Anime,This one of the best anime I have ever seen.Not only will it make you laugh but the sweetnesswill touch a special place in your heart. The lasttwo episodes were the most touching but I found allthe episodes uplifting with their sense of japaneseestyle humor. I would recommand this to anyone with asense of humor.
4,"Funny, very cool","The series is quite short with only three hours total however, this is one of the funniest short series you'll ever seen. Photon has a lot of twists and turns especially during the last hour of the series. Overall, this series is a must see!"
3,"Good series, bad ending","Let me start off by saying the ending seemed rushed, and made little sense. The emperor suddenly showing up, and the strange battle, as they tossed the words a-ho and una-ho around so much it made no sense what tehy were talkign abuot after a while. But in teh end they get him. It seemed like that series should have been longer, so the fight could make better sense."
1,This is not football,"This game is a pile. The game play is too complex even on the rookie level, and the ""kicking game"" is so confusing there is no hope of knowing what you are doing. The AI offense is unstoppable, the only way to win is to score on every possesion and go for 2. I do have to give props to 989 for making Dan Fouts sound intelligent"
4,Review For Gameday 2002,"Gameday has some really sucky graphics. well, they aren't THAT bad, but they r no better than they were last year. The only good thing is its fun. Now, all people care about when they look at the game at the store before they buy it, they just care if the graphics r good. The game can suck, but if they had good graphics, more people would buy it. This game is fun, but the graphics suck."
1,Just useless,I use Vacu Vin stoppers for my wine and have been very happy with them. But this...it only holds a seal about one out of every four times I try. And how do you know when it's held? By breaking the seal. It's just a crapshoot as to whether the food is in a vacuum or not. So I just don't use it.
3,"works, but too fragile","the marinater works well, and you can really taste the flavor all through the meat.However, it is somewhat cheaply made, and breaks easily just from pumping it. The lid on mine broke (and leaks enough air to make it useless) after only a few uses just from the pressure."
2,Much Too Small,If you live alone this item can marinate your meal but if you expect to feed anyone else you can just forget it. YOur family or guest will just get theirs right out of the fridge. You would have to buy one of these for each person who was comming over. All the positive reviews hear must be single people. When I opened the package I was startled on just how small this item is. As for the one item it does marinate it does a fine job.
2,Product is ok but,"I used my marinator twice a month. After a year of use, the lid cracked and container would not hold its seal. Lid cracked along top, near rubber vac. hole. Clearly it broke from the suction action of pumping, not misuse. Loved the thing but it definately did not marinate well in 5 minutes (or even 30 minutes) but worked very well when I'd prepare foods in the AM before work and stuck in fridge. At least it made me THINK I was doing a better job.After it cracked, I threw it out and bought bag/jar sealer...much more versatile."
1,"After one month, no longer holds a vacuum","This product sounded good, worked OK until I took the manufacturer at its word and started washing it in the dishwasher. After only four trips through the dishwasher it no longer holds a vacuum more than a few seconds, and I am left with an expensive dish. If you think you might want this product even though you won't be able to put it in the dishwasher, consider that it is so small, only two pint and a half capacity, that it barely holds meat enough for two people let alone a family, unless the meat is in small pieces."
1,"No directions, It cracked","I bought the Vac Vin marinater as well as extra stoppers so I could use the same pump to seal wine bottles as well. The Vac Vin itself came with a few marinade recipes but no directions. I used it a few times and was pleased with it. One day when I was pumping out the air the suction must have been to strong and the top cracked, but as I said there were no instructions as to how much was too much. I cannot find any information on how to contact the manufacter to find out about having the part replaced. So now I am left with a broken piece of plastic."
3,Don't put lid in the dishwasher!,"After using the product successfully several times and always handwashing it, I went ahead and washed it in the dishwasher once and used air dry. The manual says the lid and bowl can be placed on the top rack of the dishwasher, but the lid now 'leaks' a little. It still sort of works but the vacuum is lost after about an hour."
3,Wonderful.... when it works.,"Like the other reviewer below, I bought the Vac Vin marinater as well as extra stoppers so I could use the same pump to seal wine bottles as well. I used it for a number of months but the top lid cracked at the seal and it's no longer useable. When it worked, it did an amazing job at marinating meat (steak and chicken usually) in no time at all. This is not a gimmick but a scientific fact that vacuuming will maranate something much faster.Bottom line, don't over pump it as I, like the other reviewe, can't seem to find the company and am now stuck w/ some broken plastic."
4,Excellent kitchen helper,"I received the Vacu Vin for Christmas a year ago. I asked my husband to pick one up for my father for Christmas. Luckily my husband thought to get one for me for Christmas,too. It's great. I do a lot of grilling and I always forget to marinade things ahead of time. The Vacu Vin cuts your marinade time down to minutes. The marinade really penetrates the meat well. I'd give it at least a half an hour, but after a half hour it tastes like it's been marinading all day. It's a must have for the summer!!"
2,NOW you tell me!!!,"Wished I'd read these reviews! I'd had mine for a year or two (loved it), when it violently imploded, spewing sticky Teriyaki marinade all over me, my kitchen and everything in it! Not fun. I emailed the U.S. division of Vacu Vin, they offered a refund of the suggested purchase price, and I sent the unit back to them. This model is no longer being made, as they are working on manufacturing a newer, larger model. Hopefully, it will be made sturdier and come with better user instructions and warnings!"
1,WARNING! DANGEROUS PRODUCT!,"I was pretty happy with my Vacu Vin Vacuum Instant Marinater at first. It did what it claimed to do. But after only a few months of use, one morning, as I was marinading a big salmon fillet, the vacuum marinater made a deafening popping noise and imploded when I lifted it up from the counter to put it in the fridge! The whole bottom fell out and the sharp plastic pieces cut both my wrist and my foot. It was a really horrible experience and I don't think the company should sell a vacuum marinater with a plastic body that's not strong enough for the vacuum pressure."
2,Warranty not long enough!,"I was given this as a gift two years ago and now it doesn't hold a vacuum. I do not have a dishwasher, so I have always hand washed it. Keep in mind if you buy this, it worked fine for me. The one year warranty doesn't seem like a fair trade off."
1,Bottom fell out,"I bought this item and put it in the refridgerator for an hour when I went back to start cooking I opened the refridgerator and had Italian dressing all over the place.The bottom broke completly out, It took me a hour to clean up everything, very cheaply made!! I just bought the food saver vacuum marinator I like it much better"
2,Too small to be practical,"This item works well, but it's way too small unless you're cooking for one or perhaps two at the outside. It takes up way too much space in a cabinet to be worthwhile. If you have cupboard space to spare, are cooking for yourself and have money to burn, get it, otherwise, save your money for something else."
2,This thing will implode!,I really liked the Vacu Vin. I used it a lot and found that if you pierced the meat with a fork before you added the marinade and pulled the vacuum that it worked great. Then one night I was marinating chicken in Italian dressing. I pulled the vacuum and then boom! I (and the kitchen) were covered with chicken and Italian dressing. Took a hour to clean up the mess. I think I probably pumped it too much and pulled too much of a vacuum. The instructions should really warn customers about this. I'd like to purchase another but I'm a bit shelled shocked at the moment.(I don't think the cat will ever return to the kitchen if he sees another one!)
3,Placebo effect?,"I've not been able to detect any special effect on the meat as a result of keeping it under a vacuum while marinating. If you think about it, a vacuum should actually withdraw the juice from the meat rather than infuse it with your marinade (though I haven't noticed that the meat is drier). On the other hand, the device has a substantial impact on guests if you release the vacuum with a long impressive ""pssssss"" in their presence before grilling. They will notice the difference even if you can't."
2,Replacement Parts Problem,"The marinater worked will until the rubber seal stretched and would no longer seal the top to the base......and I have just spent at least 30 minutes on AMAZON and still have no source for replacement of the seal.......I think that AMAZON should also consider this when they are setting up sales for items. Many require replacement parts to continue functioning....and this is certainly true of the VacU vin products....If the seal does not fit well, the vacuume will not hold......"
3,A nifty little item but..........,you have to have the forethought and time to use it. It ended up on the unused appliance shelf.
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I know, I know - you're reading all those positive reviews, thinking ""WOW now I can like marinate all sorts of stuff real quick and throw it on my...grill!"" right? WRONG...this thing is USELESS. ""Open the pores"" - are you KIDDING me? I gave this thing every advantage - I used a non-thick marinade so it could soak in easier, I tenderized the chicken so it's ""pores"" would open more easily, I left my vacumn-sealed, marinade-covered chicken in the fridge for an HOUR to no avail - the chicken was as bland as if I had done nothing. Not to mention the dish is made of PLASTIC so you have to transfer your supposedly ""marinated"" food to another dish if you want to bake. Yay more dishes to clean!...PLEASE don't get it!..."
2,Broke the container,"I used this product for 2 months and then one time when I had taken it out of the fridge and left it on the counter with food inside, the container cracked and broke. I was very dissapointed in the material. The lib was fine and didn't break, but if a temperature difference would affect the vacuum seal, they should have posted a warning."
2,Wait for a future model,"My husband and I registered for the VacuVin Instant Marinator for many of the same reasons as others did...for a quick marinate when we were on the run. However, after a couple of uses, the VacuVin exploded in our refrigerator. Yes, I'm sure that we must have 'pumped' too much air into the container. But, there should have been some sort of 'limit' indicator. Fortunately, it was a citrus marinade and wasn't too hard to clean-up.While the idea is good, this product needs a little more work."
5,Works better than expensive sealing systems,"After having originally purchased this item from a mail order catalogue and being very impressed, I ordered a second container of the same type from Amazon.com. Since there were additional containers available in a different configuration, I ordered those as well. Compared to my expensive bag sealing system and canisters, these are much less expensive, work as well if not better and are attractive on my kitchen countertop for storing fresh coffee beans and other items needing to be sealed away from air to keep them fresh. I highly recommend them, I have not yet run out of ideas for using these containers, even after more than a year of use!"
4,What a great little invention!,"Sometimes you're in your house thinking ""wouldn't it be cool if you could...??"" and then one day you're on amazon and you realize...you CAN! That's what happened to me with the VacuVin. I'm a huge fan of marinating meat before grilling or roasting but I don't always think ahead or decide ahead what I want for dinner that night. The VacuVin makes it possible to get a late start and still have nicely marinated meat. It's also a nifty vacuum-sealed storeplace for raw chicken or other foods that go bad quickly when exposed to air."
5,MOST TENDER & FLAVORFUL MEAT YET!,"This is the best new item on the market. It's absolutely true that in a few minutes, under vacuum, this container yields the most flavorful & tender meat you'll ever eat. The meat is also juicier. We do a lot of grilling in the Summer & probably use it daily, with several different marinades. The vacuum just seals in the marinade----it's amazing. The only down side is, I wish the company also made a larger style---I'd buy that size in a minute also."
4,ENERGETIC,THE BEST THING OF THIS VIDEO IS ELVIS APPEARS TO BE HIMSELF AND IT SHOWS IN HIS ACTING.COUPLED WITH HIS MUSIC HE DELIVERS A SOLID PERFORMANCE.THE VIDEO IS ALSO A CHANCE TO SEE ELVIS IN THE SAME MOVIE AS HIS FOLKS FOR THE FIRST TIME.STRANGELY ENOUGH ALTHOUGH THIS IS ONE OF HIS FIRST FILMS IT APPEARS TO HAVE MORE SKILL AND WORK THAN SOME OF HIS LATER FILMS.BOTH ACTING AND SINGING IS VERY NATURAL AND SEEMS LESS COMMERCIAL.THIS IS MUST FOR ELVIS FANS AS HE PROVES HIS TALENTS HAVE NO BOUNDARIES.
4,Educational and Fun!,"My 1st grader really enjoys this game. It has a variety of language, math and problem solving exercises and presents them in a fun and engaging manner. You can also adjust the level of difficulty within the game to keep things interesting. I highly recommend. Would have given 5 stars, but there are a few items within the navigation/interface that could stand a little improvement, but nothing major."
5,Coooooooooool Movie,"I loooove sailor Moon! I didn't see this episode/video before but as you might have guessed I surfed the web so I know some stuff about it. So they figure out that Hotaru is sailor saturn, the sailor scout of silence! She now has enough power to destroy the world! Then her father turns her evil!"
4,Size runs small,Got the boots. Love the boots. Had to exchange the boots for a larger size.Joel's wife. :)
1,Poor Sizing,I bought these boots for my wife. I have always had a good expereince with Sorel products. They have protected my feet in the winter for the last 40 years. My wife liked the styling of the boot. BUT she could not get the boot on. I had deliberately bought the boot a size larger that she normally wears. She could not get the boot past her ankle. I would guess that the boot is at least 4 sizes smaller than marked.I will say the refund process went very well.
5,Not as small as everyone says,"Based on everyone's reviews I ordered a size larger- I'm an 8 and ordered a 9. They are really too big but I'll just ""make do"" since we live in San Diego and I'll hardly ever need them. I'll just wear extra socks to fill up the space. An 8.5 might have been plenty."
2,Wayyyyyyy too smallllllllllllllllllllllll!,I cannot believe it-ordered a size 10 (I take a 9) and could not get it on over my heel. Even with the side zipper undone. jeesh!Now they have none large enough for me - had to return them unused and start looking all over again.
4,good buy,good buy had a hard time fitting the bracket to the mount after though had to pound it out more so that it would fit on top of it with this thing on. really helps the stability of the car quite noticeably. may make more vibrations at idle though/ overall no complaints good buy
4,Amazing,ive had this system for a while and I HAVE TO SAY THE SOUND AND BASS IS AMAZING!! for a the price. it could be better setup ( alot of wires) but once its setup it good...
4,Foods that Heal,The book was in very good condition. It's a great referencebook for establishing better healthier eating habits. It'seasy reading and very informative.
2,a disappointment,"I love Dieselboy, been to many shows. I find it hard to believe that he made an album of such crap. Compared to his other cd's this one blows. Don't buy it. It sucks. Two good songs on it. You've been warned."
4,Worth the price,"For the price, this is a great VCR. I have had one since June 1999 and it has worked great. I miss not having a clock/timer display on the front. It's hard to tell whether you're playing/forwarding/rewinding a cassette just looking at the display. I like the fact that many controls are available on the face when you're unable to find the remote."
5,Great book on modern strategy in the middlegame,"Watson provides a much needed update on Pachman's classic, but somewhat dated work on chess strategy. The subject may seem dry and difficult to some, but the book reads like a thrill. The layout is so good and the explanations so clear that you do not need a chess board to follow the discussions of conceptual issues (although you will need to set up the pieces to analyze the technical details, of course). Watson is entertaining and instructive at the same time.Outstanding work. Five stars."
2,Somewhat difficult to understand,"I think this book had some very good pointers. However, for an advanced beginner, or lower end intermediate player the way it explains things is difficult to understand in several areas. If you are advanced this book would be good, but it doesn't make it clear in the advertizing that this book is for advanced players only."
5,We love it,"I am German and my husband is American. Since we live in Germany we needed something to improve our daughters (2 years) English and since she loves Maisy we got this DVD. The voice of the narrator is very pleasant, the stories are funny and entertaining. Our daughter gets scared really easy (we got her a Baby Einstein - the one with the farm animals and she refuses to watch it because of the real life cows), but Maisy is absolutely save. Nothing bad happens, nobody gets hurt, little problems get solved right away - just the right thing for a toddler. Even so we watch two or three of the little episodes every night with our little girl, my husband and me are not tired of it yet. If you have a Maisy fan in your house this is a must have!Like all the other customers we also hate the fact that you have to fast forward the commercial at the beginning and I was thinking about deducting a star because of it. But the Maisy part of the DVD is wonderful so we did not."
1,Sound is bad,Sound is bad has a clicking in background.Not sure if this was used but wasn't sold that way. Not happy.
4,Sharp 27NS500,"The Sharp 27NS500 was an exellent purchase. the colors are crisp and clear, and the picture quality is top notch. The picture held up well to DVD as well as tradional VHS playback. The front and rear A/V inputs are easy to use, and well planed out. All in all a wonder ful television for the budget minded consumer. A wonderful deal."
4,Sailor Mars my favorite scout forever,"I love sailormoon, and I have most of Sailormoon S on dvd.....Sailor Mars revelations are revealed here, as well as the Sailor of Destructions true identity....don't miss it!"
5,Saturn Steals the Spotlight,"This is volume 5 of 6Hotaru and Chibi-usa monopolize the fifth volume of the S series. All of the episodes center around Hotaru, as her strange powers assert themselves and her true identity made known. I have little tolerance for Chibi-usa, but even I found these episodes to be watchable. The ep where Mimet jams everything she can get her hands on into the Daimon machine is funny. The wierd twisting of dimensions causes some very wierd things, right when the evil Professor Tomoe is on a trip to the store to pick up some snacks for his organization (I'm not making that up!) Eventually, Hotaru's true identity is revealed, but that just makes chibi-usa all that more adamant that her friend isn't a bad person. If you like Hotaru, or are a fan of the Outer Senshi, this is a good DVD to buy."
1,T-100 Door Handle,The part was poorly made and did not fit very well. Doubt it will last more than a few months.
4,nice set of puzzles,"this is a really nice set of puzzles that come out of a frame and then snap back in with high interest subjects for a 3 year old beginner puzzle worker.However, this is an example of amazon over pricing. I paid much less for mine, I have several sets. this is a very nice set with the horse, dogs, and ocean life. The puzzles have held up for years with a day care setting. They are a great size for 3 or 4 children to sit at a kitchen table and work on their own puzzle puzzles.Maybe they are worth 30bucks ????"
2,not as described,Bought this to hook up my sub.Excited to get it only to learn that it wasnt what was pictured.VERY DISAPPOINTED.
2,Item not as pictured,This subwoofer cable does NOT include the y-splitter as the item image seems to indicate.
5,Good and cheap cable for subwoofer,"This cable works. For the price you pay, i think it is a good buy vs those of much higher cost. Not sure is there much difference."
1,Product Description was not clear,Item didn't describe clearly that it was just speaker without subweafer.It was just a wastage of money
3,okay but the first two were better,"i enjoy this, but when given the choice between all three in the buzzin' fly trilogy, i prefer the first two. the third disc just isn't as memorable. i strongly recommend volume 2."
1,Don't waste your money,"Not that good. The singer is average AT BEST. The songs all sound the same. It was hard to distinguish the difference in each song. I was hoping for a Southern Rock sound, but the band seems confused with their identity. It was like listening to a high school garage band that's trying too hard. The lyrics were unique, though. Maybe they sould put down their instruments and attend a poetry reading."
2,Novelty record without much to recommend it,"OK, so they're a punk band singing about cubicles and pencil sharpeners instead of sex and drugs. While the idea is moderately amusing, there's nothing special about the execution. The jokes are pretty obvious, and the music-- well, at first I thought that was a joke, too, but I'm afraid it's not; these guys really are that hackneyed. Beyond the gimmick, this band doesn't have much to recommend it."
2,An expensive choice,"Sorry, but this is definitely not worth the money, it's a dream interpretation book in a small format with a bit of Kabbalah thrown in, I think there are better books on the market!"
2,The soundtrack for this is only good in the film (which itself is meh).,"In the film, this score is decent (incredible, really, and immersive). I'm a fan of soundtracks. And some are incredible. I think for ""soundtrack matched uup with events in film"" this is one of the best.That said, extract this out of the film and it's pretty lame imho.This is not the same for all soundtrack. master and commander and pirates of the carribean for example are superb in film and out.Out of film, this one isn't too catchy (in film it's super though). jolly good."
3,"A Good Experiment, and Worth a Read","I like to see any new attempts at rigorously analyzing qualitative data, especially attempts that don't merely rely on simple coding. I also like to see visual and schematic thinking in action. Moretti's book isn't quite a revelation, not quite the start of a revolution, but it's worth exploring. Maybe one day he'll be acknowledged as one of the granddaddies of a new kind of thinking. Absolutely worth reading and digesting, but don't necessarily expect it to rock your world."
1,What the heck?,"Don't bother buying this from Amazon since apparently they are rip off sellers. Though the description clearly says 5 piece drum kit with the Sonor 100 series hardware.. the package only contains 1 bass drum, 1 floor tom, and 1 tom tom and 1 head for each. So one of the toms is missing, there is no snare.. no bass pedal, and no hardware to speak of at all aside from some screws that don't seem to go to anything.Horrible service. And now they want me to pay the [...] shipping to return it. That I'll do, and I'll never buy from this site again."
3,Great quality BUT buyer beware!,"These are some very well constructed cables. Nice quality, BUT they are VERY bulky and combersome. I could not even fit 2 of the prongs into the back of my TV because the connection heads are so wide. You can unscrew the sheath like sheild to make it fit better, but its a bit of a hassle."
2,Extremely stiff cables,These cables carry a signal fine but not pleased with the very stiff rubber covering. Have to really bend and twist them to reach certain angles. The connectors are also too tight and non-adjustable. I had to use a little extra force to join them to electronic devices and afraid they will cause damage if I had to take them off someday.
1,Too Bulky to Plug In,"Unfortunately, even after unscrewing the protective heads, these cords/tips are so bulky they could not be plugged in on any TV I own or that my parents own, and I had to return the product. I would recommend buying a different brand; the other set of cords I bought worked just fine."
3,A jumble of characters,Mr. White kept adding characters until finally I just couldn't keep track of who was who and who did what!! A real mumbo-jumbo!
2,"Insipid hero, Unappealing Characters, Unbelievable Storyline","I found this book to be most disappointing. Dr. Alan Gregory is written as a surprisingly passive, certainly insipid, and generally unappealing protagonist. The women in the book are a stereotypical, albeit disappointing, blend of ""toughness"" and sexuality, supposedly with dashes of intelligence thrown in. Interestingly, these women, along with so many other stronger characters in the book, seemingly pull the perpetually weak, and befuddled Gregory by the nose throughout his ""adventure"". .... All in all, very disappointing."
4,Excellent Jonathan Kellerman clone,"Jonathan Kellerman is a psychologist, he lives in Los Angeles. He began publishing thrillers in 1985. Stephen White is a psychologist, he lives in Boulder, CO. He began publishing thrillers in 1991. Kellerman's protagonist is a psychologist who lives in Los Angeles. White's protagonist is a psychologist who lives in Boulder. Kellerman's Alex Delaware has a friend who is a gay Los Angeles police detective. White's Alan Gregory, by way of contrast, has a friend who is a straight Boulder police detective. Delaware took a long time to settle a case of Munchausen's by proxy; in this book Gregory does it in record time.All of this suggests that White is not very original, which is true. But do you really want an original mystery/thriller? If you like Kellerman, you should like White."
3,SERVICEABLE SUSPENSE NOVEL.....................,"Alan Gregory is a Boulder psychotherapist with a stunning soon-to-be ex-wife and an equally stunning girlfriend. The highlight of his life appears to be the tug-of-war going on between the two women, until a hostage situation involving his good friend and business partner ends with murder. Worse yet, the danger doesn't stop there; and when Alan's own patient becomes the subject of a murder investigation, it falls to him to prove his patient's innocence.Somewhat of a disappointment, the storyline was to me at times complex and somewhat confusing. I had some difficulty keeping all of the characters straight, and really liked no one in the book. If edge-of-your seat action and suspense is what you are looking for, you won't find it here.DYB"
2,Confusing and endless,"The first White book I read was MANNER OF DEATH. This one seemed to go on and on and on without going anywhere, sort of like walking or running on a treadmill. It never seemed to go anywhere until the end where he tied it together FINALLY!!. The characters were fractured as well as the storyline. I could not keep track of all the characters nor did I want to because frankly they were not that interesting. A disappointment compared to MANNER OF DEATH."
5,The beauty of friendship revealed...,"The relationship between Cutter and Skywise, two male elves who are ""brothers in all but blood,"" is explored in-depth in these marvelously written stories. The illustrations, though not by Wendy Pini herself, are at least decent, unlike some of the other recent ElfQuest books. I could not give higher praise to such a celebration of an aspect of relationships too rarely seen in modern culture."
3,Alison and brians not so exellent adventure,"I just read this and am under the impression they were a couple,alison is an attractive women.Anyway this is a real page turner and I'm surprised hasn't been filmed yet,(as far as I know)Some minor quibbles over the obvious ... retentive style of our heros and there fanatical revenge obsession that blew a dynamite load of hash out of the water aside I reccomend this book highly as a thriller.A real life chiller.Stop prohibition 2 before we get Mafia 2 that will take over the planet.Please,legalize all ... now.Thank you."
4,Excellent for the money,"Extremely cheap guitar, and shipped quickly. If you don't examine it too carefully from up close, the black body actually looks really beautiful. I am a complete beginner so I love the smaller size of the guitar. A huge problem came up when I had a friend of mine tune the guitar for me--all the frets on the guitar are placed incorrectly, making the guitar impossible to tune perfectly. Every chord I play is a little off. I've contacted toolprice and they arranged to ship a replacement immediately."
1,cheap,"I wanted to buy a guitar. I wanted to get the red one. Got the black one. its a kids guitar. and a cheap one at that. No truss rod. Which means once its starting to sound funny, then chuck it. Save up. Do yourself a favor and buy a decent guitar. Do research. DO NOT buy guitars based on price."
2,Not 100% copper,"This speaker wire has a non-conductive core made out of a material that is not copper so it is not truly 12 gauge copper wire as far as copper content goes, it is something thinner. To make matters worse, when the ends are twisted to allow for the speaker connections, some of the non-conductive material moves from the core to the outside and can contact the connection posts. Not a happy camper."
4,"Great product, but VERY thick jacket","The wire looks and feels really high-quality, but the wire jacket is so thick that it doesn't fit in a standard banana plugs. I had to exchange it for a different kind of speaker wire."
5,Excellent value!,I was looking for something small to add to a Christmas gift and this was such a good find! The price is great and you get 10 full-length movies! Any child will be excited to open this up! Highly recommend. There are other themed packs as well... check them out!
3,copy of a copy of a copy,"Either this disk was used and abused, or is it as copy of a copy of a copy... Terrible quality. My son watched it once and to the trash it went."
5,How Could You NOT,"How could you not love these movies?They come at a time when you can still get good quaility movies without alot of sex, drugs......Movies that you can watch with the whole family.The books are better, but they have tried to keep as much of the story line as possiable."
2,Harry Potter Years 1-4 Movie Set,"loved the movies however I didn't like the fact that I had ordered ""new"" product and that the Goblet of Fire movie that was in the set was not new but used. GOF movie was missing the scene info along with other info I wanted to save with the movie. not real happy with my purchase...."
2,Disappointed customer,"Very disappinted with my first buy from this seller.Movies arrived on time, but it wasn't what I ordered or expected.I bought a Box Set of Harry Potter, years 1-4, but 4 separated movies arrived, not a Box Set. Besides, the seller claims that he has the only Full Screen versions available on the market, one of the movies, Goblet of Fire, is NOT a full screen version, the box is a full screen version, but the DVD inside is marked and it is a Wide Screen version.I would really like my money back !!!!!!!!!!!Very, very disappointed indeed."
2,No need to buy If .....,No need for those who already owned Harry Potter DVD separately to buy this box set edition. I have bought the box set which contains 3 of Harry Potter movie and found nothing different with the 3 Harry Potter DVD which sold separately. I just wait for Harry Potter DVD collection box set which contains all Harry Potter movie : 1 - 7 release in Uncut/Unrated Version and DTS surround sound.
4,Why buy this when I already have movies 2 & 3?,"I already have movies 2 & 3 and would like to buy movies 1 & 4. I see on Amazon that I would spend $30.95 and no shipping if I bought only these two movies in the widescreen versions. What does the box set offer regarding movies 1 & 4 that buying them separately does not? The box set boasts 8 discs. If I add movies 1 & 4 to my collection will I not also have 8 discs?I'm just curious. I've read the descriptions and wonder if I'm missing something. Thanks all!I love Harry Potter and would love to start showing them to my son. However, I'd like to start with the first movie, LOL."
4,Bit Early for a Collection in'it?,"Why bother even making a Collection, when there are still 3 (maybe more) to be made?Sure so they can get Money, or if People have never seen them before.....But if they have'nt, then get them seperatley!!!!!I mean, there bound to be the same Price anyway!I mean honestly!"
5,Harry Potter= Great Movies,Not only were the books in this series gripping and unbelievable but the movies were excellent in how the characters and events were vividly depicted to give a new meaning to the entire series.
5,Great Series,No movie is going to keep with the book. Its not possible. That said....these are great movies. They kept me interested from the start and waiting for the next one. I recommend them to anybody.....AFTER reading the books.
2,Not as good as buying the movie as a single,"The movie, (The Sorcerer's Stone) was good, of course, it was just disappointing in that it didn't include the deleted scenes section. I was looking forward to seeing this as I had seen them before but this version did not include it. Very disappointed!"
3,Profit over Quality,"For a boxed set, it'd be nice to have all four movies packaged as nicely as the first two. They have slipcases and fold open like a book. The third movie is your standard two-disc case with an insert pamplet. The fourth doesn't even have a pamplet. The box they all come in is pretty flimsy (mine came rather beat up). A sturdier one would have been nice."
2,Harry Potter Years 1-4,"DVDs were all opened, except for year 3. Year 1 has several scratches where the movie skips."
4,"Good package, but different style","Different style of DVD package in Years 1-2 and Years 3-4, first two disc are placed in additional case."
4,Why buy 4 when you can get 7?,"I don't understand why people review products they haven't used, seen, etc. Actually I don't know why I'm writing a review myself. I just wanted to say that it seems pretty pointless to buy a box set of the 4 movies when there are still 3 movies left to be made! If you haven't watched the previous 4 movies, rent it out on DVD. (That is, when dvd 4 becomes available.) Otherwise, I suggest saving your money for the box set that has all 7 movies.However, that doesn't mean I don't think this box set has poor quality. On the contrary, I wouldn't expect anything less than great when it comes to its quality. Still, it doesn't make sense to buy movies 1-4 now and hope to buy a dvd box set of 5-7 later (or to buy movies 5-7 individually). The whole purpose of buying a box set is to save money right? Then, I suggest waiting (and renting) in the mean time."
5,best series,"harry is the best series, it is ashame that thereis not more harry to look forward to.i wish they couldve continued on just one more movie, it is sad not to be looking forward to another harry potter movie."
1,Very disappointed!!,"I wanted an inexpensive way to complete my Harry Potter collection. I already had the Deathly Hollows 1, the Order of the Phoenix and the Half-blood prince. I also had the Prisoner of Azkaban (with English only). I was looking for the Spanish versions of the films. Even though it states in the description that the Spoken Languages are English, French and Spanish, only one of them came with the Spanish soundtrack. Very disappointed indeed, as I wanted my kid to be able to watch these wonderful films. Oh, well, have to send it back!!"
2,Not worth the money,"Since I was in a hurry and did not read the description of this purchase I paid $3.95 for what I thought to be a book. This is a pamplet.It really does not ""show"" you how to build composters with verbal descriptions instead of detail diagrams."
3,good introduction to composting,This is a good little book for a decent price to see if you are really interested in composting. It does show some various designs to build composters and what you can put into the composter. I built mine out of pallets and it is working fine with really no investment but my time.
4,Nice guide to getting started with composting,"Nice little guide. Worth the small price to get some good ideas. With encouragement from this book, I started a compost pile after a long time of just thinking about it."
4,Short Read lots of ideas,"This book is a good source if you are composting or vermicomposting. Whether outside or indoors, there are plenty of designs to choose from, or even combine to make your own"
2,A little dissapointed,"I've just finished Jordan's Cove and can only say is was an okay read. This 178 page novel left me with a lot of unanswered questions. One being why Lucy (main character) could not use her gift to keep her out of some of the situations she found her self in?I was really hoping for more, but in the end I was a little disappointed."
4,My Sharp VC-H813U is a quality low-cost HI-Fi VCR,"It has four autocleaning, 19 micron heads. The picture quality can be enhanced with a sharpen picture button on the face. The sound is clear (90 dBs). It offers playback of SVHS in quasimode (not SVHS quality) and has automatic time set from TV stations. It has 400x speed rewind, noisy but quick. I thought the auto set-up could be better, but you only have to do it once. Still frame was usually clear. The remote is color coded and can be programmed to operate most TVs, Cable boxes/Satellite Receivers. If you loose the remote most operation buttons, including menu are on the front of the VCR. It offers Index search, one button skip search and instant replay on tapes. Finally, it has a tamper proof setting for those with children."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this with the idea to stick it on the side of the regular garbage can I use for diapers. The can does not have a lid. First the sticky tape is, well, NOT STICKY. That's good it you want to remove it without leaving gunk to clean off however, it doesn't stay stuck for even an hour.Also the scent is only realized if you have your nose stuck to the packet. It may very well last for 6 months but it isn't going to be very strong at all. In fact I had to purposely sniff it out to even notice it was there. The packet does have a satisfaction guarentee for a replacement if the one you get doesn't smell. However I decided not to redeem the guarentee because and even greatly improved product still isn't going to do too much."
2,Didn't last,Still looking for something to help keep the kitchen trash can from smelling before I fill it up. Stuck it to the inside of the hinged lid. This product only lasted for about a month and a half. Did not work as claimed.
5,Promoting Principal/Teacher Trust,"I found the excerpts of your book on the website, down to earth,using common sense when working with a staff,to foster communication, shared respect and learning ""the ART of listening""...you expressed the painful but necessary lesson for growth, about moving from teacher to principal and how this seperated you from your staff ...You convey that it can be lonely during the transition,as you learned that you cannot be a good manager and a best friend too....You share the message, to be a great manager and principal, you must learn to step back, see the whole picture,be a good listener ,think about the ideas being shared, take the good parts ,fix the bad parts and blow the rest to the winds...You share,to be a success, you do what you must as a principal,to open communications,while fostering mutual respect with your staff, so as a team ,you can meet the challenges of educating our children.. """
3,Photos on the site are NOT of what I received,I liked the photos and the price - so I bought a set. But what I got is drastically different from photos. Shape of handles is completely different (received slim almost tipped handles versus wide and rounded handle ends shown in photos) . What I received is OK (especially for the money) but I'm disappointed that it's NOT what is depicted on the product page (even though product name and item number are the same).
2,beware...,"flatware was exactly what I wanted as far as weight and design (LOVE the shape of the spoons). Unfortunately, one of the teaspoons is from an entirely different design! Also, the packaging was bizarre (torn pcs of cardboard and rubber bands around the sets of pcs). Do NOT buy as a gift unless you plan on repackaging. I'm not sure why I had a ""stray"" teaspoon in there...will be okay if I have only SEVEN people dining!"
3,"good price, wierd shaped spoons","I only paid $13 for this set, which is a great deal. However, the spoons are shaped differently than normal spoons."
4,Fairly Decent,This flatware set is nice and decent and serves both the purpose of cooking and serving together.
3,Same experience: not the item pictured,"The flatware I received is lightweight, reasonably well manufactured for the price (I might dock a star off 5 for the table knife serrations), and the finish is quite nice. If they were shaped like the pictures, I would probably give them a 5 for the price.However, the aesthetics and ergonomics of the design I received not only do not match the pictures, they are just plain ugly. Narrow tapered handles on all, forks with ridiculously tapered and stunted tines, and awkward bowl shaped spoons. Design gets 2 stars. Split the difference for 3. Considered long and hard about sending back, but ultimately decided that for twenty bucks, they are essentially disposable: When a great deal on a set I like comes out, I can just throw or give these away, and in the meantime, they really aren't that bad, just not my style."
1,Be careful giving this as a gift,"I purchased this flatware as a shower gift. Be aware that it comes in an ugly beat up brown box and all the silver ware is rubber banded together. The silverware is OK - not so ""shiny"" as another reviewer put it - but OK for everyday flatware. I wish Amazon would list that it does not come in a decent box. I would not have purchased it if I had known that."
5,Very satisfied,"Very fast delivery, item was in the condition described. I would buy again from this seller."
3,Sex and the City,"The reason I didn't give a higher rating is because there is no ""play all"" selection. It stops after each episode which is very annoying."
5,awesome,I am a huge fan of Sex and the city! I ordered season two and it was sent to me in a timely manor and in great condition!!
5,The Only Soap For Babies,"It will be a sad day when we have to move on to a different soap for our 1 yr old. It smells wonderful, rinses clean, and doesn't irritate the little guy's eyes. Maybe we won't ever move on..."
1,***WARNING*** about pHisoderm...,"I have read that pHisoderm contains 3% hexachlorophene.The literature states that hexachlorophene is not recommended for infants and nursing women because it is a teratogen (i.e., could cause developmental problems.) Further, it could cause cancer. Look up the chemical for yourself. Both pHisoderm and pHisohex were banned in the '70s when anything with greater than 1% hexachlorophene was considered dangerous. pHisoderm was brought back in the '80s.Look up the details of hexachlorophene yourself and make your own decision."
5,love this show!,man this is my third favorite box set at the time and I love Asuma with his chakra blades they are really cool and this a great show that anybody will love.

5,this story willl make you cry and laugh,This book tells of a young child who survived terrible neglect. Most dont realize neglect comes in all forms. This book will have you crying with the author and then happy that she has survived!!! I recommed this book to everyone. This book will open your heart.I hope you enjoy as much as I.
3,"Girls Think of Everything Gets a ""C""","The cover illustration promised a whole lot more than was offered inside. The individual stories were factual and little else. Couldn't they have had more liveliness that would equal the cover? My search was for books about girls/women who make a difference in history and modern times, and this was accomplished but with little ""pizzazz""."
