4,Pretty Good,"This is a good book because it shows that Han and Leia's relationship is not perfect. They have their own problems too. I think it is kind of unrealistic as well, I mean, would Leia really dump Han that quickly? Anyway, Prince Isolder is from the Hapes cluster and is trying to marry Leia. In a last ditch attempt to keep this from happening, Han steals Leia and takes her to the planet Dathomir. Luke and Isolder team up to find them. I think that if you're looking for a good book o sit down and read, that this would work."
5,A GREAT ACTION PACKED BOOK,"In The Courtship of Princess Leia there were many more Force sensitive ""witches"" that try to destroy Luke Skywalker and his friends. Then they meet the other group of force strong people that want to help destroy the ""withches"". Leia is in a deep struggle of what to do with her life. I very handsome prince from a ring of planets has asked to marry her. If she does the system will join the Rebel Allience, if she doesn't they won't.The Courtshipp of Princess Leia is a great book for all audiences."
5,Great Book!,"I have read this book more times then I can remember. It tells you how Han and Leia really decided to get married. It takes about 4 years after Return of the Jedi. Dave Wolverton is a very talented author, which is shown in this book."
2,"Uh, can I have a refund","Get this book from the library only if you are really bored. I liked the Leia/Han sparring and relationship in the movies. I like stories that focus on characters. This book failed to hold my interest because Leia, Luke, and Han were out of character. Luke's and Han's friendship was ignored and Leia came across as shallow. I never believed that Leia actually cared about Mr. Boring Prince or that Han would behave in such a childish fashion. Luke's actions towards the Force Witches did not make sense. There are much better SW books out there."
5,You know it's good when people LOVE or HATE it!,"This book is paced just like the SW movies, with plenty of action and humor. Wolverton really seems to understand the characters we all know and love, and makes newly introduced characters believable and interesting. Excellent insights into almost every aspect of the SW universe."
5,Best book of the Star Wars novels by far,"An exiting and romantic novel-a must read for Star Wars fans. Princess Leia must choose between Han Solo and a wealthy prince who brings with him the promise of powerful alies. Meanwhile Luke Skywalker must discover the deadly secrets of the ship The Eye of Palpatine before its too late. A masterpiece of action, suspence, romance, and mystery."
4,A good book but...,"This is a good book. I do have some problems with it though.There must be hundreds of force strong people liveing on Dathomir. Why dont we hear about them before hand?At the end of the book, Luke finds all those records. They were never mentioned again. Why?Leia is NOT the kind of person who goes running away from the person she loves because her knight in shinig armor comes along. She never would have dumped Han because Isolder came along.Aside from those things, the book is excellent. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes Star Wars."
5,A hot Star Wars novel,"Han fights for Leia's love in an interesting Star Wars novel. Dathomir is a planet with witches, not Jedi's. It's a very good book, read it."
4,It was okay - I did like it!,"Well, it's a good book, I'll give it that. It doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the Star Wars universe, but it's an important part of the story. It has some great characters, especially the witches of Dathomir. I like the idea of 'King Solo' and the other ridiculous things that seem to be going right, then wind up to be going wrong. All in all, it could be better, but then, it could also be a LOT worse!"
5,a totally awsome book,I once said that i would never read a star wars book unless george lucas wrote it. but a friend reccomended this one to me and i absolutely loved it. this book is so good you cant stop reading it and when your through you want to read more!
3,Been Better Been Worse,"The reason This book did not get 5 stars was the HORRIABLE protrayal of Luke(My fav SW character) He loses faith in his abilities, get beaten by a ol hag and is doing this with no emotion AND is late for Han and Leia's wedding! The only cool Jedi ish thing he did was fly the flacon better than Han and Chewie put together! But he is an AWSOME pilot already(a point most authors ignore grrr..) But on the up side the Han-Leia thing was real sweet. And the tame rancors were really really COOL!"
1,WHAT?!?!?,"After destroying two Death Stars together... after spending months searching for Han's carbonite corpse... after risking life and limb to rescue him from Jabba the Hutt... after confessing their love under GUNFIRE on Endor...Princess Leia turns around and jumps into the arms of the first interplanetary prince to come along, just because he has a fleet that might be usefull to the Rebellion? Puh-LEEZE!Not only was the premise not plausible, it wasn't even well written. The characterization was nothing short of inaccurate (Han Solo gambles away the Falcon to win a planet for Leia... right!) and the storyline was fragmentary and elusive.And the worst part was the ending. I'll leave it to you to discover, but don't expect a thrill or even logic. I'm not into corny in my Star Wars books. Stick with Timothy Zahn."
1,The boks was a gross disapointment,"First off, what the author was trying to do while writing this book is unknown to me, but he managed to break time lines and protray the characters so horribly I'm suprised Lucas Film let him get away with it. 'King' Solo? 'Cuse me, in the Han Solo Trilogy it clearly mentions Han did made a through search for his ancestery and could find nothing except a possible great aunt, the change in his last name the auothor mentions is impossible, Han did know his own last name until the Wookie who cared for him on the Trader's Luck told him in was 'Solo'. Leia, in all her princess ways, would never have been so 'difficult'. 8 years with Han wouldn't be thrown aside after 2 minutes by Isolder. I wont even go into how appauled about how the author chose to protray Luke, cause it might just never end but let me just say this one thing. Atleast he could play Artoo right! (that was sarcasm if you missed it)I'll give the book one star, cause I liked the cover art. Thank you =)"
5,"Very Good, A little weird, but hey, its science fiction!","This is probably up there with my favorite SW books. It's funny too. At first I thought Dave Wolverton was really insane, but now I realize the guy's a genious!!!!! I thought Luke was portrayed very, very well. He is probably my favorite character and some writers make him too stiff or serious. I mean he needs to have some fun too. The scene where he is talking with Isolder and his mother is a very funny one as well. Dathomir is awsome and the witches are way cool.One thing I didn't like so much was how Leia totally dropped Han Another problem I had with this book was that Han was so desperate. He has always been so cool and collected but going and kidnaping Leia and draging her off seems a little extereme.The last thing I have to say is thai book filled in something the movies and the Zahn books left open. That is when were Leia and Han married? Well read on!!!!!!(oh yeah, Recomended for everyone)MTFBWY'all"
3,Silly plotline,"I liked this book, don't get me wrong, but the plotline was truly silly. Even Han is not dumb enough to do some of the things he supposedly did in this book. I feel it was rather insulting to his character. I have read all the Star Wars books, and like all series, some books are better than others. It is enjoyable, but IMHO it's just not as great as some of the other reviewers say, and it's certainly not as bad as the first reviewer made it seem"
1,Can you say junk?,"This is the worst Star Wars book I have read. If anybody wants to read this don't spend the money, get it from a library. The charactrers don't even act like themselves. Please, can you see Leia marrying another guy after she and Han connected in ESB and ROTJ? I don't. The author obviously didn't do his research on Star Wars. The only redeeming quality of this book is it created the Wraith Squadron books for X-Wing. At least Wolverton made one good character, that being Zsinj. Also can you imagine the Falcon destroying a Super Star Destroyer."
5,The Best Star Wars novel thus far,"The Courtship of Princess Leia is a great adventure story, but not much romance if that's what you're looking for. The characters are well-developed, and the entrance of new characters and the planet Dathomir will continue to be the subject of Star Wars fiction for a long time. If you want to know the true story of how Princess Leia and Han Solo got married, read this!"
1,"Not worthy of the name ""Star Wars""","I was reading through the other reviews of this book, and I was amazed to see how many people gave it high ratings. This book completely lacked the Star Wars magic and the well-written style of some other books. First of all, the references to witches was a little strange. Aren't we in the Star Wars universe here? Did they even HAVE witches? Another thing I didn't like was the competition between Han and Isolder. Han and Leia have a solid relationship at the end of RotJ, and Han is jealous of some over-bulked, non-intelligent prince? And furthermore, so jealous that he knocks out Leia and kidnaps her? Totally un-Star-Wars-like. I have read many, many books since this one and have found none that I liked less."
2,What a bad book!,"Wow, I thought this was by far one of the worst Star Wars books ever written. First of all it lacked the magic that the movies had. I mean at the end of the book I was just kind of filled with an empty feeling. Second it was a little on the gory side which isn't like Star Wars at all. All in all this was a bad book."
3,A difficult read,"I give this a five because it was a Star Wars book. It was hard to follow, because the author writes in long drawn out sentences. I agree with the last guy, Han is a disappointment in this book and completely out of character (a wuss). If you can live without knowing how they got together, skip it and go on. I would like to see this book rewritten with the original snotty princess and the greedy space pilot."
4,Better than most of the single Star Wars books!,"This book is better than most of the other single released books like Truce at Bakura or Crystal Star. The scene is laid about 2-3 years after Return of the Jedi. Han and Leia find themselves unsure of marriage, which is the entry point for the Prince of Hapes, who is prince of over seventy planets, wants to court Leia and will join the alliance on the pretext only. Feeling threatened by this man, Han kidnaps Leia to the planet Dathomir, which he won in a game of sabaac. The Prince and Skywalker follow him to the planet, where it is discovered that jedi live. There is a war taking place between the Light and the Darkside in which the characters become wrapped up in. It isa very enjoyable book"
2,This one's a little painful,"Yep. I read it. It hurt, by I survived. It's set a couple of years after Return of the Jedi (4?). It has a very bizzare plot, of Leia being suited and the like. Han Kidnapps her, and somehow they wind up on this 'uninhabited' world. That is, except for political prisoners, witches, and oh, yes Rancors.WHY!!!!Zjinsi learns of this, brings his SSD around to the system and they have a good 'ol battle. It had its moments, not many, but it had them. (allow me the paraphrasing of a certain character, please)I'd say for the die-hard star wars fan, you almost have to read it, but anyone else might resort to violence after being subjected to the tyranny of the first several chapters. Happy Reading P-)"
2,Here it goes...,"I read the Heir to the Empire before I read The Courtship of Princess Leia and let me tell you after reading Zahn's books you'll think every other Star Wars book can't compare. Courtship does not stay true to the Star Wars characters. Han Solo was cr4eated into a starved for love child, Leia- way too stubborn for her own good. And what was with Luke floating down in air? He may become powerful but he isn't yet. The Prince Isolder was a bit too ego manic for me. The only character a slightly liked was The Queen Mother, she was bitchy, in a good way. I did like that Luke had something of a love interest. Those witches and the Nightsisters, what was up with them? I just think that if you want to read this book, read it before you read Zahn's trilogy, because this one wasn't half as good."
4,What if...,"...Prince Isolder of Hapes was successful in his courtship of Leia? And then Han Solo and Teneneil Djo of Dathomir caught each other on the rebound? Would they as a couple be known as ""The Captain and Teneniel?"""
4,"Good unit, but no rain sensor connection","Nice small controller,with remote. Easy to program but you can't wire a rain sensor to it. It has a manual rain over ride switch but who wants to have to do this manually every time it rains."
5,Time Saver!,"I had the Orbit Super-6 Controller w/remote installed in my house in Las Vegas for over ten years and when I moved to Boise I installed one in my new home, that was seven years ago for a total use of 17 years. I have given about six of them to friends and neighbors who liked the connivence very much. No more yelling back to someone to turn off a water circuit. You have the controls right in our hand. Ya Gotta Love It. It is easy to instal and program."
4,Works great,"I bought this to replace the same unit that gave out on me when my house was hit with lightning. I love the remote feature because if I'm working in the backyard and want the sprinklers on, I can turn them on without leaving the backyard with the remote. It's automated, so once you set it, you don't have to worry about when your sprinklers come on. Great product."
5,Decent controller,"Five stars because it did exactly as the product stated which was exactly what I needed. Replaced an old junky controller with this and have much better control over my system. The remote is a total bonus for this at this price range. In fact, being able to get my boy with the sprinklers, or my dog, better yet my wife... So much from from my couch. Also an easy setup."
1,Dead in 6 months,"The remote control is a great idea but, The working range is not good enough.First time I installed the timer in basement above ground and concrete line, It worked only when I hold the remote few feet away from basement window.I then installed the timer in garage 6 feet above first floor, so I have about 60 feet any where around house. In this way, the cable from timer to valve is much longer and drilling through walls must be doneUpdate,It's dead in about 6 months. At first, stays on for 1 second then goes off. Later, turns on without command, Finally don't response at all. The star is now down to 1 from 4."
2,Avoid - A highly deceptive product,"1. Although advertised as and ""indoor"" controller, it is impossible to hide the wires and the hole in the wall for the wires. It's fine to mount in a garage, but not in the house.2. There is an 8-inch antenna wire the protrudes from the top of the unit. This has been cut off in the marketing photos and in the photo on the box. It's completely ugly and they didn't bother to spend 10-cents to cover it with something more attractive. It's just a bare black wire sticking up in the air.3. The remote control works on a line of sight basis. It does not do well through walls. It warns you about this in the instruction manual. That's not my definition of ""remote control"" for something that you will be using outside when it has to be mounted inside.4. The color of this thing is god-awful."
2,"The timer itself is good, but if you blow a fuse it's worthless...","The timer took a bit more setup than another time I was used to and the installation of the wires required them to be screwed in instead of flipping a tab. Neither of these are significant issues. The remote worked well and was nice to have since our controls are in the basement. However, we had a bad selenoid that blew the fuse and there is only one spare. When we tried to find a replacement for the fuse, no one sells it. Not Menards, Lowe's, Home Depot, the local hardware store or Amazon. We have one bad zone and we're afraid to try to fix it because we can still water the other 5 zones with the spare fuse. If we think we fixed the selenoid and we're wrong, our timer is now defunct due to blowing the spare fuse. Save yourself the hassle and buy a timer with a fuse you can replace!"
2,LCD Panel Goes Dead after two years,"I purchased an Orbit Sprinkler Control Box, Model 57096, about two years ago, and it has slowly and gradually malfunctioned one zone after the next (this is a six-zone model). I have indeed checked the fuse, changed the batteries, and the LCD panel is completely blank and, for all practical purposes, the unit is now worthless. It will be the last time I buy this brand."
3,Somewhat disapointed,"I bought the book to read to my grand-daughter as I remember reading the book in my childhood, but the book I remember was a story about how Chessie wandered aboard a train and the rest of the book was about how the porters and conductors concealed the little kitty from authorities on the railroad. The book from Amazon was more of a history of the image of the kitten as the mascot of the Chesapeake railroad, which was quite interesting in itself, but not what I had hoped for......"
4,Mike shines except for fragil lapel/tie clip,We use the mikes for televised trustee's meeting in a adult community. They work very well but....the member's of the board continue to break the plastic lapel/tie clip. We would like to purchase a box full of the clips. ...
4,Decent,I only ever read Dazzle from ths offer. It is nt generally my type of novel. It's okay for it's type. Was enjoyable
3,"Amusing in the beginning, boring in the end...","At first, I really liked Eve. She was such a wild character. Then it got boring really quick, and even though the author tried to make both Dalphine and Freddy exciting and adventurous, it was obvious that they were just dull and boring characters."
2,Not what I ordered.,The item I ordered is a Shreddershark. I received a brand called TECHKO. I checked reviews of what I orderd from other sources and ordered it. I got some other brand which I know nothing about!!!. I will try to use it but it really sucks when a company advertises a product in detail and sends you a different Brand. That reflects bad on Amazon!!!
4,Works good but I don't think it can really handle 8 sheets.,Shreads Credit cards and CDs too. I think 8 sheets at a time is bit much though. Still a good machine for the money.
5,Love it!,"Works well and usually doesn't get stuff stuck. Very easy to fix if it does. Quick tip: put a trash bag in the bin for easier clean-up, it doesn't interfere with anything."
3,shredder review,Arrived on time and worked great. Just like with all shredders this one shouldnt be used according to the maximum allowable sheets of paper. It handles five pretty well. The paper bin is a little bit on the small side and is a little messy to clean because the paper gets caught in the rollers and you have to remove it by hand. The manual says not to run staples or labels through it and that is a pain because most mail comes with some form of label but i have been running labels through it and it seems to be doing fine after a month of daily use. Just use a little more shredder oil than usual. Pretty good unit overall for the price.
3,"Like getting a big box with a tiny trophy,","Sacha Nairobi, has a beautiful voice, and several of the songs on this CD are amazing, for instance Princesa or ""Oye Los Tambores"" but I think most of the tracks do a poor job at letting Sacha showcase her voice. It's an enjoyable CD, but it could be SO much better!"
5,What A Great Album !!!,"I got this album a couple of days ago and I can't stop listening to it. Every song is a hit. She has it all!!: great lyrics, great sound and on top of that, she is so pretty...."
3,Trying too Hard,"Alaska is the main interest to me in this book. Don Porter sounds like a real nice guy, but I don't think he is a smooth writer.I'm sure he did a lot of research, and had a lot of information about planes, and how important they are to this state.I'm glad I read this book, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone not familiar with Alaska"
5,No need to be 'Humble',"Following on the heels of last years' melody-filled 'Learning Curves'. Einstein's Sister has reached in the cookie jar to extract another handful of tasty tunes.The songwriting team of Bill Douglas and Kerry Tucker are only getting better - and they were already very good. The band is tighter, the harmonies brighter."
3,point worth noting...,"one pack of these pages will hold 200 cd's, but only 100 if you want to store the artwork/booklets. also, the product description states that the pages will fit ""any"" binder. while that isn't untrue, the pages extend quite a bit past the cover of a standard binder. just thought i'd point out these things so no one else is mildly disappointed with their purchase."
1,Incompatible with SDHC or 4GB CF cards though specs say otherwise,"I've had this card reader/hub for nearly a year. Until a month ago, it worked just fine. However, I've recently found that neither my 4GB Transcend SDHC card nor my 4GB Kingston 45X Elite Pro CF card is recognized. I wrote to i-Rocks to request replacement under warranty, and they tell me that I need to upgrade to a more recent card reader/hub. The more recent item (IR-8110) is not even listed on their website, and the specs for the IR-8000 clearly state that SDHC cards are supported.i-Rocks customer support refuses to acknowledge their error. This is the last time I'm going to buy one of their products."
4,Nice USB Hub / Card Reader,"First unit was defective, as could barely get USB cables in hub.New one seems fine. Nicely designed, seems fairly durable.Great to have one box for both card reader and USB hub."
5,Reality Frights,"I have read most of the writers other books as well as this, and let me say that she adds such reality to her books. Each story is written from actual accounts from the people that have had the experiences, or have been researched to the validity of the story. She tells it with such clarity that you can almost see the images. You can feel the hair on the back of your neck start to perk up. But just when you're feeling your nerves at the end of one story she throws a light little comment at you to calm you enough to get ready for the next story. This truly is wonderfully written you'll enjoy every minute of it"
3,Very Enjoyable--Worth the Price,The stories in this books are easy to read and enjoyable. I recommend buying this book if you live in the Central PA area (or not). [...] Keep the great books coming though.
2,true ghost stories of lancaster county,"i read the previous reviews, got the book, etc. I'd call this 'light true ...."".. There are few 'real' ghost stories, and unnecessary time was spent on questionable parts, like Three Mile Island. At sixty some pages, I wondered, is this all? The places are bewildering to out siders like me but the map helps. Author has a light style and makes easy reading. There are far better ghost books out there, search! Even if they aren't under 7 bucks."
1,Wake me when it's over,"I came to this novel expecting the kind of howlers that made When the Road Bottoms Out a classic of ineptitude. But this is just a snoozy, by-the-numbers five-finger exercise in transgression. The chapters, though, are mercifully short."
1,Forgetable,"If you're a mother perhaps you'll like this. But does that mnake it great literature? I read this because a friend suggested it; what I didn't know though is that really its audience is meast only to be that tiny Oprah/Rosie crowd that only want to read books within their own tiny worldviews. I couldn't fit myself into this story, couldn't figure out why I should care. The writing at times is not only bad it's downright sloppy, so that didn't help either. I didn't like this book, sorry."
5,Captivating Read,"From page one the reader is captivated. The story of a young woman obsessed with her young son is totally believable and bizarre at the same time. She creates an insular exciting and nurturing world for her son (a ""duprass"" as Kurt Vonnegut might call it) and repels all those who try to enter or interfere with that world. As her son grows older and wants to interact with the outside world, the mother becomes more possessive and possessed. A truly fascinating study."
3,A bit expensive for the quality,"I love the look of this rattan storage tower, but upon opening it, I discovered that the insides of the drawers are rather flimsy (a paperboard-like wood for drawer bottoms). Also, the back of the tower is really ugly, so it really has to go against a wall.The price isn't terribly high, but still I'd expect a lower price given the relatively small number of DVDs/Videos it can hold and the flimsy drawer bottoms. When you pull out the drawers, they are not on a track and easily fall out.All in all though, it's pretty nice and looks great - holds a small lamp on top."
3,GOOD,this product is satisfactory. It accesorizes my room nicely. It is neat and organized. i just wish it could hold more than 50 DVDs and that the drawers would glide open easier so that i wouldnt have to take the drawers out in order to get the dvds.
3,Rattan CD/DVD Rack,"I am considering returning this product for 2 reasons. 1st, I have 2 toddlers who are constantly turning it over. 2nd, the rack is very attractive with the exception of the sides of the drawers which show through on each side of the mission style strips..the drawers are made of a light weight wood but look similar to cardboard on the sides. Other wise, it is a very good looking piece for the price. I would like to know what other consumers think of it. For the price, it may be worth keeping and dealing with the sides somehow."
3,"I love it, but it's shoddy","We love this DVD tower, but we have only had is a few months, and several of the drawers are broken. First the back of them came off, and second, the bottom (the acutal drawer part) did! Also, it is a bit dented. Now, to be fair, my children use it to keep their DVD's in as well, so that may be part of the problem, but come on! 3 months?"
1,Mine broke,"May just be me but the plastic near the port to hook into the iPod, broke and caused everything to be Black and White. Great product when it worked however."
2,Good for Audio but not TV,"I recommend you buy your cable from PocketFish. At least you won't be disapointed with fact it will not work with your Classic Series IPOD.It also works with the newest 120GB Classic. I gave it two stars because the audio works.Bill StricklandGainesville, GA"
3,"OK, but there are better options for less","This is an OK way to go. I went this way because of the S-Video connection thinking that would improve the overall picture quality. It did not. Also the sound through the unit is very muffeled so you have to turn your TV volume way up to hear what is going on in the movie. I also bought a plug in adapter for $10 that just uses the standard Red, White, and Yellow connectors, and it works just as good."
5,Works great!,"Plugged my Ipod video for the first time to my TV yesterday - works great! I have an old TV with a coax connected to my even older VCR. Used the Monster ITV Link to connect the Ipod (via the dock connector) to a Line-in on the VCR. Used the supplied S-Video to Composite Video adapter, adjusted the Video Settings on the Ipod to TV Out - we have picture and sound on the TV! Depending on the quality of the video, the picture can be a little grainy - but I think that has more to do with the quality of the video than the cable. The ITV Link also has a mini USB port on it, so you can charge the Ipod while watching - avoid the Ipod from dying on you in the middle of a movie. So I have the ITV Link hooked to the USB Power Adapter via a USB to mini B cable.There may seem to be a lot of cables and adapters involved - but it really isn't hard to hook-up. Just add these to the already growing mass of wires and cables behind your home entertainment center."
1,Doesn't work...,"...With the new ipod classic. Apple got entirely too greedy and started putting authentication chips in their cables and docs. The tv-out will only work if the chip is detected. The cable may be fine on older ipods, so disregard the 1 star rating."
1,Does NOT work with IPOD Classic,"I have an IPOD Classic 160GB. I plugged this into the plasma and the sound worked beautifully. When I switched the setting on the IPOD to TV out, the sound quit and the IPOD kept asking for TV Accessory."
1,"Classic ipod, Apple","Don't buy this Monster ipod cable for use with a classic ipodI own the 160 gig unit and this cable won't work for av output, soI had to go the the apple store, and bought the apple cord. Works great!the store told me that the new classis ipod has a chip built into the cordthat lets the video signial work. 50 bucks was the cost"
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH NEWER IPODS,"Apple changed the video out from composite to component with its newer iPods. This cable will not work with the component feeds. Monster told me that they are coming out with one that will; however, it will be a couple of months. I have an iPod Classic. It does not work with this model."
2,Not compatable with 3g Nano,The quality of the cable itself is fine however I bought this cable because it listed as working with the Nano. After receiving it and was unable to get the Video to work. I called apple and they stated that this cable will not work with the 3G Nano's that I have. I wish the product had a more specific list to what it will and will not work with. I was going out of town and didn't have time now to order online again so I stopped at a Apple store and bought there cable for $50 and it works fine. Now I'm back home past the 30 day return policy and have a useless cable here.
1,Not iPod Compatible,"These cables are not compatible with the iPod Classic 80G model. I tried Monster for help, but they did not reply. Neither Amazon nor Monster note this compatibility problem. Shame on them. See the other reviews saying the same thing before you buy."
2,"Looks nice, thick wire, but doesn't work.","Great for audio, but no video. Again, NO VIDEO and that is why I bought it. Very Dissapointed.There are other cables/devices that allow you to control the Ipod with a remote control."
1,Flabbergasted and Frustrated!!!,"I do not know whether to blame Amazon and Monster for not clarifying that this product does not work with the latest iPod Classic product or Apple for changing the interface. Ultimately, I blame myself for not reading the reviews for this product prior to ordering else I would have known that despite the product's claim, this product does not work with the newer iPod Classics. I have had such good performance out of Monster products that I did not think twice about ordering after reading the product description which did not mention that the iTV Link does not work with new iPods. I will be wary of Monster products in the future and thoroughly research prior to purchasing if I purchase a Monster product."
4,Worked just fine... but don't forget...,"Ok, just a few things.1. The video looks fine (I have a 28"" HD FP and the quality is somewhere between TV and DVD quality), make sure resolution of movie file your playing isn't too low for a big screen TV. My original batch of movies I loaded up were at the lowest, and they looked like I was playing old VHS tapes.2. I highly recommend you get the charger adapter. Once you load your iPod up with your movie files your only going to get 3-4 hours of video before it tuckers out. It would have been nice if the charger just came with it... this is one of the pricier cables anyway.Overall, I'd say the product is worth it, and I would recommend it."
2,Too good to be true,"I ordered this product with great expectations, only to be let down. This cable is still sitting in the box for a week now because I tryed for about 2-3 hours to get it to work. There is no phone number for assistance so your on your own. I was really excited to see my I-pod on tv but that didn't happen. Other reviews said just plug it in. Not the case with me. I might be doing something wrong but I have hooked up many electronic devices in my time and I tryed everything from the line-in, line 1 and 2,the tv out switch and settings on ipod, even hooking it up through the vcr audio/video. I tryed other tv sets, switching the plugs around, etc. I don't know what it is. I am going to give the wire one last try this week then I am sending it back. After all was said and done between the next day shipping and upgraded wire this product cost more then I wanted to spend and more time then I wanted to take to hook it up. If I do get it to work it may be worth it."
4,Good Stuff.....,So far so good!! I was a little scared buying this product after I read many reviews that mentioned this just broke off in a few uses. Monster has this habit of making things unnecessarily big and fat. This is definitely expensive for what it does. Hope somebody else comes out with a new cable that could fool iPod Classic's TV out and enable it. And make price it at $20.
1,It very fragile. Mine broke on day 1.,"The seller was great and it shipped fast. However, when I got home and tried to plug my Ipod into my TV input, the video never came up. When I looked at the product, the male end of the S-Video cable output had already broken. I eventually bought a different brand from a local store and it works fine. I do not recommend this product."
1,WARNING_ THIS DOESN'T WORK WITH IPOD CLASSIC 160gb!!!!!!!!,WARNING_ THIS DOESN'T WORK WITH IPOD CLASSIC 160gb!!!!!!!! ApparentlyApple has made it so that only the apple brand connector will output to the TV (it has some chip in it) I though I was being smart buying the monster one but IT WON'T WORK and now I have to mail it back on my dime and my hassle and my- no ipod on the tv!
1,Does not work with new iPod Video Nano,You should know that this device will not work with the new iPod Nano. Even if you set the TV out to ON under video settings it will not work. Try setting it to ASK instead of ON and it still will not work. The product description says nothing about it not working with the new iPods so save yourself the trouble and skip buying this item unless you have one of the older video iPods. Amazon really ought to update the product description otherwise they are going to be settling a lot of A-to-Z claims.
2,Nice if it worked.,"Not sure if it's nice or not. Having trouble outputting video from the Ipod Classic. Heard an array of issues stemming from accessories needing an apple compatible chip to the player software itself causing the issue. The cable looks nice - and I think Monster has nice products, just that they are over price for what they are. So this review probably isn't much help, but thought you ought to make sure what version you have a do a little reading before you purchase."
1,ITV Link For I-POD,"Video Doe's not work with Touch I-POD, Auido Works Great on Stereo.Monster AI ITV IP-10 iTV Link for iPod (10 ft.)o."
1,monster AI ITV IP-10iTV link for ipod,"It's not work correctly for the ipod. All you receive is the sound , there is no picture or video display , at all."
1,It is dirt cheap for a reason...,"Did not work with my Ipod Nano (previous generation) or my iPhone 3G when it came to video - which is the primary reason I tried this cable.Unless you have a prehistoric iPod - all the new iPhone, iPod, etc. from Apple seems to be requiring special Apple chip embedded in the cable in order to allow video output. Pretty nasty of Apple. This cable does not seem to have that chip.Instant junk, this cable turned out to be for me. :("
2,not compatable,Really small on the back of the box it says it is only made for ipod video and photo ipod. So if you have a nano or anything else like me this will be useless for video. For my nano it will only play music which is not why i bought it. Hope this helped.
1,Bad product,Waste of 15 dollars... Video didnt come through at all. And yes i check all my Ipod settings and trouble shooted all the way through to find out it was the cable... Just pony up the 50 bucks and get the one apple makes... works perfectly and has a built in charger to keep the ipod going.
5,Stanley 91-928 1/4 inch drive pear head quick release ratchet,I own an auto repair shop. I bought this Stanley 1/4 ratchet to replace a lost one. The ratcheting teeth are a little tight but I know from experience it takes use to loosen a good ratchet. Sockets do not drop off this and the quick release works great. I've been using it for the last few months with no problems. Great ratchet.
3,Not exactly like the picture,"The description and what I got didn't exactly match up. However, the wrench does what I want it to do.The Amazon description said something about an 8 inch handle. Not sure how or where they measured that. It is somewhat shorter, but again, it does the job I want it to do."
5,good quality good price,Ratchet works well use it many many times daily good quality solid ratchet great price. I would recommend to anyone.
5,solid tool,For the price you can't go wrong. The tool doesn't drop sockets and the ratcheting works just fine. I use it for occasional jobs around the house and wrenching on the car. No complaints so far.
3,Maybe it's protecting?,"Maybe it's protecting the top coated leather from further wear, but do not expect improvement. Hard for me to tell, because once this stuff starts to get cracks or deep grooves/wrinkles, it pretty much stays that way. It hasn't cracked yet, so I hope it's continuing to protect, but it's really hard to tell if it's doing any good. I'll stay middle of the road until I can see it for a couple of years."
4,Quad Hoop Bumper,"The quad hoop bumper is strong, stylish, and easy to mount. Having a receiver on the front of my vehicle is a great feature to mount a bicycle rack or any other type of equipment that uses the receiver as an attachment point. It allows me to have access to the tail gate without having to take all the bikes off the vehicle. The ability to install four lights and a winch is a good feature as well. I am very satisfied with it."
4,be careful if you have kids!,"for the price its a great cart,its taller then I expected. took me maybe 30 minutes to assemble but I had to redo some of it.I'm worried about my 3 year old knocking into it and knocking off the microwave,ours just fits on the butcher block and it seems top heavy compared to my old cart."
4,This cart is worth it!,this cart does its job perfectly. when put together correctly this thing holds 44 pounds on two of the shelves and 33 pounds on the pull out shelf. thought it doesnt pull out far that was an added bonus when i opened it up. this cart is in the 50 dollar price range so yea it feels a little shakey when you move it but its deffinitly sturdy. we love this cart it work perfectly for our microwave and toaster oven. built well and does what its suppose to do. you get what you pay for and this cart is a little shakey but if u want solid buy a much more expensive wood cart. this cart saved us money and does what it is meant to do. ignore the bad reviews buy this but make sure you put it together correctly!
1,"Wobbles--easy to put up, easy to come DOWN.","This sounded fabulous based on the previous reviews---should have known that something with 4 and 5 star reviews BUT with a number of 1 stars meant ""exercise caution"". I bought this as an aid to an elderly friend who cant carry things across the kitchen very well anymore. It went together fairly easily after I figured out that the shelves only went on one way (the fittings and plastic fasteners are barely cone shaped). However, despite use of a rubber mallet as recommended by a previous reviewer, i could not get the shelves down tight enough to stick.Every time we moved the cart (gently) further than two feet the legs would start wobbling and force the shelves up the legs and off their plastic fittings. Moving the shelves down closer to the wheels didn't help. The wobble was still enough to loosen the shelves and make the whole thing collapse. Metal screws or braces are needed if you really want this thing to be safe to move."
4,Great buy!,"I crossed my fingers when I purchased this cart because of the mixed reviews. Worse case scenario, I'd just return it. I'm pleased to say that I am quite satisfied with the cart. I find it very sturdy (the bottom shelf holds up to 44 lbs!). In assembling it, I initially put the bottom shelf on upside down (the lip should be toward the floor). This mistake made the cart very unsteady, but as soon as I turned it right side up, everything came together like a glove. It's a handsome piece with lots of storage space. I keep my crock pot, rice cooker, and blender on the bottom shelf to clear counter space. Keeping these 'heavy' items on the bottom shelf and locking the whells also steadies the unit so that it doesn't move when using the sliding adjustable-height top shelf. I'd recommend it. Hope you found this review helpful."
4,ALways check target first!,"I bought this cart for $65 at a department store. I couldn't believe it when I saw it here for [much less]. Mine doesn't even have the spoon/utensil rack!! Other than that, I'm really happy with this cart. I'm in a small apartment with very little counter space. This is just the right height to go next to my stove and provide workspace."
4,A Winner !!!,I bought both the chrome microwave cart and pantry cart<br />and I am elated. I am able to move them around for different<br />things and they sturdy.I too didnt necessarily buy them for their intended purpose but more for a space saver and I am so glad I did.
1,bad quality product,This cart is poorly made and not sturdy enough to hold a microwave. It is not worth the money. I have bought products from amazon.com for years and this is the first time I have given a product a negative review. I bought it despite reading a couple of negative reviews and now regret it. I set it up correctly exactly as specified in the directions and it constantly wobbles. one of the metal pieces of the stands is also broken. I cannot return it because it is too hard to take a part. Amazon should not be selling poor quality products like this
5,Cheaper at the store,I purchased this in black to use in the computer room. It was easy to assemble and adjust for my purposes.I went to the local Target Store and got it on sale for $5 less and did not have to pay for shipping.
5,Great buy,"It's a great cart, strong. I'm using it in my office for my printer, fax machine and TV, the center center shelve is great for the fax machine since is slide out. The hook for the utensils are great for all the cable from the appliances. Great buy."
1,Cheap junk!,One of the wheels fell apart the first week we had it (and it does not move in our house so I know we werent too rough with it)and the darn thing keep leaning to the right! I would return the item for another one but target will not take it back (even for store credit) because I unfortunatly trew out the box. Ugh! I would not buy this item again!
5,Excellent value,"Easy to put together, very sturdy,uncluttered the kitchen counter, looks very nice, has a slide out middle shelf, puts my microwave on the same level as my kitchen counter. I am very pleased with it."
1,Couldn't hold the nuker . . .,"I waited months for this cart to be in stock. I was sure it would be perfect. I assembled it myself, following all the instructions. It seemed wobbly, but I continually adjusted the casters and convinced myself that the joints were flexible. When the time came to put my precious microwave on top, I trusted the cart would hold -- WRONG. Twice I placed my nuker on top and saw the much lauded cart buckle under its weight and collapse sideways. The second time, the maple top actually broke off the cart. Forget it!"
2,Not Very Sturdy,"My husband and I put this on our registry because we were going to be living in a small apartment and needed the extra space. Friends of his mom bought it for us, and when we tried to put it together, the middle shelf broke. Also, the wooden top just kind of sits on there, it doesn't bolt in or anything. It doesn't have enough support on the bottom and the materials are not heavy duty, so I wouldn't recommend putting a microwave or anything else remotely heavy on it, but as extra storage for light items, it would be okay."
4,Price is right,"This item is good quality for the price. It was slim enough to fit into a small space but yet the top portion was a perfect size for my microwave. Love the fact it is on wheels and having a small kitchen the extra shelves definately help. Actually, the top shelf pulls out which iss super convenient as well."
1,chrome microwave cart,"After having to return one cart for a broken piece that holds one of the casters, I bought another. After putting it together it was a bit unsteady. I seated it firmly onto the black pieces that the shelf sits on. It seemed better. I placed the microwave, (a small one) on the cart but when I moved it, the shelfs popped off the black pieces causing the whole cart to almost collapse. I finally re-enforced it with, would you believe, duct tape. (I will securing it with hose clamps.) I could take it back but this is the type cart I want and could find none other like it. It will have to do but I feel it is a pretty poor piece of equipment. Pretty, but a piece of junk."
4,"great, with one flaw","What a fantastic value, really, for this price. It does have one flaw, however, that can be very serious. When you roll the cart, even carefully, the shelves can pop off of their plastic brackets and the entire cart collapses. This happens even if you put it together very carefully and secure the shelves as tightly as possible. It's tall enough that it can easily break your microwave when it falls apart. But for $30 just squeeze a couple of drops of superglue onto those brackets (or make a deal with yourself not to roll it around) and you've got a pretty nifty cart!"
5,Excellent!,"I just purchased this cart and so far I love it!! It went together in minutes and is sturdy. I saw this item in the store initially and was a bit concerned about the quality at first...so as usual I came home and jumped on the website to see how you all rated it! Since everyone had such great comments, I went back and purchased it. I honestly would have expected to spend much more money for this product!! I'm now considering the bakers rack since I have the perfect spot for it and not much counter space."
4,Very nice and functional,"This product looks great and is VERY functional. I was able to put it together fairly easily, the install directions are good, just makes sure when you put the racks you don't put them on upside down. Table looks more expensive than it is, and it is very sturdy, no wobbling at all doing basic cooking prep work."
2,Not what I expected...,"We had vacationed in Key West Florida about 10 years ago and I was excited to get this puzzle and put it together. While it did bring back memories of the trip, most of Key West's landmarks are not included (or at least are not as prominent as they should be). We spent 3 days in Key West (2 nights) and the only place we visited that is on the map is the motel we stayed in.As far as the quality of the puzzle itself, many of the pieces were not cut properly and thus the backing ripped and the pieces separated when we went to put it together.From someone what has owned several dozen White Mountain puzzles, this one is not even close to the quality that we've come to expect, in design or in workmanship, from White Mountain Puzzles. I will be thinking long and hard before buying another White Mountain Puzzle."
5,Instrumental,"As a girl of eleven, this book was instrumental in helping me understand much of what was neccessary for living the Christian life. I highly reccomend it to any new young convert.My only qualm is that, whether it simply wasn't in the book or I missed it at my age, I did come away with far more desire to do the Christian life than to think or feel it. A sense of what love for God is must be instilled alongside the wonderful counsels for practical piety in this book."
3,Not the color pictured!,"I bought this item, and it came in today. I was thinking I would be getting a lavendar sheet, but it's pink! Pink is ok too, I guess, at least it still matches the tiddlywinks dust ruffle. I was just looking forward to a laverdar sheet since I prefer it over pink. Can't say anything about the quality since I haven't opened and used it yet. Just wanted to comment on the color difference from the pic so that others are aware! I guess I'll have to find another sheet that IS lavendar and have it as an extra to rotate around as I do wash."
5,Buff raises the bar for the intense sub thriller yet again.,"I just finished reading this last night, and all I can say is I am floored. I could not sleep until I finished this, it was just the best thriller I have read in a long time.This is Joe's second novel following the exploits of the Jeffrey Fuller and the crew of the USS Challenger, and the action is even more gripping than in the first. The conflict is ratcheted up to a whole new level, and the tac nukes fly even more freely.What a grim conflict, what bold heroes, what great characters.Joe is the master of near future sub novel, I now measure all others against his work. Tom Clancy eat your heart out. The only downer about this book is waiting until he finishes his next book. I might recommend you read his first book before reading this one, but it should hold up on it's own just fine."
2,Reads Like an Arcade Game!,"This was my first (and last) Joe Buff read. Picture yourself playing a submarine ""shoot 'em up"" arcade game. Now put that game into print and this is the final product. Mildly entertaining.....if you played this on an Xbox or PC. Virtually no submarine warfare tactics and lets not forget that we all KNOW the US Navy makes it a habit of dispatching sub captains to go ashore in Seal raids. What a farce. Skip the read and find yourself a good game if this is your style. Don't buy the book if you think you are getting a good novel on sub warfare and naval tactics! The story line was thin as well. Purely Duke Nukem!"
1,"Boring, trite, and boring","I invested two hours in reading this book, and then decided thatlife is too short to read anything so bad. The story consistsof endless successions of tactical nuclear explosions. Strangelyenough, these seem to have no side- or after- effects. Justbig booms, which the good guys always survive while the baddiesgo up in bubbles. The author has taken the worst cliches of allprevious submarine warfare novels, added flat and unbelievablecharacters, and carried on for way, way too many pages. Thereare better thrillers out there, don't waste your time."
2,Submarine captain meets 007 meets Rambo,"This will be my last Joe Buff book, there has to be some credibility in the main character actions. Is hard to believe that Jeffry Fuller with his sub and crew can do all the things they did, from kidnapping a German minisub, to infiltrating an ultra top secret enemy facility and stealing its most valuable assets, to sinking dozens of enemy ships and aircraft with sub on SURFACE!There is something call fiction but other completely different is what I witness in this book where all missions where impossible and kamikaze, but always somehow Jeffry Fuller manages to sort it out successfully, in the end I lost the edge I had at the beginning, I believe some balance will be a nice addition if not all credibility is lost."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Thunder in the Deep is very well written and very well researched. Since the September 11 Attack, which has changed the world forever, the story is frighteningly plausible. I really enjoyed reading Thunder in the Deep, and will definitely read Joe Buff's next book too!"
2,"Grim,puerile fantasy","What a pity that so talented a writer reaches so deep into his imagination and comes up with only crumbs of credible narrative. Technologically and militarily,it's typical,excellent Joe Buff,but the scenario is in every sense unbelievable and, thus, the reader tends to become increasingly cynical as the story develops.6 million casualties in a month in this war, with huge physical damage to all combatant countries and our heroes are reacting and responding to it all as if it were just another PacFleet exercise. Give us a break,Joe."
4,An essential dance song for any hip hop fan.,"It is perhaps one of the earliest collaborations between Sean ""Puff Dady"" Combs and Missy Elliot that outshines MC Lyte in this song. A party mix essential, Cold Rock a Party is extremely listenable and danceable, even if its hooks are forgettable once the song is over. Recommended to any fan of the genre."
5,Gorgeous...,"Excellent performance, excellent recording, the best interpretation I know. All this justifies the 5 star-ratings...then add the user friendly and well documented CD Rom... A must have!Bravo Harmonia Mundi!"
2,Nasty piano is no match for beauty of the harpsichord!,"This is an exciting performance of Cosi fan Tutte but what a pity a harpsichord wasn't used instead of a piano though. A harpsichord represents classical grace. That is the prblem with 'the museum mentality' so common today when it comes to classical music. I enjoy baroque music played on museum instruments because the style lends intself to historic performance. However, it spoils it when certain instruments are played because the focus is on history rather than grace and beauty of sound.Not only is the piano used but it sounds like a rather tired thin sounding old instrument that once stood in the corner of a bar or pub! It is a shame because it ruins an otherwise charming set (albeit a museum rendition)."
1,Book? Not Hardly! Booklet at best,"Being a huge David Muench fan prompted me to buy this oversize pamphlet sight unseen,,,at 5 bucks plus shipping it was a waste of money,,about 10 pages of cheap stock and a few unimpressive color pics,,,,I see it is listed at 100 dollars if new,,,,can only say HAH! caveat emptor"
4,5-7 photo protection sheets,"[...] The order arrived promptly. and the photo sheets work perfectly. Several were scratched or slightly marred in some way, but I remain very satisfied with the product."
1,not so good,Ultra Pro 2 Pocket (5-by-7-inch Photos) Pages (100 Pages)not so good very deficit to find pictures that fit did not like it
4,Nice photo sleeves,"Since they advertised 100 pages, we were not sure if that meant 100 counting front and back - which would make 50. But there were in fact 100 separate pages, and you can put 2 photos facing out and 2 photos facing back for 400 photos total. That's a good deal."
1,BUYER BEWARE! Overall size not as advertised!,"I bought these pockets specifically because of this product description: ""Product Dimensions: 12 x 9 x 1.5 inches."" The dimensions are actually 11.25 x 7 7/8 inches!!!!! Ultra Pro put a piece of foam in the box to make up for the missing width of the pockets. Well, I can't use the foam! I wanted to mix and match these pages in a binder with other pockets/sleeves that really are the described 12 x 9 inches, but adding these narrow pages would make for a very messy binder! Some pages wide, others narrow. Ultra Pro, thanks for the false advertising."
5,Love these,"I love the Ultra-Pro photo sleaves. I use them for our kids' photo albums. THey fit in a standard 3-ring binder, so I can expand as needed for very little cost."
4,awww shucks...,"i was lucky enough to have seen the Corn Sisters live quite a few years back and it was an absolutely stellar show. Neko and Carolyn were in fine form and when they weren't sending chills up your spine with their songs, they had you laughing so hard it hurt with their inbetween song banter. it's great to see how much fun these two girls have when they get together and it shows on this disc of live recordings. their natural chemistry spills over in every note. my favorite songs are ""Not A Doll"", ""Don't Let Me Cross Over"", and ""She's Leaving Town"" (a different version of that song is featured as a bonus track on here in which Carolyn sarcastically (?) describes the tune's author as a ""weed-gobbling cheater"" to much laughter). if you are a fan of Neko Case or Carolyn Mark's solo work, then you need the Corn Sisters in your life."
2,Maybe you had to be there,"I'm giving this two stars because I admire Neko Case too much to give anything she does one star. This sounds like an office party, one of those beery nights when someone discovers that two of the women from the accounting department like to sing and play guitar and then everyone gathers around and has a lot of hooting and hollaring fun listening to them immitate country music. I took a chance on this one because I think Case is a real talent. Oh well: you can't win them all."
4,excellent tool for training child coordination,"This is a great tool for teaching small children body control and agility. Over all, very well designed and durable."
4,Hopscotch indoors,"This Hopscotch Rug is very cute and my 8 year old loves it as much as my 5 year old does. When your children aren't playing with it, simply roll it up and put it in the corner or in a closet. A little pricey, but worth the money."
3,parts missing,I purchased this toy for childrens church. The bean bags were missing because of a hole in the plastic that it was shipped in. I emailed the sender and have not heard a word. The carpet itself is a sturdy mat that does not slip on the floor. The kids would love it if it was complete.
4,works well,so far i have used the ratchet and i did not encounter any problems. However i am very careful in using tools. To break very tight bolts i would use the power handle and then use the rachet to completely remove the bolt. Therefore i do not put any stress on the rachet.I believe if used in this way the rachet will last a lifetimedenish rampaul
1,Get what you pay for.,"This ratchet gets the job done, but thats all I can say for it. The first few uses it worked fine, but after about a week of random use it was slipping if to much force was put on it. Would be great for very low torque applications around the house, definately not for work."
5,Wonderful Ty Beanie Baby,"Really cute, durable, and of course you can't go wrong with pink. Its the perfect size and really soft. Ty Beanie Baby's at its best"
4,Wood Stand Table,Very nice small table worth the money. Used as a night stand has worked out very well
4,plant stand,i found it very easy to put togetheri have it in my foyer and it matches the hard wood floor perfectly i have recieved many compliments on it and people cant believe its from target it very sturdy and good quality i strongly recommend this product.
4,Ingenious man,"First off if you looking for a movie that informational on the subject of permaculture itself I would not recommend this one. This is more of a biographical movie about one mans triumph and success using permacultural methods in a country that does not support it. The scenery is beautiful, and the idea of a man living so much ""with"" nature rather than ""in"" it is touching. If you're looking for a movie showing permacultural scenery i would suggest this. I just wish it was longer so I could've seen and/or learned more about HIS methods and more detail of the contents of his many gardens."
4,A good starting place,This guide does not help much in giving information- but it was helpful as a starting point for studying. I looked up every answer I didn't know- and every possible choice I didn't know and felt very prepared going into the test. The graded answers for the essay questions were the greatest help the book provided. Having the essay questions to practice on (and set the proper time limit with ) was very helpful. I was able to compare my answers with the graded answers and better understand what they were looking for and how I could improve my essays.
2,Don't bother,Bought this book for the Art:Content Knowledge test and found I paid for only 24 relevant pages out of a 186 page book. Don't bother if you only need to take one of the art related tests. Go to the web site and view the sample test online for free and search other sites for test content. Otherwise there is some advise on how to take a praxis test--oh boy!
1,Praxis 2 Art Content Test changes!,"Be aware that there is a new Praxis Art Content Test effective Sept. 1, 2011, for many states. The new test is (0134) There will likely be changes in the content. Make sure you are studying material for the correct test!"
2,Not really useful,This product was not really that useful. Its study terms were very broad and didn't help me narrow down my search. The practice test was partly helpful but I had already taken a practice test and was looking for something a little more substantial. Over all I can't really recommend this product to anyone.
4,Good for Basics and refresher!,Was recieved in a timely fashion. It covers basic info on the tests. One would have to know more than what is in the book to pass the test with a respectable score.
3,"Helpful, but incomplete","I read other reviews before I bought this book and found that they were helpful. This book only is helpful in a few areas for Art: Content Knowledge test (0133) - test-taking advice and taking a practice test. All the content of the test is based on art history, aesthetics and experience in art media. The book is not worth full price, get a used one or study art history throughly and become an expert in all fields of art!"
2,Save your money!,"This book was written for the Art Content Knowledge 0133 test (and 0131/0132). On September 1, 2011, ETS began administering an updated version of this test (Art Content Knowledge 0134) which places more emphasis on art making than art history. I don't recommend this book if you are taking the new test because the questions are very different. I suppose it was a starting point, but there are much more helpful books and resources to study from. Also, the first 2 chapters of this book tell you how to take a multiple choice test, which is not what I thought I was paying $50 for."
2,Not that helpful,Try to get a used copy otherwise this is a waste of money. The only good part is that it has a practice test with the answers. No real tips or other good info. I Suggest just studying from Garner's Art Through the Ages.
2,Praxis,"Unfortunately, the Praxis II for Art has changed so this book is outdated. However, some of the stuff is still the same and this is really the only book for it. I thought it was useful... but buy it used!"
4,Study Guide Book Review,This book arrived quickly and it was just what I needed. The best part was it cost less than ordering it through the Praxis website.
3,"One of my favorite preachers, not my favorite commentary","Craddock is one of the best preachers of the last fifty years. At least in my estimation. He is an excellent instructor of preachers, but I found this commentary to be to short, lacking in access to more substantial resources and at points off topic. It is at its best when used with a few other commentaries on Luke. If you can only purchase one, this is not your commentary."
4,good garden timer,"This timer has never failed me, it's built well. The only thing I don't love about it is the menu system ... I can never remember what buttons to push when programming it."
4,Easy to program for various days of the week,We live in an area where we can only water on certain days and within certain time of the day. This timer allows me to easily set the specific days and times that I want my grass watered.
1,Impossible to program,Don't buy this. The manual is confusing and I have yet to successfully program it. It's just gathering dust. Best I can do is set the current time of day and day of the week. That's all.
1,Good for one season!,"I've gone through 4 of these, 2 with the LCD timer and 2 with the mechanical timers. They lasted one season each. I always pull thme at the end of fall and store them for the winter.One has a stuck closed valve. All have a white plastic (PVC?) insert underthe top bib's rubber hose washer and all are cracked causing water to leak.I wrote to Orbit about the problems, no response.My thinking: look at other products. Too expensive for one season of use!"
4,"Great piece, but let it air out first","I bought this screen at our local Target. My husband and I had been looking for an interesting headboard for our bed that would remind us of our Jamaican honeymoon. The bamboo and the color of the wood were perfect for what we were looking for. We opened it flat and put it against the wall behind our bed. (We figured if we get tired of it we can always use it as a screen later.) It's lovely and we're very happy with it, but the first week the smell in our bedroom was a bit much--especially at night when we were sleeping with it mere inches from our noses. If it hadn't been so much trouble to get it behind our bed I think I would have moved it to another part of the house until the smell from the finish had gone away. I recommend it, but keep the smell factor in mind."
4,Very Helpful,I have played the piano for years and decided to learn the organ. Since I already new how to play the manuals I had no idea what to do with my feet. However this book made it easy and quick for me to learn.
1,there's a lot more to the organ than the pedals,"If you want a ""quickie"" transition from the piano to the organ, pick up this book. You'll be able to fake it, and no one will know that you are not a ""real"" organist.However, for a pianist, there is a lot more to the organ than just the pedals. You may think you already know how to play the manuals, but it is very different from playing the piano. If you want a comprehensive organ method book, pick up Harold Gleason's well crafted text for serious organ students. It's worth your time and money."
4,"Practical, easy to apply strategies.","This book gave me a lot of ideas for getting students to probe into a text to get beyond basic comprehension of a text to creating personal meaning from text. Her techniques are for every student, the talented and the struggling. The only frustrating thing I found about the book is she assumes all teachers work in ideal environments. She tells teachers to get parents to donate post its for the note taking strategy she uses. Parents at my inner city school would not do this."
1,CRACKED on 1st USE :-(,"It would have been great.. but on it's FIRST use on Medium heat, midway through cooking, I heard a loud POP sound; only to realize it CRACKED!!! Unbelievable!!"
4,a little hard to clean,I love how this item heats but I am having difficulty in cleaning it.I use only hot water and a stiff brush but at time have to soak it a bit. I do also treat it with oil and let it sit on the burner at low for about an hour but still having difficulty with meat sticking to it. Don't know what else to try. Anyone have any suggestions?
3,Hard to Clean Grill,"It lives on one burner, so it's constantly in the way. I'm still gradually achieving a proper seasoning (bacon fat). I scrape any sticky egg crumbs off with a cheap old nylon spatula but I will need to give in to Amazon's insistence that I purchase a Lodge grill scraper if we are to enjoy grilled meats. A simple non-stick skillet would be easier, though not necessarily better."
4,If you love grilled foods,"but live in an apartment, this is great. I don't have to turn on my oven to grill chicken, salmon, steak, pork chops, etc. I use it everyday. The griddle side is perfect for pancakes, crepes, etc. although I use this side less frequently.I purchased this item after having had a larger version by another manufacturer but the metal warped severely after years of use. it was not cast iron.This item will not warp but, buyer beware, it is very heavy and is not easy to clean."
5,Cast Iron For Sustainability!,"I just recieved my single burner griddle and it fits the burner perfect. I have other Lodge cast iron products and I like the company and product. I used to have a two burner griddle, I found it difficult to season and cook with because there was a dead spot with no heat between the burners, that's why I went with the single burner style. It cooked my venison perfectly!! I just whipped up and egg mc muffin fast. Great for sustainability, it will last forever! Can't say that for teflon.www.SedonaCreations.com"
1,Uneven griddle heating,"I bought this because I was looking for a small griddle to replace an aluminum one I had for years that had started to warp. From many of the reviews it seemed cast iron was the way to go. It wouldn't warp and it was supposed to provide very even heating. Sadly, my experience on the later point says that is not true for this griddle. No matter what approach I took to heating it up, items always came out unevenly cooked. The portions near the center (those over the burner) were nicely cooked and brown while anything over the corners were no where near cooked. I tried all sorts of ways of heating it up. Turning the burner on to medium-low for 10 minutes before hand, turning the burner high before cooking at then turning it down, leaving it on high. Nothing provided satisfactory results unless I was constantly rotating the items cooking, which I've never had to do on other griddles. Overall, very dissapointing.(I can't comment on the grill side as I never used it.)"
5,LODGE REVERSIBLE GRILL/GRIDDLE,"Do you like making grilled sandwiches, or making omelets, even short stacks of pancakes, then this single grill/griddle is for you, I use it, and it fits the bill, easy to clean, and easy to use. It fits over one burner on your stove, or if you use a single burner cook top, it's perfect. You can even grill burgers, and steak without having to setup a grill. I enjoy using mine, I'm sure you will also, give it a try, the price is right, what do you have to lose."
4,Very good,"I love the design of this pan. Very easy to use, even on my glass top stove.The burgers were okay. Much better than a frying pan, but not as good as a charcoal grill. I am thinking that as this pan seasons more and more, the flavor will get better.Clean-up wasn't as easy as I expected. I thought it was a bit more seasoned, based on the literature, but it could have used a coating of coconut oil prior to the first 3-5 uses.All in all, we are satisfied with this pan."
1,"Low quality, buy something else.","This product is not worth buying. I used it one time, washed it and let air dry and it rusted. What a waste of money!"
5,BUY this TODAY!!!,I absolutely LOVE this little grill!! It cooks everything PERFECTLY and is so easy to clean up. It fits just right over my gas burner and I also use it on my BBQ grill.
5,Now I'm grilling indoors!,"Received, seasoned & used my new grill. It is great. Love the grill marks and will use this a lot and I know it will get better and better with time. Good size for two people and nice and heavy. Very happy with this purchase."
2,Horrible,"Nightmare to clean, now it seems to have a rusty look at edge. Tried to clean as soon as done cooking (steaks)"
5,Great for cooking on the grill,I was looking for a cast iron surface that I could use on my Weber Grill. This is the perfect size.
2,Too bad...,"I like David Pybus and his writing. The contents seems well researched, etc., but what's going on with the illustrations?! They're the stereotypical depiction of ""Japanese people"" by Westerners unfamiliar with Japanese kimonos and Japanese cultures. The illustrations are such caricatures and are so awful that they make this otherwise decent book unauthentic and somewhat insulting. I'm really disappointed as I had high hopes for a book coming from someone like Mr. Pybus. Though I think David Pybus probably knows much more about fragrances and fragrance materials, I would recommend Kiyoko Morita's ""The Book of Incense"" over this book for information about kodo."
3,NOT BAD,"THIS BOOK IS A LOT LIKE MORETAS BOOK. IF YOU BOUGHT THAT BOOK YOU DONT NEED THIS ONE TO, BUT IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY BOOKS ABOUT JAPANESE INCENSE GET THIS ONE. I WISH IT TALKEDMORE ABOUT OTHER PARTS OF AISA. IF YOUR READING ABOUT JAPAN THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. IF YOUR READING TO LEARN ABOUT INCENSE DONT FORGET TO READ BOOKS ABOUT EURPEAN AND AMERICAN INCENSE TRADITIONS TO. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT ALL GOOD INCENSE AND TRADITIONS COME FROM JAPAN BUT INCENSE IS PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE WHOLE WORLD."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Kenneth wrote the songs and devoted them to the people he loves most. His songs are a breath of fresh air.I highly recommend this CD.Linda
1,Sent this back...,This certainly does not work on the Hitachi DZHS903A that I have despite it being the only item that keeps coming up when I search for lens. Sent it back. The service and help I got from the store was great but the product just isn't it! Use the camera for normal fun videos (Hitachi is not around anyway)and buy a good camera with good lens for wide angle pictures. Not worth the aggravation
2,on n'a pas fait mention,on n'a pas fait mention qu'il falait payer les dédouanement $49.90 plus frais de douane de $21.00 ca fait cher un peu une pièce qui était vendue $29.95
4,Sima 4 way speaker switch,"Very nice switch and very competitively priced. I ordered and installed last spring and have had this box in full service (4 sets of speakers) with zero defects ever since. It was about half the price of brick and mortar store comps and was a snap to set up. My only issue with it is that the volume controls are ""notched"" and not as smooth as on the receiver, so it tends to go from too soft to too loud with one click. I get around this by using the master volume control on the receiver to fine tune, but that is really just a slight annoyance. Otherwise, I'd give this box a 5 star rating of value for the money."
5,sima ssw review,This product performed perfectly and was extremely easy to install. I would not hesitate to recommend this item to anyone.
3,not as good as the rest.,"I've read all of the puzzle lady novels and have enjoyed them all, but this one is not up to par. First, the cursing has escalated both in frequency and severity. Before, it was an occasional ""he-- or sh--"", but now it's gone to more unexceptable ones & pops up much more often. This one is also too much about Cora. There is very little interaction w/the people who make the stories good. Her antics are way over the top & the solution is one that the reader couldn't possibly see coming. That's not all bad, I suppose, but it needs to have some line to follow & this is way out there. I'm about to start the next one, but if this style keeps up, it will be the last."
1,I think chian is well odd....,this book helped me very very little and I offened several china men and women in my visit and had a very bad time.
2,Complete Garbage becomes somewhat acceptable with tweaking,"Like others, my box would lose its internet connection every 15 minutes or so. The wireless feature was dropping off at two feet! WEP was making the connection, but I was unable to get any further.I found that my 3.2GHz phone was causing the wireless distance problems. I figured the power supply may not be supplying enough current, so rigged a connection to my computer's power supply, which provides the necessary 5V. The system now only loses the internet connection about 5 times a day.I conclude that this device is garbage, but I am stuck with it for now. DON'T BUY ONE!! In fact, (and I would never have said this 5 years ago) don't buy USR products at all.Funny.. just found out my interent connection was down when I tried to submit this. had to reboot my box yet again. GARBAGE!"
1,Junk,"I took this router - tossed it in the garbage after spending an hour on the phone with the ""tech"" - (the phone call at my expense) after the hour his comment was ""well maybe it is defective"" - I then went out and purchased a D-link router and junked this one - they wanted me to pay $25 to expidite the replacement - or I could wait two to three weeks while I shipped mine back (at my expense) so that they could fix it - by the way I won't be buying any other US Robotics junk any more"
1,Poor Perfomance and Quality,"Received my first 8022 and it would work for 15 minutes then stop... Called USR and was told to send back... The second unit arrived (Thanks Amazon for the fast turn around) An it worked for hours at a time before locking up or slowing down to a crawl, and this was from a hard wired port! The wireless range was terrible. Using a laptop with a USR PCMCIA wireless card from 2 feet away only resulted in a 90% signal... Next room over barely worked... Avoid this one..."
5,I'm new to darts,"My roommate and I just bought a dart board and two sets of these darts. At first I thought these seemed kind of expensive, but they looked good and I couldn't really find anything much cheaper. Well, now that we've got them, I'm glad we got these nicer darts rather than trying to find something really cheap just because we are beginners. I love these darts! They are definitely the nicest darts I've ever played with. Great feel, and a nice weight.PLUS, they come with a very nice case that they don't even show in the picture.Like I said, I'm new to darts, but I love these darts. They're great!"
5,"Funny, Touching, Memorable","Hey, Big Legs... is a small, but powerful and engrossing collection of poems. The poet paints very vivid imageswith her words. ""Truth"" is about the funniest poem I'veever read, while ""She Won't Be Back"" can bring a tear tothe eye. Brown is a very talented writer. I look forward toher next effort."
2,I agree that it is dull and quite futile reading,"I recommend reading some of Frege's own works, most notably the Foundations of Arithmetic. This book can not convey the energy and enthusiasm they carry. It gives the impression that all Frege's concern was building a logical notation that would express the validity of 'mathematical induction', a form of inference that can not be accounted for in Aristotalian logic. No real further insight into Frege has been accomplished.. try one of the shorter works of Dummet like the Origins of Analytic Philosophy, i think would be much more interesting and also instructive."
1,4Woodys,"This item will not work on computers using Windows Vista 64 bit operating system. I called Garmin to confirm it. Garmin has no plans to write new software for this item or upgrade the use of it for the older Rino's GPS. If you want to download geocaches, you will have to upgrade to a newer Garmin unit that uses an USB cable and is compatible with a Vista 64 bit system."
2,Works for Windows XP Pro,Works for Windows XP Pro but no drivers available for Vista or Windows 7! This converter works great but why does Garmin make it so difficult and costly to keep the unit working with computer upgrades. Won't be buying any Garmins in the future...
1,"You have to be kidding, $52 for a USB cable","$52 for a $1 cable and software that should be included with the unit, hard to believe."
3,O.K. for minimal exfoliating,"I bought these to help with eczema dry skin. They do offer a subtle exfoliation. They are a little too big, I have a medium size female hand. Also they were pictured in a dark green color, but the ones I received were the color of lime green sherbet (pale light green)."
2,Functional but ugly!,"It may be a matter of taste, but these little drink lights have some of the weirdest (and unattractive) colors I have ever seen in novelty lights. They would be fine for a tree, but forget about hanging them near your home bar or kitchen - they look like poorly painted toys!"
5,Great for detailing my Audi A4,"As has been said a dozen times in the reviews, this is a great product. It works well for cleaning your dash, steering wheel, interior trim pieces, cup holders, you name it. Lots of folks really like the smell, and while I don't dislike it, to me it just smells like citrus windex. Everyone does comment that my car smells nice if I pick them up soon after a detailing, so that's good.I bought einszett Cockpit by the recommendation of other Audi owners and I'm definitely glad I took the suggestion. It is safe on all the interior pieces of my 2008 Audi A4 (B7 model). For your leather I'd suggestMeguiar's Gold Class Rich Leather Spray, 15.2 oz.This stuff does a great job cleaning and protecting the seats and has a very pleasant smell. If the headliner (ceiling fabric) gets dirty I've had good luck withQUIK OUT CARPET STAIN REMOVER 22FL OZ."
5,Removed a magic marker stain from my interior,"I bought this based on a previously good experience with another einszett producteinszett 921008 Kristall Klar Washer Fluid Concentrate - 8.5 fl. oz.. Not a 'on label' use, but as a unexpected surprise, this lifted a magic marker stain off of one the plastic interior panels.I'm not a car cleaning fanatic by any means, but this stuff is nice for cleaning the dash, radio and other sensitive parts. As other reviewers have noted, it leaves a matte, not glossy finish."
5,Great cleaning product,If you are looking for a streak free cleaner that gives a matte finish with zero gloss.. this is the cleaner for you. I would use a protectant after using this. I use the aerospace 303 protectant and it works great. The smell is a bit strong but its tolerable.
5,Great Stuff,"I had this product recommended to me as a mild cleaner with good protective properties. I found this to be very much the case. I thought the product smelled pretty good and just cleaned up everything beautifully. Equally important, it leaves behind a nice OEM finish, not shiny like other interior cleaners I've used in the past (mostly NXT and new Armorall). This is really some premium stuff, but after using it in a few cars it seems like my bottle will last a good while."
3,I like a clean car,"I purchased this item to get scuff marks off the plastic trim in my seven-year-old Prius and my three-year-old Highlander. It worked okay, but even after scrubbing several times, both cars still had visible scuff marks."
5,Jhudnalls review on quake 2,"Quake 2 is a revolutionary breakthrough game of tis times with stunning graphics and clear network play, full of action and fun, this is a must game for all gamers, this game is by far a keeper for a long time.."
4,Stand is nice,"This stand is nice but a few complaints and uncertainty about it.1. the stand seems a bit unlevel when put on the carpet.2. i have read some reviews about a sagging problem on the front of the tv. I can see how this could be a problem since the front doesn't strecth out to the front of the tv.3. the stand doesn't come with dots or felt to keep your tv from sliding off the stand. Which could be easily done since the tv is so light in weight.4. the shelving system seems a bit flimsy as well, my xbox and sat reciever on the bottom shelf pushes it to it's weight limits i think.I've only had this stand for a few days but all in all it's style and engineering is nice. Haven't had any problems so far."
5,Amazing Bible,"This is truly a beautiful bible. I did not buy it for the construction but for the AV 1611 and translators preface to the AV 1611. To my delight the bible is a joy to read, hold and smell the goatskin. I was worried about the size of font before receiving the bible (40ish year old eyes). But the font, quality and paper are easily readable. The bible came without defects. I'm tickled with this bible and have owned many different types of bibles. I must concur that this is the best quality bible I have ever owned. More importantly this is the preserved Word of God from this generation forever.Psalms 12:6-7I highly recommend this holy bible."
3,Interesting,"CHARLES DICKENS' Children StoriesRE-TOLD BY HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND OTHERSWITH TWELVE FULL-PAGE ILLUSTRATIONSPHILADELPHIA HENRY ALTEMUS COMPANYCopyright, 1900, by HENRY ALTEMUS COMPANYDickens, Charles (2011-08-23). Charles Dickens' Children Stories (Kindle Locations 2-5). . Kindle Edition."
1,Dickens?,I have read a lot of Dickens and thought I would enjoy these stories. They seem unfinished and lack detail.
1,no,Sorry so many words I don't let my kids read I deleted this from my daughters kindle sorry don't like
2,Not appealing to adults or children.,It's hard to reduce Dickens' stories into a few pages and still retain anything that makes them interesting and worth reading.
5,TAD GREAT,"This band deserves to be heard, and pushed, to the masses that love powermetal. If you don't have this in your collection, buy it now!"
2,A bleak portrait of a nation in crisis,"If you are looking for a general overview of South Africa's landscape and peoples, skip this and buy the ""Video Visits"" production instead. ""Capetown"" seems to be concerned mainly with the country's racial strife and chaotic political situation shortly after Nelson Mandela came to power. It includes many interviews with South African whites and blacks from various walks of life, who are allowed to speak their minds freely. However, be warned that a strong anti-white sentiment permeates throughout (it's a PBS production), and the viewer is left disappointed without any introduction to the African tribal or Afrikaner cultures."
5,Wonderful artwork,"A short Mary Blair biography, beatifully illustrated with Blair's work and some photos of her at different points at life. The text is simple and pleasant, but won't get much deep into her work. In addition to that, the volume of pictures is very modest compared to Mary's output, so the selection stands more for a brief portfolio of the artist, rather than a thorough compilation of her tremendous number of works. The design of the book is really beatiful and worth every penny, and if one desires a general overview of Mary's flair, this books suits perfectly."
3,It's a Small World Legend,"When I visited Disneyland last year with my daughter I expected to fall in love all over again with various attractions at the park: Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Carousel. I honestly didn't expect to fall in love all over again with ""It's a Small World"" but I did.I had already heard the name, Mary Blair, but I didn't know anything about her so I decided to research her online and I found this book.What an incredible artist she was! John Cane tells her story and her contributions to everything Disney. She was an incredible artist! Her works now sell for many hundreds of dollars. It's too bad that she didn't live long enough to see herself become famous. Like most artists, she became famous after her death. At any rate, here is the story of the woman who created so much of the Disney magic. It's very well illistrated and an enjoyable read."
2,"2.5 stars, tops.","the reviewer who states this book is a disappointment is dead on. i'm a fan of blair and eagerly awaited this book's arrival. i'm astounded at the amount of work not represented here, especially considering the price. blair was an AMAZING colorist and the poor reproductions don't do her work justice."
4,Works as advertised,"This speaker selector works as advertised. It is easy to set up. I am not an audiofile or an expert. Set up took about 25 minutes, including reading the simple manual. I had 6 pairs of speakers to install. The plug-in terminals made this simple. A definite improvement over my 4 pair ProLogic speaker selector. The only complaints I have are minor. A) There are no labels for the different speaker pairs. I had to use my old labels from the ProLogic. B) There is no indicator light to tell you which speaker pair is on. I have speakers outside and I have to walk to the unit to determine if that pair is on or not."
2,ERRORS IN BOOK ABOUT GOVERNOR WAITE; a.k.a. BLOODY BRIDLES,"This book contains interesting data, yet lacks in historical facts about the origin of the nick-name Bloody Bridles, given to Governor Waite in 1893. The book states the nick-name was given for his defense of Populist programs. NOT TRUE !!!Governor Waite was called Bloody Bridles for a speech he gave on July 11, 1893; against the impending repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, that de-monitized Silver.To see more on this subject; GoTo YAHOO search engine- Enter THE GHOSTWALKER; click on Aspen icon, wait to load sound.... The story of BLOODY BRIDLES and his monument will tell the truth....."
2,Kinda fits,"Rubber is ok, not as thick as others. I drive a Volvo V50 and they kinda fit; but not really. For the price they should include the backseat too, not just the front. I don't plan on returning them, but if I saw them first in the store, I probably wouldn't have bought them."
4,Great book!,"I really enjoyed this book as it was captivating, sexy, and mysterious. I couldn't put it down. I am a huge Linda Howard fan and this definitely met up with my expectations. Some parts of the book are very dark (killing of a child, the almost rape, etc.), but Linda is an excellent writer and she is able to weigh the good against the bad in a way the draws the reader in and in the end saves the day with stability and love for the main character."
4,Dream Man,The book was fun and exciting. Again Linda Howard gave me an ending that I gives me a thrill and inspires me to read more of her work.
5,One of the best books I've read!,This was the first book I had read by Linda Howard and I was very impressed. I enjoyed the mystery and especially the chemistry between these two. I have read all other books that I could find by Linda Howard and was equally impressed. They all have passion with a touch of mystery that keep you enthralled from the beginning til the end. I would love to read any other author who writes similar to her.
2,"Ugh, yuck.","A vivid description of love scenes is nice. However, a thorough account of the travails of the ""head"" of anyone's *anything* is more than I needed to know. (Or maybe that particular phrasing was only in Howard's ""After The Night."" Either way, both books had unduly rough, uncaring and unskilled sexual encounters that weren't enjoyable to read about.) In ""Dream Man"", the heroine is a passive, trembling flower most of the time and her love interest is a presumptuous, low-class conniver. What a charming couple. Finally, several sections of the book just didn't seem to add much of anything to the story. They seemed to have been tossed in there for ""color"" but were just irrelevant. Save your time and money."
1,Really?,"I bought this book because Deanna Raybourn recommended it in an Amazon Daily posting under the heading of her most favorite Romance books ever. To that I say, really? I found the book to be a strange mixture of compelling and annoying. The suspense and mystery were fairly well written but the main characters were vapid and lacking in dimension. Also, the killer is named in the middle of the book thereby removing all suspense. I almost didn't finish the book. Now, not only have a wasted my time on a so-so romance/mystery, I probably won't read any more Deanna Raybourn based on this terrible recommendation."
5,Fantastic read.,"While reading Dream Man I was unable to put it down. Linda Howard, you've done it again. I find that I can actually see these characters as they are written. While the detective wanted to solve this case he also did not want to be attracted to the main female role. However the ending of the story was so great that it is a shame more men can't feel what it's like to give birth. Linda, way to go. Keep up the good work."
4,A great romantic suspense thriller!,I brought this book on vacation & finished it in 2 days. Sizzling yet sweet love story between Marlie & Dane. Great secondary characters. Creepy killer. A wonderful psychological suspense novel!
4,Loved This Book!,"This was the first Linda Howard book I read. Dane was so caring and giving, he was wonderful with Marlie. It was definately one of those books I couldn't put down. This one had great characters, a gripping plot and romance. I have read a lot more books by this author. I can say I've liked most of them."
5,Great first choice,"This was the first Linda Howard book I've read and it quickly made me a new fan. This book has an interesting story, great character development and romance. The only problem was the short epilogue (confusing), but regardless of that the rest of the book was great."
2,Definitely not one of her best!,"Yes, I think the storyline was okay, but Dane was WAY too macho for me. The way he kept calling her ""babe"" drove me insane! I found it very hard to like the characters in this book. I am a huge Linda Howard fan and I was disappointed with this read."
5,The Best!,"I could not put this book down. It was the first of Linda Howard's that I had read and rushed right out buy more. I loved Marlie and Dane, I loved the story, and thought the sexual tension and sex scenes were some of the best I've ever read. Keep up the great work, Linda. I'll be buying every one of your books."
5,Fantastic!,"One of my all-time favorite authors is Linda Howard, and this book is one of her best! I've read it three times and I'm sure I'll read it again. Thanks Ms. Howard!"
3,"It's a good book, but not her best work","When I first started reading this book, I was intrigued to see how it played out. But as I went along, and the two characters met up for the first time, I felt the cheese factor begin to rise. I have never heard of a man getting ... ahem ... ""rock hard"" the instant he sees a woman. (Or, perhaps, I just live in too conservative a town.) Dane and Marlie never made a big splash with me. Separately, they were good characters. Together they just didn't mesh. However, the villian of this book is perfectly terrifying and that kept me going page after page. As another reviewer pointed out, ""All The Queen's Men"" is a much better read. If you are a first time Linda Howard reader, try it instead of this one."
2,Beware of the 5 rating!,"I am not even close to halfway through this book and I am ready to return this book. I am an avid reader of Romance suspense and the build of romance between the two is just lame. and I agree with the other reviewers, Dane saying babe is annoying! If you love Judith McNaught, Julie Garwood, this book will disappoint."
2,A little too descriptive w/the gory details.,"i enjoy most of Linda Howard's stories, but her trend toward descriptive scenes of rape, mutilation & murder (which is definitely the case here & was to an extent in Now You See Her, which i also did not like) is just not my cup of tea. i really couldn't wait to finish this book & am being generous in giving it 2 stars. i much prefer her MacKenzie series (can't wait for Chance's story), her westerns & of course, Son the Morning."
3,One for the fans,"I personally love most of Linda Howards stories and i really enjoyed this book but its typical Howard, in so far as the woman is to innocent, and the man is such a stud, this is the part of her books i do not always enjoy the only saving grace is that he our hero is devoted to the heroine. The plot was pretty good and kept you mostly guessing. Howard has written much better books."
1,you get what you paid for?,"this hat is crappy. i mean, it was cheap so i won't even bother returning it but it doesn't really stretch at all. it's really bad material and it's not shaped correctly. just didn't like it."
5,This book remains on top of my shelf!,"This book is full of the most beautiful plants; half of them ""must haves""!I have had it for years, but it has not left my top shelf!If you are looking for special plants, not the ones *all* of your neighbours have, this is the book for you.Some of the trees ( for example a variegated Hawthorn) are impossible to find here, but it is good to know such a tree is out there :-)It keeps me dreaming about these plants, in a garden of the future, when I have enough room for several more trees!Whole heartedly recommend!"
5,Great DVD and good service,If you've never heard Corrine Bailey Rae this is the one to buy.Great service also. Came before the scheduled delivery date.
3,CD Review,I'm giving the product 3 stars but frankly I was a little disappointed in the quality of the sound engineering and in her performance. The studio version of the album is better...
5,A Future Music Super Talent,"As youthful as she is, Ms. Rae has the poise, sophistication and soul of seasoned performer. Yet, she balances that with charm and innocence. Her singing voice cannot be matched. The almost perfect control of her modulation,pitch,timing,and range are evident from her choice of material. The only difficulty I have is: what musical genre is she in? The choices of songs in this album cover, jazz, blues, soul, ballad, pop,... With the musical talent she has developed and trained, I hope Ms. Rae continues to develop her gifts, as both a singer and songwriter, so more and more people will appreciate this wonderful artist."
4,Attractive and frugal,"These LEDs are slightly directional, but still sufficiently bright in all directions to look good. They consume almost no electricity and none of them has burned out. I expect many years of use. I'm pleased."
4,wonderful but ..,"I ordered the bench to have a seating place or a place for my guest to put their suitcase in the spare bedroom. The assembly was easy but .. The last drawer did not have the correct screws enclosed. So I had to stop by my local hardware store to complete the bench. But it is a wonderful, well made piece of furniture. It was actually what I was looking for.I highly recommend it."
3,doesn't have 2 drawers,I gave this a 3 star instead of 4 stars because of the false advertising. This bench does not have drawers. The top lifts up and then you can store stuff in it. I still really like it and think it is a good quality for the price. Quite sturdy and it looks like the picture.
1,"Cute, but disappointing!",I had my eye on this bench for my front hallway for awhile. I finally bought it last week on sale. My husband put it together easily. The trouble came when you sit on it. The top only is a cheap thin piece of wood (which I didn't pay attention to originally). Of course it cracked after 5 days. It was cracked by just sitting and changing shoes (the person only weighs 195 lbs.). Now I have to return it and find something as cute but made better.
3,Attractive bench,"It was a little smaller than I expected, and like the other people who purchased this, I was disappointed with the cushion cover. But it is very attractive-looking, and will be useful next to my piano to hold music. My only other complaint is that the pressboard used for the drawer bottoms is rather thin, and I don't know how well it will hold up."
2,Nice design but poorly constructed,"The only thing keeping us from taking this bench back to target is that the design looks good in our room. It took us over an hour to put it together because of the poor construction of the drawers. The slots in the drawer fronts were not routed well enough so we had to scrape them clean. Also, what they don't show you in the photo is that the particle board drawer sides are visible through the side of the bench and they don't match the rest of the bench (I mean, not even close!!). I will have to find some paint or something to match."
3,perfect for any room,"I've had my eye on this for a while, and bought it on sale. It was fairly easy to put together - and I really hate putting furniture together. The drawers were a little difficult to get exactly right, though. Can't decide whether to put it in my bathroom or bedroom."
4,"Good value, functional","This piece is a great addition to my room. I'm a student, and the bench is a good place to store some extra books and have a place for guests to sit when they are in my bedroom. It's true that the quality could be better, but I think it's a good value for the price."
4,Perfect for my needs,I think this bench is great. It sits under a window and my dogs lounge on it and watch the neighborhood. Good for small storage and a nice place to sit and tie your sneakers. The construction may be a little cheap...not for heavy duty use. I do sit on it all the time with no problems though.
2,"Nice decoration, not too functional","Just wanted to agree with the other low rating of this bench. It's a great accent piece, but it doesn't support much weight due to the low quality construction."
2,Wish I had listened,"I wish I had listened to the reviews I read. It looks great after recovering the seat, but cracked under the pressure of 120 lbs. If a rail thin woman can break it, what's the point?"
4,Also a path to understanding Spain and its culture,"Mr Hughes' writing skills - which include a peppering of modern analogies, a sharp wit and an uncensored vocabulary -combine with a considerable feeling for his subject to enliven this book on Goya. Apart from his artistic expertise and technical knowledge of art generally, his sympathetic explication of the many works referred to bring the reader to a state of warm understanding of the evolution of this major artist. In addition, the non-expert, as I am, comes away with a better understanding of the Spanish and Spain. A most enjoyable read."
2,I Couldn't Have Said It Better,"I was going to write a review of this book, but after reading S Calwas's opinion, I am going to refer the reader to it; I concur on every point made. Although I am enjoying the book, I have been distracted by the poor editing."
5,One of great Antec cases,"It fits to the 12"" X 9.6"" board standard. I use P4S8X. It comes with 300w power supply(SL300S) and it is really quite same as my True430. 5.25"" bays don't require screws...it said SLK2600AMB not SLK2600AMG...That means ""Antec Metallic Bronze (AMB)"" It is absolutely Metallic Bronze not Black. If you plan to buy the case with this size, this model will be the best choice..."
5,It's not BLACK!,"It's a great case but it's not black. It's what they call metallic bronze (which is actually medium gray, not very ""bronze"" at all!}. Please change your description so that other's don't get stuck with a case they don't want. It does have quick release drive bays which is great."
3,Just similar to Curious George,The picture looks much better that the real toy. As you can see the picture is very much like the cartoon. When I received it I was dissapointed. Colors are not bright and face is not that fun as the picture.
3,Good But Problems,I bought my unit a few years ago. I really liked it (Although the ear bud headphones aren't very good). Like another reviewer I too eventually started having problems with the plug in port for the head phones or the stereo adapter for my truck. It would keep losing one side or the other until i moved the jack around and got both sides again. Eventually I got another better unit with more space (Still Creative) and I've use this one docked in my bathroom where it does just fine because it doesn't move around.....But I didn't buy such a small unit to have it just docked like that....At least it still works well...If you do decide to set a docking area I'd forget about getting the little speakers that Creative sells especially for these units. They sound like tin. I have speakers from an older computer that makes it sound much better by far.
3,Great for research...,"... but I'm afraid the overall content & quality did not not justify the high price - and I'm someone who usually eats up anything Lombard, regardless of cost. Don't get me wrong - I'm glad to have this in my collection, but the biography section did not reveal anything new and priced at 50 dollars, I guess I expected the quality & content to be better. The layout, paper and typeface are atrocious. Still, I'm giving it three stars because it is well-written and frankly, I would not deter anyone from learning more about an actress who was not only an icon of the Golden Age of Hollywood, but also a wonderful human being."
2,Many points of interest; heavy dependence on fan magazines,"Some rare photos, plus this book contains the CAB report on Lombard's 1942 plane crash ~ interesting. Matzen relies heavily on contemporary fan magazine articles profiling Lombard, which do her a disservice of sorts, since they more than likely originated with publicity handouts from the studio or her press agent. Filmography is quite thorough. Overall, an intriguing addition to the library of any Lombard enthusiast. (Beware the typesetters' chosen font -- VERY tough on the eyes!)"
2,Wrought with error...,"I consider myself a pretty intelligent person. Some of the questions on the practice tests were phrased in such a way that the correct answer could be any number of things including more than just one on the list. There are various gramatical errors throughout the book. It seemed to me like the whole thing was rushed. If you want to get this book, I suggest getting accompanying material. I personally don't trust the book to the point that I would invest my future in it."
4,A good guide,"The Ultramodern Firearms guide is a well organized, presented and laid out guide detailing a huge variety of different firearms. The books is well made and attractive. The strong point is that there are visual representations of all the weapons which enables you to something that really suits the image you have developed for your character or NPC.The weak point would be the statisics that go along with each weapons, but to be fair its not really needed. If the statistics for the weapons really upset you, just use the guide as insperation and just use the statistics for the equivalent weapon in whatever game system you are using.This isn't a Jane's publication and there are a number of errors, but nothing that would upset the game balance or cause any campaign problems. There are some better guides available detailing weapons for D20 Modern style games, that being said you would be well served with the Ultramodern Firearms guide if you run a modern campaign."
3,good content but Kindle version alert,The various forms checklists etc are reproduced in teeny tiny itsy bitsy type that my device can't enlarge . If you're going to take on the program pop for the physical paper and ink version.
1,SORRY THAT I PURCHASED THIS BOOK,"I have bought Heather Van Vorous' books regarding IBS -- They are fantastic and I thought that buying THIS book would give additional help! The book is virtually useless. . . The biggest negative about this book was the advice on loading up on wheat fiber -- which can cause horrible reactions in IBS patients! In addition, this team could not have researched the reaction of people with IBS to dairy products -- including yogurt -- Be smart and buy Heather Van Vorous' books -- they are simply wonderful and will help manage this condition!"
5,An important sociological and historical document,This is a work which gives insight into Jewish communal life in the Middle Ages.
5,Beautiful and very emotional,"I love all the pieces on this CD. They are lyrical and emotive- they pull at your ""heart strings."" I wish these musicians would go on tour."
3,Be aware! This is a compilation DVD,"It is a compilation of workouts from two previously released titles: Three 10-min segments from Bikini Body Camp Transforming: Kickboxing, Sculpt, Conditioning Skills/Drills and three 5-min. mini workouts from Bikini Body Camp Redefining: Blast,Upper Body Workout, Ab Workout - collagevideo.I gave it a three star rating because the editorial review does not mention the compilation, some people like these types and some don't. I have both of the mentioned DVDs and would have been very upset to find that Power Burn Express does not have new Lisa Wheeler workouts."
2,Does it work,My dog has hip arthritis. Gets the prescribed amount every day. Haven't really seenany improvement
2,Daughter of Witches,"The characters are archtypical, The poor slave girl with hidden powers, the mean master, the street urchin, the gentle mage, the female mercenary dressed as a boy who is ""partners with a male mercenary. Finally there is the Evil lustful priest that manages to find the slave girl coincidentally at every turn. There is a lot of sitting around whining and bickering and the mage won't or can't use her powers half of the time. Then suddenlly she will, or is able to use her powers. I would say the book is juvenile but I am not going to suggest it to my children."
5,Daughter of witches,Enjoyed the book immensely. Good read for any age who likes fantasy. Would like to continue the adventure with these charters. Excellent.
4,Good Book -- very enjoyable.,"I enjoyed reading this book. The murder in the beginning caught your attention right away. The heroine searches for her identity through the entire book. Since she relied on her husband for everything, she did not know how to take care of herself anymore. I thought it was a very good book and would recommend it to anyone. It reads quickly and is fairly short."
2,Not the best,"This book was one of the weaker christian books I have read recently. My major complaint was that the plot was extremely predictable from the very beginning of the book.The only one good thing about the book were the author's descriptions of the Holocaust. The use of these characters who experienced the Holocaust was successful and the description of the museum in DC was phenomenal. But because this wasn't the major part of the plot, it didn't make the book an excellent one. It also didn't seem to be woven in very well with the plot.The book also lacks content in spirituality. One review called her use of christianity ""subtle."" But I found it almost non-existant.I find that my review differs from most of the others'. But I hope it will be helpful to someone."
5,Great sound,"You cant compare the sound you get out of this system especially in this price range. Great unit many inputs and a good mellow sub woofer, fills the room at half volume."
4,amazing product,product is great for the price..the sound surpassed my old receiver.the only thing i wished i had known b-4 buying it doesn't have a HDMI for hook up to a dvd or tv.
4,Nice receiver but not a home theater system,"On the plus side:The receiver is very easy to set up. The system menu allows for programming the sound output to less than 5 speakers.On the negative side:The receiver is a little on the bulky side. Plus, I would call this a receiver not a home theater system. There are connections for multiple components but as received it is only a receiver and speakers."
4,Good for Child's Room,"I was happy when I found this because my son's tv is silver. I bought one previously for my two smaller children and loved it. This definitely puts the tv out of reach and creates more floor space. I do wish it had a shelf/bracket to hold the cable box but I am going to have to buy one seperate. I was missing the ball shaped part for the bottom which hides a screw. I blame that on the seller though because the packaging was open when we received it. It's not too bad without it, it just would have finished the look! Excellent product if it has all the fixings!!"
3,Smaller than thought,"I purchased these to replace my old transom u bolts on my boat. I guess either I didnt pay enough attention, or bought them on a whim. But they are a little small in diameter fo bolt size. I wish they were a bit larger and came with two washer brackets vs the one. All in all, a good piece, I just ordered the wrong one."
5,The Best of a long line of trucking games,SCS has hit a Homerun with this game. It's another great addition to a fairly long line of trucking games. I have played most of them and have to say this game is the best yet. I'm very impressed with the graphics. And gameplay is very smooth. You have to have a Fairly good computer to fully enjoy this game but if you do you won't be sorry you bought this game.I am running it with a 2.20 GHz. processer 200 GB hard drive and 512 MB ram. So if you have same or over what i have you should get a good experience. Good Work SCS software.
3,Average Much,"The game has a good idea going, but it needs a lot of work. I gave it three stars because the game really did just about average out for me, the gameplay had a good theme, but there was no story, or background. The graphics weren't terrible, but they were a little dated looking for my tastes(reminiscent of midtown madness 2). The realism factor wasn't nearly what i thought it would be. Steering with a wheel was more difficult that with the keyboard, and the traffic lighting/criminal system is way unfair. I got ticketed multiple times for running orange lights, and for people running into me.Other than those issues, the game was actually relatively fun to play, for a while."
2,BOOO,as soon as you finish a mission it send to back to the main Menue you can not contiue. i WOULd not recomend this product i just bought it
4,haulin,"well i own hard truck,hardtruck2, 18 wheels of steel and petal to the metal.Ididnt buy Convoy because i thought Haulin was newer and i have to say that each one is better than the last.Hope Long Haul is even better!"
2,newer not always better,"keyboard controls not as easy to drive as they could be compaired to older games. truck movement is choppy comparied to other games that i own and use on same computer. glad i got for a cheap price, buy used if you can and save some cash on this one"
3,gotta be a trucker to really enjoy this game.,"For the price the game is not bad, but if you are not a trucker looking to kill time, or if you do not want to pursue a career in trucking you might want to hold on to your $$$ and just download the demo and play that."
2,Horrible!,"I used to like this game but now its bad, no controller support or anything. Maybe for the price its not bad but.."
3,A little glitch here and there but fun.,"Graphics are not superb, They are alright for playing though. There are several scenes throughout the game and I think that it serves its purpose for the price. Because of the constant glitches, I uninstalled it. Other than that, play it you might have a different experience."
2,Iffy,"Short & sweet.The graphic are much more that I thought they were going to be. Still no people on the street.The game options are on the limited side, as in I could only have the keyboard for controls & only 2 out of 5 options on my mouse.As probably stated in other reviews, you have to figure things out for yourself (no instructions to guide you unless you look it up on the net). You are shown what your keyboard controls are & they are simular to 18 Wheels Steel Pedal to the Metal.To be personally honest, even though the graphics are not as great, I like the options available on 18 Wheels Steel Pedal to the Metal & more user friendly (although it leaves a lot to be desired).In short: if you are looking for decent graphics, more realistic actions/movements & if you like to figure things out, this is a game you will like."
3,18 Wheels of Steel....Haulin,"Game is pretty slow paced and thats not so bad. It says it supports steering wheels and pedals....well thats not true. I use a TSW2 Modified ""expensive"" wheel and the game doesnt completely support it. The maps are kind of worthless on showing which way to go and so on. I guess its a good game for younger kids and not old retired truckers."
5,Everything I needed it to be!,"This bag is great. I am able to fit everything I need in it to take it to class - my laptop, the cords, my books, a notebook or two, pens and pencils, and even some food (small, of course). It fits my 17"" laptop perfectly. And all the little pockets are great! I would definitely recommend this bag for anyone having difficulty finding something to put their oversized laptop in"
1,Totally untrue,"It's amazing to me to see books like this come out, and like lemmings going over a cliff, liberals line up to say how great it is. I wonder if there is any concern for the thousands of police officers killed or wounded every year. Probably not. Most of the people who buy garbage like this are white ""educated"" folks who probably feel guilty over being caucasion. It's very easy to avoid problems with the police, don't screw up !! But instead we'll continue to tie cops hands and second guess their every move. But the ones doing the second guessing would be too afraid to do an officers job. How ironic. In closing, the book is junk and just more propaganda from the fringe left who hate any kind of authority. It would be better to take the $20 you would spend on this trash and donate it to your local FOP. Support law enforcement !!!"
1,Disgusting,"This entire book is disgusting. The facts are skewed in every case to favor the CRIMINAL. Folks, when someone has a gun and has hurt someone else or is threating to hurt a cop, HE IS A CRIMINAL. Favorable reviews of this book are disturbing. Remember who you call when you need help. Remember who you call when a drunk kills your wife on the highway. Remember who you call when your sister gets raped. Remember who you call when you are in 7-11 and a meth-head robs the place and kills your daughter. You call police. You call them because WE do something you can't. Serve and protect. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"
1,"repetition, repetition, repetition (but no insight)","When I purchased this book, I thought that it would be an interesting exploration of people like myself--urban professionals who are in their late 20s and early 30s and unmarried and childless. Instead, I found a dreadfully boring account of the author's tepid exploration of this cultural trend. He didn't seem quite interested in the topic himself--just kind of aimless, self-absorbed and bored enough to wonder. This half-hearted soul searching was repeated over and over with little insight, fostering a very frustrating sense of vague deja vu. Please, people. He is not the spokesman for my generation."
3,"Great text book potential, but ugh... boring ""fun"" read.","This book seemed to be a long drawn out version of the article the author wrote as the basis for this book. The first few chapters were interesting, but about 3/4 of the way through the book I just had to close it for good.This book would be great as a text book as it would be interesting to hear students? perspectives of the concepts, but as a ""fun read"" I would not recommend it."
1,Blow harder,"Self indulgent self justification, anyone? This ""analysis"" of a ""social trend"" is focused on the thinnest demographic slice of our nation's population. If you're a member of the bohemian bourgeoisie and a fan of the poppiest pop-psych, you may see your own reflection here and enjoy the view, which is gracefully etched. But if you're looking for insight about the world around you, search elsewhere. This book will leave you empty handed and gasping for air."
1,"culture defined, but not much more","This book looks very exciting and very promising. It may have started out as a great idea, but there is just nothing to read in it. There is absolutely nothing new. Yes, when people leave home and get jobs they have friends before they get married. There is almost no research beyond his descriptions of a few ""urban tribes"" that feel like they are part of some crazy new phenomenon. In one section where he tries to get philosophical, rather than researching actual philosophers, he actually paraphrases high school papers he found on Google (with no citation at all). Then he has the audacity to criticize them. "" Much of what [Aristotle] came up with was unremarkable"". After the first chapter, every word is a repetition of the same description of a group that is tolerant, urban and likes to have a good time. Frankly, I've never felt the need to write a review of a book until now, and I want my money back."
5,This man holds nothing back,"I bought this book a couple years ago and still remember most of the details. The thing that stands out about this book is Kirk's transparency. He is to the point where he is brutally honest about his life and his walk with the Lord. I identified with his pain and hurt that he experienced as a child. My heart ached for him as he dealt with loneliness and rejection for only wanting to be who he was.He is definitely real about his experiences. This should be an inspiration to all Christians who try to hide behind the mask of being perfect. This book showed me that I can be honest with God , others, and myself."
5,God is well and alive,"The book is about a young boy who got adopted at the age of three. He was exsposed to a lot of gangs, violence,drugs, and sew when he was growing up. He mother was an old elderly lady whao adopted him when she was in her late seventies. She took ccare of him the best way she knew how and gave him everything he needed even if she had to sacrafice. This book was really inspirational to myself. It helped me to understand more about god and how he works in mysterious ways. Kirk uses his singing and musically ablity to help minster to young people. This basically about how the lord works in mysterious ways and if you want to be with the lord just trust in him and you will reign with him forever."
1,Dreadful,"I love Kirk Franklin's music. So does he - and he seems to love himself even more! Not only does this book drip of self-praise and egotism, it rings loudly of homophobia. Of all the horrible things that might have happened to Kirk as a kid (and he doesn't really tell you any!) the worst, in his mind, seems to be that he was called a queer. Give me a break.Kirk glosses over details, and pretty much everyone outside of his immediate, current, family have no names listed at all.Don't waste your time AND your money. Buy a CD and be thankful that its ok to love the message and not the messenger!"
3,Typical Autobiography,"I've been reading testimonies or autobiographies of people who became Christians and even like in this case, notable Christians and entertainers--and this one is like all of them. It's all very interesting until they come to the Lord, then it's a lot of preaching against everything THEY did previously. I'm not necessarily condemning them, but it's typical. That is the Christian life, to leave the things of this world in the past, but it sure seems more fun to be a sinner. All comments or joking aside.....I love people who find and love and serve the Lord. Praise God for Kirk Franklin. Like the others, he just has feet of clay like all the rest of us."
5,Excellent Autobiography on a Talented Man of God,"Kirk Franklin is one of the most talented and anointed songwriters I've ever heard of. To me, he's the absolute best. In this autobiography, Kirk takes you back to his childhood days. He also talks about what occurred between then and 1998 (when the book was published). -A lot has happened since then, so maybe he should write a continuation. Kirk tells it like it is in this book... there's no holding back. I think that people are sometimes scared of the truth and Kirk brings the truth like no one else. That is why he gets so much flack from folk. People should search their hearts and start focusing on the truth that God wants them to see. Truth that He can show them through a book or someone's life story. Give this book a chance -- it is definitely worth the read!"
1,GOD IS GOOD ALL THE TIME SAINTS,WE'LL I THINK THAT GOD IS GOOD ALL THE TIME SO I FEEL THAT THE BOOK WAS KIND OF GOOD SO THEREFOR I THINK THAT YALL SHOULD KEEP ON PRAISING HIM BECAUSE IN MATTHEW 34:2 HE SAID I WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU AND NEVER FAINT.
3,Does the job,"OK, overall stable, and light, but did leave scratches on the tubing when i tightened it to where I thought it was secure. I also felt that when I did tighten it (on the upper part of the tuning slide, it actually constricted the slide slightly. Positives were it did not move like the clamp on variety, and was not as heavy (bell heavy) as the bell attached type."
5,Cool Tools- The 2004 edition whole earth minilog,"An amazing collection of useful stuff and ideas. From digital gadgets to cultural insights. The comments about the print quality are missing the point. This isn't a design tome, it's a reference guide. A fascinating guide for explorers of life on earth."
3,"great at times, just not at others","The tech metal scene seems to have been exploding over the past few years and this is another addition to it. Some have been comparing it to the red chord which I do not believe is a fair comparison.The Red Chord is tech because they love tech metal. Glass Casket is tech because they just really want to be tech. You can hear that there are many phrases on the CD that are uninspired and thrown in to transition the song from one section to the next.But isn't that what tech is? To a point, yes. But not with this kind of predictability. Randomness is the friend of tech (not complete chaos, there is still enough struction for it not to lose focus.) Many times you are just sitting around waiting for a great breakdown to kick in and in half the songs, it doesn't happen.BUT! There is a positive side. At least half the album is fantastic (first song and the last 4) and I see no room for improvement on these 5 tracks. The other 4 you can look over and not think about them."
4,a reminder.,I hear a lot of complaining that these guys sound like Between the Buried and Me. I just wanted to remind these folks that a good chunk of BTBAM is now comprised of members of Glass Casket.
3,Pretty cool first listen...then gets a little tiresome,"this band is basically Dillinger Escape Plan, only a little less chaotic...and more song oriented. I almost wanted to buy it, but then I realized I can only take so much of it before wanting to find something else to listen to. Something about it just makes me get bored after a few minutes. Definitely aggressive and heavy though...so I'm sure some people will eat it up."
4,Another good band from the Abacus label,"I heard ""Fisted and Forgotten"" while listening to Xtreme Metal Radio on live365.com. I got to say I was impressed. This is what Metalcore is all about. I am glad I was introduced to this band from this station. A couple weeks later I picked up this album. From begining to end nothing but pure metal agression for your ears. Don't let the smaller bands go unnoticed. Do yourself a favor and pick up this album today."
4,Great Stuff,"I just found out about this band. And they are awesome, fans of BTBAM, Aria, Red Chord should love this band"
4,BUY THIS,this cd is wild!!this band needs to go on tour so I can quit my job and follow them or something
4,really comprehensive book,This was just what I was looking for. All information necessary for someone looking to work at the weather market
2,Pointed knife works better,I have an old Tekna Micro knife that is no longer available that I have been using to clean under my nails. I thought that something designed specifically for cleaning under nails might do a better job. It doesn't.
2,Mehaz Professional Curette Nail Cleaner,I expected the curette nail cleaner cups to have thinner and sharper edges so they would easily clean between the nail and skin on the side of the toe. So I am not overly impressed with the product.
2,Nothing Special,"Had to get this for a class I was taking (one of the authors being my teacher) and it just seems so basic. Now, they were trying to elaborate on how instinct works in film and maybe what they say works for others, but to me a lot of it is simply not how I work.Just my perspective, if others find it useful then that's good."
4,It's so *large*!,"I bought two of these, thinking I'd place them in some of my flower pots. Uh, no. They're huge! It's a bit hard to get any perspective from the photo, but imagine that that pot it's shown in is a large pot made to be placed on the floor with, for example, a bush or small tree in it. It absolutely won't fit in, for example, my miniature rose pots: It's as big as my miniature rose plants.The waterer itself is great, it's very attractive and from what I can tell it'll do the job well. (My grandmother used very similar but smaller plant waterers for her african violets with great success.) It's just rather large, so you should consider buying it if you have rather large plants that could use a nice watering device."
5,POWERFUL!,"This book has everything. An artful blend of action, Scottish warriors, time travel, humor, and most of all compassion and justice. It has helped me see I am a good person and I can fight back against abuse. Can't wait for the second book to be out."
5,Fun & Imaginative,"My 2yr old son loves this book. It rhymes and is fun to read. My son has a blast as we chase the blue spot throught the pages. It is interactive in that way and he really enjoys it each time we read it. I would recommend this book for children 2-4 years old. It is simple, fun, imaginative and interactive."
5,If you're looking for a page-turner...,"you just found it. Ms. Leavitt has written another beautifully realistic tale of love and love lost. She has a rare talent to put the reader into the hearts and minds of her characters. In this story, you experience adoption from all angles - from the 16 year old birth mom, her out of touch parents, as well as the adoptive parents who have the best of intentions. I love the honesty of this book - it's not a fairy tale, but a wonderful glimpse of real life - warts and all. Be sure to have your tissue box handy!"
3,Could be a shorter story...,"Plus points: great characterization of the adoptive parents, child and relationship between them; great writing on how the open-adoption goes down-the-hill. Minus points: repetitive in the characterization of the parents of Sarah, the birth mother: no in-depth reasons why they want Sarah to have the baby adopted, just the same overall ""keep your eyes in the future"".Another point that should be mentioned: the story follows the characters for more than 18 years - the first half of the book centers around Sarah, the ""vanishing"" boyfirend/father and the birth of the adoptive child - before and after. Character development in this part of the book is better strutctured than in the last half."
5,Read this book!!!,"Girls in Trouble was one of the best, most engrossing novels I have read in a while. The pain felt by both Sara and Eva and George is so real I could feel a heavyness in my chest while I read this book (even sneaking a quick page or two at work). Several parts broke my heart, but it was a pretty real idea book. Not much sugar coating. The only think I sort of secretly wished was for Sara to have been able to gotten back together....call me a hopeless romantic fool. R"
5,Gripping and beautifully told story,"Caroline Leavitt's writing is so full of life and passion that I was swept along on the wave of every sentence. This is a deeply intelligent, heartbreakingly moving novel of family intersections , of growing up, of learning hard lessons, and most of all, the infinite possibilities of love. Leavitt is in top form here."
4,A great book for a group discussion,"I couldn't put this book down once I got started. I was so drawn into the characters. Caroline Leavitt has a gift for making her characters so real, full of flaws and human emotions. This, along with the topic of teen pregancy and the consequences that follow give a discussion group plenty to talk about. Sara, could be anyones daughter. She is smart, ambitious and she is in love. Your heart will break as you watch her struggle coming to terms with life, love and loss. You will feel the desperation in a childless couples life and what extreme they will go to to protect their dream come true. You will feel the sadness and failure of Sara's parents as they struggle with the impossible act of trying to forget. In the end, it is a book that opened my eyes to the selflessness and gift of adoption. I highly recommend it."
4,Interesting to see both sides,"It was an especially interesting book since you were seeing it from the sides of the birth mother and the adopted mother. They had such a close and special relationship before the baby, you hated to see it be destroyed by the impulsive act of Sara, the birth mother. I liked that it actually carried you through the years that followed so that you would get to see the consequences and the changes that occurred with everyone. The voices and emotions in this book were very real. I really enjoyed this book and how it ended."
2,Slow and Boring,"I love other Lori Copeland books, have read 5 or 6 of them, think they are funny, entertaining, well written, and I read for the christian content too, but this book just doesn't have it!! I don't know what happened, but I'm not through with it yet, and am not sure I can finish it, it is so boring, without an interesting plot. If you haven't read other Lori Copeland's books, try one from another series!!!!!"
1,Buyers Beware of Evangelization,"I am a fan of mystery novels. Although I had not heard of Lori Copeland, I purchased this book based on the information provided on Amazon.com. I found the heavy christian themes very off putting. I read Andrew Greeley novels but they are not as heavy handed as this. Of course an author has the right to use any style they wish, but my real complaint is with the publisher and Amazon for not properly portraying this novel. If you are looking for a christian-centered mystery, this may be a book for you. However, if you find christian spirituality and themes offensive, avoid this book. I couldn't finish the book because the christian themes were just too strong."
1,Someone tell me why this story got good reviews?,"I am an avid reader! When I saw this book at a used bookstore I became excited! I had heard wonderful things about the author and I was looking forward to reading this story. What a sad, disappointing, slow, and overall awful book! The main character is so shallow and flat it was hard to get through the pages. I don't know a mother who would let her 30-year-old daughter come home and waste her life away eating. Oh and well I'm am on the subject of eating, why did the author put so much into what the characters ate. She even described in great detail the kinds of cereal. Also there was a lot of talk about the pets. I didn't care about a dog that died or a cat that decided to run the household. I was saddened by how lonely Maude was at first until I realized that it was her own fault. At least Stella had a bridge club to attend. I will not be finishing this series, and I am not sure if I ever want to pick up another story by this author again."
1,Whine Whine Whine,"Ugh, this was one of the worst books I have ever listened to. I listened for about about 30 minutes and just could not bear the whiney poor pitiful me tone of the main character Maude-more like Moaning Maude. Deleted immediately from my Ipod and threw away the disk."
2,Book better than DVD,"I bought the CDs and the book. I liked the book but demonstrations in the video, with all due respect, lacks some technical value. I wouldn't recommend this CD for practical purposes."
2,This game needs help!,"When I received this game I was excited about it as the screenshots online looked very realistic. Playing this game, I found this game needed some work on the physics of car crashes. The impact of the vehicles weren't realistic at all, the collisions felt more like you were playing bumper cars than experiencing a real crash between two vehicles. The guns and missles add a certain arcade style to this game I did not like. Some tracks are difficult to maneveur around as well. All in all I think they need to hit the drawing board on this one and take some notes from a solid game like ""Flatout 2"", which is a much more impressive game to play than this title."
2,Satellite dish cover,This was a last ditch effort to receive good reception during inclement weather. Alas the desire was better than the product results. I just didn't work out well for me fighting rain reception. I even tried to spray copious amounts of silicone rain repellent on the cover to help it out and still it didn't work. For anyone having this trouble I suggest going to HD Satellite which so far has provided reception in rain and snow without the need for this poor performing cover. Good Luck.
1,The Adventures of Topper ... Volumes 1 & 2,"While the video portion is great, the audio portion is barely understandable. On both volumes, you have to make a real effort to be able to discern what's being said."
1,It didn't work,I bought it based on the outstanding reviews i read about it . I was trying to copy my original DVDs to a VHS tape . Unfortunately it didn't work for me . The result was identical to hooking up my DVD player to my VCR and recording directly . So back in the box it went .
4,Goodbye macrovision,"Works as expected. The other controls work fairly well,but not overly so. I am pleased."
1,Doesn't work...,"With DVD recorders! That would have been a nice little piece of info to include in the description, eh?I found out the hard way, after buying the thing. Now I have to go through the trouble of returning it."
4,built like ok,"this fits and will work. in my car for 3+ years so far still working.fast ship,and product is as said it is."
3,A challenge to patience rather than mind,"Who doesn't want to improve his/her mind? So MindGym is definitely a captivating title, esp. when Brain Gym has proved its amazing efficacy. However this CD is a disappointment. You need to have a lot of time to kill before venturing into this CD. First you have to suffer through the author's assessment in enforced interaction before you can get into the locker for trying out various exercises. If you make a wrong click, you have to go through the same assessment and exercises again and again. The over-dramatic and doctrinaire voice is a bit irritating. The graphic designs and technical computer applications are good. What is most needed is some easy directions for the user's navigation to choose. That will help to salvage what is of value in the games, puzzles and drills. Otherwise, the money and time invested would be much better spent on learning and practising Paul Dennison's Brain Gym instead."
3,Good mind puzzle entertainment,"Many of the puzzles were challenging, but a few were just a little too out there. Overall, it was pretty good for all of us mind puzzle fanatics!"
3,It could have been much better,"I really like the music on this album but, in my opinion, the singer is so bad she totally ruins this album. With a good singer, this album could have easily earned 5 stars from me. I don't like to sound of her voice, and the accent is very very heavy (as described by another reviewer)."
3,"You can get them cheaper at your local dollar store, apparently","i bought this stuff online, and when i got it i was pretty pleased. it smells alright compared to a more expensive cologne, perhaps a bit more than what you pay for, but dont buy it online. as soon as i bought it my friend told me he found the same stuff in a dollar store for cheaper than i had got it on here."
2,Smells like coast soap,It's ok but don't smell like Aqua Di Gio at all but lasts much longer. More like coast soap if you know what that smells like. Just a little cheap smelling. You get what you pay for.
1,Good selection - bad recordings,"The good thing: this CD has all the recordings I was looking for by Bobby Rydell. The bad thing: the recordings are very poor. The 2 CDs I purchased (one from Amazon and one from another source) have problems like: skips, short repeats, long outages, and poor sound quality on some songs. It gets so bad that I can't even listen to the whole CD, either one. My CD player does not correct for CD errors. What is there is what I hear. This is one CD I would avoid if possible."
2,i'm sorry but this book friggin' sucked,"i still dont know what it was about. no real plot at all. and the back of the book... false advertising to the fullest. it made you think that she was this bad boy get money chick but thats not the case. i mean if this was a lifetime movie, i might of liked it, but becasue i was expecting a street novel and got lmn movie of the week i was mad. the only reason this book got two star instead of the one was simply because this would truly be a good lifetime movie."
4,I Enjoyed It,"I liked this particular story because I enjoyed how the characters met in high school. It is unique in that most stories will introduce the characters as adults and then go back in time with ""flash backs"". The author did a good job with making sure all the characters had a role in the story so each character is used really well. I recommend this book to those who are inspired by characters going through tough times and finding that rainbow at the end. This book definitely has that element."
4,True Butterfly,"I usually do not read TCP books but decided to go against the grain. Black was actually very good to say the least I am very impressed.Kaia deals with the struggles of being a black sheep in her own house. At an early age she realizes that she is not her mother's favorite daughter and witnesses tragedy at the hands of her mother. What should have brought them closer only edged them farther apart. After meeting Aaron, Kaia feels safe and secure until yet another tragedy leaves her lonely and pregnant. If she can't count on anyone she knows that she has her friends. But Kaia also realizes that when tragedy strikes you see who your real friends are.Can Kaia get over the wedge between her and her mother? Can she provide love and support to her baby all by herself? Will jealousy ruin a childhood friendship?"
5,Tracy is one of the best,I felt this story. I got this one from my friend at school and I couldnt put it down. Just ordered another one by her. This was a nice story and I havent read nothing this good in a while.
3,IT WAS OKAY,I thought the book was just okay. All the lovey dovey stuff made the book kind of long. I liked how Aaron tried to put it down for his girl and took responsiblity. Kiara moms was off the hook. I think the book is a good read but i can recommend several better. B-More Careful -Tru to the Game-A project Chick- and of course the coldest winter ever and if you got time check out whoreson by donald goines peace and happy reading
3,Entertaining,"This book started out being really good, but towards the middle to end, some things became alittle unbelievable. I didnt like the way it ended, but all in all it was okay..."
3,Again,Another story about another black woman waiting for her drug dealer boyfriend to get out of prison. If you want to read a book about a woman who takes control of her own life. Read B-more careful by Shannon Holmes.
3,not used to good books,i read a lot... about 2 books a week. now i got great reviews on this book.. it was just okay... i didnt do anything for me.. i think some people have been deprived of good books cuz this book needed more work.
3,Not all That!!!!!!!!!,The book started off pretty good then towards the end it just wasn't interesting any more. It needed more drama .
4,A Great Story!!!,"I would read the reviews from other readers and wondered how this book could be so good and how the story was so moving and now i know....This is not your typical urban street book. It has a good story line and makes you love the main characters. It shows you what a mother should be like through Kaia and no matter how many obstacles that come your way, you have to keep going because that's what strong women do. It is an excellent story that will make you laugh and cry."
4,Princess Meets Her Prince,"Blackis a story of Kaia Wesley who faces different adversities in the homefront growing up. With a mother who despises her and a father who adored her, Kaia life became even more complicated when she witnesses her fathers death.Budding into a beautiful teenager, Kaia meets Aaron who falls head over heels in love with her and she with him. Finally having that sense of security and love that she deserves another hindrance arises that leaves her pregnant and alone to fend for herself. With the help and advice of her friends Kaia comes to stand on her own.When one of her so-called friends betrays her, she will then find out who her real friends are. As the saying goes ""Keep your friends close and enemies closer"".This novel will make you laugh, cry, and angry. Tracey Brown did a great job, minus the few grammatical errors that I came across throughout the book. I recommend Black to everyone, the young and the old, just simply wonderful.TangerineReader's Paradise Book Club"
5,OMG,Oh My GOD! What a fantastic book. I actually sat and cried as I read this book. Tracy Brown you have surpassed the others to me. I loved every single minute of reading when I read this book; it is definately a page turner. Keep up the good work!
4,Page Turner,I really liked this book; the storyline was great. Janice needed her behind kicked for being so cruel to her daughter. It's sad to say that that type of stuff happens in our world today. I would recommend this book to anyone especially teens.
4,Pretty Good Book,"I have read a lot of books about young black girls that was raised in the streets and came from broken homes,but this book was exceptional. It actually made me feel the emotions that the main character was going through. The only bad part about the book was that it that long and it had me wanting to know more details. But overall it was good book and it only took me a day to read it."
4,Real Love,"If you dont get to read this book it wont be a loss. However, the love between Kaia and Aaron is heartwarming. The struggles of being a young mom with no family support will make you think about how ""hard"" your life really is. The display of sisterhood was very strong. Good read."
5,THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD!!!!,"This book was so good. I have read a lot of books and kaia was right when she said never judge a book by its cover cause I just knew that Black was gonna be the typical drug dealing, black on black crime, baby mama drama book. I really enjoyed reading this book. I went through every emotion reading Black. I laughed, I cried, shoot I wanted to jump in the book and whoop Giselle ass my damn self! Black really gave me inspiration to love myself more, love those close to me more, and of course love life more. Tracy you did a damn good job with this one. Keep it up!!!"
2,black,"The item was in good condition but Triple Crown Publications has put out some of the worst garbage for literature that I have every read. The story line is ok but every page in the book has a typo, spelling, or gramatical error."
3,Great story - fast read,I loved this story. This book was a quick read for me. Took me only a few hours because I couldn't put it down. The storyline was good and the action kept me turning the pages.
4,A Hip-Hop Love Story,"This was an enjoyable book, I must commend Tracy Brown on Black. It was a true ""hip-hop"" love story. Tracy pens a story of young lovers (Aaron and Kaia) who through trails and tribulations stick together and learn from their mistakes. Purchase this one, you won't be disappointed."
2,Just okay,"I've read her other book White Lines and that one was extremely well written. However, this one was just blah. I think that she didn't have many ideas to make a great story. I did not purchase this book so I suggest you borrow it if you can. The book started off good but it fell apart in the middle and the end."
5,"BRAVO, TRACY","THIS BOOK WAS THE BOMB, FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST PAGE. DEFINENTLY A PAGE TURNER. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY ONE WHO READS AND TO THOSE WHO DONT. ONCE YOU START YOU WILL BE LOOKING FOR MORE."
5,This book was off the hook I give it 10 stars,All I HAVE TO SAY IS GO PICK A COPY OF THIS BOOK AND SEE FOR YOUR SELF.
4,A solid but underrated album by the big D,"Most people are way to harsh with this album, sure is not as powerful as the previous but, co'mon Deliverance released two gems in a row, few bands ever do that. Even when they themselves have said that it was ""rushed"" is still very good. Many dont like the 5 second ""songs"" and the references to food and cooking but is just the band been silly and goofy. Other have done it before, i remember an album called Bedtime for Democracy by Dead Kennedys I heard eons ago, it had like 30 tracks and most were just scraps of noise, drumming and the band making jokes mixed with punk rock.This released contains the original album completely remastered, i have a 20 year old tape, I can tell you the sounds is way better.To close it up, if you like Deliverance get it, is a worthy successor to their previous albums."
2,Disappointed,"My grandson didn't like this game. But in all fairness, perhaps he is a little too young for it. Not quite 4, he didn't have the patience it took to catch a fish. It's a cute idea, but I think the manufacturer needs to make it a little eaiser to ""hook"" something. Even I got bored with coming up with nothing. More small fish in the sea would solve the problem."
5,Solid purchase,I use them for soccer practice vests. They are heavy duty and worth the price. I am happy with my purchase.
1,One bag for $13.29???,"The picture shows 4 bags, so, naturally, I thought there would be 4 in the shipment. Wrong! My order from Amazon arrived today, and it contained 1 bag! Seriously? This must be some bag, but I wanted 4. Call me unhappy, and expect a return."
5,Fantastic Documentary,Wow. What a fantastic documentary about service dogs and the wonderful people that are blessed to share their love with them. This was such an inspirational show and I highly recommend it to both dog lovers and those interested in witnessing how dogs can postively impact physically impaired people's lives.
5,Amazing!!!!,This was an awesome PBS documentary. It was amazing to see all the hard work that goes into service dogs; from both the trainers and their new owners.
1,No Nude Scenes,I thought it would be a sexy peanut butter orgy from the POV of a dog with some real cute kids. I was wrong.
1,Robber barons writing children's books?,"I found this book to be appallingly outdated. The Mellopsdrill for oil in the forest while the mom cheerfully ""practicesout door cooking"" and then all must flee when a passing motorist carelessly sets a forest fire. This book, written in 1958 when Standard Oil was king and women were third class citizens, is 1950s pulp and remains in the past--not on any child's bookshelf. Although it could serve as a good example of how far society has come in understanding and environmental awareness."
5,Nice Book,"I really like this book. It provides good information, and is very helpful. There are various patterns in the book, which allow you to increase your skills as you go along. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and look forward to learning many things from this book."
4,Very helpful,This is such a nice book..you can tell is made with love and gives you great ideas to knit..I actually bought it for me I want to learn how to knit and then teach my little girl.I like it.
2,Maybe it's just me??,"Maybe it's just me. I usually catch on pretty quickly with most anything in a creative sense, but knitting just doesn't seem to be one of the things I am able to do well. I have checked out book after book from my library and no help. I've studied tutorials online and no help. So I bought this book thinking if it were written for children and got such rave reviews from grown ups as well, then maybe it would help me! No such luck! The directions seemed pretty easy, but I guess I am a visual learner and the pictures just didn't seem to help me out at all!! It also seemed like it was thrown together awkwardly. I don't know, but I'm glad I bought it used and only paid a total of about 6 dollars for it!! It was a let down from the reviews I read on amazon before buying it!!"
1,Not for Left - Handed People!,If your left - handed this book is NOT for you. I thought a lot of the projects were to advanced for beginners.
2,the knitting/purling method is overly complicated,"I'm surprised that no-one has commented on the overly complicated knitting/purling method used in this book.The book shows only one way to make a knit/purl stitch, and it's slow and torturous. You insert the right needle into the stitch as you normally would when knitting or purling, but then you hold the point where the needles intersect, pick up the working yarn with your free hand and wind it around the needle. Then you pick up both needles again and complete the stitch as usual. This method would frustrate any child, enough to get them to stop knitting altogether."
5,It's has fun projects and good instructions,I made a teddy bear for my sister...and i BEARly knew how to knit before I tried. I love the projects and there easy to follow.
5,"Great Book, Easy To Follow","I bought this book to teach myself how to knit. After a couple practice squares, I've spent the past couple months working on my first patchwork afghan.This book is very easy to follow. As someone in there mid 20s, I felt bad that I did not have someone in my life growing up that knew how to knit. Many children's books on the market are great because they are easy to read and they have colorful pictures. When I read so many good reviews about this book, I knew I should giving knitting a try!Although I felt silly buying a book for kids, I have to admit that this is one of the best instruction books I own. I highly recommend it for anyone learning how to knit on their own!"
5,Hubby and I laughed until we cried,It's refreshing to read a pregnany book that actually addresses the common complaints of pregnancy with a sense of humor. I couldn't put it down and will enjoy re-reading it -- and giving it to friends and family who are expecting.
2,Not What I Had in Mind,"I bought this book because someone recommended her kid wrangeling book and as I am newly pregnant I figured I would start with Bun in the Oven. The book starts with the author laying out her pregnancy history in a diary format and she explains all the negative things going on with pregnancy. She was drinking and smoking a week after conception because she didn't know she was pregnant, but she had been trying to get pregnant, so I don't know why she wasn't being cautious.The author recommends some other pregnancy books to read if you are pregnant and I would guess that they would better for a ""first"" book to read when you find out you are pregnant. This might be an amusing book to read if you already feel you know everything you need to know. The authors negative attitude about her pregnancy was a real turn off and there was no where near the amount of information on the pregnancy that I was expecting. I will not be finishing this book."
4,Mechanical Aptitude & Spatial Relations Test,It is an excellent publication which will be put to good use within our organisation.
1,never received book,"i never received this book, it got lost in the mail, although the seller has agreed to reimburse me 100%. i would do business with them again, they were quick to answer emails and kept me informed of my options."
3,Its ok,"This book delivers what it says, but really is no help to you if you have any kind of education. Most of these tests have questions like ""6+3=?""or have two people sitting on one side of a hammock, and it asks which side is holding more weight. It's not really anything you can study for. If anything, get this book to flip through it so you know what to expect; it's cheap so you don't really have anything to lose."
1,Fancy title but no real substance,"I read other people's reviews for this book before I purchased it,so based on that I bought the book. Now that I bought, I honestly do not recommend it to anyone. The book starts with questions and multiple choice answers for everything then you find the answers a few pages later.There are no explanations for the answers or how the stuff works.Basically it is a look and memorize book without any theory of operation or coaching on how things work. The paper is cheap and the fonts are small, hard to read. Instructions are confusing. I do not recommend it at all."
2,hmmm,this is not a needed purchase for the afoqt. there are only a few pages pertaining to anything found on the test.
4,Okay But feels different,"I loved the first season of Tsubasa but this season feels a little different. The animation seems a little different, simpler, and the episodes a little shorter. It also feels like they are hurrying the story line, going through a different world all in one episode so you don't really get attached to the minor characters."
2,Not much more,"I debated whether to keep this ""study guide"" or to return it for a refund. I expected it to be similar to an AP study guide; it does not contain much more than what you can find on the ETS Praxis website. There are only 12 sample test questions on-line, whereas this guide does have 120, the number on an actual test. So you can practice the test with a 2 hour time limit, simulating the test conditions. And if the questions cover the scope of the ""real"" test, it would give you an idea of what areas you need to study more."
2,"Unfortunately, not much here","I just purchased the downloadable version from ETS. You'd expect more from a study guide put together by the same people who created the test. It claims to be 90+ pages, but between all the blank pages and rehash of what's available on the website, it's more like 40 pages of information. There are 120 questions and the rationale for their answers. That's the meat of the guide. Skimpy."
5,Great Book,"This book should be read by all teens with diabetes. I picked up this book in the Endo's office and thought it was going be a dumb boring book but once I started reading it I couldnt stop. From Topics from Food to Driving and others , This Book has things Teens With Diabetes Will need"
2,I raised myself,"What a crock of dissapointment this was!!!! This would have never been published had she not been Alice Walker's daughter. This lose collection of memories lamely tied together with a gimmicky introduction and a sermon at the end which tried to resurrect the gimmick reminded me of a child who when asked who taught her something answers ""I taught myself"". This book was demeaning to both her parents. I would have thought that by her age she would have the maturity in looking back to not just give self-centered vingettes, but also do justice to the complex relationship with both parents other than the petulant teenage ""you don't understand me, don't care about me, don't supervise me and know nothing about me"". Shame on her editor for letting her get away with this -- what you printed has the quality of a new writer's first draft. This book could have been so good but it obviously just ""wrote itself""."
1,another whining memoir by priviledged kid of famous parents,"This book is a long laundry list of complaints by an author who turned to promiscuity and drugs to deal with the usual teenage anxieties. She takes no responsibility for her poor choices. She blames all her turmoil on her genes, on her family, the culture and on and on. Hardly a role model for any struggling person trying to live with heart. The book is repetitious and pretty boring. I think the author ought to live another twenty years before writing an autobiography of any kind. SHe is just out of her twenties. And it shows."
2,If her mother weren't Alice Walker......,"This is a rather mediocre report of growing up in the 70s and 80s. I don't think it would even have been published if the author's mother weren't Alice Walker.I think the younger Ms. Walker is bright and writes well, but there is no great reason for reading this book. Unfortunately, I've never read any of the magazine articles written by Ms. Walker, but I will be looking for them."
1,Only Good for the Dish on Alice!,"Like many others have said below, boring, shallow, and only published because she is the daughter of the famous writer Alice Walker. The only redeeming feature of the book is the delicious dish on her mother. My goodness, Alice Walker certainly lives up to every horrible stereotype of the self-involved second wave feminist. The details invite a reappraisal of the meeting of the personal and the political in certain strands of feminist lit. In this sense, the book needs to be read as the latest installment, albeit somewhat less glamourous, of the ungrateful daughter's nasty tell-all genre, a la Christina Crawford and B.D. Hyman (daughter of Bette Davis). More useful as tabloid material for eggheads rather than general enlightenment."
3,Worth Reading!,"I just finished reading this book! I enjoyed reading this book, though I wish I hadn't read the reviews of the book first. I read a review that said that the only way Ms. Walker got a chance to publish this book was because she was Alice Walker's Daughter. So, that review was stuck in my head the entire time that I was reading this book. But, I do believe that it was worth reading! But, what till it comes out in Paperback,don't pay for the hardback edition!"
3,What a Voice.,"I just finished watching Rebecca Walker on C-SPAN book notes from College Park Maryland. She read several extended passages. Her honest, detailed, revealing accounts of experience and the emotions and thoughts that go with them were incredible. Perhaps the book is too full of ""poor me"" and teenage angst, I don't know. But the person who wrote it is an adult who has learned from the experiences now published. Perhaps the person who came out of that life makes the story for us. In an hour or more of reading and q&a it crossed my mind that she might be Alice Walker's daughter, but it was not clear or apparent and I believe Rebecca too is gifted with a voice that will talk to us for years to come. I can't wait to get my hands on a copy of the book!"
2,Leave the writing to her mother,"Blah blah blah! Sorry, but I was expecting so much more. Maybe I went into this book with a larger expectation for Rebecca, but this is anything but an inspiring story but more of a multi cultural child whining that she had to move a lot. Welcome to the melting pot of America, Rebecca! Be grateful :) Besides the Americana references, dont bother with this one."
2,No Profound Truths Here,"A very sad book but not for the reasons the author intends. According to Walker, she has rhythm because of her black lineage (which of course makes her incredible in bed). She can withstand the cold because of her white blood. And she is a neurotic, overanalytical mess because of her Jewish heritage. Has the dialogue about race and religion progressed so little that someone of Walker's keen intelligence would try to pass off these inanities as profound truth?"
3,Black White and Jewish,"Being biracial and the same age as Rebecca Walker, I was very interested in reading this book. I like Walker's writing, I feel she invites the reader in without pretense, but I felt the book was too disjointed. It did not flow. I was interested in reading about her early life, but it was so confusing to keep up with how old she was and where she was living. Maybe that was the point, but I felt the book could have been much better if it was more tightly put together."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting so much more from a book that deals with being biracial. I found the book shallow and was waiting for some experience she cited to make me really feel what it was like to be both black and Jewish. The only thing I felt in the end was that it was no different than being a mix of anything or even just feeling that you don't fit in, like so many teens do. A very disappointing book from a woman that I'm sure really has much more to say."
1,Certainly not what I expected,"As the mother of two bi-racial children, I bought the book to understand what it was like to be ""Black, White and Jewish"". Perhaps I was expecting too much but I didn't expect to hear of one's drug use and sexual relationships at a young age etc. I don't believe the book spoke to it's title at all."
3,"Quick read, Had some insights.","ALthough I enjoyed the writing style and some of the portrayals of her family and multi-racial experiences, I expected this book to be more about the later and her coming of age rather than the attention given to her sexual experiences. This did not seem as important to the book as the themes on racism, black/Jewish relations, etc. I would have liked more of that. It seemed like she had a lot of rebellion against her dad and his wife, but they seemed more there for her than her mom. I found this book very interesting and I would like to read more by this author and on this topic."
2,Not the universal biracial experience,"I'm also black, white and Jewish and was hoping to see myself in these pages....alas, I did not. I did relate to one or two things but for the most part, I found the book lacking.It is important for biracial literature to be out there in the marketplace but readers should note that there are many aspects of biraciality and that this book is not the universal biracial experience; particularly since she is someone of a very privileged background - daughter of a writer and a lawyer, a Yale grad, a worker on a movie set as a teenager. That's pretty rare for anyone, regardless of what race the person is.Furthermore, while she is very open about her biraciality, she is very vague about her bisexuality. Why? Perhaps that is her next book..."
2,Promise unfulfilled,"This book looked promising. At first, I didn't realize Rebecca Walker was in any way related to Alice Walker. I picked it up, because it appeared to have a multi-cultural, bi-racial theme: a story about someone growing up bi-racially and multi-culturally. I didn't realize it was going to be about the life and times of Alice Walker's daughter from her perspective as a ""movement"" child. While she probably wasn't looking for it, she did gain some sympathy from me, but in the end, I felt she was able to get a book deal because of her connections, her privileged background, and I was left empty. I did not get a real feel for who Rebecca is nor for her deeper experiences. Just as she seemed to do with those in her life, I felt she was trying to get attention with shocking tidbits of her life. This book is not a keeper. It has been passed around to a number of my friends, a number also purchased it, and we have all basically been left pretty disappointed."
2,Dissapointment,"I looked forward to revelations about being of mixed blood. It was hard to read the book all the way to the end, but when I did, there was only the one revelation: you don't know where you fit in. I guess I could have assumed that.The writing was amateurish, more like something written by a high-schooler. There were a lot of unnecessary descriptions of what the author and her friends wore, I suppose this was to create setting, but there's more to setting than fashion: ""While I'm here I wear long gauzy skirts and tank tops in muted colors. Flip -flops. I wrap my hair with strips of Kente cloth so that my dreads stick straight up out of the top of my head, and I walk.""I was disappointed by a consistent tone of self-importance, even narcissism, which is distracting in the memoirs of famous people, and off-putting in the memoirs of children of the famous."
4,The beginner's introduction to greenhouses.,"Good book for those who just want basic information and principles. Descriptive literature is good, pictures are excellent, and the book is pleasantly / logically arranged. Is it the ""source"" on greenhouses, no. However, it is a good read and good book. I have purchased other resources (including the heavy text recommended by another reviewer) and find this book to be generally as informative as the others, particularly given its price."
1,Beware !,"Beware ! If you are a purist like me, these are not the original songs, except Remember (Walkin' In The sand). I wondered why the artists were not listed- now I know why."
3,Specific Use,"This holster seems excellent for carrying a second weapon when out hunting or even something out of the way for hikes, but for a concealed carry rig, eh...It does fit quite well after a bit of adjustment and tinkering, but the retention strap makes it difficult to draw quickly (it runs a bit long and tends to get in the way of the draw for me).The other issue I have is that the holster covers the trigger on the body side, but doesn't on the external face. This could just be my pistol, but is still a concern for daily (condition 1) carry. I plan on having a bit of material placed to complete a trigger guard, but until then it has to stay in the closet.Overall, a decent holster, but needs some work to make it truly useful (and safe)."
3,kevin the great,this houlster is nice but has its quirks the retention strap is a little hard to snap and likewise hard to un-fasten not for a quick draw also the suspender like cross strap in the back is realy hard to get comfortable but once you find that perfect spot tape it up so it doesnt move or it will not be comfortable but holds my .40S&W just fine for daily carry and conceal.
3,Works but could never get it comfy,I still feel like its not very concealed despite owning a smaller version of my gunNever seems like it's adjusted rightBut it still works
2,Not Great,"Very uncomfortable but at least secure. Next time I would spring for Bianchi or something of similar quality. Use Uncle Mikes for pocket/waist holsters where comfort isn't really an issue. This is the first Uncle Mikes product I've been disappointed in, but again, it's pretty cheap compared to some others."
4,Marcus Didius Falco continues to please...,"In this third book of the Falco series, our erstwhile ""informer"" is hired to suss out the intentions of one recently engaged gold-digger whose previous two marriages ended in disaster for her betrothed. But, before Falco can piece the lady's plan together, her fiancee is killed, the gold-digger's suspectedness is questioned, and a sophisticated lady comes to reside -- for good -- in Falco's new high-society apartment.Davis continues to delight with the Falco series. Humor once again pervades the narration but is much subtler and wittier than ever. The story, too, is more subtle in its development and much more appealing to a mass market audience, not just fans of the genre.Well written and worth reading."
4,Great Wit--Great History!,"I'd give this novel a 4.5 if I could. It isn't the top of the line as Falco stories go, but it's so far superior to most other historical mysteries that I hated to rate it less than 5. This is the novel that contains Davis's most waggish bit of BRITISH fun, on page 135 (paperback version):""It was a hundred years since Rome decided to civilize the Gauls;. . . I am prepared to concede that one day the three cold Gallic provinces will come up with a contribution to the civilised arts--but nobody is going to convince me that it will be mastery of cuisine.""My best friend, married to a Frenchman who is an excellent home-kitchen chef, fell off her chair at that one, as I had done when I read it a few years earlier! And that's just one sample of Davis's mordant sense of ""tweak.""I demand to know why this book is out of print!"
3,Not what I expected,The lotion is not what I expected. I thought it would be creamier and blend into the skin better. just ok.
4,safe eyes,"Nice sunglasses, they fit well over my prescription glasses and I am no longer bugged by the sun."
3,Ho Hum,"Stories in this collection were of generally good quality and enjoyable to read. However, this collection definitely lost the over the top, right on the brink, edgy feel of the first Splatterpunks collection. Sure it has its share of necrophilia, gratuitous gore, usw.; but, it just didn't do it for me. It's worth the read if you can pick it up cheap, but don't expect it to live up to the first collection."
1,Was not for me..,It did not work for me. I think that the product could have had better instructions. Also the packaging was not as it looked..
4,Insightful!,"Michael Orey begins his thorough examination of the courtroom battles against big tobacco by examining Horton v. American Tobacco, the Mississippi case that launched the mid-1980s barrage of legal attacks on big tobacco and led eventually to U.S. settlements of more than $200 billion. As they read about the assault on Brown and Williamson, cinema buffs may feel they are revisiting The Insider with Al Pacino. The book combines a walk-through of the day-to-day legal procedures and motions with a look into the lives of the major players. This well-written volume presents the tobacco case like an engrossing true-crime story, although some readers may find it has too much detail to hold their interest. We [...] recommend this fascinating book to most general readers. But while executives searching for principles to apply to their own companies may find themselves captivated, they won't find much here that is generally applicable."
1,The first part of the New Testament is missing,"This is TNIV Church Bible edition printed by Zondervan. I usually start reading the bible at The New Testament. What a surprise to find most of the gospels gone. Pages 851 to 978 are missing. Price on back of book is $12.99 & I paid $9.91. No, I won't return it because it needs to be trashed like the rest of the printing should have been.Amazon you have become my best friend since I became a shut-in but please get rid of these books. They are an insult to your customers.Scholars put many hours into this TNIV revision & I want to read a copy. Therefore I'll try again & hope for better results."
3,Dishwasher vent,"Great color to match my oil rubbed faucet some water comes out of the base, but it is set in my sink so it doesnt cause any problems, none below the countertop."
2,Good Experience,"This is a decent movie, and even fairly suspenseful. However, there are parts that keep this Patric Swazye flick from being given 4 or 5 stars. One is that fact that the film is rather contradictory on several points, which I will leave to you the viewer to discover. Another problem is the simpicity of the film. A man is in jail for his wifes murder; he is acquitted; someone trys to frame him by killing associates in the same manner his wife was killed; in the end, he is proven innocent. The same plot as a thousand other films. This movie seems to have striking characteristics seen in ""The Fugitive"", but it simply goes too far. Not a high recommendation.GOD BLESS YOU !"
2,Made for Television,"This movie was made for television; instead of a major rent, or buy movie.The beginning is interesting, to the middle of the movie. Towards the end of the movie it started making no sense. I felt the acting almost didn't relate to the other parts of the movie."
3,Excellent Opening Song,"I found the movie a little slow at times, but I enjoyed some of the suspense the movie had to offer. I really like the song by the sister group, very original. The movie deserves two stars for the acting and one for that song. I would recommend this movie to friends."
5,Track Listing,"AUDIO CASSETTE.1. Hit The Deck2. What Is Hip3. Dorkin' The Muffin4. Sprechen Sie Be Bop5. Wo, Dude6. Feet First7. Your Eyes8. Dr. Zeus, King Of The Gods9. Fully Custom10. Shred It11. Waiting"
1,Holiday Romance by Charles Dickens,"This child's story about the imaginary romance of a boy and girl, missed the mark. I found it rambling and confusing. I kept losing the plot in the changes from the adult characters to the juvenile group. The language lacket the clarity and precision that I usually find in Dickens' work and if this was first published serially in the newspapers, some of the chapters are missing."
2,disappointing,Not at all what I expected - very hard to follow and for a Dickens piece - a disappointment. Didn't finish.
5,tag maker.,"this product arrived very quickly. i appreciate that, especially since i am in full swing of christmas crafting. lots of fun. love it."
4,Crap Cars,"This is a great book, it was exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I didn't like about the book was the size. I thought it would be more coffee table size but is perfect for dresser or desk decor. Well worth the price & the seller was excellent!"
2,Didn't we see this last year?,"An amusing book, much touted recently in such lofty places as the New York Times Book Review, but eerily reminiscent of last year's similar in tone (and content, let's face it, we know which cars are going to end up in a book like this) but much better written Automotive Atrocities!: The Cars We Love to Hate by Eric Peters. Peters has the advantage of a deeper background in cars and speaks with a greater sense of perspective and a little more love about his subjects, making for a more satisfying read. But if snarkily written essays are what you like, this is your book."
2,Richard Porter needs to grow up,"Just as the first reviewer above mentioned how the title of this book caught his eye, I too was drawn in by the perfectly blunt front cover. After all, we all know for sure what a lemon the Yugo turned out to be. Unfortunately, the rest of the book basically amounts to a third grader taunting another classmate. Why go after the Datsun b210? Because it rusted a bit? Cars are made of metal! They all eventually rust! The 210 was one of the most dependable cars ever built. Even the author recognizes the fact that the 510 would have started after a nuclear war. In other words, if you're looking for an in depth look at some of the worst cars ever built, look elsewhere. Porter decided to pick random cars out of his imaginary top hat, and dissect them with all the wit of a 4 year old. I gave one star for the nice hardcover, glossy format...and one star because it's the Christmas season. Bah, humbug."
1,This is a crappy book.,"True, some of these cars are real ""ugly ducklings"", but a few stand out as not belonging in this book. The Yugo, sure. But the Hummer is not crap. The Nissan 300ZX is not crap. The Fiero is not crap. The Delorean is not crap.Whats worse then some of the cars featured in the book are the lousy write-ups on some of the cars. ""Inaccurate"" is an understatment for some of what is in the book. Some ARE dead-on, but his attempts at being witty fall rather flat.he should take a spin in a few of these machines, then he can call them crap. Hopefully, he'll take the Yugo out on a nice mountain road during a blizzard.... :P"
1,"what does ""crap"" mean to this guy?","commentary on cars are plain stupid , and a lot of cars in there are born to be different and marginal(a couple of them i like very mutch] the author din't seam to understand that , i bet he is a reely mainstream guy..."
4,This is a very funny book,"I loved this book - it's funny - there's a lot of truth to the pithy descriptions on each car. Alas, I owned number 11 (do you think 22,000 miles is too soon to replace a cam shaft???)There are omissions from this book - but it really begs for a sequel - More Crap Cars?"
5,Best Pasta Sauce!!!!!,"Anyone that buys this sauce will not be dissappointed! I purchased it today at a specialty Italian market. I put three bottles on the deli counter and asked the employees which one they would recommend. As soon as they saw this bottle, they reflexively said this one.Like the reviewer above, I thought I tasted red peppers. But when I read the actual ingredients, I'm not sure if it does contain red peppers. However, this sauce definitely has a kick to it. I made this sauce with imported spaghetti and it was absolutely fantastic. I look forward to trying it with chicken.This would make a great quick meal to serve for guest and it will make a definite impression. Also, be sure to use fresh parmesian cheese. If you use the cheap kraft cheese, you will wreck the dish."
5,GREAT EARLY CONCERT,THIS CONCERT IS GREAT. YOU GET TO SEE FIRST HAND WHAT THE BUZZ WAS ALL ABOUT. JEFF'S PLAYING WAS OFF THE CHARTS.SITTING OR STANDING MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THIS GUY. FULL THROTTLE. THE LATER SHOW IN MONTREUX IN 1999 IS A LITTLE MORE REFINED BUT BUY BOTH FOR YOUR COLLECTION. GOD BLESS JEFF HEALEY. HIS LIFE IS A TRIBUTE TO WHAT THE HUMAN SPIRIT CAN DO REGARDLESS OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.
1,Poor quality,"I bought a spindle of 10: in the box half the discs were with one type of plastic cover, the other half with another type, both of which cheap-looking. At least one of the discs was not recognized as valid media by my burner (Hitachi).I have bought before almost 100 Apple DVD-R discs and I never had one single problem. And their CD boxes look way more professional.I really do not recommend these Memorex discs."
4,A great puzzle but one small problem,"It took me a few days to put the puzzle together which is not bad however I was dissapointed to find out that as I search for the last piece of the puzzle it wasn't there, I though I dropped it but aver searching all over I still could not find it, its a great puzzle but not being able to finish it sucked."
5,wish for the wonderstruck,"well after 20 years i still recall when i first heard Mary's Danish while living and working in the Fullerton area of Southern California. they were practically a standing icon of the Cal State Fullerton campus. this album in particular has always been a musical favortite of mine and people who love music as i do will usually ask ""who is that your're listening to?"" It is original song writing and performance of a youthful co-ed working group whose eclectic subjects are set to musical styles that combine punk, pop, rock , ska and country executed in a freshly original and tasteful concoction.Too bad i never received the disc........ah ppbbbhhhh!!!!!"
4,Another good book from Ms. Bishop,"This is a touching tale of bravery, survival, and love. The characters are so familiar they will remind you of people you know. Keep a box of tissue handy for the ending. It's fast paced and easy reading. Very enjoyable and stands on it's own."
4,Fairy Tales,"I love Anne Bishops writing and this book is just another example of why. Her Dark Jewels Trilogy is the best fanatsy I've ever read and this book encompasses many of the wonderful things from that series. As a stand alone book, it doesn't have the detailed plot intricacies that a series would have but it is definitely involved and has a very fairy tale like quality about it. It is light hearted for the most part, being about a girl trying to cope on her own, attracting the eye of a Fey Lord, and trying to keep herself out of the hands of the witch hunters. A very good book if you like fantasy and romance combined in equal parts"
5,All about Love,"I loved this book. It is all about love in all its forms. What it is and specifically, what it is not. It is a large departure from her last series, and the writing isn't quite as dark. I hope she writes more of them."
2,not anne bishop's best work....,"Anne Bishop is a great writer but if this is your first experience with her writings you may be disappointed. This world wasn't as tangible as her other world of the dark jewels series. The problem I had was that I just couldn't get into the characters, their personalities and conflicts. I would recommend her Dark jewels series, also the invisible ring is a great read (presequel) of the series. The dark jewels seemed to have more past and details just an all around more complete world. At times the series is dark but all around anne bishop pulls off a great story."
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"I was drawn into Anne Bishop's novels through the Sebastian/Belladonna and then the Black Jewel series. I was hesitant to read these, but I was impressed with her ability to create yet another unique world. Her knack for familial relationships and the gray areas of good vs. evil, kept me turning pages and looking forward to the sequel."
3,Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining,"This was the first Anne Bishop book I read and I loved it! I could not put this one down. I had to know what was going to happen next. I found my self caring about the characters. I hated the witch hunters with as much passion as I loved the witches. I have never read a book, where the witch was the good guy and worth saving from the real evil of the world. The story was a lesson in not being judgemental - all humans are not good and all witches are not evil. After having read this book, I devoured the 2 remaining ones in the series and bought all the other books that she has written. I have yet to be disappointed. Anne Bishop is a throughly enjoyable writer."
4,Very good...,"Okay, so not *riveting*, but very good. 5 stars means my kids can Magic Marker the walls as long as they leave me alone so I can read, so this one got a 4 IMO. I did read the Black Jewels trilogy first, and would give it a 4.5. I would not say the Black Jewels is much *better*, just a different style & story that I liked a little more. My biggest complaint with this series was trying to figure out which in this series was first! (It's Pillars of the World, #2 is Shadows and Light.) Definitely recommended."
2,totally disappointed,"I had to force myself to finish this book. The characters never developed enough for me to care about them. God I miss Daemon and Satan. Ms. Bishop, please bring them back! Pillars Of The World is totally different then Daughters and I guess that's the problem for me. All the characters are weak and boring. I'm not used to characters like that coming from the mind of Anne Bishop."
4,Pillars is a fun read for Bishop fans,"As a big fan of the Dark Jewels trilogy (along with prequel and anthology), I knew that this series would be on my list of must reads being by Anne Bishop. She didn't dissapoint me. The storyline flowed, the characters were wonderful (even if you loved to hate them) and the themes in the book were interesting and easy to follow along without being entirely too predictable.A good read for any Anne Bishop fan. Even if you do prefer the Dark Jewels stories better (which I do), this is still a very fun read!"
4,Too Easy,"This book was very good. Too bad for me I made the mistake of thinking the beginning set-up. So I was rather attatched to Lucian and Dianna. The people you adore from the start, with the exception of Neall and Ari, you despise at the end. I had never thought of the Fae(or elf like creatures) in a bad way before. But these people really change your mind rather quickly. I reccomend it, and the one that comes after it, but I warn that the one that comes next has very little to do with Neall and Ari :o( But it does offer other stories that are almost as touching :o)"
3,Pillars of the World,"While The Black Jewels Triligy was extordinarly writen and some of the best books I have ever seen. Pillars of the World lacks the something that wes so readily avalible in her other works. It is not the worst book, but if you want something to keep you turning the pages and guessing at what will happen next you should try another book"
4,Reading Fan,"I have read all of Anne Bishop's books and must say I am a devoted fan. While I really enjoyed the dark jewel trilogy, this book captured my attention almost immediately. I made the mistake of starting in late at night and could not put the book down. Pillars of the World was an easy read and held my interest through out the book. Not only is this book about good and evil, it is a love story as well. I liked the characters, especially the Gatherer. Can't wait for the next book in this trilogy, Shadows and Light!"
3,Is this even Bishop?,"First, I have to say that Anne Bishop is one of my favorite authors. I fell in love with the Black Jewels Trilogy, the characters, and the world. I was excited when I read that Pillars would be set in a new relm, however. I wanted to see what else she could do, what new places she could take me. I enjoyed the read, there was a fair-is-foul element that was entertaining, and it was generally a nice book. However, it was only after I looked at the cover after finishing it that I remebered it was Anne Bishop's work. It really didn't seem like her style at all. It actually reminded me a little of Patricia Briggs. Overall, the plot was a bit weak, the villian unconvincing, and the ending very haphazard. I really don't know what to say about the book except that I wasn't impressed. But I must admit that if it had been any other author than Bishop I would have enjoyed it. However, knowing what she's capable of, I felt very let down."
3,Not on par with the Jewels series,"This story about the fae is well thought out and put together. It shows the forgetfulness and self-centeredness of the Fae beautifully. The only problem with it is that it has a slow beginning, and takes too long to capture the readers interest as we wait for the storyline to build. The characters don't have the wonderful dialogue that we find in the Jewels trilogy, or in The Invisible Ring. Followers that are fond of the Jewels trilogy will enjoy the read, but inevitably be disappointed that it falls short of Bishop's previous writing. Where I constantly read and re-read her other works (on my second copies, as the first ones have fallen apart), I will happily avoid adding this to my collection."
3,hmmm,this is a different flavour from anne bishop's other books. it does not have any of the dark and haunting theme which the blood series had but overall it makes a good read...good for all her fans
3,"I'll finish the trilogy, but I'm not a fan so far...","** spoiler alert ** I agree with one other reviewer when she expressed frustration that the author abandoned a potentially more exciting and fulfilling relationship between Lucian and Ari rather than her choosing Neall. I have to always remind myself that Anne Bishop books are never a ""feel good"" type of read. She has villains that are quite ruthless, vicious and sadistic. Yes they almost always get what's coming to them in the end, but it's never as satisfying as I would like it to be. That's why I'm rating this 3 stars b/c I know how it all ends. Bleh"
4,Great Book,This Book is Awesome i enjoy reading it it sure has taught me alot its really for a beginner though.
2,bleh...,"Buyer Beware - MAKE SURE THIS IS THE TEXTBOOK. I ordered this used, but they sent me the study guide."
3,"Perhaps, the book is not horrible and it is just my class","This book tries so hard to make social and cultural variances seem like scientific fact. Of course, a nursing text should discuss patient care but not as always black and white; it edges on stereotyping at times. Conversely, if physiology is mentioned, the science behind the concept is often ignored. I think this book is based on pseudo-science at times.Perhaps, it is just my class that has confused me because the book, lecture and exams have nothing to do with each other; so, consequently, the book seems less relevant.The procedures in the back of each chapter are helpful."
4,"Not bad, much too short a season","I always liked Eliza Dushku in this series but I'm not one of those that expected it to last. I was actually surprised that it even made it into a second season the way the series took a dark turn towards the end of 1st season. Still, having said that, I was glad when Fox did finally bring it back for a midseason replacement (I guess they called it). The stories were well thought out and written, even made Jason Priestley's character look like he wanted to switch sides once. It would definitely have been better programming (maybe even better ratings) if Fox had allowed the season to finish. Such a quick end to things although I did sort of like their Christmas cliffhanger."
5,Tru,"Fox did not give Tru time to become a good show. They switched the night of the show constantly and kept it off the air for so long they lost a lot of viewers. Who really would rather watch a tv show about a blonde bimbo *Paris Hilton trapsing across the country than a show that actually has meaning is beyond me, but whatever floats your boat. The comic blend off making death a light matter made the show watchable. Sort of expecting a full second season like all other people I am glad they actually did one good thing and put the episodes they did air on DVD. Thanks Fox for finally doing something right!"
4,PLEASE BRING BACK TRU CALLING!,"Tru Calling Season 2 is a wonderful continuation of the Fox Show Tru Calling. I just wish that this included some sort of conclusion of the entire season. The last episode ends with the audience feeling like we are still in the middle of the season. It already is a let down that Fox cancelled the show. The creaters of Tru Calling could have at least completed the season. OVERALL, I love the show!"
5,Tru Calling Joins The Fox List Of Good Show Graveyards,"Thank goodness this potentially great show with the gorgeous Eliza was killed off before the idiots at Fox made a fortune on it when it became a huge megahit. How do I know this?Why, of course that's because dead TV shows TALK to me.""Help me,"" cried Tru Calling as it was laid out in DVD form in the video morgue I work in. But it was far too late for it. The clown suits at Fox, due to their ridiiculous multiple scheduling of the show, had totally mucked things up so badly that even people like me couldn't relive any particular day in order to save it.The Fox clods have also screwed up in this very same way with other great shows like Wonderfalls and a host of others during recent years.So R.I.P., Tru Calling. You were solid gold placed at the feet of Fox and they were so stupid that they threw you out the window.That's why they deserve all the negative future karma which fate will be likewise throwing their way."
3,Too bad it was cancelled!,"This was a very entertaining series. My biggest disappointment was the fact that there were only two episodes on season 2, which cost the same as season 1."
4,great series,"This was a great series, but it was cut after 5 episodes of the second season. This boxs have this 5 episodes + 1 episod that was not sent on tv. Tru Dawis work in a morg. The dead cal to her for help, and she livs that day over again to provent that person from ending up dead again."
3,music in tru calling,"I likes that show and I was sorry when I learnt it was canceled. It's a little out of the subject, but I also loved the music in the show, particularly the one at the end of the last episode, when Jack, Tru and all her friends and family spend christmas together. Do you know the artist and the title ?"
2,Poorly written,"The actresses and actors were capable, the premise had possibilities, but it was so blandly written, that there was nothing to grab onto. No complexity, no evolving mythos, nada. The last few stories of the first season, and a couple of second season stories showed promise, but the rest were not worthwhile. A series that was sabotaged by an underdeveloped premise, and uninspired writing."
1,What A Winner,"We used this ""rechargable"" item for a couple hours of pictures. It would not recharge. I finally threw it away and ordered the same thing from Kodak. Theirs works fine. It rated Zero stars."
2,Get Jeremy Birn's book first,"Before you even think of buying this book, you should first read ""Digital Lighting & Rendering"" by Jeremy Birn. Birn's book covers many more subjects in much more detail. Fleming's book presents some useful theories about clutter. Other than that, compared to the Jeremy Birn book, ""3D Photorealism Toolkit"" has little to recommend it."
3,get [digital] lighting and rendering,"This book does indeed contain true insight into creating photorealism, and using Fleming's concepts, it is easy to surpass his own attempts at photorealism. This book would be, however, much more valuable to a 19 year old kid who just got his hands on TrueSpace than to a professional artist. If you are looking for a quick and helpful read about many of the same concepts, but presented more concisely and technically, read [digital] lighting and rendering, or so I believe it to be called."
3,"A good book, BUT... (+ a useful URL)","Well, i cant say that the book isnt good, because it is, even very good, but it really all depend on your needs. The book is very theoretical, and not too practical if your looking for training on a specific application. It is well written, in a nice, easy language, and some b&w photos. If you realy want the book, get it, but here is a url of a website which is somesoft of a summary of the book!"
4,Photorealism made easy,"This book discussed ways to make your 3D images more realistic, using techniques I either hadn't thought of, or had no idea how to implement. The book is in a chatty, humerous style that can sometimes grate on your nerves, but it is easy to understand and learn from, which is the most important point.The only drawback to this volume is that most of the illustrations are in black and white, which makes seeing the necessary comparisons in texture rather difficult. Color images are available on plates in the middle section (but not all of them) and on a website. While the website is a good idea for distributing the color images, it would have been handier to have a CD, even if the price of the book had been higher."
4,A must Have,"I bought this book over 3 years ago and I keep going back for it for reference. The book covers photorealism as principles and guidelines that establish much more understanding concering producing 3d imagery.The problem that it's lighting section is a bit weak and it does not have almost any color pages.If you would like to become a better 3d artist, buy this one."
4,The best I've read this year,Definitely the best book on 3D graphics I've read this year. Fleming's pedantic attitude is exactly what is required for a thorough discussion of currently-available photorealistic techniques.
4,new mom at 48,"We've had this toy for years and our 6 year old boy loves it. It blows me away the things he makes with it--weedwhacker, crazy hats and crowns, silly creations. I would not try to copy stuff, just make your own things with it. I don't understand or agree with the critism of this toy...it's a good toy! Just don't give it to a child to ahead of their age skill level--which is true for any toy."
3,Less than Expected,I purchased this product for my six year old. He thinks it is just OK. My three year old broke the pieces easily.
4,Educational fun,"My 3 year old's preschool group played with this toy for an hour the other day, and my son cried when we had to put it away because he hated to tear down his creation! This is definitely an educational toy that I will be buying for my own home--the creative possibilities it allows are endless! Very good buy."
2,Flimsy Foam Builders,"I just thought these were flimsy, but I guess that's what you get from foam. I also didn't like that the wires would poke out of the tube shapes after a while."
2,Too hard to use,"I bought this thinking it would be a ""quick fix"" to my CD labeling problem.Not so, I need to spend much time, which I don't have, to use it right. Instead it sits in the corner."
5,Great product,"They bought a few of these at my son's school. He loved them, as did his friends, and was delighted to have a pair of his own as a birthday present!"
3,disappointed,"i didnt like the fact that when your out of the adhisive your out, you would have to buy another set just for the glue,"
3,The Storyteller's Daughter,"I've just (today) recieved ""The Storyteller's Daughter"" all I needed to read was the name Shahrazad and I knew it was The Arabian Nights. Still I read it and yes I finished it and I do not know how to rate the book. A thing to note is that it is a variation on The Arabian Nights. Seeing it as such, I cannot give it a succinct rating. The story was interesting and she (the author) did not in the least conceal that it was a variation on The Arabian Nights....Suffice it to say, it ... is, however, a worthwile read."
2,Not a favorite,I like the author and esp. enjoyed the Sleeping Beauty book in this series. She has a lovely style of writing and Shaharazad's storytelling is wonderfully done. But I felt the big flaw with this one was that the king's heart melted too quickly; it took away a lot of the tension that should have been building. Part of the problem may be that these books are so short. But I just wasn't feeling the fairy tale magic with this one.
4,the storytellers daughter,"This is the retelling of the story Arabian Nights. It is about Shaharazad, the daughter of the storyteller. She (Shaharazad) gets married to King Sharyar whose previous wife killed her self after he found out she was going to try and take over the kingdom. Because his previous wife plotted against him he decides to be married for one night unless his new wife finds the true meaning of his heart. If she doesn't her will kill her the next morning. Why does Shaharazad marry him you may be asking? The reason why is because she decides to do the one thing that she does best and that is to tell this King a story each night that wont end by morning so she will live another day because the King wants to know the end. This is wonderful book with a great plot and exuberant characters. I gave it 4 stars because it wasnt the BEST book in the retelling of fairytails (snow, beauty sleep, ect.)"
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in what the author did with Shahrazad. Originally, Shahrazad saved her own life, and thereby the lives of many other women by being clever enough to make up so many stories and to stay clever in a time of crisis. In this book, the author made the storytelling a magical power instead of giving credit to the wit and creativity of the character. Then she made her blind! She took a strong, smart, witty character and turned her into something much less. I did like the stories in the book, however, so I would say that the book is worth reading."
3,You get what you pay,"I bought Sthurling watch just for the look of it and price, never saw it as a real piece. A package came on time, looking good, but it had day/night indicator not working . So overall watch looks good, but quality is not superb.Mindaugas"
4,excellent for one hour use,"First digital recorder for me and found this one to be excellent. It does everything it says in the standard play mode. For 180 minutes, you have to put up with quite a reduction in sound quality. But if you are recording your own voice and can be near the mike, it will easiy be recognizable. Doesn't do too well to pick up a discussion. For the one hour standard format, it is a winner with many good features. .... The weight is light and really easy to carry around. I had been using a good Lanier and will still use that for picking up groups of voices or speakers at a distance."
3,A 67 minutes recorder,"I bought this recorder because it can record 180 minutes. There are three recording modes. For 180 minutes, you have to put up with very poor sound quality. The sound of standard play mode is excellent, but only record 67 minutes."
1,never received cd,i have not received this yet please let me know what i can do i dont have the receipt or info from when i ordered it
3,Hello!? How do u write a review w/out hearing the whole cd.,"I like a couple songs but for the whole, the album was too slow and monotonous. One More Time is really nice and the instrumentals are very calming. I think this cd could have used more upbeat songs but in general it was still pretty good."
5,From the beginning to the end,"Soundtracks have always been some of my favorite CD's- I love any type of compilation that invokes emotion. I read the book which was okay (tearjerker of an ending) but this soundtrack is truly amazing!!! I actually won it through a contest last week and it hasn't left my CD player since. The only cut I had heard was ""Only Lonely"" by Hootie and the Blowfish and think every other song is just as good if not better. Wonderful job. Wonderful!"
5,A Great Love Story!!!,"This is on of the best movies I have ever seen!!! If you haven't seen it don't wait another day!!! Go see it tonight! I love the song ""Dear Catherin"", it is one of my all time favorites. Thank you to all the people who worked on this CD!!!"
5,"""Message"" Received","The ""Message In A Bottle"" soundtrack is undoubtedly the best movie album I have ever experienced. Each song floats along the same thematic rhythm but there are a few musical ""swells"" thrown in for variety and good measure. Unlike the movie, this is one recording which definitely has a happy ending and sails off peacefully into the sunset. Well worth purchasing!"
3,The nature sounds were AWFUL!!!,"I will say, first, that I didn't test the alarm portion of the clock. I liked the Glade Plug-Ins aspect of it. I bought this b/c I like to have some sort of white noise machine in my kids' rooms to mask the sounds of my husband, who rises earlier than the rest of us. The nature sounds were terrible and not at all relaxing. ""Ocean"" is the sounds of waves (what I was expecting) and shrill seagulls that never shut up. ""Brook"" is the sound of a babbling brook (also expected) that is practically drowned out by the sound of birds and crickets. ""Forest"" was the worst as it was a bunch of obnoxious exotic birds and wind, I guess. I didn't expect much when I bought a clock ..., not even good quality sounds. I did expect them to be standard recordings that were quiet and repetitious enough to fall asleep to. This clock is going back to the seller ASAP.As a side note, this does have volume control (L/M/H),unlike some other clocks I've read about."
2,Desperate Measures,"Complete and utter crock of trash. The beginning of the film started off failrly well and I was starting to enjoy it. As if looking down a large and scary slop it all went down hill from that point on. I'm struggling to find out how someone could rate this movie anything above 2/5. I will admit that Michael Keaton played his character well, however, the plot of the movie was thin at best. All I can say is that buyer beware. If you like Micheal Keaton - then get it. If, for that matter, you like Andy Garcia as the 'cop who has to save is son' then get it. Otherwise, steer clear of this movie as I personally didn't find it enjoyable."
4,Organ,"His son need's a organ, and ge want his to give his kidney to him, but he doesn't give it up with out a fight."
2,Just sad,"Plot, writing, and dialog are rediculous. Both actors could do a much better job, but given the sillyness of the whole thing, did passibly well. Really silly b-movie horror ending. Yuck."
3,DRASTIC MEASURES PERHAPS?,"Admittedly preposterous and implausible, DESPERATE MEASURES is nonetheless a tidy and engaging thriller. Director Barbet Schroeder eschews his usual heavy handed drama for this action thriller in which Michael Keaton plays a very vile criminal who happens to be the only donor available for the dying child of cop Andy Garcia. Brian Cox is underused in his role as Garcia's boss, and Marcia Gay Harden has done better than this role as the persistent doctor. Garcia's performance is dedicated, and Joseph Cross as the young boy is charmingly effective. Keaton, however, seems to be playing his role as a comic character instead of the outlandishly evil man he is. The ending is one that will probably irritate you, it did me, but overall the movie does what it was probably supposed to do."
4,Standard action-suspense fare,"This derivative action suspenser about a psychopath, which has been slammed by critics as well as most reviewers below, may not be the greatest of its kind, though it is redeemed by the performance of Michael Keaton, who is always absorbing in this the role of manipulative, intelligent villains - (see him also in ""Pacific Heights"", which is a very good complimentary film to this one.) Otherwise, the film is a breathlessly fast-moving thriller, at a suitable length."
5,Don't buy any other Duc manual!,"I originally planned on buying the factory manual from Ducati for my Duc907, but quickly found out that even the Ducati mechanics recommend using the Haynes manual over the factory one. Good thing, too, because the factory manual costs $80 (if they even have it in stock) vs. $29 for the Haynes manual. To top it all off, Amazon offers if for just $19 and can get it to you the next day. Such a deal, I just bought another one for my brother!"
2,Beautiful but...,"The botanical prints in the huge volume are lovely, but I thought that there would be more prints such as the one on the book cover that show flowers in a natural or landscape setting. It turns out that this is one of the ONLY prints of that kind in the book. Also the book arrived WARPED which is probably why it was so inexpensive."
4,"When you listen to your heart, your life becomes a blessing!","I first read ""Major in Success"" in 1994 and found it to be an exciting, inspirational, entertaining, creative and straightforward presentation of how we all have the capacity within us to recognize and achieve our life's passion. I recently read the revised version and it continues to motivate me personally and professionally. As a career counselor, it is the one book I recommend to my students, particularly first year students. Patrick, you are an inspiration and a wonderful role model. Oprah, if you are listening I would book this guy in a second!! Mary DeManss Recruitment Specialist/Career Advisor Career Development & Placement LOYOLA COLLEGE in MARYLAND"
5,This book is so informative!,This book allows college students to understand what their real priorities in life should be. I would recommend it to anyone in high school or college. It only took me three days to read it; I couldn't put it down!
5,The best of the best self-help books out there!,"Wow! I don't know where to start about this book. Major in Success is such a power tool to help ANYONE (not only college students!) to look for their dream job. I don't know where else I would be without these helpful tips, practical reasonings, and great feedback from people who ALREADY made it! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who are chasing after their dreams but are too shy too. It made a difference in me and I think it would definitely make a difference in you! Here's the big plus: The author is donating 100% of the profits to charities. Not only are you helping yourself, you are helping the world too!"
3,"Eh, it's ok","The book has some commonsense advice to follow, but it's a little too anecdotal and the cultural references are about 10 years too old, as well as the ghastly cover with the picture of the 'hip young multicultural people' who are appear to be a lesbian couple, a token black girl, and two reasonably normal looking guys, all of whom are unfortunately dressed exceedingly badly. And Patrick Combs could at least have put a nice atmospheric black and white picture of himself on the back in profile, rather than take a front-on picture that was unflattering to his Goldie Hawn ears."
1,Lacks basic formatting structure. Bad Reading Overall,"I bought the book because it's related to telecom project management since I couldn't find any other book on this topic and it had good rating. This book is not cheap and has lot of mispelled words, awkward paragraph structure, copy and paste of paragraphs from one to chapter to another. Overall, not recommended."
5,My Favorite Poet,"Catie Rosemurgy is now one of my favorite poets. She says the things I wouldn't dare say in a way I wouldn't have dreamed. Her subjects range from Mick Jagger and Steve Earle to Fairy Tales and one-night-stands. One subject comes up again and again throughout the book: boys, a subject that really allows her get to the heart of things. Every poem in My Favorite Apocolypse (and this is a rarity) is sad, funny, beautiful, true, and so very, very good. She is imaginative without being pretentious, honest without being self-indulgent, personal without being private. Catie Rosemurgy writes great, mouth-watering lines that aren't flowery, though we should all send her flowers after this remarkable debut. Roses, of course."
3,Microsoft Laptop Messenger Bag by Vortex,"This case is a product that I wouldn't recommend.The case simply wasn't designed for easy use,it was too rigid for a messenger case and from the limited use I gave the case it didn't wear well.Most of the pocket(s) space really couldn't hold anything like the charger and charger cables,mouse,etc.The ""flap"" had zipper opening that didn't allow sufficient entry space to store any files only thing that was ""authentic"" was the Microsoft logo and that didn't mean very much!The case was designed to fit a 15.6 laptop and it was a good,snug fit for the notebook and not much else? I gave the ""messenger"" case away and happy to see someone make use of it!."
4,good news,"Ive had this table for over a year, still in perfect condition. very sturdy table, should last a long time."
4,Great table,I bought this for my college age sons. When friends come over we always have a game or three. The worst thing I can say about the game is that it is very heavy. It takes 2 adults to move it.
4,Definitely brings it,I had received a variety box set of these 2oz Designer Imposter cologne for my birthday. Bring It for Men Fragrance Spray Cologne is by far my favorite. I can't get enough of this stuff. It smells really sexy without being over powering. It has a masculine clean smelling scent when combined with your body heat. This cologne definitely brings it.
2,USA TV fragments,Should have red previous reviews. It's only fragments of very interestings films. But you will never see the scene in depth. It's almost a 60's American propaganda. Type of movies they used to recruit in colleges or universities. Only a one side view of the war.
3,Authentic,"While the commentary and the music were a little dull, I liked the fact that it was all real footage. It was broken down into different categories and painted a vivid picture of the style of warfare used at the time.."
3,Not the best.,"If you are not printing for special use - this paper is ok. Just want to share a photo, or maybe hang a photo up at work? - go for this paper. If you are looking to spend less on the paper you are printing your photos on - this is it. The quality is not the best. Definately not what I expect from the Kodak name. This really is for general use-not for those special pictures you want to look great!1smileycat :-)"
5,Precious In His sight.,"As a Christian, this CD has brought me into experiencing God's love in a fresh and experiential way. You truly feel the arms of His love as you listen and sing to the Lord with this CD. I highly recommend to anyone who needs affirmation of Lord's unconditional love. I love this CD and her previous one ""over and over""."
5,amazing quality for such a low price,"now i have come across other adapters before but this one is the best:1.gold pins both inside and out.2. the 1\4 fits nice and tight and well as the xlr side.3. The audio quality shows a vast difference an is clear. i used it on a pair of wireless mics since i am the pa operator for a few years now in a local church. the 1/4 was good but when i added the adapter things became much clearer, the heights meds and lows were well distinguished."
2,I expected a lot more,"I hike my dogs daily in the hills of rural Vermont, on the miles of trails out behind my house. I have one dog who covers many miles to my one and sometimes I worry when she's gone for more than a few minutes. I got this bell to help me keep track of her whereabouts, thinking that if it was called a ""sportsman's bell"", it would have a loud, clear ring that would be audible from quite a distance. WRONG! The bell has a high pitched tone and can only be heard from maybe 100 yards away. Also, the tab that loops on the collar is somewhat short so doesn't fit easily over the collar buckle. I bought a cheaper bell from my local feed store that has a longer collar attachment and also a clankier but more audible tone and I am a lot happier with this one."
5,Very good book for any young child!,My daughter (almost 5yrs) really likes this book! She has been asking us to read it every night since we purchased it. I'm looking into the other books in this series.
4,3 year old likes this book,The book is easy to read and has a good message. Would be a litter better if it rhymed or something. She looses interest toward the end. But overall a good book.
4,Good book,"I read this to my 3.5 yr old. It seems to be a bit over his head and doesn't get much requests. Maybe when he is older.After a few readings, I happened to notice that in one of the illustrations, all the children sitting it out were colored, and the ones playing (4 square or duck duck goose, I can't recall) appeared to be white. And I flinched. I don't pay much attention to the illustrations but my son studies them. I can't help wondering what he's picking up and filing away.Caveat - I didn't study it that closely. Just noticed a difference in color.Anyway, it is a great book for young children who need some tips on how to join in and play. Probably kindergarten age would be more appropriate."
1,A boy dressed as a girl in illustration,"The story line was great! The only problem I had was the illustrations. A boy dressed in a shirt with flowers and the last page the boy is dressed in a dress with a scarf. Why do we need to put these images in childrens books. Totally inappropriate. Sorry Free Spirit Publishing will not be purchasing any more books from you. The seller was good, shipped in a reasonable timeframe."
2,It's just not for me.,"I can see how someone could learn Japanese this way, maybe a beginner with no pre-existing knowledge of the Japanese language. But I've been trying to teach myself japanese for years, whenever my very short attention span would allow it. I found it difficult for myself, because of the way the author spells things out, which is exactly the way they're supposed to help you. I got mixed up because I'm now used to pronouncing Japanese words with Japanese vowel sounds, but this book emphasizes using the English pronunciation, which again is the entire purpose of their teaching method. Not to mention the fact that it's a really bad idea on their part, it was also a complete waste of my time on mine, because I didn't learn anything from it. I'm sure this book may prove helpful someone, but that someone just wasn't me."
1,Don't buy the kindle version,The formatting (or lack thereof) renders the book unusable. It simply amounts to a huge list of words that are impossible to search or read.
3,Just a Phrasebook. Nothing More. Nothing Less.,"This book has some interesting and helpful phrases to memorize but that's about it. It doesn't teach grammar or any of the kana's let alone Kanji. It's also a little boring and has no pictures.It's okay for a phrasebook but don't expect much more out of it than that. If you're good at memorizing phrases, this book may be helpful to you. However, you're going to need more resources than just this if you truly wish to learn the Japanese language."
2,Arrived dented!,"While the product works fine, the case arrived with a large dent in the top of the case, which prevents me from mounting an optical drive in the top slot.Further, I can't use covers for the top two optical drive bays, because the drive is mispositioned due to the case denting."
3,not the best,"In this book the Animorphs and Ax find out that instant rasien cinnimon oatmeal will make a Yeerk free from Kandrona, but the Yeerk will go insane. The Yeerk will stay in the host's head, no needing Kandrona, but the host will be in control almost all of the time. So the animorphs morphs moles and dig into a bat cave, then morphs bats and go into the Yeerk pool. Read the book to find out what happens next!"
3,"This is a good book, But definitely not the best.","This book starts when the animorphs are at the the new Planet Hollywood when they see a man jumping out the window at a office building. Rachel and the animorphs save him , but really no credit- because Big ARNOLD S.had to help. they soon go see the man. He is a controller, going crazy because he eats- instant oatmeal! Then they decide to go underground- to the yeerk pool!"
4,This book is full of action and humor.,The animorphs discover a weakness of the yeerks. And the yeerks go crazy for it! It`s called oatmeal! It is very action packed and one of my favorite animorphs yet!
5,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It was really funny,(as usual)and it makes you see Rachel's stubborn side and not the lunatic side. The ending was good, because it leaves you feeling ,um... something nice anyway. Lot's of humour and lot's of action(especially in the Yeerk pool). Recommended."
3,a fun read but lots of fluff,"The stories in this and the other similair books in the series are fun reads. Lots of short stories from the links and linksters. However, the book is stretched with pages of illustrations and wide margins obviously used to stretch the ""length"" of the book. Rather than a series of ""four"" books this material would be better served by one longer and better packaged book. I loved the material but felt cheated in the packaging. A reader of the series will also see frequent repetition of stories."
2,Could have been and should have been better,"An only so-so account of PGA Tour players, events and locales through the ages. I thought there would be more meat on this bone, but the book left me unsatisfied, like an average restaurant that serves too small portions."
2,small price for small book,I guess it`s true/ you get what you pay for. I knew it said minature version but this is not even funny. Book is tiny with only a few pages. Iwould not recommend wasting your money.
5,Well Written Biblical Defense,"John Frame's book Contemporary Worship Music, is a must for any Christian, who truly wants a balanced defense of today's Worship music. Frame's classically trained background in music, and his theological training as a teacher and student, make him the perfect writer to bring a ""balanced"" argument for the use of contemporary worship music. A perfect tool and resource for any worship leader and pastor."
4,the little book that could,"I never write reviews, but i feel like this little book needs a bit of a boost. I am living in Hong Kong for an extended period of time, and know absolutely no Chinese. I bought the collins phrasebook, but the word list in the back is nearly useless. There is also that other Cantonese Pinyin dictionary available... but that one doesn't have characters, just the pinyin, so that is useless as well. Other dictionaries only have characters, or only mandarin pinyin. So this little book is really all i've got. I'm most excited about the fairly thorough food section. And i love that it is geared towards people living in Hong Kong, with lots of local places translated.In my mind you have 2 choices, you pick this book up for 8 bucks, or you spend 100-300 on an electronic dictionary. obviously the electronic one will have more words... but i only had 8 bucks... so i'm pretty happy with this book. now if only i was better at the pronunciation, that is another story."
5,Don't miss this Miss,"Susan Kohler is so far off the radar of the mainstream recording industry that it is a shame. You can have all the American Idols and instant divas, but if you miss this you will miss one of this country's best singers. It's that simple."
3,Cute but difficult to put on for a slip on shoe,"Cons- Takes some effort to get the shoe on, even with very thin socksPros- Stays on the child's foot fairly well- Seems to be well constructed- Shoes resemble photo very closely- Size true to measured foot"
2,Difficult to put on children's feet,Tight fit and very difficult to put onto kids feet without giving a real tug to back tag of shoe.Not my favorite. Not practical.
3,"Cute shoes, but difficult to put on baby","These shoes are really cute and go with a lot of my son's clothing. However, they are very hard to put on!!"
3,I agree. Cute but difficult to get on.,"Cute shoes but hard to get on and they're even a little big. If they would make the loop by the heel a little bigger, that MIGHT be helpful. I'm tempted to cut the elastic."
2,JUST ANOTHER THINLY VEILLED SYFY MONEY GRAB,"As if SyFy needed another reason to piss off loyal viewers they decide not to release this in Bluray until they suck as mch money as possible out ot the dwindling audience they have left. What had evolved into a good series after a weak beginning is now cut short with no real ending and to further slap fans in the face, they decide to hold out on the Bluray release. If the Stargate franchise was so weak, why do they always end up putting reruns of SG-1 and Atlantis in practically every gap they have in their schedule. Maybe it's time to send them a message and hold off on buying season 2 until we get it in the format we want."
3,shouldn't have changed the formula,this is only for diehard fans of the stargate series (sg1 and atlantis). the formula was changed in this show and it lost its light hearted appeal (which was a key theme of sg1 and atlantis). the theme is more depressing and the characters are more flawed and real which over-dramatises this show.i only give it 3 stars because it pales in comparison to the original stargate show. if i did not have such a great reference point to compare it to i may have chosen to give it a higer score. i think some fans of stargate would still like this because they get a continued fix but others may not (which may be why it was cancelled relatively quickly compared to sg-1 and atlantis)
5,great,only regret there is no more to see. would like to compare it to blu ray. overall happy with purchase.
2,"new, but defective","I splurged and got the SGU season 1 new, but each episode (of the 6 I've watched so far) has glitches where the picture gets pixeled (is that a word?)Very disappointed."
3,Grows On You,"Since the last episode of Stargate SGU aired, I haven't watched the SyFy Network at all. I've missed the Stargate series (all of them) and it's clear that the network has no interest in producing customer-quality and popular series that, yes, might be expensive, but that's part of successful programming. In short, the network's decisionmakers are idiots. They had some templates that worked and they blew it. The stuff they have now is junk.Stargate Atlantis was great. SGU was cheap...but it grew on you. I didn't really watch it until I bought the DVDs. And it's strange that Season 1 was released in Blu-Ray and the second and best was not. It's just like SGA. The network just one day decided to pull the plug despite the viewership, quality and the fact that it was making money."
5,Why did choose this rating?,I chose this rating because the series was intriguing. It kept my interest the entire time it was on television
3,average at best,"I thoroughly enjoyed the series, particularly the characters' personal interaction when stranded aboard a giant starship. What I found tedious was their interaction with earth, which was only an unneccessary distraction from the major events that took place. If you're stranded, remain stranded. Don't introduce completely bizarre interactions. It only serves to weaken the premise of the show."
5,Loved this show....,"I liked Stargate SG-1, but Universe took itself a bit more seriously (like Battlestar Galactica), which I really loved. Dr. Rush and Eli were great characters, and I enjoyed watching both of them grow into deeper humans as a result of their trials and tribulations. However, like all good and thought-provoking shows, this one was cancelled before I had grown tired of it. Just like Firefly, or Jericho.... Glad we still are slogging though yet another crappy season of Grey's Anatomy. Wish the world had better taste."
4,SGU-2,"Nice, going to drama and keeping the universe intact. But where's the humor? It's what kept me watching the other two series. Other than that not bad, but science fiction drama is not what viewers want to see or expect from StarGate on SciFi."
1,Only 1 Star because there is no option for NONE,"The idiots cancelled Stargate Atlantis for this cheap, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly filmed rip-off of Battlestar Galactica. Okay, Atlantis wasn't great, I even hated it at first, but I got around to watching it, and it was 10 times better than this shaky-cam soap opera which stole the brand name of 'Stargate.' It has nothing to do with either series which came before it, nor the movie. It is full of utter stupidity, and they wasted time, talent and money making this crap. I hope to god this isn't the end of Stargate, but thank god it is the end of Stargate SGU. I've never been more pissed off about a sci-fi franchise in my life, this idiotic mess was doomed from the beginning, and the appearance of Jackon, RDA, and Carter are nothing short of disturbing and bizarre...as if they'd re-written their characters in order to stick them in this crapfest.Lost was better than this idiocy."
1,Region code not specified,I was very excited to receive my Stagnate universe DVDI was very disappointed to see it has region code 1 on it. the code was not mentioned on the amazon web site. common guys we live in a global on line community now. get out of the dark ages.I now have a DVD I can't play.Please put region code specifications on all DVD products and can the movie makers stop using this outdated technology.its passing your valued customers off. why can't I play a DVD I purchased in one country in my DVD player even if I move to a different regionNOT Happy
1,Left Hanging,"If you are/were a fan of this show, do not buy this. The show ends horribly and you are left wanting more. Save yourself the heartache and trouble and wait to buy this until (if) they announce movies to fulfill the storyline. I can not be more dissatisfied with the way this show ended."
1,Shaky-camera sux,"For some reason Amazon invited me to review this product, although I hadn't bought it. THIS REVIEW IS OF THE SERIES AS BROADCAST, NOT A PARTICULAR PRODUCT. I gave Stargate Universe a few minutes when it first came out on BROADCAST. I have the entire SG1 and Atlantis series, but SHAKY-CAMERA SUX! Whoever got the idea that filming like someone with a nervous condition is good cinematography should be flogged with a roll of film! Some critics of my review feel I shouldn't say anything at all, as I haven't bought the series. I disagree, as my opinion of the camerawork AS BROADCAST precluded me ever considering buying the series, as I did SG1 and Atlantis. IF I HAD BOUGHT IT WITHOUT EVER SEEING A REVIEW OF THE POOR SHAKY-CAMERA CINEMATOGRAPHY, AMAZON WOULD BE MAD AT ME FOR SENDING IT BACK! MY ""REVIEW"" OF THE SERIES, NOT THE SET, IS TO HOPEFULLY HELP OTHER PEOPLE WHO FIND THAT TYPE CAMERAWORK UNACCEPTABLE AVOID MAKING THE MISTAKE OF BUYING IT!"
4,Slow start probably killed a great show.,"The first season of this show was truly fantastic. Unfortunately, the first 5 episodes of this season were pretty slow. As is the case for cable shows, if it starts slow, it loses people, and the decision to kill it comes quick. Really too bad as this ended up being fantastic. The ending isn't great as it is obvious they expected another season. I'd have loved that as well. But if you have the first season, you need this one."
3,Not Good Enough,"Well, as a sci-fi junkie, I can get into just about anything, and this was no different. Once you plonk yourself in front of 6 episodes in a row, it's quite engaging and the acting is okay and it's shot and produced well. It's probably the most mature stargate in the series and that's probably why the fans deserted it. Because it wasn't MacGyver in space anymore, but it also wasn't as good at Battle Star Galactica, which it was clearly [ahem] 'influenced' by."
1,What happened to SyFy?,"This is an amazing series but was canceled way too prematurely. The SyFy channel is being ruined by canceling some of,their best shows. I will not buy this and support this channel. What a shame."
1,Don't buy these in bulk you will never finish more than a box... trust me.,"Disgusting down to the very last piece, please don't buy this item!!!! Please don't buy this item!!!! Waste of money."
2,Not satisfied,I didn't like the way these tasted. They have an artificial aftertaste. I also think an artificially flavored frosting with sprinkles of artificial dye is not a healthy choice for children (and it even doesn't make the tarts taste better). I'm eating them all so my toddler won't have to!
4,like it,"good, it has good quality and reasonable price. I strongly recommend it. It is worth for your money~~~, I like it"
2,Not for learning.,"This toy is VERY silly in my opinion. My 1 year old revceived it as a present. You would think it would either teach colors or say something about stop and go, but no. It only makes silly noises and has a very short ramp and tunnel for the car/train to drive on. The plane attached can be pushed around in circles but that is all. I just don't like this toy and won't be keeping it for long. Don't know why they made it."
2,Save your money for something better,Very simply...not interesting to any kids I know. My child would rather use the car as a teether than play with the set. We gave it to our child for Christmas and it's the only toy that has gotten zero playtime. There arer much better toys out there!
2,Barely been touched,"I bought this for my one year and 3 year old boys for Christmas, it's July now and they've barely touched it. My mother in law picked up a huge Little Tikes set with ramps, cranes, and tunnels at a yard sale and they loved it. I bought this smaller version hoping it would fit the bill as a replacement to the set she has at her house, but in a smaller form. I was mistaken, as they've probably spent about 10 minutes playing with it in the last 6 months. It is made well, but they just aren't interested in it."
2,Not that interesting,"Reviews are great to check before you buy. This toy was received as a gift. We have 3 kids 1- 3 1/2, and this toy is just not interesting, even for a day they were not interested. We also received ball popper toys and they are wonderful. Everyone loves them."
1,Not Great for Sure,"This is such a disappointment. I was so excited to get it because I had seen it on Baby Einstein. My child could care less. The airplane should move easier, and you have to really push on the buttons to make the lights come on and to make the sounds work. It might just be mine, but the red light only works when it wants to. When I took it out of the box my sister and I just kept saying, ""It has to do something. It just has to do more than that."" But it doesn't. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,Boring,"This toy is pretty disappointing. The Button lights work when I push as hard as I can, not easy enough for my toddler to do himself. The airplane doesn't do anything. The noises that the railroad sign makes are cute, but overall my toddler is board with this within 5 minutes."
1,Child won't play with it,My son got this for his first birthday. He has NEVER showed any interest in it. I wish I would have saved the box to take it back
2,Not worth the money,"My 11 mo old son loves cars so we got this for him thinking he would love playing with it. He played maybe 15 min. with it before he got bored. He's had it for 1 week and has played with it maybe 2-3 times. He does like the toy car and train that comes with the set. Before you spend your money, let them test drive at the store."
3,Not very entertaining for my son!,"This toy was bought for my son for xmas this past xmas. He was only 7 mths old so we waited alittle while to put it up. Well, it's been up for 3 mths and he hardly plays w/ it. My 3yr old daughter will play w/ it from time to time much more often then my son. They really only like the car and train that come w/ it. It mainly takes up space. I would have to say this is a toy you would want to take you kid into the store and see how they respond to it before buying. I personally would not have bought it. There really is not point to it other then to make noise. I would rate this toy as just ok."
2,take a pass,"I think the idea is good, but it just isn't made right. The two vehicles that come with it are supposed to roll down the hill, but they don't! You have to push them, and just the right way, to make it work, not something any baby could do. Also, the sounds are fun if you can figure out how to make them, but I prefer the baby to earn a response other than just noise. Nothing really happens here, so it sits and takes up space."
2,Just not that much to it...,"We purchased this toy, as a whim, for my son's 2nd Christmas. Thankfully it was just a side present. With the traffic lights and train crossing signs we thought he would spend a bit more time with it than he does. I pull it out occasionally and show show him the colors on the lights (and use it as a traffic light when he gets on his trike) and he does, occasionally, play with the winding ramp. But since the 04 Xmas he's only wanted to play with it less than a dozen times."
5,Makes me proud to be a girl,"She's awesome, immensely talented, and very inspiring. Her voice reveals emotions in a way which drives me to listen to her day in, day out. I've had the cd for about 2 years and I've yet to tire of it. Thank you for existing, Alana."
3,NOT HER SONG,I would like to say 32 flavors is not Alana Davis's origional song so don't give her credit for the lyrics or melody IT IS ANI DIFRANCO'S WORK. It is on NOT A PRETY GIRL which came out before allana's album. One highlite of her work is how much shorter hers is than ani's but besides that it is not as good as the origional so first buy ani's album. Thank You
3,Realistic portrayal of Natural events,"Entertaining, absorbing yet totally realistic potrait of all things to do with Nature."
5,Anti-Parasite Medicated Food,"I received this on time, with no hassles. It seems to be working well with my fish."
3,Useful content but defective binding,"If you are interested in Fischer Tropsch technology this a great book.But the book is expensive even for a reference text and it came with a defective binding.And when I sent the defective book back and received a second copy, it also had a identically defective binding... Obviously, the printer must have had problems with the binding machinery for an entire batch of books."
1,Adobe put a 4.0 cover on 3.1 recycled content,"Although I generally like Classroom in a Book, if you have already done the 3.1 Tutorial, don't bother spending money on this one."
3,"Good overview, lacks details on how to start a new document","Although this book covers a lot, it does not detail how to create a document from scratch. It does not thoroughly explain how to set up templates and master pages. The tutorial has you work on existing documents rather than start a document from scratch, which is what I would prefer."
4,A good way to be introduced to FrameMaker,"This tutorial served as a great way to be introduced to using FrameMaker. I had never used FrameMaker before. The tutorial touched on all the main features of the program, providing a comprehensive overview. However, the tutorial is lacking in several ways. For one, the lessons give you steps to follow to accomplish a specific task, but does not explain the why's of these steps, resulting at times in confusion as to why something was done. Also, the lessons often integrate various functions into one long step, and little attention is paid to one particular function. Many individual functions are never even covered. (This last aspect of the tutorial is, again, why I believe that this tutorial primarily serves best as an introduction to the program.) Yet used in conjunction with the FrameMaker User Guide, Classroom In a Book serves as a simple and handy counterpart."
2,Don't expect to be up and running after doing these lessons,"I faithfully completed all the lessons in this book then attempted to create my first FrameMaker document from scratch. Within five minutes I was stuck and didn't know what to do. I should add that I am not a computer neophyte. I am a software developer by trade and I am an experienced Word user, some would say a power user.This book gives an overview of the basic features of FrameMaker and leads the reader through exercises on existing documents. I would have found the book more effective if it had started at the logical starting point, creating a new document with a simple one-sided layout. Each chapter could have introduced the same features, but by building on that original document."
4,Helpful even for veteran Frame users,"If you already own or use a copy of FrameMaker at work, and you need additional skills in using the software, or want to learn more of the powerful features Frame has to offer, this book will be useful to you. I can't say how helpful it would be to a new user, but for anyone who's been muddling through by learning how to use Frame on their own, this book will teach you many things you don't already know, and will help you create better-constructed documents. Remember to practice on documents you create yourself (from scratch) or the lessons won't stick."
3,Buyer beware!,"This tutorial REQUIRES that you have Adobe FrameMaker 5.5 installed! So, there is no cheap way to learn FrameMaker. This tutorial should come WITH the purchase of FrameMaker.-Jane Austen"
2,cd-rom does not re-create the GUI,"My review was originally for a ""Classroom in a Book""of another Adobe product (Framemaker). The ""Classroomin a book"" one for Framemaker was a bit uselessbecause the CD provided with the book did not recreatethe GUI of Framemaker, which means that you need tohave the complete Adobe software before you actuallywant to try to learn it. Shouldn't it be the otherway around? First learn, then buy?"
1,UNKNOWN LANGUAGE,"MY HUSBAND BOUGHT YOUR BOOK A WEEK AGO AND HAS A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH IT, BECAUSE THE COMPUTER HE'S ON HAS DIFFERENT SYMBOLS THAN THE BOOK DESCRIBES. HE'S HAD TO CHANGE HIS CAREER FROM BEING A MODEL MAKER TO NOW LEARN THE COMPUTER SIDE OF THINGS. YOU NEED TO COME OUT WITH A BOOK THAT SHOWS THE SYMBOLS TO THE COMPUTER PROGRAM ."
5,atmospheric!,"this is one of those albums i can play and be in awe, when i play this i imagine myself standing at the edge of a forest with the sun peaking through the trees, and see myself in a field on a cloudy day with beautiful trees in the background, good music here to let your mind wonder and relax."
2,abe ought to be ashamed of himself,I thought WOW an abe laboriel dvd after veiwing a few minutes of it I wished I had not. A player of abe laboriel's caliber should be ashamed of himself putting out a dvd/vhs like this. He really brushes over a lot of topics not focusing on any one for more than a minute or two. He does do a couple of good licks which is why I do not give this a 1 star but really a bad product.
2,Not very helpful,I purchase this video and the Flea video with River Phoenix. I actually learned some techniques from the Flea video. I learned nothing from this video.
1,Abraham! Say it ain't so!,"Abraham Laboriel is probably my favorite musician, so it pains me greatly to write this review. But this DVD is horrible.I was under the assumption that this was an instructional DVD. It is not. The only instruction we get from the entire DVD is basically to play from our souls. HUH??? How is this helpful for beginning funk bass players? There's no technical direction in this DVD at all. After having watched it, I am no better at playing the bass guitar than I was before I watched it. Sure, Abe plays a few incredible riffs, but you can get that for free on the web. I don't remember ever being this disappointed with a DVD in my life.I'm sorry Mr. Laboriel. You're still my favorite musician and I respect the heck out of you. That's why I was expecting so much more from this DVD."
1,Potty training for boys,It was useless. It was not compatable with my DVD player. Or my computer. This has happened before with DVD's I purchased from Amazon.
1,Dont waste your money,I would not recommend this to anyone. It is not DVD it doen't work in all dvd player well not mines. we tried it on a computer and it just foot notes and links to other sites for baby products. do not buy please
2,Not A Bruen Fan,"This is the first book I've read by Ken Bruen, and it will probably be my last. He certainly has a way with words, but his protagonist's angst is laid down with a trowel. I also found the character repellent. I normally like literate heroes who can wield allusions well, but this guy's no Spenser.What bothered me most is that the case that was supposed to be under investigation was submerged under the weight of the main character's misery. It's as if the author only occasionally remembered what the book was about. That's a shame because my primary motivation for reading it, is because it deals with the notorious Magdalen Laundry. I don't think this theme was prominent enough to be mentioned in the title. This book should be called An Addict's Ruminations."
4,Good news Bad news,"The Garmin III+ does everything the ads say it will and It's fairly easy to use. Some book work is needed ,but it's fun stuff. If you like maps and navigating you would have to look pretty hard to do better than this model. Now the bad. The software you might have to buy is way too expensive and the ads lead you to believe you get a external ant. You do not. It costs almost a hundred bucks and you need to have it to get the most from the III+ model."
4,Harmon GPS III Plus,It is a shame that this model is no longer produced as it is perfect for applications like quad riding or bycycle riding. I like it so much that I bought a second one to have against the day mine might fail.
5,A wonderful traveling companion,"This unit is a wonderful traveling companion. It locks onto the sats quickly and is very user friendly. I really enjoy using it on trips in the vehicle. It also works very well when walking. I also enjoy the downloading capability from the mapping software I purchased separately. I enjoy being able to review my trips via computer, and even printing them. I make my own topo maps of various places.I have had the unit now for over a year. It is reliable, accurate, and alot of fun. You never have to worry about getting lost when you have a unit like this with you.This would make a wonderful gift for anyone."
1,I was just about to buy it but.....,"I was already getting out my credit card when I was made aware of the fact the Garmin has no intention of supporting its products and consumers with mac based downloading capabilities.... With a unit taunting high-end, up-to-date features, I say, ""Get with the Times, Garmin! "" Mac owners worldwide will appreciate a company that cares about them!"
4,This was my first GPS,"This GPS has been mounted on the dash of my Explorer for well over a year. Being my first GPS this one has always been my favorite, but the small amount of RAM is a bit of a problem for me these days. I typically use the MAPs from the ROM, but I also have several regions loaded from Garmin's Roads and Recreation CD--though not as many as I'd actually like. The features on this unit are great and the screen is very visible. With the bean bag mount, you can position the screen for the available lighting without any trouble. If you're thinking of taking this hiking, I would recommend the eMAP (8 Meg of RAM) or the ETrex Summit (better outdoor features). For heads up vehicle navigation, the GPS III is the best choice."
4,When you really need to know.,"We train search and rescue dogs in Colorado and map griding is extremely important to what we do. We use this little puppy on a regular basis and it is quite accurate.The down side is as already mentioned, low cell life. So carry an extra cell and you should be fine."
3,The Family is not as strong as previous efforts,"This was a long time coming. After Del's previous two hot releases I was sure this would at least match them in intensity. If you are a true Del fan, you'll want this if only for a couple of tracks. Perhaps they were out of breath after the effort with Steve Earle."
5,This band push all the right buttons,"I haven't listened to the album , but I saw the band along with Steve Earle last evening in Dublin,Ireland. What an amazing evening - we don't hear enough Bluegrass in Ireland but these are the greatest. As a traditional mandolin payer I'm seriously re- considering my allegiances, Don't miss them."
3,"Good for the scholar, not for the beginner.","This book is an excellent resource for those who already have some basic understanding of the history of marxism. However, for those who are looking for an introduction to this history, this book is not for you."
4,"Nice bag. Does not fit a 17"" screen","Nice sturdy bag. Excellent built quality. Has a lot of pockets for smaller item in the front. Can easily fit a mouse and charger plus many other things in the last compartment. Has a sleeve to keep your laptop safe, and is actually very handy.However, I got this bag for a 17"" widescreen laptop. This bag was advertised as ""Fits 17 inch screens"", but the sleeve cannot fit a 17"". The bag can fit the size, but does not have any cushions or protection to safeguard your laptop. So I use it for another 15"" that I have.Excellent for travellers... it fits into the overhead bins of smaller aircrafts too. Because of the many pockets and compartments, the bag is very bulky. The roller is sturdy and has a long handle. I use the bag only when travelling and use just the sleeve locally... works for me!!!"
5,Very convenient case,"I purchased this laptop case a month ago. I was looking for something convenient and light to relax my back and to follow me across many airports in the country.So far this case has delivered: wheels are great, it is light and sturdy, the case for overnight shirt can include gears for 2 days if you pack up tightly and the small laptop bag is very convenient and light.Great product that I recommend especially since I had a $50 discount."
5,Just what a traveling person needs,"this rolling laptop case is great. It has plenty of pockets for just about everything you would ever need for. I like how those pockets are in a bright orange, a nice contrast from the black that covers the outside. I have a 15.4"" laptop and it fits perfect in the little zipper case. the pocket itself will hold up to a 17"" laptop. which is good if you ever upgrade, you can keep the bag. the materials look and feel like quality. the handle comes up and goes down with no trouble and has it's own zipper to conceal it if needed. I went from a bagack that hardly had any room to this roller that is now half empty because of all the room i have."
5,Walking the Bible,"The DVD ""Walking the Bible"" is a really great documentary that takes you through the Holy Land in conjunction with the Old Testiment. It is extremely worthwhile.Walking the Bible"
5,A very interesting documentary!,What great perspective and a nice approach. Interesting for all religions and even those with no inclination towards religion at all.
1,Watch Out,"I did not care for this DVD. I did until the comment was made that Jews, Christians and Muslims all share the same God. Also later a reference made that man walked the earth for a million years-maybe if you believe in evolution-which I do not. I would be careful on this one."
5,"Powerful, yyet Humorous","An excellent read. The character are developed in such a way I feel like I know them, and I cant count the number of times I laughed out loud, nor how many times I cried. The only downside, it is very hard to put it down, plan on staying up late to finish it."
5,A Wise Choice,"This is a very good CD. I have both parts of Having Good Old Fashioned Church and the latest Sounds of Pentecost. This music is very spiritual and what I call a ""pick-me-up"". It would be a blessing to have in your collection."
4,"Add mango, coconut milk, and vanilla. Enjoy","Make dessert with this rice. It's sticky and, on its own, just faintly sweet. Mango rice, rice pudding, or whatever rice dessert you like. I think it would also work well, barely salted, in sushi, but I haven't tried yet; the stickiness and texture at least are perfect for sushi and rice balls.If you're using a rice cooker, find the places where the steam condenses on your cooker, and clean those areas extra thoroughly after making this rice. Like all sticky rice, this rice has a starchy steam that will make a mess if you don't clean it up."
3,????,Dont know how to rate this. It shipped 2 days later than it said it would. Said I was suppose to get it by July 3. And I still havent gotten it. Im sure it will be good once I finally ever get it.
2,GE Nighthawks,"Not very bright compared to others, such as Sylvania SilverStars. Slightly better than standard halogen bulbs, but not worth the extra money since you won't notice much difference."
1,Did Not Fit Toyota Sienna,"I ordered Silverstars for my Toyota Sienna and NightHawks for my Dad's Sienna. The Nighthawks did not fit his car. The wiring harness has a ""male"" alignment tab that is supposed to slide into the ""female"" slot in the bulb (as in the stock and Sylvania bulbs). However, these GE bulbs have the male tab instead of the slot, making it impossible to plug them in - the tab in the plug hits the tab in the bulb. Had to return them..."
3,9005?,"Bought three sets when the buy 1 get 1 free deal was on. My first set I bought were 9005 {high beam} they are outstanding. The 9006 {low beam} didnt seem any better than a regular bulb. I also bought the 9004 {high/low combined} and again they were no better than any other bulb.I dont know why they are so high but seem to last awhile, had 1 9004 blow but light leaks and blows everything,not GE issue.. I'll buy 9005 style again maybe but since HID kits are lower in price now I'll go with them before that. The rest seem no better than a cheap bulb from walmart or parts store."
1,"Designed in Germany, but MADE IN CHINA","Addition information on this product. Haba has excellent products, but they are not all made in Germany. This item was designed in Germany, but it was manufactured in China."
5,A perfect flower girl dress,I was looking for a inexpensive but high quality dress for the flower girl in our wedding and that's exactly what I got when I purchased this dress. I was nervous what it would like but when I received it I was pleasently surprised. The ivory was a little darker then the picture showed but it will be perfect. It does take a few days to process but they tell you that and shippment after that was quick. I would say I received the dress within one week of ordering it. Overall my experience was great I would order from them again.
5,PRECIOUS!!!,"This dress is just precious. It's such a high quality, beautiful dress!!! It will be the perfect flower girl dress. I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone. It is perfect for an event such as a wedding, pageant or even as an Easter dress. You won't be dissapointed!"
2,The flowers on the dress are glued and NOT stitched,"I loved the review of this Dress and ordered it for my daughter. when I received the dress, I inspected it. I was disappointed to see that the flowers on the dress are glued and NOT stitched. I intend to return the dress if Amazon is ready to reimburse the shipping charges. Although, looks wise this dress it quite good."
5,Well Done,"Detailed, extensively referenced and put into a cogent form that makes Tecumseh's life understandable, and interesting reading. It's hard to find much fault in this book, except for Eckert's persistent marketing of his other books in his amplification notes, which can be ignored easily enough, if it bothers you. A true and great Indian leader and decent human being, Tecumseh deserves much more praise than he receives."
1,Too complicated,I found the book too complicated. Trying to remember all of the Indian names and other characters made reading this book unpleasant. I usually like historical novels...but I gave up on this one.
1,Product Decsription is False,The product description attached to this product states it is for 13-17 inch TVs. However the product shipped to me was for 25-27 inch TVs. When I attempted to return the item Amazon told me it was not their fault and the shipping costs would be deducted from my refund.I will never shop on Amazon again!
3,A Sweet Nostalgic Escape,"Gwen Stefani's ""Sweet Escape"" (a collaboration with Senegalese rapper Akron) is a bubbly tribute to '50s music. It sounds like a song that would flow from a jukebox, with waitresses on roller skates and malteds served up. ""Sweet Escape"" has some inane lyrics about spoiled milk, but it's not worth crying over. It's a fun song.The second song,""Hollaback Girl"",is an awful cheerleader anthem with useless cussing. It's worth skipping.This album is half-good. Menza menza."
4,Motorcycle sized jumper cables,"These cables are just the right size to keep handy on your motorcycle, if you have panniers.I bought these, compact cables as insurance. My electronic ignition bike wouldn't bump start, but it fired right up off jumper cables!"
3,Big Ben Alarm Clock,"I have had this for a little while and it keeps good time so far. The picture of the clock shows one that was made in USA, but the clock I got was made in China so I am worried about its durability since I got a Chinese one that lasted less than 2 years and my American made one lasted 17 years. The clock looks differently from the picture as well."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"I bought these earring for my daughter. I was going to purchase an expensive pair but she saw these and wanted to buy it. I took a chance, after all the price was very affordable and when she received them, she loved it. She wears them everyday. Very satisfied purchase."
5,Really stunning earrings in a believable size.,Very pretty earrings. I bought several and gave them as stocking stuffers. Everyone loved them!
4,7mm Round CZ,"I purchased for my wedding in May, they not only look beautiful, they are just what I needed for that extra little sparkel. They can quickly and with no defects or flaws in the packaging. Can not wait to wear the in May."
4,Beautiful,These earrings are beautiful. A bit larger than I wanted but they are very nicely made and the sparkle is beautiful.
4,Nice and Cheap,"Okay, so I was looking around to buy some nice classy diamond earrings and came across these. Duh, they are not diamonds, but they are very beautiful. The light reflects off of them with so much brilliance and for only $3, who can complain?I only wish these came in white gold instead of sterling silver from the same trustworthy company.I'm still looking for my perfect pair of diamond earrings, but for now, these are a very dazzling substitute."
3,Shiney Earrings,I was a little disappointed in the quality of this studded earrings. I love the size of the stone but the stones in both earrings seem to be a little lose so I am sure they won't last long.
5,Clarity at such a great price! You cannot tell if they are real or not!,I thought the $2.99 price would make them very cheap glass but instead find them gem quality and a better clarity than the real thing even in sunlight. I tested it to a 3 ct real African diamond!!!
2,better job with the earrings,"the earrings r nice ,but the back part r 2 small 2 put on [2 small for the hands]not good!!!!!"
1,fell apart,I had them for a week and the gem started to get loose and then finally it fell out after about a week and a half.... DO NOT BUY THESE!
2,7M Sterling Silver Clear Cubic Zirconia Earrings,"Initially I was happy until my son wore them for a few months. Then I wasn't really impressed with them. Yes, they looked nice and sparkly. BUT they turned my son's ears a nasty color. I had to buy another pair of Sterling Silver ones somewhere else for roughly a couple of dollars more and they have Not turned my son's ears strange colors. Makes me wonder what kind of ""Sterling Silver"" they were."
4,7mm CZ earrings,"Great buy! Very bright, sparkly! They tend to hang down because of their size, weight and small earring back/clasp. Recommend using a larger (disc) back."
4,Nice earring for the price.,This is a nice cubic zirconia earring that passes for a diamond. Big enough to be noticed but not big enough for people to stare. They look like they will last a few years anyway so overall good purchase for the money.
5,nice!,Just what I wanted...these earings look like $1000 studs to everyone and only I know how affordable they were! Highly recommended!
5,"Watch for free, then buy the DVD","I am here at amazon buying this DVD to send this as a gift. I know they'll love it. I have watched this online several times - it is perfectly legal to do so - but as you can see from the other reviews, many people buy the DVD for many good reasons (they may not enjoy or be able to watch online, they may not know about it being online, they may want to physically have this in their collection, they want to support a different way of producing movies, etc).This movie is a lot of fun, but like so many fun things that are also unique experiences, it is not for everyone. My suggestion: watch the trailer or one of the segments online (easiest way it to search for the title at youtube), then you'll know if you want to fork over the money.This movie has music, legend, comedy & tragedy; wrapped in imagination and eye-popping animation. *This* is why you got that cool movie-watching set-up."
5,Movie's fantastic - BUT THE SOUNDTRACK - LOVELY,Of course the movie is totally great. But I can't say enough about the soundtrack. It is just enchanting. I've watched it about 4 times. Thank you Nina Paley for a great gift!
5,Sita please sing some more!,"Bring it on Amitabh Bachchan and move over Shahrukh Khan, there is a new modern stud in town, Ramayana in the internet sensation Sita Sings the Blues. It is easy to sit down and fall beneath the spell of the animated multi media film. However the strung together story that switches between the modern day and the ancient past is more then the Powder Puff girls 20 centuries ago. The film takes on an old popular Indian epic legend and stirs it up creating a film that transforms the story into an Indian diaspora feminist epic narrative. Exciting for all audiences, the film takes music from Annette Hanshaw throwing the audience into a Bollywood mind set, but captured into the American past. If you want a film that is full of complex dimensions but also a film to giggle along with your friends, I suggest sitting down with the romantic tale of Sita and Rama."
3,...,"Ok, I'm not a real anime enthusiast, though I was into it when I bought this. It gives you an ok grasp of the basics, but it seems a bit out-dated.If you're begginer, get it, if your not, don't, because you'll probably be above this books level.Also, warning to those few...There is a warning in this book which I think I should tell those few who think they can be an anime artist over night...The book says that it can take years to be good at this stuff, so, just feeling like warning you..."
1,BE VERY CAREFUL!!,"If you are about to buy a didgeridoo and considering buying this stick, you are probably way off knowing where to get a proper instrument. If you want to get yourself something which can be called as didgeridoo, simply go get a plastic pipe of about 1.20 cm which wont let you down. However, if you want to buy a real didgeridoo, you have to know that almost 98% of all didges are NOT made in Australia. There are made in Indonesia or Bali mostly using timbers like Teak by drilling the log. They are notorious crackers!An authentic, Aboriginal made didgeridoo(yidaki/Mago) is not impossible to find.(Not everybody has to play an authentic instrument though!!) Do not a buy a fake product claimed to be original! Show respect for Aboriginal people."
1,Not a Real Henrietta,Not a real Henrietta the Chicken. I have bought several over the years. This one was HARD and broke in half immediatley.
1,NOT FOR HEAVY CHEWERS!!!,"PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE THIS TOY WITH YOUR DOG UNSUPERVISED!We gave our Silky Terrier this toy. He weighs 12 pounds and he was very excited and loved the toy. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS, 45 seconds after we gave it to him he Chewed the Foot OFF!! This toy is not very durable and easy to chew through. I'm not buying anymore dog toys online! I am buying from the pet store!I DO NOT THINK YOU SHOULD BUY THIS TOY UNLESS YOUR DOG HAS NO TEETH OR DOES NOT LIKE TO CHEW!"
2,LOVED IT,"Yes they did, It was a blast to watch him with this toy not sharing with the others. For the whole 10 minutes before he bit a hole in it let the air out and stopped the noise......It was almost worth it anyways..almost...."
5,Literally her best friend!,"Collene the Border Collie LOVES this toy, Henrietta is her new best friend! She carries it around everywhere! Whenever I put it away at night so I can get some sleep, she would find it eventually and cries until she gets the chicken. Collene was a little shy at first with Henrietta but now she goes crazy for her! It's a toy thats worth the time for every dog. :)"
5,Our Bulldog's favorite toy!,This is by far the best toy we have ever purchased. Porkchop loves it and squeaks it non-stop! He's had it for about a month and won't play with any of his other toys. Henrietta is a winner and we will be buying Chicktoria as well. Highly recommended!
5,Very Handy Unit,"I have used GPS units in conjunction with chart plotters in our boat, which is what caused me to consider this unit. This unit has a few drawbacks, such as it is very hard on batteries (get the 12 volt power cord)and it sometimes takes slightly longer to acquire satelites. While this is not the ""turn by turn"" GPS system found in Hertz rent a cars upscale cars, it is also a fraction of the price. We use this unit for navigating our race team's semi truck to race tracks we have not previously visited. It is particularly handy to have a second person ""running"" the unit since it is not a turn by turn unit. For the money, it is a good unit and I would purchase it again."
1,disappointed,"After trying to use this product for 2 weeks, and having two other technically savvy friends try to help me, I finally gave up and sent it back. The documentation was nearly impossible, the interface not intuitive at all, and the labeling systems for buttons misrepresentative of their functions. For example, to go back a menu you must push the ""quit"" button. The hardware and accuracy may be good, but unfortunately I didn't get the chance to know since the usability made it impossible.The system includes detailed maps of one region. I was unable to download these maps, and upon return to the site, I was told that I could only use my code once and that I had to re-purchase it. I contacted customer service who was very unresponsive and who never responded to any of my requests for two weeks.If you are looking for an ""out of the box"" product, you will be disappointed."
4,Works pretty well,I have been using the SP III for around a year and it has worked out great. I would agree that battery life leaves alot to be desired. The other thing I would like to see is Macintosh support or an open development platform so others could write for the Mac. I carry around an old laptop when on the road in my RV just to update the GPS. It works great and gives you confidence while traveling in unknown areas.
2,disappointed,the product seems to lack what i want ill stick with my laptop although i would of liked to have a compact easy to store unit in the car. amazon did the best job and showed the best pic of the unit on the web. will be back when it gets better
4,"Good, but missing lots of data","A previous review mentioned StarBucks, for some of us it is a MUST to stop every morning. In the Southern California area there are NO Starbucks listed in the Streetpilot 3, I was very disappointed.The street directions are very good and can get you a an area or an address. Getting to one of the built in locations is diffcult. I was in the Altanta/Alpharetta area and asked it to take me to a Burger King. After 20 minutes of driving back and forth, up and down the street I couldn't find it even though the GPS kept saying I was passing it. I went someplace else, on the way back I passed the Burger King on the opposite side of the street, 1/2 a block from where I was.Garmin needs to verify it's data and addresses or dump this function."
2,Not worth the price,"Some of the things I didn't know. You do have to pay for upgrades to the maps you've already paid for, I had read you didn't. It doesn't reroute well. If you miss a turn because the GPS is off your on your own, it takes the unit too long to catch up. It doesn't do well unless your on the Hwy. I was in a major traffic jam and needed to reroute, it couldn't do it. I eventually found my own way. I almost tossed the GPS on more than one occasion."
5,The best book of rider studies,"This book....what can I say? It literally is the best book written on riding I have yet come across. Ironic, isn't it, that I am not an English rider, but a Western rider and still found this book to be of great help. Yes, help. It describes in graphic detail what you should really understand before even thinking about mounting a horse, plus tips and guidelines on what you should know when you do mount a horse.I really did find this book invaluable. I have owned it for years and I'm still learning from it. I find it absolutely great for references.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who rides horses, and to those who don't, just so they can truly understand the significance of horse intelligence and human/horse companionship."
4,Good but not great,"The reception did seem to improve a bit but the picture still appears grainy when you look closely at the screen or on network stations. The picture appears to have improved more on the cable channels. I think if I connect the amplifier closer to the dish as opposed to closer to the receiver, I should get a better picture. If you bought a high quality big screen TV but wonder why your picture is fuzzy/grainy, this might be the answer for you. I thought the satellite was the problem and I almost got digital cable which is much more expensive. I am glad I found this product first."
4,Step By Step,I ordered the book and it came propmptly. More promptly than getting Office 2000 loaded on my machine. It looks a bit more simplistic than what I was looking for but it looks like a great book for someone just getting started.
4,Very useful,It is a little outdated now; but not by much... It still had everything I needed to know in it! VERY ALL INCLUSIVE!! Thank YOU!! Good price too
2,Big Disappointment,This one should be left on the writing room floor. Has some information in it but not nearly enough for the price.
3,An entertaining read that goes no where,"The concept of this book was pretty obvious - ripoff and then rename the heroes from the DC universe (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc), and then write a ""what if"" story with them existing in the real world. The concept might sound lame, but it resulted in a pretty solid book. The dialogue is great, but the pacing is awful. You finish the book feeling like next to nothing has really happened, and if you're unlucky enough to read the 2nd volume, you'll see that the story is probably best left unfinished."
4,Thorough survey of mathematics,"One of the most thorough surveys of mathematics I have read. Tends to concentrate on algebras. Too little on probability and statistics. Also somewhat dated for anything near cutting edge. Nothing on computer science or computational theory, for example. For a newer survey, esp more on philosophical and applications, though less on how it is done, you might try Davis & Hersh, The Mathematical Experience."
4,"cute & durable, but sounds are annoying","I wanted a cute bank for my daughter & found this adorable piggy bank. My son, who is 3 1/2 has a bank that he loves and wanted his baby sister to have one too. The bank is cute and durable! The only problem with the bank is that when coins get stuck in the slot the sound doesn't stop and it is very annoying. Overall, we love the bank, but find the sound to be unnecessary."
3,Not one of Howell's best! Spoiler,"I usually enjoy the Highland stories but this was a little disappointing. Story-Kidnap Murrays (Avery and Guilyanne) used to settle a score with Payton Murray. Cameron MacAlpin believe his sister was seduced by Payton and now tries to seduce Payton's sister Avery. Long journey and then decide to give up virginity to Cameron who ""hates women"" and will never trust again. The way Cameron treated Avery throughout the story as property and how they come together in the end was disappointing. After all she went through I would expect her to fight a little more before she gives in and marries him! He gets her drunk in the end and she wakes up married, WTF!"
5,Highland Knight by Hannah Howell,"I loved this book. The heroine has heart. She's bold, honest and even though she is small, she has her wits. The hero admires and is even a little astonished at her abilities. I enjoy a book that doesn't make all women out to be some tissue snivelling weaklings. I read it 3 times, and laughed each time."
3,Japanese dimmu borgir,"E.D.M are very disappointing, or at least this album was. With many websites boasting there ""unique"" style and ""cult"" status, I expected more from this album. Shortly before the bands demise I began to hear rumors about them and how alternative they were to the black metal scene. Well, in japan they may be different, but in America, they're just another Dimmu Borgir knock off, with tastes to rival LA band Sothis, this band falls short of any true black metal expectations. In short, do not waste your money on something I can guarantee you'll just sell back for that next Wintersun album."
4,Great Bag,"The bag does not accomodate my 17 inch Dell, although the description says that it will accomodate a 17 inch. However, I love this bag. It has a great feel and I will use it for other things."
3,It was interesting...,"The title song is a complte downer. However, ""You N' Now"" is a great song that I would give 5 stars to. If you are thinking about buying this cd, buy it because of the song ""You N' Now"". It is tight!"
1,Stone fell out,"These earrings are indeed beautiful, and I loved wearing them for the few hours before one of the stones fell out of its setting. I don't know if this is common or a one-time event, but be warned. I'm hoping to exchange for another pair and that this is only an anomaly."
3,Very good value,"This is my first GPS receiver. I had intended to buy the etrex, but this was on sale at a local marine supply for [...]. considering that it has 19 savable routes (plus the active route to make 20) and 500 waypoints and each route can have 30 waypoints, and many other features that I don't see on the etrex, I decided to spend the extra [...]. I'm glad I did. this is an excelent starter receiver if you can spend the extra [...]. it doesn't do maps, but I buy USGS maps for hiking anyway and I don't need this for city travel."
4,Hi Quality - Large User Community,"An excellent and rugged machine, I've used it in teaching for two years. The only drawback is the relatively poor resolution LCD. However, with free software, such as WayPoint, you can easily convert to high resolution graphics."
4,Great GPS,"I have had a GPS 12 since about 1996 and used it extensively without any problems. It is a great, solid, reliable unit. I have mountain biked, hiked, drove, geocached and backpacked with it.I heartily recommend it to anyone needing a good basic GPS.My only complaint about it is the battery compartment isn't waterproof. This has never been a problem for me, even in the rain, but it seems it would have been simple to make it so it could handle accidental submersion better.Now I am handing it down as I have recently received a Foretrex 101 for Christmas and love it even more, and it cost even less."
3,WARNING - NOT IDENTICAL TO ORIGINAL 1959 BOOK,"I was so excited to see Adelaide, a great vintage children's book by Tomi Ungerer, back in print. That said, when I just received my copy from Amazon, I saw it had been changed from the 1959 version my daughter had checked out of our local library. While the story is essentially the same, just be forewarned that the wording throughout has been changed in many places.The most notable is the change to the ending:ORIGINAL:The director gave her a signed paper releasing Leon. They were married soon after. Long live the happy couple! Leon and Adelaide had many children. With her fine family and good friends Adelaide was completely happy.NEW VERSION:The director gave her a signed paper and Leon was released. Soon, they were married. Leon and Adelaide had many children - they were the most striking family of kangaroos the world had ever seen! Adelaide was truly happy and realized that her adventures could have only happened with her special set of wings."""
2,Just ok.,Insert a standard stick of butter and it will touch the top of the lid. That makes a nice mess. Hello? Isn't the height of a stick of butter a standardized thing?
5,A most excellent album,"I wish I'd known about The Beautiful South well before I first stumbled upon them. I know I'd bought one of their albums back in 1995 but never really listened to it much. Pity poor me!This album is almost like a live recording. I do have one of their concert DVD's which I think is a fantastic thing. This is a very good collection of songs and if you've really enjoyed listening to their music, this is a good addition since their back catalog doesn't include a true ""live"" concert album.Sorry that they broke up, that is for sure!Enjoy!"
2,Buy lots of extension cords!,"The lights are beautiful, but the nowhere in the product description does it state that the light set is only 9' long and you can only string 3 sets together."
2,Pretty but short and faulty,"The lights blink really well, but it generates more heat than my other lights, is VERY short for 150 bulbs, and the mid-section would not light up at all. Returning this product!"
5,A must have for playing Mutants and Masterminds,"This is quite possibly the best RPG sourcebook I have picked up in my 5 years or so of gaming many different systems. It gives you a complete run down of the town, it's heroes and villians."
5,Built to last and last.,"These things are bullet proof. Reinforced strain relief and heavy molded jack bodies. They are not cheep and not built cheep either. When the success of your sound system really counts, don't screw around with stuff that will fail. Stick with Planet Waves adapters."
3,Songs aren't familiar,"The singer on this CD has a pleasant voice. But if I were shopping again, I would buy a CD that had more familiar songs on it, or songs and melodies that I would be able to remember and sing to my baby (although I don't have much of a singing voice, he doesn't seem to mind!) I just can't relate to lyrics like ""grow up like the gilly flower."" Many of these songs are lullabies from different countries (Rumanian, Irish, Yiddish, etc.)"
1,UPS sucks.,"Never showed at my house. Went to BNSF, and they sent it back to UPS. The box finally came, but was opened, and verything scattered."
5,My favorite Cinderella book,"I believe I was about 5 years old or so when I got this book. I treasured this book as a child when my mother gave this to me. I was fascinated by the beautiful illustrations, particularly the very pointy shoes and big poofy sleeves on all the women! The story is the same classic as always, so of course there's nothing wrong there. This is such a gorgeous book though when you compare it to the typical old Disney look. The illustrations in this version truly make this book. I wish I knew what happend to my original copy. I can't wait to get my hands on this again for both myself, nieces, and maybe a future daughter of my own!"
5,lovely illustrations,"being an amateur artist,i was mostly interested in the drawings and i was delighted to see such detail on every page. i think the era represented is the 1820s? or 1830s?. a lot of thought went into this and i praise the artist! very good work. enjoy."
4,"Safe, effective exercise for Breast cancer/ Lymphedema","As a certified lymphedema therapist, I was interested in learning more about the Lebed method, and have already started incorporating these moves into the exercise programs I give my patients. After seeing this DVD, I am thinking about getting certified in Lebed method. I would highly recommend this DVD to people with upper or lower extremity lymphedema, and those treated for breast cancer who are at risk for developing lymphedema. The exercises are slow, safe, and effective and the instructor has a positive, upbeat attitude that it makes it fun. Also includes instruction on diaphragmatic breathing to stimulate lymphatic duct, and the importance of wearing compression while exercising. I hope to see this DVD become a series!"
4,Stretch,Slow paced arm workout for breast cancer/lymph node surgery survivors. Relieves pain and tightness through exercise. Those confined to a chair would also find the workout out useful.
5,Fantastic boots!,I got these boots for my 11 year old daughter. She LOVES them and they are so comfy and practical. Fashionable too. They are more than 1/2 the price of UGGS and I find them more solid (the sole is strong and thick - great for New England weather). I'm going to get a pair for myself!
5,AWESOME,"These boots are awesome. They are really comfy and toasty! The only thing is that they recommend (because they only come in whole sizes) that you round up. I am a 7 1/2 so I got the 8 and I think they are a little too big, but if you wear a heavy sock its okay. I had a problem tripping over my own feet the first time I wore them, but the comfort far out-weighed that issue:-) All I can say is why would you pay $200 or more for Uggs when you can buy these?Caron"
4,Great boot for my Wife,I ordered this boot for my wife for Christmas. I came about a week after I had ordered it. That was 2.5 weeks before Christmas. She like the boot. But it was tight on her feet. I had to return it. I don't really like having to pay $10 shipping to my house and pay another $10 to ship it back and another $10 to have the exchange shipped back to me. That's $20 more then I wanted to pay. I would not of minded the cost to ship it back. I just did not think it really worth spending half the cost of the boot in shipping. Be Sure to order a Full Size Larger to avoid this!!!
4,Not for me but great boot overall,"They didn't fit me great and they were a bit stiff but I can see how people would love these boots. They were shipped to me fast (Amazon Prime Member) and they were a great deal but for me I love the feel of super flexible and comfy shearling boots and these were on on the stiffer side which would be great for people who needed them for doing more outdoors rugged stuff instead of just strolling around which is what I wanted mine for. All in all, I recommend them or the brand at least. Quality boots for sure and Amazon ROCKS."
5,Good quality,"quality is very good. Be sure to order 1 size bigger than your normal size. I am normally 8, and 9 is perfect for me"
1,lack of customer service,found it very very hard to reach anyone in customer service to return the item. of course they had all excuses. i won't shop again
4,Bearpaw Boots,Very warm and comfortable. Bites at the back of my heels a little bit but otherwise I love them!! Would definetely purchase again.
3,Step up from the Pawz by Bearpaw but still not UGG,"I sent back Pawz by Bearpaw and got these in place of them. Definitely better quality, softer, warmer. My one complaint, the calf space is tight on ONE of the boots causing it to be slouchy and look a little strange because Im not able to pull it totally up. The other fits fine which could mean my calves are lopsided or the boots are made different. Either way, for the price these are decent boots. Still not my Ugg's but they are good boots"
3,warm and fuzzy,love the boots. they are worth every penny. they are a bit snug fitting around the calf but with every wear they seem to be loosening up a bit. would purchase again
5,Very Nice Boot,"Bought this boot for my daughter after recently purchasing some UGG Boots for myself and have to say, very impressed. Am ordering a pair for myself. The price is incredible for such a great boot. Very comfy too."
5,Great Deal! Beautiful Boots!,Love these boots! Tall enough to wear with jeans tucked inside. Quality feel. Deep black color. Great Quality!
4,Not UGGS but close enough,I bought a size 9 (I wear an 8 1/2) and had to return them for a 10. The 9 fit but I wanted to wear these with a heavier sock and the 10 was more comfortable. I only wear these inside so I can't comment on the wearability outside.
4,Bearpaws are Not For Me!,"I have to admit that I loved these boots when they arrived, and how they looked with leggings. They are truly nice boots at a good price. My problem is that Bearpaws don't fit me well. They are too short in the toe area, and too large in the heel. This keeps my foot slipping in and out of the boot every time I take a step, and my toes hurt in the process. I tried placing inserts in the heel, but it didn't correct the problem. And, I have purchased four pair of Bearpaw boots to see if this problem would exist in other styles. It did. I hated to return these since they looked so cute, were warm on my feet, but I had no choice. I just wonder where I go from here since I haven't had any luck with Uggs, Emu's, but am wondering about the Born Shilo. Think I'll give them a try and hope for the best!"
2,TOO TIGHT !!!!!,"They look good and qualilty appears decent, BUT they run small...I wear 8.5 and the 9 is tight. In addition, the top portion, which reaches the calf is too tight and mind you I'm 5'6"" about 145 lbs, so I am very average in size. You have to be a stick figure to wear these boots...very disappointing."
1,Small,I typically wear size 6.5 in women's shoes but at times I'd order a 7 because my feed are wide. I ordered a 7 in these boots and felt my toes crammed against the tip of the boot. This has never happened to me before. I had to return the boot and end up paying for shipping. I wasn't allowed to exchange for a bigger size.
5,Really outstanding,"Bought these for my daughter, a collage student. I didn't want to dish out the price of Ugg's but have seen some rather pricey, really awful boots that are simaler to UGG's.The quality and especially the lining on these boots are outstanding and I cannot tell the difference between these and Ugg's. Except the beautifully reduced price.I recommend you buy these. My daughter loves them."
1,cheaply made in China,Was totaly surprized by the quality of these boots!! MAYBE THEY ARE KNOCK-OFFS! A Bearpaw box I have never seen too! Flimsy is what they are!! I have alot of Bearpaw Boots- these are crap!
4,"Comfy, but not weather proof",Boots were as described. The fit is good and they are warm. The bad part is that they are suade and will mark with the wet snow and slush.
4,great value and comfort,"don't waste your money one uggs. these boots are super comfy and warm, and at a fraction of the price."
2,not good,"Well, i returned them, they suppost to run small so I ordered one size bigger , but they were too big for me, in the calve they were too tight and the sole were kind of soft. Didn't like them at all."
4,calf area is too narrow : (,I loved the boot everything I was wanting except that the calf area is too narrow so they don't fit. I am tired or sending boots back so I am just going to try and cut the seam and rig them myself : ( oh well
3,review of black snow boots,"I like these boots, but they are not as high quality as I would have liked"
2,Not worth it,"The samplers in this book will remind you of the 40+ year old stamped cross stitch pieces you used to be able to buy in the local 5 & 10. The charts are very basic and the floss colors used to complete them are less than flattering. Unless you are a beginning stitcher and are just learning this craft, don't waste your money on this one."
5,Fearless,"I would like to begin by saying that this was one of the most emotionally and personally important films I have seen. Period. I echo the sentiments of Julie Pierce, in that the use of Gorecki's 3rd Symphony in the film, particularly at the end -- played without any other sounds or dialogue -- is one of the most effective (and, emotionally moving) uses of classical music I have ever heard in a film.The film and the music cannot be separated; you see the one, together with the other, and you cannot forget either.We live about 10 miles from where Alaska flight 261 went down off the coast of Ventura County, California, about a week ago.See the film. Listen to this soundtrack. It cannot help but make you give pause, and examine what is really important in your life."
2,I used to love these guys...........,"Saw them in San Francisco on the Cake tour, loved most of their stuff since then. Great hooks, witty lyrics, nice variety of upbeat and slower songs. This is just mellowwwwwwwww almost all the way through. They're not THAT old but this is an album to be played as elevator music."
2,"I really really wanted to like this one, but.....","Now here's a welcome surprise at the CD store, a new Trashcan Sinatras CD, after all these years. I thought they had split up, but here they are again, so this is a no-brainer, I know I'm going to like this one....but playing it now as I write this, I find it quite a letdown. It took 8 years to produce this? The same band that gave us the glories of ""Cake"" from out of the blue, with the witty lyrics and chiming choruses, the album I played over and over for weeks after I bought it?The problem is, none of the songs stand out at all, just one fey and low key song after the other. I wish I could say a song or two did stand out, but it just washed over me, like elevator music. These guys have plenty of talent, so what happened? None of the songs seem to get started, rather like a continual intro that has been stretched into a 3 minute song. Even after a couple of listens, it doesn't really come together. And that's a terrible waste."
5,Better than ever,"If you've already discovered TCS, you need no encouragement to get this record. If you're new to this phenomenal band, I can only say that you are in for a real treat. The word ""crafted"" may have connotations of calculated perfectionism, but in this case, it means, created with attention to nuance, detail, and quality. Honestly, the first song is the only weak moment here. The rest exudes a rarely-heard-of regard for (again) craftsmanship and care. Rife with melodic surprises, poetic lyric twists, themes that blend the melancholy with the lighthearted, and most of all, a musical and vocal performance that must be heard to be truly believed and appreciated, this is easily one of the best albums of 2004."
5,LOVELY CD TCS!,"IF YOU LIKE REAL MUSIC ON REAL INSTRUMENTS YOU MUST HAVE THIS! THIS IS THE JAPANESE ISSUE WITH 1 EXTRA TRACK. DOWNLOAD THE LYRICS FOR THE LYRICS ARE CRYPTIC. I LIVE IN THE NETHERLANDS, HEARD 1 TRACK AND BOUGHT ALMOST THEIR WHOLE OUTPUT IN 2 MONTHS! THIS BAND EXISTS 21/22 YEARS! BUY IT OR BUY THE 2 DISCS SET WITH A DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Garden Time Organic Semolina Manicotti, 7.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)",I was looking forward to the opportunity of purchasing Organic Manicotti Shells but unfortunately found they would split down the middle when filling. My experience wasn't successful--Not sure if it is the manicotti or the cook -- I am going to try again and shorten the cook time to see if there is an improvement.
5,worth the wait,"While my 5-star review is probably a little higher than what I'd like it to be (It's not quite as good as the first record), it'll do.Anyway, this album is probably tied for my favorite of the year, so far. As for how it sounds in compared to Alone I Admire (the group's first album), it's not as instrumentally driven, but a bit more poppy. Almost all the songs have vocals through out. Also, like their last album, there's also a 10-minute extra track that's unlisted. Though, regrettably, the new 10 minute instrumental is quite as great as the one on the last album, but the earlier tracks are stunning."
2,Not good from generator power,Won't charge if the generator isn't very steady. Clicks off or charges at lower current; in turn the generator sees varying load. Case has no solid mounting surface. Doesn't like to pass through AC at higher current than it can invert. Draws too much with no load (wish it sensed when load is on). Sounds intermittent when inverting although it works ok (cosmetic issue). Battery voltage indicator doesn't seem to match my voltmeter. Not meeting expectations (especially that it doesn't like to charge).
4,"What you see, is what you get","I received the Garmin 12CX for Christmas, replacing my older Magellan 2000XL. The Garmin is definitely a more versatile unit, having the ability to upload/download topo map waypoints and routes. However, the color display is difficult to read unless facing the light source. I am also not completely satisfied with the contrast adjustments for the colors. When you get a good contrast with one, the others seem to be ""washed out"". I would like to see more icon symbols that are related to hiking rather than boating. The icons can save time in establishing an easier method to find a saved waypoint. Overall however, I would say that this unit is very user friendly and has a much better use (with power saver) of battery power. I will be using rechargable (1650 mah) AA batteries in mine to save $ over the alkaline variety."
4,Amanda's flats,"Bought these for my daughter who fell in love with them the minute she saw them. Sugar Shoes is a popular brand name amongst the teen+ age group..mod and trendy, good quality products."
4,great fun,"This puzzle was a big hit at a New Year's gathering of 50-60 somethings! Everyone got involved including people who ""don't like puzzles"" because everyone knew the content. The actual images are not the best but the puzzle was so much fun it didn't matter. More challenging than originally anticipated...referring to box picture was a must on this one."
4,jigsaw puzzle fun,This puzzle was fairly easy and quick to put together. Lots of fun identifying tv stars and remembering shows from long ago.
3,"Fun, but drawings are cheesy","This is a fairly difficult puzzle as you're trying to match up so many faces and with the way the puzzle is cut, it's a bit more difficult to match up pieces which I liked. The drawings on the puzzles are suppose to be cartoonish, but some are really bad. Overall, a fun puzzle, but better if below the $10 mark."
5,Fun puzzle,My sister-in-law received this as a Christmas gift and the whole family became involved putting it together! Lots of fun and a great puzzle. I would recommend it for anyone who loves puzzles.
2,Straight Garbage Fo' Sho',"I gave this read two stars only for the first chapter that I had read in the book The Game:Short Stories About the Life. It lead you to believe you really had a juicy story to follow. Well wrong answer this book had a very good plot but the author did not know how to tell a story. If she did Dollar wouldn't have been so stupid. Just doing dumb,mean and evil stuff. I wouldn't recommend this book as a street book because it seems like the same ol' same ol' without any positive message."
4,YOU GO GIRL!!,I really enjoyed reading this book. Keep doing what u doing and never mind what the haters say... u know the haters always gon' hate. This book is wassup. Much success Joy!
3,Grimmy,I thought the book was good only for the simple fact that the ending was the best part. Besides that everything was predictable yet I give the author props so I supported him and Triple Crown Productions.
3,Dollar bill,"Good Read!!!Dollar Billl took the streets by a storm. He was giving life back,,,only to go back to during the same things that put him in that element."
2,More Propaganda,"I was issued this book in an education class while in college. If your child is attending public schools it behooves you to know how the teachers are being programmed by the universities. This book is feminist drivel and ridiculous to the point of hilarity. If you want to confuse your children by conditioning them to play in such a way opposite of their natures, and you are out of touch enough with the way children play together, and you want your boys to have long hair and wear skirts (why not? let's be equal!) and your girls to get a flat top, this book is definitely something to stock in your shelf next to your copy of The Communist Manifesto. On the other hand, if you want a good laugh with out of date philosophies, this book will still find a place on your bookshelf, right up there next to The Communist Manifesto."
5,so sad,So sad that they cancelled this show and we have to buy a video to see how it ends. I loved this series and this movie was worth every penny.
5,Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars,"The movie was delivered faster than expected. This allowed my wife and I to have a Saturday movie date to, in essence, wrap up the ""Farscape"" series. We have watched all the series episodes and the movie added a very nice touch in completing the saga and yet left us wanting to see more. I plan to get the complete set when I have some extra money. We did enjoy it."
5,farscape: the peacekeeper wars,have watched all four seasons of farscape. really enjoyed the series. peacekeeper wars was avery good ending to the series. i wish the series would have lasted more then four seasons though.
4,"Could've been better, could've been way worse.","I followed this entire series and loved 90% of it. The movie was a little over dramatic, some of the voices did not sound the same..(Pilot) and they changed a couple of the character's appearances without giving any explanation. I was going to love this no matter what, just because of my love for the show, but it was very obvious they were trying to crunch in too many things last minute."
5,Only the best - where have you been?,"If you are a fan of sci-fi and have never watched Farscape, you need to do it RIGHT NOW! Farscape is flat out the best science fiction series ever created and The PeaceKeeper Wars wraps it all up. Get it now. Do not stop at go. You will be proud to have this movie in your collection."
4,Farscape,I loved this show. This was the conclusions to the series that they didn't get to do when the show was cancelled.
5,Brilliant!,This was a great ending to a great series. A MUST See! All those who loved the series will enjoy this one. Do enjoy!
4,Farscape - The Peacekeeper Wars,"This DVD is really good. I got angry at the end of the Fouth season when they left it like that, but the DVD Movie was good.Greatness is short lived, but true Genius lives forever!Jackie Chapman"
3,"Good movie, bad disk.","I bought this dvd after watching the series on Netflix. It arrived on time and seemed in good condition, but one part of the disk kept freezing and had to be skipped over."
5,"Ah, closure","I'm glad that Farscape had the chance to wrap everything up with this excellent film that gives fans the closure they need. One or two cast changes can make viewing a little jarring, but I can't hate anything Farscape, so 5 stars it is."
4,^_^,"Great conclusion to a great series. You have to be a fan of the show in order to care about this miniseries, but I'm a fan of the show and I cared about this miniseries."
3,farscape conclusion,"This was the conclusion to the series made later on, too long after the series was cancelled. They did a good job of concluding the story, however the majic of the regular season episodes was partly lost and it seemed like too many battles and not enough drama. Too bad the sci-fi channel cut it down in it's prime. Farscape was one of the best shows ever on TV."
3,peace keeper wars,"it wasn't too bad, live up the the series, lots if action and is well worth watching.how ever its also the type of movie you proble only want to watch once."
2,Has some promise but misses the mark terribly.,"There are parts of this science fiction drama that are genuinely entertaining and well done but it fiercely misses the mark. At times I thought I was watching the Muppets. The characters go from one impossible situation to another and the story goes nowhere. The ""pregnancy"" scenes were so poorly done that I wondered how the actors could keep from laughing out loud while doing the scenes. Then, saying it all, when it was cancelled, someone in authority is videoed (in the extras ) speaking to the cast saying it was the best @#$%^& SF series ever made. Wrong. It is one of the worst. Thespians at their worst!"
2,Confusing,"If you are a fan of the Farscape TV series, you may well like this movie. I have never seen the series and found The Peacekeeper Wars to be confusing because it assumes you know the history of the characters and story line.Although I have found other Jim Henson productions engaging - I especially liked Labyrinth -- I found this one to be seriously lacking in depth of character. They were walking paper dolls. Only 'Pilot' showed any real personality.There was a plot twist at the end that I found interesting - even ironic - but it wasn't enough to redeem the movie. I'll be putting this one back up for sale: not a keeper."
4,Farscape: Peace Keeper Wars,"Was it ideal? No, but in fairness to the series, it was as good as the powers that be were going to let Farscape finish at the time. The dialogues/commentary needs to be listened to, they explain better what happens at a corporate level than anything else can. Watch it and enjoy, and if you needed more of a fix start streaming Stargate reruns to see more old characters."
4,Farscape finale,"A treat to see a Farscape movie -- good production values, compelling story lines and as usual -- great characters."
5,What's Everybody Talking About?,"I had never even heard of Farscape until this miniseries was released. I never saw one episode. In fact, I didn't even have a satellite dish during the show's run. But when I sat up late one night, around eleven, I caught an encore of PART ONE of THE PEACEKEEPER WARS. I was hooked. This movie is really impressive. Oh, I'm sure the richness and the love for the characters would be stronger had I seen the previous episodes. But it's really not that important. I understood the whole thing. Give it a try. It's a least worth a rental to the uninitiated sci-fi fan. I liked it anyway. The plot is really detailed, but you'll get into it if you open your mind. A couple parts might be inappropriate for younger viewers. I was dissapointed with a few coy remarks. Other than that, it's good, fun entertainment."
4,One of the best but could have been better...,Farscape is one of the best Sci Fi TV series ever done & this set is nicely packaged. However I was disappointed at the ending of the movie (I would like to have seen more of what happened to Chiana & other characters) & the 2-disc set is lacking any kind of insert in the package. Also there is no information on the box or the disks of what is on each DVD so you have to assume the mini series is on the 1st disk & the extras on the 2nd. The series was great but the finale needs another story.
3,Almost Ruined,"Well I liked 90% of this. Unfortunately the birthing scene nearly destroyed this almost perfect ending to Farscape. I have always enjoyed the sly humor in Farscape, but this scene wen't beyond campy into the realm of downright cheesy. Other than that, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and the space battle scenes were right up there with anything Mr. Lucas has done."
5,Good wrap up to the series,"I recently got into the series, and was disappointed to find out it only spawned for 4 seasons. Did hear there was a movie however not certain I was up to watching it as most movies to wrap up a TV series usually fail to meet with the expectation and standards set by the series. This movie did not... it was exactly what it was meant to be, one giant episode to wrap up most of the major arches. Now with that in mind it does leave some questions and potentials for the future. Very happy with the purchase, just wish there was another one or two movies of Farscape to enjoy along with this one."
5,Where O Where Do the Good Ones Go,"I am so glad that they were able to complete the series. It was one of my favorites. Although why a race Of Peace keeping negotiators would reduce Crichton and Aeryn to little bits was a stretch. The Sci Fi channel used to run real series with charachter development and plots, Now they just have crap like ghost hunters.Farscape was original, fun and imaginative!"
4,Farscape come back,Why are the good TV programs gone. This is the closing of Farscape and it kinda lets you hanging.Maybe they need to do Farscape Generation next.Just like Star Trek they end a good show.
4,Was a good finish to this series.,I hated having to buy the ending after listening to all the seasons for free. The quality of the DVD was just OK but the price was cheap enough anyways. The story line was good and made for a satisfying finish to the show. Nothing worse than like Kyle XY being left hung without answers. Seeing Stargate before this series made this interesting for me too. The extra features on the DVd were just OK.
3,IMHO,The video was what I remembered. But the sound and video quality left a lot to be desired about half way through.
4,Glad to have,"Well. with the show gone it's good to have anything at all.. The Actors, Designers and Directors never disappoint .. still can not figure why this show went off the air."
5,Peacekeeper Wars,"This final episode of Farscape was fitting for the cast and crew. It brought together the original actors in a 3 hour climax in order to complete this science fiction series. In the true since of Farscape, the Henson Company delivered on the mark.After their reassembly, John Crichton and Aeryn Sun are thrown into one more final fight to save their friends, themselves and the galaxy from a war between the Scarrans and the Peacekeepers. This last three hour chapter in the Farscape saga has action, romance, special effects and sadly, the demise of one of the Farscape characters. If you are a Farscape fan then this DVD is for you."
4,entertaining but long.,i enjoyed this DVD but was somewhat annoyed that the video did not have any breaks as it is rather lengthy show in this instance. but it does wrap up the series quit nicely
5,A Great Ending to A Unique Series,"If Farscape fans couldn't have more Farscape, they wanted closureto the most unique series to come along in many an arn. This movie did that and more. Great sadness and great joy made a great ending for a fantastic series.T.L. Thrasher"
1,Not arrived,"To date, I have not received my order. Was made a month ago, and I still do not know what happened."
2,no subtitles,"There were no subtitles. It's not just this item, it's all movies. I won't purchase many other movies at Amazon until subtitles are available."
5,Perfect for every Farscape Fan,This movie was a long time coming when it was created. The original show was cancelled before the whole story could be told. The fans got together enough fundage together to convince the company to make this movie to finish the story.All in all it is an action packed movie from beginning to end. Lots of awesome special effects and all out war. Great for not only the Farscape fans but also anyone that loves action and scifi.
5,"Cool movie to wrap up the series. Not as good as the show, but I'm happy they did this for fans.",There's no way they could leave us hanging after the fourth season. I'm very glad they made this movie to wrap up the show.
2,Fell apart in one washing,"The set is adorable, but the comforter fell apart in one wash. The stuffing started coming out. It really was disappointing to my daughter."
2,Avoid due to inferior sound quality,"The recordings in this collection are magnificent performances; unfortunately, they were transferred at the wrong pitch many years ago, and this error is carried through on this set. However, you may obtain the most recent and far superior transfers on the ""Lee Wiley Completists' Collection"" available on the ""Devil's Music"" (Ted Ono's Baldwin Street Music spinoff) label. If not avaialble on Amazon, it's worth searching for the complete series."
3,"A few creative mixes, but not much to speak of...","The Cure's 3rd single from the Wild Mood Swings album, Strange Attraction (the maxi-single) has 2 really cool remixes Gone (critter mix) and Strange Attraction (strange mix), one bizarre mix (The 13th--feels good mix), and 1 that is hardly discernible from the album version, This is a Lie (ambient version). Unless you're just a really big fan of this song and don't want to drop ""more money"" for the whole album, I wouldn't recommend this CD."
4,KUDOS TO TINA MOSS,"I thought this book was very well written. The storyline kept my interest throughout the entire book. The characters were entertaining, and well thought out. They were very likeable. I found myself rooting for them to beat the odds and come out on top, which they did. I would definately recommend this book to readers of all ages. I can not wait to read it to my own children."
4,Spellbinding,"all I can say is... wow. I started reading the series because as a kid I enjoyed Anderson's star wars books (hey what are you doing, please put away the pitchforks and torches) and i wanted to see what he could do in a universe of his own.Like the rest of the series this book has enough logical inconsistencies that the sci-fi snobs will hate it, but they are probably too busy re-reading I, Robot for the 537'th time anyways. For those of us who read for a good story this book is absolutely worth it, because this book has a hell of a good story.Anderson wraps up plenty of the storyline so you really get a good sense of closure for this part of the series, but enough ominous loose ends exist that I'm sure the next two books will be as much a roller coaster as the first five."
5,Exciting Series,I could not wait for the paperback to come out - The Sage of the Seven Suns is full of suprizes and a good read. A must read for those looking for excitement and entainment! I'll be look for more in this series and or just other books by the author!
4,"Why the wait, and then the wait...???!!!","I have been reading the series from the start, but I only read the paperback versions since they're more portable. So I ask: why do these publishers make you wait one year or more for the paperback? I can see it's to force the impatient to get the expensive hardcovers, but don't they fear lost interest from those who will not buy those. I can't remember how many series I've left behind because I couldn't wait or lost track of.I can understand the wait for the author to complete another volume in the series (and I wish they would write a little faster...!!!), but then to wait again for the paperback to come out gets maddening....!!! I'm glad they provided the sneak peak on this book..."
2,Of Fire and Night,I have read all the Dune books and enjoy good sci-fi. Nevertheless I could not get started on this book for the highly detailed introduction with all the strange names. Perhaps if I had read the earlier books my review might have been kinder. I might do that yet.
4,Review for Introduction to TYPE,"I found this book to be about what I was looking for. I have taken the on-line test before and have downloaded the material about each type. I now teach a class on ""Temperament, Personality, and Spiritual Gifts"" and used material in the book for my classes. I would like to find a more in depth study on this subject, but it did give enough information for me to help my class understand the test after they were given the test by a friend who is qualified to give and score the test."
3,Track plans for model railroaders with some experience.,"Each of the 48 layouts is presented (typically 2-4 pages each) with a concept description (why build this layout this way and/or how it is operated), a scale track plan, and a perspective drawing of the layout (or a featured scene from the layout). These are not track plans for sectional track, they do not have step-by-step assembly instructions (Kalmbach Publishing has other very good ""track plan"" books which take that approach), and the plans do not come with a ""parts list"" to build them. Almost all of the plans are for modelers with some prior layout construction experience and are intended to give you inspiration for your layout design, or as an intermediate-complexity track plan to build as your layout. For those modelers interested in track design, it presents a wide variety of different layout design approaches by dozens of other modelers."
4,Good starting point,"Book has a lot of 4x8 plans in it, along with a handful of shelf types and large layouts. The plans are not the step-by-step method. If you want to be walked through every step, then don't get this book. However, if you have some experience, most of the plans have track section joints marked so you can figure out what it is you need. I used the book to get ideas for my medium-sized layout, taking things from all sizes of layouts. This book is probably more geared for the intermediate modeler."
5,Everything I had hoped for.,Classic book of plans. Good advice on how to plan for any sized layout. Has been read and reread several times already.
3,Good idea book,"As is typical for most books of this type, the layout plans presented are far bigger than most model railroaders can realistically hope for. Still, one can glean lots of useful information that can be winnowed down into a workable plan."
1,Worst model railroad book I have ever come across,"I generally love the books from the model railroader magazine, and have bought more than a dozen but this on e was dreadfulIt seemed to mostly be bad photocopies of pictures and illustrations from magazine contentSave your money there are a lot of good books out there on track layouts and planningI was able to return mine!"
3,TYPICAL FARRAH MOVIE,"I LOVE FARRAH FAWCETT...FROM CHARLIES ANGELS UNTIL TODAY AND BEYOND. HOWEVER- THIS IS A TYPICAL FF FLICK WHERE ONE OF THE CHARACTERS HAS HIS EYES GLUED TO HER THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE AND NO NEW GROUND IS BROKEN. IF YOU SAW SILK HOPE OR SUBSTITUTE WIFE- THEN YOU SAW THIS. ITS JUST GOT A DIFFERENT SETTING. ITS KILLING ME TO KNOW MS FAWCETT ISNT DOING WELL AND WE MAY NOT SEE HER IN ANYTHING NEW. SO, THIS APPEARS TO BE A HARD TO GET ITEM. MAYBE YOU SHOULD GRAB IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HER IN HER PRIME. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER FARRAH FAWCETT JUST AS THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER CAL RIPKEN JR. AS THEY SAY: "" WHEN THEY MADE HER THEY BROKE THE MOLD."""
5,Criminal Behavior,"This is a favorite of mine. I bought it about four years or more ago and still watch it often.I bought it to see A. Martinez mainly. He and Farrah were awesome together. She was young and beautiful. The way they played off eachother was excellently done.There were many nice scenes with just Farrah.The story line is good, fast paced, good ending.I paid much for it but I've never regretted it."
4,Great product,"After reading the reviews I decided to buy this creme and It's an excellent purchase to condition damage and dry hair...but It's not a ""miracle cream"" (I confess I was expecting my damage hair after using it to look like the hair form a Pantene's ad but that didn't happened) But It is softer and very easy to comb and It has been a great improvement for my hair. It smells a little bit too much like olive oil to me but it's not bad (my super-picky husband haven't say anything about it so I'm sure is not strong).Overall I'll keep using it and I may buy the shampoo :)"
5,A miracle!,"Wow--honestly words cannot even describe how amazing this product is. I read about it online and had to try it. I have used so many products before in the hopes that it would restore my hair after all it has been through--it is dry and easily breakable, frizzy, chemically treated, and I use the blow dryer and straightener on it everyday. Nothing compares to this product. I could not believe how amazing my hair looked and felt! It was so smooth and silky, I couldn't stop telling people to ""feel my hair!"" It also lasts days as well--once a week keeps my hair in great condition. Even better to leave it on overnight. I would tell anyone and everyone to get this product. You will not regret it."
5,Gerat conditioner,I have been using this conditioner for five years and I love it. I have tight dry curls and this conditioner is a great moisturizer and it smells great.
5,"Butter, just butter!","BEST CONDITIONER EVER !!!!!!!!!! I use this every time I wash my hair (every 3-4 days, I do wash my butt). I also have an old-school electric heat cap I plug-in. What I do is shampoo hair with L'Oreal Natures Therapy mega moisture shampoo towel dry and apply mega moisture conditioner; wrap hair in a plastic grocery bag and sit with my heat cap on or, sometime just go to bed with the conditioner in my hair wrap a towel on and in the morning I rinse. Hair Bio: Hispanic heritage, wavy if dried with head upside down, really straight if I use blow drier and round ceramic brush. Closer to thin hair than thick but, lots of hair. I also, have long hair almost to waist. Hope this review helps you. BEST CONDITIONER EVER!!!!"
1,no good,"I love this product and regularly buy it, but this must be a defective jar... it doesn't smell the same or work as well."
3,IT LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AFTER A RECOMMENDATION FROM ANOTHER AMAZON REVIEWER WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT TO DO TO A EXTREMELY DAMAGED HAIR LIKE MINE.I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR THE LAST 4 MONTHS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JOYCO SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER AND TREATMENT, IT LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT AND IT'S RECOVERING SLOWLY., BUT I CAN'T SAY IS DUE TO THIS PRODUCT ALONE."
3,This conditioner is just okay.,"I've been using this for a few weeks now. Honestly, I think that it's a little bit better thanregular pharmacy conditioners. After using it, it does give a bit cremier and richier feeling.But it hasn't dramatically improved the condition of my hair.Also, I've found it very inconvenient of all the turning that I need to do to open and close the lid.It'd been a lot easier if it came in a pump dispenser."
4,Does its job,not fun to leave in your hair for the recommended amount of time and it works okay as a regular conditioner.
2,a common conditioning cream,i had high espectations on this product since there are so many good reviews. well i would think this works great if it names itself conditioner because that is what it is. smooth your hair but I havent noticed any improvement in hair texture. but still better than those super expensive bs products tho
5,L'Oreal Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Cream,It makes your hair feel sooo good. My hair is dry and this conditioner really makes the difference. I recommend it for all dry hair.
1,This product stinks (literally and figuratively),"I bought this product based on the positive customer reviews. I have curly, dry and unruly hair. When I opened the container, I was horrified by the nasty chemical aroma. It did nothing to improve my hair, and it slicks the tub so badly that I almost lost my footing. I contacted L'Oreal about a month ago and was sent a canned response asking for more information. No one ever responded to my list of concerns."
3,Crappy instructions on removing blade.,"Bought two, can't get the blade out of either... Someone, please enlighten me how this is done and I'll change my review.Edit:Ok, so the part that holds the blade needs to be at a 45 degree angle from the blue handle, and the blade needs to be pulled straight out (direction grey part is pointing). I'll up my review to three stars from one but this item still loses one star for having crappy blade-removal instructions and one star for not really holding the blade as tight as it could."
3,"Decent, but with a few major issues","This book is a bit confusing in its target audience. I'm assuming it's for fairly beginning players because it prints the hole diagram under each note on the staff. Because it's aimed at beginners, I'm surprised it doesn't include an audio CD- It's extremely difficult to sight-read Celtic music for rhythm without having heard the song (or a variant) before, and needless to say that would make it more for an experienced player (making the hole diagrams unsightly and distracting).However, the most egregious error is that by trying to fit about a song per page, the B sections of certain songs are omitted! The whole second half of Sí Bheag Sí Mhor was not included, and given that the B part is often the best part of the song, this is not a good attribute.Whether experienced or beginner, I'd recommend Gray Larson's line of tinwhistle books much more."
3,"""Everyday"" by M.C. Lyte","Lyte's fifth album, ""Bad As I Wanna B"" gave rise to three singles. They are: ""Cold Rock A Party(remix),"" ""Keep On Keepin' On"" and ""Everyday."" ""Everyday"" is an old-school flavored jam combining funky backdrop beats(courtesy of Jermaine Dupri) combined with Lyte's signature, commanding vocals. The tune also featured guest vocals by Kandi Buruss(of R&B group Xscape) who sang bits of the chorus. In brief, if you lean towards ol-school rap songs or are just a fan of M.C. Lyte, I would recommend picking this up. So if you want an honest and informative review, just look for the trademark name atop the reviews for other rap, hip-hop and R&B titles. ~Peace."
3,"Good if you're at all interested in Lynchburg, VA...","Having recently moved to Lynchburg, I came upon this book while searching for books about the city. It sounded interesting, and I was excited to read it. I will say that it was a decent book; however, I definitely had to plow through some parts. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that B. Thompson Stroud's writing is most likely an acquired taste. I feel it is worthy to mention that it was not only neat to read about some of the places I have come to know in this city--not many people write about little old Lynchburg--as well as have some amusing anecdotes about pop culture."
5,A great book by a very talented author.,"This is one of the most thought-provoking books that I have ever read. In the three days that it took me to read this book, I couldn't keep from thinking about it, wanting to know what would happen next. I have read many books in my life, some great, some not so great. Until I read Seven Hill City, I had never had such a cathartic experience.This author has a very real talent at making the mundane not so mundane. He represents small town every day life in a way that makes the reader feel he/she is in the middle of the story struggling right along with each character.I highly suggest this book to readers with all tastes! I cannot wait to read what Stroud comes up with next."
1,Totally unhelpful and a big downer.,"It's mindboggling that these authors found a publisher. This book touts itself as a full guide to living in Japan. This could not be farther from the truth. Lacking specific information about the process of finding a home, work, etc, it's basically a dreary account of all the difficulties that await you in Japan, with an intense focus on the psychological trials, which the book seems to portray as inevitable. Worse still, the only advice offered in coping with the pessimistic, matter-of-fact list of challenges is shockingly trite. I do not know why these two authors wrote this book, because it really seems as though their objective was dissuading people from living in Japan, rather than offering solutions."
3,"Great for mental well being, but not what I expected","An easy read based on the psychology behind coping, culture shock, and how it will affect you and those around you when you move to Japan, or anywhere else for that matter! Not very helpful as a knowledge base about actual life in Japan, but it is insightful regarding how our minds work when presented with an alternate reality."
2,These authors need to lighten up (a lot),"Wow- just reading through the excerpts they make it sound like hell on Earth. I've spent a decent amount of time in Japan and I can tell you these folks are giving Afghanistan or Darfur for a year friends, *that's* true misery. Japan is what you make it and for a lot of ex-pats it's a lot of fun."
4,BAJA DESIGNS CRF230 ENDURO LIGHT KIT,"Components of the kit are very well made, instructions could be much better and should be rewritten. Called tech support and the techs at Baja Designs were very helpful and understanding, after clarifying the instructions with their help, the rest of the install went very well. Rode for the first time in the mud and had no problems with the lighting kit after hosing her down."
1,Nothing unique,"I'll have to enter a dissenting voice, here. I'm glad to see that this book has been useful to others, but for myself, I found it boring and lacking anything new or eye-opening. The authors seem earnest in their advice, but they don't go into much depth about the challenges of marriage. It's feel-good candy for the soul, not the protein needed to sustain a lifetime."
3,Dora pillow case,"vey dissapointed, the material was very flimsey, and was torn down one side, not worth the money, your just paying for the Dora name."
2,Average at best.,"Sorry but this is just so mediocre its not even funny. Nightwish , Within Temptation , Epica and the new Forgotten Tales absolutely CRUSH this release. Some of the vocals are out of tune and there really is a lack of hooks , something Nightwish and the other aforementioned bands do NOT have. Anyone who thinks this is better than Nightwish obviously is clueless about real melodic metal and shouldn't review menus let alone music. Nice try but Alas , you have a long way to go. 'Nuff Said."
4,excellent prog metal,"I have seen some of the reviews below that simply baffle me. Those of you that so dislike this album probably would have despised PESTILENCE's ""Spheres"" when it came out as well over 10 years ago. Music like this may not be within ""mainstream"" tastes, but then again neither is SUNN O))) or SKULLFLOWER, but they are brilliant nonetheless. Rutan is trying to stretch the boundaries of 'metal' here and he grandly succeeds. If you are looking for instantly memorable refrains - please go back to your Dave Matthews CD's --- stay away from anything like this that might challenge your definition of music."
2,MeltDown,"Please,folks don't buy this rotisserie. There is a serious flaw in the design.1. The motor is plastic. The plastic parts melted the 1st timeI used it. In less than 5 minutes of use.2. Amazon should not be selling a product this inferior.Itwill come back and haunt them.3. This is the most ridiculous, poorly designed product Ihave ever seen. Plastic parts on a grilling rotisserie,Come On!"
4,Schoenbaum finds the one thing Hitler offered,"Hitler led the National Socialist German Workers' Party, yet allied himself with the Fascists. How could this be? What could he have offered to all the diverse people he attracted, workers, big business, middle class? Schoenbaum, analyzing carefully, discovers there was one thing Hitler did offer everyone -- blame. Decades later we all laughed at the U.S. television character Archie Bunker saying ""The trouble with America is THEM."""
2,Torture to read,"Schoenbaum's book is extensively researched. Almost every page has a list of social statistics from the Nazi period. But at the end of each chapter, I was so overwhelmed with details that I had no idea what the author had proven. Eventually I just gave up. Readers who are already very knowledgeable about Nazi Germany might gain something from this book, but people looking for introductory works should avoid it."
3,Selective German-Bashing,"Yes, Schoenbaum's book is heavily footnoted with a myriad of sources, but his subtly biased German-bashing drum beats in the background throughout the work. Objectivity is difficult to maintain with the memory of the holocaust being kept alive by the Zionist influenced media and film industry. Yet, scholarship demands it and this book disappoints."
4,Everything a single should be,"S-E-X-X-Y, not my favorite TMBG song by any means, is presented here in two forms: a 'radio edit' (the album version, basically), and the awesome Warren Rigg Microwave Mix, which starts off a bit boring but takes off after a minute or so. I actually like it better than the original version, although it's not as good as the World's Address remix.This CD also contains We've Got a World That Swings, a slow, melancholy song that I like very much. I guess S-E-X-X-Y #2 is a better deal, because you get two extra songs, including ""Sensurround"", one of my personal favorite TMBG songs. Oh well.Oh and P.S., the cover art on this thing is really, really ugly."
2,great stories--AFTER Page 35,"I received this book as a gift--If I had paid my own money; I'd have been severely disappointed. My heart goes out to Mrs. Fiedel on the death of her devoted husband--but I'm interested in GHOST STORIES (which is why my friend bought me the book) NOT ""My husband worshipped the ground I walked on"" stories. That saccarin-sweet story lasts, unfortunately, almost halfway through the book. The rest of the GHOST stories are interesting and a welcome relief. I think Mrs. Fiedel is a fine writer--but if she wants to write a book on her loving husband--then call it as such for those people who would love to read such a story and those who don't (me) will not have to purchase it and be disappointed. Being from Central PA myself, the ghost stories were very interesting and readable; but for half the ghost stories, it should be 1/2 the price. I'd rate this book--""Just okay."""
2,Short and light,"A short light book, mainly comedic look at the German culture but of no great depth. Amusing for a day's read but no real revelations."
4,Very Insightful Indeed,"I really enjoyed reading this book when I purchased it a few months ago. I used to live in Bitburg, Germany when I was small, and reading this book should help me when I make a planned trip back. I plan to read it again and recommend it."
4,Welcome to Reality!,"I am an American who has lived 22 years in Germany and can testify: this book may be funny, but it is TRUTH! It is an excellent cross-cultural guide. Enjoy a chuckle as you focus on the endearing foibles and frustrating traits of one of the most interesting peoples in the world! Must reading for any >>Anglo-Saxons<< contemplating studying, living or working in Deutschland!"
4,It gives hope to those without hope.,"This book talks about the deep dark secrets of what we do behind closed doors. Too embrassed to talk about it openly, we aren't able to get the help we need. Patrick Carnes not only tells us that we are not alone but shows how we can be healed of this addition.His recent book ""Don't call it Love"" carrys the same theme but more in depth."
2,Very In Depth About Severe Sexual Addiction,"This book is very informative about SEVERE SEXUAL ADDICTION!! Not for mild cases. was way too much more than i wanted to know. i would only recomend it if you are dealing with rape, child molestation, or other severe cases. not for the mild porn, etc...."
3,"Good secular approach, but not enough!","15 years removed from all the sex addiction (books, seminars, therapy, etc.) and reading this entire book numerous times I have come to realize that this book (among many others) still fall short of providing all the answers someone needs to recover from this addiction.Dr. Carnes takes the modern psychological approach to addiction in that man is inherintly good and that man is a simply a product of his environment. This helps to relieve one's guilt but is scientifically and observably incorrect. It is also contrary to the prescription that these same modern pyschologists provide the addict: the option to choose to stop. Thus, Dr. Carnes leaves out the most important reason why some recover and some do not: their will and their deeper understanding of where the temptation arises and how exactly to hinder or completely stop it.So, although this work was somewhat helpful it is completely lacking in its conclusion and helpful application."
5,Dealing with Sexual Addiction? Buy this book!,Fabulous book. Very helpful and gives lots of great info. Highly recommended!
3,Maybe good for some,"Maybe this book is good for people who are actually planning on entering a 12-step program, but as someone who read it just out of general interest, I found it to be incredibly repetitive, and felt the entire book could have been shrunk down to a 25 page booklet, including all the checklists and tables. There was very little actual material in the book, and it seemed every other chapter was a direct repeat of the previous chapter.It wasn't so bad as to not want to finish it (it took me about 2 hours to read it cover to cover over 2 days), but I will most likely be donating this book to our local library the next time I visit there as I won't be reading it again. There are probably better books out that address this condition than this one."
2,I didnt like it,I couldnt get into it. It wasnt what I expected. I thought it was one of those book that I would keep on reading. But I couldnt. It was boring not interesting.
3,Informational,"This is a great book. If you are struggling with addiction, this is the book to read. I highly recommend it to anybody that needs to feel validated."
4,Good Book,"I felt this book was a very good book, giving insight into the mind of the sex addict. It was at times difficult because as a partner of one, it opened my eyes to the potential of where this addiction could lead to. It provided some understanding as to how a person arrives here and some of the methods, including the 12-step program approach to recovery."
4,"Excellent, Thorough, Understanding of This Problem","I've been addicted to sex, masturbation, pornography, adultery, and so many other sexually compulsive acts while attempting to maintain a control and image in my life. This disease has no end; its levels of destruction are limitless. Dr. Carnes in this book completely lays out how this addiction originates, how it operates, and how it consumates. This is the most thorough book I have read on sexual addiction yet it falls severely short in assisting the addict with overcoming this problem. As far as recovery, you'll have to purchase another."
1,Sex Addicts be warned!!,"Sex Addicts be warned!!This and a few others of Patrick Carnes books which are provided as support and steps for healing the sex addict include stories with explicit descriptions which can induce lust. Unfortunately I bought his `Facing the Shadow' workbook which had to include favorable descriptions of women sex addicts and acts they performed. I did a preview of this book and was shocked at the introduction quote to one of the chapters.I will not purchase another recovery book until I do extensive research so I know when I open the book I am in a safe place and can resume the healing process with an author that knows how it feels to be on the edge of acting out, struggling, and hoping to find a shoulder of support to lean on as I learn to conduct myself as a normal person.All the best to youJ"
3,Another 12 step program,My main disappointment in this book is that it's another 12-step program. I am not a firm believer in 12 step program. So this book has mainly been helpful in gaining insight to some of the faulty thinking that goes on in the minds of sex addicts. The author has obviously done his homework and does offer some valuable information for addicts and their loved ones. Also some helpful information for counselors who have never worked with this population before.
4,Attention suspense nuts and apologists alike...,"Where on earth was I a few months ago when this book and it's nonfiction companion, The Cross Examination of Jesus Christ, came out? If I had known then what I was missing, I likely would've tossed aside whatever was next in the review pile and cracked these babies open.I don't think I can write a better review than Eric Wilson did (1st review you come to), as I agree with most of what he said. These books amazed and thrilled me. Seriously--what a grand idea to market an entertaining novel and a convicting apologetics book together. Brilliant. They made me feel great, smart, and stupid all at the same time.I'm rambling now, so I'll stop. The novel by itself deserves just shy of 5 stars. The nonfiction deserves 5. Nuff said."
5,This is a Must Read on your list!,"This book was picked for our book club at the local Christian bookstore. It's not our usual genre, that being Historical Fiction, but we decided to mix it up a bit. And I am thrilled that we did! I couldn't put this book down. For the most part, the character development was awesome. The plot was so complex and exciting, and the end just about floored me! What more can you ask in a book? I will definitely read more from Randy Singer. All the reviewers have done a great job explaining the book to you. I just wanted to add to the chorus with my praise."
4,Good fun,"This is a fun read, with plots twists and hidden messages. It would be interesting to see this done as a movie."
3,solid American art rock,"Imagine Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder fronting Enchant and you've got House of Usher: passionate vocals atop sweeping, melodic keyboard-based arrangements with occasional muscular guitar. Interestingly for an art rock band (and much like their previously mentioned contemporaries Enchant), the lyrics tend to stress personal relationships and the emotional turmoil therein more than the usual prog staples (historical events, sci-fi, enlightenment allegories, etc.). Not bad."
2,Mediocre at best,"As huge prog rock fan I had heard of this band and searched extensively for this album after it was first released. I threw down top dollar for it. Dont make the same mistake. I was severely dissapointed in all aspects of the album. The muscianship, vocals and production are all inferior to much of whats being produced today. Someone elses review compared them to Enchant...thats being very kind. I doubt you can find this one in the cut-out bin (unless perhaps you live in Michigan) but thats the only way I would even consider buying their second release...if there is one."
2,A Promising Debut,"House of Usher's debut CD has some very nice moments. However, I didn't care for much of it. The first and last tracks are excellent and offer a lot of promise for this band. Stylistically, this CD is neo-progressive."
3,A Nice Little Romance,"The Admiral's Daughter has a clever although traditional plot, an intelligent heroine with bossy relatives, and a blackguard for a suitor. She ties herself in knots over the handsome hero and there is some frustrating tension as she works things out, with the help of the Royal Navy. A nice little romance."
1,Caution does not work with all cards!!!,"We received our Card Reader today. We have found that it WILL NOT recognize 16GB Transcend cards, 16GB adata cards, or a number of different Kingston cards. It does recognize all SanDisk Cards."
5,Great solution!,"I bought this to replace an external USB multi card reader. It's a great alternative and seems to be working well so far (I've only used it a few times). It fits flush with the side of the laptop (even when there is an SD card inside). The only drawback is the whole adapter has to be removed to remove the memory card, and it doesn't read all memory cards."
4,201 muffins by Gillespie and Yong,"Loved the book as a whole, great pictures, good format only real problem was the small printing. Would rather have had a larger book with bigger printing."
2,Ending Ruined It,"This book had potential but fell short by a mile. The characters and writing were good, but the tear jerking ending and stitched together plot spoiled the book. There was absolutely no reason why it should have ended like it did. If the author had made up her mind about the Ethan-might-be-Schizophrenic storyline and changed the finale completely, this novel may have been salvageable, but Anna Myers was obviously in a hurry to finish writing this."
3,Could have been better,"This book started out strong, and I'm not exactly sure what happened to it, but it limped along to the finish line.I didn't like the main character Clare at all. She was selfish and acted all holier-than-thou. But her worst offense was putting a boy before her so-called bestfriend, which is a no-no as everybody should know.I won't be reading any more books by Anna Myers."
4,the great but unclassifiable anthropologist,"A Professor of Social Science at Princeton for decades, Geertz gave a series of lectures at the University of Jerusalem and these were the result. The book serves as a memoir of his four decades in the field of anthropology and brings together two areas of the world where he has built his career. Noting the similarities and differences of working in Indonesia and Morocco, Geertz draws comparative aspects of these divergent cultures. Known for his 'thick description' which was made Bible in the ""interpretation of cultures"" (a must first-read for understanding his theories), Geertz uses it some, but doesn't overload the reader here. The uninformed reader can still enjoy the behind-the-scenes-look at one of the foremost anthropologists of the 20th century and not get lost along the way. For the Geertz fan, it is a must read, if nothing for his funny anecdotes."
1,Geertz ignored his presence during genocide for too long,"I have been influenced by the beauty of Geertz writing for decades, but After the Fact has left me disturbed and confused. This summer I read an essay by Stephen Reyna claiming Geertz covered-up genocide in Indonesia, I didn't believe Reyna's claims until I read Geertz's account of these events in this book. Now I don't know what to think, and I am beginning to question Geertz's methods and I want to know why Geertz was not outspoken about the genocide he saw."
5,Earl Mindell is the leading authority in this field,Earl Mindell provides all the information you will need to understand and overcome common allergies. This book is the best in its genre.
5,Hoya 72mm RM-72 IR Filter,The filter was delibered as promised ansd except foe a cracked protective case it was in fine shape. The filter performs very well and I am satisfied with the product and delivery. I wll soon have IR images posted to my web site: www.idaho-images.com
5,Madman Stan and other stories,"This is vintage Laymon. 20 short stories and not a dog in the bunch. All the Laymon trademarks are here: adventures in the woods, dumb teenagers, crazy killers and of course Madman Stan.Another quality book from Cemetery Dance."
4,For Fans of Enter Sandman. Cool B-Side.,"King Nothing is a cool Metallica song in the style of Enter Sandman. It has that big back-beat with a good vocal rhyme sceme. The guitar solo plays against the riff perfectly and is one of my favorite ""heavy"" solos from this band. On the downside, the song seems to be performed with too much restraint and it makes me want Metallica to just break free and ROCK like we know they can. This is typical of Metallica in the studio. (Where's the new LIVE album?) Actually, Side 2 IS a live recording--Ain't My Bitch. This one rocks. They perform it faster and more aggressively here than they did on the original studio version (found on Load). There is the occasional ""off"" note--especially in the vocals--but it is delivered in such a fun way that you just don't care. It makes you remember why you loved Metallica in the first place."
1,This Book is an Abomination of Alleged History and Raped my Mind,"The most horrendously fictitious book I have ever encounterd. This book rambles on with the most profound exacerbations and fabrications I have ever seen. At one point Ms. Andrews informs the readers that Atlanteans wore bright purple robes and tranported themselves through the air using their mind. Rubbish and hogwash. As a serious student of pre-columbian civilizations and ancient history I found this book to be a fantastical sojourn into the land of make believe. Do not waste your money, time, or neural impulses on this book if you are a serious academic, curious amateur, or anyone interested in the facts and evidence behind Atlantis. You will be sorely disappointed. If you seek an academic examination of the facts and evidence I suggest ""The Gateway to Atlantis"" by Andrew Collins available on Amazon, his books are excellent."
1,Pure crap,"I have read all the user reviews before buying the book, and I was expecting a scientific research on Atlantis. It turned out to be crap. It is quoting other Atlantis writers, with very doubtfull statements. Especially their sources are not scientific: they rely on pshycics and other new-age gurus. Her own research is not very convincing and is very suggestive. I hope there is somewhere another book about Atlantis that is more scientific..."
4,"fun read, great info, one concern","I had a lot of fun reading this book. She seems to be correct in her placement of Atlantis. She also had lot of theories on other spectacular phenomena and she is convincing.My only precaution is with her identifying aliens as unsung hereos of mankind who have occasionally helped us advance our technology over thousands of years. If they are from other star systems, why do aliens look so much like us? If you look at the depths of the oceans in our own planet, you see all kinds of life that is so extremely different from us. Yet alien abductees portray them as very human-like: 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 eyes, 1 nose, 1 head. This makes me wonder if aliens are Satan or his demons in disguise offering us the the apple again (high technology) in exchange for moving away from god. Anyway, whatever your views or concerns, this is a fun read."
1,May pass for fiction,"Very dissapointing. Description of book indicated a very serious look at Atlantis. But what I found was more of story based on fantasy. The descriptions of atlantean society architecture, and military were based (and then stretched) from descriptions from Cayce and telepathy with individuals who passed away 10,000 - 11,000 years ago. What little information that was based on historical records or modern research was weak (if not distorted)."
1,Clap-trap,"This should be ""Insights Into Logical Fallacies"". This book is written on assumptions, backed up with other fallacious authors, and based on a guy that made philosophy for a living.Do not buy this book unless you want to take it apart. The author isn't even an anthropologist, a geologist, or a student of culture. She's a Law professor.Someone should tell her that the Atlantic fault is divergent, that is, pulling away from each other. It's simple geology."
2,Predictable,"Stephanie, the most appealing of the Full House girls babysits her twin nephews. She takes them to school, and naturally the boys spit! Trust me, Stephanie finds them and smiles are abound in this family friendly story.Stephanie is the prettiest and brightest of the Full House girls. She's savvy, funny and has a good head on her shoulders. I like Jodie Sweetin, the actress who plays her."
3,ok book but not exactly worth buying,this was an ok book but it was kinda boring i didnt want to keep reading it but i did i would recommend not to read this book not worth the time
3,Deflated,"I've always loved Tony Williams from his Miles Davis Days. I loved his own early CDs' up until ""civilaization"". From that point on I felt the great drumming was still there but the music became so tasteful that it started to bore me. I feel that some of the fire inside Tony stared to die. Given the path of his musical development I'm surprised he's so traditional in his approach later in his career. What happened to the fire that pushed Miles? Where is the fire and daring of Lifetime? Where is the audacity of Trio of Doom? What happened to creating something new? When I want to hear Tony play with fire, I have to go to his Miles Davis days; that's when he REALLY pushed it. The playing of Tony Williams and compositions that Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock contributed are amazing. Everyone has differnt likes and dislikes, but for me Tony was his best between 1963, Miles In St. Louis and 1969 ""In a Silent Way"" recordings."
2,Disturbing Ending,"This book was very entertaining, at times a little slow, but kept me turing pages. Once Ironheart entered the picture i had hopes for a really great romance too.SPOILER HINT: There were some clues of love between Aurore and someone else but i took it to be family affection.Anyone the ending is why I gave this book a rating of 2 stars. The ending is a little confusing because i think the reader does not want to believe that happened. Even though that practice was used back in those times, it is utterly GROSS AND DISTURBING to fathom that today. I can see how maybe more mature concerning historical customs people would give this book a good rating. If you want to read a very different retelling of sleeping beauty i recommend Robin McKinley's Spindles End, which has an excellent romance and more imaginative take on sleeping beauty, it is alot more descriptive and alot longer though. The Storteller's Daughter by Cameron Dokey is an completely awesome book which i would give 5 stars."
5,a great tale,it was great she gave a good spin to the normal story sleeping beauty i like the way there are such interesting caracters and everybody seems very dinamic
2,"good book, bad ending","This story is a retelling of an old classic. It is new and exciting to read. It's not just the regular sleeping beauty story. I liked it a lot, until......THE ENDING!!!! I dont understand why it ended the way it did!!! It was distirbing to me. I don't think I'll read this book again."
2,Terrible,"Well this is a book that really isn't worth reading. It is a poor attempt to retell the story of Sleeping Beauty. It builds you up on one realtionship, then on another. It didn't have a prince in shining armor or an independant, spunky girl. Plus the ending didn't make any sense and was very disterbing. It really wasn't worth it.The reason I gave it two stars insead of 1 was because it was original. It retold the story of Sleeping Beauty so that you'll never think of it the same, and not in a good way. Please don't waste your time and read this terrible book."
3,the original was better,this book was good ans all it was just to forced if i may say so myself the princess is a little to bold for my liking and the story is slow in some places my advice to you: go rent it from the library:)
2,I didn't get it,I personally didn't like the book. The ending was a little too weird for my taste. My question: Does Aurore actually end up with Oswald? Or did I just skim this book over too fast. It could have been such a good book (I liked it until the end) but the ending? I didn't really like it.
2,"Sort of predictable, but has a likable heroine&#65533;","This book was not very memorable. It takes the story of Sleeping Beauty, now named Aurore, and how at the age of 16, instead of pricking her finger, strange happenings afflict the whole kingdom where she lives. She decides to leave and enter the nearby Forest, where no one dares set foot. It is here that she meets Prince Ironheart, who is on a quest as well. The two band together to try and break their curses. While I admit the fact Aurore is very likable, I think the other characters and predicable plot could have used some sprucing up."
4,"a very worthwhile read, with a nice ending","After reading this book, then reading the reader reviews, I'm compelled to give my own opinion. This was a lovely retelling of the story, Sleeping Beauty. In her narration, the author offers up some important life's lessons in a very novel way (no pun intended), not to be missed. I picked this book up to quickly scan its contents before purchasing it for my twelve year old daughter, then found myself unable to put it down. The beginning wordplay was somewhat challenging: It was an effort to read and reread the same sentences to discern the storyline. However, once the beginning was established the plot developed a comfortable rhythm. About that ending...it was not totally unexpected (don't read on if you wish to remain clueless as to how it ends) and there was nothing objectionable in the least bit given the marital customs of that period in time. The ending wasn't disappointing. Simply put, I would say that it was...Charming!"
3,"Good writing, good romance, then -- WHAT?!","Like some other readers, when I was reading this book, I thought it was pretty well written, with a pinch of romance, and some humor, so it seemed like a good book. But once I finished the end, I completely changed my opinion. I wish not to give away the ending, though, but - I - personally thought that it ended completely inappropriately. That was completely uncalled for, and should NOT have happened. If you have read this book and know what I mean, don't you agree?"
3,Great until the end,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was humerous, adventurous, romantic, and well-written. This was going to be one of my favorite books of all time. However, when i read the end, i completely changed my mind. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but I have no idea what the author was thinking. Anyway, i hope this review is helpful to those who would like to read it for the most enjoyable parts up until the last few pages."
5,Storytelling at it's best,"Fairy tale with a neat twist, really enjoy this author and her style, suitable for young readers as well as adults"
2,Terrible third season,"I loved the first two seasons but the third one is a big disappointment. The stories are boring and confused, the Cal character is obnoxious full time, there's no humor, no suspense. I would never have started watching this show if it had been like this third season. I'm not surprised it was canceled."
1,Major Damage,"This item is a total disappointment! I expected a fragile item such as a DVD to be packaged carefully, but no. Instead I hear my item rattling around in its package and them open it to see that the case is totally destroyed! I thought maybe a loose disc might occur, but not a giant hole in the back. It looks like somebody threw the item on the floor and then stepped on it! Quite frankly, I'm surprised the majority of the item is still intact."
5,Lie to Me dvd season 3,"The Lightman Group ""reads"" people by their facial expressions. Dr. Cal Lightman and Dr. Jillian Foster lead a team of experts in assisting people to find out the truth in various circumstances. While watching this you can learn a little about facial expressions, and realize the ones you make during different parts of you day. I found it very interesting between what they do and their private lives. You'll have to purchase your own copy because I don't plan to ever sell mine!"
5,Wonderful!,This is a wonderful mirror and I highly recommend this any parent! You can move it in all sorts of directions and you can see your little one perfectly with it because it is an actual mirror and not that awful reflective surface.
1,*** Beware! Defective item ***,"I bought the hardcorver edition of ""Principles of Deformity Correction"" by Dror Paley, and everything seemed to be fine. Therefore, now that I use the book on a daily basis I noticed that some pages from chapter VI are missing, all chapter VII is omitted and chapter VIII is included twice.I returned the book to Amazon 4 months ago... and the result has been even worse. I'm still waiting for a new one!!!Take care if you want to buy it from Amazon's. It's on sale, but they don't have the book."
1,Not Available Here,"I received an email stating that this book has not yet been released. This is not true, however, as it is available in my hospital library. I have not received this book yet and strongly advise others to order elsewhere."
1,poor item description - bought wrong book,"this item is NOT ""Principles of Deformity Correction"", it is the 'exercise book' that accompanies the main text.This is innacurately linked from the main search page, where you select ""hard/paperback' for the main book, this is displayed as the PAPERBACK, and the title does not explain that this is not the main book. paid $120 for an exercise book, when the main hardcover text is out of print (hence was a waste of money, book is useless)I hope they rectify this"
4,Good game,althought the graphics are a bit lame at times and the voices can make you want to kill your self the game over all is a great buy for the hardcore rpg player the cut scenes are nicely done and the story is very deep it starts off a bit slow but give it time and you wont be able to put it down.
2,Hated it...,"I played this game all the way through and honestly it was confusing disjointed and it did not seem like your actions on Earth (Midgard) had any affect on the fighters available in Asgard. Graphics were great, but really that is my only reason for not giving it 1 star."
3,It'll Keep You Busy,"All in all, it's not that fun of a game. There's no real story line to it, and a lot of the mechanics are so complex that it's not even worth it. The good news is that it goes on forever. If you enjoy aimlessly walking around in dungens beating up bad guys with no real goal, then this is the game for you. I've got almost 20 hours of game play on it and I'm only about half way through, but I've accomplished next to nothing, and I couldn't tell you the names of more than two characters (due to the lack of story). There is an overwhelming number of characters, which could be good or bad. If you like leveling up characters and collecting countless numbers of items and weapons, than buy this game. For most of you, I wouldn't buy it unless you have already played a Valkyrie Profile game and know for sure that you like that style of game because this is no ordinary RPG."
3,annoyed,this game seems very fun but i cant even figgure out how to get out of the first dungeon ive tryed multiple times and now its just anoying the first dungeon shouldnt be difficult well at least not so hard to where you cant get out anyway it seems like a good game but is hard really hard and the way its set up its hard to cheat by looking at a game guid too lol the graphics are pretty amazing during cut seans
3,I had been waiting to play this game but it was just ok,I had seen how rare and popular the original was and looked forward to playing it on the psp. This held my attention for a while but was by no means a great game. Rather just o.k.
5,Farm Innovators Heavy Duty Plastic Pedestal For Model HBC-120 Decorative Gray Stone Scalloped Birdbath; Model PED I,Nicely made and happy to find the base for the heated bird bath I had purchased from another company.
4,Worth the Upgrade,"I've been using an older version of DVD Copyware (2.0 I think) and had a few problems. Most issues were caused by the interaction of Copyware and the burn engine(Nero). My old version had a Nero istallation CD and a Copyware install CD. For some reason, both programs didn't always cooperate, but usually did the job.I saw the new version in the store yesterday and decided to upgrade. I'm glad I did. The new version is an all-in-one solution and so far is performing much better in regards to ease of use and reliability.The program is easy to use. I burned a few movies yesterday that gave me problems in the past and it worked great. I typically only make an exact back up copy of a DVD. Haven't tried any advanced features. Although I noticed that it splits to the 2nd DVD at a scene break when creating a copy of a two DVD set which was nice.System info: XP home on a Dell PII, 450Mhz, 256RAM."
1,Anything but Redxpress,"Terrible product, wasted my money on this and since it is software, can't get a refund. Does not recognize that I have a separate dvd reader and burner. I have yet to be able to copy a dvd. Redxpress' website does not respond, tried to register the product for support, and all I get is ""database busy"". Busy at 11am, busy at 6pm, busy at 2am! Do yourself a favor, try another copy product."
1,It just doesn't work.,Don't buy this software - it doesn't work and tech support doesn't care. Do yourself a favor and find other software.
1,Doesn't work,"This program doesn't work. Won't copy many DVD's. Customer support is a joke. They appear to care and give you a ""Ticket"" number for your problem. Good luck. I purchased this at CompUSA and will return it immediately. The box label for CopyWare 3 states that it will ""make a perfect backup copy of ANY DVD movie!"". I've yet to see it do that. I'm going to try DVD Cloner II next. Also, don't take the advise of anyone at CompUSA. My opinions..."
5,Great book for 11 and 12 year olds learning about faith in God,"My daughter is headed for middle school next year so she can definitely relate to Sophie and her concerns about this new ""frontier"". All the Sophie books are well written and keep us both wanting to read more. This book is no exception. Sophie is learning that being a true friendsometimes involves sacrificing things that are important to you.She is also learning that being a Christian means relying on God to guideyou through the ""storms"" of life. These are lessons that I want my daughter to learn. She's not so interested in devotional books anymore but LOVES stories so this is a great way for us to read and grow together."
3,Not what I ordered,"I wanted the mop refill pictured, but what I received was not like the photo. I specially ordered these refils because I wanted the ones with the heavy-duty tops (looks like leatherette or heavy blue vinyl). The mop heads wear at the top of the strands from being wrung out so much, and the heavy-duty top would keep the mop head from becoming frayed in that area. I was disappointed that what I received was just the regular mop heads with the same fiber strips all the way to the top. I could have bought those locally. I have since found the ones with the heavy-duty tops at Target, so I will be buying them there in the future."
3,Batteries not included,"The subject describes all. The device works fine but it's been years since I've purchased any electronic device that didn't include batteries, in this case they are hard to find button cell."
4,Great Product,"Worked as advertised. Very sturdy construction, quick easy intallation makes tunning my arrow rest a breeze. Price is a little high, but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Great guide to West Africa,This new edition of the Birds of Western Africa is a great companion on any trip to the region for anyone interested in the variety of birds you will encounter. I used it on a trip to Ghana in May 2008 and found it to be indispensable for identifying the more challenging and rare species as well as the common ones. The illustrations are really excellent and capture the more subtle plumage variations even in the greenbuls and bulbuls. Far and away the best plates in any African bird guide. Period. The text is concise and highlights important details including habitat and vocalizations so essential to recognizing birds in the field. Birds of Western Africa is convenient to carry with you on field trips and a great reference to have before and after planning your trip to Africa. Highly recommended.
3,An illustrated check list really rather than a field guide,"This guide is not as comprehensive as the Ridgely guide ""Birds of Ecuador-Field Guide"" but is only about 1/2 the size. The index is separated into two parts-English names and scientific names. The English index is in a large size font wich is easy to read. The scientific names are in a smaller italic font, which is not easy to read. I have no idea why they chose to do that. Some of the bird plates are unusually small for a fild guide--too small really, especially raptors. The bird descriptions are rather brief, just 3 or 4 lines at the most and there is no description of the birds' commonality. It is more of an illustrated check list than a field guide, very similar to the Princton illustrated checklist ""Birds of Sothern South America"" by La Peña and Rumboll. But unlike La Peña the distribution maps are on the pages following the illustrations instead of in the back of the book, a plus."
2,Started out great...,"Interesting design - uses a laptop-style power supply (internal) to ensure quality power, which makes sense to me. Also has an internal fan which started resonating within the first 15 days of owning.Product worked great for the occasional charging / discharging of my Nimh and NiCad packs, till day 154 (warranty runs out at day 120). I started discharging my IB4200 from full capacity (cycling) at 10a and blew the discharging capability of the Ionic to a smelly plume. Capacitors and ceramic resistors were OK - so I'm guessing it was one of the control chips on the board. Anyhoo - I'm pretty dissatisfied since my old Dynamite charger is still going after 5 years.The charging capability still works, but upgrade (discharging ability) from the first generation Ionic was a pretty low-quality add-on in my own opinion."
1,An OK intro 5.1 system.,"This system is OK for those who are on the cheap and want to upgrade to a 5.1 sound solution. However, there are much better alternatives out there, for a little bit more to pay. And as I'm about to expose, you get what you pay for.The main factor detracting from this product is weak bass. This comes as a result of the included 4"" LABTEC Subwoofer Driver. Yes, you heard correctly, a 4 inch driver. My brother purchased the system and wasnt happy with the bass at all, so we took the subwoofer assembly apart. Lo and behold, behind the Plastic and Cardboard that makes it appear to house a 8"" Driver, there is a wimpy 4"" cleverly disguised. The low-end manufacturer Labtec is clearly stamped on the driver. Feel free to pry yours open, if you don't believe me.I hope this isnt a sign of what is to come from audio products. They should advertise what the product truly is, and not try to cover it up with cardboard and plastic. Shame on you logitech for this cheap trick."
2,Great Speakers.....but watch out!,"I bought these speakers probably over 5 months ago. The sound was incredible for the price and everything was working smoothly. Unfortunetly, a week ago the speakers quit working. I took the piece apart and realized that the subwoofer was not recieving power from the power cord. I tried everything...from replacing the fuse to putting in new wires, Nothing Worked! I am not an expert electrician, but I know enough to fix and work on items that I own and I was completely blown away by the fact that something inside the internal power box fried. The speakers were plugged into an APC power unit so there is not a chance that the speakers could have recieved a power spike. I do not have an explanation, only that I will not be buying from Logitech anytime soon. Like I said, awesome speakers...but watch out and take care when considering purchasing these speakers."
5,great for xbox,"I used the adapter that came with the speakers to hookup my xbox and it sounds great. Remember to turn on Dolby 5.1 sound support in your xbox settings. What an improvement over my TV and projector speakers. The small speakers have limited power output, but still great for $40! Great for xbox lan parties. We connected xbox to an LCD projector and xbox audio to Z-640 speakers, and bingo, we were rocking in surround sound for only 40!"
5,Great set of speakers,"I saw these speakers on Amazon.com and for under forty bucks and I thought I might as well give them a shot for the price. After I got them set-up I realized that it was a steal! They look great and even more importantly sound great! I'm not really a gamer but I am a music buff who enjoys all different types of music and all types sounds great using these speakers! If your thinking about getting these I say jump on it, they are well worth it!"
4,"Incredible deal for the price, but...","The reason I say ""but"" is because it is an incredible deal because of the price, not the quality of the speakers. These are great entry-level 5.1 speakers, but if you want quality in 5.1 speakers you need to make the rather large jump from <50 dollars to over 200 for the Logitech Z-680s, which is what I am doing.Don't get me wrong, these are great speakers, even without the incredible deal you get. The sub is incredible, window-rattling when you get everything turned up. If you just want something with 5.1 surround sound (i.e. for gaming and movies), get these. If you really care about the quality (for music listening), get some 2.1s. It's sort of like moving all the quality from the other 3 speakers into the front right and left."
4,"For a budget set of 5.1 speakers, not half bad...","The speakers are relatively easy to set up, even without in depthg review of the instructions - just plug and play. The subwoofer's volume is a bit disappointing - I expected a bit more from it, but it's still pretty adequate. The highs from the satellite speakers are surprisingly rich, and no hum seems to exist even at relatively high volumes. The speakers are easy to adjust, with all pertinent controls being mounted on the center channel speaker. Overall, these are a nice value."
5,Exceeded expectations,"I read great reviews about these before I bought them, but still wasn't sure how great they'd be for ~$45. I must say that I am very impressed. I'm certainly not a speaker expert, but I'm very pleased with the speakers, and thrilled that the price is affordable."
2,Disappointed,"A few years ago I bought a used Creative Labs FPS 2000. Recently I accidentally knocked one of the connections lose, and thought I'd broken the speaker system. I plunged into researching speaker systems, and after reading a number of reviews I settled upon the Z640. When I got the speakers, I excitedly connected everything together and started perusing my playlist. Much to my dismay, none of the music seemed as clear or powerful as with my old system. I tried fiddling with my equalizer settings or using different Winamp plugins or using the Matrix mode for the speakers, but nothing made them sound better. I may not be a hardcore audiophile, but I can differentiate between broad levels of audio fidelity. These speakers simply aren't up to par. Thankfully, my FPS2000 system was still working, but I regret buying this set of speakers. If you want your speakers to give you a real musical experience, look elsewhere."
5,WTF LOL ROFL LMAO WOOT,"Ok..I am sure you heard the saying ""you get what you pay for."" Well not here you dont, you get much much more. These speakers sound amazing. I immediately fell in love with them the second I heard a song. The bass is excellent, it is crisp and clear with no distortion. You can turn these up and it will still sound great. For 42 bucks I feel like I am listening to a 150 dollar system. My friend down the block from me has a surround sound that he payed over 200 dollars for. I seriously can't tell the difference between mine and his. Of course I won't tell him this. So anyways, I recommend the Logitech Z-649 6 to anyone and everyone."
4,decent speaker system,"i have the logitech z-640s and there decent speakers. one thing to note on the sub though is that it dosent shake the ground at all but the sub do produce amazing deep sounds. but if shaking is what your desire then stay away from these speakers, but if your looking for decent deep sounds then these speakers are the way to go. also the sound if your someone that like stuff full blast and the neighbors compaining then maybe u need to get something a bit mroe expensive cause these speakers do get unclear if u have it a little too high. but for the price i dont think i can complain, good bang for the bucks!"
4,Great price and Great Speakers,Really good speakers for its price i bought them immeditaley when i saw the price and when i told my friends also the price they were shocked!!these r really good..i bought em to use with my laptop which has no sound card and i dont wanna invest in one as the sound card will be more expensive than the speakers so i have two choices i can get the sound from 3 speakers and the sub woofer or all i had to do was buy a separate wire which doesnt cost more than 2$and i manages to get sound out of all speakers without the sound card..and they sound amazing i am just imagining if i buy the sound card how the speakers would sound!!wow!!..i highly recommend these to any person with a tight budget
4,very nice,"good sound. music GREAT but its not bad either. you have to blast it to really get the good quality. so if youre not lookin for speakers you want to blast, then this may not be for you. but if youre lookin for bass and loudness, this is the best bang for the buck! oh and theres ALOTTAH bass."
3,Fair but still less than satifactory.,"I just installed the speakers, and I have to say I am less than satified. The sound quality is pretty good and the fact that it is 5.1 speakers, which attracted me most was somewhat disappointing. And the output of the sounds are surprisingly less than what I expected. Even though the center speaker and the subwoofer seem to have fair power, the satellite speakers are quite less than advertised output as I expected. My old Inpire 4400 (4.1) speakers have less advertised output than these, but these speakers had less than half of the volume my old one could go. I am still battling inside whether I should put the old speakers back or not...For the price I paid, I would say pretty good, but if one wants to have real loud cinema experience, these speakers would not give that satisfaction as one might expects."
2,Beware of the rear wireless speakers,Mine died. Logitech gave me the option to buy their wired speakers instead since the warranty expired. I wouldn't recommend buying these. Google the rear speaker not connecting issue with these speakers. You have been warned. I would recommend buying the wired equivalent.
1,"Not worth it, bad quality, unless you want cheap speakers!","I bought the set a while back and had to purchase a audio card to use the set properly. If the sub blows or starts rattling which mine did the set is toast. All the speakers run through the tiny 4inch cheap sub. So when it goes, don't expect to replace it. I talked to logitech to get a replacement, they basically laughed and said go buy some more speakers. So I now have five speakers that work but no way to listen to them. Great, nice paper weights."
5,GREAT FOR TV GAMES OR PC,Bought for the dvd payer to watch tv. Nice sound for the money. Not equal to room shattering equipment but perfect for people who want nice sound. Played 007 and it was awesome. Recommend++
3,Good for the price.,"I went to Circuit City yesterday to purchase some new speakers. I listened to these among others. In my opinion the quality is good for the price. They are just not that clear. The midrange sounds kind of muffled. The bass sounds good though. Spend a few dollars more and get some Creative labs Inspire speakers, they sound much better."
2,ehhhh........these arent that good,"For the price, very good. but be sure to get them for under 60 dollars, cuz theyre definitely not worth 80 dollars. These were OK.. i really love how logitech uses the metal stands, theyre so versatile! i can put them anywhere, i put one on my closet, clamping it on the top of the sliding door, and i hung them from my desk, and from my bed and from walls.however, these speakers werent very strong. And then strangely, they broke within 3 months of me having them. Very very very strange, the blue light wouldn't turn on and there would be no sound. I had to go back to my z340s, ...For the price, good. But i don't like these because you might as well just spend the extra....60 dollars? and buy the z560s. 330 more watts for 60 dollars more.Good for the price, i say.-wes-"
2,ok for the price...but,"i've owned many an item from logitech and have never had a problem, until now. i'm no speaker expert but i know i've definitely heard better quality sound. i'm one that likes to blast music for the whole world to hear. but with these speakers, once the sound gets too high you can't decipher the lyrics. needless to say i've had this system for less than a year and the subwoofer just blew out on me and i'm ticked. this time i'm going to spring for a more expensive system that has a reputable sound. all in all it was a good buy for a beginner like me, but i would have liked to be able to hear more from than less than a year's worth of music."
4,Good 5.1 Speakers for the price,"Logitech has a way with being able to bring the price down on its products.First off I'd like to say this is a great bargain. The Highs are high but sound... i don't know... soft and separated? The lows are low (good sub) and the midranges lack bigtime. I'm guessing its good for its purpose but you miss a lot witht he lack of midrange. Sound gets distored at higher levels of music.Then again you ask for something perfect at this price. Very good deal for people who don't want to break the budget, but don't expect something that'll blow you away."
4,Good sound for the price,"I've set up these speakers a few days ago, and I'm pleased with the sound.. Especially for this price tag. Right now I only use the on-board soundcard on my Dell, which gives out a stereo sound only, but the Matrix feature and the adapter for the gaming consoles (a 'workaround' to make all 6 speakers work), i get pretty good quality. I won't know about the real surround sound until my new Audigy 2 arrives (haven't ordered it yet), but overall sound quality is very good. Speakers don't clip, and the bass is stronger than I expected!I give this 4 stars instead of 5 only because it's not THX certified, but then again with this price I guess it couldn't be!"
3,Chicken Hunter Wanted JC,"Fun, but tedious as the time period is very short, and you flip back to menus frequently. Could use some user preference input features."
5,Amazing!!!!,"This book was beautiful! American history was recorded so well by the author it made you feel his hunger! I gave this book to my grandfather, who is a WWII vet, and I plan on having my children read it. Amazing!"
2,"An aging starter book, but little more...","First, this book is a bit out of date... 10 years old now. The author talks of many ""current"" technologies, but explanations and comparisons of the products are limited at best. There is a lot of emphasis on converting carburated engines to fuel injection, but only specific examples are given when it comes right down to it, leaving many people and possibilities out in the cold.For those wishing to derive their own fuel-injection systems, this may be a good starter book, but leaves the reader with more questions than answers. It looks at converting a large cross-section of cars and trucks in the case-studies section, but only gives a general overview of the processes, with no real technical data to back them up or explorations of other options, which would be very helpful."
4,U R There,"An enjoyable, high energy, and imaginative account of Galileo's efforts to acquaint society in the 1600s with his scientific discoveries. Director Losey can be commended on the overall result. Produced in 1975, it has held up quite well.I had not previously seen Topol in any role other than his famous one in ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and here he does a credible job, if a bit over-blown. The rest of the big-name cast takes their cue from his energy level, consequently you won't be bored."
2,a little TOO light on the action.,Due has a serious gun and some killer skills but most of the movie didnt show any of that. it was a bumch ofother stuff that just didnt make much sense to me. he is a bounty hunter but after watching 100s of minutes he catches like 3 or 4 people. whats up with that? the anime is crisp. the voices are clear. the chicks are hot(as always)I was hoping for Cowboy Bebop with more guns. The animation was there but... oh-well.
2,"Hey plot developement....Wait no, just more crying","Meet Roy, he used to be an officer who played by the rules but, turned bounty hunter when losing his daughter to a mysterious event known as the blast fall. When out on a job gone wrong, a strange girl intervenes to save Roy, her name is Solty.From this point on, the plot takes a major detour which will undeniably leave you wondering, what just happened and why does it seem like every episode, someone different is crying about absolutely nothing. Now don't get me wrong, I can appreciate dramatic series with heavy moments emphasized by crying characters. But, even this was a bit much. Then the icing on the cake, the fittingly climactic moment followed by one of those ridiculous, many years later sub titles, where all we see is only two characters from a larger cast sharing a completely useless moment. Where do you think blank is? says 1. I'm sure blank is out there somewhere and everything is fine, says 2. Sadly it's not, The End."
5,Circulon 10 piece Cookware Set,Absolutely unbelievable! Nothing sticks to it and so easy to clean up. Love it-
5,great cookware,this is the best cookware I have ever owned. Nothing sticks to it and it is easy to clean. It cooks with even heat so all your meals are cooked correctly.
1,Don't waste your money,"The non-stick coating isn't very ""non-stick""...difficult to clean out all the little grooves, and the coating started to flake off after a few months. The pans are not oven safe so they are very limited (no moving something into a hot...over 350 degrees...oven to finish cooking after browning). You also can't use high heat on the stove top for fear of damaging the non-stick surface. I finally replaced the whole set with the Kitchen Aid Gourmet Distinctions and wish I had done so YEARS ago."
1,Will not work!,I have a Dell Insperon Notebook and can not detect the PCMCIA card much less the compact flash in it.This could be an error on my end but after several hours of trouble shooting I can not help but think that this card just doesn't work.I would not recommend this product.
5,Kevin Russell - Guitarist Extrodinare,"Each and every record/CD that Kevin Russell plays on or produces is a must have for everyone's collection. After becoming aware of his hard driving rock/blues sound, I have tracked down and purchased any project he was involved in from four 707 record/CD's, three San Francisco Blues Guitar Summit #'s 1-3, two L.A. Blues Authority records/CD's, his solo work and his work with his brother, The Russell Brothers Band. I also have him on The Better Blues Authority w/ Rick Derringer. If I could get my hands on a copy of the Russell-(Neal)Schon Band production I'd be fairly well set up. The music is the best, if you like the best sounding music. Thank God for the internet to be able to find this great artist's works! Buy this one and anything else of his that you can get your paws on..."
3,"Lleno de detalles, pero es un poco seco","Usamos este libro para nuestra clase de la historia de Latinoamerica y yo crei que era un poco seco. Esta llena de detalles pero a veces es dificil a leer. Si Ud. necesita un libro para detalles como un ensayo, este es un buen libro. Pero este libro es aburrido."
1,I dont know how to fix.,I called to the given number ... but they dint respond me properly. So i want to return my cycle. can u help me in this.
1,Undecided,"I was a little disappointed when I received this video. I tried it in 3 different dvd players and all of them said it was an unreadable disk with errors. I simply returned the video and didn't ask for a replacement since I also had purchased other potty training videos. I was excited about this one since it was geared toward girls, but I was completely shocked about it's outcome. The disk appeared to be new and didn't have any scratches on it, but it was packaged in a disk cover like you get with music CD's. I know that shouldn't matter on quality, but the first thing I though even before I knew it didn't play was it was going to be cheap... maybe that was the problem. I would love to hear from anyone who has this product... if it's worth it I might try to reorder in hopes it's a good disk."
5,To Become a Human Being,"This simple, poetic book is a gem. It is a reminder of things much more important in life than just making money and amassing material wealth. If only there existed an elder like Leon Shenandoah in every family and teacher like him in every school."
2,Culture or Christianity,"Whereas there is the standard obligatory formulaic mystery/mystic old-speak of the aboriginal narrative, I fould the religious reference and allegories to Christianity offensive and counter cultural. The religious colonialism of the last hundred years has imprinted itself on the authenticity of an animist world view. As an aboriginal, I suggest Dee Brown's or Vine Deloria's works, not because they sell the spiritualy of the ancients but speak of the culture-destroying effect of religious cant on a completely heterogenious world view. It certainly has it folkloric value. It was Dr.Dorothy Lee who said of native religion: ""if its accessible it cannot be authentic; if its authentic it is not accessible""....and she spent her life in this study"
5,amazing book,"A book full of Native American wisdom, useful philosophies for everyday life. I've reread it again and again.It makes you think!"
4,Parlez Vous?,This is a band from Boston. That is news. They have played with bands like Add N to X and Momus. They also played on the Electroclash 2 tour. Freezepop's music is on video games already. This is their second record. They seem to have had a diet of electro and Japanese music. This band is cool. They have a vibe that is closer to Berlin and Missing Persons than anyone. Finally someone has got it right. They have a very similar esthetic to The Epoxies. Moving backwards is also moving forward.
5,simply amazing,"this is the first real freezepop cd i have owned and it is worth every pennyif you love synth-pop, get thisif you dont love synth pop, you suck"
2,The same as his other books,"If you have read one book of Buzan, you know about all there seems to be coming from him. This book is mainly about the major system (described only shortly).About half the book consists of historical data (writers, composers, painters, etc.), ready to be learned. That is why I bought the book. The bad thing, though, is that he does not really explain how to learn them. Basically he just sais ""here you are, learn it"".This holds especially true for Shakespeare. His advice of reading a summary first does not help me to ""memorize"" his books :-(Finally there is (again) a list of the most important 100 words of several languages with pronounciation. I am German and the Germen pronounciation has a very strong american accent to it. Not completely wrong, but not correct either, so be careful about that."
4,Good overall needs a bit more info,This book is very good using the techniques i was able to memorize stuff i would have never thought I could in a million years! I was able to recite the lists of stuff inside to memorize like a tape recorder. It could use a bit more info and more tutoring on the subtleties. A chunk of the book is taken up by lists but that was alright for me because it gave a great way to test the techniques and it was useful information to learn.
4,Good Car Music,"This makes good car music.We used it a lot for a while but now Ive lost interest in it and have moved on to something else. It's upbeat and happy music, im sure I'll get it out again at some point.Not a good idea to do the signs whilst driving... unless at traffic lights :)"
5,You will get pulled into the emotions with a passion.,"This was my first Audrey Howard book. I don't know how I missed this author but I am going back for more. Sally Grimshaw is unlike any heroine I have met and one so real she leaps off the pages. This does not mean that I always liked what she was doing and agreed with how she faced situations. When faced with her biggest tragedy, I found myself angry at Sally but at no time could I abandon her. Audrey Howard has created characters of tremedous depth."
5,Cool story and great stocking stuffer,I bought this for my boyfriend for a Christmas present because this is his all time favorite story but he didn't have a copy. Even though I bought it used it is still in good condition and made him very happy.
4,I thought it was great!,I really enjoyed this book. It's very well-written and a fun read. I found this review very helpful: [...]
3,Not for all Tastes,"I had been told to read Necroscope for my years and I have always put it off. Well I just finished the nevel and I have to say I wasn't the most thrilled about it. I thought it was more in the Vampire type setting but in actually it was a cold war type thiller with the supernatural thrown in.Here we are dealing with two Necromancers, one Goood the other Evil. In the end the forces will clash and that was a good ending. However the novel seemed a bit disjointed, the chapter were very long dealing with one character, then the next chapter would be another 40 pages, it got to be tedious to me. I will say the premis was very good, I just didn't care for the execution. I know you will all hate me, but I am just being honest."
1,I would have put 0 stars but that's not an option.,"I have read good books, and this is NOT one of them. Granted the people who have reviewed this book before thought it was great, but give me Ann Rice, Nancy A. Collins (Sunglasses after Dark), Dean Koontz, or Beth Scott & Michael Norman (Haunted Heartland) any day. The book was sooooooo boring it was such a stuggle to read it, I normally take 1 or 2 days to read a book, this was a forcing week and a half."
5,This book is great!,"I feel this book is great. I love the interesting ideas that this author has created. I have never heard of a necroscope or a necromancer. I am not sure if he created these creatures himself, but I find them intriguing! Non-stop interaction between characters."
1,DO NOT BUY THE eBook VERSION!!!,"I am a Lumley fan from way back and first purchased Necroscope upon its original release in the US.The eBook version has the WORST editing I have ever encountered. Oh, I could let go the obvious OCR issues between Ilse and Use, but the REAL problems are in idiocy with the structure of the novel. How any FOOL could put the prologue at the end of the novel right before the Epilogue is beyond me.I am VERY DISPLEASED with this version and urge all to forego purchasing ANY eBook of the Necroscope series until they correct the problems (and update the versions of those who already purchased this steaming pile of garbage).If I could give zero stars, I would."
5,Pure Genius... A tragic heroic lifetime saga.,"This isn't so much a review of this book as a strong recommendation for the entire series, being the Necroscope series, The Lost Years, and the Vampire World series. It is obvious by reading the series that a lot of thought has gone into the series. The links between the books aren't disjointed at all and for all intents and purposes it may as well be one book (albeit a very large one that would hurt a great deal if you dropped it on your foot). It is without doubt, the best series that I have ever read. I literally couldn't put any of them down. The best thing was they kept my sane during a couple of flights to Australia. You can't help but feel pity for Harry Keogh as he goes from one loss in his life to the next. Strongly recommended."
2,"Puerile, Gory, Very Few Redeeming Virtues","The author started out with a great premise, but it quickly deteriorated into gag-inducing purple prose. Apparently I'm in the minority, since he went on to write many sequels, but I'll be stopping at this one."
1,ZZZ,"This book seems popular, but clearly it isn't for everyone. I didn't get very far before putting it down for good. I can't really give a full review, but I will say this book moved very, very slowly. It gets discouraging when there's 500 pages with many words per page and it all over description of details. I'm not to big on all the foreign politics and foreign names that I can't even pronounce properly. I'm glad this book was free with Amazon's 4 for 3 book sale."
5,WOW,"I have read almsot this entire series, and thank god that I found this book based on the cover art. The story revolves around a young man, Harry, that has the ability to speak to the dead. Over the course of the other book she battles vampires to protect earth alongside the ESPianoge branch of the British secret service and the dead actually rise up to protect Harry. So much happens that I can't even get in to it right now, but you owe it to yourself to pick up this book. Once you do I promise you will be hooked on the Necroscope series as I was."
5,The Greates Book Ever,"This book is the all time best. Along with its sequals this is definately Lumley's best work. These books, exspecially Necroscope, long surpasses any other Vampire books in exsistance. Once you pick this one up, you better just order the whole set"
2,Not exactly what I expected...,"...and that's not a good thing. I was under the impression this was going to be a VAMPIRE novel. Yeah, not so much. I don't want to spoil any plot points, but suffice to say that if you are in the market for a novel full of nosferatu mayhem, you won't find it here.Besides the utter lack of vamps, another problem I had with this book was the dialog. Absolutely, positively, ATROCIOUS.I realize there are many fans of this series out there, but as for myself, I don't see the appeal. It took every ounce of willpower that I could muster to finish this novel. I have to say that this has been one of the most disappointing reads I've ever had."
1,"""Stiff, Plodding Story""","The premise of the supernatural with a Cold War twist really intrigued me. Unfortunately, Mr. Lumley did not execute to my liking. I found the little bit of the book I read plodding, over descriptive and filled with stiff characters and dialogue."
1,Pretty lame.,"If you are over 16 years old or somewhat intelligent, this book is not for you. I gained nothing from reading this ""book"". Was this a children's book? If so, change my rating to 2 stars."
4,Not what you expect...,"What an odd book this is. I grew to like Brian Lumley from his short stories I found in anthologies. They usually focus on small, crawling horrors. Therefore, I decided to give his popular Necroscope series a go.From the creepy cover-art (a decayed but still-living vampire skull), I thought this would be a book about vampires. And it is...and psychics, and espionage, and science fiction, and warfare, and mathematics. Lumley throws everything but the kitchen sink in here. It is held together because Lumley is really good at his craft - he knows how to create characters and scenes and he has one of the best prose styles in horror literature. My main criticism is that he jumps a little too far off the diving board, but that is a matter of taste. Anyone expecting Anne Rice will be disappointed - this is one wild ride."
5,The Necroscope,"This is one of the best horror books that I've ever read. When I was reading the book it would make me hear things a night when I would go to bed. It would even give me goose bumps while I was reading it. This is the first book I found that was able to do that to me. The main character in the story Harry Keogh is a man that can talk to the dead. While he talks to the dead, he finds out that there is a horrible plague is on the earth, they were telling him about the wampier's that were feeding off the human race. Also in the story there's a man named Boris Dragosani that could talk to the dead also but he uses that power to take the secrets away from the dead. In this book it is a fight to the death with the dead included in the fight."
1,Misleading,i bought this dvd thinking i would get to see something of the killers backgrounds but instead i got a boring viewpoint coming from the victims parents. i thought perhaps the court scene might do some justice but i got zilch. don't waste your money on this crap.
1,Product non-functional at purchase,"This product is packaged with appealing features and capabilities, however, is not functional. The USB cable is not included and renders the printer initially useless. After purchasing a USB cable, additional hardware is necessary to connect the printer to the CPU. Why bother to sell a product at a false cost for performance? All needed hardware should be included in the cost or remove this printer from the market. Items not included are obscurely printed on the box contents."
1,print type,"I am using this as a stand alone, no computer connection.I have tried to get this to print black ink all the time. I have written the help center 8 times. They don't know how to do it. I don't want red ink only on every page I copy."
1,Avoid,"I agree with what others say about this unit: avoid it. In fact, I bought a Canon replacement and will install it when the ink cartridges on the Lexmark go empty. Why? The printer does occasionally jam (paper feeding is sloppy, jerky), the driver/software does crash once in awhile and does not gracefully exit Windows XP when I shut down my computer, the ink cartridges are extraordinarily expensive, and the print quality is--at best--mediocre.I didn't pay much for this thing, so I'm willing to eat my losses instead of buying more cartridges."
3,"Good printer, bad fax","I have this printer for over 1 year now.The printer, other than a paper jam once a while, it works fine.The big problem is the paper feed of the fax. If you put more than 1 page, most of the times it will pull 2-3 pages together. I called technical support and was advised to feed it one page at a time, wait till it pulls the page in and then feed in the next page. The guy said it was not designed to fax more than one page at a time.It also require you to feed all the pages before it dials the number, just to find out after feeding it 10 pages one at a time that the number you called is busy.Bottom line - if you need to fax more than one page at a time, do not buy this printer."
1,Not worth the money,Printer soaked up ink like a sponge!! Ink cartridge became blocked even when stored with the original tape over the printhead. Lexmark technical support suggested using a damp lint free cloth to clear the printhead. This did not work most of the time. I was not too happy having to sponge bath the ink cartridge everytime I needed to print. After much complaining Lexmark sent out a replacement cartridge which eventually clogged after printing about 20 sheets of paper. Recommend buying some other brand of printer. Lexmark ink cartridges are expensive. The cost of these and the frequent problems makes this printer not worth buying. I went back to using HP printers. I have an 8 year old HP Laserjet 4ML that works like brand new after print over 4000 pages. I have an HP Photosmart 7550 for photo and color printing. I am very happy with both printers.
2,Wheels are weak,Cart is very solid but the wheels are not able to hold 500lbs on anything but flat ground. Hauled my deer out this year and the second log I had to cross the wheels just folded up on it. They need to put some heavier duty wheels on this thing for it to be nice.
5,Golf is fun,"The very talented Billy Mac's ""Tee It Up"" CD is mostly just a lot of fun, but for the true golf aficionado ""Augusta Sweet Augusta"" will give goose bumps."
5,"Great songs, lyrics and vocals - Billy has a golfer's soul","Clever lyrics and a great musical style. Reggae, R&B, and New Orleans style piano - all with a golfer's perspecetive. I am going to give this as a gift to all of my golfing friends."
2,"Corny, cute, cliche, but clever, faddish, but interesting...","I've heard 'em all now. Golf songs. Not too bad, catchy tunes.I'm hooked on the famous golfing-trio's ""Jake Trout and The Flounders"" and with the untimely passing of the classy ""Flounder"" Payne Steward, I'd recommend it highly. Tee It Up has its musical moments but lacks in sincerity. It's corny, but I guess so is golf. Why doesn't someone do some BOWLING msuic!"
3,Nice tool bit,This is a very nice tool bit. It is hard to set up but once set you need to keep it in your power tool. It would be nice if I had two routers when I used this bit. Otherwise the bit is excellent.
5,wow,"this was really interesting. yet sad, and yet often funny SOMETIMES. if you like the Runaways, watch this."
3,Where's Joan ?,"I was so excited to see the DVD. I've been a fan of Joan Jett & the Runaways for as long as I can remember. The documentary was interesting enough, but I couldn't stop wishing that Joan Jett was in it. Why wasn't she in it & so on. This became very distracting. It was cool to hear the points of view from the other ladies & see where they all wound up."
3,"A ""Runaway"" documentary","it was a little too long for me to sit and enjoy the whole thing at once, plus it got a little bitchy. Very detailed though and probably true."
2,Only For Real Diehard Runaways Fans,"What you get is and hour and 45 minutes of endless, repetitive talk. By the time it was half over I was ready to scream ""OK, I get it! Your manager was an a-hole, you did a lot of drugs and didn't all get along. Like how many other bands?"" What you don't get is music from the Runaways. Also a lot of really bad camera work. Maybe it was supposed to be artsy. I don't know, but I found it distracting.All that being said, the interviews did provide some interesting insights into the band as far as their personalities and inter-personal relationships go. I just wish they could have at least talked about their music, even if we couldn't hear any of it.I agree with another reviewer that it is perhaps one half of a good documentary. If they could edit the interviews down to an hour and add an hour of concert footage."
4,Wonderful... Though Something Significant is Missing.,"The significant is Joan Jett. All the Runaways participate and Fowley even rears his arrogance for all to see but Jett is nowhere to be found outside of the historical footage. This is still a great behind-the-scenes retrospective through interviews (the girls still look great today) and quick flashback glimpses through concert and touring footage. It could have been spiced up with more Runaways material from the era; the footage of the Velvet's ""Rock and Roll"" live is a highlight. I grew right along with them and though I was a male in the audience, felt their ups and downs. I also took offense at Mr. Fowleys assessment of The Runaways' male audience at the time... he missed me by a mile. Ms. Blue is to be commended for her efforts."
4,Cool look back at The Runaways,"I really loved this documentary, even without Joan Jett playing a significant role in it. It was really cool to hear the women talking about their time as members of The Runaways and getting a behind the scenes look at what they went through. Good to see Sandy West too in better times..RIP Sandy. Loved the interview with Cherie and Jackie and I would say if you are or were a Runaways fan..buy it."
5,A story of Excellence!,"This book is an artful expression of the life of excellence. Ms. Gilbert gives the reader insight into the mind/life of a genius or rare talent of the world's greats. The story is uniquely woven like a fine symphony taking the reader through difficult decisions as the protagonist struggles with what is truly best for herself combined with a possibly sacrificial love for another. Though I know virutally nothing about the piano, I was very caught up in the descriptions of the music and the competitions and the whole sense of soul searching and the idea of living your best life. I loved the analogy of the Russian folk tale as well. Great book."
5,The B-sides are worth it!,"The remixes of ""The 13th"" I could really care less about, but the song ""It used to be me"" is one of the best, if not the best, Cure song on the market. This is a ""must have"" for any real Cure fan. Breathtaking........"
2,Cute but not sturdy,"This product seems like a great idea in theory, but it really doesn't work in real life. The chair is not balanced and it is almost impossible to sit in without having both of your feet firmly planted and you actively balancing yourself. You definitely can't relax in it. We tried even letting a lot of the air out so that it wasn't rolling around so much, and that didn't really work either. Also, once you are out of the chair, you better hope it's not a windy day. There really needs to be some kind of device on it to keep it on the ground and in one place. I did give it 2 stars because the plastic is very durable."
3,good,"This bag is great. However, ""Protective padded sleeve holds laptop up to 15.4"" is not tall enough for my 15.4"" Dell Insp laptop.It is wide enough to hold it and the zipper can't be close with the laptop inside. I am using it anyway to carry the laptop."
2,"works, but quality could be better","Purchased this backpack after seeing it at a local retailer. Tags and description state it will fit a 15.6"" laptop. Maybe some will fit but not a Dell with the full numeric keypad, making it stick out of the top of the sleeve 1.5"". After using it for two weeks the zipper pulls started to come off leaving no way to securly close the backpack. Be careful with this purchase, it is not the quality backpack for the money. Now we have to return this one and find another."
1,Why buy a Chinese printed photocopy?,"Like several other Bible publishers, Hendrickson is using Amity Press in China to print Bibles to peddle to the masses.This is not a particularly well-constructed Bible, nor are the photocopied pages nice to look at. If you'd like to commemorate the Authorized Version, or give it a try...or switch altogether, I recommend going to the Trinitarian Bible Society, USA (if you're in the U.S.) and buy a quality, calfskin, smith sewn, Bible printed in the Netherlands on Bible-quality paper. It will cost you a whopping $32 for the Windsor edition. If you'd like to spend less, they have non-leather versions for about $10.00...again, all are of a much higher quality than this bastardized printing created for the sole reason of capitalizing on the KJV's 400th Anniversary."
4,Not changed.,"This Bible is great from a couple of points. First is historical. One can see how the first printing looked. Second, is practical. Here a person can answer the skeptic with regards to changes in the KJV. There aren't any. Changing font types and cleaning up typos do not count as a revision. Removing the apocrapha doesn't either since the KJV translators did not consider it to be inspired text. The KJV of today says the same thing the KJV of 1611 said--only without the typos and with spelling standardized. This version proves that."
5,Most Popular Book in History,"This 1611 King James Bible is the most widely read book in world history in the English language. It is similar to the Authorized King James Bible, but this is a little more expensuve- I got mine for $35. The bible is a collection of many differant books making up the gospel of our lord Jesus Christ. The Jewish Torah is the first five books of the bible. Genesis explains the beginning of the world- the creation theory is that God created the world from nothing at the beginning of time in 7 days. The four gospels are Matthew, Mark, Luke & John. John the Baptist was the original Baptist and Baptized Jesus. Revelation is the end of the world- the 7 headed monster was not Satan, the Devil, The Antichrist, a Demigod or Tiamat- it was simply a seven headed dragon, you as a soldier for Christ must slay it. Getting baptized and confirmed is all it takes to enter the Priesthood. This is the highest rate bible there is, in Elizabethan English at a 12th grade reading level."
1,Stay away,Very poorly designed fan. It vibrates so much that the entire case starts resonating and the noise is unbearable. I've tried it in 2 different computers with different cases with the same result.Stay away. Stay very away.
4,Great filter,"Still getting used to it, but a great filter for bright day landscapes. Its a little thick and Im getting vignetting at 28-40mm around the corners of my 28-300 lens. Ive found that you need to alter the white balance from Auto to Daylight in order to create the desired effect, but if shooting RAW this is irrelevant."
2,Save your money!,"This software does not give you anything new. The ""Official Guide for the GMAT"" by ETS already has the same practice problems.I found the software in ""Cracking the GMAT CAT"" by the Princeton Review to me much more helpful."
2,Not worth the money; test questions are way too easy.,"The questions on the disks, supposed to be 'real' exam question do not at all reflect the level of the actual test. You are left with a false feeling of confidence. Also, the tutorials are marginal at best... Only the clear explanations of the correct answers make this a two star review."
1,Not for NT,"I have installed this on NT, but cannot get the tests or any sample questions to appear. I get a ""limited system resource"" error, but this is bogus with my setup."
3,Excellent Preparation...when the software works,"I found this type of preparation to be key in getting ready for the GMAT. Unfortunately, the second sample GMAT CAT kept ""blowing up"" on me every time I used it. I finally gave up. However, I still recommend it, since it is the closest to the real thing."
2,Exact same questions as '96 8th edition paperback.,"I am very disappointed that a lot of the practice sections are exactly the same as in an earlier version of the paperback. I bought the 1996 8th edition of the book a couple of years ago, and thought that this would be a good follow-up. You would think that they could have come up different passages in the reading comprehension section."
3,Often inflates your score!,"Hey, don't waste your money!!You can now get the new version, v3.0 for FREE!Just go to the official GMAT site to download it!The big problem with this software is that most of my students get a higher score on this than on the real test, so remember that when you're preparing.Good luck on your test!"
2,power prep software is easier than the real test,"I felt that the power prep software was easier than the real test and thus gave me a false sence of security. I scored 700 and 750 in the 2 tests, however scored only 620 on the real test and felt that the questions were harder."
4,Get this is you don't want to pay for Orff,"I am not a professional musician by any means but like anybody else, I can tell when something sounds good. This instrument may not be an Orff, but I think it is wonderful. The Orff instruments are twice as much and I can't imagine they sound much better. My daughter has an Orff at school and she doesn't seem to notice any difference."
4,GO LORD ZEDD'S MONSTER HEADS,"WHEN LORD ZEDD PEEKSINON THE ANGEL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLAWEEN PARTY, HE DECIDES TO THROW HIS OWN BASH, AFTER ALL. WHOCOULD HOSTA BETTERPARTY THAN THE SUPREME MONSTERMAKER HIMSELF. JOIN LORD ZEDD GOLDAR AND THEIR BUMBLING HENCHMEN AS THEY REMINISCE ABOUT SOME OF THE GREATEST MONSTERS EVER TO BATTLE THE POWER RANGERS. THIS SPECIAL EPISODE FEATURES INCREDIBLE FIGHTING SCENES WITH THE MEANEST AND UGLIEST MONSTERS INCLUDING EYE GUY, SILVER HORNS, THE PUMPKIN RAPPER, SNIZZARD LIPS, THE TERROR TOAD AND MANY MANY MORE."
2,Meh. Just meh.,"You can find most of these DVDs in one fell swoop on e-bay already if you use the search term ""DVD lot"" and you will end up paying about half the total cost. These are all Warner Bros snapcase DVDs, by the way. Yep, they come in those cases that drive everyone insane because they are cheap beyond a reasonable doubt. It wouldn't surprise me if half these titles are updated by Warner with new 2-disc special editions (in awesome packaging) in the next 2 years or so. Shop around, folks. These are the same movies you see countless times at your local pawn shop for half the cost here. There's nothing special here to be had, and chances are, you'll be paying for at least one title you don't want."
2,Extremely Expensive.,"Most dvds now you can buy real cheap. Comedy dvds I can buy at hollywood video for about 10 bucks. The dvd says you save alot, but there is a problem, you probably have half these movies. Austin Powers, everyone has it.Seriously though, lets break it down. I have seen basically all these movies. I own most of them. The only person who would spend 300 bucks on this pack is a true comedy fan. If you are a true comedy fan, then you probably have over half these movies. Noone decides one day, ""I think I am going to guy buy 30 comedy dvd's for 300 dollars even though I dislike comedies."" On the other hand, ""I think I am going to buy 30 comedy dvds, I own most of them, but hey, 2 dvds are better then one."" Wrong, the pack proves to be rather useless for anyone.The dvd's are somewhat funny. Most of them have lost their funniness though, so I woulnd't reccomend this to anyone."
1,You have to be kidding,"This ""deal"" is insulting!!! $478 for 30 movies, how is this a good deal? At almost $16 per movie (not even great movies), you're delusional. Whoever thought up this bright idea needs to be drug tested."
2,not a good deal,Why would any one pay $300 for this collection? When you can get most of these titles for under $7.50 each and under $5 at wal-mart of all places. And if you really look at it do u really want all 30 titles? Every one is sure not to like a few out of this bundle.
4,Good collection to give to the new DVD Owner,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that most people would not benefit from this selection of DVD's UNLESS, however, they're brand-new DVD owners who want an instant collection. The movie selection is pretty good, and $10 per DVD is pretty decent, though I, myself, probably have about half of the DVD's already and wouldn't necessarily want the other half. As cheap as most DVDs are now, though, unless you are just clueless as to what movies to select for someone else, I would think you could do a better job of selecting DVDs that you know you (or the gift recepient) would enjoy."
1,Book should have been titled Jesus Smith,"The mormon belief is strong, there is no doubt. Unfortunately, their belief is misguided in Jesus Smith, Joseph's alter ego."
1,A deceptive book,"This book does present mostly what Mormons believe. However, it does not clearly present or emphasize the distinctive and gross differences between our real God and Creator, and Jesus Christ as revealed by the Bible and the distorted Mormon view. It is the Bible, not the BOM, D&C, or POGP that truthfully and accurately reveals to us who is God our Creator. This book is clearly misleading and having Mouw write the forward shows its true intend, which is to compromise God's truth to appease the Mormon the deception. False doctrine is a lie and presenting it is such an appealing light only adds to the deception."
3,"Too Modern for Me -- A review of ""The Nativity""",I didn't know I was old fashioned until I read this book. The artwork everyone else espouses as `wonderful' just struck me as a little too funky; at least for 3 and 5 year olds.I'm trying to teach my young ones respect for our religion; they don't need to see Gabriel 'shuffling' down the street to have a coffee klatsch with Mary.Three Stars. Artwork was cute but this is not a book we would read to our young children.[HOWEVER** I offer the caveat that this book might -just might- be good choice for older children. This book could be a way of 'humanizing' the biblical figures: making them more accessible.]
5,"A beautiful, human presentation of Christ's birth.","The Illustrations by Ms Vivas bring to life the story of the birth of Jesus. Her touching art work brings to life the nativity story within a very human framework. I have personally given many copes of this book for gifts to friends. It is always well received, especially by adults."
5,The Nativity,"The Nativity, is illustrated brilliantly by Julie Vivas! It is a ""must have"" for your children's library. Her depiction of the angels, of Joseph confronting Mary's pregnancy, are priceless."
5,Heartwarming telling of the Nativity story,The artwork draws us into the humanity of Mary and Joseph's story and the birth of Jesus. Very earthy with a taste of humor!
5,Great book for any age,This book had a very cute approach to the nativity story. I like the illustrations. It was a lot of fun to read with my boys. Loved it.
5,Believable Mary!,"I received this book as a gift, and I absolutely love Julie Vivas' artwork. I like the Mary she portrays - having a cuppa with the scruffy non-intimidating angel, the homely details of laundry and emptying sand out of shoes. My favorite picture in the whole book is the one where Joseph is hefting a very pregnant Mary onto the donkey, and both of them are highly amused by the situation.My only complaint is that I would personally prefer a more contemporary text rather than the traditional King James Version. Otherwise, this book is perfect. For the record, the newer edition's cover photo just doesn't have the same impact as the bright red around Mary and Joseph. The newer one is less colorful and shows the shepherds peering in at the baby.Highly recommend!"
3,TOO hard to understand,"I was hoping for a nice story to read to my kids while we put up our nativity. we are non-religious but I still feel it's important for them to know the stories of the bible. This book was wording directly from the bible and hard to understand what exactly it was talking about. I was hoping for a general story about Joseph, Mary and baby Jesus."
4,Great album... But it's NOT Keyshia Cole,"This is a great late 90s R&B record. I have only had this one for a few days so I haven't been able to give it a thorough listen, but I can tell you that this is a hot album, aside from a few weak spots. Keesha is a great singer & I wish she had put out more material. But listen up... She is NOT Keyshia Cole contrary to the similarities and belief of others... But still, fans of late 90s R&B and R&B in general should pick this CD up."
2,Not helpful in preparing sermons,"I have read portions of this book, in preparation for sermons on various passages from John. Overall, I have been displeased with the content of the commentary and have found it generally unhelpful, which seems to be rare for an Interpretation commentary."
3,beautiful but not practical,These earrings are very pretty to look at but the stones are easily removed from their setting. I had mine on for about 2 hours and the stone popped right out when my hair got caught on an edge...I probably would not have bought had I known how fragile the setting was.
1,dont trust!,"this website's colors are not accurate especially for the cubic zirconia ""lavender"" earings they BARELY have any purple or ""lavender"" one can barely tell it has color! they are cheap and not worth your time!"
4,Solid and good value,"I wanted a mid-priced, quality saw with variable speed control. The Bosch RS5 won my vote. The price point was good, solid name, and the right features. It's not the lightest saw out there by any means, but it's got plenty of power and good grips. I've used it on two projects so far and have had no issues."
1,Two bad products bundles with good price,Printer :The driver disappers every time windows restarts.Photo quility it pooooooor.Camera:The Flash really burns the image at top left corner.FAT handling. Bad software navigation.I am considering to return the whole package.
4,Beautifully made,"It is a beautiful and well made toy. I only wish my 2 year old were as enchanted by it as I am. He is not much into blocks, but maybe he'll grow into them. The pieces can be stacked in the rack, which my son preferres to do, or not."
5,Exceeded expectations!,"HABA is a great company and this is an awesome block set. The concept in enhancing motor skills and imagination were beautifully achieved. My daughter was 15 months when she opened it for Christmas and it was undoubtedly her favorite toy. After she opened everything, she immediately started playing with it. Plus, it is so reassuring to know this product's paint truly is safe for my child. It is a bit expensive, but totally worth it! (It's cute and fun!)"
5,Forman shines,"How does Ruth Forman sleep at night. She must have a guilty conscience, because she's received more than her fair share of gifts. Wise beyond her years and possessed of a fine discretion that keeps her writing equipoised between embellishment and restraint, Forman, in Renaissance, has made a stridently quiet statement--open mike indulgence does not fully describe the parameters of the poetry being crafted by young writers of color-- for we are legion. With Rennaissance, Forman has emerged from the ranks of young American writers as a brave and able centurion. Where she leads I will follow."
5,"a subtle, extra edge",It is the extra satisfaction that you have done all it takes to enhance your image
5,Great product!,I purchased one of these products approx. 2 years ago and it still works perfectly. I ordered a second one recently to use in another bathroom in the house. Looking forward to using it for many years also. I highly recomend this product. Quality is great and length of hose is great. Well worth the money!
5,***This Book Is The Greatest!!!***,"This short children's novel is the best of it's class. Not only it is beutifully written, but just the thought of yourself being in Narnia is great! Also, this book proves that fairy tales are not only for children, but for adults too. I recommend this book for all people who like high tales."
5,Dog's favorite,"My cocker spaniel destroyed even the most ""durable"" toy I could find. The HchewO he has is over a year old and is still going strong. He loves to chew on this for hours on end. It gives him something to do and keeps him calm, when I cant take him for a walk. I can't find it in the stores anymore, so I'll be purchasing a couple for the future."
3,slwheel,"This does say that it is for ""Tiny Dog"" but the product Product Dimensions: 3.2 x 1.8 x 6.8 inches, this is not true. There is no part that is 6.8 inches. My dog loves to chew, he really loves the one that he already had but it was getting old, I still have to get the bigger one."
1,Waste of money.,"Alright, I'm not going to review each film as it wou take far to long. I'm rating this collection, the selection is fair at best and the the cost is WAY out of line. It nearly $13 each for this barebone disc is a waste. There is a big blue department store that you can get most of these for $5.50-$8.88. Not worth the price and if you like the collection it can be had much cheaper buying them one at a time. Save your money!"
1,Bad Idea,"I can't believe that anyone would actually buy this. The average price for these DVD's is still around $12.00 each. It's not a deal at all. If they bring it down to $5.00 each ($150.00 total) maybe I'd consider buying it. Even if I wanted to buy it and the price was right, I already have some of these. Why would I want more than one copy of a movie?"
3,Bare bones -- not much else -- waste of money,"I reviewed this book already once and for some odd reason the review never appeared. Well here I go again.This book is published by a company called ""Bare Bones"" .... well that's exactly what this is. The editorial comment was that it is ""entertaining"" and ""indispensable"" -- it is neither of those. This book is very, very, very basic. It does not cover all the grammar you need, as it would suggest. In fact, if I knew how little it covered I would have never purchased this book. One more thing buyers may wish to know, this book is put together much like a magazine -- just plain old stapled together, no binding at all.If I knew how little this book actually covered and how poorly formatted it was I would have never purchased it, ESPECIALLY for the high price! It isn't worth wasting your money over -- I wish I never bought it, spare yourself the same mistake."
1,I have to dissent...,"Most of the reviewers seemed to like this book a lot and recommended it highly. With their recommendations in mind, I went ahead to purchase the book (2 copies) to use for tutoring a high school student. Unfortunately, I was disappointed at the quality of the text (paper, font, number of pages) and the content. There's several pages on the use of commas, which is wonderful, but that's several pages out of not so many. So what's the substance of the rest of the book? Not a whole lot. I immediately returned this item back to Amazon. I suggest, if you need a good reference, to find a good grammar textbook (used in primary and secondary schools) or perhaps even the MLA Handbook - depending on what your needs are. This book, Grammar Blue Book, is a waste of money."
2,"Wish I had listened to ""Bare bones -- waste of money.""","The content is decent and concise, but the production quality of this book simply can't be forgiven. Ms. Straus likely had these printed up at Kinko's -- this ""book"" is really more a pamphlet with a card-stock cover over 68 pages of plain paper. This could be something to buy and hand out at a seminar, with the expectation that it would be worked through and then discarded, but I doubt very much that it will last long in even moderate use.This should be selling for $3, not $13. I wish I had listened to the earlier ""bare bones"" review."
5,Concise Review of Grammar,"The Blue Book of Grammar is an excellent resource for students and professionals alike. I teach medical transcription in a community college, and the book is invaluable in providing exercises on specific problems on which the students need the most help. There are answers to the exercises included. Terrific book!"
3,Not the best webcam out there,"I bought this webcam knowing it wasn't the best one out there because for a specific project I was having problems connecting two Logitech QuickCam Orbit webcams to the same computer and thought having a different brand camera to use with one of the Logitechs would make things work better. The Creative Webcam Live Motion works okay, but the software that comes with it is bloated and not nearly as nice as the software that comes with the Logitech camera. Creative says on their website that the version that runs with Vista is beta only. So if you're only looking for one webcam, I'd go with theLogitech QuickCam Orbit MP Webcam ( 961422-0403 )."
5,Wonderful,"For my work and other refrences, we should read more of the Kleins' work to guide and assist our understandings of the personality disorder. Highly recomended amd timely delivered in good condition."
2,Who Are These Kids?,"After listening to several urban songs from the Cedarmont Kids, I bought this hoping for a wider selection... To be politically correct, I will say there wasn't one urban sounding song on this CD...I'm not into an entirely soprano cd for my son so suffice it to say, this was a waste of my money!"
3,RED LINE 7000,"With The exception of the start of the movie when that MidYear Corvette Coupe comes out the whole rest of the movie is sadly one big ford fest, a Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe,Thunderbirds and a Shelby Stang. The musical portion is usual 60's bore and the dancing and being hippie is just as well, the racing action are scenes cobbled up together and it's all stock cars. I would say the movie is a must if your into stock cars and especially fords,there is at least two other movies that feature Riverside Raceway as a background and the French girl is annoying and probably smelly."
5,Great book but look out.,"If you pick up this book just for pure entertainment you will not be disapointed, the stories inside range from the merely wonderfull to the fantastic in quality.Great for a moment of reading durring morning commute or a moment of relaxation in a quet corner of a waiting room.If however you are like me, and you want more then just entertainment for its own sake you will find that this book reprisents allso the posibility of studing different tecniques and stiles of writing.Now, admitidly when you do this you run the risk of being a little confused, unlike a textbook the transition from one story and one tecnique to another is sudden, litterally the turn of a page, however there are few other examples out there where you can study and be entertained at the same time.Just dont let the entertainment distract you from the study."
5,Great Therapy Tool,"I have used What to Do When You're Scared & Worried with children in therapy. Most children are relieved to know that this is a common issue; in fact so common there is a book about it. Knowing other children have found solutions is reassuring for children. Appropriate for school, home, and clinical environments."
4,good overall...,"I am a bit hesitant to give this book 5 stars because I feel like some of the detail in the book can be overwhelming for the younger ages...especially 9 and 10 year olds. I bought the book b/c it was recommended and I have a son that has experienced anxiety issues. I'm also a licensed mental health professional. This book would be an excellent guide for parents.. but I would carefully review before you allow a younger child to read. The author has presented some excellent coping techniques for anxious kids. Overall, I do recommend this book.. but I would sit with the child and read through it. Don't plan to just hand it over..."
5,great,hi i'm victoria i have GAD. a really great book if you have fears or worries. i definetly reccomend this book for adults and kids. review by:victoria
4,Not bad at all,"well, anyone who believes that the ataris are a poppy punk band needs to search through their cd collection a little more closely. an old school punk band straight out of SOCAL. so long astoria definetley feeds on the 13 year old new school freaks a little more than the veterans but they still hold the torch to their previous albums, not bad at all guys."
5,Still the same old Ataris ...,"I'll admit ... when Ataris got signed to Columbia, yeah I was excited! But I was also afraid that being on a major label was going to affect their sound. I was still really looking forward to the album though. And all I have to say is ... it's still the same old Ataris ... it's still the same deep, meaningful lyrics from Kris Roe. The one thing I did notice about this album is it definitely shows how much the Ataris have grown. The majority of the lyrics aren't like usual Ataris songs about teenage boy/girl relationships; they're about more serious stuff. The whole concept of the album with Kris going back to his hometown and writing the lyrics for the album from memories is really really awesome. As a songwriter I have sooo much respect for the lyrics on this album. So bottom line, if your Ataris fan, this new album should only make you love the boys more. If you're not an Ataris fan yet, you will be."
4,good but not their best,this is a great cd for those of u pop/punk listners out there. it's all about broken hearts and growing up with geat melodies and guitar riffs. buy it dont burn it.
4,Very good CD,"After hearing In This Diary from MP3.com, I went out to buy this CD the week it came out. I had listened to their Blue Skies album a few times before, but was not a huge fan. However, once I got this CD, I played it over and over. My favorite songs on this are In This Diary, Boys of Summer and I Won't Spend Another Night Alone. My only complaint is that I got a little tired of the album after many listens. I would still encourage others to buy it, as well as check out other stuff from The Ataris, especially Blue Skies (My favorite Ataris song is 1*15*96)."
4,an excellent cd,"Their first major label cd, on Colombia, and it's very good. lots of songs on there are excellent, especially my favorite being ""takeoffs and landings."" the music is well written, but what do you expect from a brilliant writer like kris roe? definitely get this cd! it's great, although not quite up to ""blue skies, broken hearts... next 12 exits"""
