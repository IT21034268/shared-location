3,"Eh... does the job, but...","I bought mine as a cheap alternative to a CD changer for my car. On the whole, its a nice toy. I have several qualms with it, however..Driving on long trips, it will randomly just shut off, for no reason whatsoever. Power isnt interrupted and there are no disc errors. It just turns off.Random play.. probably skips over a good 40% of the songs on a CD. That becomes very irritating.The car power adapter doesnt fit in my cig lighter well, its as if its too long.The skip protection is great, however. Once you get past the long load time, the poor random, and the unnecessary skips, its a decent player - and a good deal for the price."
2,Disappointing Piece of Equipment,"I've used this player in my car and found it to be unable to keep track of where it leaves off from one session to another, despite setting it on Resume. The display is almost impossible to read, so it is difficult to tell what Mode is set, except by memorizing their sequence. The earbuds that come with this -- EARBUDS! -- are wholly inadequate. Despite the good quality of sound reproduction and the versatility of this unit in allowing you also to play MP3 recordings as well as CDs, it was not entirely what I expected. I have a lower-cost Phillips CD player that operates very well, though it doesn't handle MP3 format.This player does function, and does have good sound, but it has these annoying problems: poor display, rotten earbuds, and inability to Resume properly."
3,Need More Information,"I'm very interested in buying this book, but need more information. Please send me the Table of Contents from the front of the book. Thanks"
1,Very Early Version of The Runaways,"The quality of musicianship on these tracks is pretty raw since they were recorded live at some kind of house party in 1975, and were probably never intended to be heard by the world. This is the Runaways as a 3-piece. Joan Jett on guitar and Micki (Michael) Steele as bassist/vocalist. Michael used to be bassist in The Bangles. But the girls are about 15 years old on these recordings, and it sounds like it. If anyone wants to hear The Runaways at their best try these CDs: The Queens of Noise; Waitin' For The Night; and Live In Japan."
4,Great if you know what you're getting,"Yes, this is rough and raw and even hard to hear at times, but it's a great slice of history for fans of Joan Jett, Micki Steele, Sandy West, or The Runaways in general. These are the original three members of the band recording demo tracks and it is a fun comparison for their later work with Cherie, Lita, and Jackie/Vicki/Laurie. Kim Fowley's voice is in there, too, as the Svengali of the whole experiment. Please take it for what it is. If you're just a mild fan of The Runaways who loves Cherie's vocals and Lita on lead, don't buy this album. If you're a true fanatic, however, and want to hear some raw music with three budding musicians, it's a purchase you'll cherish. If nothing else, it's a great place to hear Joan play a little lead guitar, which is a rarity in and of itself considering she is the quintessential rhythm guitar player."
1,Can I get a refund?,"Listen to the bad reviews. Just listen.The sound quality is among the worst you'll ever hear on a cd. Literally, as another reviewer stated, sounds like it was recorded on a $10.95 home recorder. Bangle fanatics might give it a listen, as you can hear Michael (barely) doing the vocals."
3,Interesting piece of music history,"Yes it's true that the quality of the recording is not great, but as a fan of the Runaways, I found it entertaining from a historical perspective. It's very raw and gives you an up close feel in the development of the band with Micki Steele (future Bangle) in the line-up. It is not something I listen to on a regular basis as I do the other albums, but I'm glad I have it. I would recommend it for true Runaways and Joan Jett fans."
3,"A must have, but probably only for Runaways fans","Guys, like the other reviewers noted, this is NOT a professionally recorded album. The quality is not very good (this was likely thrown together on outtakes with a handheld tape recorder) right after the orignal band had just started out (Joan Jett, Kari Krome, Sandy West and that lead singer from The Bangles). I really like a few of the songs they never recorded with the formal Runaways group (like Let's Party Tonight) and it's very cool seeing how some of the songs evolved into what made it onto their first two albums.So for me, perfect. For others wanting a professional album and a good picture of what the Runaways were like in their heyday, well, probably not your best choice ;-)"
1,Born to be OUT OF PRINT,"I am an avid Runaways fan, and yet this was never meant to be released. Poorly recorded, this is an attempt by someone to cash in on Joan Jett's later success. For those interested in The Runaways, try their self titled debut, their second, Queens of Noise, or ""The Best of...""."
5,A Wonderful Cd,"I saw Lost and Found for the first time in St. Louis, and the songs that they played were very inspirational and well done. After the show I met them, and they are the two most down to earth guys I have ever met. When they perform, they go barefoot, and are really funny in between songs. I bought this cd and totally fell in love with many of the songs, including Slide Girl, Baby and Lions. If you are looking for musicians who write catchy and beautiful songs, then THIS cd is for you."
4,These guys are really good,"These two guys are really talented. Their songs are religious, but they don't have to scream Jesus' name every single song to get their point across. ""Baby"" is a great song, and so is ""Lions."" The tempos (sp??) are nice, and the sounds are good. I saw these two at a concert recently, as in like 3 days ago, and I'm already hooked. I sincerely suggest getting ""THIS"" CD. Like I said, they're super talented and the messages are touching. GREAT BUY!!!"
4,These guys are awesome.,"I first heard of Lost and Found when they played a concert for my church. They are so funny! I was laughing the whole time! I bought their CD, and i enjoy listening to it. Most of the songs are great, especially the last one, Lions."
3,A few I was looking for; the rest not to my taste,"I was looking for a few specific tracks (Baby, Lions, Slide Girl) which I'd heard elsewhere, and which get a good 4.5 (I'm less a fan of Lost And Found's style than their songs). I wasn't overly impressed by the rest of the songs on the CD."
3,Doesn't keep it very cold.,"I don't think it's very well insulated, but it's large enough to carry a bottle, and a pacifier, which is convenient."
5,How the Social World Works,"This is a must read for those who want to understand the mechanics of the social/work world. Though its language is difficult, the message is extremely helpful to anyone who has been caught in a undesirable social/work situation."
1,Better get it right the first time,"Absolutely a pain to put on, and if you mess it up (i.e., get it even slightly dusty, place it just slightly off of perfect alignment, etc.) you're going to be disappointed. May have been satisfied with it if it had gone on right the first time, but now I have a screen protector that's got little dimples of dust/air in several places."
1,Hard to put on,I wound up with airbubbles and the screen looked terrible so I took it off and threw it out. Kept the cloth but not worth the money to me.
3,second edition-same book as first,"I purchased the second edition since I have the first. Unfortunately, unless you are into the recent changes in the cocker spaniel field trials and field bred cockers, there is little or no changes. It is practically the same book. Since the first edition can be found in hardcover, and is a top gundog book, I would recommend buying that one unless you are interested in the cocker spaniel as a field dog."
2,Long and tedious,"Hup! training flushing spaniels the american way Long and tedious, I gave up, and didnt like the suggestions. I really dont want my yard to look like a wasteland."
5,"The very best of his pop/R&B albums, in my view.","Firmly rooted in the pop/R&B genre and done exceedingly well. Bought the cassette years ago for a song ($3.99) and would like to find the CD now.The upbeat, friendly ""Mornin,"", ""Boogie Down"" and ""Trouble in Paradise"" got huge air play but ""Not Like This"", a sorrowful and moving ballad about love lost, is actually my favourite. It is deftly followed by the optimistic ""Love Is Waiting"", another lesser known but super cut marked by some nifty horn work in its intro.The very best of his pop/R&B albums, in my view."
5,Classic!,"This is a perfect R&B record; great songs, great arrangements, and a killer band. Al is in top vocal form on this date and the joy he brings to the material is palpable and infectious. A must have for any R&B/Jazz enthusiast."
4,Jarreau and Graydon strike again,"This was the third Al Jarreau album to be produced by Jay Graydon, and one of his best. Featuring the hit song ""Mornin'"" which the two wrote with David Foster who plays here along with the usual L.A. studio cats of the day, it is a must."
1,Beware,"The clock is exactly what I thought I was getting, in so far as material quality and appearance. However, the clock portion only worked for a very short time. The minute hand keeps getting hung up on the hour hand, so therefore, it really doesn't do what it's suppose to do. There is no way to take the face of the clock off to adjust the clock hands."
2,Not an outdoor clock!,This clock appealed to me because I thought it would be a nice gift for a pool owner that I know. It has rusted and stopped working due to being outside. I do not recommend this as an outdoor item.
5,How can they possibly top this one?,"Great writing with excellently crafted characters. I could really get into the story and found myself holding my breath in fear, anticipation and hope more than once. Wonderful humor used appropriately and of course the signature Weber & Ringo military strategies. In an nutshell..when's the next one?"
3,Wait for the next one.,"David Weber always writes a great book, and this one, with John Ringo, is no exception. But - it does nothing to move the plot along. There is a 3rd book coming. My advice - wait to buy this one until #3 is out."
2,A let-down after _March Upcountry_,"I like Weber's work generally, and I enjoyed the prequel to this book, but I almost couldn't get through this one.There's some good stuff here. The plot's interesting, and includes worthwhile character development and compelling hints about what's going on in the broader setting, out in the galaxy. It also becomes clear that we're looking at a long book series; the characters are nowhere near the end of their travails.But: although I like military fiction in general, this book gets bogged down in looong passages about tactics, artillery, manufacturing schemes for ammunition, &c.; ad nauseum. My subjective impression is that more than half the book was not critical to the storyline--more fun for an avid reader of National Defense Magazine than a science fiction nut or follower of Prince Roger and his loyal crew.If Prince Roger hooked you in _March Upcountry_, buy it in paperback and be prepared to skim heavily. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
3,Too Many Similar Characters,"I liked March Upcountry, the first in this series by Mr. Weber, but I found myself having trouble concentrating on March to the Sea, book two, mostly because the cast has grown to about 30+ characters and the multiple POV switching began to drive me a bit nutty. It would be one thing if these characters were different, but I found the aliens and their culture to be too human, and to find the alien characters almost virtually interchangeable.I liked Prince Roj, Portena and some of the other characters, but they seem to take a back seat to some minor characters in this book. Perhaps this book would be better with a few hundred pages edited out?Good, but not great. 3 stars."
1,Could have stopped with the first book,"I really liked March Upcountry, so when I saw this one, I snapped it up. Big mistake. I didn't even finish it--there's no character development, no real moving forward of the plot. Now that Roger is grown up, I guess there's nothing more to write about."
3,Out Dated,"According to this book... there are only 3 races: white, black, and ""yellow"". It's just not with the times and funeral directors really new a book that's with the times. Not from the late 1940's."
4,Would that it were longer,"A wonderful essay all in all, and quite pithy at points. I only wish it were longer.Newbigin shows how both the Enlightenment project and many Christians in its wake make the error of seeking absolute certainty on (purportedly) neutral ground. All worldviews require unprovable faith commitments, and the sooner Christians leave behind those of Descartes, his logical heir Nietzsche, et al., the better.While Newbigin does a fine job of demonstrating the necessary priority of faith and faith as the only possible ground of certainty, I wish he had added a little more about what it means to recognize this and live by it."
2,Not a fan of the Green Edition books,"I purchased this book months ago and plan to give it away. I am use to the Mindware quality coloring books and these from Dover just do not compare. The paper is more porus, there is bleed through and the designs are on both side of the paper. Would not consider ordering more Dover books. The designs in the book are very detailed and small. I do not think I would enjoy them regardless."
3,OK,"This coloring book is a good product, I personally just didn't care for it as much as I thought I would. Has nothing to do with quality, presentation or the merchant. I would still buy product from this merchant."
5,Great!,Love it. want more soon! I've been coloring since I got the book. I'm hoping I can find more like this.
4,Nice designs,Double sided pages make this colorable only with colored pencils unless you photocopy the pages. Bought as a stress reliever for myself.
3,Great designs BUT double-sided,"The designs are double-sided, so these pages are NOT good for removing & framing, or for any wet media, which is what I use. I'm very disappointed for this will require me to make copies of any designs in order not to bleed through to the other design. Usually when double-sided, scanning & copying makes the back of page design show through, so no clean copies. The paper is thin & a bit off-white, so copies may not be clean either. As for the designs, they are finely detailed, can be colored in many combinations to bring different features into focus, suitable for adults and teens."
4,A little wild for me.,"I purchased this coloring book during the 4 for 3 promotion. While I love the Geometrical Design Coloring Book this 3-D coloring book makes my eyes go crazy!Please don't get me wrong, the designs are amazing and the coloring opportunities are endless. It's just that my brain has trouble viewing the 3-D designs. To use a phrase from my youth, this book just, ""Blows my Mind"". When you start coloring a picture it literally appears to be 3-D.So I guess I'd say, ""Get the 3-D Designs coloring book at your own risk!"" Fun but messes with your mind."
5,the military and military history from perspective of objects and artifacts,"This work is a part of the series named ""Artefacts"" associated with London's Science Museum, whose editors ""encourage authors to use objects as evidence for their studies of the history of science and technology."" The eleven chapters of this volume were written by authors from universities and museums. The topics vary widely, from 15th-century Valois Burgundian artillery, World War I U.S. women's uniforms, the display of arms in museums, artifacts of the German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands in WWII, to the use and image of U.S. submarines in the Cold War. The essays get at what can be learned about the respective military forces of the time and also what can be learned about the relationship between such forces and the society of which they were a part."
4,Pyaar Impossible Blu-ray,"Minus one star for repackaging the Blu-ray, false advertising. It's suppose to be brand new! Saw several scratches on the disc. Other than that, had no problems playing the movie."
3,"""Impossible"" is Accessible, Enjoyable, but Forgettable","A fun, accessible, but ultimately forgettable Bollywood romantic comedy. It has all you expect (and perhaps love) about Bollywood--a simple plot, lots of colorful song and dance, and tame romantic scenes (their lips never touch). What I miss is the over-the-top glam that usually accompanies these tales. Because this one is set in the nerdy world of the software business, they are more limited by their colorless subject matter. Still, you can't go wrong here, and it makes for an enjoyable viewing, especially for westerners who may not be as familiar with Bollywood productions (much of the dialogue is in English)."
3,Well...,"This is just an OK release from Shoestrings, but I head from the label that they were working on FAR better material (see the track on the Darla 100 4-disc set for an idea of where they were headed) but then just lost interest and stopped.A shame. They had such promise."
3,"Soft, pleasant, yet somewhat undistinguished","I gave this a listen purely for its being on Le Grand Magistery's label, and it is a departure from silly keyboard acts like Momus and Mr. Wright. Personally I thought the album lacked oomf, but if you prefer softer emotional pieces, you could do a lot worse. Their name is fitting, as the music is nice to have but is ultimately inconsequential."
4,Love over Gold more solemm than usual,"When Dire Straits released their debut back in 78 with Sultans of Swing the bluesy catchy song sent people scurrying out to buy this album and for the most part weren't disappointed.Four years later this album was released.Although expecting to find a similiar sounding album what I got was a collection of a more transitional pieces of music.Telegraph Road runs 14:20,while the rest are under 8 minutes.Industrial Disease is kinda humorous in its sick way and It Never Rains shine with a masterful guitar solo which makes up for the ones you don't hear as it was drowned by Alan Clark.Perhaps it would of been different if David Knopler hadn't of left but a change had to come for the better.Although it is wasn't a comercial success its in a class all by itself."
1,Too bad you cant listen to it on your computer.,This CD contains copy protection so that you cannot listen to it on a Mac or a PC.
1,Nothing but Clicks and Pops. Not at all like new.,Avoid this vendor. He'll cheat you. He advertised the item as like new but it wasn't. Nothing but clicks and pops.
2,Rather weak,"After three more or less great albums, Dire Straits released ""Love over gold"" in 1982. This album is not at all comparable to the earlier stuff and only the song ""Telegraph road"" reach former heights. In fact, ""Love over gold"" is a rather boring album and the material lacks the attractiveness of tunes like ""Sultans of swing"" and ""Tunnel of love"" to name a few. I would say that this album is mostly for dedicated Dire Straits fans."
5,Telegraph Road is one of rock's finest epic songs.,"Other reviewers have said it all below -- this is Dire Straits' finest album. Telegraph Road is a fifteen-minute cinematic masterpiece - on every level: the melody, the arrangement, the atmospherics, the distinct and perfect contributions of each band member, and above all the way it builds. A long lonely whistle... a story of 'progress'...a story of love struggling against a backdrop of economic depression... and the rousing ending that comes on like ten, twenty, a hundred galloping horses. I hadn't listened to it in a couple years, just put it on last week... it's amazing when the artistic beauty of a rock song can move the listener to near tears."
5,One of their best,"Two words: ""Telegraph Road,"" which is quite simply one of the most beautiful, somehow simultaneously heartbreaking and uplifting songs ever written. 14+ minutes is not too long, and you owe it to yourself to hear it in its entirety. (The crimes committed against it within the ""live remix"" on the _Money for Nothing_ compilation aren't quite as bad as those committed against that album's title track, but they're still pretty bad.)It's got to be between this and _Making Movies_ for the title of Best Dire Straits Album. _MM_ has a few more songs, which is a definite positive. Then again...have I mentioned, ""Telegraph Road""?"
5,The Best Dire Straits Album EVER!,"Before Mark Knopfler and Co. was ""Calling Elvis"" and getting doing the ""Walk of Life"" and getting ""Money For Nothing"", he put out a masterpiece album. I bought this album in 1983 after I heard ""Industrial Disease"" on the radio (Which happened to be the first Straits song on the radio since Lady Writer or Making Movies). Mark Knopfler is a great storyteller, probably better than Springsteen (Telegraph Road creates vibrant images of a town built from scratch to the recession of Reagan's first term). Private Investigations probably builds more suspense than most of today's movies. Knopfler's guitar work is stellar, although Telegraph Road could be cut to about 10 minutes (half of it is guitar, anyway). This album is like fine wine: It gets better with age and should be opened at the right occasion."
4,could be better,"I have not tried all these songs yet but maybe in the feature.The only song I have ever liked off this CD was Telegraph Roadbecause it was 14 minutes and it had a true story about a longtime ago came a man on a track walking thirtie miles with a sackon his back. Other than that, in my opinion Private Investigations is the weakest song off this cd. So if you gota plan to buy this CD, go buy it now."
1,Pretty awful,"Wow,how can anyone like a bad as bad as Dire Straits.they are as bad as Green Day and Foriegner.they only made one good song sultans of swing.Telegraph road has to be one of the most moronic songs ever.DONT BUY ANY ALBUM FROM DIRE STRAITS,FOREIGNER OR NIRVANA.GET ANY BEATLES album instead."
1,OUCH! DIRE STRAITS ARE TERRIBLE,"I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT DIRE STRAITS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY OVER RATED BAND.THEY ONLY MADE ONE GOOD ALBUM IN THEIR DEBUT.MARK KNOPFLER IS A REALLY BORING SINGER AND THEIR GUITARING WAS ALWAYS BLAND AND UNINSPIRING.I WOULD REQUEST YOU TO AVOID THIS BORING ALBUM AND GET ALBUMS FROM GREAT BANDS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,AC/DC,BOSTON,QUEEN,THE WHO,THE ROLLING STONES AND BLACK SABBATH."
1,G-A-R-B-A-G-E,LOVE OVER GOLD IS CERTAINLY THE WORST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD.IT IS EVEN MORE WORSE THAN AMERICAN IDIOT AND WARNING BY GREEN DAY.ALL THESE RUBBISH ALBUMS DESERVE NO STARS.TELEGRAPH ROAD IS THE LOUSIEST SONG EVER WRITTEN.HEED MY ADVISE AND AVOID THIS LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.GET ANY ALBUM FROM BLUE CHEER OR IRON BUTTERFLY INSTEAD.
1,Nelly is wack,"Only 2 tracks stand out, Country Grammer and EI the rest suck. Pimp juice is f*cking annoying and dilemma is bullsh*t. dilemma is one of the most annoying songs ive ever heard. and nelly turned pop and a washed up rapper."
3,A Pianist's Pianist,"Angelic Piano presents a tasteful collection of tastefully wrought arrangements. The mix includes traditional hymns and now-traditional contemporary Christian tunes. Though some of the tracks, such as 9 ""Because He Lives"", remind me of Zanphir the panpipe guy, most are not so much drowned in corny emotion. The piano predominates, with synth effects subtle. Playing is clean, musical, and not too flashy. Meditation is this album's best application. It was the icing on the cake in a prayer service here, after the events of September 11, providing an ambiance throughout, with poetry and scripture superimposed at intervals."
3,Good info but very basic,Learned some things so it was worth the buy but far from a comprehensive work. Could use a lot more illustrations and failure analysis checklists.
4,better than PETA...,"This is a lovely little book that provides a very well rounded discussion as to how Christians can better think about other animals. In light of the covenant God makes with Noah (that includes all animals), in light of the fact that humans were first commanded to eat of trees (meat-eating only occurs after the fall---very significant), and in light of Isaiah 11, where all creatures, human and non-human, will coexist on God's holy mountain, how should we treat animals in the here and the now? For people who believe that God is the creator of all things, there has to be a difference...maybe it is not vegetarianism, but still, there has to be some difference--and this book will help get you started on what that difference is."
2,HORRIBLE,"There is nothing in the construction of the cables to hold the ends into the jacks - and they don't like to stick in the jacks of the TV or in my switch.Also, since there are two red jacks, most cables give a bit of a separation in them - these don't, so you have to be VERY careful to get the correct ones hooked up.IMHO - spend a few bucks more and get better quality ones.(NOTE: I have purchased many other things from this seller and been very happy, this is the first time that I have been unhappy with my purchase)"
2,Not a bargain but acceptable.,"These cables are a bit cheezy. They work fine but most electronics you buy throw in higher quality wiring than this. As with a lot of factory cables, they hotmelt the plastic over the RCA plugs. This is mostly good but quality control on mine must have blinked because I had a big air bubble exposing the center wire on one end of six. I just put a glob of silicone in the hole and used it anyway."
1,What I received was not what was in the picture,"The cables I received are not the ones I ordered in the picture. The video cables in the picture have much larger, more substantial cables than the audio cables, whereas the the ones I received have video cables with the same tiny cables as the audio cable. If this is what I wanted I could have got those for less than half the price of these.Edit - While I didn't get the cables I ordered, the response from CableBuilders was even better than I could have hoped. A definite +1 for how they handled this. Everyone makes mistakes, it's how the mistakes are handled that makes the difference."
2,Don;t bother,"I don't know if I am confused or if this is just not what I wanted but there weren't 750,000 images. It is not that easy to follow and hard to find the pictures or images. I ended up uninstalling it and just put it aside in case I need it sometime. I think it was a waste of my time and money."
1,Misrepresentation of the Facts,"The language in this book is verbose, hard to read, one almost has to be a college professor to understand it. Once you do get through it, you find that the authors, while putting forth facts about the concerns between maintaining a militia and not having a large standing army, totally ignore facts that show that the intent all along, of both federalists and anti-federalists, was to protect a pre-existing, God given right of individuals to keep and bear arms, for any reason, including hunting and self-defense, but most importantly to resist a potentially tyrannical government. They also repeat standard gun control arguments, e.g. the word ""bear"" only had a military context when it came to firearms, even though the minority report from Pennsylvania expressly requested an amendment that would protect the individual's right to ""bear"" arms for hunting. Such is the nature of books with an agenda, spinning facts and propagating half-truths and lies."
3,Yikes! 20 feet close focus,"OK ... sorry for the 3 stars, but I just wanted to point out that these binoculars have a whopping 20 feet close focus distance. That's about the worst I've seen. For example, the Eagle Optics Denali 8x42 Roof Prism Binocular have a close focus of 7 feet. People new to binoculars often don't think about close focus, but it's highly desirable. For example, one may be looking at a bird in bush or tree and step closer to get a better look. At 20 feet, you may have to actually step back. Also, for younger kids, they like to look at objects closer to get used to using binoculars for the first time. Sometimes it's useful to look at insects, snakes, etc. that aren't 100 feel away but more like 10-20 feet. I just wanted to make those aware of close focus, so you can make your own educated decision."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought these because they had long eye relief for a girl friend with glasses to use, and because they were cheap. It is difficult to get the right eye adjusted, because the adjustment ring is very hard to turn. The focus is very slow-you have to turn the knob a lot to focus a little. They won't focus very close, and the field of view is very narrow. I didn't realize how poor they were until I compared them to a pair of Bushnell 8x40 porro prism binoculars of the same cost. Despite having larger objective lens the Barskas were noticeably darker, and the image quality was poorer. You'll get a lot more for your money with porro prism models. If you have to have roof prism binoculars, don't get these, and try before you buy!"
1,Worst Binoculars Ever,"I wanted some inexpensive, waterproof binoculars with good eye relief. I only wanted an extra pair to put in the car. I should have used these sooner, because I would have returned them immediately. The clarity is terrible and reminds me of toy binoculars. Only the very center of the image is in focus and even the center isn't very clear. I don't understand how these could possibly receive positive reviews. Perhaps mine are defective, but I strongly recommend not taking a chance."
3,lemon?,"i received these binoculars right on time but when i tried to use them i found a split in the water proof seam at the center focus, i was unable to turn the center focus wheel unless i kept them wide open, my eyes also could not fit the lenses, i decided to return them and amazon was awesome! i ordered a pair of bushnell with fully multi coated optics,porro prism, bak4, water proof and amazing eye relief for a little bit more money i was very, very happy (FULLY MULTI COATED makes a huge difference, multi coated is ok and fully coated is just a waste of time)i saw that others did very well with these but i did not."
2,response,they were good for the first week but the eye caps started falling off and damaged then it took two months from the date of sending them back for the repairs
3,Not very sharp,"I have several pairs of binoculars, from inexpensive to fairly expensive. Of the 5 I own, the recently purchased Barska are by far the least sharp. As another reviewer noted, they do not ""snap"" into focus as most do. Instead, they come into focus, but the image is not quite sharp. In fact, these are not nearly as sharp as the less-expensive Bushnell Permafocus binocs that I own. For the money, I'd recommend those over the Barska Blackhawk. They will go into my boat both because they are waterproof and because I could live with losing them on the water."
4,Mom of 2,I love the swim belt. Your child does not have to worry about staying afloat; so they can concentrate on the arm and leg movement.
5,A Classic That I've Loved For A Long Time,"The Earth, Moon, and Mars are under attack from Jovian invaders. The Nadesico is a privately owned battleship crewed by civilians. Civilians that happen to be very talented. The crew fights to protect humanity from the Jovians and have a little fun. This anime crosses over so many genres. Action, comedy, sci-fi, harem, drama, mecha, and romance. It's very broad. There are also tons of awesome characters. The characters are what make this anime so frickin great. This was one of the first series I ever bought; and over 200 later I still go as far as to call it a legend. You need this anime. I hope you love it as much as I do."
1,ah nuts!,"She writes like an insane person - an insane, boring person. All, 'It was fun. It was great. I liked it. The park was twenty-seven feet west of Keney Road and set back a little, veering south-easterly and almost butting into Mr and Mrs Ronald Boswell's rose garden! Then I did a perfect half-gainer and everybody thought I was marvellous. Dad put his boots on and we all had tea. What fun we had.' I don't care what sort of amazing life old Kate had, wading through her choked, stuttery prose is torturous and wearying... Then I finished the book. It was dumb."
5,WOW HOLD ON,Yea so she wanders back and forth and speaks in her own way. The way an autobiograpy should be wrote. I found the book to be WONDERFUL. One of the best books I have ever read. Katharine Hepburn in her own words!!! She is the most amazing person I know and the best actress there has every or will every be!! For those of you that did not like it. You have got alot to learn about life! I especially loved the part about Spencer it came from the heart not a typewritter.
4,Wonderful Book!,"I have not yet finished this book, but so far I love it! The only reason I picked this book up was because I thought Katharine was related to Audrey Hepburn! Once I found out she wasn't, I was disappointed. But I decided to continue to read it. It is very good and I will be sad when it ends. I found it a bit dull a first when she was telling about her family, but when I got furthur in, it was very exciting."
2,Me,"Not what I expected. I guess I was hoping for some ""juicy"" type stuff. Her stories just weren't that interesting to me (other than her hurricane experience). I have always thought her to be not only a fine actress, but a fascinating individual in her personal life as well. I didn't find any of that in this book."
5,"THE ACTOR, THE WRITER","AFTER READING THE MAKING OF THE AFRICAN QUEEN BY KATHARINE HEPBURN, I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN IN A ROOM WITH HER WHILE SHE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT. HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY, ""ME"", AGAIN BRINGS THE AUTHOR INTO YOUR HOME ""TELLING"" YOU FACE TO FACE, ALL OF THE AMAZING , FUNNY, SAD, VIVID INCIDENTS IN HER LIFE.A FABULOUS READ!!"
3,"Interesting, yet confusing!","I enjoyed the book very much. Ms. Hepburn's stories of her life are very interesting, indeed. The book shows that she had quite a memory; many diverse adventures; and a great love of family and friends. At first, I found it confusing when she would crisscross back and forth through years while recalling an account in her life. After a chapter or two, I became used to it!"
3,Disjointed Book,I felt this book rambled on about too many items and did not fully develop any one thought until later chapters near the end. Perhaps it was because the author's recollection was more vivid about recent happenings than earlier years. Even all the years she spent with Spencer Tracey were only covered in four pages. I found this book a bit disappointing as well as boring.
3,Like a conversation,"I picked up this book because I'm a volunteer at the cemetery where Ms. Hepburn is buried. I felt like I wanted to know more about her, and also about her family, since they are all buried there. I enjoyed the first couple of chapters the most, because they take place in Hartford, and getting a ""look"" at the town as it was before highways, when you could tie a sled to the back of a car and be pulled down Sigourney Street. Most of the book is devoted to her career. I'd say that she was mostly likeable, and had many interesting friends. The book was a very quick read, with lots of photographs."
5,"A Superb Album from ""The Voice of the Kurdish people""!!","Sivan Perwer is the voice of the Kurdish people and Kurdistan. He is absolutely the greatest and most famous Kurdish musician of all time. His powerful voice, passionate melodies, deep feelings and masterful instrumental arrangements make him one of the most important figures of world music today. I haven't listened to the whole CD, but as I can see, it contains some of Sivan's best lawiks and songs beside some classical lawiks.This album is the best introduction to Sivan's music. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!"
4,Good guitar,It is a very nice looking guitar. Very impressive on first looks. It sounded pretty good and the nylon guitar strings were very good on the fingers. The only problem was that three of the strings were nylon and three were metallic. That means you have spare some time to change all of them to the ones you like.Thanks.
4,Good Start,"When I first took guitar lessons a long time ago, the school used Yamaha C-40's. Although I know own guitars that are more expensive, I have a fond appreciation for the C-40.It is what it is, and what it is is a very good solution for those who do not want to spend a lot of money but yet venture into the classical guitar. I think it is somewhat futile to acid test this guitar much further than that. Sure, it is rather light in construction, but it's affordability and playability compensate for that.If you're starting, this is a nice guitar to start with."
4,Good starter guitar,"I bought a Yamaha C-40 on EBay for $60 (and had to add strings, so I guess that was another few bucks). But it is a nice-sounding guitar, the type I learned on in the early 70s. Back then I transferred easily after a couple years to my Gibson J-45 acoustic. But I wanted a guitar for my office that wasn't so valuable an item and this has filled the bill beautifully. Easy and fun to play."
4,good deal!,I am very happy from my purchase. The guitar sounds very pleasent and the price is totally fair. ThankX :))
4,"Okay, not the best, but a very good value.","This Yamaha guitar is not the absolute best, but it is way more than adequate for a beginner or even an intermediate player. I can't give it 5 stars, but for the price, it certainly deserves the 4 stars."
4,Good instrument for the price,Got my Yamaha guitar a few months ago and considering I am not a professional musician I am very much happy with the sound and performance of my instrument.
2,you get what you pay for,"I own several Yamaha musical instruments. I purchased the C40 assuming that the overall quality would be good and that the acoustical sound would be at best acceptible. The one that I received was defective in that it buzzed/vibrated when certain notes were played (sympathetic body vibrations). Also, it could not be played in tune-i.e. the fret/nut/bridge alignment was off. So. I suppose this is typical for a $100 entry level guitar. Perhaps I got a bad one. I know that guitars, even the same brand and model, differ greatly from one to another."
5,Great combination,"Make no mistake: this is a wonderful performance of two great works, surprisingly rare combination. There is a lot of energy in both works (essential in these very compositions) and music-making of highest calibre: wonderful. Thanks, Iona Brown!"
3,How to do your best on Law School Exams,Purchased this book to use as preparation for answering Law School exams. I followed the methodology in my answers for the exams but so far it has not made much of a difference in my grades. Could have done without it.
2,OH NO-- More acronyms!,"I also bought Getting to Maybe as an alternate test specific law prep book and I infinitely preferred it; I got half way through How to Do Your Best on Law School Exams and just put it down. For me, it took too much energy translating the various acronyms for different subject matter answer patterns, and the jargon is pretty thick. The crowded graphics, charts, and different typefaces, and the use of his own personal contractions in the examples made this book a slog, and without real concentrated effort to understand his ""method""(which I would much rather spend on other studying) I didn't really glean much that could be useful. Professor Delaney clearly knows his stuff, but this is not the right book for me."
2,Alright,"the book will most likely not help you that much in lawschool. ive come 2 find that each professor is nuanced in how they want their exams written and using this book as a catch all method just wont cut it for a lot of classes. it is better than nothing, but i wouldnt read it and think i mastered the mysteries of law school after having done so"
5,Best Method for attacking exams and hypos,"This book took me to a whole new level as far as being able to attack hypotheticals and practice exams. Before picking up this book, I thought wordy was better and often found myself rambling and/or not correctly spotting the issues in hypos. After reading this book and applying the CIRI(P) method, my answers are concise, but strike right to the heart of the issues. I highly recommend this book."
3,Packaging a problem.,"Radiator was as expected, packaging was not good enough to make it through UPS. The box was single thickness with no support in the center where the core of the radiator needs protection. I ended up with two rub spots that almost made me return the item. If I had time I would have returned, but when the rig had been sitting in the shop for a week already. I wont be ordering any more radiators that need to be shipped UPS or Fedex."
4,An useful work,"As a Professor of History of Music at the Conservatory, this book is a great improvement for my library..."
1,The mad mad world of 'Big Daddy'...,"This is a perfect example of the difference between musicians, and real music. It hurts to hear some of these uninspired lyrics. Hurts. You can be an ok 'musician' and make a rockin record...but this is a case of good musicians making a bad record. I would like to hear them try less, and rock more.. maybe less lyrics...maybe no lyrics... ""ozzy voice"" is in the house!"
2,Rush meets Ozzy,"When I first heard this album, I thought it was a quick knock-off of the Rush style of rock music coupled with Ozzy Osbourne vocals. I quickly filed it to the back of my mind and went on to better albums. Then I woke up one morning with the song ""Big City Life"" raging through my head. Maybe there's something more to this mad duo of Big Daddy and Freddie. We'll see....we'll see."
4,An excellent read,"The Open Door provides an interesting look at a girl coming of age in 1950's Egypt. She has to reconcile her love of country with her commitment to her family and its morals; her desire to embrace feminist ideals of equality; and whether she has a right to pursue a life full of love brought on by desire, or whether she should stick with the 'fundamentals' that would provide her with loveless security.There are periods when the book reads like a romance novel, but they move along quickly and are replaced with something much greater and socio-politically interesting. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested women's political involvement in the Middle East and how the political turmoil of 1950's Egypt affected the average family."
3,Not Bad,I bought this game because I am a Sabrina the teenage witch fan.It turned out to be fun game actually. But a little too easy. I beat it within 4 days. All you have to do is collect all 12 clock pieces. The camera control was a little awkward but you'll get used to it. Overall it was a pretty good game. I would recommend it to any one who likes games that are simple to play and/or are a Sabrina the teenage witch fan.
1,I hate this game,"My sisters, my cousin, and I all agree this game is horrible. This game isn't good for anybody. The graphics are bad, her ""powers"" are, and the enemies are pathetic! If you want to waste your time and money, buy this game. If you want a good game, try Threads of Fate."
3,Unnecessary Rockabilly/Doo Wop Mac,"Fleetwood Mac / Kiln House: While this is a pleasant recording, it is an unnecessary and thoroughly forgettable album. The band, reminiscing on the early days of Rock N Roll do some Rockabilly and Doo Wop songs that add little to their history or the history of rock. Peter Green had left the band but they still had to put out an album for the record company. This is not a band in transition; this is a band in neutral."
5,"Ah, Glorious...Glorious...Glorious...!","Spring semester 1971....Santana ""Abraxis"", The Who ""Live At Leeds"", The Doors ""LA Woman"", The Stones ""Sticky Fingers"", Fleetwood Mac ""Then Play On"" and ""Kiln House"". An embarrassment of riches that seemed like it would go on forever. They were always on the turntable, and years later when the nasty fact that CDs just didn't sound as good as LPs reared it's ugly head, these were the albums that I had to re-acquire. ""Kiln House"" seeped into your bones, and was simply magical. Years later, while playing in my umpteenth bar band, I asked the bass player his favorite desert island album cuts, ""'Station Man' Fleetwood Mac"", he said immediately and without a moments hesitation. My estimation of him rose to new heights. If you don't have this album or ""Then Play On"", then you have got to rectify this at once!"
5,Bob Woodruff CD,Excellent CD by Bob Woodruff. He is without a doubt an underrated country artist. It's a shame he didn't write & produce more songs and CD's. Purchase was quick and easy and was received within a couple days. Excellent experience.
4,One of Folk Music's Best Kept Secrets,"I first heard James Keelaghan sing at a folk festival about seventeen or eighteen years ago. He has a fantastic voice and range, and is a first rate singer/song writer. I think the fact that many of his songs are historical in nature, and some Canadian in subject matter are the reasons that he has not received general widespread recognition like his countrymen Gordon Lightfoot and Leonard Cohen. This is one of his earlier ""classic"" albums on which his talent is abundantly displayed."
5,All Time Favorite,"Our old tattered copy of The Little Brute Family has always been a favorite of my children and grandchildren. When I saw that is was going to bee published again, I preordered five copies. I have been looking for more copies of this book for years. It is our all time favorite, a simple story with a beautiful message."
5,Wow,"I had the pleasure of seeing Aaron in concert when I was in Ft. McMurray for the Arctic Winter Games last winter and also got to meet him. I had always loved 'You Can't Hide Beautiful"" but had not heard any of his other songs until the concert.Well, I LOVED his music and he sounds exactly like he does on the radio, which is an added bonus. His voice is so pure and he seems to really be singing from his heart, which it seems like lately a lot of musicians are not.I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes catchy, but meaningful songs."
3,ultra pinball thrillride,The graphics on this game is not as good as i expected. It seems that it was created mainly to get me to buy candy.
3,ughhh,Horrible. piece of cr*p. didnt like it my son hated it. So did I its cheaplymade with velcro in the back. But hey i guess you get what you pay for. Right??
4,Very nice but not definitive,"Luscious sound by a very competent orchestra. Splendid, spacious outer movements where the beautiful strings really shine.However, regarding the second movement (Andante), I`m more used to a slower, more heart-felt tempo (example- Bernstein/Vienna/1990 on DG, at 11 minutes) than Ashkenazy`s 10 minutes. The playing is quite fine, yet what is actually conveyed is more straight-forward and meticulous. I basically listened to this movevement rather than preferring to experience it emotionally. To me, this movement is the most important of the whole symphony.Still recommended, but not unforgettable."
2,Terrible problems in the new 3rd edition,"I really enjoyed previous books in this series, but this volume has a number of problems. Proofreading of the text was next to non-existent, with many typographical errors. A daunting number of errors in the board diagrams make them difficult to follow, especially for a novice. This is especially surprising for a book in its 3rd edition.I hoped to ask for some kind of errata, but samarkand.net is defunct and I can't find a website for Good Move Press. If this book was a washing machine, I would return it as defective.All of this said, the book is ambitious and maintains many of the strengths from other books in the series."
2,Hmmmm.,"I think it's wonderful that Ms. Langston has begun to evaluate some of the causes of deforestation in the western U.S. The forest service has certainly been careless and haphazard in its management of our forests. Insect infestation and diseases have undoubtedly ravaged our forests. Conspicuously undercovered in Ms. Langston's book, though, is the damage caused by unselective logging. Any honest (and I'm not trying to suggest that Ms. Langston is deliberately dishonest) tree biologist will tell you that logging, more than any other manmade activity, has had the severest impact on our wilderness."
2,misleading color,So disappointed to receive a purple watch when I thought I was getting a pink watch. The photo makes the watch look pink(magenta). I don't think of magenta as being part of the purple family. The watch-aside from the color-was great. Wish I could have kept it....We will see how well the return process goes...Zodiac makes a wonderful product.
3,Suede Dandruff,The Suede will come off and get on your clothes. It's a nice strap and the suede is soft. I have worked it hard to get the suede pieces off but they keep coming.
2,"""It's-Our-Book-Club"" review","Of the 7 members of our book club that tried to read ""Puff"", only 4 managed to get through it. Those that read it say it's just okay. The general consensus is that this book wasn't worth all the hype it got for being funny. It just wasn't that entertaining.It's just our humble opinion.-Members of It's-Our-Book-Club"
5,Great Customer Service!,"I bought this book for one of my MIT classes. I ordered it when we were two weeks into the class and was so excited that I found a text book for such a low price in almost new condition (hardcover). Unfortunately five weeks into the course I still had not received my book. I sent an email to the seller expressing my concern about how I still had not gotten my book and that I really needed it for school. The next day I not only received my book but I had gotten an email from the seller saying that they would refund me for my book.It surprised me and I gotta say the next time I need a book for a class I will make sure to check with them to see if they have it. The fact that they responded to my email in such a short amount of time, refunded me for my book, and that within 24 hours of contacting them I received my book was amazing! You simply do not find that kind of customer service anymore."
2,"Poorly organized, boring, decent content","I'm an IT professor and have used this book to teach a previous class a year or so ago. While the contents provide a sufficient overview of the IT function and case studies for grad-level students, it is unfortunately very dry stuff for most students. It is also poorly organized.Having used other textbooks for undergrads, this book fails in comparison. What my (and presumably all) business students are looking for are more immediately actionable knowledge, practical skills, and a much more compelling presentation. (The Technology in Action series is outstanding in all these respects!)Hopefully, the Laudons will 'sexify' their new textbooks with more flash and interesting content. If Apple, Nokia, Sony, Google, and other firms can make tech ultra-cool, I don't see why we can't have IT textbooks to match them."
2,NUMBER 4?,The film was too choppy and made you feel like you were on a small boat. Almost like Rocky over done.
4,good scary movie,The movie was dull at points but scary enough to really enjoy the movie. Maybe not as good as the 3rd movie but close. A lot better then the 2nd movie.
1,Don't waste time in your day watching this,"Wow.... All I can say is that I am so sad that I used two hours of my life to watch this movie. I LOVE scary movies - all sorts - and I've enjoyed this series. But this latest addition is just plain terrible. It wasn't scary, it wasn't startling, it wasn't interesting. It was just really bad. Wow.... I wish they had stopped at #3."
1,Really poor,"This was the least scary movie I've ever seen. High Schoolers could have put on a play that would equal the performances. It was part paranormal and part witch coven with northing else thrown in. It was disjointed, poorly written and a waste of valuable time. No reason given for anything. You could go into a coma watching it. I believe it was suppose to build to a climatic ending. But there were so many loose ends that nothing made sense."
1,Who Cares ? Unrated or Not !,"This movie is awful ! In fact, the whole series is awful .. now that I think of it. These movies are boring, a total hype-up with no actual deliverance, and a waste of time and money. This movie goes to show that there will not be a Paranormal Activity 5 .. and if there is, it will be a total flop !"
3,Paranormal 4....,"I've liked the series. Even though it kinda flip flops around. Still some good scares. So if you've liked the rest, you'll like this too."
2,Was not as good,"the first three where scarier then this on, was very disappointed this movie could have been better dont recommend it at all"
2,Bummer.....,I was surprised and sad about this movie! I was really hoping that this would be a more in depth movie than the last one. This movie did not answer questions about the cult or the demon possession or almost anything else. There were so many chances for plot development that were not even taken advantage of by the movie makers. This would have been better had they developed the relationships of the characters more. I was surprised that they did not.
1,Arguably the worst movie i've seen in a while.,"Horrible entry. I was never scared one bit, even though I'm rather jumpy. The worst part is the ending. I wondered the whole time when some sort of climactic scene was coming. The 8 year old I watched this with found it more humorous than horror. I would not recommend this movie."
2,Tedious,"I loved Paranormal Activity and Paranormal Activity 2, and 3 was entertaining and had its creepy moments. This fourth movie, however, was just tedious and I found myself looking at my watch. It wasn't scary and it lacked all the elements of surprise that this series has used in the past. Not worth watching really, and I thought it was kind of stupid."
1,Dreadful,This movie was so awful. It just really disappointed me & the boyfriend angle was boring. Not as good as the earlier films.
3,need to develop the story line better...,"They used many of the old tricks from PA#2 and PA#3. You can expect the peak of the movie, no more surprises."
3,it was ok,I was a little disappointed but it wasnt that bad. I was hoping it would be more intense and not so predictable.
2,Not as good as the others,"I have seen all the Paranormal Activity movies and this movie isn't as good as the other at all. This one never scared me one bit. I just liked the girl in the movie. She very cute, but everything else I hated. The demon Toby isn't as much part of the movie as this one. It seems like he taking a back seat and letting others do the killings.I should had watched this movie I felt. I didn't even know it was coming out in the theaters until one day I saw a poster for it, while I was there for a different movie. There wasn't any marketing down for this movie and maybe it was because it wasn't close to being good. I remember seeing Paranormal Activity 3 commercial everyday until it finally showed in the theaters, they kept on showing the commercial afterwards. But tfor the 4th one, I don't even remember seeing a single commercial for it!Everyone that actually liked the past PA movies, should stay faraway from this one...unless you like me and find the girl in the movie cute. lol"
2,A Waste of Time,"I thought number three was bad,number 4 just topped it.They should have stopped after 2,one and two were worth watching,the others are not.Three had a poor story line,they didn't even bother with one in four.Just a hodge podge of""strange events"" thrown in for shock value.Very disapointing."
1,awful.!,It was just something to watch and it was the worst out of all of them. So think twice about ordering.
2,Oye,"Not the most painful movie I've ever endured, but by far the worst of the Paranormal Activity movies. If you're familiar with these films, then you've come to expect the slow build-up to action until, at some point, all hell breaks loose. The hell-breaking point in #4 is a LONG time coming. In fact, I'm not sure it ever arrives. All of a sudden people are dying, and then it's just over, and my boyfriend and I looked at one another and went, ""Oye."""
2,Should have stopped at Trilogy,"I really like the PA Trilogy, especially 1 and 3.This one...not so much.It provided zero substance to the ongoing story and it wasn't even scary.At some parts, I was hoping that someone would get killed in the movie.Another very distracting thing was the teenagers.It may be just me getting old but the teens cursed waaaay to much, to the point that it was a distraction in the movie.By now we know the formula, night falls, scary low frequency sound, and then a boom (sometimes followed by a s scream).If I were you, I would stop with 3....I wish I did."
1,Always so predictable but weakest one of the series,I feel like the first paranormal activity thru the third where ok movies but i feel like each time they could have pushed harder to make it scarier. The ideas and opportunity are there but the seem to fall short sometimes on the scare factor. They need to make it more believable and not so hollywood. they need to understand people get scared when you show them something that could happen in their everyday life. If they do come out with a fifth to the series i hope that they will redeem themselves. One last thing i felt that the time in between scares was too long.
3,Too much like the others,"It has its funny moments, unlike the others in the series, but everything else was too much like the others. Doors opening without contact, children that don't talk when spoken to, moving toys, etc. I might have jumped once. But other than that, that's about it! It's a decent film."
3,Its funny to me,"I saw the first 3 and they just got less and less scary as time went on. This one here uses ""cheap scares"" to scare you and its tiring. I found this movie kind of funny though. Not that its a funny movie because its not but looking at the first 3 its plainly obvious that they are running out of material. Nevertheless, I still like the series and if they come out with part 5 (which i'm sure they will), I will wait, like I did with the other 3, for it to come on Amazon instant video."
2,paranormal dissappointment 4,"this version just dragged on an on till the end and the only good part about the end was it was overi want the people resonsible for this to give me a refund,was big fan of the series and couldnt wait to see 4 and nowi wish i wasnt in such a hurry"
3,"A few scary moments, otherwise: Meh.","Even though ""found footage"" movies are supposed to be light on plot, this one is *too* plot-less. It's slow-moving. And unless you've seen the previous Paranormal Activity movies, you'll be totally flumoxed by the ending. Not recommended."
3,#4 comes in 4th,"This movie was a letdown compared to films 1, 2 and 3. Still entertaining and worth the rent. But I have to sa I was surprised by th I was surprised by the ending and didn't much care for i it"
3,not as good as the others,"I was really looking forward to this coming out, I was a bit disappointed with how the movie ran. Yes there are some edgy moments, but not like the others. Judge for yourself but be ready for suspense LET DOWN."
1,makes no sense.....,I've been a fan of series but this movie is a complete waste of money....The lack of plot and unexplained moments is stunning.
3,Too Many Unanswered Questions,"Who the hell is Robbie?If Wyatt(Hunter) was adopted, how did the demon lose him in the first place?Why didnt the teens check the footage after the really crazy stuff started happening?Was Alex supposed to be the virgin mentioned earlier in the movie?WTF is up with the ending?"
2,Worst yet...,"Not horrible, but definitely the worst of the series yet. In order of quality: 2, 1, 3, 4. Hopefully 5 will be better."
2,not as great as the first three!,"I watched the first three movies and they were scary, this one didn't seem to connect to the other three and it didn't have any real surprises. It was too predictable...PARANORMAL yes, not enough ACTIVITY though! Watch is movie only if you are truly curious...?"
1,Starts out slow...,"Starts out slow and the best part is at the end, but sadly not as great as previous. Don't waste your money."
4,Good Movie,Good Movie. My teenage sons and I really enjoyed it and look forward to the next one. The way that it ended let us know there will be a #5.
2,Paranormal Activity 4,"As a huge fan of the series, I had high hopes for this Paranormal Activity 4. Instead, it was a lackluster film that didn't make much sense. The best scenes were at the end of the movie and were about half a second long, literally. I loved Paranormal Activity 1, 2, and 3, but I couldn't find one thing that I liked in this movie. It just bored me to death and moved along at a snail's pace. If you're not really into the series, I'd skip this one and just read a summary on-line because it's truly a waste of time."
1,Big disappointment.,"The first three films in this franchise were very enjoyable, but this entry was awful. Obvious cash in that delivers nothing new at all. Doubt I'll be returning for a 5th entry after this letdown. Avoid."
1,This movie was terrible,The worst movie I've ever seen. Was beyond stupid and really should stop putting movies like this out. Terrible movie
1,hope its the last,this movie was lame. i hope its the last one that is made under the paranormal activity name. any attempt to make another should be shut down befor it starts. that would be smart activity
2,retreaded crap,An old idea already. Try something different. Even the predictable was boring. They're tking the money and runningsave your money
1,Just Horrible!,"I was one of the few hold outs on Paranormal Activity. I enjoyed all three of the first films even though some people though it was getting dumber by the second. I was very intrigued by the story line. Though I appreciate knowing what happen to Katie and Hunter, this story left a lot to be desired. Just was not that Impressed."
1,Boring,"I loved the first three Paranormal Activity movies and was excited to see this one. However, I was bored senseless and promptly sold it on eBay to recoup some of my loss. I honestly think while the original idea in this franchise was great, the third movie should have been the last. Everything was kind of tied up in a neat little, scary bow. This one just sucked the life right out of the room. My husband fell asleep and I didn't even yell at him because I felt his pain."
1,"Horrible, Don't waste your money","I thought 1,2,3 where great #4 is an absolute joke. Movie drug on and on and on and on. I'm sending this one back. I would'nt spend $4.00 to rent it, little own $16.00 to own it."
1,LAME,There was nothing scary about this movie. There were so many missed opportunities to scare. I liked the other movies but I feel like this one was a complete waste of my time. Such a shame.
3,SCARY,WOW THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY I DONT KNOW IF I WOULD GO SEE IT AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO BUY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4: UNRATED EDITION (DVD) GO TO AMAZON.COM
3,Good Series,The Paranormal series story line actually continues more plot & affects driven in the 4th installment. Unfortunately the jumpscares are too predictable not really by any fault of the filmamakers other than its the 4th movie in the series and the filmography is predictable as a result.
1,The weakest of the series,"Not the least bit scaring, the weakest of the entire branch. I'd like very much to know how anyone can get scared by this dumb movie. I don't recommend it."
3,Ehh,"A solid horror flick, but it doesn't live up to it's predecessors. It was a good continuation of the story, but the ""scary"" elements were a bit lacking."
3,Paranormal act 4,The second one was the best but this one took a longer time to get to the scary parts but overall it was cool
2,Weak Entry,Very weak entry it seems like the series is starting to wind up on the quality like all horror movies are doing now.paranormal activity 1 and 2 were by far my favorites the third one was ok not as scary but still held its ownthis one is a very teen based film which is by far not always a bad thing but the roles i didn't feel the need to care about and the boyfriend role was annoyingand i heard a fifth entry will be coming out... no comment but i hope it's better than this one!
1,Paranormal Activity 4,"Worst one ever. For a scary movie, it did not make us jump at all. Overall there was not a very good plot line. Had to force myself to stay interested in it."
3,A couple of scares & that's it,"These movies seem to be getting less and less scary, this ones just lots of boring crap, the odd little freaky thing, that no one sees, a couple of good jump scary moments, then an ending that is just blah, like they had no idea what to do and just decided let's just .... Can't say it without ruining it (hah) for those yet to watch, but lets say there is little to ruin. Why can't someone make a good SCARY ghost movie ? All this over commercialized garbage trying to appease everyone, is not appeasing us hard cored horror fans :( sheesh I'd even write a script !"
2,Video stream is horrible even with broadband connection,After watching the movie for about five minutes it would pause and I have to buffer the video then it would play for about five minutes and then buffer for another five minutes we ended up giving up after about 30 minutes of this. We use a 40 megabit internet service provider... Amazon really needs to work on their servers to stream video properly. This isn't the first time this is happened I've had it happen on about three other movies as well I am done trying.
2,paranormal 3?,"this movie literally had the identical plot as PA3. and i don't mean the same theme (as all the PA movies will obvi have the same general theme), i mean the exact same plot. they're clearly no longer trying to put out a quality product; only cashing in the success of the first movie."
3,same as the rest,same as the other ones. not really scary. made me giggle. overall it was OK. that is all. thank you
2,The Weakest Entry Yet,"Paranormal Activity has become the ""Police Academy"" of horror films, with a sequel each year targeted at a particular type of audience, with a similar plot and familiar characters each time out. This year, the pickings are very slim, as this is by far the worst film of the four. Scares are few and far between, the acting is terrible, and the film is ALMOST IDENTICAL to Paranormal Activity 2, with the same exact ending as Paranormal 3.With a budget this big and a devoted audience, it is an insult to the integrity and to the intelligence of the loyal fans to put out a lackluster film such as this. They have obviously run out of ideas and are already rehashing the same scenes over and over again. Unless you are a huge fan of the franchise, don't seethis film. Not only are the first three better, but they are almost identical."
2,Not that bad...,But still not that good.For me this franchise died with part 3.A lot of people are complaining that part 4 doesn't make sense.I read the whole plot on Wiki so I guess the movie made more sense story wise.But still...they're continuing on with the story that was set in part 3 so needless to say...I wasn't impressed.Recommended rental for diehards only.
2,Paranormal Boredom,"I think the industry has taken this too far or ""heaven forbid"", I'm too old for the same thing over and over. Please come up with something new or change story lines ever so often for writers. The script writers may new to rotate every couple of months to keep their brain cells alive."
1,Its good but ending sucks.,I wish they could just beat the ghost and make at least one good happy ending or at least let someone live that's not evil.
3,Same old same....,Just OK.....a few well placed scares that made me jump. A creepy kid. I wish I would have Red Boxed it....would have been cheaper. Better than the second one. This is becoming a bad habit I can't seen to break!
5,Good Product,i liked it can not wait until the next one come out. it was scary. i had no problems with the dvd
2,The camera is never dropped,"This movie was bad for soo many reasons. Reason 1. The makers tipped their hand becuase everytime somone is going to die, the camera focuses directly on the person in the frame, blocking out the background. When the background is obscured you can't see what is happening behind the person on film, when suddenly they turn around the killer is there waiting to make a quick end of them. And it seems weird that while some characters are running in fear they never drop the camera. If I were being chased by an evil entity the camera is the last thing I'm running with."
1,Hated it!,This is the worst one out of the whole lot. It was looking really good until the end and it totally sucked guys. Save your money
4,Good,"There are lots of dumb horror fans calling this bad because it didn't have lots of ""scary scenes"" and that's exactly the type of moron feedback that ruins movies.If this movie consisted of many ""scary moments"" then it would be as badly one sided as the rest of these horror films out now. It has a nice amount of scares.This film helps connect the dots with the previous releases and if you are actually a smart enough movie-goer not afraid to use your brain to put the whole story together you will enjoy this! It isn't the franchise's best but most certainly not terrible either. Hopefully everyone was smart enough to watch till end credits to see extra footage which is said to be a set up for a latin spin-off and there is also pa5 on the way. So to all those giving this lower rating you're an idiot this is a good movie. In my opinion the best is between 2 and 3. Let's all hope the next releases are better though."
2,Finally the final chapter,"Be for warned this is a cash-cow movie. This time I didn't go off the expectations from the trailer like PA3.(Which I think is false ads) And as I predicted it wasn't anything compared to the trailer. First off the way the story goes absolutely no sense and false pretense from the original again. But there is good news, it ended the story with the characters but after the credits there is a spinoff ending video of another story that is probably going to be the next 4 mess ups."
3,They REALLY could have done a better job !,"I am a fan of this particular series. You have to keep in mind that It IS what it is. A low budget horror movie. You can't expect Academy award material. Para Norm Act 4 is probably meant to scare high school kids. I thought I was watching a Goosebumps type film. I thought Para Norm Act 3 was better as far as scary goes. I am not saying don't watch it, just dont expect anymore than what it is. Cheese! It has some creepy parts that are associated with the series as far as the story line goes. There are a couple jump moments, but it could have been done better."
1,Para-DULL activity,Hang it up. These sequels get more dull with each installment. I was hoping for a surprise hit. So much for hope!
2,Extremely dissappointed,Very poor ending to a good franchise. Whoever wrote this one should be ashamed. I could have written a better ending to these movies in my sleep.
1,Did not deliver at all.,"Don't waste your time watching this they aren't even making this series make sense anymore. They had success early on, but now they are just doing anything and everything to try and keep it alive. This franchise is getting stale and the only way I see them saving it is if they wrap it all up in the next movie and really delivery on the fear and suspense factor."
2,Not Quite what I expected.,"Compared to the other movies, this one started with the same kind of situation and family environment. Then it was just to predictable with no real surprise at all revealed. We knew everything already."
2,Don't waste your time,"Some movies should just give up after part 2 and this is one of them. Although the ending was a shocker, It wasn't worth sitting through the rest of it."
3,Not that scary; rather predictable; kids are good though,"This one is not nearly as scary as the first and is quite predictable with too much info given away too early; however, the younger actors are quite good and convincingly creepy as they are used by demonic forces."
2,Couldn't suspend disbelief,"The first two in the series were well done. PA 1 and PA 2 were occuring at approximately the same time, so it was a good reconciliation of the chain of events as we experienced them. PA 3 offered more of the backstory as to why these events were happening. PA 4 is tied to that backstory.My biggest issue with PA 4 is that, where the first couple of movies offered a reasonable and believable cause for the remote cameras and coverage, this was more of a stretch. It involves the teenage daughter and her tech savvy boyfriend networking the electronics in the home to offer 24/7 coverage, plus carrying their laptops or camera everywhere with them to capture events outside of the house. It was ridiculous. Even in moments of extreme duress, they always had the camera recording.There were some good effects, my favorite being the scenes involving the XBox Kinect data points."
4,The Middle Years,"Sometimes plodding, like ""Sometimes"" and sometimes too long, like ""Future Games"", but I like it just the same. ""Lay it All Down"" should have been left off for sure, and I think they had to put this one out before they were ready.Christine's ""Show Me A Smile"" should have been the title cut or Danny Kirwan's ""Sands of Time"". (Bob Welch was the new guy and he improves on F-Mac releases.)I'm glad I bought this CD, though. It shows the transition from the older band to the mid-cycle lineup. I wish Mick and John could round up all of the band members (up to and including Christine) for a tour! Hint!"
4,Thank you Danny,"No one knew what to expect in 1971 from the new lineupof fleetwood mac. Peter Green was gone as was jeremy spencer.The mood on this album is much softer then the previousalbums, but most of the songs are excellent. Christine Mcvie'sshow me a smile is a beautiful song. Bob Welch's future gamesblends jazz and rock very well. Danny Kirwan's woman of 1000years and sands of time are classics. 2 of the best songs fmever recorded. This album is very good. BUY IT."
2,"dismal sequel to ""Kiln House""","Anyone expecting to hear echoes of 1970's ""Kiln House"" will find this folk pop follow-up disappointing. It's not a matter of musical talent, although Mick Fleetwood's drumming is in the Buddy Miles mode--the chords aren't that interesting, and the vocals are frequently buried in the mix. Fans of Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"" period will welcome the addition of Christine McVie.It's not a terrible album, but it's not a good album."
2,Not so hot.,"I am a avid FM fan, and honestly, I can't listen to this album. I love the Pete Green Era, and the Lindsey/Stevie era. But this doesn't even stack up to Bare trees. Likely the least listened too album in my FM collection."
4,Sublime Kirwan!,"FUTURE GAMES is the CD I put on to get mellow and just drift. Kirwan's ""Woman of 1000 Years"" is ethereal, as is his ""Sands of Time."" Christine McVie never sounded better than she did on ""Show Me a Smile."" At first I thought Bob Welch's songs were jarring and didn't fit, but I guess I've grown accustomed to them, because I don't skip them any more, and I even sing along with them. I just wish there were more than eight songs on this CD."
4,Very Impressive Effort!,"Those who thought Fleetwood Mac were finished were mistaken after the release of this gem of a recording. Danny Kirwan simply shines on this album. ""Sands of Time"", ""Sometimes"" and ""Woman of 1000 years"" are fresh melodic songs that showcase his true talents with guitar harmonies. Bob Welch's title cut is a very impressive debut and is one of his strongest songs in the band. There is a moodiness to the album that is like nothing they have done since( with the exception of ""Bare Trees""). I recommend this album very much and feel that it , along with ""Bare Trees"", is the best post Peter Green/pre Buckingham work the band has done."
1,Essentially not a very good book.,"Author cannot make up his mind as to whether he wanted to write atechnical reference book for modems or an introductory book for ""dummies."" Sometimes the text is written as if it is a non-reference book, but the equations and figures come up without enough explanation, so it assumes that you know the subject well. If you are looking for a solid technical reference on modems, this isn't it. The figures are over-simplified so much as to be sometimes hard to understand.Only reason to buy it is because there are no other reference books on the subject. It is certainly way over-priced."
2,Married with children DVD,"Once again companies refuse to understand that best of dvd's are pointless. While they capture a variety of episodes from varies seasons, a true fan would much rather have a complete season that is organized and packaged well. I would not recommend buying this because of the fact that shows like Friends did the same thing and came out with best of dvd's and then followed that with complete seasons. The clock is ticking though for tv shows to appear on dvd and before too long the TV powerhouses will come out(FRESH PRINCE, SEINFELD, Home Improvement, and Roseanne)"
2,Don't Blame FOX It is Columbia Tri-Star...,"First of all FOX is the best in DVD Production from the X-files,Simpsons,Malcolm in the middle, 24 to the movies Fight club,X-men.and so on..Though the show ran on FOX Network. The Tv show is propertey of Columbia Tri-Star So hating FOX won't accomplish anything.Instead Hound columbia tri-star.Though Dissapointing, I will still buy anything Married with children. I love this show."
3,Not the best episodes,"What's so ""outrageous"" about these select episodes? There are far more that are better. The studio audience REALLY gets on my nerves. What is this, audience participation? And what's with the stupid way the women tilt and shake their head after every time they deliver a small put-down? This show was a lot funnier back when I was 17 & 18. Now that I'm older it just seems kind of lame."
3,another dissapointment from our enemys at fox...,"Why is it that studios today are releasing every tv show's entire first season??? I even saw that ""Evening Shade"" was being released... But when it comes to my favorite show ""Married with Children"", the piecemeal it out in these little ... 5 or 6 episode bits... What an insult.I still gave it 3 stars because I do enjoy Al and the gang. It didn't get 5 because I just hate FOX so much for doing this to us."
3,Finally.........but still a disappointment,finally someone has come out with these shows to the public. they have been non-existant for too long. They need to come out with more of the best episodes and put more than just five on a disc. If you like the Bundys then these are good
4,Really good for what it is,"I wasnt too impressed with volume 1, but this set is definitely better. When i say better, i am just talking about the episodes chosen, because this release is basically identical to the first release on everything else. Same Sinatra Salute. Same trailers. Same everything.But anyway. Dont expect much from this disk. It is what it is; five (probably random) Married with Children episodes. Of the five episodes, three of them are great with the other 2 just being mediocre.Even after all these years, i still don't understand how they got away with some of their material on TV. It could still be considered ""Outrageous"" even by todays standards.I just can't wait until season sets start appearing."
2,Oy,"This seems like a fun idea for you and your dog, but in reality it doesn't work. My dog was bored with it in about two seconds, and doing it without treats only confused him."
2,"Love most ""Pet Stages"" products; this one was Okay","My dog (a 4 lb yorkie) didn't really ""get"" this toy. I taught her to pick up the bells by the handle, but she never caught on to guess where the ball is.... She much more prefers squeaky toys and playing catch and tug-of-war. Cute idea, just not sure how many dogs really would like it. (I'm happy for those who have a dog that does, though. :)"
5,Please remember why you are waving the flag.,There is so much more left out of the film but this is a great start to someone knowing there is something wrong but just can't put a finger on it.Thank you to everyone who is trying to get the word out. So many people will not listen to the common man or woman.Many believe waving the flag was enough for freedom THIS IS NOT TRUE. If this offends you then go back to sleep!
5,Behold a Pale Horse,"Behold a Pale Horse is a much needed film for the world we live in today. The loss of freedom is rampant, but hardly noticed by many Americans. The style of the film is not my favorite, I wish the interviews had not been as seperated, and allowed to make a complete point before going to the next person's interview. But with that said, the film still rates my full support. Agenda 21 is in my view, maybe the greatest threat to America, and to our American way of life. This movie will expose and explain what it is, and how it is effecting you and your family at this very moment. This film is not for everyone, but for the ""aware"" who know something is wrong, and sense how quickly your country is changing, this film was made for you."
2,A bit simplistic,"While some of the information about things like Agenda 21 and electronic tracking was interesting (though scarcely verified - I'd want to see more evidence than was presented here), the tone of this movie was weird (what was up with the Charlie Daniels ""the land I grew up in"" monologues?), and the pacing and flipping back-and-forth made it difficult to follow the central point of the film."
5,Concerned Citizen,"This movie is definitely something to think about. Very patriotic and appealing.The question is are we too late. Our inaction and popularized ignorance perpetrated by the mainstream media has caused ""change"" to be shoved down our throats.One wonders if this fight is already lost."
5,a gem,"This is one of the most wonderful compilations of vintage recordings. Some of the selections sounds like an old LP record but gives it a nostalgic feel. As a big fan of Miguel Aceves Mejia and Jose Alfredo Jimenez, who has some songs here, I found the other selections by Francisco Charro Avitia, Gilberto Valenzuela, Jorge Negrete and Lucha Villa equally wonderful. For the price, you get two CDs and a short history on the cover, this a great buy, and the songs are really great. Anyone who loves Mexican music will surely enjoy this."
1,Forget this book if you want hard information,"The book is mostly the results of a survey of people who have established foundations; about their knowledge, motivations, etc. It has very, very little hard information for someone who is considering setting up a foundation. For that purpose the book is a waste of time and money. It is little more than a puff (marketing) piece for the authors who would love to help you set up your foundation."
3,Good performance at a good price,"The tape works OK.The only thing I would note is that this tape feels a little stiff and you need to make sure to press it firmly against boxes or whatever you're sealing. By that, I mean that the tape feels like it's not very sticky. I've used other tape guns with different tape that is more sticky and flexible, but I don't remember the brand... I might post it if I remember.Anyway, this tape works just fine. I might be splitting hairs by saying other tape is more sticky, because I've sent several packages using this tape and never had a problem.I would probably buy it again, but if you will need a lot of tape, you might want to test a roll to see how you like it before buying dozens of rolls that you don't like."
4,Pretty Good tape for packaging,"I sell a lot of things on Ebay and I need a large and cheap quantity of tape to last me. This did excellently for all my needs and clings very cleanly against most services.For the price it has an excellent amount and should last me quite a bit.The item is now an add-on item and is a great pickup,I'll make sure to pick up a lot more."
4,Crudely Charming,"The Semi-Complete Guide to Sort of Being a Gentleman is a spoof of Emily Post's etiquette guide. This wry and witty book on the ""necessary"" steps a man is required to take in order to become a gentleman...sort of. It will indeed make you laugh. The author, Brock LaBorde puts together 146 pages of hilarious and absurd, yet straightforward, examples on how today's modern man should behave in society and the even funnier reasoning on why he should behave as such.""Arguing is not an option for gentlemen. If any person has an opinion about something, a gentleman faithfully accepts that person's opinion as his own truth. This is why the world is both round and flat.""A real gentleman will have this book in his collection of coffee table books as a great conversation piece, as it will prove that he possesses supreme intelligence and class. Any lady who possesses this book, will be able use it as a guide to spot just such a gentleman.4/5"
1,The Semi-Complete Guise to Sort of Being a Gentleman,Terrible book that must have been written as a poor joke. Amazon and every similar retailer should remove this book from the shelves. It does not even rank one star although this review could not be provided without a minimum one star ranking.
5,Still Outstanding,"That says it all. I've owned this one since it was born, and every time I lose it or kids BREAK the CD I replace it. It truly does stand the test of time and there's nothing trite or redundant about the tracks. They're wonderful from start to finish.David outdoes himself."
5,Straight From The Heart!,"Wheather the tune be mellow or funky to the hilt David Sanborn always gives the music his all!And there are plenty ofexamples of fine funk jazz to be found on 'As We Speak'.""Rush Hour"" and ""Back Again"" both groove hard and fit solidly into thatcatagory while the opening ""Port Of Call"" takes a mellower trip down a similar path,highlited by Geogre Duke's steller solo on his patented castlebar clavinet!From cut one to cut nine thisalbum sparkles with joy and brilliant musicianship!"
5,a nostalgic and good album of the eighties,"this album was in form in top of the jazz charts of the eighties, port of call is a melody well balanced with excellent arrangements and with participation of George Duke, Omar Hakim, Michael Sembello, Marcus Miller, Paulinho Da Costa, I heard one version of port of call in a Sergio Mendes album also with a participation of Mr. Sembello, a high recommended album for Contemporary Jazz music lovers and David fans, at last on cd."
5,Sensible,"I would repeat my comments from my review of Iona Brown's recording of the Haffner Symphony and Haffner Serenade, both of which come from the same recording sessions in April 1997 as the works on this CD. The 33rd Symphony is a tricky work to bring off. Brown takes some galoping tempos in the first movement that really usher in a great commotion. The string playing is fully up to her demands, really virtuosic in its tonal beauty and its ease of execution. Brown sustains this momentum throughout the Symphony, a truly memorable reading. The Serenade is all grace and polish. This is one of the hardest of Mozart's serenades to bring off. George Szell failed horribly. But Brown's reading is sensibly paced and offers many opportunites for the first chairs to shine. The Posthorn soloist is uncredited (It might be the principal trumpet, who is credited.), but his playing is ringing in tone and brilliant. This disc is a prime feature of the legacy of Iona Brown."
1,"Bob Larson at his overstating, alarmist best!","What Bob Larsen knows about Satan could be learned by anyone with a subscription to National Enquirer and a memory of TV's ""Outer Limits."" No doubt, he has spoken about Satanism a great deal, but, as Milli Vanilli proved: paying customers don't make the performer real."
3,Adequate,"Package took 9 days to arrive via UPS standard shipping. Nice ebony finish, case locks(no need) but hinges are cheap and appear to be held on by nails. Wish that I had gotten the Tech Swiss 10 watch case below. I also purchased the Tech Swiss 6 watch case for my wife and wish I had the lager version for myself.Watch Storage Chest For 10 Watches Burlwood Finish"
2,Dissappointing,"I reviewd this under the PC version of the full-lown Hoyle Casino, so what I said there applies here. Maybe it's me, but I have a hard time with this game, mainly because I can't make out the cards, and the symbols are hard to read. Roullette and craps are the biggest hassles, due to panning over the boards. Black Jack isn't bad, but reading the menues are impossible. I keep making plays that I would know better not to.As bad as this is, the Holye Card game for the Game Boy is worse.Lots of variety, but no playability. Maybe I'm spoiled by a 17-inch monitor on my PC.Again, save your money..."
2,BEWARE,Extremely dissappointed. The pc version is so great that I wanted a more portable version. Graphics are difficult to see and there are no 350 variations. Very boring and no fun!
5,RUSTY WALLACE TRAVEL MUG,THIS MUG IS HEAVY DUTY STAINLESS STEEL. IT HAS A BEAUTIFUL DESIGN. A PERFECT ADDITION FOR ANY RUSTY WALLACE FAN
2,mediocrity,"kinda the worst awful west coast caterin to THE EAST COAST bore wat past post punk PRIME before the ultimate bore FOR A FEW YEARS SETTLED IN, THIS IS LABORIOUS,impossible to listen to three times in a row,ONE OF THOSE AWFUL FINDS that doesnt reward repeated OR carefull LISTENINGS, is THERE one good tune?

1,Expected More For The Price,"I replaced a cheaper blender with this more powerful bender because I do a ton of protein shakes every week. Within on 6 months, the plastic container couldn't old up! The description of this blender states that it is sold with a glass container, but that's simply not the case. You can't even get a class container as a replacement. Not happy with the additional price I paid for a blender that doesn't last as long as the other cheaper models. Will be looking for a new blender."
2,Not what I expected,"I think this product has a great motor perhaps, but I didn't like the way the top fit, plus I felt like I needed to keep my hand on the id. Maybe I was just cautious, but I returned it."
2,Lid doesn't fit...,The lid on this product doesn't fit the pitcher. I thought it was b/c the product was new and it had to be broken in but I've been using it and it's still too tight - I have to struggle to put the lid on. No other issues with the product but it's a bit annoying to struggle to palce the lid on everytime I try to use it.
1,PLASTIC JAR LASTED TWO (2) SMOOTHIES!,I was excited about this blender. Boy was I disappointed. A tiny flimsy plastic jar. The motor was fine but the jar lasted two uses and it cost $50.00 for a replacement. When I tried to buy a new jar there were non available. So I bought a complete new smoothie maker by back to basics with a large GLASS jar for just $70.00. I love my back to basis. I can't believe I paid over $300.00 for a piece of junk.
4,Mixing it up!,"To start with this blinder has some major power! Don't put it in the carafe if you don't want it mixed in. Speaking of the carafe I love that it's one solid unit so no taking it apart to wash. It is also super strong plastic. The entire look of the blender is a nice industrial feel to it. The only issue I have is that being that the motor is so strong you have to have one hand on it while running or the carafe will work it's way off the motor. I would prefer it to lock on some way so I can do another task. None the less it works well, looks good and I use it every day."
4,Mega Mix,"The Mega Mix was impossible to find in retail stores and it is the most powerful for heavy fruit smoothies and such. I wish it had a retractable cord to take up less counter space; also the base feet are never quite level causing it to teeter a litte. Despite those things, if you want the best blender for power and one you'll probably never throw out, this is it."
3,Jar Broke after 13 months,"Purchased this blender on October 29, 2011. On Nov 29, 2012, the part around the base of the blade broke and started leaking all over the place. I have used this blender almost daily for kale smoothies since I received it, and while it blended great, I am disappointed that the jar broke after only a year. Replacement jar is $40-50 online, and according to Waring there is no warranty on it at all..."
5,the blender of kings,"I've had mine for over a month and thus far it has performed flawlessly. It will digest an entire tray of large ice cubes in roughly 3 seconds on the ""low"" setting (not exaggerating). I haven't even used it on ""high"" yet. Classy looks, quality construction, but yes- extremely loud. I keep a pair of earplugs next to mine."
2,worked great until leaking started,"This product worked great and would blend anything until one day after only a couple months of use, it started leaking and when I called the manufacturer, they said I must have mis-used it!!!"
3,Needs Work,"The beginning of the book moved too quickly at times (which made the book unrealistic) and some things were unclear.However from the middle of the book on, it became suprisingly profound. If the beginning of the book had been better it would have desearved 4 or 5 stars.Having an eating disorder myself I was able to identify and be somewhat inspired by the main character. Overall I was to some degree disapointed (especially that the quality of the book didn't match the price when it cost $14.15), but enjoyed reading The Echo Glass."
3,Hey beware !,Pls be so kind reviewer of amazon . .this is not a greek album.Instead they are italian guys.. singing in greece only 'cause in italy they couldn't become famous as they want...
4,"Good Recorder, But No Cleaning Rod Included",These are good recorders. My school system ordered them for all the third graders in the city for the recorder program. My only disappointment is that they don't come with cleaning rods. You really need them once the recorder starts to 'fog up' inside when you have played it for a bit.
4,recorder,I was surprised how well this recorder sounded. I wish it came in more color choices. My daughter loves it and has several friends ask her where she purchased it.
1,Dont Bother,"when i got this, it seemed in condition until a week later, i realized that the last key didnt even give out a proper pitch, and it still had the last persons moisture in it, and it wasnt oil or grease"
4,Not bad for Unprofessional Recording,Not bad for a first time recording .. not much to do though but the sound quality is good
4,Solid Recorder at Great Price,"I am not a musician so the Yamaha YRS24B soprano recorder was perfect for me. It is sturdy and has held up well. The pitch seems fine--at least compared to other soprano recorders. The color is a little annoying but it does come in an excellent case. The price simply can not be beat. While I am not a musician by any means, I have enjoyed this recorder and recommend it based on the price. I think it will also do well for children based on the price and how sturdy it is."
1,not correct tones in fa and sol,I bought this for my son who will use it at school. This recorder does not have correct tones. Its fa and sol are completely off. I have to purchase another one but it won't be a Yamaha.
5,Love it!,"Hi,I want a flute but don't have enough money for that. So I bought this Yamaha Soprano Recorder to have an instrument to play while I can buy a flute. I did have one Soprano Recorder when I was on school, so I know how to play it. This is a good item. I love it."
5,Lovely flute!,"Since I came from Mexico, I I searched everywhere to get this recorder that I learned when I was in middle school. Now I can show and do some performances. Great sound! Thanks you very much."
5,An amazing piece,"This watch is extremely beautiful and elegant. The materials are of the very best best quality, both inside and outside. I have had it for about 4 months and even though I have not been careful with it it's completely scratch free. The watch is oval, the face measures approximately 2 x 1.3 in. There is absolutely nothing goth about it. If you like big handbags, high heels and accessories that make a statement, you will absolutely love it.Few months later - I still love it, people ask about what I am wearing, I would not sell it for the double of I what I have paid for it. I guess it's one of my favorite things."
2,"Huge, thick watch","My expectation was that this would be midsize unisex watch. Certainly, the photo suggests that this is a sleek, stylish, ""weekend dressy"" watch.Beware if you think the same: It certainly is anything but!I'm not petite at 5 feet 8 inches and 135 lbs, but this watch is clearly made for someone much bigger than I, and probably the opposite gender. It is HUGE...and I do mean HUGE on a more than average sized woman's arm.While the watch face appears to be circular on the photo, it is not...it is more of a large horizontal oval (if that makes sense) with enormous, highly stylized numbers.This watch might be most appropriate for someone in the creative fields or someone with more of a ""goth"" taste in jewelry."
4,Please update details!,"Good filter, but not made for long-term. Be advised, this is a 14-micron filter with 11/16 threads. It can handle 10 GPM flow. 14 micron won't catch ethanol issues in marine tanks."
5,Fagan's Solo Masterpiece,"I love this Album. Extremely polished performance, beautiful chord progressions, Jazz with a melody you can remember, lends itself well to late night listening.The only Steely Dan album that compares is Aja.I only wish he produced more, but I'd rather have quality than quantity.Joe"
5,Doesn't need to be remastered,"With regard to the sound quality of this cd, there are many out there who are concerned with such things that consider this one of the best sounding cds of all time. This album is an early 80's all digital recording that was released on cd in the early days of the format. In that sense it probably sounds exactly as it should. More and more information is coming out about the current state of audio mastering, about the ""loudness war,"" and the virtual elimination of dynamic range in modern day cd's. The Nightfly is an example of how cd's are suppose to sound. If it doesn't seem ""loud"" enough, try adjusting the volume on your stereo."
5,My favorite CD of all times,"Few CD's are such that you can listen to them over and over, year after year, and never tire of them. But I've been listening to ""Nightfly"" since the week it hit the stands and it has yet to fail to be uplifting and relaxing everytime it plays. And now it's my young daughter's favorite, too. ""New Frontier"" is our favorite cut, but it is great from beginning to end. Fagen definitely deserved a Grammy for this one!"
5,Simply amazing!,"There are already over 115 reviews of how great this album is, I just want to add one thing. Right now, there are 118 reviews for this CD, and 109 give 5 stars, and as for the other 9, 6 of them were four stars reviews, 2 have 2 stars, and only 1 has one star.The Beatles, Stones, Pink Floyd, The Who, and all the other master of music don't get reviews like this.Get this CD!"
5,"A question for you,","The Nightfly. As if you came here expecting to find a bad review. A few simple clicks is all it takes for you to be in posession of (even if not the absolute finest album of all time, then the second). Once you play this I believe that you'll find yourself hummin or singin it more times than you do all of your other music. Oh, I think I forgot to say how much I like this collection of songs. P.S. I thought I could do this in less than 20 words. Do not click away from here. Buy this album. Trust Me. Would I lie to you?"
5,A way in for non-jazzers,"I was fifteen when I first heard Steely Dan. A bass-playing friend of mine owned a copy of the Royal Scam and one of this album. Initially I thought the Nightfly sounded strange, when compared to the stuff that my friends were listening to, i.e. Nirvana. Maybe it was because it was from another era, I don't know, but something grabbed me deep inside and after a while I really got into it. At that time I was just starting to get into Jazz and I found the Nightfly with its close ties to Jazz, to be a good introduction to the genre. These days, I am a Jazz musician and am thankful for being able to hear this album. I also think in retrospect, a lot has to be said for the Nightfly, for it was popular with a number of people who didn't even like Jazz, yet didn't sacrifice quality for mere cross-over status. A great album up there with the best of 'em"
5,Another 5-star rating... Fagen's the real deal,"I bought this in 1982 and loved it immediately. What's not to like? Interesting stories; fabulous arrangements; top-notch musicianship; impeccable production. Worth it just for Maxine and New Frontier, but every song is a gem. Fagen is a national treasure. If 43 five-star ratings out of 45 isn't enough to make you buy this CD, perhaps 44 out of 46 will push you over the edge. Consider yourself pushed and enjoy the ride down. You will not regret it."
3,"Nice, smooth pop music and songwriting featured here","I really got into certain cuts on this album: ""Nightfly,"" ""I.G.Y."" and ""New Frontier."" Others dragged on, but the lyrics are on point. ""Kamikiriad"" is the album to have."
3,Where's The Barb?,"This isn't a a Steely Dan album, but it fits the Dan theory - the best ones have a slammin' beat! This album doesn't. It's pretty but slight in more ways than one - the nostalgic lyrics, the doo-wop harmonies. It's as if Fagan forgot he wrote the ironic ""Reelin' In the Years""! For staying power, the title track is the most all right, but for real Fagan pleasure I'd skip this album and go straight to Kamikyriad."
2,for limited tastes only,"I have to admit that I liked this LP when it first came out in '82, but I outgrew it. It just didn't ""age"" very well. There are still some things to like. New Frontier is the best song, and I enjoy the Lettermen-like vocal arrangements Fagan uses here and there. (Such harmonies are the same ones Brian Wilson grew up with; the ones that influenced his Beach Boys compositions) But Fagan's The Nightfly is like a wine cooler: thin and dated. It's okay as far is it goes (and that's not very far) but not satisfying for more sophisitcated tastes. If you must have beginner's jazz in your system, get Steely Dan's Aja instead. Better songs, tastier arrangements, better band leadership--it's simply a more rewarding collection of music."
5,Nightfly will always be a classic,"I first was given this album in 1982 by a boyfriend. I was always a huge Steely Dan fan, and listening to this album was as about as good as it got. When I listen to it now, twenty years later, it is easy to see how timeless each song is. You cannot help but have emotions stir up as you listen to it - yes, it is that powerful. The story behind each song is almost a tear-jerker, but you are too busy enjoying the music. I highly recomend this CD to anyone who was/is a Steely Dan fan and a lover of great jazz music."
5,The evaluation standard.,I use this album as standard for evaluating and adjusting other audio gear. The music has such depth and quality it can be used to calibrate to the highest standards.
5,"Don't blink, Buy !","Absolutely the best album in the Donald Fagen stable, from production through to mastering. Recorded on 32 channels at a time when the industry standard was 16 channels.I have it on vinyl and it sounds even better than my CD.Best appreciated on valve audio equipment.Play it to someone old before they die.Amen.THE MUSIC ROOM"
5,Classy Jazzamataz,"This is classy jazzy pop/rock with Fagen's signature flair. It is just as good as anything that Steely Dan ever put out. As a matter of fact, it is probably even catchier than the Dan's material. It leans more into pop territory than into rock as compared to Steely Dan. If you are familiar with them, you will find this is a softer continuation of their sound.This is supposedly a concept album. I didn't follow that. I just heard the music and fell in love with this album. Donald Fagen is a brilliant songwriter/piano player and vocalist. He is original and can hold his own with the best of the industry. There isn't a weak track in the bunch, and the only weakness is how short the album is by today's standards, coming in at only 8 songs. This is for adult, contemporary fans and fans of intelligent music in general.All of the songs are highlights."
5,Stands the test of time,"This is the finest Album Donald Fagan ever did.What amazes me is that it sounds so good and sounds so fresh it just makes me shake my head to think this recording is now 25 years old.Interestingly, when this album was recorded it was done Completely digital which was rare at the time. The only Analog was the mastering to Vinyl.So since it was digitally recorded it was no problem taking this to CD format. It sounds like it was always a CD.Recording and musical performances are all ""FAGAN FLAWLESS.""check this one out it really is the Desert Island CD. I listen to this in the car on the boat and at home. Never get tired of this. 25 years old? Impossible. 25 Years Young."
5,The Nightfly,"I love this album. I bought the vinyl when it came out in the mid 80s and getting a good mp3 of it tops the cake for me. The whole album has a jazzy feel to it. Donald uses some of the top studio musicians of the 80s then to help create a very cool sound. If you liked Steely Dan, you 'll love this. I also believe that this was digitally recorded back in the day too. I listen to this one over and over again."
5,"An excellent CD, first rate","I was looking for years for this CD. Actally there is a song on it ('Just machines that make big descisions'). I didn't know the actual name of the song, now I know (I.G.Y.). I'm glad it wasn't just a one song CD sensation. This is what a great sound system was made for."
3,BBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"""Not only are we going to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin, we're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico, and we're going to California and Texas and New York ... And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan. And then we're going to Washington, D.C., to take back the White House! Byaaah!!!"""
3,This Democrat found it Underwhelming,"IT has neither the length or depth to be a memoir nor the utility to be a manual for Democrats. Plus, Dean has gone pretty much wacko since writing it."
2,Authors Writing Style,"The book is a good starter for real beginners hence its title is apt. The writing style is very dry which is most likely the influence of Dobbins who's articles are generally dry, cynical and sometimes self promoting. Parkers reputation and expertise with planetary imaging certainly gives the book some value. If you're serious about solar system photography, there are many other better resources available though for the absolute beginner it may be worthwhile."
2,Introduction to observing and photographing the Solar syaytem.,The book is useful but parts need to be updated. Has some guide lines but I personally would search for a more moderen version ( up to date.)
2,Dog loved it. Not durable.,"I received a a Crazy Paw Puppet shaped as a squirrel instead of the pictured hippo. The item is not a real puppet which is what I initially wanted (similar to the bite-meez puppet toys) so I was a little disappointed as well. Either way, my Shiba Inu was delighted to play with the new toy. She was able to rip open a seam within 10 minutes of intense play. I would not buy this product again."
3,me,Product showed a rubber type bone toy on it but came with a tennis ball which broke apart within minutes of use. I selected it specifically because it had the bone and I suspected the balls wouldn't last and I was right. I kept it anyway.
1,Not too happy....,I ordered this product thinking that I was getting the item showed in the picture. Instead I received a leopard type puppet. I would think that if you order an item you should receive what is pictured. It wasn't stated in the description that it would be a random toy.I can still use the product but I would of preferred the green puppet. I would of rathered had the one listed because it isn't furry. Which one the main reason I selected this item to begin with. I will not order from this group again. :(
2,Jump Starter,I can't rate this thing very high because mine will only charge a portion of the way to full. I probably should have sent it back but didn't.I guess I kept it because I use it for an electric winch to pull my smoker into the back of my pickup and it will provide enough power to get the job done before crapping out.Follow-up:The thing finally crapped out completely I would buy a B&D; jump starter again but not this one.
1,Couldn't Jump a VW Golf,"The battery in my VW Golf tends to go dead because I don't get a chance to drive it much, so I bought this product with the hope that it would start it the next time it died. I charged it exactly as was stated in the manual and it still did not have enough juice to start my car. If it has this much trouble with a small Golf I don't imagine it would work much better with other cars.It could just be that I received a defective unit but in my experience, it couldn't get the job done."
2,compressor is weak,"purchased this about two yrs ago, never had to use it to jumpstart any car. But last month my wife had a flat tire, used the fix-a-flat stuff for a partial inflation repair, then tried using the compressor (was just charged the prior evening). Compressor ran at full bore for less then 10 seconds, then barely ran at all.recharged it again, while it was at full charge turned on compressor without any tire connected and same thing.if you want this as an all purpose unit, only depend on it as a power source but not as a emergency air compressor"
4,Priced too high,I bought this today from walmart for forty two dollars.... exact same thing... I got it incase my electricity goes off tomorrow during the expected ice storm... with the extra 100 watt B&D inverter bought seperately for less than twenty dollars I will be able to use my computer and charge my phone... pluse i can jump my pick up if I need to.
5,"Excellent value, compact- works as advertised","Lightweight and compact, easy to use to jump start the car- best value for the money"
2,Unsure of its quality,I purchased two of these items one for each of our family cars.During a recent battery drain I used the booster to jump start my car numerous times but was unsuccessful (although it had two full bars indicating ample power). I had thought my starter or alternator had gone bad but a tow truck with its booster was able to jump start me on one try.I am certain the tow truck had a more powerful booster but this unit was rated well but failed when I needed it to work. I have yet to check to see if the booster is faulty. The rest of the unit works well.
4,jump cable clips,Several people here have mentioned that the clips are made of cheap plastic. I'm happy to report that mine received march 2 2007 has all-metal clips that seem to be quite sturdy! They have definately updated the design.
4,VEC010BD Jump Starter,"I'm using this product to power a small electric trolling motor that I use as emergency power for my small inflatable sailboat. For that purpose, it is performing well -- giving me the 30 minute usage per unit that I thought it would. I would like a better indication of how much charge is left in the battery. The three lights (low, medium, high) are OK but not as accurate an indicator as I think a meter or more lights would have been. I like the 12V outlet to power accesories in the boat. I do not need the DC-to-DC charging option. Charge time has been good. Maybe this winter I'll keep a charged unit in my vehicle and actually use the unit for its intended purpose."
1,Not worth it!!,"I bought this product in hopes of jump starting my lawn tractor as well as a vehicle (if the need came up). Well, the need did come up... three times.... and this product was NOT able to give me enough power to successfully jump start my Explorer. It made the lights come on, and the 'open door' bell sound, but that was it. Right out of the box, I charged it by following the directions precisely. I truly feel like I've wasted my money!! Worse, I didn't find out how bad it was until it was already out of warranty."
1,Not worth the time and effort,"I received this jump-starter as a gift and it worked well for about 6 months then wouldn't hold a charge, which is slightly critical for a cordless, rechargeable jump-starter. I contacted Black and Decker to see if my unit was still under warranty but got the run-around from them and finally gave up. From the sounds of it and based up my experience with it, if you buy one or receive it as a gift, just call the number on the back to see where you can dispose of it immediately and end the misery of owning it sooner and than later."
5,Excellent Product,I have used this product to jump start my car like 7 - 8 times and it has worked really great !!! I would strongly recommend to buy this product if you are looking for a good jump starter !!!
2,Returned Twice but Amazon Customer Service was Great.,Both Units were defective as they could not charge 100% and all 3 green lights never lit even charging for over 3 days.Called the B and D customer support to confirm and was advised to get a refund on both units.Had to return both of them and Amazon customer service was great.
1,"Could have had 5 stars, gets 1","Fatally flawed. Magnificently compact, clever design, but broke first time I used it--el-cheapo plastic clamps snapped. Service center wouldn't repair it, so I had to return it. An otherwise beautiful design, with a frustrating Achilles heel. AARRGH!"
1,CHARGING WON'T HAPPEN,"THE FIRST TIME I USED IT, IT WAS EXCELLENT. THEN, AFTER ABOUT 2 MONTHS I ATTEMPTED TO CHARGE IT AGAIN. INSERTING THE SMALL CHARGER WIRE INTO THE SMALL HOLE AND PLUGGING THE CHARGING CORD INTO THE WALL SOCKET, THERE WAS SO RESPONSE. WIGGLING THE CORD AT THE UNIT PRODUCED THE RED CHARGING LIGHT BUT ONLY IF YOU HELD IT BY HAND JUST RIGHT. I PUT A SMALL WEIGHT ON TOP OF THE END TO KEEP IT CHARGING WITH THE RED LIGHT BUT THE FLASHING GREEN LIGHT INDICATING A FULL CHARGE NEVER CAME ON. VERY DISAPPOINTED....WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN."
4,Works fine but doesn't hold charge for long,"If you get this as an alternative to jump start cables, then do keep it plugged in as it won't hold peak charge for long. And it does need to be at or close to peak charge to jump start a car. It will power up other 12V accessories for quite a while, so no problems there.And yes, the variety of options on it (light, LEDs, etc) are nice and much more useful. Definitely better than the spare battery I used to have for such uses. The carry handle itself is a huge benefit."
1,Useless,"I had a similar item because I've always had a bad habit of leaving my lights on, and sometimes play the good Samaritan when I see someone who needs a jump. I forget the brand, but it lasted 5 years and was always ready when I needed it. I rarely had to re-charge the thing.When that one finally died, I purchased the Black & Decker Start It. I charged it up and a few months later when I needed it, the unit was was near dead and didn't have enough power to start my car. I foolishly purchased another for my wife's car because it was the only brand sold in that store. That one never accepts a full charge (the green light never comes on no matter how long it has been on the charger) and loses its charge just as quickly as the first one I bought.I find I have recharge both every month so they will be ready when I need them. If I forget, I'm out of luck.An emergency car starter that won't hold a charge is useless."
1,Worked once and not any more,I purchased this about 8 months ago and it worked once and would not hold a charge after that one use. I contacted the company and after several phone calls and phone tag I was told that without a receipt that the warrenty did not apply to the unit. Suggest looking at another brand and keep the receipt.
1,Worked great!...for a minute,"Got one in February of 08. Construction was solid enough. Used it four or five times in August-September. My truck had a bad cable. After the last time, it won't charge. Now totally worthless. Haven't decided if it's worth getting fixed under the warranty. I won't be buying another one of this brand."
1,Not enough power,"I have worked on cars for 40 years. I've tried to jump about a dozen cars so far with this product and it has failed to start any of them. The unit, at 300 instant amps and 225 continuous amps, is just not enough power. In each case, I had to break out my jumper cables to start the cars, using other vehicles. Look for a jump starter with at least 400 amps. I would not recommend this product to anyone. For me, it was a waste of money."
1,Save Your Money for a Tow Truck!,"I've used a lot of great Black & Decker products. This isn't one of them. Charged it up first time to use on my father-in-law's dead Lexus. Illuminated the dashboard. That's it. The Black & Decker outlet where I bought it kindly refunded my money no questions asked. I've never written a bad review on anything and hoped I never would have to, but when backup gear is so undependable and downright useless,the word needs to get out. Perhaps I just got a bad one, don't know, but judging by experiences of other reviewers, anyone serious about owning one of these definitely needs to proof test their purchase before it's needed."
3,Party item,"Product is good, but is not for random play. For a party with older individuals, it is a riot!"
3,Fun concept - not accurate though,"This makes a really fun party game - but it's definitely not meant to be taken seriously. It's by no means accurate. One of our party guests kept getting shocked on the first question, ""What's your name?"" - despite telling the truth. He was shocked for all subsequent questions. We couldn't figure out why the machine was singling him out. I myself was shocked on questions I answered honestly. But, that's what makes it such an uproariously funny party game."
4,Kid's Music for Adults,"If you're stuck in a car on a road trip, you could do much worse than to have this CD along. The kids love it, to be sure, but musically and lyrically it's masterful enough for the adults in the car to listen again and again.Along with Garcia/Grisman's ""Not for Kids Only,"" the Persuasions's ""Good Ship Lollipop,"" and the Seeger's ""American Folk Songs for Children,"" this CD allows us to share the joy of music with our children without driving ourselves insane in the process.Great fun!"
3,"Setzer great, video quality not","Setzer tears it up again on the screen but the quality of the video is not that great...the audio is fine, but I do like the live in Japan video better. He still has rockin' tone and tons of energy! This dvd is still a great watch!"
1,Writing In a Digital World . . .,"Mr. LaCounte has no business teaching anyone anything about writing. I have never read, in published form, so many grammatical, spelling, and homophonic errors! He has no conception of there/their/they're and other sound alikes. He has no concept of what is and isn't a contraction. Ways to show possession are a foreign language. If I could, I'd ask for a refund!"
2,Great product at a great price! WAIT !,"I recently purchased this for my desk and has great reception, where others have failed! You can attach earphones to it and not disturb anyone....sounds fabulous at an even better price.This radio died after only a few weeks, not worth the purchase!"
4,Philips AE150517 Portable Radio,This Philips radio is a reliable small radio. It comes with a headphone jack and is really excellent for portable purposes.The reception is excellent as it is equipped with a telescopic antenna. A good buy at a reasonable price; may be used as an add-on gift.
1,Poor Performing Product,"It has been my experience that this product software frequently crashes and does not permit you to do the exercises as outlined. I was not able to log off as administrator and log on as user, so I couldn't verify the effect of different permissions. With most exercises, everytime you close a window the users or groups you created are lost and can't be used in the next lab. The exercises do not cover enough of the topics like group policy. It does not cover all exercises as described in the text like on 70-290, but only a subset of the exercises presented in the text. So for me this product has been disappointing, overpriced, and a waste of money."
4,dealing with the simulator,This item is nice. There can be a few bugs to overcome when you first set it up depending on how your computer is set up. Once you over come the settings issue it works well and is rather fun to use. Very helpful product.
3,Review of MCSE Server 2003 emulator,"Although quite useful, the software only permits you access to the server functions covered in the area shown within the specific course areas.Any deviation from the subject matter and the emulator fails to function correctly.No advice is given if people stray from the guidance shown so for that reason alone the software needs updating.It would be better if the software behaved like a computer actually running the software, so errors encountered, would result in the kinds of problems actually encountered in real life."
3,Helpful overview with flaws,"Atwood's book is fairly comprehensive and very readable. I've found it to be a helpful resource. This only heightens my frustrations with the poor editing. For example: John Wesley is an Armenian instead of an Arminian in at least one place, and Jonathan Edwards starts his revival in Northampton, CT instead of Northampton, MA. (There is no Northampton, CT -- an editor should have caught this.) Still if you can overlook these occasional irritations, it's a good read."
3,not for singing,This mic is a nice comfortable mic but doesnt seem to work very well for vocals and has no sw to shut of
4,Good mic for the price,"As a (mostly) solo acoustic performer, I've been looking for ways to eliminate the amount of stuff between me and my audience. A good pickup on the guitar was the first step, a head-worn mic was the next. The mic needs a bit of equalization and is very quiet (a pre-amp with a 20db boost would help there...more shopping!), but once eq'd and balanced out, it works a treat. The only thing I truly don't like about the mic is the length of the wand: I wish it was just 3/4 of an inch longer: it sits right at the corner of my mouth and if I turn and put any tension on the cable at all, it pulls away and 'vanishes' almost completely. That said, I'm glad I bought it, and I would probably buy another if I needed it."
4,Nice Microphone,"I play keyboard for small audiences from time-to-time and needed something easier to use than my old Shur mic. This unit does everything I need. I usually run it through a pre-amp but I've also hooked it straight into my keyboard's auxiliary audio input. The pre-amp probably helps clean up the sound a little bit. I keep the boom to the side of my mouth so that it's not picking up breathing sounds...I have to speak up a little because of that but it's a small trade-off. I don't really sing so I can't comment on the mic from that respect. Basically, I have no complaints and recommend it."
4,Audio-Technica Pro 8HEx Headset Microphone,"Good quality omnidirectional microphone. Wish it were available with a 1/4"" jack.I use it with a SLR to Jack adaptor purchased separately. But it makes amess of dangling wires. The mike support is flimsy, too small, does not fiton the head, just on the neck/ears."
1,Sounds like a telephone speaker,"This is some sample sound of the Audio-Technica 8HEx recorded onto my Zoom H4 at an audio store. As you can hear, it sounds very poor -- like a telephone. It would only be suitable for AM radio, in my opinion. Sample is a high-quality .wav file.Audio Technica Pro 8HEx Headset Microphone"
3,Audio technica PRO 8HEx,"i ordered a Audio-Technica Pro 8HEx Headset MicrophoneSold by: Amazon.com LLC. It arrived, but turned out to be for a music system. The jack could not fit into a laptop/PC.What is the exact name of the headset I should order to use with dragon voice recognition software on a laptop? Is it a audio-technic a PRO8HE?Regards,squid"
3,Dark Backgrounds with dark lettering .....not user friendly,This would be 5 stars if it were not so dark. The games are great but the dark backgrounds make the end results of some of the games impossible to see without directing a flashlight onto the screen....why would the creators ever put black lettering on a dark gray background???
4,really good for killing time.,"i bought this game because i live in new york city, and i am always taking the subway; thus, i have lots of time to kill. if you've ever waited for the subway in new york then you know what i am talking about. about the game, i am 29 years old, so some of the games are useless, if you are over the age of 15 you probably won't ever play go fish, or crazy 8's, or old maid. but some of the other games make it totally worth it. klondike [isn't very good] because you can only flip through the deck once, meaning you will NEVER win. but i can easily kill an hour with hearts, gin rummy, or some of the other solitaire games. i definitely recommend this game if you take public transportation, or if you spend alot of time at the airport."
3,Found baby name using it,"I did find my daughter's name in this book (although not the spelling I choose to use) but I wouldn't recommend it for finding a boy's name. The girls names had a good selection but I felt for the average person looking for a different but not too weird name, there wasn't much to be found in the boy's section. Overall for the price I would recommend it if you are having a really hard time with names and need a book that can offer something different."
3,Lots of names,"The thing I didn't like about this book is that all the names didn't have pronunciation. I understand why the very common ones didn't (like Connor), but there were some that were a little different and kind of hard to decifer. I did like that the names were in an easy to read format, have meanings, and country origin."
5,Book of the Year,"This book is really terrific. I love the charachters, the plot, the mystery, the action, there's just so much to keep a person flipping to the next page! I bought Cain's Revenge on a whim, but liked it so much I went and bought the first book, Hero for Hire so that I would know the whole story of the courageous main chatachter Darien Steele. I have read both books cover to cover and have even bought copies for my friends and family. I have never read such an intense book with such surprising twists. I laughed and cried my way through Steele's life and really hope to see more from this hero."
1,Big Fake,"Men, why didnt I belive the reviews. Sometimes you still wanna try it out. This book has nothing to do with gay witchcraft. Its a general introduction into Wicca and therefor there are plenty of better books on the market. It doesnt reveal anything new to the gay practitioner and neither to other witches with a little bit of knowledge. If it wouldnt have this faked title, probably one could review it a little bit better (3 Stars) as a general guide into the Craft but so, one feels simply cheated. What a chance lost....."
1,Where's the gay?,"I have to concur with the other reviewers. Just take your other Wicca 101 books and every once in a while say ""And gay people can do this too"" and you will have everything this book has to offer. It seemed almost as if he wrote a regular Wicca 101 and then sprinkled things in randomly once it had been finished. Gay Witchcraft by Christopher Penczak looks much more promising."
2,Yawn...to say the least,"I must say out of all the YDKJ games I've played, (1, 2, 3, the ride, sports, and this) this one is the worst. I found it both very slow paced and boring. The reason it got 2 stars was because I got a few laughs out of it. Boy am I happy I only rented, because I would definitely not pay 20 bucks for this game."
2,First Off Get The First One!,"I must admit I was thrilled to get Mock 2, but after the first game, I put it on the shelf... way back... The graphics are cool, but they distract from answering the questions, and during the ""Jack Attack"" the colored backgrounds make reading the words on the screen very difficult. True its not Cookie hosting its Smitty, ie. ""YDKJ: TV"" for PC, that really doesn't bother me. I think new host and new intro to the question are a fresh idea. I just like being able to choose a catagory before the question. Mock 2 throws you right into a question. For my next YDKJ purchases I think I will stick to the PC versions.... Thanks!"
2,Meh.,"I bought this in anticipation of the 2011 edition coming out, and it was pretty much a complete dud. The poor pacing, bad jokes, inappropriate substitute host (one of the other writers - he's still working for Jellyvision) and on-the-cheap graphics really killed it for me."
2,The Ten Commandments - DVD,"the item arrived timely - was in excellent condition - - but, i did not like the story content. I purchased this DVD for our Children's Church and this movie was not as expected."
4,A LITTLE SHORT BUT SOME NICE PROJECTS,"I've always been on the DK books for being a bit on the short side. I know they're aiming them for kids but a little more bang for your buck would be great. That said the book does come with some worthwhile and fairly inexpensive decorations and tasty receipes to make for kids parties. And I do say younger kids, and not quite the 9 - 12 age group that the listing says it's geared to. More like 3 - 7.The Window silhouettes, while not new are well-done and they always make a good display if you have the proper lighting. There's tips on decorating your pumpkin and traditional games like Dangling Donuts. Most of it you may have seen before. Like all DK books it's bright and bold and the photography is first-rate. Not bad."
4,Good place to start,"This book is great for school crafts and kids' party ideas. I bought this book to use in a school setting and found it useful. The crafts are simple, but when you're working with 15 kids, that is what you want. Loved the lanterns, and they are a nice alternative/addition to carving pumpkins. They look good at adult parties too.The party food was also doable. Easy to make and looks & tastes good. Kids/adults will actually eat it and laugh! Liked the mood and layout, spooky without being gory. It's fun to just look through!Only wish that it was more extensive."
1,a politically biased view of society from the far left,The only resentment that is mobilized by this book is that of the conservative movement.
1,Wouldn't purchase again!,"I purchased this bag two weeks ago. I am still trying to get the horrible smell out! It has a very strong smell that I cannot get rid of. I have tried using febreeze, hand washed the bag twice, and even put it in the washing machine. I have also left it outside to air out for 3 days and the smell is still there.Overall, I like the style of the bag. The zipper doesn't seem as durable as the rest of the bag though. If I could get the smell out, the bag would be worth it... until then, it will sit unused!"
1,Really bad purchase,It is not at all what it looks like .......real waste of money...i choose this luking at its colour and d colour is not at all what it shows in picture and quality also is not at all grt .........for this quality d price is too high.........wouldnt recommend this to any....
4,Smells like leather,This is a great bag to use and I would get it again while though its for a man I could easily use this for my new gym bag
3,an okay clock,"I love the dual alarms as I can keep my original Mon-Fri alarm set while setting the second alarm for those days when I must wake up at a different time. However, there's a flaw in the design of this clock. The snooze button is much too close to the alarm reset button. As someone who uses the snooze button A LOT, I have gotten to work late several times because, in a still sleepy state, I have pressed the alarm reset button instead of the snooze button."
1,WRONG COLOR!,"Very upset that the product I received was not the one pictured. It came in a dark grey, nothing like the photo, so basically, its marinating in my closet."
5,art for the unwashed,The art in this book rocks. It's a very inexpensive voyage through the twisted underbelly of american psychosis.The artist has incredible technique to add to the over the top subject matter.
3,If you can only buy just one writers guide,If you can only afford to buy one writer's guideline manual skip this book. It's okay but Herman's smug attitude will get on your nerves very quickly and I was extremely unsatisfied with the section on agents. Unless you want to use this as a supplement to Writer's Market I'd say leave this rather expensive dud in the store.
1,Wrong information,"I haven't picked this book up, but just from the inside the book search, at least some of the information isn't correct. My former boss is still listed in this 2004 edition, even though he left the company in 2002, ditto with a couple of the other contacts. Be sure to check your information when you send queries out. I get at least 40 a month, and each one gets only a glance. Don't make it easy to throw your proposal away if right away you don't know what kind of books we publish or who the right person is to contact. Selling a book is like a job interview, imagine if you messed your interviewer's name up, would you honestly think you would get that job?"
3,So-So,"This book is fair. He is a little to negative for my taste, and his contempt for writers seems to come through a litte to much. Also, there are agents listed in his book that are known scams and con-artists, so he does not do that much research. If you want to find a good literary agent or publisher, go to the website ""Preditors and Editors"", and you find out all you need to know for free."
1,Double-Check EVERYTHING You Read In This Book!,"Before you accept any information in this book at face value, double-check it with another source (preditorsandeditors is a great source). Some of the agents in this book are scam artists. The fact that the author (who, as another reviewer pointed out, comes across as smug and obnoxious), either didn't know who he was recommending, or didn't care, should be enough to steer people away from this book."
3,Inaccuracies,"I haven't read this book, so this isn't a review as such - just a point of fact. I discover I am cited on page 53 as having written 'the supernatural thriller' Death in the Family. This could simply be a copy-editing problem, but there is nothing even faintly supernatural about Death in the Family or any of my other books, so this seems to add weight to the above comments about inaccuracies."
3,Almost fits PGS K30,"This mostly works on the PGS K30, but not perfectly. I have a post base for my K30 and the venturi tubes hit part of the post. I bent the very top part of the post out of the way so the tubes would not collide. The second problem is that this burner has cast in feet (standard one does not), which I believe is prevents it from being close enough to the electric ignitor box for the ignitor to work - so I have to ignite by hand."
5,"Inspirational, powerful, and beautiful (need more stars!)","This music and the genuine, emotional voice through which it flows can inspire us amidst great adversity.Each song relates with our own suffering, and then implores us to prevail against doubt, and strife. The sensitive and intelligent compositions and arrangements, paired with Leona's strong, compassionate voice elevate the spirit beyond many of the barriers and frustrations that separate and impede us as we strive to achieve peace and friendship and love.This CD has a message for anyone who's willing to hear it: Don't give up your faith, whether it's faith in God or yourself, and always treasure your family and friends, and remember that music is the universal language that brings us together.p.s. Be prepared to cry--this is the most heartfelt rendition of 'Amazing Grace' I've ever heard."
5,"Absolutely marvelous, tremendous talent, very powerful!",This is my favorite gospel CD. The combination of gospel music with a Carribean flare is very powerful. It motivates me. I am impressed with the tremendous vocal talent. The unique musical arrangements are pure genius. This CD has taken gospel music to another dimension. I want to hear more!
1,AHHHHHH the pain!,"I was forced to read this book for Philosophy class and it has scarred me for life. There aren't any pictures or anything. I finished a 1,000 word paper on it too. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
4,Nice intro,"I feel this is one of the better introductions to Postmodernism. It is a little clearer than say ""Teach Yourself Postmodernism"", which is also a very good introduction. If you want to understand the Postmodern idea, get both these books, they compliment each other very well IMHO."
4,""" A Horse Story That You Would Want to Cherish.""","Mustang:Wild Spirit of the West is a good story about a girl who loves horses all of her life. When she grows up, she tries to stop the killing of wild mustangs. It is a story that I'm sure you would enjoy."
5,Another wonderful story by Ms. Henry!,"Ms. Henry has such a way with character building, and I love how she builds her stories around fact. This story has loads of heart to it, and is a touching story for kids of all ages. It also discussed legislative process and how anyone has the power to fight for what they believe in and make a difference, no matter where they come from. A must read for any horse-loving child or adult."
1,Buy the real soundtrack,"My brother bought this on vinyl, and boy was he disappointed. Go and get the real thing which is one of the best soundtracks of all time"
3,Interesting For Fans & Collectors,"I saw this film when it was released in the UK and was stunned. It became our most hired video when that came out, which my friends and I watched with a regularity that bordered obsession. Not surprisingly, as soon as the LP was available, I bought it.There is no denying that the orchestral version is not as good as the actual soundtrack but for some reason it was the only one released at the time. It is a pleasant record and for me, will always be hugely evocative of the 80's and early 90's when it served as background music to countless evenings with friends.It's not brilliant but it is interesting. If you're fanatical about Blade Runner it's probably worth the few quid it costs, even if for no other reason than curiosity (though a scratchy vinyl disk from the time might be what you really want)."
2,Look elsewhere if you like the end theme...,"This CD does not contain the original end theme from the movie. If this is the one track you are looking for, look in the Vangelis section... Otherwise, all the other songs are great. However, odds are you seek the end theme (I did). The orchestrated version doesn't do it justice."
2,This Adaptation Doesn't Even Come Close,"If this film's score were an island then this 'adaptation' is in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean. It so far away in terms of a faithful adaptation that it bears almost no resemblance to the film whatsoever. Who approved this? And why? Just a crummy adaptation in every regard. Don't waste your money, either go with the 94' O.S.T. release; or if you read this in a timely manner, the September 2012 release of Blade Runner: A 30th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION by Edgar Rothermich."
4,A Good Soundtrack,"I have been searching for this version of the Bladerunner soundtrack for years. I've finally found it and it is as good as Vangelis's version. In fact I like the New American Orchestra's version of ""Memories In Green"" better than the original Vangelis version. The New American Orchestra version is more jazzy and has that blues quality to it I like. Both versions are good and finally I have them both."
3,Better than nothing,"The orchestrations are OK, I suppose, but they're not the actual music from the flick. Some of it sounds a little too disco. However, on the good side, Richard Tee's piano adaption of ""Memories of Green"" is very good. It effectively captures for me Deckard stuck in that rainy, cruddy city."
1,There's a much better soundtrack available to this movie,"This cd is the ""orchestrated"" version-- get the 1994 release ""Blade Runner- Vangalis"" instead. Unlike this one, the Vangalis version has his original recording of his score. It's much MUCH better."
2,eventually worked,"when i first put this in the printer, it seemed like it did not work ... i had to take it out and put it back in a few times, before it finally started working ... and even then the first time it worked, it tore the paper. now it works, but makes much more noise than my previous compatible non-OEM toner. i would not recommend it because of this experience; fyi - i am good technically, and i almost gave up on it !"
3,Charming melodies--mechanistic approach,"Slap ""Celtic"" on it, and I'm in the market. Plus, as a fan of the piano, I've been long disappointed in the dearth of Celtic music that has ever been expressed through that instrument (. . . apart from the orchestrated compositions of Phil Coulter). So, I basically like the album (but you see where I'm coming from). More critically: The renditions fail to use the fundamental nature of the instrument (which was originally named ""pianoforte"" because the musician could make both ""soft"" and ""loud,"" unlike with the harpsichord). Hence, the tunes come across as nearly computer-generated, with virtually no variation in rhythm or volume -- expressionless. By contrast, the albums of guitarist William Coulter (no relation to Phil) offer some of the same pieces -- but demonstrating how they can be translated with almost aching subtlety and sensitivity."
2,not as described,"Item described as 2 disk audio CD set. I love QOTSA as was really excited to recieve some live recordings of such awesome songs. What i recieved was a live DVD. still pretty awesome, but I want to be able to listen in my car or at work. I was disapointed."
4,one of better music dvd's i own,this is definately a must have for any QOTSA fans. they play stuff off of every album but play more off of the s/t and songs for the deaf than anything else. luckily they don't play much off of rated r (that album is definately the weak link). the sound quality is fantastic so don't be worried about that. it's got a bunch of bonus stuff when nick was still in the band.the only reason why i only gave this 4 stars is because it was basically only one show with only one line up. i really would have liked to get better recordings (and better camera angles) of their older shows. oh well.hopefully a kyuss dvd will eventually make it's way to shelves.
4,Something for everyone,This DVD is a must for any level of fan. The fact that you get both a DVD and a CD of live material is worth the price of admission. Good song selection on both discs with sound and video that's pretty decent as well. My favorite is the bonus part of the DVD as you get to see other incarnations of the band at various times in the ever evolving QOTSA lineup.With this in mind I was a bit disappointed with the main DVD portion as I've been a bit bored with QOTSA on their last 2 trips to the DC area supporting Lullabies to Paralyze. They've definitely lost their edge but hopefully they'll recover.
3,Undercover again.,"""Rigged for Revenge"" is your standard Hardy Boys book. Plenty of action, and a touch of education. Good book for kids."
3,Not their best work,"This is a cute book and my four-year-old likes cats, but the drawings are a bit evil-looking. The story is OK but overall, this is not the Buehner's best work. The snowmen books are a much better use of your money."
5,Good start up books,The book is very fundamental but I need this anyway. This book provides clarifications on the basic of trading. You will find terminologies quickly that you will need for trading which is very helpful to me. Don't expect this book to show you how to make money but to understand how trading works.
4,If you'll be mine,"Any time I listen to this song, it gets me in the right mood!! It's fresh, nice and... sweet!! I bought the album only for this track but I must admit all the songs are quite pleasant."
2,The friend who recommended it is no longer a friend,"My friend who recommended this cd is a""bad old man"" and to think that he didn't even buy it himself.The ""supertramp"" of the nineties."
1,"1 star because I can""t give it none","1. Does not have all the channnels correct2. Privacy policy just changed and since I bought a lifetime subscription, I really do not have the leverage to do anything about future changes3. Customer Service has not been very helpful, but they were polite4. It keeps recording pay per view movies I have not ordered - 2 hours of previews. Only way to stop is to mess up my profile or turn the feature off.5. It froze on me 2 weeks ago sometimes between bed and when I got home from work, the result was I missed some things that I really wanted to see. I should include that it was easy to fix...unplug and wait a few moments then it reset.This is a new technology from a new and small company. I think this is somewhat to be expected in early generations. I would recommend that you hold off for the next generation or two, but if you want it now, I hope you do not have all the problems I did."
1,Over hyped vcr,"An over hyped vcr. An over priced vcr. An under performer. Let me explain. I tried to set it to record my favorite shows through the season pass function. It did not work. It keeps thinking I also want it to record syndicated re-runs of those shows on other channels, and those take up too much space and interfere with some other programs. There is no way to differentiate. It just doesn't understand. This has turned out to be a case of technology being too dumb to be functional. I am going back to my trusted vcr."
5,Tivo Rocks,"I have been using Tivo since the very first unit's were shipped. This is my Wife's favorite piece of electronic equipment, my 8 year old daughter runs the device, it's the cleanest interface yet delivered on a piece of electronics. I now have two.Never miss a show, stop to listen to your significant others without missing anything. Catch those late night shows without being up late....No one who has ever used TiVo would EVER send it back.-- gary"
3,"Modem Burnups Cost Money II,or TIVO warranty is questionable","So far I have had two TIVO units lose modem function. The second time I was informed that the warranty on the replacement unit was only good for 30 days. I was also informed, the second time that the cause of the break was ""environmental"", i.e., there was probably a surge in the telephone line that ""fried"" the delicate modem. I was informed that this was a common NYC problem. Apparently Phillips is selling a faulty product and refuses to back it up.Bottom line: Phillips warranty stinks. Phillips and TIVO subscribe to the dictum ""caveat emptor"". I hear that Microsoft is coming out with a competitive product. If the unit breaks again I'm finshed with Phillips and TIVO."
2,Lack of IR compatability - AURGH...,"The concept of Tivo is great but when it comes to the user experience it is something totally different. 1) I sent in my refund stub and have yet to receive my money. 2) I have spent numerous hours trying to debug the communication between my cable box and Tivo, to no avail. The tech support people at Tivo admit that the device does not work with all cable boxes. BEWARE... ."
3,could be worse,"It's difficult to keep the litter box clean because this type of litter doesn't clump. The urine has to be almost completely dry before it can be scooped out. I've ended up mixing this with some traditional littler & it works better.On the positive side, it's so much more environmentally friendly. It doesn't have that nasty chemical smell or dust when you pour it into the litter box. It's lighter too - so it's much easier to change out."
3,Great odor control but tracks EVERYWHERE,"I tried this for a month and a half, and I'm going back to World's Best. This stuff has the best odor control on the market. It's amazing. But it gets everywhere. Litter mats do not help and have to be cleaned just like everything else. I'm sick of finding litter in the couch, my bed, all over the house.... also, if kitty has the runs, it sticks to kitty's bum and (gulp) paws and is really hard to wash off. Nope. Gotta go. I'm going to try their litter box spray with World's Best. I think that might be a win win."
2,Failed odor control,"Pros: Less dust / better for cat's health than clay litterCons: Failed odor control for cat's and humanSince it still stinks even though my cat covers it well after he's done, the cat's reluctant to use it next time and ends up taking care of his business somewhere else. He never does it with other kinds of clumping litters as long as I clean it everyday. Even with my various attempts such as cleaning twice a day, sprinkling deodorizing powder...etc, it's not doing well at controlling odor and thus the cat refuses to use it."
1,MOST DISGUSTING SMELL EVER,"I fell for this cat litter's ""marketing ploys"" and it is the most disgusting smelling cat litter EVER. It does not work in the slightest bit. I usually use World's Best and I wanted to try this because it supposedly had odor control. NOT!! (I use nature's miracle and this stuff is nothing like it at all) it supposedly lasts. NOT!! After ONE DAY the litter smelled like disgusting cat pee ammonia and disgusting fake pine smell. The smell was so attrocious that I actually had to stop using it, waste 3/4 bag and go back to ""world's best"" which is hands down the best cat litter I've ever used. I'm going to try the green tea leaves one next, but it better be better than world's best or i'm not switching."
3,"clumps well, but don't like the smell","I've been using this for a long time with 6 cats in the house and I think it clumps really well. The reason I'm looking for a new brand, however, is because the smell is really getting to me. It's bad enough to smell the pee/poop smells, but when you layer a perfume-y smell on top of that it almost makes it worse. This heavy scent doesn't smell natural to me. I wish they made it in unscented, I'd probably stick with it. Are you listening, Nature's Miracle? Unscented, please. I do like that it's biodegradable. It tends to track a bit, but because it's such a good clumper I ignored the tracking. If it came in an unscented version, I'd give it 4 stars. Enzymes are good, as long as they're unscented.UPDATE: I finally found a new brand and I like it much better. See my review for World's Best Multicat with ""wow"" as the review title."
2,Product not as pictured,"The product advertised is the ""old"", original litter. It has bigger granules and is pine scented. However, that is not what I received. (I received the ""new"" nature's miracle). Seller needs to update description and picture."
4,Very entertaining,"Found this at my library and decided to give it a try. I don't normally read sci-fi, maybe 1 or 2 books a year. Spindrift was very entertaining. I have not yet read the Coyote Trilogy but plan to do so now. As stated before, the editing sucked, but it can be overcome."
4,Time Killer,"This isn't bad for a free book. I haven't read any other book by this author, and coming in on the middle of the story didn't really put me out. Although it had it's share of typo's and sentences that made no sense, the book was readable. I like the idea of the story even if the ideas behind the technology and human/alien interaction were antiquated or too common for most sci-fi fans. It was a good way to kill a few evenings."
1,"Formulaic, barely worth reading, full of typos","This is an ACE book and evidently went to press without anyone actually reading it. Every couple pages there are sentences with missing words or words transposed that jerks you out of the plot (such as it is). E.g. page 218 ""So what else have you able to hypothesize? If that's not to much ask that is."" Missing been and to.The story seemed simplistic and formulaic. Obligatory sexual relations, check. Obligatory despised leader, check. The usual alien hollowed out asteroid ship, check. Mercifully it ended but it did so rather quickly as if the author got tired of writing."
5,Great job,Excellent movie for the whole family.Fast delivery and in excellent condition.Can watch it over and over again.Has humor and sadness both.
5,A must buy for every stutterer,This is the best book on stuttering. ever ...It has got a bit too many pages in order to cover all casesof stuttering.. Most people will want to skim forward andhighlight the points you want to read again and again....I read this book every 10-15 days and do exercises andmy fluency improves...
4,Have not read it all but look good,It is one of the good book I read eventhough the writer used more technical words that may not be easy for lay man.
3,Stuttering is a Learned Behavior,"I ordered this book hoping that it would contain some new insight to my disfluency. I was somewhat disappointed. The author did do a good job of describing his theory, which I don't buy into. The self help exercises outlined aren't worth the effort. There was nothing in this book that described stuttering as a learned behavior. The simple fact is that stuttering is a conditioned response to a early childhood stress. Stuttering becomes habitual through repetition and a poor self-perception. One who truly wants to achieve fluency should study the writtings of Napoleon Hill and Norman Vincent Peale, and apply their success techniques to Stuttering. Scientific Prayer also played a big part of my recover."
4,Todays Girls- Tangled Web,"This is an excellent book. I gave it four stars being that it wasen't my favorite book in the series. This is a great series for young girls, but I think teenagers and older pre-teens can relate the best to these books. I highly recommend starting with book #1 (Stranger Online) as for you can get a better feel of the girls personalities and it would be much easier to follow. I won't give away the story line as for I JUST HATE IT when I find out what happens before I read the book. :)"
3,Not a regular episode of Dragon Tales,"Our daughter loves Dragon Tales the series. However, this is the one DVD she won't watch."
2,Dragon Tales Video without stickers,"The video was fine and it was wonderful to find it years after Dragon Tales went out of production. We love that show here!However, it should not have been advertised as having a sticker set with it if that set was long ago used up and would not be sent with the product. I somehow assumed that, since stickers were mentioned, they would be forwarded as well. Sorry to say they were not with the video.Again, we would have been okay with it if we had known that in advance. But I believe in truth in advertising."
3,"OKAY, BUT NO CIGARS!","There's just something about the album that makes it my least favorite. ""Hold Me"" and ""Gypsy"" are okay. I guess Mac JUST LOST THEIR TOUCH FOR A WHILE. McVie's and Nicks' songs are the best. Buckingham did awful on ""Eyes Of The World"" and ""Oh Diane."" Even though I don't many positives to say about this I would like to own it."
3,A Band?,"All I can say is, sorry too much Lindsey. For a band effort, I felt rather shortchanged. I like the album more than I did in 1982, but wish there was more of an even split for Stevie and Christine."
2,If it wasnt for Lindsey,"If not for Lindsey Buckingham this album would have been great. He openly admits songwriting is not a strong point for him. He has had only one exelent song since Rumors and thats Big Love. Stevie and Christens' songs were great especally Gypsy, Straight Back, and Thats Alright, Hold Me, and Love in Store. I heard Stevie say that Gypsy was going to go on her Wild Heart album luckly for Fleetwood Mac, she gave it to them. I think Lindsey Buckingham is unfortanately a has-been. I hate to say that but it true. Over all I would rank this a 2 star."
3,"""Mirage"" is no ""Rumors""","Were ""Mirage"" the first Fleetwood Mac album, it wuld probably not have been a disappointment. Unfortunately, living up to the standars of their massive hit ""Rumours"" proved to be a tough task indeed. ""Hold Me,"" is an excellent single, and there are plenty of other agreeable, radio-ready songs on this album. But ultimately, it lacks the fierce emotions that fueled the band's best work. Ardent fans will love this album, casual fans will probably find it wanting."
2,Wait for a Remaster,"The Mac's most underrated album is still a pleasure to listen to nineteen years later; in fact the songs actually sound less dated and more contemporary than the Rumours-era stuff, aside from ""Gypsy,"" which was on the radio constantly during the early/mid eighties (and is still a sublime piece of work). The problem is that the audio quality on this CD is atrocious--low fidelity, tape hiss, etc. One would do better to get an original vinyl copy, which, believe it or not, is a vast improvement over the transfer that was done here. Let's hope Warner Bros. gets around to restoring this one soon..."
4,What wrong with this??,"This album suffers the same fate as Tusk did. What record executive in their right mide expects a band to sell 20 million copies everytime out. And then call a 4 million seller a flop, they were expecting to much. And for that reason Fleetwood Mac had to take two steps backwards and bring out Mirage. All in all a good album, Stevie Nicks makes one of her best contributions of her Fleetwood Mac career with ""Gypsy"", and so does Christine McVie with ""Hold Me"". Artistically absent on this album is Lindsey Buckingham whose songs, while good songs to listen to, lack something his previous work had. The album all together sounds to pop and was a dangerous step for this band to take. They would recover in 5 years with Tango In The Night only to fall back again with Behind the Mask in 1990. This is a good album for anyone who is a serious Mac fan but not recomended for the casual listener."
4,Shines,"Between Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie, this record shows the most familiar front-line of this enduring band at their best. Very few other records (Rumours, and possibly the white Fleetwood Mac album) can compare. I refer the new listener to tracks #1, #7, and #9. Let us not forget Stevie Nicks, whose ""leftover"" tracks from her first solo album are incredible. ""Gypsy"" remains a classic, not merely because of Ms. Nicks' delivery and performance, but because Lindsey Buckingham played a guitar solo worthy of Clapton and Santana, both. One wonders how he did it. Not all the songs are instant classics, but all are worthwhile."
2,Where's the Beef ?,Such a wonderful album (one of Fleetwood Mac's best in my opinion) and yet such a HORRIBLE recording. The label that allowed this out the door and onto retail shelves should be ashamed of themselves. This sounds just horrible. I wont play this album if I have people in my car with me because I didn't spend 2 grand on my sound system to have someone tell me my stereo blows. 4 stars for this great album...then subtract 2 for the recording quality.
3,POOR SOUND,"This is the worst sound quality CD I have heard and I've heard thousands. Don't buy until Warner Brothers can get the original master tape and remaster this correctly, my record sounds better then the CD!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on stands, although these were not the cheapest either. I did however expect them to be better than what I received. The bases arrived damaged (or poorly constructed) in that the covering was missing at the rear corners. The channel for the wiring was impossible to remove according to the directions. I usually send back items like this but they went in a room where the damage was not visible and I really didn't want to deal with the whole return process."
5,Better than I expected!,"I must admit I purchased this CD for Schicksalsliede alone, but I was PLESANTLY suprised that all of these works by Brahms were EXCELANT! But what more can you expect from the Master or Romanticism?"
4,Great sound --- bad display,"I bought this unit based on other reviews and I am very pleased with everything except the display. Our clock sits aross a 10x12 room and I cannot read the time on the display from the bed which defeats the purpose of having a clock. The display is pretty large with a blue background and black numbers and all I can see from across the room is the blue screen, which is like a small TV screen. I have adjusted the brightness but have not tried it out yet. We had it set on the brightest setting last night and couldn't read the display. The alarm is great because it starts off at a low volume and gently increases so as not to startle you. It can be set for radio, or CD. If you are going to put this unit close to the bed it is great but if you keep your clock across the room, I might reconsider."
2,Too many buttons spoil the broth,"The clock itself has loads of great features, unfortunately the big problem is the cluttered interface with its myriad of tiny buttons. It is far too easy to accidentally switch off your alarm by pressing the wrong button, especially in dim light. And setting the alarm even when you are pressing the right buttons is not foolproof either. Your money would be better spent on a simpler machine."
2,"Nice radio, bad clock","The radio is good, and I like the digital tuning and volume control, but I must add my agreement with those who complain about the clock face. It is too bright, and at the same time the numbers are completely invisible if you are looking at them from any angle below the level of the clock. Philips would do well to go back to the drawing board quickly on that point."
2,Better get a nightstand flashlight for it.,"Pro: It sounds ok. This price isn't the shafting *I* got when I bought mine! It allows you to set the volume of the alarm and can increase it from silent to blasting you out of bed. Worth keeping it despite belowCon: The digital tuning is easy to use but sometimes you don't HAVE 30 radio stations in your area to program. But you still have 30 settings to scroll through. Not a great design, but at least it works like it's supposed to. As opposed to the dim, dimmer, dimmest blue backlighting. Mine is out now. You can only see the display looking down on this very tall radio, anyway.If you buy this, don't forget to buy a separate alarm clock so you can find the time. (Pssst...don't let it be a Philips. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice...)"
4,Good signal reception for those in odd places,"Yes, the display is problematic (but OK for me), but I bought this largely because it was the only radio that could get the FM stations I wanted to listen to (NPR and college stations at the end of the dial). Stations come from Philadelphia here (50 miles away from me), and this product was the only one to clearly get the stations in the store. If you get it for this reason, I did not extend the antenna -- just left it rolled up and the reception was awesome.The features are great and it is lovely to have much of my nightable back."
2,"Gee Mommy, thanks for the nightlight clock radio...","All in all, I really wanted to like this unit, but unless you are prepared to have your bedroom illuminated by that darn back-lit LCD at night, this just isn't a keeper. The features are nice, but the LCD screens brightness and legibility factors (or lack thereof) unless you are looking at it straight-on, made me return it."
3,"Oh, it's not so bad!","I remembered this book fondly from my childhood, although when I tracked down a copy for my preschooler recently I had to say, ""Hmmm..."". My mother used to tease my brother and me by quoting the naughty little old automobile: ""No! I don't want to and I WON'T!"" when we were being cranky, and I was charmed by the way the old auto parts were re-used for animal homes, a tire swing, etc., at the end of the book.That said, it's kind of an oddity, especially for modern readers. I can see why the previous reviewer disliked it: the car's repeated running over of innocent creatures (though none are killed) is not NICE, and when the auto meets its fate (hit by a train), it's perhaps not the most edifying message. The illustrations aren't as good as I remembered them, either. Some kids will find it funny--maybe it will help them with their own aggressive feelings; others may be disturbed by it. Our daughter neither loves nor hates it, but it didn't turn out to be a favorite of hers."
1,lost soul,The only thing that Mr. Albert has accomplished in writing this book is that early on in the book he confesses to be a Christian. So then why does he proceed to write a book that proves beyond any doubt that he hasn't the slighest clue as to how someone becomes a Christian. This book blasphemes God and glorifies Satan as does any new age book.
1,fodder,"I saw an add for this book in the Atlantic Monthly that caught my eye. I was a sucker and bought it. This is a horrible book. The only reason someone would by this book is if they know the author and feel pity towards him. (Mother). All-around a poor disorganized bastardization of ""Into the Wild"", ""On the Road"", etc. No doubt the other wrote the 5-star review. Luckily, I was able to return my copy for a refund."
5,Wonderful Guide! But a few quibbles...,"A wonderful guide, as expected! I live in the eastern US and use my Peterson guide to the birds of eastern North America almost daily -- it is, in my view, a perfect field guide to birds. I bought this guide for use when traveling on the west coast.I have two relatively minor complaints with the Field Guide to Western Birds. First, unlike in the Field Guide to Eastern Birds, there are no thumbnail range maps next to the descriptions -- all the range maps are in the back of the book. Second, nowhere in the descriptions are we told how common the species is (also unlike in the Field Guide to Eastern Birds). This latter piece of information is helpful in the field -- in identifying birds, it's good to know how probable or improbable it is that you're seeing a particular species, both to help rule out unlikely birds and to gain appreciation of conservation issues.Other than these pretty minor quibbles, I love this guide."
3,not useful in the field,Not very useful in the field and in fact there are many species that aren't listed. The worst part of this book is the cross reference indexes.
1,A Field Guide to Western Birds: A Complete New Guide to Field Marks of All Species Found In North America West of the 100th Meri,"This is an excellent book if you are a bird watcher. My husband received a copy of this book as a gift a couple of years ago and has since worn it out,that was the purpose of purchasing a new copy."
4,A good book to add to your library.,"I found this book to be typical of all Peterson guides. It's a useful book to have but not the best available. In typical Peterson fashion the book shows illustrations of birds instead of photos. While some find this more useful for showing details all too often I've found that the drawings like little like the actualy birds.However this book does contain the bird's comman and scientific name for each species. In addition it has a physical description of coloration and markings, a description of the habitats where they are likely to be found, their geographic distribution, notes on their song and any similar species when applicable.I find that this is a nice addition to the Stoke's Field Guide which shows pictures instead drawings.Definitely a nice addition to your library."
3,Does the job but better guides out there,"I have owned this book for close to 7 years and have used it in WA, ID and MT. It does an ok job of assisting in bird ID. That being said there are better guides out there to spend your money on. I have recently switched to the Sibley Field Guide to Western Birds for a number of reasons. The advantages of that guide over the Peterson are that useful field marks are highlighted with arrows, there is a more comprehensive write-up for each bird, the plate for each species is separated from the others on the same page and finally the range map is displayed on the same page as the ID plate. I would not recommend this as a primary guide, but rather as a resource to supplement other field guides. I find IDing to be much easier with the Sibley."
3,good book,"I had a peterson for over 25 years, dragged it everywhere, finally thought I should up grade my books to just western, since I live in oregon. still love the pictures and details, but the range maps have strangely gone to the back of the book! Horrible.So i use the sibleys, then I use this when I am sure I am close to the correct range.May be they will put the range maps back where they belong, am hanging onto my old copy!keep on birding"
4,Backyard Birder,"I am just an amateur, but this book has helped me identify many birds that frequent our area."
4,Field Guide To Western Birds,"The book is excellent in most respect. But like all of these types it doesn't provide much help in actually identifying a bird. You can't go from ""small-brown-stripes on side-purple head-green feet-S. Az area to Pages xxx & xxx for the types."
5,a good book on sharing the gospel via the internet,"This is an important""how to"" manual for novice and experienced web users for sharing the good news of Christ via hyperspace.In all probability,we will see more advances in technology in the next few months than we have seen in the past 10 years.It is very important for Christians to have the knowledge to be able to use this electronic medium to reach the lost and Andrew Careaga has written a comprehensive guide to do just that.Highly recommended reading. Praise God for the world wide web and the opportunities it presents for God's people."
3,In hot pursuit of bad guys,"Rina and Peter Decker go to Israel to solve a murder and find two missing teen-age boys. Peppered with Hebrew words and phrases. We get a descriptive tour of the Holy Land, while the Deckers are in pursuit of the bad guys.International diamond dealers, high finance, and down to earth cops. ( I like her reference to ""Detective Sturgis"" at West L.A.)"
1,Bored,"Faye is a good author but, I am so tired of all the Jewish terminology in all of her books. I read for pleasure not to learn another language. Once would have been fine and interesting. Twice was just OK. It has gotten to be so bad I will not read any of her Peter Decker books. Such a shame as they would be great if she would just speak English. I hope she reads these reviews."
4,"Fill Your Watercolors with Nature's Light R, Roycraft",This book is set out clearly and attractively which makes you want to get going and try the methods suggested.
1,Mindless Mundane trance,"You know, I am a firm believer that all music should be given a chance...and so with an open mind and a clear head I took a listen to Sapphirecut's release, and was shocked at the poor taste. Cheesy synth sounds and droning female vocals make for a very very poor listen. This is a great example of the trend in many genres right now, the song refuses to progress. I keep waiting for something to happen, and every mix leaves me feeling the exact same- bored. I get the impression that sapphirecut was heavily influenced by big trance acts like those found on the platipus label. The frame for a good trance song is there, but it lacks the heart and the emotion that made the monumental trance acts, well, monumental. And as much as I *hate* to admit it, D. Tenaglias remixes were a real miss too...though I dont blame him for it, it's hard to take a song that was bad in the first place and make it phenominal."
1,0 stars for this commercial dance cd,"I got this track from soulseeker.com after I heard about this women closing down this website. It's funny because she got a lot of PR from this, both good and bad, but it ended up selling a lot of cd's and making this ""group"" so popular. The tracks are so typical of other commercial dance that has been around for years.This artist is trying to be something new but the music is old and boring. I heard a leak of her new alblum and it was more of the same dull tracks."
1,Boring electonic pop,"All of these songs on this cd were typical trance tracks.Instead of freeing my mind it stole my mind.The repeating female whispers were torture.I downloaded samples of the new songs and they were downright boring. Although, I do like Danny T's tracks."
2,Not fooled for a minute,"I had high hopes for this book, but I was quickly disappointed. Reading it is something like seeing Jack Nicholson playing Mark Twain in a one-man show: never at any time do you believe that the man onstage is anyone other than Jack Nicholson. Likewise, as I read, I saw only Banks at work, never Owen Brown. Banks has taken an interesting premise and used it as a pretext for his own literary pretensions. When I was younger, I would have eaten this novel up, but today I have very little tolerance for novelists who have nothing better to write about than the color of the leaves and every nuance of their feelings--especially when presenting them as the reminiscences of a genuinely interesting historical character."
5,Powerful compelling reading!,"Those fascinated with the Civil War such as I am and those who just want to read a meaty, richly-detailed novel will both find satisfaction in Cloudsplitter. I found this novel took a lot of careful reading to make sure that all of the details fit together. However, the reward in the rich writing style, intense characterizations and constantly flowing action is well worth the effort. I found it hard to remember that this was actually a fictionalized story. It reads as a powerful and believeable book of self-told history. The details relating to lifestyle, physical places and the everyday life of the characters of the book ring true to time and place. Even though anyone who knows some Civil War history knows exactly the outcome, the book holds your interest until the very last page. Not light reading, Cloudsplitter requires a commitment to spending a fair number of hours with this masterfully written story."
3,"Interesting story, but tedious.","The first 3/4 of this book could benefit from editing to about half-length. I wonder, why the title of Cloudsplitter? Sure, it was refered to several times, but was in no way relevant to the story, nor involved in any part."
3,This book needs an editor.,Somewhere in here is a story...but the author repeats the same material so many times one becomes frustrated and bored. I'm finishing it only as a matter of principle. Suffering is character building they say.
3,"Interesting, but what's true and what isn't?","John Brown will remain a mysterious figure even after reading this story. It is difficult to get a true picture of the man without knowing which parts are fictional or not. The book does paint him as a sometime gentle, sometime fanatical character. At any rate, it is clear he was determined to abolish slavery at any cost, including loss of human life. If the information about his children is correct, the family had many tragic situations arise. I would recommend reading a concise non-fictional biography before tackling this one."
4,Pretty good,"This is a very interesting novel, with emphasis on the word novel. It is not meant as true history. That being said, I enjoyed it. An equivalent book, with the same heft and clout -- but not a novel -- is Edward Renehan's THE SECRET SIX: THE TRUE TALE OF THE MEN WHO CONSPIRED WITH JOHN BROWN, published recently to wildly enthusiastic reviews. -- Arnold Roosevelt"
2,"A noble effort, but ultimately disappointing","This book has some enormously moving and powerful scenes, but after 500 pages or so, I grew weary of the self-pitying narrative of the novel's protagonist, Owen Brown.As a character, Owen is full of resentment towards his father, conflict about his religion, thinly-veiled homosexual yearnings, and agonizing indecisiveness about his place in life. The narrative explores these conflicts over and over as Owen tried to find his place (and never does).For much of the book, Banks paints John Brown as the all-powerful sun in Owen's wretched universe. Then he asks us to believe that John Brown ""lost his nerve"" in Bleeding Kansas and had to be goaded on by Owen, who has suddenly become strong and decisive. (If I were Miss Mayo, the fictional recipient of this tome, I'd take Owen's self-serving account of these events with a grain of salt.)It's too bad, because there is a great book hiding within all this mish-mash. Shame a good editor didn't get ahold of it."
5,Beautifully interpreted Schubert-Liszt song transcriptions,"Jorge Bolet achieved a remarkable level of pianistic beauty in this studio recording of Liszt's transcriptions of 12 songs by Franz Schubert. His tone is subtle and varied, the melody lines sing and the accompanying motifs are clear and lucid. His tempi are restrained, doing justice to the many nuances in each piece.My favorite is ""Auf dem Wasser zu Singen"" (track 8), a beautiful Schubert song in its own right but elevated to a religious hymn by Liszt who created an ascending line in the placement of the melody through the verses, increasingly intricate accompaniment and starker dynamic contrasts throughout the song; and who added a forth verse (the original has three) with a more jubilant and victorious tone, culminating in a coda where higher and higher repetitions may suggest the soul ascending to heaven.(note that this recording is far more beautiful than the Bolet rendition of the same song that is available on u-tube)."
2,A great book to teach anatomy and physiology EXCEPT...,"I got this book from the library to preview it before purchasing it. I loved the pictures in the book and how it was divided up. I have a problem with one picture though, which I believe will prevent me from purchasing this title. I have NO problem with the pictures of the reproductive tracts, this is basic biology. I DO have a problem with the detailed schematic of sexual intercourse in progress and a full descriptive caption about what happens during intercourse. I find this inappropriate for a book aimed at children as young as 9. I'd rather my children learn about this wonderful God-given act of love and commitment from me rather than from a picture book. I'd appreciate an email from the author as to why he would include this in a book made for young children.Karen HomeSchoolMom67@aol.com"

4,very good tool for the price,powerful tool capable of getting the job done.it is also easy to use . heavy tool about 25kg or so
3,Good Luck Finding Chisels!!,"I agree with the ""packaging"" issue. If they offer insurance, take it. The box it comes in was not made for individual shipping. I bought it off of another website and didn't pay close enough attention to the description. They did not include the scaling bit as pictured and I have spent hours online and hours traveling to try and find one (bought two online which didn't fit).Now for the positive, for the money this is one strong pony. Busts up cement and concrete with ease."
1,burnt out,"Got item but wasn't the same color as the silver one, it was an off green with same color case, seemed hard and solid like the review said.The job at hand was hammering out 5"" concrete basement slap for french drains. the first time i used tool: the motor housing made a terrible burning smell and i gave the thing a break. the next time i used it, within a half hour, the tool starting sparking and smoking... at this point it seemed like a real shock hazard and i threw it in the 20 yard dumpster and rented out the bosch brute from the tool rental for 84$ cracked out the whole basement in 6hrs with that brute."
3,Good home or occasional professional use -- NOT real pro grade,Got this just a few days ago and have been trying it out punching holes in the flower beds of my rocky hilltop home; does just fine. Just keep in mind it is not 50 pounds of Ingersol Rand *real*jackhammer; I would advise against trying to do long continuous runs such as busting up a reinforced concrete patio or building foundation. Major limitation I noticed is the cooling fan can't seem to keep up with continuous use. I just use it 2 ~ 4 minutes at a time and it does just fine with a couple of minutes off time to cool down.Have not used it long enough to get a feel for how much use the bits can take before they need resharpening. The strength quality -- and price -- of the tool steel is a factor in this kind of device.
1,SCAM FAKE!!!!!!BEWARE,ITEM IS NOT MARKED ANYWHERE NEIKO NO REAL WARRANTY 30 DAYSSCAM FAKE ITS NOT AUTHENTIC NEIKOGOES ON A MARY GO ROUND CHEAT FALSE ADVERTISINGNO LABEL NO MARKING NO NEIKO QUALITY SCAM
5,Great Help,"I manage a plant in the coal slag industry up in North Dakota. This year has been a challenge to keep the plant running with melting snow and subzero temperatures. The ice which has been up to 6"" thick will freeze the conveyor belts making it impossible to run the plant. I purchased one of the jack hammers and was so impressed I purchased a second one. You really can't beat the price and it does a great job clearing the ice.The hammer does have some weight behind it which can be a slight draw back, but then it is a jack hammer.The case is cheap and the extra motor brush blocks that came with it were broken but I haven't needed them yet.Its hard to beat the preformance for the $200 you pay."
5,Neiko Jack Hammer,"I used this item to put drainage tile in my basement which has a concrete floor. Even though the unit was not that expensive, it worked outstandingly. I would highly recommend this unit for any one in need of it."
3,"Product bust, service #1","I bought this product to do my kitchen floor, but ended renting a jack hammer from HD instead. The product is completely worthless. After only 20 minutes into the job sparks started flying and the casing become so hot that couldn't be held. I contacted the seller and their support was fast and supportive. I received an MRA within couple of days and promptly refunded back to my credit card. I give 5 stars only for service, -5 stars for product quality. I would buy from this vendor again, but not made in China products."
4,Whats the fuss...,"I mustve been lucky. No oil, no mess like most of the reviewers . Case arrived in tack an undamaged as well. Overall i like this jack hammer. Once you learn the tricks to operation it works well. One handy feature i like is that you can set it to stay on, rather than just short bursts or holding the on button. Found that out by accident.Cool. overall satisfied. Has already paid for itself during a soil stack excavation."
4,USE AR THE RANCH,"YES FOR SMALL JOBS IT WORKS OK,I HAVE A GAS ONE ,BUT IS TO HEAVEY THIS ONS OK, IT OK ICAN HANDEL IT"
5,Industrial Grade Electric Jack hammer,"This product was more than what I expected. It seemed sturdier and worked better than the Milwaukee demolition hammer that I had rented for $45/day. There is some oil that leaks from the casing slightly, and from the end of the bits that go into the unit, but it is not too bad. It is well worth the money!"
3,OK hammer,This hammer arrived slightly damaged but not bad enough to complain. It has amble power for small jobs such as hammering out fence post piers but lacks the umph for sidewalks and the sort.
4,Poker Top,"Came very quickly. Table had small crack in one cupholder probably due to shipping. The table tops should probably be packed a little better. The pokertop, however, is really nice."
3,poker night,This was very decent for the price I paid. It came with some marks and dings and I couldn't get the poker table completely flat either. I haven't tested the other table tops yet.
4,Awesome and fun,Love the felt poker table top...only thing is that one of the plastic cup holders was chipped but instead of returning that part I decided to keep it and love it's imperfection. As far as playing on the felt table top - it perfectly fits the table it's on and the cards easily glide when dealt. A wonderful purchase overall. I highly recommend it to all!
4,Texas Holdem Table Top,"This product will do exactly the job it was designed for. I am pleased with with the quality, and feel that it is a good value I recommend it to all who enjoy poker."
4,"Not well known, but a real gem",Probably my favorite Susan Sarandon film with a brilliant supporting cast. Very entertaining. I fell in love with Susan because of this film!
3,Mildly humorous,"This is a comedy who-done-it about a philandering Long Island dentist who is murdered, and the subsequent investigation by ex-newspaperwoman (Susan Sarandon). The dentist had been making it with a number of women, none of whom want that detail disclosed and any of whom could have killed him. Some of the scenes are funny as the women try to cover their tracks, especially after nude photos are discovered. But the social message of the movie (Sarandon working again aginst her husband's wishes for her to be a homemaker) gets to be a drag, and the ending, with Sarandon caught in the house alone with the real killer (a man), is too long and drawn out."
5,Timeless & Real,"To the people who are concerned about the 'dated' clothes in the book, please remember the kids having this book read to them are going to be too young to know that. Besides, lots of classic children's stories feature Victorian or even Renaissance Era clothing, so just think of this as classic 70s vintage style.As for the pages that focus on feeling left out because of the new baby, that is what is great about Mr Rogers: He sees things from the child's perspective, and the truth is that nothing is more important to a child than him- or herself, and it IS a bummer no longer being the 'baby', no longer having all the attention from the parents, etc. Through the text and photos, it is acknowledged that those feelings exist, and then shown that there are positive things about having a younger sibling also. To get this message across it is essential to meet children where they're at, developmentally speaking, and Mr Rogers always knows where that is!"
5,essential for any REAL KoRn fan!,"If you've been a KoRnster since Day 1, you'll love this video. you can see them the way they used to be, when they were just 5 regular guys having fun, not big-ass rock stars. This was about the time they were recording Life Is Peachy so they are in their prime. You get to see the real koRn and they say some pretty funny stuff!"
5,KORN ROCKS!!!,"This is one of the best movie i have! It shows how they first started out and showing them making there first album. and shows some of there videos like ""Blind"", ""Clown"", ""Shoots and Ladders"", and ""Faget"". I have never seen them videos until i got ""Who Then Now"". This video also tells about how Munky, Head and Fieldy got thier nicknames. So to all the KoRn fans who don't have this video yet GET IT!! its totally worth it."
5,KoRN rules!,"this was a great movie! it made my laugh a lot! great videos of blind, clown, and shoots."
2,Good for a beginner,The theory in this book and its theological background is pretty good. The actual nutritional advice was lacking. I found much of the nutrtional information outdated.
5,Awesome book!!,A must for all law enforcement and their families. I truly enjoyed this book and it is a very easy read!
4,Excellent Read,"I read this book as part of my Master's Degree education. I have to say this is one of the easiest, most informative reads I have ever completed. The book is an excellent source for understanding the highs and lows that patrol officer's experience during their regular life. Going from an adrenaline high during a hot call to a relatively boring home life of sitting in front of the television will cause emotional changes in an officer. That officer is unable to comprehend how these changes are effecting them, their emotional health will suffer and most likely they will take their negative attitude out on their family. This book will help officers understand this change and be able to identify when they are feeling the negative impacts of this change."
5,Law Enforcement Officers are People Too!,"A small, powerful text to remind the entire law enforcement community, from the Director or Chief to the newest cadet, of the balance needed to pursue and complete a law enforcement career with a sane vision and balanced living of life with family, friends, and loved ones. It is often presumed that law enforcement officers are ""above all that,"" and simply ""suck it up"" while going on to the next assignment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Dr. Gilmartin in a scholarly but simple manner engages us in the reality of an officer's emotional life, which in time always will effect his physical, psychological, and spiritual lives as well. His comments are highly operable in other caregiver professions as well."
3,Soooo... How do I fix/prevent this?`,"The first 2/3's of the book are explaining ""symptoms"" of police work and hyper vigilance, but the author seems to restate the same concepts over and over. very redundant.It's very valid stuff, but there is NOT enough ""how to fix/prevent"" information in the text. Seems more like a ""just FYI keep an eye out for this____"""
4,Pretty great stuff,"I guess I was a little spoiled, having watched and listened to the fabulous ""Live at Montreaux"" DVD before this one. Here, Rory and his band are as good as ever, however, the sound quality, especially on the first DVD, is compressed and sounds ""bootleggish"". Also, this German TV announcer breaks into the concert every now and then, with this inane and very annoying chatter. Those quibbles aside, this is fine stuff that encompasses the time period 1976 - 1990. Highly recommended."
2,"BETTE IS ""GREAT""...IN AN AVERAGE MOVIE!!!","This movie was plain boring...An old and used up plot...looked low budget.A weak cast, other than the greatest actress ever!Even the great Bette Davis could not save a bad movie by herself, but she sure did try.I guess that's part of what makes you great.OK movie if you are a Bette Davis fan, but not one that you'll find yourself watching more than once."
3,Going..Going..Gone,"....This is a pretty odd movie. Taken at face value, you have to wonder at Bette Davis doing it. Was she really at the point in her career that she would be forced to do nothing movies like this? Was it a chance to take a big time swipe at the movie star ethos that she felt herself above? Was it just a chance to take a cheap hot at Joan Crawford, the ultimate movie star, and someone that she loathed? We'll never know, but we do have this little jem to show for it."
3,Only for Davis's most loyal fans,"This independently-produced film, done just after ALL ABOUT EVE, exercises a kind of lurid fascination for Bette Davis's fans because even though the part of Margaret Elliot was written for Joan Crawford, and supposedly based on Crawford, the feeling that Davis is in many ways playing herself as a washed-up star in the early 50s is pretty hard to shake. Davis is as nervily amazing as always, but the production is pretty dismal: it was all done pretty much on the cheap, and the other actors (particularly Sterling Hayden as her stolid love interest) are so pallid compared to her that she might as well be acting alone on the screen. It's not even much fun as camp--it's only of interest because you get to see Bette Davis."
5,History Buffs,"Have you ever wondered ""HOW"" the US Navy was able to recover so quickly after Pearlon 7 December 1941 - You have to read this book !"
5,Riverdales,"The Riverdales not only strom the streets,but storm the world as well!Another Great effort by this amazing band.Each track confronts you like a blitzkrieg.Ramones like music and songs come at you one after another.This band never fails to give it their all.Every track is a true gem.Do yourself a favor and check out their entire catalog.Absolutley fantastic music!!A+++++"
1,Product not as good as description,"I bought several large Ginseng for my family members in China. However, on the cover of the boxes, there were no description of the size, and the ginseng in the boxes looked really small. I would not recommend buyers to consider this mechant for ginseng."
3,for advanced image editing,"What a brilliant exploration of the LAB color space! It provides a great deal of background for those doing advanced image editing. Yet, ultimately, it provides only a few gems that can be applied on a day to day basis. Despite that comment I do recommend it for those desiring to stretch themselves in the fine art of image reproduction."
4,Recommended,"I read (studied) this valuable book several weeks before. It is definitely worth buying it.I would not recommend it for first time Photoshop users, it is a high level technical book that requires some previous experience with the software.The techniques described are unexpected for anyone who has not used previously LAB mode, they are all very useful and practical.I would suggest a more structured style and less colloquial, with less long blocks of texts and more summaries.His introduction to LAB could be done with less words, faster and more precise using the language of Cartesian coordinates.This book is recommended for all serious digital photographers, it is oriented primarily for technical and advertising photographers although artist photographers could as well derive very interesting insights valuable for their work."
5,Essential professional reading,"As usual, Mr Margulis deals directly with very high-level knowledge which can be indispensible to professional Photoshop users. This is NOT a book for the casual user or the complacent professional. Some of the material, as he promises, is not easy to wrap your mind around & requires repeated, devoted attempts to understand. Other parts cover more familiar territory. The time one invests will be rewarded."
2,Out-of-date,"Right off the bat, I find instructions in chapter 1 don't apply to Photoshop CS4. It's really frustrating to follow something that's written for earlier versions of Photoshop. Publisher's are doing a big disservice to us by not pulling out-of-date books off the market."
5,Photoshop LAB Color,"This book, by Dan Margus, is the finest book of it's kind I have read. It's everything you wanted to know about color separation and was afraid to ask. A tad far out in some places, but I find this to be Dan's writing style. I wanted to go a step or two further than just RGB color separating, and this book fills the bill. It is the best seller in it's class, and I can understand why."
4,Excellent instructional book,Very unique way of presentation with a beginner section and expert section in first few chapters. I enjoyed the explanations as to why certain processes are superior and yield different results than what I am used to.
4,Serious stuff,"Awesome book. Don't buy it unless you're serious about your Photoshop. Not for the faint hearted, this really gets into technical details."
2,Doesnt cut to the chase.,"This book is a good one......I guess. The reason why I am not sure is that I have had this book for over a year now and I still havent managed to read it completely. Everytime I start reading it, it loses my interest after the third chapter. The authour would have been happier writing poetry about the LAB colour space. He keeps ranting on and on and on about the LAB colour space but when it comes to actually teaching you something new he does it in less than half the pages of the book. It gets to the point where the reader just goes - Ok, LAB is THE colour space to work in, now would you please stop telling me that after every other paragraph? Too much uselss information and very less practical knowledge."
5,This book will change your life!,"I can't believe I'm just now learning about this color space. It is easily the most powerful tool in Photoshop. Yet in all the hundreds of books, and thousands of articles and tutorials about Photoshop, LAB is rarely mentioned. Try removing the color cast from a forty year old color negative scan in RGB or CMYK... In LAB, no problem!!! This book by Dan Margulis, although a little wordy in places, is the most amazing Photoshop revelation on earth! An absolute jewel of a book. Way under-priced."
5,Indispensable image correction insight,"This remarkable book about image correction using the LAB color space in Photoshop has the unusual virtue of opening new doors for those just beyond beginners as well for the most advanced user in the field of pre-press, graphic arts and digital photography."
5,Photoshop LAB Color,Dan Margulis always writes well and this book in no exception. The book is loaded with information and has made the arcane subject of LAB color a lot clearer to me. I was able to see a vast improvement in my work after reading just the first chapter. The book is presented so that each concept is simply explained and also treated in depth. There is a gold mine of information for all photo retouchers. The first photo you work on will easily pay the cost of the book. I heartily recommend it.
2,Not my cup of tea,"If you want blind bedrock fundamentalism, then this one might be just what you want. It's not quite as inane as some programs (see the so called ""Truth Project""),but leave your thinking cap at home. Most of the ""Purpose-Driven"" brand has tried to stay ""mainstream,"" but the hard core right seems to permeate these ""Truths."" And yes, there is some good stuff, I'm just not comfortable with where it seems to come from."
5,Second time through just as educational,"Excellent resource for new believers as well as a great refresher (and eye-opener) for long-time believers. Kay Warren is very engaging in her DVD presentation as is Tom Holladay, her co-teacher."
5,excellent buying experience,"whatever I buy from Amazon.com,I know I will be completely satisfied. The items when delivered are actualy more what you expected. they are properly packed and always arrived way ahead of schedule. I love buying at Amazon.com."
2,Average at best. No pep. No life. This is ska?,Their best song 'The Bell Tower' is on a CD called Steady Sounds from the Underground. Buy that and hear a lot of other great bands
1,Will not melt solder after 2 months!,"I have been using the lower end Weller soldering irons for thirty years and in that time have worn two of them out. The last being Weller SP23L which has lasted around twelve years of moderate use.I decided to order a nicer iron this time as I am doing more guitar repair and building effect pedals. The last few times I have tried to use the WP25 it would not get hot enough to melt the solder! I understand a component may fail unusually early considering the large numbers the company must make. What does bother me is I have been emailing the company trying to get a replacement and they have not responded! Amazon will not help as it is over the thirty day limit.I am sure the other reviewers have had no problems, but just know that if you do buy one and it goes bad you are SOL!"
2,Underpowered,"This iron is very weak. Takes a very long time to heat up, and takes a long time to melt solder. It's difficult to work with this because it doesn't heat up the entire joint. Other than being pathetically weak, it seems well made. Get the 35W version."
4,Miss the Jamaican Woman,"This is a womderful CD! The only flaw (and it is a big one) is in the exclusion of the story of Jamaican Woman & The Old Raisin (Which you have to se the video for). Other than that, I highly recommend the CD!"
3,Funny? Yes and no,"This Cd started out fine but I quickly found myself wondering why Ms. Goldberg had to throw in a social commentary in every skit she did. For example, Fontaine at the beginning was really funny but when she started on her visit to the house of Ann Frank, well it got to be a bit overdone and the humour disappeared all together. Some things were not made for comedy. I can see where she was going, but if this is suppose to be a comedy album it wasn't very funny. Surfer chick was the best, cripple lady, dull and predictable and little girl sheer nonsense. After finally getting this Cd I was somewhat disappointed. Here is my personal rating based on chocolate bars and barf bags. 5 chocolate bars is tops while 5 barf bags, well don't even bother with it. So in the end I rate this Cd, 2 chocolate bars with a mild recommendation."
3,It helps to be British,"This is an account of the Falkland Island invasion of April 1, 1982 by Argentine troops. It's mildly interesting, in large part because of the ever-arresting presence of Richardson and the convincing acting by old pro Rosemary Leach. But the film has major flaws. The opening ten minutes are puzzling, as the plot is not at all clear and some of the characters cannot be understood. The invasion scenes show several thousand rounds of bullets being fired with only one person killed. Several of the minor characters in the story, such as the two people manning a radio station, never quite come to life.The larger point of the film is British chauvinism. After the fall of the town, the whole point of the film, news clips appear for a minute or two at the end showing live footage of the British reconquest of the tiny islands. There's Margaret Thatcher and the flag and the music... It helps to be British to enjoy this minor television film."
2,How to dress dancers: how do you dress dancers?,"I went to the library to get this book out when I needed to make costumes for my daughters dance recital. It was an amatuer production of Swan Lake; so I needed some help making the classical tutus. Unfortunately, the book hrdly helped at all. The pictures and/or instructions were very hard to understand, and Iam no oaf so I do understand a lot. But this? I didn't understand at all. They did have some very nice ideas for costumes, I thought."
1,This power source stinks,I purchased this power source since I figured that you did not need to spend much money on these since they are all pretty reliable .... WRONG... This thing overheated and died within 4 months. Would not recommend purchasing. Spend a little extra and get something reliable. It's not worth the effort of hooking and unhooking all of the necessary connectors more than once.
3,For devoted fans of this genre/era of writing.,"McCoy's book tells a very familiar story (I imagine it was already a pretty well worn tale even when this was first published): small town person travels to big city to make it big; small town person becomes corrupted by the amoral city; small town person survives (or doesn't) and lessons are learned. It's a fun read, especially if you enjoy the hard boiled lit of this era. The big fault is that it just hasn't aged well. Parts of it are very funny when they shouldn't be at all. Compare that to something like Hammett's The Thin Man, which holds up all these years later and is still funny when it's supposed to be."
2,Depraved,"I had this book for a grad school class, and it's one of the program's only clunkers. An especially surprising choice for a Christian college, it posits a trend away from traditional employment that may or may not exists, and asks the reader to buy into it wholeheartedly or get left behind. It also asks the reader to narcissistically pursue happiness in one's career to the exclusion of other considerations. Bad, bad, bad."
3,Not as great as I had hoped,I like my erotic to the point. Some of these stories D - R - A - G on before you get to any hot stuff. Even then some of it is just glanced over and nothing real hard core. I was hoping for more.
4,I've had good luck with this tool,"My wife bought this for me as a present last year, and I just didn't have a chance to use it until recently. We used it to hang a few dozen photographs and captions on a gallery wall, and it performed well. Though I was dubious that the sticky, double sided strips that came with the level would be effective, they held the thing on the wall all day and left no damage despite frequent application and removal. I have now used it on a vinyl wallpaper surface and on painted drywall, with equally good results. One thing to note - when they say this model only projects a beam for 15', they aren't kidding. The beam is also not as bright as I would have liked it to be, but hey - when a tool this useful costs under $20..."
2,Wall damage,"The first time I put it up on the wall it didn't stick well enough and plummeted down to the floor. Second time around, I pressed it a little harder on the wall and it stuck. Unfortunately, when I was finished, it took a nice big chunk of paint off with it."
2,Caution 3M Command Strips Damage,"The claim that 3M Command Strips (included) leave surfaces unscathed when removed, didnt work for me. Not on plaster board. It was attached for only 10 min and when removed, it took a piece of the paint and board with it. Not recommended."
1,Not level,"The vertical line is level put the horizontal line is slightly crooked. I have tried it on several horizontal lines that I know to be level. I don't know if mine is defective or what, but what value is a level that creates crooked lines?"
2,Not a great product,"While having a laser level is an outstanding idea for any job, this is not the product to choose. There are two major problems with this product:(1) The level does NOT stick to the wall very effectively, and getting it stuck to the wall initially can at times mess up the location that you want to project the laser line at.(2) The laser level itself is not very usable. The laser has issues with level tilt and orientation. Also, if the level is not stuck to the wall 100%, the laser will invariably move."
2,Hiding in the shadow of Chomsky's credibility,"Many opportunists like Finkelstein claim the affinity of their views to Chomsky's, and wrongly so. Chomsky, however misguided and torn from the real life in his idealism, is honest. Finkelstein and the likes distort the facts at will. Chomsky, like him or not, personifies one of the best Jewish (not only Jewish, of course) traits: compassion. Finkelstein, IMO, just hates Jewish community. This type of self-hating Jew is more common that we would wish, created by millennia of despisal.For balanced view, I suggest Shoher's Samson Blinded: A Machiavellian Perspective on the Middle East Conflict. Shoher is also very critical of Israel, but rationally and lovingly so."
1,Horrendous,"This man should be ostracized academically. He has the right to say what he wants, but it should be void of any academic legitimacy."
2,Barely legible,"Finkelstein's book is nothing more than a character attack on Alan Dershowitz's ""The Case for Israel."" And it is only that. Furthermore it is poorly written, to say the least it is barely legible, sentences are endless, quotes are everywhere, syntax is pretentious, it seems that the author wants to prove how cultivated and smart he is. But the try is vain, boring and not conclusive. As for the goal of dicrediting Dershowitz's book it is globally attained but the whole reading is so painful that in the end a small lingering doubt subsists. I do not recommand this book."
1,Ugh,"Finkelstein's book is an unreadable and boring series of appendices, all of which assume that the reader will not check the sources."
1,Finkelstein vs. Chomsky,"This reads like a thesis. Almost every paragraph starts with why Chomsky, another professor at a prestigious university, is wrong.I couldn't stand it."
3,an attempt at analysis,"this is an attempt at honest analysis of this issue.however,the various author are so angry at each other that often are moreattent at respond to each other and the objectivity suffers.this does not mean to imply that this particular book is misleading. it tries very hard to be impartial and it almost often succeeds"
5,Love reading Finkelstein.,"I have had this book delivered for a while now, but sadly, did not mange to read it yet.Never mind, Finkelstein work never let me down so far."
4,interesting reading,I think people should read this book to9 get a better understanding of anti-semitism that still exists and continues to grow!
1,"Should have the ""6"" removed from the title...","Where's the info about webservices? SNAP Technologies? Cross platform development? This book is okay for general Delphi development, but has practically nothing to do with version SIX of Delphi."
2,Misleading,"This is not Delphi 6 book. There's almost nothing on new features of Delphi 6 (CLX, DBExpress etc); this is not Delphi reference book, it doesn't cover everything in VCL. Basically, book is covering much of Object Pascal and VCL but not deeply and teaching good programming practices with Delphi. It could be useful for beginners and only somehow interesting for experienced programmers. If price is more reasonable and title isn't misleading, I would give 4 stars."
2,Who is this book for?,"...at least [I] did not pay full price for this book. The problem with this book is that it doesn't seem to have a target audience. It's not a beginner's book (I am a beginner at Dephi for the record), and it also does not have the level of detail for the experienced Delphi programmer that the other books I have seen in bookstore address. Do youself a favor and skip this one. Mastering Delphi 6 is a good one from what I was able to skip at the bookstore, and I have yet to find an updated beginner's book for Delphi 6."
2,NOT Delphi 6,"I bought this book and I returned this book. With no mention of Biz Snap, Web Snap, etc., you feel very deceived. He should have waited another month or two and made it a real Delphi 6 book."
5,Amy Jayne's on stage performance is outstanding.,"I spent Sunday November 7, 1999 with Amy Jayne and her husband. I saw her performance and everyone was in awe. She was the most talked about performer. Amy Jayne definitely got the attention of the people that did not know her. I have her music and my whole family enjoys it. Everyone loves her music from my teenage daughter to me and my husband. I look forward to seeing Amy Jayne again and getting more of her music."
4,A lot of joy,"I haven't heard much so called Nashville sound, but if it goes like this, it must be great! I've seen Amy-Jayne once on stage and I really enjoyed her singing songs of her CD. Most of all I like that ""bluesy"" sound of some songs. Brilliant! Entertaining!"
4,very complete for a travel guide,"Very usefull for planning our camping trip to Joshua tree National park. very complete for a travel guide, good maps and pictures"
5,Great read,"If your READING THIS then your planing on going to Joshua Tree and this is the book. It is easy to read pack full of information but not overloaded, it includesfacts environmental conditions, stories of the settlers, and a very good description of the trails. I have read a couple of different book on this area and this is far superior.Hey had a great time in Palm Springs and I used this book while I was at Josuha Tree. The book was on the money very awesome, there is only one thing that has changed if you want to visit the Keys Ranch it is by appointment only the phone number is in the book and you have to do this before entering into Joshua tree because there is no Cell service. Other then that the book is very accurate it was well worth it."
2,"They went cheap, printed in China","Information wise, the book is pretty good. Informative with nice pictures. I bought the book for a recent trip to Joshua Tree. The cover literally came unbound the first day of looking through the book. We all know why companies decide to print overseas. It's a pity, too. I would have gladly paid a bit more for a ""local"" product."
5,Joshua tree lovers rejoice,Highly informative and entertaining guide to the mojave desert park. It really provides a good overview of the flora and fauna as well as some of the history behind the park. Beautiful pictures and maps. Highly recommend!
3,Occurence location guide for Sonoron birds,"Make sure your expectations are set right for this valuable book. Like Monson's ""Annotated Guide to the Birds of Arizona"" -- this book focusses on the occurence and location of bird sightings in Sonora. Valuable for determining the frequency and location of birds in Sonora, but no details on actual sites. NOT a Lane guide to Sonora by any means. Nor does it have any photos, descriptions, etc. My interest is the 'south of the border' occurence of Arizona vagrants, casuals, etc."
5,serious genius,"it's astounding that they would have let this little boy with otherworldly jazz riffs and touchingly sincere sentiments run loose like this on his debut recording. a clear example of right place right time good luck.every track is chilling, and very different. roddy piles on the maj7 chords and sings like he doesn't realize he's sometimes out of tune, and with more soul than a brit white boy should be expected to have. this album also does without the gloss which makes later works not necessarily lesser, but certainly different.really one of the best albums ever."
5,Lovely and accurate!,"This is an excellent panorama of costumes representing Colonial and Early American Fashions, including nobility, servant, officer, pirate and more. The detail is beautiful, and careful research is obvious here. Tom Tierney can do no wrong!For classroom use, homeschoolers, or adults fascinated with the everyday details of people's lives throughout history, I strongly recommend this book. Beautiful!"
5,another of Tom Tierney's great historical books,"My 12-year-old daughter loves Tom Tierney's coloring books. She loves the beautiful artwork and the details in the drawings. I like them for the historical information she learns in reading about the fashions. Also, his description of what the historical fashions would have looked like encourages her to put together colors she might not have considered. These are such favorites with my daughter and granddaughter that my daughter requested copies of the ones she had already colored so that she could do them again."
5,sometimes stars hibernate under a pillow,"I was extremely fortunate to discover this rare translation by Keith Waldrop in a used book store. Written as a collaboration between Andre Breton, Rene Char and Paul Eluard in a span of five days on a drive through the country side, this is a beautiful gem that deserves more attention.Concise words, images dance magical:I will remove my shouldersEach step provokes a misfortuneTo be lost in the vast of my temples"
3,Good but not great,"Limp's first album is very catchy but just not enough substance. Later they would show a little more lyrical and musical aggression. It's a good album though with some stand out songs, Far away,Bug Dance and a cover of the great National Lampoon's vacation theme song Holiday Road. Good pop-punk probably better than any mainstream pop-punk bands except for maybe Green Day."
3,Paul Nesbit's Longs Peak : Its Story and a Climbing Guide,"This is a nice brief book on some of the historical aspects of Long's as well as some climbing information. The good news is that this book is so thin you can take it with you on a backpacking trek. The bad news is that because it's so small, it contains limited information, hence the 3 star rating. Overall the book is very interesting and informative about Long's Peak. For a first time visitor to the mountain, this would be a good book to purchase."
5,Glad I paid $40.,"Friends; I have finished a new book, ""The Sorrows of the Quaker Jesus; James Nayler and the Puritan Crackdown on the free Spirit"", by Leo Damrosch, Prof of Literature, Harvard. One of Prof. Damrosch's main interests is the Puritan reaction to Quakers, to do this he develops, as background, a description of mid-17th Century Quakerism. I wish he had done as well for Puritanism. Another interest is the shoddy treatment Nayler received from Parliament (which really had no business dealing with Nayler, but since there was no Constitution, who is to say) and the shoddy (but different) treatment Nayler received from G. Fox and other Quakers. Since Damrosch is not trying to ""convince"" to Qism this was a refreshing treatment for me. He has worked with a concordance to find the Biblical allusions of Quaker speech and writing to fair success, missing only a few important ones. University presses are pricey, this is $40, but I am glad I paid the price. Joseph H. Condon, Engineer, Quaker"
2,More focus on Medium Format please!,"Ernst Wildi's book was quite a disappointment to me, as the title made me believe, that it would be a competent appraisal of the different formats and a recommandation of fields of photography where the size of medium format would win the game. But after a couple of chapters concerned with different formats, cropping and camera types the rest is just an ordinary photography primer with really no news. Additionally the illustrations are often handdrawn and really not of the quality you would expect to find in a book like this.I feel seriously misguided by the title and wonder if I dare order the other wellknown Ernst Wildi title on a specific medium format brand..."
4,Wildi is conservative but makes his point,"I am a big Ernst Wildi fan! That said, some observations should be noted: Wildi writes lucidly, logically, and tries to teach the reader in every one of his works. His photography is excellent and he really does not hide the fact he is a Hasselblad guru! Perhaps, he assumes that some of his points that are written and diagrammed to demonstrate, are obvious to all readers, and does not go into great depth. Yes, I got it! People wanting more from Ernst on techniques should check out his book, ""Achieving the Ultimate Image."" These 2 works could have been combined into one; re-titled ""The Ultimate Image in Medium Format"" or similar."
5,"If you like Pantera, White Zombie, NIN... you'll love this!","Hearing the cd for the first time was an experience one will never forget. It will be a regular rotation in you disc player. Substance D is what pure, heavy music is all about. It's good to know there are bands out there who still care about the way it sounds! Keep it up guys and let the fans know how to reach you or get more info on your shows!"
4,Jennings Family,Like the book even though there isn't much on our Jennings family. Looks like there could be a book that followed this one that might have more on our family.
5,Wonderful book,"I discovered this book by coincidence during a holiday in Helsinki some ten years ago. It is hard to describe why, but, since then, it has been one of my favorite car books. The story, the way how it is written, the pictures... all together make it a pleasure to read. Not so many technical details, but all about the ""life of a car""... and not just any car, but the ""iconic"" E-type!"
3,Interesting read.,"This book is the story of the press car in many of the photos (9600 HP) of the E-type, its life and subsequent restoration."
5,a lovely romp,"A lovely romp, filled with romance and adventure, wonderfully witty and wise by late 20th century standards in which achievement shares the same first letter with alcohol, friendship with futility, decision-making with determined demise. If Jernigan isn't everyman, if his punishment is not based on being born to wrestle with God, who is."
3,Very readable but equally derivative,"If you enjoy the first several pages (which are available here on Amazon.com), then you'll probably enjoy the whole book. I certainly did. But it's no masterpiece. Instead, it's blatantly derivative in substance, and to a lesser extent style, of any number of better books. One of the finer blurbing ironies I've seen is the rave on the back cover of this book by Frederick Exley, who wrote one of those better books, A Fan's Notes. I guess Exley was as susceptible as any of us to the sincerest form of flattery. See also Richard Ford, John Cheever, and even Malcolm Lowry."
4,Smart & Funky,"Trombonist Mark McGrain leads a deep-groove quarter (bone, tuba, bass, drums) where everyone plays both rhythm & lead. Bob Moses is of course a great composer/arranger/visionary in his own right; and Marcus Rojas has played in Henry Threadgill's bands, so he knows the avant-funk, too. The sum is a combination of danceable groove with very intelligent soloing, and the sound is unbeatable -- especially if you like living in that low-rumble bass world."
2,Item does not match the photo,"I haven't used it yet, so I will wait to update the review once I do. However, the item just arrived and it looks nothing like the picture! There is no box at all! The filter arrived without any wrapper at all, just placed inside a envelope. I have no idea if it is new or if it was used, no instructions, no name even. Nothing. The seller has a picture up of a box which is not what you will get."
5,If you need a good refill...,I have a Vicks non-mist humidifier and it is rocking. Amazon had the lowest prices I could find for the filter refill's. They have metal on them which makes them sit pretty snug. Very good.
3,It's a filter,The filter did give off an unpleasent odor in the first couple of uses. Otherwise it seems to work fine.
3,Good product; didn't expect it not to come in the box or packaged at all,"The two filters were not packaged in plastic or a box, which I thought was strange. However, they work good."
1,messege,"When I ordered this product one year ago first time , I got filter into box, like shows on the picturies . But now , when I ordered again, I got 3 filters with out boxes, only into plastic bag. Alluminium screen around filters was demiged , because plastic is not protect them."
3,You get what you pay for,"I was looking for a less-expensive version of the filters for my son's nursery humidifier. They are not as good as the name brand and because they don't have the blue meshy outside lining, I find that the tank typically squashes the filter down...but they do the job. I will probably just go with the honeywell filters next time."
1,Manufacturing error,This DVD should be recalled: it appears that due to some manufacturing error it contains a different subject (Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe).
1,same thing happened to me...,"I also got the dvd of an african dictator. I watched the entire dvd, thinking 'maybe Ceausescu will be next' but that didn't happen. Cover says Ceausescu as well as the dvd."
4,For the price you cant beat this,Very lightweight and practical mess kit. I have had mine for about 6months and have used it for various trips. Since then my wife has gotten one so we may cook two different meals on the trail. The kit is made out of very light aluminum and care should be taken when using it or you may dent it. The surface isn't non-stick but so far I haven't had any problems with food getting burnt into the pan. We dehydrate meals for the trail and the included pot is the perfect size for an individual portion. I wouldn't recommend using the mug for hot beverages since its all aluminum and will burn your hands.At this price point if I get just another 6 months out of it I would be happy.
2,You get what you pay for....,"Coleman has been outsourcing most of their stuff to China, and it shows. This crap will get you through one or two weeks, perhaps, if you keep pushing the dents out and don't punch a hole in it. I am going to be looking for a better mess kit to put in my ruck."
4,It is what it is.,"This little cook set will get the job done for 1 person at a time. Dont buy it expecting to feed more than a couple people at best.Remember what you are shopping for, a cheap cook set that will get the job done when you need it.Advice: The little skillet fits perfect on a #10 hobo stove. If you don't know what that is then Youtube it.Overall I'm happy with what I paid and what I got. Shipping could have been lower (hint hint)"
5,Worth owning for much re-visiting,"For consistency of tone, measured pace, and assured craft, this is a very fine film. I think of the word EXQUISITE. I think of the word LOVE. I think of the word FRANCE. I remember some lines from this film -There is no such thing as love, just the proof of love-To own and revisit and so to be reminded of what the best of cinema has to offer."
2,Disappointing Transfer,"As it was stated by another reviewer, the Criterion transfer of ""Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne"" is quite disappointing. The film seems loose in the gate and therefore the picture is very instable; it's jumping a lot, which is very irritating. Also, there is some noise present in the background.So although Criterion did clean up the print quite much, this effort is in vain due to the imperfect transfer. I wonder why nobody has noticed this at Criterion? And its a problem which could have been corrected quite easily....Considering the high price Criterion asks for this title: don't buy it!"
4,The Violent Femmes Only Great Work....,"is what I have heard from fans. I can see how music followed through with the Violent Femmes formula could get full of filler after treading the same path album after album. But with this album I would have to say singer Gordon Gano was a winner and a great winner at that. Gano is obviously and angry guy that can't get over whatever pain he feels. I think that is what makes this music entertaining, plus the folksy punk flavor. Songs like Add It Up and Blister In The Sun show the Femmes at their most poppy but I think their real strength comes in when Gano gets angry with songs like Gone Daddy Gone, Ugly, and Gimme The Car. This is definitely the most entertaining and defining work of theirs and worth many a listen, even if nothing else of theirs is."
2,The volume of these ripped mp3s are too low,"If you preview all Violent Femmes mp3s, you'll notice that the songs from the album Violent Femmes are much lower than the other albums. Amazon should re-rip this CD."
4,Not 5 stars.,Not a great musical triumph by any means. I like quirky music with heart. I also like the artist to have some musical ability. The Femmes may have it all but I didn't hear it..........The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 2 was out of respect for those who love this album and do GET IT and the fact I could be wrong. Honestly I found most of it difficult to listen to unlike say the Flaming Lips which I do GET.
5,Can I Give It 10 Stars?,"Incredible, awesome, powerful, raw, emotional, lewd, GREAT!This is without a doubt one of the greatest albums of all time. I've had it for 17 years now and still love it as much today as the day I bought it."
5,"UM, HI! GUESS WHAT? what? THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM I OWN","I was 4 years old when this the Violent Fems emerged about 2000 miles east of me; but I could feel their rthyms, beats and lyrics as clear as mud. I am now 20, and have enjoyed listening to this CD for 16 years; especially on my way to work in the morning in the I-405 stop and go! Add it Up, everyone, ADD IT UP!"
5,the Catcher in the Rye of Rock and Roll,"I remember picking up the cassette of this when it first came out and going for a ride in the car to give it a listen. By the time I got around to playing it for the second time, I was singing along to the songs like they had been decade old classics. The Violent Feemes had struck gold on their first release. A band in 1983 that played mostly acoustic instuments like upright bass, xylaphone and trash can drums was quite rare, and to do so with more passion than any of the current hardcore punk bands was shocking. Gordon Gano filtered Holden Caulfield through Lou Reed with a touch of Jonathon Richman, to create teen angst classics for that time, and times to come. The Femmes would falter after the release of their second album Hallowed Ground and would perhaps be forgotten as mere footnotes if not for their first album. In some ways this became the Dark Side of the Moon for the eighties generation. Enjoy it."
3,Naiive Folk/Rock Music,"God, I hate this group with a passion! Those whiney, rudely sung vocals sound like the Talking Heads if David Byrne had never managed to find a good rhythm section. That guy on snare drum DOES keep pretty good time. But the whole minimal schtick is just that...schtick. Some interesting songs, so I'll give this one 3 stars. But the lazy, emotionally draining style? Yech!"
5,the greatest,"In my opinion, this is one of the best cds of the 80's. If you've never owned a Violent Femmes album, this is definitely the one to start with!"
5,One Album Wonders,"Violent Femmes only made one good album, but what a great album it is! The sound and attitude are absolutely unique and combine with a batch of great songs to make for a thoroughly enjoyable album. It is filled with classic songs, including ""Blister in the Sun,"" ""Add it Up,"" ""Please Do Not Go,"" ""Kiss Off,"" Gone Daddy Gone,"" and ""Good Feeling."" A pure blast of post-punk pleasure, it is the one Femmes album that qualifies as a must-own."
5,Damn fine album,"Really brilliant, this album is such a huge landmark in the development of folk-punk and american rock in general. Such a damn young spirit to it."
3,It works but..,"I just buy two of these bulbs, but they weren't what i expected because they didn't fit to my sony video lamp, and have warm light when i need white light."
1,JUST LOOKS GOOD--THAT'S IT...,I BOUGHT THIS GARBAGE FOR MY SON DURING CHRISTMAS---AND LIKE THE OTHER MOSSIMO WATCH I HAD THAT BROKE--SAME HAPPEN...IN THE GARBAGE...AVOID MOSSIMO--YOU PAY WHAT YOU GET FOR.....DON'T WASTE YOUR GAS MONEY..
1,"Worked once, smells like it's burning up.","DVD player worked the first time I used it. After that it no longer reads any discs. It is also extremely hot and smells like it's burning up inside. It'll be in the e-waste pile on the next trip. Don't waste a little money on a Coby, spend more money wisely on something else."
1,Waffles the DVD,"About five minutes in the DVD the sound ends and the picture breaks in sections, and acccording to my repairman the bushings are worn to create the waffles to ooperate the DVD I have to stand it on it sides so it will work"
2,doesnt play all CD's,the product doesnt seem to play all CD's for some reason.especially home cut CD's
3,Great Story.... Great Acting By Cast Members....,"I think this movie has a great message as to how one politician, almost singlehandedly, made a difference in bringing the cold war to an end in Afghanistan. It is a feel good movie in this regard that one person can trult make a difference if they try hard enough.Charlie Wilson wanted schools built in Afghanistan to educate the country's youth once the war was over. In fact, 50% of the population was under the age of 14 years old according to the stats in the movie. Wilson attempted to have congress provide the 1 million dollars to start the building of schools, but congress didn't go for it.The cons about this movie were that it felt a bit rushed at points, but otherwise a good movie."
4,Witty dialog,"The dialog in the movie was the best part of the movie. Hoffman and Hanks traded quips so fast it took me a second to realize the coolness of the insults. They developed a respect for each other because they had a common goal of saving the lives of the Afghans. The Wilson meeting with the Pakistan president and president's advisors was hilarious. The sport of bull baiting came to mind. The movie addressed the real cost of diplomacy in terms of human lives. The slow bleed strategy of the current CIA operatives was costing lives. Charlie's goal was simple: he wanted to stop the Soviet helicopters from killing innocents.All the acting was excellent. Hanks, Hoffman, and Roberts turned in fine performances. Although the dialog sparkled more than the sexual heat between Hanks and Roberts. The story had a light touch considering the seriousness of the topic. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
5,Joanne Herring,A very good movie. If you read a mini biography of Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) it will put things in a better prespective.Chuck
2,Sent Wrong DVD Format,"Great film; however I received an incorrectly formatted product. I actually paid significantly more for a Widescreen Version, but instead received a Full Screen DVD with a label from Jamesport General Store that said 'Widescreen.' It is not Widescreen, and it will cost more money to return the DVD and exchange it, than to simply keep the incorrect DVD. Having Said that; it is a brilliant film with a subtly poignant blend of dark humor and a more palpable romanticism. A Smart, versatile, witty and understated performance from Hoffman. Two thumbs up - And I'm keeping one finger full-screen."
4,Enlightening,"Could have been X rated. Hate to believe the conduct depicted is common among our Congressional representatives, but I'm not going to kid myself. True? Who knows. Should have waited for Blu-Ray version."
3,How liberals fight wars,"This is a film made by liberals for liberals who want to feel patriotic about fighting the last war. It should be noted that, at that time, most liberals were as squeamish about confronting soviet aggression as they are about confronting the Jihadists today. Ironically the actors, writer and director who made this film are uniformly liberal left and opposed to our Iraq policies, so it's hard to buy them as tough guys.There is also no mention of the fact that Reagan was the one who approved those ever-increasing budgets.Kudos should go to Congressman Charlie Wilson, one of a vanished breed of Democrat who took freedom and the need to protect it seriously enough to actually fight for it. The only one left today seems to be Joe Liebermann."
2,Most Cynical Movie of 2007,"What a monumental waste of talent, time, and energy. Everyone collects their checks here for nothing more than boiler plate work. I'm being generous with 2 stars. Not one redeemable character in the bunch (supposedly based on a true story) makes one very sad at such a waste of film stock - has it really come to this? No wonder the Middle East hates the West so much - this film does nothing but reinforce the cynicism and lowest common denominator mentality (of which it purports to represent)! Yuck!"
2,Waste of money,Hoffman almost pulls this one out but not quite. The use of foul language and nudity to help it didn't! Hanks and Roberts are capable of outstanding performances; these aren't among them. A great story poorly presented. Save your money.
1,Hollywood baloney,"Couldn't tolerate more than 30 minutes of this Hollywood baloney. Every character I saw, from Hanks' Wilson, to Julia Roberts' Houston socialite, to the CIA operative played by Hoffman -- ludicrously over-acted. As if anybody at Langley could have gotten away with smashing a glass wall twice and prancing out (without police escort). As if everybody in 1980 D.C. used the F-word as their favorite adjective (or verb). It was ridiculous."
1,15 minutes are missing from this DVD,"Having seen this film in the theater, I was very disappointed to discover several scenes were cut from the DVD version, including one crucial one. The most crucial cut concerned the fact that President Reagan's approval was what released the Stinger missile to the Afghans.Also cut were scenes: Charlie Wilson was sick in the Hospital; his re-elction effort; testing an ineffective missile in Egypt; any more? Anybody know why?(I also suspect that The Princess Bride now currently shown is missing an early scene that was in the theater version, but I can't confirm this.)"
1,Super up-to-date workings of our government,One never hears much about the events leading to the Afghanistan situation where many of our miltary people are involved. It also brings out why we win so many military victories but lose the aftermaths. I hope that the lesson here resonates with everyone.
1,"Shallow Pro-War, Kill-The-Ruskies Propaganda","This is a film John Wayne would have loved. If your idea of fun is watching Russians being blown up, you'll have a good time. If you don't think war is the loftiest pursuit in which mankind can engage, this film may leave you feeling a little sick to your stomach."
4,"Clever, enjoyable, cautionary","I left a star off because helping the Mujahadeen drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan couldn't have been as easy as it's portrayed here. ""Charlie Wilson's War"" reminds me that before ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Philadelphia,"" Tom Hanks was a comic actor. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant as Gust. Best Julia Roberts performance since ""Erin Brockovich."" Pay careful attention to the last few minutes. After a great victory, something's changing, and not in a good way."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Charlie Wilson's War has an impeccable pedigree, but with its uninvolving plot (does the audience really care about Charlie or Gus or anyone else?) incredibly simplistic storyline (that essentially posits Charlie Wilson ""won"" the Cold War for America) and general forgettability, it's not much of a movie."
5,Film reviewers were right.,"i have been reading reviews about""Charlie Wilson's Wars""since it first came out in America and then in Europe..All of them were mostly positive.As I live in Spain,I knew it would take a long time before I could see it here ,and then it would be dubbed in spanish.On top Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks beeing among my favourite actors plus of course that we have also Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mike Nichols as dirctor(Imagine that I have seen him with Helen May in Detroit around 1960),I preordered it as soon as it was available in DVD.Well,I certainly was not disappointed.All the way through it is fun,witty,very believable.The action develops like a slow menacing tidal wave(for the russians)On top you discover the real Charlie Wilson as an adorable scoundrel on the surface, but deep down a serious dedicated and profoundly honnest man.You have no idea how much and often. I have recommended it.Bertrand Lewinson MD."
1,Naaa,"slow, nothing really that interesting. I must type more words here. Then some more here and again here. Don't rent this video."
4,"Love him or hate him, Charlie got things done!","I'm not usually a fan of political dramas but this film shows us that the system can work when the right people rally behind a cause. Charlie Wilson is depicted as a man with questionable ethics and ""character flaws"" but he was compassionate and always backed up his promises, which is rare for politicians today. Somehow, Charlie gets a million-dollar budget to grow into one billion!ddTI'd watch this movie again even if I'm not too keen on Julia Roberts as many seem to be."
3,Virile heterosexual liberal chick magnet beats the Commies,"CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR--a very good if incredibly crude film with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts about a Democrat congressman who resolves to help the Afghan people throw off the yoke of the Evil Communist empire. Except for the complete absence of Ronald Reagan whom apparently had nothing to do with fighting the Cold War in the 80s, this is quite a good film and history lession. Also has a cast of some of the hottest babes ever to grace a film about the fight against the red menace. Mike Nicholls--the director is apparently a rump man."
4,A very good movie...,I can't speak for how much of the movie was true to history but as movies go this was just a very good movie to sit back and watch- it kept things interesting and if you learned a little something along the way all the better.
2,"Overrated, Bad Casting","I was disappointed with this movie, but I guess I am in the minority. It was mainly due to the miscasting. Hanks and Roberts were not believable in their parts and I felt no chemistry between the two.Considering the subject matter, I was also hoping for something a little more serious instead of a Hollywood ""feel good movie."" It is a shame that most people learn their history from Hollywood movies.However, Hoffman's performance did make the movie worth watching. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it but if it happened to come on cable and there was nothing else on..."
2,Hanks and Roberts as folksy southrons?,"I wanted to like this movie. I wanted to love this movie. After all, how could you not like a movie about a tiny cadre of heros who singlehandedly bring down the mighty Soviet Empire?Unfortunately and in my humble opinion, the producers/directors of this film did a lousy job. Hanks as a folksy, womanizing Texas Congressman is an unconvincing characature. Roberts is better but not by a lot.The Congressional Committee chairman is quite a bit better and his addressing of a crowd of starving Afghans is a rare moment of sensitive, high-quality acting.Ron Braithwaite"
3,Nothing special,I did not find this film interesting. It was hard to understand if you are not American as the accents were hard to understand - and I am British!
3,History better than Hollywood,"It really is a fascinating story ... One man sees the opportunity to do what his government won't... arm/train a group of militants to fight an enemy who did the same to us for more than a decade in South East Asia. And in doing so handed the U.S.S.R its worst military defeat.Why we needed so much sex to sell this story, I don't know."
4,"MIKE NICHOLS, OPUS 20","***1/2 2007. Based on George Crile'sCharlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our Timesand directed by Mike Nichols. Academy award nomination for Hoffman and five Golden Globe nominations. Washington, 1980. A bored American congressman, enthralled by the Afghan war, tries to obtain secret funds in order to buy modern arms for the Afghan guerrilla warfare. I was a little surprised by some of the reviewers here which describe CHARLIE WILSON'S as if the film was a documentary or an accurate account of what really happened in the 80's. IT IS NOT. The movie is a funny satire of American morals in politics, that's all. Enjoy. Recommended."
3,Interesting take on history,"Another political movie that choses gloss over substance. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene that he's in and Julia Roberts rely on her southern roots to turn in a convincing Texas belle performance. Tom Hanks-eh. I wasn't too impressed, it seems like I've seen this character for him before. I didn't necessarily find this story all that compelling and it fails at being a character study because the change in our main character literally happens at a snap of a finger. Of course at the end everything is the U.S' fault and I guess somehow we should all be ashamed of ourselves in the end. For the most part, the film is just a notch above a snoozer-only because of Hoffman."
4,The best character was not Tom Hanks nor Julia Roberts,"Charlie Wilson's war is an enjoyable vehicle for making the point that someone can have a very flawed personal life, but still help humanity. I could tell Tom Hanks had a lot of fun playing the hard drinking, womanizing, Charlie Wilson. However, he didn't seem entirely comfortable in the role, which would have been more convincingly played by Michael Douglas or Jack Nicholson (although granted Nicholson's a bit too old for the role)--someone who is better at playing a womanizing jerk. And the camera man had a lot of fun with those gratuitous butt and cleavage shots. As far as the Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts characters are concerned, most of their best lines were in the trailer. The unsung hero of this movie is Phillip Seymour Hoffman (nominated for best supporting actor) playing a gruff, sarcastic, highly intelligent CIA agent. His character is hilarious, and IMO what really makes this movie."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"When I sat down to watch Charlie Wilson's War, I thought it would be a can't miss. A true story, covered up by the government, starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts!? How could that be bad!? Well, for a change, Tom Hanks isn't playing a likeable character. Charlie Wilson is portrayed as a sex addicted nut job, who follows his libido more than his brain. As for the film, it was just so confusing to me, they jump from scene to scene so quickly and introduce a ton of characters so fast, that by the time they got to Julia Roberts, I was already sick of the film. I didn't even get through the whole thing to be completely honest with you. It's an unbelievable cast and a pretty cool story, but I was not happy with the way the movie was done. It was not easy to sit through or follow."
2,Charlie Wilson's bore,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Hoffmann is arguably one of the best actors around at the moment, while the prospect of seeing Hanks and Roberts share some screen time, with Sorkin's writing thrown into the mix and Nichol's direction made the wait to see the movie worthwhile.And then i saw the film!! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.I generally find political movies quite boring. But having avidly watched The West Wing for years and thoroughly enjoying Mike Nichols previous political film 'Primary Colors', i was expecting great, witty things from this duo.Whilst there a couple of parts in the film i enjoyed, overall, i found myself looking at my watch wishing the film to finish.Overall, very disapointing and i would only recommend this to people who were having trouble sleeping. This is the perfect tonic.Oh, and a memo to Mr Hanks himself: Please keep your pants on in future yeah?"
4,Charlie Wilson's War,"This is a BRILLIANT movie. This is also a true story. The fact that it is true AND a great movie makes it even better.Charlie Wilson was a man who liked to drink, womanize and swear a lot. If you can get past that, you will also see he was a wonderful man with a HUGE heart. And you will be blown away by this movie.This movie entertains you. It makes you think. And then, in the end, it makes you cry."
4,very enjoyable,"Based on a true story (although overstating the importance) this movie is a short ,but not complete look at the Afghanistan war. Charlie Wilson had a role but certainly not as central as the movie implies. For a better perspective read ""Ghost Wars"" by Steve Coll. However the movie was fun to watch."
3,Tom's good minus best,"I guess a great actor like Tom Hanks may accept a movie roll considerably below his potential.This flick exposes that hazard. This is not a bad movie, however it just too restrictive on Hanks acting abilities. Would I buy it again? Flip a Coin !"
4,Entertaining movie is worth owning,"In a very entertaining way, this movie manages to educate the viewer on America's first war in Afghanistan. Indeed, the historical/political treatment is not heavy handed, but makes this more than just an entertaining movie about a colorful Congressman (and he is colorful). If you like movies that have some historical connection, but want something that's still light enough to show just for entertainment value, this movie is perfect. And, of course, Tom Hanks does a great job."
2,Boooooring,"Why why why would anyone publish an art history book with black and white pictures? I can understand black and white pictures capturing art from the renaissance or pieces destroyed in the world war...but I cannot lookout a Turner in black and white, really."
3,Honestly Done Right,I was impressed with the quality songs on this.The MadCaddies make this cd a four star mix. The other bands put good songs on this CD as well. This release is one of the better ones I have heard lately. This easily rivals those fat wreckord compilationsyou see in over abundance these days.
4,Great collection of Ska Punk tunes,"The bargain basement priced ""Honest Don's Welcome Wagon"" should be picked up by any of you out there who are looking for something new now that you've worn our your Goldfinger, Buck O Nine, Rancid and MM Bosstones CD's. Mostly a collection of emerging newcomers this complilation is much more consistent than punk comps tend to be.Awesome cover of Elton John's ""Rocket Man"" by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes is a highlight as are cuts by the Mad Caddies and Chixdiggit.Can't think of a better way to spend four bucks."
2,ho-hum travelogue,"My sister gave me this book as a Christmas present.I don't know what the excitement is all about.I found the narrative boring and rather snarky. Some of her descriptions about the Midwest and the river are very nice. Her description about interactions with the various towns and people struck me as elitist. I got tired of reading about meals - cooked on board or bought at restaurants - and showers.Most of all I was hoping for some kind of resolution to her feelings about her father - his death was, after all, the impetus for this trip. But there was nothing. We got a nice little slice of him as a man - then are left with nothing but her uncertainty regarding what to do with his ashes.Disappointing read. A waste of time for me."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I have read other books by Mary Morris and have always enjoyed them. So I was excited to find this one. This could have been a fascinating story; except that I as a reader lost my patience with the author very quickly. If I was a river runner and she was my passenger, I'd have thrown her out with the anchor. She obviously did not know what she was getting into, had a very naive view of what the journey would be like, and didn't seem to be learning much. She complained constantly and got too much into daily minutea. Tho I ended up not finishe it, topic still interests me, and I hope to find a better book about that journey soon."
1,Don't bother with this one.,"I have wasted my money on this video set. Please don't waste yours. The production quality is that of a junior high school class project. The sound comes and goes. The topics change abruptly, without sense. The tenth video, yes I watched them all, has no new material in it - it is entirely made up of clips from the previous nine worthless videos. You should pull this piece of trash from your shelves. It is an embarassment."
2,"Poor production, nothing new","Being a mafia buff, I was pleased to see a 10 TAPE series on the Italian mob. I was fairly disappointed when I got it home. The quality was quite poor (sound, picture, cinematography), plus I was hoping for some sort of narration to go along with it, but it was all comprised of low budget interviews.The tapes were very scattered and sporadic in their content and barely covered the topics they were supposed to and constantly went off topic. For example, the tape on Gotti barely scratched the surface concerning Gotti, and the next thing you know they are briefly talking about Japanese organized crime, like it was thrown in as an afterthought.Though there were a few interesting bits of information, there was nothing that my few mafia books didn't cover in more detail. Overall, a very disappointing series which could and should have been so much better."
2,A much weaker collection than the past,"I picked up this book, having thoroughly enjoyed the last 2 editions and was greatly disappointed by the story selection this year. In the past the selections have all had only one thing in common: they are some of the best pieces of ""writing"" in the past year. This year there seems to be a theme of nothing but depression. Story after story seems to be nothing but how bad life is and how there is nothing you can do to get around it. Reading this book is akin to watching French films all day then calling your mom and asking her ""whats wrong?"". The light at the end of the tunnel is a hilarious story from Sedaris about a rousing night of strip poker. Very funny stuff and is just about the only reason I give this book 2 stars."
2,Where are the truly overlooked gems?,"Not here...But, what do you expect from the man who only publishes his friends/lovers? Here, again, you'll find Eggers friends whose work he's published elsewhere, people Eggers knows at the Onion web site, etc. etc. This is a great idea for a Best American book, but sooner or later, McSweeney's is going to have to stop pretending to publish overlooked, outsider, experimental, or even good, work. Where can one really find that, I wonder..."
1,The Stooges must be turning over in their graves!,"Back in the eighties, there was an announcement of the production of a biographical movie on the lives of the Three Stooges. As a result, there was quite an extensive search for just the right persons to portray the comedic trio. Apparently, the search must have been fruitless because no movie was ever produced and released. Stoogemania must have been made in lieu of the one previously mentioned. What we have here is a dull, senseless comedy about a stooge ""addict"" who undergoes rehabilitation treatment at a fictitious clinic. There are many persons who physically resemble Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp, and Joe at this place and it is quite possible they may have all been candidates for the movie roles. Overall, the acting is lousy and the script is really ridiculous and not that funny. Even the many clips from the Three Stooges shorts inserted in this film don't help it a bit."
1,Stooges Anonymous,"This is supposed to be a comedy, but it fails to deliver when it comes to laughs. The plot involves a stooge ""addict"" who goes through a rehabilitation program to help him kick the habit of watching reruns of old Three Stooges shorts. The clinic employs Pavlovian negative reinforcement whenever the patients (many of whom physically resemble the late comics) get the urge to watch their heroes on TV. The whole film is really senseless and uninteresting and not really funny."
3,Need to really know your Batman,"The game is fun to play and has various levels of difficulty on each question card. However, you really need to know your stuff to be good at this game from the start. Even comic buffs will be stumped by a good chunk of these questions."
4,Haunting and wonderful,"The stories in this book have stayed with me for years. Russell Banks writes beautiful, improbable and totally realistic characters that suck you in and who you will carry them around with you for a long time afterward."
4,Beautiful,This cd has a lot of slower mystical songs which are very nice to listen too.There are also some beautiful photos in the booklet.
3,Good but bulky,These work nicely and hold the weight of my 20 ft boat from hitting the dock but they are super bulky to store.
2,Pretty design but the colors & lines don't match,"I was very excited to get this, it is a beautiful design. But the fence panels are distinctly different colors so it is very obvious where the lines are. I also had to get a replacement piece because one of the panels stuck to the sheet. Not as good quality as some of the other transfers I bought :("
2,Lost some intensity,This is just too damn squeaky clean. They sound like your average indie-emo figs now. The debut is better than this. Comparing this to the Stooges? Gimme a brick.
3,good album-not like the first,Minus is a fresh alternative-rock group for now on. This is a very good ulbum with some cool ideas but has nothing to do with the aggresive and distructive noice of jesus christ bobby. A more civilazid music. Fun though.Cheers
1,not jesus christ bobby,"I'm sorry but this is not Minus. Hardly close. Yes, it is more accessible and yes the sound is cleaned up but what Jesus Christ Bobby was is what actually had turned me on to the band. It was raw, it was different and I believed that it would lead towards a path of new music to come ala JCB. Halldor Laxness suffers heavily under the more mainstream sound and is less interesting than Minus's previous effort. I can just about stand the first track on this cd but that's about it. I'm sorry, whoever said ""this is what punk music should sound like"" should retake their music education. Halldor Laxness is far from punk and hope that punk will never sound like this. I'm glad that it sofar doesn't. If you really enjoyed JCB then stay away from HL. Its not worth your penny for which it's currently being offered for. This review gets 1 star for being so cheap."
5,Awesome music!!!,This cd is one of the best cd's that i have bought for long time. Minus is a great band. If you want good metal then buy this cd.
3,Quasi Descriptive Analysis,"It is a worthwhile reading if for no other reason that it is full of background and details that help with at least introducing ones self to what asylum and prison reform was like during the progressive movement. My only real argument with the book is the big leaps of claim and the jumbling of facts between asylums and prisons. Not only were these things very intertwined (one moment using an example of a prison, but then quoting facts regarding asylums). I understand that at moments there were times when these institutions were more linked, but i found that this inter-reliance decreased the efficacy of his claims as the book went on."
4,Interesting but no stand outs,"Simon here gives us some very good lyrics, but nothing stand out. All of the songs seem to follow some generic pattern, that makes the CD seem like one long tedious song."
4,Lonely rambles and odd ditties,"Simon here is moving towards a new maturity, even after an already mature and amazing career. The abstraction gets a little obscure, and the production is not always Simon's best, but it is very good, an important stepping stone."
4,one bad apple...,"I disagree with the reviewer who said all the songs sound the same. In the case of ""Cars are Cars"" I wish that were true. There are several ""peppy"" songs which breakup an album that would otherwise be a beautiful slow downward spiral, and that's ok (although I would have preferred just the spiral), but ""Cars are Cars"" is just harsh and annoying sandwiched in between the last two sweet dreamy tracks. I hate to not give this record 5 stars, (it really is one of my faves), but that one track blows it for me."
5,Were some parts exaggerated?,"I am from Berlin. I read the book. It is a great piece of writing. I believe the abuse with her father truly happened. However, having been a boarder at the convent in Gorham, during the 50's I had difficulty believing the cruelty of the nun in question. We were never abused, and we were never called by a number. They used our names. Also, I am 65 years of age and cannot recall the Columbia Hotel, nor do I know the location of the Fournier boarding house. I would love to talk to the author and get some of my questions answered."
5,Great seller,"I bought an used one at less than 1/10 price. I receive the book in two days and the book was in very good condition. No marks, like new."
3,great watch for 8 months,"Great watch for 8 months. No problems until this week when it would not hold charge for more than 6 hours. Seems the battery or charging ciruit is not functioning fully. Called FOSSIL for help: send the watch in (my cost~10$) and include a money order for 10$ return. Seeing that the watch was only worth 50$ it hardly seems worth it, except for the 4 months remaining of my ~25$ year suscription to MSN direct. Like the watch, hope it would have lasted longer... RIP ABACUS."
2,Seemed to work great for an hour,"I charged the watch for 4 hours and set up my MSN Direct service. All without a problem. The watch worked for about an hour and went dead! I tried to recharge, reboot and manually start the watch but it is just dead"
5,"Nirvana, baby!","Finally, a watch that tells more than time! If you gotta thick wrist (...), you gotta love this. It gives you uptodate news, stock quotes, weather updates (way cool, man!), and even your worthless daily schedules. Of course assuming you are still sane from information overload! This is better than your cell, man, cuz you can use it on that transUSA flight. I love this new gizmo! It runs MS software, but who cares. It's a Fossil watch!"
3,Ladies Timex,"The watch was just what I wanted, however, I think it needs a new battery which cost $5.00 plus I have to go to a jeweler to put it in. It would have been nice to know ahead of time that I would have to put in a battery, because I could have bought a new operating watch for what it will cost me to get this watch running."
5,This book is a staple for those who lead worship,An invaluable reference for Worship Leaders and pastors. Tom lays things out in a clear and concise way and leaves you with gems that you can take with you to your church. A must have.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I found this book preachy and patriarchal, and without any concrete steps for actually leading worship. Instead the author gets bogged down in endless scripture citations and examples of his own wonderfulness. A quick read, but still a waste of time. I won't be looking to this author for help in this area again!"
5,Nice and simple,"I bought Sony ICF-SW11 in somewhere in Europe for 63 US bucks. Radio has modern design, good strong knob, rotated antenna and just two AA batteries. On eleven floors of my hotel at 6pm I have received many stations from all over Europe, Asia and Middle East.I didn't expect strong signal and hot sound from this small radio and I was surprised. I have enjoyed surf around world news and spend hours. Short way doesn't overload and rotated antenna really help to get direct signal. In North America I have experience received less radio station, but reception depended where I tried to receive. In concrete building it doesn't receive any SW.AM and FM work perfect. FM keep strong signal and haven't any fuse like cheap radio.AM sensitive enough to receive station from miles away. Radio has long life battery and good definition sound. Overall it is good radio for money and has enough entertainments for travelers. I am recommending this radio."
2,Ugly,"In hand is ugly and the design is confusing. I did not like and would not recommend.But no accounting for taste, is personal. huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu."
3,Making Brothers and Sisters Best Friends,I bought this book for my daughter and had it sent to her. (Delivery was quick) She has not had time to read it. Sorry.
4,Siblings Can Be Friends,"This book is great as a read-aloud. Its style is light, warm and humorous but also weighty, when it needs to be. It is counter-cultural in that it challenges the idea that siblings ""just don't get along"" but instead, reminds that the training ground for future relationships is now, while they are young. It is full of well-chosen, real-life stories which reinforce the concept/ideal taught and is written from the viewpoint of three siblings (two sisters and a brother), which is so helpful when you have both sons and daughters who are listening. We have found the self-evaluation quizzes to be a very valuable means of application and introspection after each chapter is read.Through the company ""Tomorrow's Forefathers,"" we also purchased a companion coloring-booklet which helps younger ones focus on what is being read as they color or do the simple activities in it. It allows the main book to be enjoyed by a wider age-range."
2,US-DVD is cut,"Since there are already lots of reviews dealing with the merits of this version of 'Rebecca': Let me just say that personally I enjoyed this British TV-version, which is well done and acted. Naturally it is different from Hitchcock's version, but then I enjoy both styles. So I'd give this TV-version 4 stars in itself. However, this US-DVD has been cut (the UK-DVD is quite a bit longer), so I give this butchered version 0 points and end up with 2. If you have a codefree player, get the UK-DVD. I really wouldn't put up with cut versions if there's another choice."
1,Just Plain Awful,"This is,frankly, just plain awful. I was so disappointed when I saw this on TV because Charles Dance and Diana Rigg are such wonderful actors, and they are wasted in this watered-down version of a great classic story. Even their vast talents combined couldn't make this watchable. The version done by the BBC in 1979 or 1980 was fabulous, with Jeremy Brett as Maxim de Winter but it has never been released on video or dvd. And the girl who plays the wife in the new version is actually the daughter of Joanna David, who played the same role in the BBC show.Pass on the 1997 version--it's soap opera dramatics and hysteria."
5,great !,A film highly recommended for Diana Rigg friends and fans. I like most. Terrific and great play Dame Diana !!
3,enjoyable!,"This movie followed the book by Daphne Du Maurier pretty closely. The acting was well done and although some scenes seemed forced, it was still believable. Faye Dunnaway is wonderful as always. However, the original movie cast the part better to fit the books description of Mrs. Van Hopper. Being a minor character,this does little to take away from the story. Over all it was very entertaining and held the suspense 'til the end."
1,Terrible,"This is a terrible version of Rebecca, especially when one knows the fantastic one with Jeremy Brett as Max de Winter. This for several reasons :- Maxim de Winter looks much older than he's supposed to be, and hence the age difference with the girl is striking.- His manners are very straighforward (for example, he stares at her at their first encounter)- Some lines have been added that modify the spirit of the movie (for example when Maxim says in the beginning ""I don't know how to deal with you"" or ""This moment is not that great"").- The girl is too pretty, does not look naive enough, wears too much makeup.I could not watch more than 20 minutes of it."
3,I wish...,"if only holleywood would undertake a newer modern version of this film. I've read the novel, and I like that this movie shows us a bit about rebecca. When reading the book I pictured Hugh Jackman as a wonderful Maximilian and Julie Benz as the ghostlike Rebecca with flashbacks to this mystery woman. I know it sounds strange, but I really feel they should remake this film. Maybe get Tim Burton to do it or something? :)It was overall dissapointing. I hope they shall redo this someday. My friends agree with me on the casting though if it should ever be made."
2,Rent don't buy,"Since the Hitchcock version is out of print,I bought this version.It lacks the sinister atmosphere,suspense,and foreboding of the book and Hitchcock version.Lacking these qualities, the movie is plodding and rather boring. While Diana Rigg is intriguing as Mrs. Danvers, the portrayal of the characters of Maxim and the second Mrs. DeWinter are unsatisfying.The two have no chemistry, and I care about neither. Ultimately,I read the reviews to judge if I should purchase the movie.I will pass this version on to a friend but will not keep it in my library.Wish I would have rented it instead."
1,Hideous!,"Hideous version of fabulous classic novel by Daphne DuMarier. No one can ever top the David O. Selznick l940 version, which won Best Picture by the Academy Awards in l940. And with good reason. The movie version is ravishing, the cast fantastic, Mrs. de Hopper looked perfect, the franz Waxman musical score a classic, likewise the photography, lighting, costumes, etc. Why can't they just leave the great movie classics alone! One planned re-make that I would definitely have paid to see was in the late sixties, when Liz Taylor and Richard Burton were going to star, with Mike Nichols (who directed them in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf) with Bette Davis set to play Mrs. Danvers. Wow! That would have been something interesting. But Faye Dunaway in anything ruins it. Ignore this yuccky version. Grab the Selznick version (directed by Alfred Hitchcock) where it begins with: ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again..."""
5,Loved it!,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. I haven't seen the other two versions but I think this one would outclass those. Charles Dance is babelicious and Diana Rigg is, as always, brilliant. Emilia Fox is a little wooden but an excellent actress. Her mum, Joanna David, can be proud of her daughter following in her footsteps in the same role, of Rebecca."
4,So It's not Exact...,"Masterpiece Theatre does it again and transforms literature into moving pictures. This time they take on the task of Daphne du Maurier's ""Rebecca."" With a high caliber cast featuring such greats as Diana Rigg, Charles Dance, Faye Dunaway, and Ian McDiarmid, this adaptation takes a few liberties from the book, delivering a different perspective but still maintaining the naivete of the very young new Mrs. DeWinter(Emilia Fox). There may be some slow scenes, fortunately the cast makes them bearable."
4,"Strayed a bit from the book, but very well done","On the whole, I thought this was pretty good. The acting was terrific--Charles Dance was the perfect Maxim de Winter, and I thought Emilia Fox excellently captured the innocence of Mrs. de Winter (her name was not Caroline, by the way--that was the woman in the portrait, and Mrs. de Winter dressed up as her for the ball. Her character was never named, in the book or this version--but then you would know that if you'd read the book!) I didn't like the way the ending was changed, but this version did seem a bit more faithful to du Maurier's classic than the Olivier/Fontaine version, which I've always had some problems with. Overall--definitely worth watching!"
5,Simply Beautiful!,"Dr. Lad is so wise, and his heart is filled with love. This book is a treasure. I have been reading one poem a day before my meditation, and I just love it. We are very lucky to have Dr. Lad on this planet at this time. We can learn so much from him."
4,Very cool decal!,"If you like Mario, you should love this item. The only problem is that it's a sticker. Of course, that means you won't be able to reuse it, which sucks, but it's still cool."
4,Bill's greatest hits from the 60s (made in Mexico).,"Don't get confused with the title. This is not ""El Pionero del Rock'n'Roll"" as is printed on a little sticker you find on the jewel case. It is in fact a CD called ""Rock & Roll"". This disc features 20 songs Bill and his Comets recorded for the Mexican ""Orfeon"" label. They became quite popular in South America during the 60s and were regarded as the ""Kings Of Twist"". This collection includes Bill's biggest hit ""Florida Twist"" from 1961 (in fact an instrumental by sax-player Rudy Pompilli) and some more joyful stuff. The must obscure item is an overdubbed version of the original ""Thirteen Women"", recorded way back in 1954. The overall sound quality is very good, the package poor (no booklet, no recording dates)."
2,weak wireless book,"This is first Microsoft Press book that I can't recommend to anyone. The author is probably well versed in the technology but his ability to fully explain to the average reader is lacking. Chapter 2 should have expanded to explain the strength and weakness of each of the Authentication, Encryption, and Data Integrity processes. If you don't understand the security issues that each of these processes deals with you will be lost very quickly. Each Microsoft operating has different levels of support and setting for setting up a wireless client configuration - the book blows past this. I have found more information on the Cisco site."
5,Great Glove,This a perfect glove for men with very large hands. I purchase three different sets of gloves and after trying them all this is the only set I use.
3,Complicated and overwrought,"Having previously read Greg Iles's ""Dead Sleep"" which I thoroughly enjoyed and found to be both creepy and exciting, I approached this one with a lot of eagerness and interest.After about page 70, I was starting to get frustrated by the way the novel unfolded, but decided to stay with it. Although I was pleased to finish it, I found the story line to be overly complicated, filled with too many characters and overwrought in its execution. Things were too loose and the story although at times a bit infeasible would be of much higher quality if tightened up a bit, with more focus and less switching from scene to scene.The subject matter was very interesting and would have been handled in a more capable manner by the likes of Ken Follett, Nelson DeMille or Frederick Forsyth."
5,GREG ILES IS THE MAN,"im 15 years old and this is my second iles book. i read black cross first and was just blown away by it. it was action packed and the characters are so very real. this book is just as good or even better than black cross. i love how he mixes facts with fiction and in the end is a crazy story with tons of action yet still with facts and opinion. greg iles is , i think, the most under rated writer out there. with such spectacular works as this and black cross he should be well recognized throughout the reading world. id have to say greg iles is my favorite author out there now (along with tom clancy and jack higgins) this author would be for people who like books by such authors as jack higgins and tom clancy. even if you dont like those authors give his books a try. i gaurantee you will enjoy his work."
2,Not Typical Greg Iles Book,I'm glad I didn't read this book as my first Greg Iles' book. He's one of my favorite authors and you can definitely tell this is his debut novel. This book needed an editor. It was way too long and redundunt. Mr. Iles repeated himself several times describing characters or scenes. The middle section of the book jumped around to different characters without expanding their depth. The middle part was boring and hard to follow. I love his next books so maybe it was just a first time diaster or maybe it was the topic even though I have a strong history background. Just found this book not to have a point and when it was trying to make one then Mr. Iles did so in a monotonous manner. I wouldn't recommend this book but would recommend his others.
2,"Banality, Hessian Style","The author takes the conspiracy theory jag that the supposed Rudolf Hess imprisoned in Spandau for decades was actually an imposter who was finally silenced by British intelligence to keep him quiet in the fear that the Russians under Gorbachev would soon relent in their refusal to allow for his release and attempts to weave an imaginative tale of intrigue around it. The problem is that the plot is absurd; even if one takes seriously these possibilities, inane in their own right. Hess was a muddled man who couldn't have masterminded breakfast let alone international intrigue of momentous importance.Although the writing per se is competent throughout, even if the educated reader is willing to set aside the aforementioned grievous flaws with this novel's basic premises, the ending leaves one as flat as the Sahara. If one gravitates to this sort of work, then even Ludlum's most mediocre fare towers above this triteness."
4,Fantastic...right on up until the end.,"This is one great historical thriller. It's got almost everything you could ask for. It brilliantly mixes WWII, the Cold War, and the plight of Israel into a fascinating page-turner. Sadly, it turns into a Scooby-Doo episode at the end. I half expected the antagonist to announce ""and I would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids."" But the cartoon ending doesn't take away from the overall enjoyability of the book. It just keeps me from giving it 5 stars.If you like this book, read Double Standards: The Rudolf Hess Cover-up."
5,Best Book I've ever read,"This book has everything that you look for in a good book. Action, twists and turns, and a really good plot. Greg Iles also chose a really good subject to write about. The mysterious flight of Rudolf Hess is one of WWII greatest mysteries."
2,Not one of his best,"I am a huge Greg Iles fan and have to say I am thoroughly disappointed with this book. What it came down to for me was the fact that it just wasn't suspensful enough to keep my attention going. I lost interest in the characters rather quickly. Pick up one of his other books, they are so much better."
3,Should have left out the James Bond stuff,"I was looking for something along the lines of The Odessa File and The Boys of Brazil and picked this up. I had seen stories about Rudolph Hess not really being Rudy afterall, his peculiar death (suicide, yeah right!) and the ""Conspiracy"" among the Allies to keep hidden something that would embarrass England, America and Russia.So this book follows up on this concept and while it starts out good, it soon resorts to gimicrky with a Dr. Evil/Blowfeld style master criminal running SPECTRE-like orgranization of neo-nazis seeking to take over the world, ending with a high-tech climax right out of a James Bond movie (I could even hear the background music from the raid on Ft. Knox in Goldfinger as the Good Guys attacked the villian's secret stronghold to thwart his evil plans at the last minute). I was hoping for something more intellectual and low key a la Forsyth or even Ludlum.This book would be great if it was re-written...and reduced by half"
2,Burn this bird !,"Or maybe use it as a paperweight; gosh knows it's heavy enough.Let's see...if you can't figure out who the bad guy is by about page 50, you're either asleep or you just ain't tryin'.Hackneyed characters, implausible situations, convoluted plotting for its own sake...but hey, a couple interesting tidbits about Hess's aborted mission to England (or was ALL THAT made up, too?).The big plus for this book is that you can easily read it on an airplane flight. Any airplane flight. Like Chicago to Tokyo. Or maybe Chicago to Peoria. Just depends on how many pages you skip while reading. As I got ""into"" the story, I started skipping 3, then 5, then 8-10 pages at a time. Sometimes whole chapters. Never lost the ""plot"" (what?), never missed the ""sex scenes"" (huh?), might have missed some ridiculous blood and guts (plenty more ahead on page ""X+5"" - not to worry).Can't wait to skim his other books."
2,Less than Meets the Eye,"I listened to this as an audio book, and maybe my opinion is affected by the reader's really annoying habit of changing his voice for each of the characters, whcih included a woman with a too meek voice and dozens of Nazis screaming with German accents. However, I can't blame the reader for the book's overly complicated plot. I still don't know why the Lbiyans were attacking the house ???????? I like Greg Iles' books a lot, but not this one."
2,Into the abyss and everlasting,"Glenn Miller once wrote ""Onion Breath where are you over?"" and String of Pearls. This book had one flaws in it. Zero gravity. After spicy food it can't fart and it can keep it bottled up all the day because a girl is sitting near him in school. He wants to score because he's a soccer player with no return. Ottoman Berkley and some friends have somewhat a good idea how to feel about his coming to change. J.D. Salinger wrote that on parchment and vitally grew with no limit in sight. Why didn't this book talk about kids in the Middle Ages. I want to read a book like that. Some kids know how easy it is to be fun to talk and sing to after dinner. Speakers in the earway of oui oui is sensible to adolescents. All in all, good. Stick a fork in me 'cause I'm done."
4,Greg Iles take on WWII drama,"I'm so used to Greg Iles's novels taking place in today's time, in the U.S., and mostly in the south, that this was new to me. However, the mystery, the violence, and passion of the characters is the still the same... just in Germany. Great Book. HOWEVER!!! make sure you like WWII NAZI history and CURRENT events (Jews vs Arians/ Jews vs Muslims/ Military/Special forces, etc) or this book will not appeal to you."
1,An anemic portrayal by William Hurt!,"A terrible performance by William Hurt! I don't like him as an actor & this only proves my point!! He has a WEAK English action & just isn't the quality of actor to attempt the part of Rochester!! Miss Gainsborough is worth watching, though, she is powerful & convincing as Jane. Anna Paquin is a wonderful younger Jane; it's a pitiful movie otherwise."
2,A poor version of a classic lovestory,"This Zeffirelli version of Jane Eyre is the worst one I've seen (and I've seen them all, especially if you've read and love the book)-- I had a hard time staying to the end of the film. Hurt is totally unsuitable as Rochester, and unbelievable with his stilted dialogue (not to mention american accent); he seems uncomfortable in this role. Charlotte Gainsbourgh as Jane is more creditable, though the chemistry between the two leads falls like cold suet. This film may appeal to those who have not read the book...however, for my money, the BBC production with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke is the best one of them all."
4,Jane Eyre-I really liked this movie,"I am a big Jane Eyre fan. I have read the book countless times and seen all the adaptations that are available on DVD and I have to say that I enjoyed this one. It isn't as good as the 2006 one but it is still good. I liked the Adele in this movie better than the 2006 one and the acting by most of the characters in this movie is done very well. I showed this one to my boyfriend to get him acquainted with the story and he actually liked it even though he hates most ""chick flicks"". The music in this adaptation is beautiful."
3,I've seen better...but I've also seen worse!,"This is a fairly credible film adaptation of the novel, but if you want the meat-and-potatoes version, buy the Dalton/Clarke movie instead. If your taste runs more to weak tepid tea and stale bread, buy the Hinds/Morton version. I'd say this version falls somewhere in between."
2,A secluded Jane Eyre,"I've read the book and fell in love with it. I think that first of all the cover throws you off right away because it seems so epic and romantic. The people who did this movie abviously never read the book and understood it. The plot of the movie was so twisted and turned that it never gave the theme of Jane eyre at all. As for William Hurt, I dissaprove of his performance. His voice and his expressions are dull and drab. Though the acting itself deserves a 2. I do not recommend this movie at all. It's is a big waste of your money for you will be majorly disappointed."
4,Would have been better if it weren't for Elle!,"This is a fine version of JANE EYRE, and I loved the soundtrack and the actors...most of them. Elle MacPherson must have had a connection somewhere to have scored the role of Blanche Ingram. She doesn't cut it as a blonde, and certainly not as a high-society gal of the 1830's. This is sometimes what happens when supermodels insist on acting. Charlotte G. as Jane was totally believable. She was plain and stoic enough to carry it off.The sequence of events in the beginning was very rushed. Within the space of a two days she fights with her cousins, is spirited away to Lowood School, foments a friendship with Helen Burns, and is with Helen on her deathbed. In the book, all that unfolds within several months, not just two days."
2,OMG,"Well, i had first read the book as a requirement for summer reading. I instantly fell in love with it, as Bronte's character Jane was so much like myself. Then, as in most cases, i went out and rented the movie, expecting it to as beautiful and intricate as the book. BOY, was I ever wrong.It was so horrible, I have to admit that the begining was very well portrayed, until we came to the part where Jane had to leave Gateshead. After that, it was all down hill. What really irked me was that Rochester was blone, and didn't seem to have the complexity of the original character of the book. Also, Blanche was BLONDE! She was supposed to be dark haired, almost raven like, but was she nooooo. The ending was the worst, as it rushed along the introduction of Jane's cousines, and left out the entire point that St.John needed Jane. Uhhh. I highly un-recomend this movie, as in a great admirirer of the book I actually weept at the end of this film. Hopefully the other films have yet to prove me wrong."
5,"The Beautiful ""Jane Eyre""","I first saw ""Jane Eyre"" years ago on one of the TV movie channels and fell in love with it. I have it on tape but could only watch it on my little TV, so the DVD is just what I wanted. It's one of the great love stories."
3,A Disappointing Rendition,"The screenwriters tried to shorten the story by cutting corners, and in doing so, ruined large parts of it. Too much of the story is left untold, making it hard for people who haven't read the book to fully understand what's going on. One of the reasons the book is so wonderful, is its detail and explanation - both of which are left out of the film. William Hurt, however, made a surprisingly good Mr. Rochester."
2,"Great Book, Bad Movie","The movie was an attempt to tell the story in the book Jane Eyre, but it does not even come close to doing it justice."
3,It wasn't the best. . . but a nice way to spend a Saturday,"It wasn't the best, but a nice way to spend a Saturday Night. They've adapted the book quite well, changing a few things around, but not much. It's a very dramatic movie, and there is chemistry between Mr. Rochester and Jane. And the characters do look as how I pictured them, Mr. Rochester handsome in an odd way, and Jane . . . well, let's just call her a plain Jane. Why not check this movie out?"
3,Not The best!,I like William Hurt he is a great actor however he didnt make a good Rochester he certainly did not look the part Charlotte was A dull Jane no chemistry between the two I love all the Jane Erye movies the only ones that go by the book is the Dalton And Clark version 1983and Stephens and Wilson so far are the best the others are good love stories I still enjoy watching.
3,"Great Story, Great Actors, Less Than Great Movie","Jane Eyre is a novel I adored in high school. I never sought out the movie since I felt it would taint the way the story sits in my memory. However, the recent release of Charlotte Gainsbourg's 5:55 album sparked my interest in her past artistic works, which are mostly films. I saw The Science of Sleep, which was awesome. Jane Eyre seemed like it'd be good, but the storyline seemed rushed, which was pretty annoying. I could sense the vision was there, but for whatever reason it wasn't executed properly. Oh well, no more novel-based movies for me."
2,What a disappointment,"Well I am a fan of the book and I was really excited to see this so I went ahead and bought it. It got good reviews on rotten tomatoes and the cover just made it look good. Well, I was really disappointed. I tried so hard not to be critical, but it was BORING. They left all of the magic out of the movie. I could accept it not being very true to the book if only they had enhanced some of the scenes, but everything was just so bland. I should have rented it, and also the BBC version b/c that seems to be getting good ratings. The ending was in no way a good thing and I didn't feel any kind of true climax."
1,Hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I absolutely hated this movie! It was wierd and just plain disturbing! The leading man was horribly ugly! And so was the lady who played Jane Eyre! It was exactly like the book, to the word! But, the book was terrible, so that should explain this movie well... I would NOT watch it again, and NOT reccomend it to a friend!"
2,A poor adaptation,"As Rochester remarks, there is much more to Jane Eyre than her starched demeanor allows and in turn, more to Rochester than his repressed and sometimes cruel stance. The book is a testament to character shaping destiny and of course a love that transcends and transforms their lives.The movie fails at all levels and despite a good star cast, leaves the viewer betrayed. That might seem like a harsh adjective to use but after reading Jane Eyre and being moved by Charlotte Bronte's excellent story, the movie is a complete let down.The bright spark in this adaptation is Anna Paquin who brings young Jane to life. William Hurt and Charlotte Gainbourg have no chemistry. Her acting is wooden and Rochester looks like he would rather be anywhere else than Thornfield. I don't blame him!"
1,Not worthy of the classic!,"I have seen 4 versions of Jane Eyre and am looking forward to see the 5th. This is the worst version I have ever seen. William Hurt as Mister Rochester? PUULEEASSSE, he sucks!!! Don't waste your time on this version...there are much better versions out there!"
4,I Loved It!,"I've read the novel and seen the movie. So far this rendition is my favorite. Where I do know that they slashed the orignal story-line to pieces, it still gave me enough enjoyment to give this 4 stars. I LOOOOVE old period movies and this is just what the doctor ordered. If you want to see the movie because it came from the storyline of the book, then this is probably not for you. But if you just love ""old-time"" setting movies (like me) then you just may like this. :)"
1,Dull and lifeless from beginning to end..a dreary two hours.,"Unfortunately, my selection for a Saturday night movie at home turned out to be this version of JANE EYRE. The actors moved through their paces as if they were third rate beginners. There is no chemistry..no vitality..no power of emotion..nothing. For those of you who love the story of Jane Eyre, try the version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It is a beautiful piece of work, superbly portrayed by two gifted actors. This one should be used as a training film for young actors and directors when faced with the disaster of miscasting and poor performance."
5,a grate romance strory,"This movie is both sad and happy. I loved the romance in it, and the drama was also grate. I say this is a must see movie."
2,Wrong actress for Jane,"I have seen several versions of this novel and this one has not done justice at all to the character of Jane Eyre by casting Charlotte Gainsbourg as the lead role. She looks too young (not 18 but 15), too depressed and not at all passionate as Jane should be. William Hurt is tolerable and although he is too mellow being Mr. Rochester, it seemed that he had tried hard to create some kind of chemistry between himself and Gainsbourg. I wonder if Charlotte Gainsbourg got this role because of her father being a famous composer. At the end of the movie, I almost felt sorry for Rochester being end up with such a depressed, cold, and dispirited girl!"
2,A BIG disappointment,"As a huge fan of the book, I had high hopes for this movie version. What I got instead was a pallid Jane Eyre who sounded like she was reading cue cards and a very unbelievable Rochester. William Hurt is a good actor, but what were they thinking putting a blond American in the role of Mr. Rochester? Didn't any of the casting directors read the book? For true devotees of the novel, the only movie version that would suffice is the BBC production with Timothy Dalton. He's the only Rochester that would've made Charlotte Bronte proud."
5,What's Wrong With Lking All The Different Movie Adaptations?,"I have seen three movie versions of Jane Eyre which includes, The Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark version, the Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton version and this version with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainesburgh and I loved them all!I have room in my heart and memory to love, anjoy and apprectiate all of the different movie interpitations and I think in this version that William Hurt was wonderful and I don't give a fig that he has blond hair instead of dark hair and I enjoyed his performance and also Charlotte Gainsburgh as Jane.She may be a touch too pretty to play a Plain Jane but her performance was perfectly wonderful.I own the DVD's for this version and aslo the Dalton version and since I aslo loved the Cirian Hinds version I will also be buying that DVD!"
2,"A Disappointing ""Jane Eyre""","True to the Miramax tradition the only thing this version of Jane Eyre has in common with the book are the names of the caracters. The acting was wooden and uninspired, there was no chemistry between this Jane and Mr.Rochester and the story was changed so much, even Charlotte Brontee would not recognize it. The Ciaran Hinds/ Samantha Morton version was much better. Ciaran Hinds certainly has the ""dark brooding"" looks of the original Mr. Rochester, and when he asks Jane if she finds him handsome, she could be truthful when she said no. This version showed some of the passion and the agony that both feel. It is beond me to understand why directors spend millions to make a movie from a book, only to butcher the story beyond recognition. The classics have endured because of the ability authors like Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontee and Charles Dickens have to bring people to life. The William Hurt version has succeded to reduce the caracters to become onedimentional."
1,Terrible Representation,"I have read the book ""Jane Eyre"" multiple times, it is, in fact, my favorite book. At first, I thought that the movie had done a pretty good job of portraying the story, however, as it got further into it, they took several liberties that were absolutely ridiculous. They changed things that it was unnecessary to change, such as when and how Jane met St. John Rivers. If you love the book as I do, I would absolutely not suggest watching this movie."
2,Bored me.,"This version of Jane Eyre bored me. The acting was okay but i didn't feel any chemistry or love between Jane and Mr. Rochester. It seemed more like they were just saying the lines, but there was no emotion or feelings with them. Jane's face didn't show much emotion either, and this annoyed me after a while. The scenes at the school and beautiful scenery and costumes are good, but if you are going to watch a version of Jane Eyre currently available on dvd please watch the A & E version with Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre instead. That movie is 10 times better. I look forward to watching the Timothy Dalton version when it comes out in dvd too."
2,Very dissapointing adaptation,"This is one of the most bitter dissapointments I have ever encountered. Though the female lead did a very good job, William Hurt is the worst Mr. Rochester that I have seen so far. The movie misses so many important points that the novel makes, it is really quite disturbing. The entire relationship between Jane Eyre and the Rivers family is completely missing. The scenery shots are very pretty, and the costumes are nice, but the content of the movie is very inferior compared to the BBC version with Timothy Dalton. If you are a true fan of Bronte's novel, please buy the BBC version (1983), it is the best adaptation out there so far."
4,Another good Jane Eyre offering...,"Let's face it, Jane Eyre has been done and done and redone. Some offerings are good, some not so good, and I think this one lands in the middle of that somewhere. I loved the actress that played Jane...but did not like the actor chosen for Rochester. I didn't think he was gruff enough. Ciaran Hinds is by far my favorite Rochester. But, as a lover of Jane Eyre, I can't say I truly dislike any visual adaptation of the book...I just love the story too much. Each offering has it's positive and negative. This one has wonderful directing, lighting, filming, editing, but again, my negative was the poorly chosen Rochester. (At the time this particular version came out, my dream Rochester was Anthony Hopkins) I try to remember that there is good and bad in everything, and one strike does not a bad movie make."
4,Jane Eyre - 1996 - William Hurt,Great story and great version. My wife said this was the best love story she every saw. I thought it was pretty good. Some great acting
1,The reviewer from NYC take a hike!,"I just read the review of someone from NYC and, they said that only narrow and simple minded DO NOT like this version. I read in his or hers review that William Hurt was handsome! If you read the book you will know that He is not Handsome. This novie left out To much of the book. If you agree click Yes at the Bottom!So I do not agree with the person from NYC. Buy!P.S Check out the BBC Version of the film, it has about 100,000,000 mor percent of the book."
4,Would have been better if it weren't for Elle!,"This is a fine version of JANE EYRE, and I loved the soundtrack and the actors...most of them. Elle MacPherson must have had a connection somewhere to have scored the role of Blanche Ingram. She doesn't cut it as a blonde, and certainly not as a high-society gal of the 1830's.

Within the space of a two days Jane fights with her cousins, is spirited away to Lowood School, foments a friendship with Helen Burns, and is with Helen on her deathbed. In the book, all that unfolds within several months, not just two days."
3,See Toby Stephens version instead,"Jane Eyre has been redone so many times; all versions are interesting. But in this version, though so much is right, William Hurt is simply not the person for the part of Rochester.If you love Jane Eyre, check out Toby Stephens and his lovely Jane in the brand new production done quite recently for Masterpiece Theater (ran Jan 2007)."
2,Jane Eyre,"After watching the newest version on television, this one didn't measure up. The movie didn't make you want to watch more. There was no romance compared to the latest version."
1,Doesn't do the book justice.,"I watched this film shortly after reading the book. I absolutely loved the book, this movie cut too much from the book and changed a few key aspects. I spent most of the movie shaking my head."
5,Loved It,"This movie was really good! Jane was just how I thought she would look like! I wish there was a little more romance at the end, the end seemed a little different than my favorite book, but it helped me understand it more. I was impressed!"
1,Remarkably spiritless.....,"....adaption of Bronté's book, due to muddy direction and unengaging performances by Hurt and Gainsborough.Gainsborough wanders through the film with the dazed look of a lost (or drugged?) lamb, while Hurt is appallingly miscast, playing Rochester as a passionless, anemic milquetoast. At times both actors appeared to be suffering from an advanced case of ennui, which in turn put ME to sleep while watching.As for their lack of romantic chemistry, suffice it to say that these two couldn't start an onscreen fire if she were gasoline and he a lighted match.All of Zefferelli's beautiful photography and sets can't disguise the fact that this project is the movie equivalent of a ""lemon.""If you want to see the definitive visual version of ""Jane Eyre"", check out the BBC's excellent production starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke."
1,"Boring, don't bother","Nothing in the book implied that Jane was sickly looking. No romance, no heat, no passion. Boring. Tepid at best. Jane is supposed to be plain looking, not like she has a perpetual cold. It failed to capture Jane's intelligence. and the scene up in the attic after the wedding... what was that! This is a terrible rendition of the book. it's my better in my head!"
3,William Hurt's miscasting brings down the film,"Here you have wonderful performances in roles big & small with actors like Anna Pacquin or Amanda Root or Geraldine Chaplin or Joan Plowright. Hurt was all wrong for the role & spoiled it for me. Alan Rickman shold have played Rochester & he would have been great! You're better off renting earlier films versions, such as the 1983 one with Timothy Dalton (altho he's a bit too handsome for the role, and the movie is 4 hours long) or the 1971 hard-to-find movie with George C Scott & Susannah York. Or even the 1997 A&E production with Ciaran Hinds!"
5,What a lovely movie!!,"I'm probably the only person on earth who hasn't read the book, and believe me, it's on my list of things to do! I have now seen this particular video version two times and dearly loved it both times. I saw another version on A&E that was totally overacted and not nearly as visually appealing. Of course, I think William Hurt is just about the greatest actor ever, and I have to say that I thought he did a magnificent job. And contrary to some of the other reviews I've seen on this site - I think that he and his co-star had amazing chemistry. She was also incredible. I just loved the whole thing and hated to see it end. I watched it with my 10 year old daughter and she loved it too."
5,Jane Eyre,I have always enjoyed the different version of Jane Eyre. This was excellent movie. Even to my surprise my teenage Grandson liked it.
2,An Mediocre Cliff Notes Version of the Classic Novel,"Is there any film version of the book that stays true to the actual story? This version was very ""Hollywood."" I enjoyed the A&E film more because it was closer to the real story, but even it had flaws. Hello, Hollywood, anyone listening? We want an unadulterated, unabridged ""Jane Eyre""!"
4,GOOD VERSION BUT NOT THE BEST OF THEM,"To me, the 2006/2007 masterpiece Theatre adaption of Jane Eyre is the best I've seen. I love the chemistry between the actors in that one and Toby Stephens is the Rochester i've seen. And I also loved the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton although I think Timothy was way too Good lookig for that role, I think he did a great job. That version is as close to the book as i have seen. you don't see that very often, I was very surprised.This version with William Hurt left out alot of good and important scenes. The acting was very good. I actually liked it better than the original with Orson Wells. But It's pretty good."
2,No Passion.,"The film was very pretty, and a more accurate adaptation that I've seen previously, but, unfortunately, it lacks a key part of the book: passion. There is absolutely no tension between Jane and Rochester in this version, though from a technical standpoint they both play the parts decently. I love the book, have read it multiple times, but by the end of this film I didn't really care whether they got back together or not, so lacking in passion and tension it was."
2,The worst adaptation of Jane Eyre!,"I've watched different versions of Jane Eyre and this is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre ever. The screenwriters butchered the whole story and to make matters even worse, the actors were dull and lifeless. There was no passion at all between Rochester and Jane in this version and it seems like Rochester married Jane only because he has nothing better to do with his time. At least that's how it seems like in this adaptation. I don't think they were even interested or attracted to each other in this movie. Why bother making this movie at all I can never comprehend. But I'd recommend the stephens/wilson (Masterpiece 2006) version or even the hinds/morton (1997) version."
2,For those who have not read the book,"The first time I watched this movie, I loved it. I thought it was a great romance and had wonderful scenery and acting. Then I read the book. I now cannot sit through this movie without feeling like I am being tortured. The movie had so many inaccuracies that it might as well have a different title. This is beyond dramatic license. People who, in the book, never even met each other were having conversations, family structures entirely changed, scenes that never happened added. For what purpose, I do not know. The book is so full of wonderful dialogue and emotion, the movie cannot live up to this. I am very disappointed and will never be able to watch this version again."
2,Not worth the time,"I bought this movie expecting it to be a more modern and updated version of the Timothy Dalton version of Jane Eyre. This may be just my personal preference but if I am going to sit down to a movie I expect it to include most of the stuff in the book (the movie excluded the scene where Mr. Rochester calls for Jane and she hears and answers him even though they are hundreds of miles apart from each other, which is one of the best parts of the book)and their was absolutely no romance. I couldn't see Jane fall in love at all she just all of a sudden expresses her emotions to Mr. Rochester and he 's like ""Wow, that is totally awesome. I was hoping you would say that. Let's get married in two weeks."" Go watch the Timothy Dalton version."
1,Disappointed,"I find this version of Jane Eyre utterly pitiful. Hurt, though a good actor, didn't quite impress as Rochester. In many moments, I didn't feel the passion/tension that define the character. Gainsbourg was ok, but she lacked the passion too, especially in the scene where she speaks all her feelings when she knows she has to leave Thornfield Hall. The couple lacked chemistry, and what is more frustrating are the liberties the producers took while filming. So much of the book has been left out, and worse, changed. The Rivers didn't know who was Jane Eyre when they first met. Futhermore, leaving no adequate description of the life changing encounter with the Rivers is just sinful.It's truly disappointing, especially when you realise it's a Zeffirelli movie."
1,The worst version of Jane Eyre,I agree with all the negative comments about this version of Jane Eyre. Both lead actors are terrible in their parts. I like the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and the newer one with Toby Stephens very much. This one is a waste of time.
1,The director could have read the book first!,"I regret to say that I do not feel there were many redeeming qualities to this version of Jane Eyer. In my opinion, it turned out to be a different story entirely. The lack of feeling and desire between Jane and Mr. Rochester irritated me greatly. After reading the book, this was such an unrewarding experience for me! I have found to love the book better than any I have ever read. As I realize that it would be difficult to portray this novel in a movie well...it sure could have tried harder! Where is the spirit, the drive, the passion?! Having left out some very valuable scenes and changing the ones that were used was a complete insult, I feel, to the author of the story. She would roll over in her grave 20 times over!The young Jane was perfect for the part and had the ability to do the novel justice. Too bad it all fell flat with the story changed as it was. Did they not read the book before they made a movie on it!?! Somebody read the book!"
2,Utter Disappointment,"I had just finished the novel before watching this version of Jane Eyre and I was totally disappointed by the weak attempt to portray its depth in film. It was a thin, papery frame, really, of the events in the novel - it left out SO much and the characters were so terribly under developed. Jane, thoughout the novel, is so delicately molded into a fun, teasing, and brilliant young lady and Mr. Rochester into a passionately devoted man. In the movie, NONE of this took place - Mr. Rochester was too quiet and mean, and Jane was entirely too BORING! She had one tone and one way of acting - portraying absolutely NO DEPTH! Scenes that are supposed to develop their relationship were completely deleted, the ending was rushed, etc, etc. Overall, not good!"
3,Enriching our intellectual understanding of Nazism,""". . . of considerable interest for its insights into the continuing puzzle of why so many German intellectuals were taken by Nazism and whether postmodernist thought is indictable for the seduction. . . .Roche has enriched the dialogue about a dark chapter in intellectual history. As neo-Nazism continues its troubling re-emergence in America and abroad, we cannot learn too much about its intellectual roots and seductions."" -- from my review in the Journal of Value Inquiry, Vol. 28 (1994), 345-348."
1,what nonsense is theology!,"The entire enterprise of theology -- attempting to explain a God whom even religion notes is beyond understanding -- is by definition ridiculous and nonsense! What to say here? Simply this. The argument of Barth and Hauerwas against natural theology is simply a way of making irrational religion impervious to rational critique. If you start by saying that Christianity is not based on nature, then what is it based on? Barth/Hauerwas would say revelation. But revelation is simply the delusion of old Jews and Greeks, who had no more notion of what God was or might be than the man in the moon. Thus revelation is baloney and so is Hauerwas and even Barth, for all Barth's intellectual distinction. It is time to call a spade a spade: theology is nonsense."
3,"Cute, but non-absorbent","Like the style, but the towels do not work very well as far as soaking up wet things. They also get pretty wrinkly after washing."
3,Well written but not to my liking,"The book is well written and Ellis does a fine job of navigating each character's personality and thought process nicely. But this just was not a book I would have liked to read. Way too much drugs and sex in the book, actually that's all there really is to the book. No bottom line, no message, no point. I can watch the Kardashians for that."
1,A real stinker,"A plotless ""stream of consciousness"" series of inner conversations allegedly generated by the vapid minds of over-indulged college students in the 80's. They are a bunch of drugged, foul-mouthed boors/bores intent only on satisfying their lust. Even their sex is boring.So bad the author stopped writing in mid-word, and that was the end. I'll be using my copy to start fires with come winter."
1,Book Quality Terrible!,"It would be way too kind to describe what I received as a book. It looked like it had been photocopied and glued together. The pages were the quality of newsprint,and the best part was that the first 13 pages of the novel were missing!"
1,Tedious,"Boring characters, random couplings, and predictable situations are hallmarks of this repetitive book."
1,I got gypped,"The book I received was missing the first 12 pages. It was perfectly bound (nothing was torn out), likely a printing error. But that still leaves me in the lurch."
1,A downward spiral in society,"I believe that the human race, in general is good not angelic but good. However, this trash should not be created or read by anyone. This is why our values in society have declined. I am an 18 year old liberal colledge student."
3,It's the 80s,"This book is good, for an undergrad. You can plainly see when you read Ellis' later work the progress that he made. It does have traces of feeling, but it's a bit strained. Why would any care about these people? They're all self-centered and shallow. There are also portions of the book that are too pretensious for its' own good (the blank page comes to mind) and some of the dialogue is too cute for its' own good as well. That being said, it's still better than other young adult novels. The humor and structure are great. You could do far worse."
4,Decadent but Riveting,"The first time I read this book, I almost threw it away. Eventually I picked it back up again, finished it, and then proceeded to reread it over and over. While I find the characters morally reprehensible, Ellis has an undeniable flair for characterizing the absurd. These characters remind me of the cyphers who drifted through college drinking, smoking and screwing (but never studying or going to class). The mere fact that they graduated only proves that there exists a reality parallel to mine -- a reality that this book seems to document. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the book is how each character has a different perspective on the ""truth"". As a result, you're never quite sure what really happened."
5,scarey but it is TRUE,"I went to Bennington at the same time as BEE and from experience i can say that this book is nearly wrong to be classified as a work of fiction. I can identify nearly all the stories in the book as being real events that happened, and I think that this fact enhances the brilliance of the book. It is more documentary than fiction, and for everyone who thought it was too unbelievable, you are wrong! Anyone who went to college in the 80's can probably see their own reality in the book too!"
2,bo-ring,"I found this book really dull. I couldn't finish it. B.E.E.'s style of ""prose"" allows for a complete lack of character development. And, plot? Well, there isn't one. If you're looking for an entertaining story about petulant, exclusive New England college kids, a MUCH better read is Donna Tartt's THE SECRET HISTORY. Please disregard the author's dedication to B.E.E."
3,Not bad.,"I'm stuck between giving this book 3 and 4 stars. I'd give it 4, but it took me over 6 months to finally finish it. Though the plot is good, the characters are all very unique and well-written, and Ellis' style is refreshing, I simply wasn't hooked. Nothing about this book caused me to stay up late nights reading it; I could actually put it down for months at a time easily. I think it may be because I had a very difficult time relating to the characters, they're all dreadful and miserable in their lives and sometimes I'd find myself absorbing some of their negative attitudes.But having said that, this is a very entertaining, realistic book. It's funny, depressing, ironic and thought-invoking, all at the same time. It shows you how much the perception of a situation varies from person to person, and it makes you draw your own conclusion of what's reality and what's fantasy."
3,Odd but to be expected,"I read this book based on it being the same author as ""American Psycho"".It was set in the 70's and revolved around college kids who were all linked together (but you discover that as the book unfolds).Lots of drugs, sex (not so much rock'n'roll though).Okay read"
4,dress to get,"more of the Ellis genre where everyone is rich but broke, everyone is bisexual and everyone is miserable and lost finding themselves relating, often intimately (sex), in kakfa-esque ways- i was suprised here to see that ellis returns back to the same characters tying all his novels to the same central world - clay from Less than Zero is back at camden college and simply referred to as the kid from California, playing a minor role. sean, patrick bateman's little brother, is here, playing more of a major role, as well as characters like lauren hyde, jamie fields and victor johnson who all turn up later in Glamorama."
3,Humorous but ultimately frustrating look at youth in turmoil,"I read this book many years ago when I still romanticized ""college life."" I had enjoyed Ellis's previous book, Less Than Zero, for its morbid wit and portrayal of affluent, apathetic youths in California. I found Rules to be funnier than Zero, but found all of the characters too apathetic and devoid of humanity.There are a few memorable bits--the description of some gay charcters is classic (""...witches from Macbeth, but infinitely better looking and dressed in Armani, there is a character who becomes mordantly depressed over the break up of WHAM (##!!).It's a good read for those under 30 who still find college/sexual angst compelling. For others, it's probably tedious and self indulgent."
2,A true glimpse at college life.,Ellis usually writes about horrific things from out of nowhere to facilitate his reputation as a splattercore writer charading as one of the contemporary greats. But here Ellis captures a darkness that is indeed real and for this he must be given merit. His characters all have the same voice just as in any of his other novels. There is nothing to be learned from this novel although some may take it as a warning. Orwell warned of a Totalitarian future in 1984 and Ellis warns upper Middle class parents about sending their kids away to college.
5,"What University can be like if you let it, GRITTY realism","Probably the best of BEE's books (though Less than Zero and American Psycho are also excellent and Informers and Glamourama are best left to the Die hard fans. A most effective first person narrative kind of takes us into them minds of a group of College students. Hilarious at timesthough less so than AS, Depressing sometimes though less so than Less Than Zero. It far more based in reality using ""normal"" characters, even today campuses aRE really like this and one sees something of oneself and acquaintances. As someone said earlier a great book to read before College (oras we say in the Queens English University). I did and think it helped me get laid a lot more and get more out of Uni!"
1,Never thought I could despise fictional characters so much,"I never hated fictional characters as much as the ones that populate this novel. Every single character is vapid and superficial to a nauseating degree. That wouldn't be so bad in itself, if I found it entertaining, but I really didn't and I don't know how I managed to finish it.On the other hand, Ellis is an excellent writer, I can't deny that."
2,Not as good as his others.,"I recommend Ellis's ""Less Than Zero"" over this one, hands-down. In my mind, they covered very similar subjects (college kids who drink and drug and sex too much), but LTZ was more convincingly-written.I did like ""The Rules of Attraction""'s narrator-swapping (see: TRAINSPOTTING) and the fact that because you saw the same events from several points-of-view, you never exactly knew what was really going on.... but even that lost my interest after a while.In short: If you're interested in Ellis's books, you're probably going to read this anyway; if you're looking for a place to start, pick up ""Less Than Zero"" before you get this one."
4,"Sex, Drugs, Rock n School","If I were to sum up this book in one word, it would be clairvoyant. I loved the feeling of dissonance by the brut male main character of his whole surrounding even though it was obvious that at times he was truly and deeply bruised mentally by other characters in this book. Sean, the main character, had the coolest, calmest attitude throughout the whole book, however, he was the guy who was hurt the most by girls when he was rejected. I loved the symbolic nature of the dialogue that showed the thick skin of these characters and the consequences of nonchalant gestures and how these kids come to learn that they must ""deal with each other"" to be successful and not get hurt. To allow yourself to be vulnerable is to set yourself up for pain and self implosion.The message is very bleek but it rings true in high society and shows a glimpse inside the head of Ellis' tropical fantasy/reality symbolic world, whatever that may mean."
2,What a let down,After reading American Psycho and Lunar Park I was keen to read this particular novel. I found it repetitive and meaningless - a series of anecdotes and empty characters. I guess that was what it meant to portray - the bankrupt youth living on alcohol and drugs. But what does it all mean ? Nothing.
4,A Look at Lost Values,"I have read some reviews regarding how empty this novel seems. I must disagree. Ellis shows true style in his use of perspective as he tells, and retells, the novel's events through the different characters. He shows how the 80s generation prolonged the high school extremes, love or death, into their college years -- as the people simply exist to take drugs, fail classes, find new bodies to lay down with, and attempt suicide to get attention. I found the novel to be highly amusing, and his technique of ending the novel in mid-sentence suggests that the condition may only continue."
4,Classic James Ingram,"hard to believe this album is almost 25 years old. I would play this album all the time back in the day along with MJ's Thriller and Lionel Richie's ""Can't slow down"" those were my main three albums back in the day. James Ingram has that voice and always had a Groove. ""try your Love again"", One More Rhythm"" were my jams along with ""party animal and Ya Mo Be there. I played this album all the time back in the day.he has always been One of My All time Favorite Artists. dug his work for others and his instrumental playing. Brother James Ingram has a wicked falsetto and he will knock it out the box."
4,this Album still Kicks Booty!,"James Ingram was One of My Favorite Artists back in the day.I use to wear this Tape out.matter of fact I still got the Tape&Cd.Jimmy Smith is Grooving on ""One More Rhythm"" that was my first introduction to Jimmy smith as a Kid thanks to brother James Ingram. when Jimmy smith laid down that Organ solo on Michael Jackson's Song""bad"" then i knew I had to go to school on brother Jimmy smith.back to this Album""Ya Mo Be There"" with Michael Mcdonald was a Cut.Quincy Jones's Production&Arranging Vib are all over here.The Q Camp is all over here.Rod Temperton,Glenn Ballard,Patti Austin,Greg Phillinganes,etc... but James Ingram's soulful Pipes is what makes this album still so Tight.James Ingram is One of the most slept on Vocalists Ever IMO.I was Grooving to this Album recently.still Slamming."
5,Fantastic cd and brilliant vocals @}->---,"James Ingram has always been a favourite of mine. To me, he's up there with Luther Vandross, Peabo Bryson and Babyface as a favourite male vocalist. His voice is smooth and silky and the music has always been great.The top songs on here are Yah Mo B There, Party Animal, Whatever We Imagine and It's Your Night. It's hard to pick out one or two favourites because actually these songs are all fantastic. While this music is now considered Old School, it's still the kind of music I listen to often and it's almost timeless to me.Do yourself a favour and try to find this cd. You'll fall in love with his music and his vocals for sure. He's still got it, but this is when he was really on fire and I still enjoy listening to this great cd even now. I love it."
5,great target!!!!!!!!!!,"Mounted this target on 2X10 X 10 in. long treated lumber,you dont need stakes.Also made a threaded mount for rings held on by a wingnut.Oiled all joints and moving pieces with a drop of oil.Have fired 400 pellets at this target with no problems.Easy to disassemble and repaint.HOURS and HOURS of FUN."
5,great target,"if this target cost $40.00 it would still be a good buy . i dont see how you can build these an -sale an / ship an not lose money, i think this is the best air gun target of this tip you can buy i bought 2 they were so good i bought 3 more so i can set one at 20 yards them / 25 / 30 /35 /40 yards this is a good setup ."
4,5 stars without the reducers,"These targets work as intended. Several aftermarket manufacturers make thicker faceplates for them but the originals are tough enough to handle years of use with air rifles under 20 ft-lbs of energy. The string is a good quality without too much stretch. The reducers will routinely fall off when hit so they're useless for Field Target competitions and irritating for target practice.When assembling the targets you have to be careful when tightening the large nut against the faceplate. If you use a lot of torque without bracing the kill zone paddle linkage, it is easy to twist the parts so that the friction fit washer will come off a connecting pin.There are lots of Field Target clubs that have been using these in competition for years. At this price there's no target that can compete with the Gamos."
4,Big fan,"This target makes shooting fun again. I got together with a couple of my brothers and starting taking shots at this poor squirrel. Trash talking and wagers ensued.The only problem I have had is that the ""Kill-Zone Reducers"" sometimes fall off when the squirrel falls. They just sit in too loosely. This problem is minor, though, seeing as if you want a tougher shot, you can just move the target further away. The string is plenty long enough to challenge any skill bracket."
4,Nice Target,I just got this and also orderd the extra target plates with it.it is nice and sturdy the only thing i did not like is i had tochange the clips the hold the yellow target to the black animal shapeit would come off. I just put a bobbie pin in it place and it works great.
3,Not for BB Guns,"My fault, I should have read the description closer before ordering this item. My son was excited to get this but I'm afraid that the BB's will bounce back. It is for soft pellet guns only. We are keeping it with the idea that we may get the soft pellet guns for shooting practice later."
4,Good solid target,Bought this target for my 8 year old daughter to use with her daisy BB gun. Instructions say to use pellts on target but the red ryder is knocking down the target from a good distance of 25 feet. I anchored the target to a 2 x 10 for stability like others have suggested and it works just fine. Gave it only a 4 star due to the paint chipping very easy for BB's and I will have to paint rather quickly if my daughter keeps knocking em dowm.
4,Just Plain Fun,Easy to setup and works quite well. Made of fairly thick steel. Looks like it will be durable. Using the included reducers and varing distances from the shooter provides many challenging options. Use cheap black and yellow spray paint to refresh the finish as it gets shot off.This is an airgun target; do not use with powder burners. I would not suggest using very high powered air rifles on this target either. The reducers can fly off the target as they only hang from a small hook. I use clear packing tape to hold the reducer in place. That was the simplest and cheapest option. Another tip is to use a heavy duty snap swivel to attache the string to the target. The included string tends to be 'twisty' when winding it back up and the swivel spins out the twist.
1,Disappointing - almost negates Book #1,"I loved the first three books, but this one totally disappointed me. In taking away Stephie, Swann took away Nohar's soul. And why bring Maria back now? The plot was good, but I kept wishing Stephie was there with him. if you read the first three, skip this one. Even with the great plot, it'll leave a bad taste in your mouth."
2,Disappointing,"I find this paper inferior to other parchment papers. I have used another brand (can't recall the name) that was much whiter in color. It was bombproof and never, ever leaked. This parchment paper leaks through very easily requiring a complete cleaning of the pans used. My previous experience with parchment allowed for very saucy dishes, cooked for an extended period of time with literally NO cleanup required of the pan. Not a very good paper in my opinion."
4,"paramour, great musical group","I bought this C.D for my daughter for Christmas, she has been playing in on our car's c.d. player. I was impressed with the vocals from this group and each song has great rythm. My daughter really enjoys this one. It is one of her favorites."
4,Its good,"Its your typical teenage angst ridden music.The songs are catchy. some have a good beat to it, but again, it sound like the hundred of other teenage pop punk rock bands. its nothing new.The lead singer delivers out great vocals, i've heard them live and they are indeed great.Its a good CD to listen to when driving home from a stressfull and tiring day."
5,Paramore makes another amazing album.,"I recently purchased this cd in an effort to find something more from Paramore. Since ""All We Know Is Falling"" was an exceptional album, I knew for a fact this one would be too. And sure enough, as I played the very first song I was completely blown away. Not only was their first album great, but I can say this one is even better. All the songs are more hard and rocky, and Hayley's voice is beautiful as always. The sound is more clean and it's simple to fall in love with each song. I will add that my favorite song on this album is the last one, ""Born For This"". I would suggest you buy this album immediately if you loved ""All We Know Is Falling""!"
3,"Good, but nothing new.","I'm actually a really big Paramore fan. And i absolutely loved All We Know Is Falling.. Riot on the otherhand i feel is not a big change up its just a little more slowpaced.Its not that i dont like the cd, but everytime i hear a song from the Riot cd (Misery Business, Born For This and Fences) it reminds me of a better song on the AWKIF cd.. this irritates me a little bit and im a little disappointed that their style have changed so little.Of course i think that a band should stick to whats working for them at most points and the guitar play is also very paramore recognisable.but unfortunately i feel that this cd is just a slower and poorer version of All We Know Is Falling."
3,It really doesn't sound like they broke free.,"This cd is not a bad one but it sounds like they haven't broke free from their first album. The sound is a little bit more varied this time around which is good but the lyrics aren't so much. The songs sound like just another version of their other songs off ""All We Know Is Falling"". For example, If you listen to ""Born For This"" you can obviously spot the strong resemblance to ""Pressure"". After I listened to ""Misery Business"", I thought this album would be a lot different for the better. I was expecting way different sound from ""All We Know Is Falling"" and lyrics but it just didn't deliver."
4,Refreshing,The cd is very good althogh is a bit raw because the band is still starting...overall is good!
2,Generic Rock Pop,"I had the displeaure of seeing this ""band"" opening for No Doubt. When I heard them then I thought every song sounded the same, buried beneath the unfortunate mixing job their live sound engineer was barely accomplishing. I thought they may have some potential and I was right as evidenced by exactly two tracks on this album, crushcrushcrush and some other song I can't be bothered to learn the name of. Overall the studio album is depressingly similar to their live show, track after track of soul numbing sameness."
2,For the Pop Kids and Wannabe Rockers,"Paramore is all about Hayley Williams, and that shows pretty bad on Riot!, the band's second album. The music is as plain and generic as it gets, sounding like just about every other pop rock/emo band out there right now. Hayley is a decent singer, and the melodies, although nothing groundbreaking, are actually quite decent. Unfortunately fairly good melodies never have, and never will make up for poor lyrics. Williams tries to be witty but ends up sounding whiny and overly cynical (think Anberlin without the clever word plays).At the end of the day this is good music for teens who THINK that they're rockers (fans of the Academy Is, Cute Is What We Aim For, etc) but are actually good pop kids. Skip this if you listen to real music."
3,Hit and miss,"Some of the songs I really liked, but the rest were just ""blah"". I guess that's what I've come to expect when buying entire albums as opposed to cherry-picking the tracks."
5,Amazing,"It really showcases Hayley's voice. From her Punk/Alternative voice in songs like ""Fences"" (my favorite ^^) to her raw singing ability in the slower songs like ""When it Rains"" and ""We Are Broken"", this album is incredible all the way around. I would recommend it to any Alternative fan."
4,Fun for All Ages!,"Ok I'm old enough to be a mom to these kids, but I've been playing this cd NONSTOP in my car since getting it weeks ago. The band is tight and I like everything about the music. The drummer is excellent, and the whole band has great energy. The songs are catchy.Dare I say they remind me of No Doubt (minus the ska, prominent bass and quirky singing)?Keep it up Paramore!! I will definitely check out your other recordings."
4,Good but not as good as their first album,"First off let me just say that I've liked Paramore before they became mainstream and before MTV(the channel that never plays music)damaged them..some what.Paramore's first album is much better than Riot, but this isn't a bad album at all. Songs like: That's What You Get, When It Rains, Miracle, We Are Broken, and Born For This keep this album from being a bore.Paramore still has a great sound, they just need to go back to their roots and tone down on the Pop."
2,Nothing Special,"She has a distinct voice but it's not very original music. The radio singles are good, but not good enough to carry the CD."
2,One For the Pop Kids,"Paramore is all about Hayley Williams, and that shows pretty bad on Riot!, the band's second album. The music is as plain and generic as it gets, sounding like just about every other pop rock/emo band out there right now. Hayley is a decent singer, and the melodies, although nothing groundbreaking, are actually quite decent. Unfortunately fairly good melodies never have, and never will make up for poor lyrics. Williams tries to be witty but ends up sounding whiny and overly cynical (think Anberlin without the clever word plays).At the end of the day this is good music for teens who THINK that they're rockers (fans of the Academy Is, Cute Is What We Aim For, etc) but are actually good pop kids. Skip this if you listen to real music."
5,THE BEST PARAMORE CD!,"Yep this is it! The cd that made Paramore famous! If that doesnt convince you to buy it, listen to some of the songs! THERE JUST SO DANG CATCHY! The music is sick! the vocals are perfect! and the drums and guitars are great! JUST GET IT ALREADY!"
3,This is A Record Not a CD,Umm for anyone who is wondering what Vinyl is that means a Record my son wanted this and I thought the name of the album was Riot Vinyl so when we got it I was Shocked and wondering why they still made Records I don't even own a record player but it will be a collectors item so I will keep it
5,awesome!,"I can't believe I have not heard of this group before now. I love the sound, lyrics, everything really! I can't stop listening!"
5,amazingly awesome!,"i became a paramore fan summer of '08 when i saw the video for ""crushcrushcrush"" before that i never even heard of them besides that demi lovato liked them and i thought they would be a teeny disney type band.... well they're not! omg i loved it and i went into it wanting to hate on it because of demi liking them, but i love them and then we got rockband and that song was on it! they are now my second fav. band and this cd is my favorite i love all the songs on it and could listen to it over and over the songs are great! the band members are great! and a little while after they were on the twilight soundtrack which was GREAT! this album is just so amazingly awesome!"
4,A few good eggs,"theres without a doubt a notice in growth between their last cd and riot, but like most people have mentioned, a few good singles cannot carry the cd. also lyrics are somewhat forced and often times cliche. but still a good listen"
5,"More Paramore, Please","I bought Riot! about three weeks ago and have listened to it almost every day, if not every day! My introduction to Paramore was by my eleven year old daughter on MTV.com. CrushCrushCrush immediately caught my attention and I've been hooked on their songs since then. The maturity and power of 19 year old Hayley's voice is staggering and the guys in the band play as performers much older and more seasoned than 17,20 and 22.Emergency is the second song that snagged me and the video is done really well. These four musical artists also look like their having alot of fun when performing live or just doing a video for TV. I don't own 'All We Know Is Falling', but I plan to buy it soon mainly because of 'Emergency'.Given the opportunity and with the right management Paramore should be around for many years to come. Keep it up, guys(and gal)!"
5,Amazing C.D.,"My dad bought this C.D. for me and I absolutely love it! It's got great music, there isn't one song that I do not like on this C.D.!"
3,Ehhh.,"I'm a sucker for a band with female vocals, so it seemed like it would be a good buy. I really enjoyed a few of the songs on this album...for a month. Somehow, I found myself skipping their songs on my MP3 player rather frequently. Simply put, I just got sick of the album (and that rarely happens with me). I'd say, it's ehhh... ok."
5,Excellent,"This is one of the best albums I've bought, but I really have no idea how to review music, it being so subjective. I suppose the only thing I have to say is, Paramore is so unique in its sound that they're definitely worth a listen, and if you've liked any song of theirs you've heard, you'll most likely enjoy this entire album."
5,AMAZING,"Never was a fan of Parmamore growing up, never gave them a chance and thought they were just another TRL band. I have grown to love them after finally listening to this album from start to finish. I now put them in the same group as Blink 182(one of my favorite bands all time). Every song they put out is extremely catchy and an anthem of are youth. This album gets me so pumped up, I love it."
1,"These shoes are very hard on your body, do not recommend","I have the exact same feelings as William Hunicke in his review. I also do not have knee problems, but after running with these even for short distances now, my knees hurt. I have had them for probably a year now and I just can't take it anymore. I'm on here to buy a new pair of shoes.I actually think they may have had a bad long term effect on my knees. Seriously, look elsewhere. They might look cool, but that is the only thing they have going for them."
1,Injury in wait,"4 miles onto the first run in these shoes I developed a fore-leg tendon injury that took 4 months to heal. I have been using other running shoe brands for years with no problems.I realize it may just be my specific build/running mechanics, but hey,I will not touch these shoes with a 10-foot pole ever again-Tom"
2,"adidas Men's a3 Gigaride Running Shoe,Cyber Metallic/Blue,14 M",These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes. The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact. I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them. I returned them and plan to try something else.
3,Worked OK for a while,"Bought this a couple of years back and it worked great for it's intended purpose.....kind of. Had to use a pro vacuum/blower to complete the job on a 20' run consisting of 2 turns within 4' and then a straight run. On the same house, some time later I used the same gear...only with a pro blower leading into said product and a pro vacuum sucking in at the outlet. 3 years later, the product cracked at the spout. Useless at that point.Call a pro or have the extra gear necessary to get the job done for a short run and be prepared to possibly purchase often. This is not a buy it once item."
1,Never Worked Once!,Bought this for a long car trip. Didn't work even one time across three states and four days! A waste of money.
2,disappointing,Product works - but when you are driving you get lots of interference when you drive by powerlines - a clicking sound. The signal also goes away periodically so you have to switch to a different channel.
5,Easy to use FM transmitter,The FM transmitter was as described on the site. It came in as is condition. Works well with all types of mp3 players. Quality of transmission is good (depends your FM receiver as well). Range of transmission is ~ 40 fts. All in all good product with decent price.
2,transmition clarity isnt that great,"UPDATE: its not the problem with this product, i guess all the RF Tx have the same issue.I brought this looking at the other reviews, but i did wantedly not follow the only 1 -ve review. I was expecting a good sound clarity, which is not. there is a lot of noise, even at the lower frequencies. Yeah...but i guess that is what one will get at this price. :("
1,Worked only 1 week,I don't recomend this transmitter. It worked only one week before breaking. The sound quality was so-so.
2,Coby fm transmitter,"Great price...but that's the only reason i gave it 2 stars. i have to almost tape the thing to my car radio to be close enough for a good transmission. Other reviews seemed to have better results with this, i did not."
1,Very limited range for clear reception,"Based on the other reviews I bought this product. I wanted to play my Sansa MP3 player through my home stereo while sitting in my chair about 15' away, but the reception is unclear unless I am standing right next to the receiver. I also wanted to use it in my car, but with the Sansa and the Coby transmitter sitting on the console, the car radio, which has a fender mounted antenna, gets a lot of static. I'm using fresh batteries. Disappointing."
2,Ok - must depend on your car's antenna,"Tried the unit in two different cars.One was completely static - couldn't use it at all (Acura MDX), the other car was OK, but enough static to bother me enough to return it (Lexus ES300).All in all I think you're taking your risks on this unit. It may work great, or it may not - depending on your car."
1,Argh.,This band started sucking in 1995 and only gets worse--illustrated clearly by this album. They were great before attempting to morph into Screeching Weasel.
2,On-line just as helpful,"Save your money if you simply need to learn how to do a particular geometric construction by Googling ""geometric construction"" and you'll find many informative sites, some with animated constructions. This book is impressive, well written and will be a good read over the summer when I have more time. I was in a pinch tutoring Honors Geometry and needed to quickly learn how to construct a regular pentagon. This books gives the proof and is pretty clear (once I'm not in a panic), but I googled and found a one-paragraph explanation which solved my immediate construction need."
5,80s classic movie,Racing With the Moon80s classic movie2 boys with weeks to go before they go to war.Nicholas Cage and Sean Penn are the 2 boys.even with them smoking and drinking this is still a great movie to show your kids about early america and the boys that went to war.
4,About friendship and a hazy future,"Uneven but generally engaging movie set in northern California in 1942 that is concerned with two 17-year-old boys about to join the marines and their last month at home together. Both boys (Sean Penn and Nicholas Cage) have an amorous entanglement with different girls - Penn's leading to love (with Elizabeth McGovern), Cage's to an unwanted pregnancy and abortion (with Carol Kane). There isn't very much to the story, which leads to some unfortunate filler, such as a sequence in a pool hall where the boys try to hustle some sailors. But the movie gets across very well, and without bashing us over the head about it either, that these two guys are very good friends and, since WW II is going on, just may never see each other again. The romance between Penn and McGovern is poignant in its innocence, and there's just a nice feel-good quality about the whole thing. The settings are great, too, with careful attention to details shown. Worth a watch."
4,Penn and Cage in the early days...a MUST see!,"Sean Penn and Nicholas Cage, together with Elizabeth McGovern star in this 1940's WWII film about being a young man getting ready to head off for the war and trying to find himself and deal with his fear before he goes. It's wonderfully written, with some heavy scenes that were unexpected and some very moving dialog. Love and love lost...the three of them are at their finest here!"
4,Fascinating to see Sean Penn and Nicholas Cage as young studs,"This movie is set in 1942 and has a sweet innocence as it portrays the close friendship between two young men who are about to go off to war, and the budding romance of one of them with a beautiful young woman who is not as rich as she seems. It's amazing to see these two actors so early in their careers playing earnest roles that alternate between braggadocio and swagger on the one hand and touching vulnerability and occasional stupidity on the other."
5,SHOULD BE ON CD!!!,"This tape I have had for ten years or more, and it is worn out. I would like to have these songs on compact disc, but they are not all available on compact disc, help!!!"
1,Loathsome at best,"I'm a straight A college student -and this is the worst textbook set that I have encountered thus far. Some of the exercises can be described as nothing less than painful. The exercises are vague, impossible and outright annoying at times. This is not to say that some concepts are not well addressed -but it is to say that this textbook is woefully inadequate for any level of course instruction. I've bought and read perhaps 700 books through Amazon -and never before have I been so compelled to write such words of warning. The french language itself is not a difficult topic - this text betrays that truth. Your students will hate you if you use this book."
4,Je Veux Bien,"I received the packet in a timely matter. The only issue is that the 3 cd's that were supposed to come with the book did not arrive with it, so that has set me back alittle in my french class. Beyond that, I am pleased."
5,Unfortunately not available in German...,Great fable story.Instructive and funny.Wonderful watercolours.A must for children above/under 18!Groszartige Fabel.Lehrreich und witzig.Wunderschoene Aquarellzeichnungen.Ein Muss fuer Kinder ueber/unter 18!
3,"Nice read, but somewhat lacking","This was a nice read, but somewhat lacking in depth that creates strong emotion to the reader. I read this first and I will not read the prequel, Hero of Flint Hills, as I will donate this book to our library in hopes others will enjoy it more than I did."
4,Amazing Stories,"Amazing, moving stories that gave me goosebumps! The beauty of love and kindness to fellow human beings in the midst of all the monstrosity of WWII was wonderful to read."
4,A Manual of Fingerweaving,A good book with instructions for a number of fingerwoven patterns and includes the introduction of beads into the weaving. Great color photos of patterns and finished woven sashes. A good reference and instruction book to have. I am glad I purchased this book for myself.
1,really lousy -,very poor - could not get units to communicate even next to each other - much less from 100 feet--don't go there--
1,Very Disappointing!,"The following comments refer to the second edition (1947) but appear to apply also to the first edition (1930).This biography of Laennec is very disappointing. The author has adopted an irritating style that attempts to personalize Laennec. Thus the book is full of dialogues and ""streams of thought"" that cannot be and are not supported by references. In fact the references are very limited in number and cited only in the preface.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!Rodger Shepherd"
3,"Nice movie, but troubling ending","Spoiler alert.This was one of those movies that lacked dialog at many points, but it didn't hurt the movie one bit. Nobody ever said good acting involved constant talking.The ending was a bit abrupt and unclear though. I have no problem with the turn the movie took, it just was not very clear and there are aspects which just aren't believable. So Roy gets caught in the act and then is so upset he allows the boy he has finally confessed his love for to be raped and murdered by his latently gay homophobic friend. Was there something else supernatural going on?Sad and quite weird."
4,Dreamy Until The Bittersweet Conclusion,"Dream Boy is a gay teen romance that somewhat reminded me of films like Latter Days, Edge of Seventeen, and Get Real. It's beautiful, romantic, and at times sad and hard to watch. It's also well-acted and has a cast of four pretty boys that are a sight to behold. The conclusion of Dream Boy brought a tear to my eyes, which is a good thing and a bad thing. It's a bad thing, because I wasn't in the mood to watch a sad movie. And it's a good thing because it shows that there are still movies being made that are touching and emotional. Movies like Dream Boy."
3,sweet,this is a sweet and gentle coming of age story. the characters are young teenagers who just happen to be gay. would recommend for younger viewers
3,Boring pace and lack of acting,"This movie lacked substance. The movie started slow and ended leaving you wondering where the heck is the ending. The movie had the opportunity to really explore each boy's life more, but spend too much time on a boring bus with no one talking."
3,I waited Soooo Long,"Okay, I am a huge fan of the book, HUGE! I must have read it at leats ten times since I discovered it five years ago. Its a beautiful story, seriously I feel every emotion reading this, and when I heard they were making a movie out of it, i was so damn excited, and while the movie is good, it barely is! Stephen Bender, is a terrible choice as Nathan, im serious, he was just so boring in the role, and Max Roeg, while beautiful he just wasnt Roy, now the only well cast person was randy Wayne, but I feel he could have been a better Nathan, after I saw How To Save A Life, that proved it. The saving grace of this movie was that it folloewed the book rather well, and it is beautiful, but it could be so much more! I reccomend the book and the movie only if ur a hard core fan!"
5,LONG awaited,"I've been waiting for a movie adaptation of this book since I read the book in ?2005? and when I heard they were going to be making one, I was jumping for joy. Little did I know that it was going to take quite some time before it was actually released. I caught it at a film festival and loved it but, I've been waiting rather impatiently for an official DVD release in America for this movie.Now it's here and I recommend it to anyone who loves a simple yet compelling love story."
3,An enjoyable story about gay teens.,It is slow at times but worth the wait. Max Roeg is especially good and he is BRITISH! He has a very convincing southern accent in this movie. The sex scenes were well done but the ending did not fit the rest of the movie and made no sense.
3,"Interesting read, but overpriced with wrong predictions","Received the book yesterday and read it in an hour. The theory presented - that societies learn by abruptly changing strategy (lurching) without maintaining the good elements of the old strategy and thus making unnecessary mistakes (which later on have to be corrected) - is interesting and convincing.I just wonder whether knowing about this theory would really improve politicians' and ordinary people's decision-making.Unfortunately, the author's predictions about the development of the US welfare system from 2000 on were completely wrong - instead of more attention for important domestic issues, the present US government has chosen to start a war against terrorism, with the result of jeopardizing the welfare not only of US-citizens but of Europeans as well."
5,Build your foundation strong,I retain what I read when I can write notes and reword what the topic says into my own words. Thankfully there are many versions of the bible to help me with the interpretation of the words. The Grasping God’s Word book and workbook help me understand the structure the words were formed in.
5,"Review of ""Grasping for God's Word""",Book received in excellent condition and in a reasonable amount of time. Would buy from this seller again.
3,Noisey fan,"This Westinghouse fan was the right size for my small laundry room, but it is noisey compared to my silent Hunter fans."
2,ONE TEENSY CANDELABRA STYLE LIGHT BULB,I bought a similar fan at a garage sale and needed another. The fan I had already has a regular light fixture in it. This one has only ONE bulb and it is the little candelabra base style and has a max 40 watts on it. This is not enough light for a bedroom. My son has to have a lamp in his room now because of the lack of light this ceiling fan provides.
1,I hate it!,"It is so small like a toy! has so much noise and not stably, the light isn't common and hard to replace"
5,Excellent small fan,"We are using these fans in bathrooms and over the kitchen sink in a condo with relatively small spaces. It does an excellent job, is quiet, and looks well built. I wish WESTINGHOUSE made replacement blades for this model because blades do wear out before the fan 'dies'...Would love to know if anyone does make these...I've looked and looked."
2,broken glass globe,"It arrived very timely...well packaged, but the glass globe was broken.. anyway, I installed it.. its very easy, even with the 60 year old wiring in my house.. first thing is to throw away the instruction sheet...Would only suggest removing the small screws/bolts that hold the blades on before you mount the fan motor to the bracket..Its difficult when its mounetd and moving around.. Seems that the cheaper the fan, the easier the install.."
2,All fans are not created equal....,"We set about installing these ceiling fans with much enthusiasm. Bought four instead of the eight that I really need, just to make sure we weren't adding boxes to our stacks for an extended time.All set up and ready to go...lights work, but not the fans. Now we are pulling all four out of the boxes and doing our diagnostics to see if we've missed something.Do not want to have to return them, but do need them to work!"
1,not a fan of Westinghouse fans now,"Initially I was very happy to see Westinghouse made a small 30"" Hugger ceiling fan so I ordered it from Amazon.com, when it arrived I realised it had been exported from the U.S.A. where the mains voltage is 110 volts so I contacted Westinghouse Customer Care via e-mail to ask if this fan is suitable for U.K. 240 volts, this I did FIVE times, people, Westinghouse does not have any customer care as they have totally ignored all of my e-mails even the one that stated I was very suprised and disappointed with their customer care, needless to say I will NOT be buying anything Westinghouse again but still have not resolved wether or not it will work in the U.K. so Amazon.com and Westinghouse you do NOT have a satisfied customer."
3,Great Size - Noisy,"If you are purchasing this just based on the size and appearance, the fan is great. I think the thing is noisy and has a constant low level hum. I have 4 other Hunter fans in my home and all are extremely quiet - Unfortunately, this was the only one I could find in this small size so I was limited to Westinghouse. It went into my daughter's room and she says that I am the only one to notice the hum so I guess it's OK for 50 bucks."
1,Lasted less than 6 months,"This fan died last night, less than 6 months after installation. And, as it is in a stairwell, we only use it during the wood stove season, so the fan itself has only been used a couple of months. It replaced one that had been in use for 15 years. It is noisy as well. We have to have the small size to fit in the stairwell, so there aren't a lot of options for small fans."
2,Extremely loud fan,I bought this fan for a hallway/stairway because of it's small width and depth. It's motor is entirely too loud. I can't stand having it on. It even drowns out the quieter motors in the ceiling fans in our bedrooms.
4,Long-time owner of this fan,"I stumbled on this listing, and it was like finding an old friend. We bought this fan 20 years ago, and it runs today as the day it was installed. It has been, obviously, very reliable for us. As to being ""noisy."" It is certainly not as quiet as the Hunter fans we have, but they make no discernible sound other than that of moving air. This fan does have the very subdued sound of a motor running, but it is certainly not prominent enough for me to really care."
3,Returned the fan,"The fan was a disappointment for 4 reasons and we returned it. The motor had a loud humm when running, the lamp socket is a miniature base with very limited CFL choices, there was annoying vibration noise, and the fan produced very little breeze."
4,Great fan but buyer beware,"We installed this fan in our galley kitchen. Don't let the small size fool you - it moves a lot of air! Our only complaint is that the lights need to have the candelabra base. We were not aware of this before ordering this fan, or we would never have bought this fan. My hubby ended up converting the candelabra bases to standard light bulb size but now we need to find a new globe that will fit. The breeze from this fan is worth the extra aggravation, though - if you don't mind the small light bulb base then you will be very pleased with this!"
1,"Pretty, but ineffective","This is an attractive little fan, but it doesn't move much air. Even on top speed there is only a faint breeze right underneath it, and no movement at all even four feet out. I also did not want to use the light, but there was no cover plate included for the bottom of the light connection box. Installation was easy, and instructions are complete, but it's not worth the effort. A major disappointment."
3,Disappointed,"This is a petitie ceiling fan. However when you put it on the highest setting the whole ceiling mounting shakes and the fan makes noise.I was looking for a petite, energy saving, noiseless, inexpensive ceiling fan and got a petite, inexpensive and noisy ceiling fan.If I didn't pay an electician to install it for me I would return it."
3,looks like a fan,"looks great in my tiny bath and easy to install but, doesn't circulate as much air as i hoped. maybe it's not the right solution for the space."
5,"quiet, then noisy, then not","Aug 29 2011No complaints with this fan for the first few months. At first I thought it was water running somewhere else in the house, but I isolated the noise to the fan. But that's what the noise sounds like -- like your sprinklers are on or someone is taking a shower. I have it on the lowest speed setting. It is a steady noise, but it still a little distracting.Oct 29 2012Been using the fan almost daily all summer and no noise. Oddly, I think the noise was coming from the glass light enclosure vibrating with the fan motor. The noise was so even, I did not suspect this, but since I tightened the little finger screws again, I have not had any more noise issues. I have upgraded this product to 5 stars."
3,Packaging sucks,"I haven't had a problem with noise. We installed it and it's silent. However, the mushroom glass light fixture came in broken, and I can't find anywhere on amazon's website to just request a replacement fixture. I don't want to send back the entire item. The fixture wasn't packaged well at all. Just wrapped in a plastic bag. The fan itself works great for the living room, and it would have gotten five stars if it had come intact. We purchased a plastic fixture locally for what we were hoping would be a temporary fix."
4,Nice little fan,"The fan is small but does the job, the light is a candlelabra style light which has a very small base and is hard to find a light bulb to fit, not much light given off th 60 watt bulbOther than that it is nice."
2,France versus China,"The knives are not bad - although they certainly need sharpening at once before the first usage. The handles are comfortable and they look great. In two weeks, however, I've already had two sets of these knives and am negotiating with Amazon about getting the third replacement. The problem is the block made in China - this time it certainly does not mean even the remotest sense of quality. First time, the block did not have an appropriate hole for the sharpener tool, second time the block was already broken when I opened the box. What really amazes me is that Amazon this time has not been really efficient in helping to resolve these problems. So, if you'd like to risk and get these knives like I did for $69.99, you might just be lucky and get a block that has all the right holes for knives and sharpener. If not, - you've been warned!"
3,Cartoon City,"The story takes place in present day Ireland, where we follow the day to day of Myles a sub-editor at the local paper. At times I sympathize with the main character and others when I dislike him greatly. It is hard to be completely supportive of him because he has a few ethical problems. The book has a few unexpected turn of events and that makes the read easy and pleasant. The author's use of Irish slang and phrases is a bit confusing at times but the point is still conveyed well."
3,Not for the beginner,"This is not a book for the beginner. I was hoping to find more direction on what type of plants to use together and during which season. Perhaps if I knew more about gardening it would be more useful. I continue to buy and research and learn, and hope this book will come in handy in the future. The pictures are beautiful and the book itself is easy to read, just definitely not for the beginner."
5,Great Read!,"I am thoroughly enjoying reading this book, and I know it will be invaluable to me as a continuing reference source."
1,No Power and No Grab,The people who make the Loctite series of products should be ashamed of this stuff. I couldn't get it to hold a piece of wood to a rough concrete wall. The concrete and wood provided more than enough surface friction for the product to hold. So I scraped off the PowerCrap and threw the remainder of the tube in the trash. I then did what I should've done in the first place. I went to the store and bought a tube of Liquid Nails.
3,Not Overly Impressed,"I have used this product as well as the TUB SURROUND version and I have to say that I am not overly impressed. The claim of ""immediate tackiness"" is not quite accurate. It took a longer time that implied to ""set-up"". While I am a fan of other Loctite products, these adhesives could be a lot better. When making a decision to buy a product like this at the hardware store, one usually only has the product label to go on. This one was lacking."
3,"""instant grab"" not","The ""instant grab"" claim on the label is exaggerated. I attempted to use the product for attaching wood baseboard, and needed a product with quick tackiness and set time. This product did not work well for this application."
1,Weak glue - poor quality control,"Loctite Power Grab Glue failed with very little weight. I cleaned and prepared both sides of treated lumber (dry surface). After more than a week of cure time, I bumped the joint by accident and it fell apart! I re-read the instructions and prepared a test piece of 2 boards glued together with almost every square inch covered. I let this one cure for more than a week as well, but before I got to test the strength I accidentally dropped the boards on the floor from about 20"" and the glue failed again! There was still dried glue on both sides in some places and only on one side in other places. This means the failure was both the bond strength and the internal glue strength. From reading the reviews it sounds like the glue is inconsistent. They must have quality control problems at the manufacturer. (I used polyurethane and Liquid Nails glue in the same application with good results.)"
1,"Neither ""Grabs"" or ""Locks"" ANYTHING!","Tried this product( Loctite Power Grab adhesive) after seeing the (misleading) commercials where a man uses it to put a shelf on a walland it sticks. They should say ""DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME"" in the commercial because the glue doesn't stick to anything and is totallyunreliable for any project requiring even minimal adhesion. I tried it for two simple projects with no weight-bearing required andbetween wood and plastic and there was absolutely NO ADHESION. This is a bogus product. LIQUID NAILS IS FAR BETTER AND MORE RELIABLE.I am returning the tube to Home Depot and complaining to them for selling such a poor product.Don't buy this unless you want to throw money away!"
1,Deceptive listing,"This is currently listed as ""Various Artists"", which made me think it might be other Christian bands doing Switchfoot songs, along the lines of other tribute albums I've seen for U2 and Fleetwood Mac, but it's actually just one band I've never heard of doing all the songs, Dark One Lite. Ever heard of them? Me neither. I haven't listened to it, but I'm afraid to even open it because it's bound to suck and I'd rather just return it to Amazon."
1,See message below.,I was notified that the seller received a part of the external jacket in return mail. I never received the book.
5,Sibling symphonies,"I fully second the opinion that Shosta's 1st and 9th belong together, like kins whose difference of age fails to mask their close similarity of character. Both abound in wit, share a tongue in cheek brashness, and are delightful in a direct way while remaining fairly lightweight. And, rather like Beethoven's two short but fine Op 49 Sonatas, each tends to get lugged in as filler. The 1st ends up either with the 7th, as Bernstein has it, or with the 10th as in Jarvi's case, or with the 6th which was Ashkenazy's choice among others. All three overwhelm it. For the 9th, it's usually the 5th or the bitterly ironic 15th, and again both are too emotionally powerful in comparison to the jazzier, airy 9th. But on top of being perfectly programmed, this 1985 disc captures Haitink in stellar performances with the LPO, his supposed coolness fitting those pieces perfectly. Grab what copies are left: the later reissues are differently set."
3,The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years,"I only bought this because the 80's cover band I'm in is doing ""Born To Be Wild"" and I needed the Lizzy Borden version. I hate the original Steppenwolf version. I have not listened to any other songs on this release...I have seen the movie though."
5,A great book about my home town,I love this book. A great history of the Midway Sunset oil field where I was born and raise. It brings back a lot of memories and is a great read.
4,Disturbing look into cannibalism and ritiual incest.,I read this book years ago but it still gives me a chill when I conjure up some of the imagery. C.M.H. material.
1,not what they advertise!,"I bought this because they advertise it as a paci holder, even in the picture it holds a pacifier,when I got the item both arms look exactly the same and there is no attachment, loop or anything that could possibly hold anything. I am very disappointed and on top of everything I can't return this stupid thing since paying to ship it off would be more expensive than the actual item, I would give it 0 stars if they let me."
3,Not a winner with my grandson,"This is cute - actually looks a bit like my grandson with the tuff of hair, round face and innocent look. There are two problems. One - I think I bought it when he was too old to enjoy it. This is best with a young baby. My grandson was around 7 months.Second and most important , you can only use it with a Nuk pacifier. My grandson wasn't raised with Nuk and so rejected the pacifier as soothing and even as interesting. He uses a pacifier like an old cigar so likes them but not this ""new"" experience.I'll keep it for future babies and it is very cute but the arms are weirdly sewn and over all am disappointed in this product."
2,More like a lovey than a bunny,"Please note - the body on this thing is more like a lovey's body, kind of a blanket. If that's what you're looking for, it's great. Otherwise (I was looking for an actual bunny), get another bunny..."
5,We'd be lost without our bear!!,"Our son loves to cuddle his bear buddy and finding a wayward paci in his crib or carseat it a cinch, making meltdowns less likely to occur. They hold up really well, we just bought the 2nd Bear because -as first time parents who panicked each time the paci touched ANYTHING-we destroyed the velcro after 6 months! Our 2nd bear is 2 months old and the velcro is fine since we've learned not to unhook the paci every two minutes.These are machine washable, hold up to the dryer and come out as good as new! I love that there are no edges or hard pieces on the silly buddy. There's limited stuffing and no string/ribbons so I never worried about putting our son to bed with his bear.I now purchase a silly buddy for every mom to be I know!"
5,works great,We have the pink bunny an my 9 month old loves it. We are super pickey about our pacifiers. We use only http://www.amazon.com/Natursutten-BPA-Free-Natural-Pacifier-Orthodontic/dp/B004YUDA8Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1339620189&sr;=8-2These attach to the bunny well. My daugher loves the bunney ears and rubs them to get herself to sleep or for comfort. Very please with this product. Keeps the pacifier from getting lost without making me nervous the way a pacifier clip with string would. Wish we would have had this for our son.
5,SO cute and SAFE!,I love the Silly Buddy collection because they are thin and safe for babies and toddlers to sleep with. This one has a paci attachment that is fabulous for keeping that paci from getting lost! Highly recommend!
5,Love These!,"We own three for our four month old. He loves them! He's at the stage where he always has a pacifier but also is starting to want to hold on to a blanket. He's too young for a blanket, so these have been working out great! It keeps us from dropping his pacifier and it allows him to hang on to something. We own the frog, the blue bunny, and the puppy. The puppy is my personal favorite. Also, the tag says ""surface washable,"" but I've thrown them in the washing machine multiple times and let them air dry - they've all come out perfectly fine."
3,Not for me...,"Being a beginner at waxing, I didn't know what I was getting with this product. I heard it was better for people who are squeamish of the pain of regular wax, so I thought it would be good. It's a hard wax, which means you can't put it on strips, you spread it on the skin and it hardens, then you peel it off. Sounded better than haggling with strips, right? Wrong.It's hard to determine which consistency is correct, it's much thicker than ordinary wax. When it dries, it also doesn't peel clean off like a strip. If you do it wrong, it just breaks into pieces which I feel is even more painful than strips. I gave it a 3 because part of the problem is probably me, but personally I don't recommend this hard wax for beginners.I'll give it points because while it does leave chunks everywhere, it doesn't leave residue on the skin that is hard to get off."
2,Way too messy,"This product was way to messy to use. This may be because I am not a professional at a salon, but when I tried this by myself at home, the wax was all over the place. As I would dip the stick into the container and pull it out, the wax would drift away into strings which ended up on my table and then instantly hardened. It was just annoying.When I did finally manage to get some on my skin, it definitely did not pull out all of the hairs in one go. I think I'm just going to stick to a salon for now."
3,Recuerdos de Oro - Olga Guillot,It is a nice CD but it was recorded live and the quality of the sound is not that good with several feedback problems that were not edited. The songs are well chosen covering the whole spectrum of Olga Guillot repertoire.
2,I'd pass,"I bought this CD looking for an ""Olga Guillot gretest hits"", it is the first one i get from her. This CD can give you a general idea of the Olga Guillot performance, but the sound is terrible, and the edition worse. I'd try to find another one from her."
3,The Grey Album,"This 1987 album was considered to be the group's breakthrough in the U.S., but personally this is not their finest hour, although the album contains great tracks like ""The Game"" and ""Lips Like Sugar"". I liked the original versions of ""Bedbugs And Ballyhoo"" and ""Over You"" (a.k.a. ""Ship Of Fools""). Ironically, this record led to their downfall. A year later, the group disbanded."
3,Weak effort,"Much more bland, and containing less of the band's identity, than their previous 4 albums or than any of the subsequent albums they put out under this name.Which is not to say there is not some good music in here. ""Lips Like Sugar"" is an effective distillation of the band's floating psychedelia. ""The Game"" is a great song. Most of the rest of this is disposable stuff though. It took them years to slog through making this album ... it was quite a disappointment at the time to those of us who expected greatness from them."
3,When they lost it,"Sometime after recording Ocean Rain, these guys started to lose whatever it was they had for four amazing albums. The voice of the often-annoying Ian McCullough is there, but not the musical trademarks that made the earlier stuff astonishing; the bass lines in particular are gone, and the guitars and melodies lack the drama and intensity they formerly had. Sure, there are a couple of good songs, but overall the album doesn't work. It's sad and mysterious when the muse departs, but that's what apparently happened here."
3,Good until the end,"This book was well-written, interesting, and a good story until the ending. I felt that the ending was a little hokey."
1,Do not purchase!,"I usually don't write reviews, but I felt I had to this time so other consumers would not make the same mistake I did. I read the reviews about it not lasting long and was hoping when I purchased this chocolate fountain that it would just last long enough for 1 graduation party. It didn't even last an hour! The motor (after 30 mins) was starting to make a really loud noise, which we had to turn off. The motor on these units are not well made and it's definitely not worth spending the money on this item. Also, the tiers are made of plastic not stainless steel like the base of the fountain."
3,"It worked well, but doesn't flow evenly","I guess for the price it was good, but it flows unevenly, It's hard to get level"
3,A little dissapointed,"I was on a waiting list for over a month for this book then it was ""lost"" by my mail carrier so I had been waiting a while and the anticipation was not met by what was inside.There is a section on homemade gifts but really nothing new. There is also a big chapter on peoples shared Christmas memories, while sweet it was not what I wanted to pay for. There havent been any recipes in here that I have tried yet so I guesse that its not that memorable of a book.Get Jolly Hollidays instead, that is an awesome book."
5,My daughter loves this series,"Written in the mid-20th century, the Ginny Gordon series is a relic of earlier times. My daughter received the second book in the series (Ginny Gordon and the Missing Heirloom) as a Christmas gift <yes, my kids get 'rare' books as gifts>, and read it at least five times before we received the other four books in the series from Amazon sellers.The plots are similar to those in the Trixie Belden books, and are aimed at a younger audience than Nancy Drew or Cherry Ames (both of whom were late teens/early twenties through the course of the series), and involve minor crimes missing candlesticks, secret romances of older characters. No violence, no sexual activity, in all an inoffensive series that is most definitely a product of its time."
1,Disappointing - doesn't last,Movie doesn't play in sync. Sounds/voices come after the actions. Very distracting to try to watch...looks like a really bad lip sync job. Plays fine on other DVD players. I'd pass on this model..you get what you pay for!
1,Piece of junk,"the worst item i ever bought on amazoni wish i would have got my money back for this dvd playerthe movies always skip, there a lot of distortioncolby should slap themselves in the face for releasing this product."
1,Pure Junk...do not buy,This product was pure junk. I have had a Coby DVD player before and it was fine. I bought this one and it was cheap for an upconversion dvd player and was fine when i first installed it. After playing 3 DVD's this thing broke. To get warranty coverage by Coby I have to pay $18 shipping and handling. I bought this for $30 so it hardly seems worth it. I will never buy Coby again......I couldnt return to the store because it was after the return policy......Coby sucks
5,Could Not Put It Down,"Yes, it is lengthy, and yes, it suspends reality on the subject of Irene's ability to cause the Forsyte men to fall in love with her; nevertheless, I am hooked, and will be so sorry when these last fifty pages are read!If you want to read a generational story that does not include lots of steamy or bloody scenes, but rather mentions them in passing, this is the one for you. True, once or twice I have wished there had been more discussion: people's reactions to trysyts, to deaths, to surprises... but taken as a whole, the book really does strike the note that time swallows, or at least blurs, so much familial pain.Read the book. If you are watching the Masterpiece Theatre produciton, the book will matter to you even more. And yes, the book is better! Though the actor who portrays Soames is pretty yum, in real life!"
3,"All Decathlon, All The Time...","The production values in this film are excellent. However, Greenspan missed an opportunity to present the awe-inspiring stories of the athletes who labor in obscurity in the lesser-known sports, whose only reward is the chance to be noticed once every four years in the Olympic Games. Instead, he focused on the marquee sports such as athletics, swimming, and women's gymnastics, whose athletes already fill the covers of Sports Illustrated every week. But if you really want to watch Mary Lou Retton plant that ""Vault Without Fault"" one more time, this film is for you."
2,"missing carl lewis, lougainis, jordan, basketball","How the creators of this film could leave out the performances of the US basketball team led by Jordan, Carl Lewis' domination and Lougainis' efforts is beyond me. Considering this is supposed to be the official film of LA 84 you'd think they'd show events that the games were known for. This film is incredibly unbalanced and overrated. For a more balanced film get the one that covers the first century of the modern olympics. Also many of these official films of sporting tournaments don't show highlights at their best angles and speeds which typically are how they're portrayed on TV but rather as the ""artiste"" film director shows them. Too many shots are up close and in slow motion and gives you no concept of the overall competition. In the end you have a director putting his stamp on the film more so than the athletes themselves which is the height of arrogance and the potential incompatibility of art and sport."
5,A long-overdue legal reference book,"Dr. Wear-Finkle has succeeded in creating an extremely well-written, comprehensive reference book of a generally unfamiliar and very intimidating subject to most clinicians. Her approach is impressive in both its clarity and organization. While it is an easy read, it goes beyond a ""...for Dummies"" approach. This excellent reference is worth the time investment to read in its entirety. After reading it, a physician has a greater respect, and less unfounded fear, of lawsuits. Dr. Wear-Finkle provides simple, common sense, and some not-so-obvious tips on avoiding litigation, as well as sound advice on what to do when litigation occurs. It is appropriate addition to any clinician's library."
5,FANTASTIC,"This is one of the easiest programs I've ever seen - the ""pop out"" idea is brilliant. I've tried Wiatt's recipes, too, and they're simple and delicious. She's motivating and positive and most of all, real. A great book!"
1,Just terrible quality,"Yeah, I know. Hard to expect much quality for $30 but these binoculars are so cheaply made and the optics are so mediocre that it is hard to justify a reputed seller like Amazon selling this junk. Unless you think that 30 bucks is all the money you would want to spend on a pair of binoculars for the rest of your life, I would strongly advise against buying this product. Check the couch for some loose change, ask your family/spouse for some extra allowance or wait a few weeks to collect another $30 or $40 and get something decent like the Nikon 7X35 action or even better, the 6X30 Leupold Yosemite.By the way, there are many variations of this model with Bushnell, Nikon tags but it is essentially the same cheap 8X25 Chinese binocular, so beware."
1,Don't buy this item!!!,"If they say Nvidia on the bridge, but the bridge does not support Nvidia, then we have a problem. I feel these guys are trying to make easy money by making low priced items assuming that buyers will just write it off.....sorry I don't play that game! They are taking they're piece of crap back and refunding me. I know ho to configure SLI. And this item does not support it.....Don't waste your time and your money.Note: See other reviews regarding this item also..."
1,Item in bad condition and bad packed.,"I received this item in a box very bad packed, with no protection at all for this piece, including scratches on its band. I installed it and it does not work. Now If I ask for a replacement, I think I am going to receive a new one in the same condition. I don't get confidence for this provider anymore. At this moment I bought and received another brigde from another provider with no trouble. It was wasted time and wasted money for this purchase!!."
3,Xylitol cinnamon gum,There are better flavors of xylitol gum. The cinnamon loses its flavor very quickly. I love cinnamon but the flavor just wasn't strong enough for me. I prefer the peppermint.
2,Hollywood Pictures needs to fire their subtitlers.,"You would think a Blu-Ray release would have excellent subtitles..You want to see what Julieta & Carlos are talking about, in the black & white movie playing at the beginning.¡Carlos, ten cuidado! Te quiero, Carlos, te quiero.NOPE...(Speaking in Spanish)You want to sing....Requiem aeternum dona EvitaRequiem aeternum dona EvitaRequiem Evita, Requiem EvitaSalve regina mater misericordiaeVita dulcedo et spes nostraSalve salve reginaAd te clamamus exules filii EvaAd te suspiramus gementes et flentesO clemens o pia....NOPE...(Choir singing in Latin)Hollywood Pictures, get off your mickey mouse butt & release a proper Blu-ray release of EVITA.Evita: The Criterion Collection on Blu-ray. And don't forget to include the complete Subtitles..We want to sing along, Damn it!I only bought this for the Making of... featurette, & a better picture..."
2,"Two for Antonio, not, the you know what","Boy was I ever disappointed with Evita. The songs are terrible (except for ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" and ""You Must Love Me""), so overly worded, and they do nothing to advance what little story there is. I'm still dumbfounded as to what exactly Eva Peron did for her country. From what I could gather from Madonna's close to home performance, was sleep her way to the top. (I fail to understand why the people of Argentina didn't like the choice of Madonna as their favorite first lady...she seems to fit the role perfectly). The one pleasant surprise of the movie was how wonderful Antonio Banderas was. I never knew he could sing as good as he looks! Give him his own musical. Don't make him play second fiddle to the you know what."
3,What? No anamorphic widescreen?,"I remember seeing 'Evita' in the theaters when it came out in '98, and recently bought a home theater projector so thought I'd rent this film and watch it again.So, here's a warning to those with widescreen TVs or projectors: This movie is widescreen but it is *not* anamorphic - that is, the picture doesn't widen to fill your whole TV screen. It was released when most people owned square TV sets, so the widescreen image is set within a standard 4:3 ratio square. In other words, if you try to watch this movie on your widescreen TV what you'll get is a square TV image with the widescreen image inside of it - MUCH smaller than an anamorphic image.A pity really, because it's not a bad movie. I'm baffled as to why they never remastered the film and gave it an anamorphic release; it's been ten years..."
5,Evita,"The first time I saw Evita, I hated it. Then, I decided to watch it once more, and I found myself consumed. Not only is a wonderful and interesting story told, but the songs and the music is wonderful. The movie is so powerful! I had chills during the ""Santa Evita"" scene, in which Eva is at church being serinaded as a saint, while Che is running from being beaten by the police. All the actors gave a great performance, and Alan Parker did a great job. I would most definately recommend the musical...Evita!"
2,Go see the play,"While I'm not an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, I was looking forward to the release of this adaptation of one of his better works. Sadly it left me cold. In adapting the play for the big screen, the authors took the edge from the plot. Their biggest mistake was to make Eva a sympathetic character. Except for Banderas's performance (ever noticed he sounds kinda like Niel Diamond impersonating Ricky Ricardo) this movie is a nicely filmed waste of time."
1,Never rec'd it; can't review it.,"I never received this dvd so I cannot review it. I did receive an AC/DC video that someone in Pennsylvania had ordered for a recipient in Newfoundland. I notified Amazon and returned the missent dvd but I have received neither a refund nor any other information about this item that was ordered more than a month ago nor can I find anyone in customer service who seems interested in helping me beyond the ""I am sorry. We are getting lots of calls like these.""So it's interesting that Amazon now wants me to review a product that I was charged for and never received. Oh - I did get a confirmation that the DVD I was sent was returned. My refund was marked as $0."
1,frustrated,I did not know certain videos were for certain regions this DVD does not play on any of our machines except the lap top rather frustrating.
1,Worst Movie Ever seen,"Don't waste your time on this. Its good I saw some of it on cable, cause if I'd paid for this I'd still be crying."
1,Evita,"This review says it must be 20 words longs... Should I write Awful, 20 times, no make that 100 times.Why OH would Hollywood Films/ Robert Stigwood release such dark, dank garbage. Outside of Banderas singing ""what A Circus""Madonna as usual is a star without any talent, both physical and vocally and yet she was reached the pincale of success.My copy of this film goes directly to the garbage, it's not worth the space on my shelf."
1,See it on stage instead!! (>_<),What did they do to this MUSICAL!?! I know Madonna tried but I am sorry...She does not have the voice that is needed for Evita..I won't even make a comment about Antonio's singing *shudder* Andrew Lloyd Webber needs to get his head checked for allowing them to make such an atrocity of his play... I preformed the Mitress when I was 16 and I KNOW what the singing is supposed to sound like and the movie DID NOT come close!!
1,Avoida,"She can't sing. She can't act. She can't dance. All she can do is market herself and talk about her ""art,"" something genuine artists almost never do. I will throw her this one tiny crumb: she should wear the brown contacts more often."
2,Boring!,This is one of or if not Madonna's most boring and uniteresting films that she has ever done. The film had high expectations and the first night it was released in theaters the place was packed. By the second half of the film more than half the audience was asleep. I was getting pretty bored myself. I think this is a lacklustre movie and a waste of money. The entire film is nothing but song and at the very end there is finally some dialogue. That was the dialogue that won Madonna an accolade. If you must see this film expect to yaaaaawn all the way!
2,"Good music, made poorly","I enjoy the music from Evita very much, but the movie gets really boring aftet the first 1/2 hour. It is well cast, but the things like the sung dialouge really are a hurt to this could be good moive. Actually this is probably and excellent adaptation of the stage show to the screen. The show isnt that good anyway."
1,I highly suspect I'm sent an illegal copy,"I bought this for collection purpose. I've seen this many times before. That's why I did not even open the package after received it. Just now, I thought I should try this and see how good the DVD is. Judging from the quality of the image and sound, I highly suspect I'm sent an illegal copy of this produced from a poor downloaded version of the movie. The picture is blurry at best and the sound has a noticeable background noise. I'm no amateur and I know what quality should a DVD has. Well, STAY AWAY is my verdict on this. You'll get better quality by downloading it online (i.e., itunes)."
5,5 Stars All the way,The only thing I have to say about the movie is that you will cry during the movie because Alan Parker did an excellent job at directing this movie!!!! 5 stars all the way!!!!
3,"If they dubbed Madonna, it would be improved","Plays, books, and movies are always adapted to fit the media. Many times this can be an advantage. Modifying the story is a producer's privilege. The photograph was superb. And the period consumes gave a feel of authenticity. The kept the Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice musical pretty much in tact. However when Madonna usurped ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"" this contributed to the loss of the consistency of the story.The addition of the Navel Cadets' revolt was a good touch and improved on the authenticity of the story. However, the essence of the movie like the play is the singing. Madonna is the only person that has no range, and cannot even talk through a song. If only they dubbed her, the movie would be worth viewing. Maybe they can adjust this on a DVD.Evita: The Complete Motion Picture Music Soundtrack"
3,I thought it was the most interesting story ever!,The movie was excellent but I don't like Madonna as an actress therefore I give it 3 stars! Antonio is hot I love that guy! He is the envy of all gay men!!! Rainbow flag all the way!!!
3,Now I remember,"I like all kinds of musicals.But not this one.I forgot that and bought the Bluday.The reason I hated this one is because1. Madonna doesn't fit the roll since she was already too old at that time.2. Antonio's commentary like singing bothered me a lot.Also I prefer music + dialogue better than all music musical.The picture is perfect. It's pure HD.The sound is HD too and seems very well transfered. But not well divided into 5 channel.If you like this mobie, get the bluray.If not, don't make a mistake like me."
4,Captures the personality,the stage musical is brought successfully to the screen. This movies captures the woman and her times. Banderas is the perfect foil to Madonna's Evita.
5,I hate musicals,"I really enjoyed this movie. I just saw it tonight and was taken aback by how believable Madonna was and how WONDERFUL Antonio Bandarres was. I do believe Antonio should have recieved something as he was just as important as Madonna. A great movie, and for someone who hates musicals, and is not Madonna's hugest fan..That says something.I did notice something was pretty funny about the movie. Madonna and Eva Peron were identicle in a lot of ways. Promiscuous, used sex to get to the top, and were powerful figures in their societies.Kind of makes you laugh at all the controversy huh."
2,Hmm...,"I'm not the biggest fan of musicals. I generally find them kind of annoying and pointless. But, seeing as I had to watch this film for Spanish class, why not review it?I didn't like this movie. Nor do I like Madonna. She has this air about her that screams ""I'm here and you're not"", ignoring her star status. She doesn't connect with the woman she's portraying, Eva Peron. Antonio Banderas is in a interesting situation, playing varying characters with different perspectives, but that doesn't save ""Evita"". I found this to be a very boring film. I don't recommend it unless you're a diehard Madonna fan or a diehard fan of musicals."
2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it","It was with the cast album of Evita (NOT Superstar, which I've always considered just a collection of pop songs strung together) that I fell in love with Lloyd Webber. This movie (Hollywood can't keep its hands to itself) is embarrassingly bad IF you know the original. The actors look silly. Che's songs are divided up among other cast members. Lyrics are changed and deleted. Songs are rearranged and given to different characters from the show. I hated it. But. If you do not know the original, you might like it a lot. It has a story, and the music is just out of this world, no matter who sings it or with what desecrated lyrics."
2,"Evita, ok flows lousy","The movie flows very lousy, I almost turend off the movie. THere are the good songs. I reccomend listing for the songs. They could use someone other than Madonna"
5,Great,"I haven't heard the original cast recording so I can't compare this to it but, I think this is a very good movie/musical. Madonna and Antonio Banderas did a great job! The music is really good.This musical is not as good as The Phantom of the Opera but it is hard to be better than Phantom. You MUST see EVITA!"
4,evita,"I really liked the movie, I'd forgotten there is no talking only singing but it works.This movie is probably only for people with an interest in Evita herself or someone who likes Madonna or Antonio Banderas, but that's just a guess on my part."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though some of Evita's musical numbers have some flash, the movie feels overlong and oversimplified; there is definitely a movie to be made about the controversial Eva Peron, but this isn't it."
4,A star-making performance.,"Evita starring Madonna is her best performance ever! She truly looks like Eva Peron, her voice has never sounded better and there's no trace of the ""material girl"" anywhere in sight. Antonio Banderas also stars, who knew this guy could sing his heart out. The songs are gorgeous and the cinematography is breathtaking. The only problem I have with Evita is their is no dialogue, it is just song after song but the songs are good. Give Evita a viewing soon."
4,A Good Movie Adaptation...,"...although perhaps not as great as the original stage version. But I supposed that is not a fair statement to make as they are two completely different mediums. Actually, the original concept album was best if we want to get picky about it. As for Madonna being cast as Evita, I thought, ""Of course, who else?"" After all, Patty Lupone would have been too old for the part unless they cartooned away her age via CGI as another reveiwer suggested. I enjoyed this movie and Madonna did a fine job. It has been a long time since any musicals, let alone psuedo-rock operas, have been made into movies."
5,Evita (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray],"LOVE THIS MOVIE MADONNA NEVER FORGET OPENING NIGHT WAITING IN LINE TO SEE IT.MADONNA DESERVES AN OSCAR FOR THIS PERFORMANCE. STUNNING MOVIE CAST WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT. AWESOME MOVIE FOR SOUND, DIRECTION,LOCATION AND THE COSTUMES ARE TO DIE FOR. A TRUE HIGHLY RICH FILM THAT IS AN INSTANT CLASSIC.AWESOME IN BLU RAY HIGH DEF!!!THE EXTRA'S ARE GREAT AS WELL.LOVE ANDREW LLOYD WEBER MUSICALS!"
5,BREATHTAKING!!!!!!,"MADONNA in a movie and singing! What more could a person ask for? Okay, perhaps some people aren't as big of a Madonna fan as I am, but this movie was right on the money. There is no one that could have played Eva Peron the way that Madonna did. She completely captured the character, and was wonderful in the movie. Madonna won the Golden Globe for this movie, and it was deserved!There are so many beautiful scenes in this movie, so I cannot pick just one, but I recommend this movie to anyone that likes Madonna, is interested in South American history (keep in mind this is a musical though-but I think it gives a great portrayal of Eva Peron), or to any movie buff (or musical fan)!"
5,Evita is a must see!,"For the past five years I have been obssessed with the musical, Evita, and the woman. When I heard that Madonna and Antonio Banderas were to star in the movie adaptation of Evita, I was thrilled. With such a fantastic cast and crew, I had high expectations of the film. I saw Evita for the first time at the St. Louis premiere of the film and I was not disappointed. Madonna did a great job playing Evita. I did miss the belting voice of Patti LuPone, however. Antonio Banderas did the best vocals of any Che I have heard. And Jonathan Pryce delivered an emotional performance. Evita is a must see! END"
3,Evita,"The early development of Evita to her final role is slow and tedious. I am not fond of Madonna, but her performance was very good. The DVD did follow history very well, and some of the scenes were remarkable. Of course the famous song, Dom't Cry for Me, Agentina raises this from a three star to a four star film."
2,They changed the lyrics,"As someone who saw the original touring Evita in Austin during the 1980's, and practically memorized the original Broadway cast recording, I found this presentation of the work rather jarring and disappointing. Many of the lyrics have been changed or sanitized, perhaps to satisfy the censors in Argentina so the film could be shot there. The complete elimination of Peron's last mistress before Evita, and the transfer of her agonized lament ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"" to Madonna, was a poor decision and changes the whole concept of that song. Overall, the orchestral arrangements have too ""pop"" a flavour, and disgard the lush original score. If you want to get a REAL feel for the impact of ""Evita"", get the original recording with Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin."
5,movie evita,I just love this movie...the music and Antonio Banderas and Madonna! Like the history to it as well. Buy it.
5,Superb in Every Way,"First, let me say, the way this film was dismissed during its original release was a disgrace. It deserved many Oscar nominations including one for Bandaras and Madonna. Bandaras stole every scene he was in and Madonna rose to the occasion in a role that is very daunting to play. The harshest and dumbest comment by critics was ""The longest music video"". Guess what? The piece is sung completely. That is the way it was written and to do it any other way would have been an insult to the original creative team. Mr. Parker's direction and the screenplay are far superior to the stage version. The stage version is vacuous and uninvolving and the current version in New York now makes that even more apparant. Mr. Weber's best work was given the treatment it deserved on screen and the Blu Ray is stunning in sight and sound."
4,"madonna's talent shines throughout ""evita""","The movie Evita is a wonderful musical to not only watch but to listen to as well. Madonna not only looked like Evita Peron, but she truly was Evita in this film.Her voice was great and her acting was even better. This movie has many emotions, which you can feel within each song. Antonio Bandera also is a great actor in this movie, and I for one enjoyed how he was always there to ""fill in"" the viewers about the movie. My favorite scene had to be when Madonna sings ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"". It is a very beautiful scene of the movie. And the song is very beautiful as well. I reccomend that you should see this movie musical tonight."
5,Awsome!,"If you're into drama and musicals, this is a great movie for your collection! I've seen this dozens of times and it's one of my favorite films of all time! Really wonderful depiction of Eva Peron!"
3,Madonna??????,The movie was good but I just couldn't get over the fact that they hired Madonna. I mean people should think before they totally trash a legend. There are alot of talented Latino actress' that would have done a wonderful job with this part. Antonio Banderas was great in this film. He has a magnificient voice and I hear he is going to play the phantom of the opera for his next musical which should be good. I hate movies that focus on the actor or actress more so than the story. Which is what happened with this movie. Take a hint from LOTR. Hire an unknown and make a better movie.
4,Evita the film - underrated and and underappreciated,"Please read no further, if you are concerned about spoilers....Before royalty and quasi-royalty like Kate Middleton, Princess Diana, and Jackie Onassis, there was mid 20th century ""superstar"" Eva Peron. Though I am NOT a fan of Madonna, this film and Madonna's performance in it have been underrated and underappreciated (Antonio Banderas also does a fine job.). Be that said, it would have been wonderful if the film could have found a way to incorporate more background information on why the figure of Eva Peron is so controversial. It could too easily leave people with the impression that controversies are little deeper than mistakes of Eva's early years."
4,Good movie,I bought it for a friend who really wanted it. He stopped looking when he say the same video for $40.00. I didn't tell him how little I paid for it so I got more brownie points than I should have.
5,Antonio Banderas steals the show.,"Antonio Banderas' performance as Che was simply amazing. His facial expressions, snide observations, and powerful singing voice were consistently good during the entire duration of the film. The best songs that he sang are: The Lady's Got Potential, Good Night and Thank You, and O, What A Circus."
5,An EPIC Broadway Film...,"It is incredible some people love to hate the film because of Madonna or they complain abotu not being excatly like the broadway production...people chill. the film and soundtrack are amazing, the acting epic and directing, well its an epic film all around."
5,One of the BEST movies EVER!,"I have been showing Evita in my Spanish classes for years. I love to hear my students moan and groan when I tell them it's a musical, about a dead lady, a cancer story, a political drama. They dread it. Then, when the movie starts and I fill them in on some of the actual history behind it - and we watch YOUTUBE clips of Eva Peron - before it's over my students are all shaking white handkerchiefs and taking off their jackets to signify they are ""descamisados."" Madonna, if you should read this, my students and I would like to say ""thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you""...AWESOME JOB...one of the best movies ever made in the history of cinema.Lee NocellaRamsay High SchoolBirmingham, AL"
5,To be enjoyed over and over again,Evita is a favorite show of mine. This is a fantastic story of a fantastic woman. The movie has been done very tastefully. Madonna has portrayed the part wonderfully. The music is superb. This is one DVD that one would enjoy over and again. It is a pity that Madonna did not get an academy award for this movie.
2,picture and sound could be better,"Really, this DVD looks like a direct laser disc transfer. I watched this in theaters so I had expected a certain ""look"". Just wasn't there. Now I have quite a number of DVDs and I know about calibrating the monitor. This one threw off my settings. The songs, I think, sound better in stereo. They sound unnatural in multichannel.There is also the dearth of extras in the DVD. Not even of the ""cast and crew"" type.This movie on its own is watchable and collectible enough that it needs a better DVD."
4,"Good, But You Need Patti Lupone","Madonna is fine as Evita. She's hip, she's cool and looks very much like Eva Peron. Her voice is okay, however the voice of the original Broadway Eva, Patti Lupone is much better.Antonia Bandares gives an Oscar worthy performance as Che and even though the title ""Pop Opera"" is more for the original Mandy Patankin, and the term ""Hispanic Opera"" is more for Bandares.In all the film is very good. The music and lyrics are superb and the art direction, cinematography and script are even better! You have to cry for Argentina if you have never see Evita and want to."
1,9.99boycott,"Boycott kindle books priced over 9.99. No printing cost, no paper cost, no binding cocy, cannot give away or trade, over 9.99 is an abuse."
3,"Mahler's 6th is not my favorite piece, but the Ruckert songs are beautifully sung","Christa Lugwig is a great interpreter of many things, the Ruckert Lieder being just one of them. A great joy."
5,THE SECOND PART IS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST!!,"I really enjoyed following Kane on his adventure. There is a very strong plot line in the story, with lots of action, and even a love story thrown in for good measure. If you like series, this is a must read. I can't hardly wait for the next part to come out. I highly recommend this book! If you like westerns...you will love this. ~bev bozman~"
1,WHAT?????????????????,"Who the hell made this album? P. Diddy ain't dead. Sure this album has his best songs, like ""All About The Benjamins"", but so what. This album should be called ""Greatest Hits"", not ""Tribute To P. Diddy."""
1,diddy was'nt thew first to sample,"why everybody talks about diddy jacking beats is nonsense rapfans who been there since 79 know for a fact that sugarhill gang, grandmaster flash, nwa, geto boys, 2pac, snoop have all sampled beats there is'nt a rapper around since then and now who has'nt sampled check out the james brown, and parliament-funkadelic websites to see how many people sampled them anyway diddy has enough going for him already why put this out because somebody wanna cash in on diddy."
4,Fascinating book on the minutia of Gabon,"Admittedly, I am fascinated by books about jungles and Africa. I you are the sort of person who wants to learn more about the colonization and state of affairs in Gabon in the 1960s, this is the book for you. The book is well written. The version that I read is an English translation of a book originally published in Dutch. The book reads well and thus I assume that it is well translated. The author manages a long journey down a major river system in Gabon and meets some interesting people along the way. The characters in the text, either historical figures or individuals encountered by Brokken in his travels in Gabon, come alive and capture the reader's imagination. This is not a book for every reader but if you are interested in arm chair adventure and equatorial Africa, buy this little gem. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
5,Groundbreaking punk/HC album,"This record somehow still sounds fresh and powerful almost thirty years after its release - a near-miracle of crystal-clear production and bristling tension. This record straddles the boundary between punk and hardcore; the tunes are mostly snarled, and sometimes off-beat, and the lyrics can have an almost visionary quality. When I heard it played during its debut week (at a college Tower Records), everyone seemed to stop still in their tracks.This LP eschews melody for a kind of punk poetry - an approach more famously employed by fellow L.A. rockers X. But while X's songs were always informed by a rockabilly flavor, The Germs are almost indescribably disorganized and intense. Nut unlike their live gigs, there's that sense that everything is going to break apart at any moment. The production by Joan Jett helps keep the whole thing going.It's easy to use the usual stream of adjectives to describe a favored record. This is one where the superlatives may very well fit."
5,A peek to an era when advertising art was lively yet simple,"Officially licensed by Lionel itself, The Art Of Lionel Trains: Toy Trains And American Dreams by Roger Carp is more than just a simple showcase of promotional art that the Lionel company used to advertise their classic model locomotives; its informed and informative text follows the journey and evolution of the internationally famous model railroading company and its various products that inspired hobbies and dreams in households across America. Illustrated throughout in full color and a highly recommended addition to any personal or community library Railroading History collection, The Art Of Lionel Trains is as much a trip down memory lane for model train buffs as it is a peek to an era when advertising art was lively yet simple."
3,The West Germany original cd is Bettter,"The sound on this SACD is good, not great. And in doing a comparison with the West Germany target cd, the SACD is inferior."
4,Back on the Chain Gang,"""Chain Gang"" is one of my favorite recordings and would make this CD worthwhile if it weren't already chock full of other good songs (even the one Rush Limbaugh appropriated for his radio theme)."
5,"I've got a smile, for everyone I meet","Many will disagree with me, but for me this is THE Pretenders album. The songwriting, musicianship, and lyrics which showed so much raw talent in the first two Pretenders albums are overflowing here. On this album, black and white turns to color. This is their Rubber Soul, their Pet Sounds, their Parallel Lines. It's where the rubber meets the road. Whereas the first two albums have some (sorry) filler in the form of extended jams and obscure experiments, this is a self-contained unit that doesn't pander, always entertains, and never disappoints. Oh, and the remastered sound and packaging are great, too. This may be the single best ten dollars you spend all year."
3,Ok,"The high points of CD are some, but there are some low points, too. The high points are: My City Was Gone(which in case your'e wondering is Rush Limbaugh's theme), Middle Of The Road, and Back On The Chain Gang. The low points are: Watching The Clothes, which is a silly song about sitting in laundromat, I Hurt You, Thumbelina, and just about every other song on the album. I gave this album a whole 3 stars because the high points are really high, in spite of the lows."
4,Couple Hits,"There are a couple good hits (""My City was Gone"" and ""Back on the Chain Gang""), a couple so-so (""Middle of the Road"", ""Time the Avenger"" and ""Watching the Clothes""), but that is about it. A good greatest hits, but that is about it."
1,Query,"not interested in writing another review, just think you should know that the same person wrote 5 reviews using a different name each time in response to one of mine."
1,yep i checked,"Arcadius is right, The author or a fan or employee writes multiple reviews with different logins, I got this book used at my shop for free(I over payed) I want the twenty minute back off my life this nit stole to realize how bad this book was.I have read anti-pagan and pro-christian that wear clearly slanted but at least they wear written well.This is just Badly written. And dose a lot of good for the pagan community as it tends to make Christians look like aluminum Foil wearing Fanatical Hate Filled Nut cases. That Can Not Spell Nor Spell Check!Really is that bad."
1,Additionally,"the authors also overlook the 'startling' fact that modern Pagans don't disguise their worship of the ancient Gods at all. They honour the gods under exactly the same names and forms as the ancients did. The whole theory of a conspiracy of Pagan deities is ludicrous. We make no secret, and no apologies, of the fact that we worship the Gods who made the West great. Read 'Old Stones, new Temples' by Drew Campbell to see exactly how disguised the Greek religion is!!"
2,whaaa?????,"This is a way of respect for Dr. Dre and I do understand but Dre's songs should never ever be covered by anyone else. Don't get me wrong, these guys are all good rappers in here but they need to go off and make a revised cover of all Ja Rule's and Murphy Lee's songs because I know that they would make them better than Rule or Murph could ever do. The only reason that this album bothered me is because it is out of place. Not hearing Dre or Snoop do these songs just doesn't go well and it feels like something is out of place. Good try though, I'm serious, go ahead and do whatever else you want but please leave Dre out."
4,So far it's been OK.,"This USB to PS/2 converter allows me to use my old KVM switch. It turned out that the model I ordered had been replaced by a new model. The delivery company emailed me to make sure that I was OK with receiving the new model before they shipped it to me. Very good customer service. So far everything has been great with one exception. This device seems to have a little trouble in a KVM environment. It will occasionally (once every few days) lose connectivity when plugged into my laptop's docking station, which is connected to my KVM switch. The USB port stops recognizing the device for some reason. However, if I plug the device directly into my laptop, it works consistently, without any issues. Would I buy this item again, sure. For the price, the occasional inconvenience can be tolerated."
4,...,This is a great first book by Amy Blankenship. The world she introduses us to is tantilizing and intriging. The charaters weave a spell that is bound to caputre anyone in thier web no matter what kind of personality you like. ...I am looking forward to exploring the adenvures of this series as it unfolds. I already love the charaters and can't wait to see what is in store for them.One tiny complaint...(intentded as purly construtive ctitisim)... I want more detail and some history. The only confsion I felt was not knowing the history that led up to the battle at the begining of the book...I can already tell that adventure would be a wonderful read. I'm looking forward to it.
5,A Wonderful Read,"The Heart of Time is a wonderful book, painting a picture of romance and intrigue. The action scenes are riveting, keeping you glued to the pages. The characters have a personality all their own. Even with the various clashes of background, the characters seem to melt together in an aurora of color. The reader can amass feelings of sympathy for certain characters and triumph for others. If I could vote higher than five stars I would do so. Once you pick it up, it's nearly impossible to put down."
5,wonderful fantasy story by talented new author,"'The Guardian Heart Crystal Series' has just begun, Amy Blankenship's first installment 'The Heart of Time' is a wonderfully written love story based in fantasy. The characters and plot are very original and captivating, when I received my copy I found I was unable to put it down till I read the entire story in one evening. If this first book is any indication of what we can expect in the future from this talented new author to hit the fantasy scene then I believe we are in for some real entertainment! I would recommend this story to anyone who has an interest in stories based in fantasy."
4,Greatness begins,"Add another half star to the rating. The only thing that keeps it from being a perfect album is Ray Manzarek's sometimes intrusive keyboard noise (full tilt versions of classics like The World's a Mess It's in My Kiss and Nausea, minus the annoying organ, are on the Beyond and Back compilation). But you've got to love the former Door for helping send X on its way to recording four astounding albums. Wild Gift is my fave, but Under the Big Black Sun and More Fun in the New World are also essential. And so is this one. The best band of the early 80s."
4,Sunny California this is not,"This is quite possibly one of the darkest albums of all time. The Sex Pistols were just angry, The Clash championed the working class, but X took the punk sound and told stories of heroin, rape, and other abnormalities that took place in the L.A. underground. This is not the Los Angeles that the news media brought to the masses. The stories they told were not received from some second hand news source, they were first hand witnesses to man's inhumanity to man. ""Los Angeles,"" ""The World's a Mess, Its In my Kiss,"" ""Sex and Dying in High Society,"" and ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline"" are the stand out tracks. As with ""Wild Gift"" the remastered version stands taller when matched up to the previously released version. If you ever doubt that the world is a cruel place, listen to this. The picture you see with their words provides a description that is only a notch below an eyewitness account."
5,arrived in excellent condition,it does what its supposed to do....was properly packaged...... purchased it for a 555 timer charge controller as a final year eeet project
1,Misunderstood,"The title is misleading, at least it was for me. This is a book about psychoanalysis. This book is not for casual reading. I was disappointed."
2,overpriced,"This video offers some useful information, but for the most part it simply reviews several fire making products, water purifying products, etc... it doesn't really discuss in detail any practical skills and the ones that are mention are vague. In my opinion it is over price given the amount of useful info it provides."
2,Wrong Item,"This was UV ink which will not work with the regular ink I use, unless I convert to ALL UV ink."
3,Pet Voyage car seat cover,"I didn't realize that this item didn't have a slit for access to a seatbelt. We always use a car harness when we take our dog on road trips, so I may have to return it."
1,Worst cleansing product I have ever used,"This is the first review I have ever written on a product. I am so disappointed that I had to do this. The main problem is that the brush falls off easily from the handle. I had to fish for it in the dark blue colored toilet. It was badly stuck that i couldnt grab it with my hand, so I had to flush it. Which clogged my toilet. Worst experience ever. I didnt know what to do with my clogged toilet, I pulled up the tank and for some reason it started working. Now, I am worried as to whether the same brush is still stuck inside my drain line and would clog my drain line if i use it in the future. Man, i dont even know if i could eat right now just thinking of what i had to do. worst experience ever!"
5,these work surprisingly well,I was pleasantly surprised by how well these work. They make an unpleasant chore a lot easier.
2,Scrubbing Bubbles Toilet Cleaning,"Was disappointed with this product. It works, but not as well as the Fresh Brush Max Kit. Will not buy again."
1,Pads fall off very easily.,"When I helped clean house for a sick friend of mine a few times, she had a Clorox toilet wand and I liked how easy it was to use and that I only had to store the wand instead of a full brush and caddy. So I decided to get one. But I bought the Scrubbing Bubbles one instead because I had a coupon. What a mistake! The design of this thing is horrible. You need your hands to snap the brush in as securely as possible because of the way it pivots. That means your touching the cleaner, or changing your gloves afterward. Then, you can only gently wipe the bowl with it. If you try to scrub, the brush falls off when you get to a curved part of the bowl. I ended up using 4 brushes to clean two toilets last weekend, and the same this weekend. I also end up getting my hands wet with toilet water as I fish the fallen pads out of the toilet. I hate this product, and do not recommend it to anyone."
4,brush kit,the sc johnson scrubbing bubbles fresh brush starter kit works well for every day but would not recommend for deep cleaning
5,Gospel rap doesn't have to be wack...,"And here is the proof. Cop this and/or 'Leave My Name Out'. Dope emceeing, dope production, and child friendly.Hands down the best purchase I've made as of late."
4,Beautiful Voice Ascar,"Listening to this album, I feel the tone of the voice is so melodic and the timbre so beautifuL. Beautiful songs that are sung by Ascar. No wonder he has such a cult of fans and now I am happy to join. A melodious album of his music.:)"
5,"Compelling, heart wrenching, nail biting storyline.","Walking K is one of those books I read in one sitting, it was almost impossible to put down. It takes a strong hold of your emotions from the very beginning. After, I went back and read some of the best parts again. It was disappointing to run out of pages. DeMott's characters come to life with such vivid intensity. They are real people. It is obvious the Vietnam conflict meant a lot to this author, as his writing reflects his feelings and frustrations on the POW situation. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Walking K, and I am looking forward to reading more of DeMott's writing."
3,dont be nice,i was just being nice by saying the movie was ok and seeing that i have to make it so long this will be the only one i rate have a nice day
3,"Interesting Methodology, but this Book is Out of Date","Reading through this book, I didn't realize that it was for the 2.0 version of this methodology. Version 3.01 is out now and is dramatically different from 2.0--almost to the point where this book is unusable. However, it did help me understand what Fusebox is all about, which I was able to apply to the 3.0 version.I recommend waiting till the authors update their book to the 3.0 version of fusebox. ..."
2,Look at the free Fusebox docs first...,"First, fusebox is great. I started using it and I am doing more with less code. I have been programming web apps for about 3 years and fusebox is the best methodology for WEB programmming because of its various levels of implementation and open-source approach...now, about the book...I will say I commend the authors/editors for publishing a fusebox book, but I wish they had more time to edit and organize it. It has good content, but is hard to follow because it is not clearly organzied. In addition, some areas stop short of discussing each point involving a method in fusebox. For example, CF_ReuseForm has three different usages, but NONE are THOROUGHLY explained. Save some dough and get the PDF version.I guess the first edition/version of some books turn out better in future editions, and here is hoping that Steve, etal, create a more clear and organized book for version 3 of fusebox."
4,A good start to Fusebox,This book is an expansion of the Fusebox specifications and will get someone up and running with the methodology.
1,Fusebox,"Well if you own the old one like I did and won it at a CF meeting than its ok , but if you had to pay for it , its not worth the paper its written on. The grammatical errors and spelling is enough to return the book, let alone the people that did a half A__ job of completing everything in the book, too many open holes."
3,motivating and encouraging,"I have read the whole content and I find this book as very motivating and courageous. It confirm my principle that to be successful in life, it is not necessary be through material wealth but rather through hard work, perseverance, continuous learning and to stand firm with your own belief."
4,heroes,"Good selection of heroes. Information is fairly interesting, but reading level is high. I am using it with students who need to be motivated, and the vocabulary is difficult for them."
3,Best price on the web but ....,About 10 - 15 diapers in the packet had the following defects:> Either the tabs on one of the side would break within an hour or so.> The whole diaper would break and all the white salt like stuff would come out of the diaper
5,The Best Diapers. Period!,"We have tried almost every diaper on the market from the basic Huggies & other Pampers products to the eco-friendly Tushies and have decided the Swaddlers line in the only diaper for our baby's bottom. They are soft and fit well. Most importantly, they contain leaks and the tape does not scratch baby. Hands down, no other diaper can match these!"
5,Best diapers around,"I found the swaddlers to be the best fit for my 5 month old daughter. I have tried the pampers baby dry and the tabs stick to her body and she has leaked through after a long night's sleep. I find the swaddlers to fit perfect to her body and she does not leak. This price is great. I have shopped around and found these the cheapest. If anyone can find them cheaper, PLEASE let me know."
5,Diapers,"My favorite thing about these diapers is that they're so soft.I also love having diapers delivered right to my door; much more convenient than lugging that big box off the store shelf, into my car, etc. Free shipping is also a plus!"
1,DAB Nutrition is a terrible vendor,"I would highly recommend paying for this product from anyone other than DAB Nutrition. They provide terrible service and refuse to honor their own pricing. They canceled my order and many others for diapers without cause and brushed everyone off when contacted. If it comes down to paying an extra cent to Amazon or any of the other vendors linked through Amazon, use them instead of DAB."
1,Watch for rashes,"Both of my children developed itchy red rashes from Pampers diapers. Once I switched them to another brand (Huggies) the rash disappeared. I am not the only person I know of who has had this experience. In talking to other moms, I have heard this same tale a few times. There must be something in the chemicals they use that causes irritation on tender skin. I have never had any problems with Huggies - in fact, other than the rashes my children got from these diapers, they have never had an incident of diaper rash."
4,"Package is poorly labeled, it only contains size ONE diapers",The package says size 1-2 diapers. It really only has size one diapers in it. The diapers are great quality but too small. The diapers are soft and fit good but only if your baby is still in size one.
4,Old stock being sold??,"after a lot of trial and error between Huggies (baby-fit and Supreme) as well as Pampers (Baby dry), i have settled down for swaddlers. I had bought the size 1 of these from Target and was pretty impressed. they were soft and my baby looked very comfy in them. They had a net/mesh kind of finish for the diaper inside and that made it very soft (almost cloth like). But when i got a size 1-2 economy pack i found that they differed a lot in the softness front. These do not have that net/mesh finish. Are these economy packs specially designed for the economical price or are these the earlier versions of the swaddlers being repacked by Pampers and sold???I however, still prefer these to all the other brands i tried and have just ordered another box for my 31/2 month old baby."
5,5 cases down and going...,"We have ordered 5 cases from Amazon so far and they are great. No leaks, easy to put on, and a good price."
5,Another Capitol Records Early 80's Gem!,"Highly Recommeded! Sheree Brown: an excellent singer, songwriter and muscian. If you are looking for some upbeat yet mellow singing, superb music and insrumentation, great musicians (try Patrice Rushen among others) then this is a must have. Since this old school, mellow R&B album wasn'tmarketed as other releases of the same time period, chances are you missed it. This album is up-lifting, spirited, mellow, funky, smooth, all at the same time. Buy it! I waited many seasons for this to be re-issued on CD. Let's hope her first album is re-issued as well. It is just as good as this one. 'And maybe EMI/Capitol will re-issue it's Gene Dunlap catalog as well!"
1,Not worthy of a autobiography.,"I have had little respect for Emery since I've heard and read about how rude he was to Gram Parsons in a interview in the 60's, which carried over to the way Gram Parsons was treated when he performed on The Grand Old Opry. It shows just how narrow and closeminded he could be toward a new talent trying to make it, who didn't meet his criteria. Like he is one to judge talent. Gram Parsons was a great talent, and his music still carries. He really didn't need a nod from Emery, of all people. By the way, Gram's Nubie suit hangs in the Country Music Hall Of Fame after all. He loved county music."
1,a self serving autobiography from a self-serving man,"One only has to read this hodge podge of vignettes from one of the most self-serving, conceited individuals in country music to realize that Skeeter Davis told the truth about him in her autobiography. This man is arrogant and prejudiced in every sense of the words. Hillbilly music put your name of the map Mr. Emery......and the same people you met on your way up are the same ones you will meet on your way down. Shame on you and your bigoted, one sided views!"
1,Piece of Junk,"What a piece of junk. The markers feel dried out when you put the marker to the paper and the color doesn't show up right away so it's almost impossible to color anything with them. The kids can scribble a bit but are so confused by the delay it doesn't even seem like the color is coming from the marker. And, even then, the color is very light, as if the marker is running out of ink already. Plus, the description says that it comes with a pouch for the markers but it doesn't. The markers come in disposable plastic wrap. This is the biggest waste of money. What a disgraceful product. Could have gotten better at the dollar store than this cheap piece of crap."
5,Great for a creative (and messy) child!,"My oldest loves the Color Wonder system. The markers only work on the Color Wonder paper, so he can create his masterpieces without the extra mess, which is good for me.This is a great toy for messy artists and their parents!"
3,"Has it's merits for younger children, but a little disappointing","The color wonder markers seemed like a great ""starter"" marker for my toddler. A marker that only works on special paper? Yes, please! But what I found is that there is a 2-3 second delay in the clear ink changing to the color, that my child got a little annoyed. Also, you can only use one side of the paper, so there was half as much drawing space as I thought there would be (we always, turn it over and keep drawing with normal paper.) My son, who is almost 2, had trouble putting the caps back on the markers, so we'll just have to put these away for a few more months and try again later.I could see this being great for school-age kids, but maybe not so great for toddlers."
5,Crayola Color Wonder,Great for little kids. you dont have to worry about them writting on the walls.
1,tired,Busta is known for bringing His First Jam out as Something catchy but this Track feels like He is only going through the Motions&is very tired.the Video though is Tight.
1,this [is weak],oh yeah busta's doing ... music like everybody else what makes it even worse is that sean paul is on the tired remix why do people make remixes with the same beat but add somewbody else is beyond me?
5,The pinnacle of TMJ,"The pinnacle. The epitome. The peak. Shades of what was possible for TMJ were shown on ""Son of Sam"" and their full color brought about on this, their best album. Enjoy."
1,By far the worse movie I have ever purchased,"OK so I must admit I bought it because of Ms Glori-Anne Gilbert, who is one of my fantasies and the movie was dirt cheap, so how must can I complain?OK to start Ms Gilbert should NOT be in the cover as she has like 3 minutes in the whole movie, besides that the whole movie is just plain awful I knew there where B movies but I would rate this one as a D or lower movie!"
3,B+,Vamps 2: Blood SistersSatanic Yuppies is a good little film from B+ Productions. A good story made better with the new scenes inserts. Check out Vamps and Vamps2.
4,a good introduction,"Excerpt from C# Online.NET Review (wiki.CSharp-Online.NET):""The author is quite well known in parts of the Microsoft realms. He is many times an author, a trainer, a speaker, and a developer. He is a good communicator--writing simply about a wide range of distributed application types, problems, and solutions. Often, he gives us sufficient detail to illustrate the case without resorting to tutorial-style, step-by-step instructions."""
4,noise khanyile,"I think that Noise Khanyile's the Art Of Noise is very suprising. I think that it really takes your breath away. If you do not like or have never heard world/African music then you should listen to this because you will almost never think about not liking it. I think that this album is great.The first time i heard this was on Encarta when i was listining to sound clips in the subtitle ""Music of Africa"". So if you want to hear it to see if you like it go on to the 2000 version of Microsoft Encarta under the subtitle audio and then type in ""Music Of Africa""."
2,"Serviceable, but Just. . .","This nice little mystery is well acted and features a youthful Daniel Craig displaying a charisma that had already outgrown productions like this. There isn't much suspense here, as the viewer has a pretty fair idea from the get-go who the perp is and what classic narrative turns the story will take. However, all hands do well and thoughtfully in their roles. This hasn't got the memorable juice that made long series's out of ""Touching Evil"" or ""Wire in the Blood"" or ""Morse"", but it's a decent way to pass a quiet evening at home."
2,Okay but not great,This was an okay thriller - but pretty predictable. The acting was okay but not what you would expect from Daniel Craig.
2,Waste of good talents,Made for British television -- and poorly made. The concept of the undercover officer is so absurd and so far removed from reality that you simply have to hold your nose to make it to the end. And the last line delivered by the inspector Kearney (Craig) character? Barf!
3,kiss and tell:a thriller,Kiss and Tell is a good thriller with effective performances....Daniel Craig gives an understated role the needed emotional responses as the crime drama spins its web..An enjoyable film.
5,PCE Student Review,"My favorite book is ""A House of Tailors"" by Patricia Reilly Giff. This book is mainly historical fiction. The theme of this book is never give up on any thing. My favorite character is Dina Kirk. Dina is my favorite character because she works hard, never gives up and is very brave. The author's writing style is the kind that brings you in in the beginning and lets out in the end. The book is very exciting and entertaining.I like this book because it tells you about facts that really happened and it is funny. The story is about a girl (Dina) who works hard to have her Uncle give her the respect she wants and treat her like part of the family. I would think that this book is great for everyone over 7 and feels the same way I do. I give this book 2 thumbs up."
2,Great Travel Guitar...for a Year,"Great travel guitar - for a year. I have taken it all over the world and loved playing it. Good sound quality and volume( for a small guitar)Recently (16 months after purchase) the top has separated from the side body panels, requiring significant repair (the guitar has not been dropped or damaged). When contacted Martin said it has a 1 year, NOT 16 month warranty. Hard to think of anything with the Martin name as disposable, but the LXM may not be a guitar for the long haul."
4,"Good, clear reference of types and treatments of melanoma.","When diagnosed with malignant melanoma last year, I needed information FAST. I found this book helpful, especially for understanding the terminology the doctors were using. It was clear and easy to understand, and thorough."
1,Not too bad,"This book was not too bad for a reference regarding Melanoma, however, the information is beginning to become a bit dated."
3,its ok,"Its a clever idea, perhaps a bit overpriced since its just two pieces of plastic and a glass tube in a bubble pack, but the outstanding thing is it was ordered on tuesday and in my hands friday. Seller does a super job shippping, packed securely. East to mount, just two screws and holds a few keys on internal hooks or other small items. The actual postage was less than $2 so he;s making a mice margin on this. Also it really does tell the temperature."
4,Very versatile Toddler music,"Smarter Toddler Daycare NYC plays this CD during naptime and lunchtime and interestingly enough this CD works extremely well for both of those very different activities so it is very versatile. Since Smarter Toddler has a pretty varied music program they have most of the CDs in the ""baby series"" but I like this one the most."
3,Zero 7 - When It Falls,"A bit of a letdown after the gorgeous SIMPLE THINGS. Zero 7's follow-up, WHEN IT FALLS, has the qualities that made the earlier album great: soulful vocals, calm melodies, chilled beats. But it also slips by a little too comfortably, like a warm shadow. Previous vocalists Sia, Sophie Barker and Mozez make reappearances here, and new collaborator Tina Dico brings an easygoing grace to ""Home"" and ""The Space Between."" And while the individual tracks on the album are fine -- there's nothing objectionable here -- they also fail to make a dent. You could pick out individual moments that stand out on SIMPLE THINGS; here, not so much. WHEN IT FALLS doesn't completely fall, but it does stumble."
3,New Wave,Well i was some what disappointed in this LP. I had heard one of the songs from this and decided if i could get 3 songs that were likable it would be worth it to purchase - well one song was All it had worth a hoot.Oh well - not to much of a Bummer.
1,Very disappointing follow up to a masterpiece,"I've been looking forward to this release for over 2 years. Simple Things is one my favourite albums of all time, and I had been expecting Zero 7 to progress and build on that.So I'm sad to report that this album sounds like somebody trying to copy simple things, and doing it badly. No progress and no charm.It's so generic, so utterly devoid of life or passion that I actually took it back to the shop the same day I bought it. This may turn out to be the biggest let down of the year. In much the same way that norah jones has run out of ideas, so too have Zero 7.I can now only pretend it never happened. Or at best pretend it's a simple things b-sides album.Come on Zero 7!, you're better than this!"
3,Really average,I bought this album based on the quality of Simple Things which I loved. This album is not close to the same quality. I've given it two listens just to give it a second chance. It's average. Download some of the tracks before you buy it.
2,Not all that good,"This is one of those bands that you hear one of theirs tunes on the radio or see a video and you can hardly wait to get the CD. Then you find that it's listenable but very superficial and after one or two listenings you feel cheated and it goes into your mass play for boring parties or ""romantic nights."" There's a disconnect between the music and lyrics that bothers me a great deal. I believe that these guys tool around with music and get a good sound then add lyrics, I hate that style of writing. If you're considering buying this CD, buy an Aaron Copland collection too and I promise you that you'll listen to Copland 10x more than this CD."
4,Stuff Your Labels,"I love these people that listen to artists because someone told them "" it's blah blah"" music< insert label. Zero 7 makes fine music. If you want to tag it as ""Trip Hop"" you're not only missing the point, your'e probably not hearing other good music because nobody was able to label it for you. Zero 7 has offered several very good recordings that blend a variety of musical genres to produce a warm enjoyable sound that is so very much needed in this time of underachievers. Yeah, it doesn't rise and fall with dramatic shifts...that's the point! It's meant to keep an even texture. That's what makes it so soothing. The fact that they're talented musicians making beautiful music puts them in a very small category. But I wont label it."
5,Mood music for the lonely at heart,"Wow....what can I say? This group is amazing. They transcend all levels of the consciousness and make you feel sexy and uninhibited while at the same time, provoke your poetic feelings of love and lore. I love ""The Space Between""...it's my favorite song on the album. I listen to it over and over, and I especially love the instrumental ending that makes you think of dinner, a walk thru the park and then making out on the sofa after. Zero 7 broke into my collection and will never leave. I love their music, their ability to make one ponder while simultaneously fall in love. Thanks!"
4,If Simple Things didn't exist... Five stars,"Hands down, Simple Things is one of my favorite CDs. It made me think I could dig this 'genre,' made me realize (trying too many genre suggestions: Thievery Corporation, Nuspirit Helsinki...) I dig Simple Things, and Zero 7.That said, When It Falls plays like B-sides to me--unreleased stuff in the same vein. If you dig Simple Things (buy it first, BUY IT FIRST!), you will like this CD. It's got the same smooth grooves and sultry vocals, but not the same lyrical punch as their first. I like it a lot, but it doesn't achieve the five+ stars I'd give Simple Things."
4,EXCELLENT !!,"The new album isn't much of a departure from the formula the band used with it's debut release,However, this album can certainly stand alone on it's own merits.If you liked ""Simple Things"" you will enjoy this album as well.It's worth buying just for the track "" Look Up"",along with quite a few other standout cuts.If you like tasteful,beautiful music this is a must have in your CD collection.It just gets better and better each time I listen to it."
2,It's just Ok.,"Well, it's kind of boring, actually. I disagree with some of the other reviewers who insist that one should cut Zero 7 some slack for being a ""young"" group. Their first CD, ""Simple Things"", was great. And while I didn't rave about it, I still thought that most tracks on that CD were ""listenable"". Along with almost everyone else, I absolutely LOVED ""Destiny"". It was just a beautiful and haunting song. There is NO such track on ""When It Falls"". I can't remember one song I like on this CD. And it's not because I dislike the album--there's just nothing really remarkable or memorable about it. It's ""nice"" in the sense that nothing on it grates on your nerves; you can pop the CD in your player and have pleasant background music. But nobody is going to stop you in mid-conservation and asks, ""Wow, who IS that?"" I felt a little let-down with this CD."
2,Ripping themselves off,"2 1/2Decidedly average follow-up to a warmly received debut, the easy-listening techno outfit decides to virtually mimic the original's success. I do not necessarily need bands to constantly evolve (although it can be nice) but WIF feels like a blatant retread of ST, minus any edge or soul. The vocal songs are worse (except the smartly sung last track) and some of the chord transitions prove songwriting skills to be severely limited, in that the structures parallel those from before to a tee. Only a few instrumental tracks get to even stretch a bit production-wise, breaking a sterile grip from bland electro-pop."
1,Very disappointed,"I like only one or two tracks on this CD. I had listened to samples of selected tracks before I purchased so I was surprised by my own reaction when I received the CD and started listening to it in its entirety. I don't think I have experienced this before but the more I listen to this CD, the less I like it. Some of the vocalists wander -- smearing notes instead of hitting them clearly. Some are annoying to the ear, while others are just plain boring. I think I'd have liked it better if they'd skipped the vocals entirely."
2,"Don't waste your money... Buy ""Simple Things"" instead.","This album is an utter disappointment. It seems like a B-sides disc that should have been included with Simple Things. Basically, the tunes on this album are...boring! Maybe they've toned down the musical diversity found in their previous material to get more time on the radio Phair-waves..."
1,Poor effort by a copycat band,"Well, I guess since Air have evolved their sound, creating spectacular new and original albums, Zero 7 have fallen behind and don't know what to copy next. The Simple Things album was a complete Air rip-off wannabe album, and now Zero 7 are having trouble finding what to copy. Hey Zero 7- How about coming up with your own material!"
1,pure plagiarists,"How Zero 7 have managed to make a career for themselves by not having one original idea and unashamedly stealing other downtempo bands ideas is beyond me.Being called the ""British Air"" is shameful considering that they would not even exist if it were not for Air, who would they pilfer from? There are many bands out there who do this so much better. This album is just not good enough, Air lite.Hopefully one day Zero 7 will find there own voice but I some how doubt that."
3,"Well produced, but nothing new","There is no doubt that the Zero 7 Boys and their chantuese singers are talented musicians and singers, but they seem to have made the same album again. Instead of evolving, they seem to be running in place. Its chilled out to the point of bieng frozen, so AIRy it floats into the stratosphere. ""Home"" and ""Summersault"" are beautiful though.. could do without the meandering solos though. A well made but uninspiring sophomore effort."
4,Simple Things is very hard to top...,"Maybe everyone is expecting too much...typical ""sophmore"" album syndrome. Anyway, I believe that this one is more of a move away from their original sound which was so damn novel. This one seems less inspired, but it's still a damn good cd. I really like Somersault (#4). Just keep listening to it- it really is for Zero 7 fans, but if you've never heard them before, buy Simple Things. Also check Sia's solo stuff."
3,alright,"I would recomend this CD to a person who has never heard anything from Zero 7. I don't think it was bad, but it was no where near as good as Simple Things. It seamed more from the heart than this album. This one sounds like they worked too hard to make it sound better than Simple Things but just quite couldn't do it. If you never have heard anything from Zero 7 buy this first. If you have already heard Simple Things, don't worry buying this one. You can do without."
4,Hip and Chilled,"Okay, this isn't my review. What follows is a review from Billboard magazine. But I think it accurately reflects my feelings of ""When It Falls"":Many a critic and fan have been anxiously awaiting the release of this album, the follow-up to Zero 7's globally admired ""Simple Things."" With the release of that album in 2001, Zero 7's Henry Binns and Sam Hardaker shared a wonderfully warm electronic soul vision with the world. Thankfully, the British duo did not feel the need to deviate from this winning sound on its sophomore set. Like its predecessor, ""When It Falls"" features the sublime vocal stylings of Sia Furler (news) (""Somersault""), Sophie Barker (""Passing By"") and Mozez (""Warm Sound""). Danish newcomer Tina Dico makes her Zero 7 debut on two tracks: ""The Space Between"" and ""Home."" The latter sounds like a long-lost recording from ""Ladies of the Canyon""-era Joni Mitchell (news). Rich, lush and romantic, ""When It Falls"" is aural nourishment for the soul."
4,Be patient...,"I absolutely loved ""Simple Things"", so when I heard about the new album, I was very excited. I have to admit that initially I was disappointed. I think I listened to half of it and thought I had wasted my money.One day, I decided to listen to it all the way through. And I have to admit that I am now happily addicted. I can't stop listening to this album. Something about these songs just makes you wanna listen over and over. ""Morning Song"", ""Home"", ""Somersault"" and ""In Time"" are my fav tracks.If you bought this album and were disappointed, be patient with it. You'll soon discover a real gem of an album. Good album for chillout fans."
5,Tiffany,"Truly a masterpiece!!!! Listening to this CD makes me no longer compare Zero 7 to Air. The music of Zero 7 has a soul that separates them from other artists. This CD hangs with Simple Things, their debut. I would have to rate them as one of the best groups out there right now!!!"
5,Good stuff...,"I love the voices of those that sing for Zero 7. The music is very harmonious and melodic. It's great to listen to (and yes, good 'mood' music!)"
4,so pretty...,"Better than a Hello Kitty CD player: it's about as small as they come, and it does not skip...not on an airplane or a bus, or in my pocket as I stroll down to buy more CD's. My only complaint is the headphones- unless mine were somehow defective, they weren't very comfortable and didn't sound very good. Even the smallest setting was too big for my head, most music could only be heard at a volume setting between 8 and 10 (max), and I couldn't listen to classical music at all. Once I started using better headphones, though, the performance was great. The ""hold"" feature is also very helpful if you're biking, walking, jogging, etc., as none of the buttons will accidentally go off and your music won't be interrupted. And you can't beat the faux I-Mac styling. A good value."
2,Nice for a while,I have owned this product for about eight months. It worked fine up until a week ago when it all of sudden stopped working. It was work fine but when I turned it back on it was making cracking sounds and then nothing. The cd kept spining but there was no sound.
4,Nice for the price with one misfire,"All in all, I am happy with this purchase. It is nice looking and works well, easy to function. No backlight is no big deal..yet. For the price, there probably isn't much better, and it plays CD-Rs (I can't vouch for CD-RW, I haven't tried). My main hangup is the volume control: it is in a hard to use place, a little difficult to maneuver if you are not holding the player steady with another hand or it is still, thus if its on your desk and you want to reach over and turn the volume up/down, its not as easy as it should be.....Still, I think its a good product for the price."
5,Philips AZ900117 CD Player,This is the greatest CD player I've ever bought. It never skips... I accidentally dropped it from 5 ft. to carpet and nothing happened! Headphones and adapter are a great advantage when they come with the CD player and you don't have to buy seperate. Battery life is outstanding! I love this CD player and would definately recommend it to anyone!!! A+++
