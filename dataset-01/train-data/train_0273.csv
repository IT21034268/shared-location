2,Snore . . .,"I am a big Star-Trek fan but just could not get into this one. My favorite types of science fiction stories deal with time-travel and alternate universes - this novel contains the latter as its main plot device - yet even I found myself becoming lost in the multiple upon multiple Voyagers and Voyager crews.An excellent example of what this novel could have been is Peter David's ""Q-Squared"", a very complex but entertaining, fascinating, and non-confusing Trek story containing multiple time-tracks. Also recommended is ""Dark Mirror"" by Diane Duane, the first Next-Gen encounter with the ""evil"" universe from the original series ""Mirror, Mirror.""After reading David's and Duane's books and seeing the ""Year from Hell"" episodes on TV, I was very disappointed in ""Echoes."" It really doesn't cover any new territory that hasn't been covered before. For hard-core Trekkers only."
1,"Never exact, full of errors","If your single goal is to pass the exam this book will probably do the job. Do not suspect a well writen reference on the subject. In many instances given explanations miss real depth, and many errors and inconsistencies can be found throughout the book.Just as if it was quickly written for selling by numbers without a real concern about contents. Occasionally it seems that some subjects were written to fullfil the exam requirements, however, the author did not have the experience with the subject.The publisher made a smart deal with training centres to use this book as their reference...- Not recommended -A few pages of errata can be found on the publishers website, however, many more are still uncovered."
4,Great Book,"In the past, I have used other study guides to prepare for the MCSE exams. This book was as good as, if not better than most of these books. Most of the material on the test was covered and lots of step by step examples are given. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is due to just a few things that were left out of the book. Use the Transcenders to augment this book and your set."
1,"Extremely inaccurate, not much more than Windows Help","I purchased this book after reading a number of the previous good reviews. However, after completing this book I think it is the most inaccurate computer book I have ever read. I have been supporting and consulting with Windows for almost 10 years, I have my MCSE 4, and I spent so much time re-checking the facts in this book I could have read another one! They can't even get the requirements for Windows 2000 correct: Their requirements listing on Page 5 is totally different than that on Page 77! (This was the first of many problems I found).If you are new to Windows NT/2000, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK, as you won't know enough to separate the inaccuracies from the truth. If you are experienced with Windows NT/2000, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK, as it doesn't provide you any more info than the Windows help."
1,Don't depend on this book,The book presents a comparatively superficial overview of the material on the exam. It has nowhere near the depth required to prepare you for this exam. It is virtually a carbon copy of the server (70-215) book in the series. Do not depend on this book alone to prepare you for the exam.
2,Good for the real world but not the exam,I just got done taking the mcse test and I dont think this book covered much of the material at all. I won't be using these series of books for the upcoming exams. It is a good book if you were just sitting at your desk and not taking a closed book exam. They have good pictures and examples but its to bad they didn't show up on my exam. I would recommend the Microsoft books over this one.
2,Not for Test Candidates,"If your looking at taking and passing the 70-210 test you'regoing to need a lot more than this book. This book reads more like anowners manual. It tells you where things are located but doesn'treally get into the managing of win2k pro in a work environment, andthat's what you're going to be tested on. It may cover 100% of theexam objectives but not to the depth that you need and the authorsshould know that.If you want a book that will introduce you towin2k pro and have a little extra then you may want this book. Butdon't buy into using it as a study guide for an MCPcertification. You'll be throwing your $... for the test out thewindow."
1,Useless,"I had to give this ""thing"" a star to post this review, otherwise I wouldn't have given one at all. Confusing, inaccurate, deceptive (especially the tests which ask questions on stuff they do not cover or questions that reference an obsecure line in the chapter).Pitch this (...) and get something else - anything has to be better than this piece of (...).Same goes for the rest of Syngress stuff. Save your $."
3,"Good book, but....3 stars and half","In general is a good book but it have some errors on some chapters, these errors and important omissions can be harmful for you but you can supplement this with the help of the Windows 2000.Something that definitively should to improve is the selftest at end of each chapter, the questions should be more similar to the real exam, more guided to real scenarios, I think that it is the biggest weakness. It is a good book to begin, but it should be supplemented a little."
3,Too Much; Too Late,"This book borders on satire. There are endless portraits that feel like we've already seen them. The accompanying narrative is such idol-worshiping fauning, that it's almost comical.Where Matisee would have painted over numerous times on the same canvass to wind up with what satisfied him; Picasso instead, does twenty canvassesall seperately, so you can see the changes. Or is it just to have more saleable objects from the same meager portrait. I have many Picasso booksI love; but this is not one of them."
4,"Of very few products on the market, this one's not bad","There are so few Chinese language software products on the market at all that something is better than nothing. That said, this software isn't so bad. It's not really graduated in such a way that you can start as a beginner and advance to higher and higher levels--instead you probably should speak a tiny bit of Chinese already and think of using this software to keep your Chinese up. The videos are cool, and the proununciation playback feature is cool, too."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother with this software. It is a really pathetic package. First of all, it crashes all the time. Obviously, this package isn't supported since there is no patch for the crash on their website. But secondly, there is no uniform strategy to their teaching methods. Basically, this is just an engine that speaks chinese along side pinyin text. And a few games are thrown in to the mix. The speech analyzer which another reviewer commented on is useless. I can say entirely different words than I am supposed to and it still indicates I am speaking correctly.Really, I'm surprised that this package is even on the market. You won't learn Mandarin with it. So it's a waste of time."
2,Does Not Work with Windows 2000,"I have been working on purchasing language software, and have found that the Learn Now series does not work with Windows 2000. I noticed in another comment that they had the same issue. The program itself looked like it would have been pretty good, but I did not get a good opportunity to use it since it locked my system up. I worked with the technical support people at Transparent Language, but they could not figure out why it was happening."
2,not too practical,"i am not impressed with this cd-rom as other ones that i have tried. Subjects chosen for the instruction are not useful. The voices used in the conversation are boring, unlively, and not play-acting enough to be more exciting. Publisher should choose actors or good readers for conversationalists in CD.I don't recommend this CD."
1,The worst $20.00 I've ever spent,"After 2 weeks of trying to find software to download (the disk I received would not download properly), I was finally able to get it installed. Then, I tried to download some photos. Kept getting an error message saying the setup was incorrect and to consult the trouble shooting section of the manual, sadly there was no troubleshooting section sent with my camera. Called VuPoint Solutions, they told me that my OS system should be compatible, but if it is still not downloading I need to either a) return their product to the the seller or b) attach it to a different computer. Now as far a 'tech support' goes, what BS. They didn't even offer any troubleshooting advice. They also said they weren't selling the product anymore. I guess that is a reasonable excuse to not assist me with their faulty products. I will NEVER buy a VuPoint product again and I advise anyone who is looking to purchase one, if anything goes wrong, your on your own."
4,A page turner,"The first book in the Million Dollar Mysteries that you get to see Callie and Tom work so closely together. Clark drives the story along amongst breathtaking scenery, and mounting action. She kept me turing the pages and I finished the story in a short time. The Christianity part wasn't overbearing. I enjoyed being able to see a bit more of Tom, and can't wait to read what the next book will tell of him and Callie.The only flaw with the series is that the story is ""told"" to you. I feel as if I don't get to feel and see as Callie actually does, that she is holding me slightly at bay. For a story written in FP POV, I'd like to have more of my senses involved. But it still is a good read."
4,Romance Blossoms,"Although this novel is the fourth in a series, it can be read and enjoyed by itself; however, the reader might prefer to read the preceding titles as they build on one another.Romance blossoms as Tom and Callie grow closer, but this mystery gains in suspense as pages are turned. The reader does not know for sure just who is the ""bad"" guy.My one caveat is the poor editing. I offer one example of several that made me flinch. ""Then you drive while I go it through again."" (63) Errors like this should simply not be allowed in a published copy.Thank you to FirstWildCard and Karri James at Harvest House Publishers for my copy."
4,New year's concert 2010,"Exelent musical production, not as good selection of the music offered as years before, the conductor Mr Petre seem not to have the energy to conduct because of his age, but the orchestra realy performed great.RAMIRO SANCHEZGUATEMALA"
3,DISSAPOINTED.,"I BOUGHT IT UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS THE SAME CONCERT I WATHCHED ON PBS. THERE WAS NO BALLET SHOWN ON IT. I NEVER BUY ANY MORE OF THIS CONCERTS, UNLESS THEY ARE THE SAME SHOWN ON PBS."
3,"Nice Cuts, But Hardly Worth the Price--Buy the Record","I'll agree with previous poster that the rendition of ""I Can't Help It"" is a tender, yet rhythmic cut. Yet, its hard to justify any song for the current price of $124 for the CD. I had the album and using a simple sound card and some $20 software, ripped to a wave file, and converted it to an mp3 in about an hour."
4,"One very nice recording, but the price is way too steep.","I too am a fan of this Grover Washington jazz recording and would love to have it on compact disc. But the price that they are asking for here is totally steep. I do own this title on vinyl and the song ""I Can't Help It"" is a timeless classic. Once the price comes down to say, a good 50 or 70 bucks, i would consider buying sho nuff then. But hardly now at these prices."
2,Missed The Sky,"Skylarkin' was a disappointing album from Grover Washington, Jr. It features nothing of note except for the slick ""Snake Eyes"". ""Easy Loving You"" might be his worst song. It grates on you with a piercing whistle sound throughout."
3,not that much value,the chain of this product is really thin that you are worried all the time it is possible to be cut off but the butterfly's size is not that much badit is not a good present for your wife or girlfriendremember that
3,Small but nice,Nice piece but is very small. I guess I should have read the dimensions in more detail to pick a better gift.
3,Get what you pay for,My wife picked this out from a picture online. I orderef it to suprise her when she gave birth to out daughter which will be in a week or so!!!!!! However i was the one with the suprise. It was wat smaller than i had anticipated. The chain was so extrrmely fine and delicate. It also came shipped to me in a complicated knot that i need two friends to help me get out. So ill oresent it to my wife on that special day an aee what she says. If its not what she expected ill return itOr at least buy a different chain that wont break when u breathe on it too heavily!!!
5,14 White Gold Butterfly pendant w diamond accent,"When I received this item I was pleasantly surprised at how pretty it was. From reading the other reviews I had pictured it being very tiny, but i found that it is a perfect size, not too big and not too small. It is also very versatile too, you can dress it up with other earrings or make it more of an everyday jewelry piece. I also love how the tiny diamond accents on the part of the butterfly catch the light and give it some extra sparkle! Its a great piece."
4,shiney,"Okay, I bought this as a gift for my sister. It is a lot smaller than I thought by looking at the picture online. It is however still very beautiful. Very shiney. Looks good with just about anything nice you may have on."
2,Picture and product not the same,Looks ok not that shiny did not live up to expectations. If you expect this necklace to be sparking then don't buy.
1,R U Kidding .... Betty JAXNC,"This was a total waste of money, it's a real cheapo like something out of a cracker jack box."
2,Horrible Design,"I only got this case because Amazon gave it away almost for free. I figured, for less than 2 bucks, I might as well get it. It's horrible in looks and design. If it costs more than 2 bucks, don't bother."
3,"Holds my 5500 series Ipaq with expansion pack, but barely.",This case appears sturdy and attractive. It would be a good quality universal case if it would more easily fit an Ipaq with an expansion pack on. I also do not care for the clasp. The price can not be beat at less than a couple of bucks otherwise I would rate it lower. I am using it for my Ipaq 5555. I can barely close the clasp with the expansion pack on. I am using it instead of the provided HP case even though it is difficult to get closed-- Mainly because I can charge it while it is in this case in the car.
2,good quality.,"seems nice.But for some reason it is recomended by amazon as an accesory for my sharp 6000. unfortunately this product is way too small for it, but I did give it away as a gift."
3,Supreme Time Travel,"A wonderful time-travel, romance. Humorous and enchanting. The heroine is thrown back in time while scuba diving off the coast of Bermuda. A wonderful use of legend and the period descriptions of post-civil war Charleston are charming."
5,A GREAT TIME TRAVEL ROMANCE;,"I love this time travel expedition. While scuba diving,Kate Walker aNew Jersey modern day woman is hurl back in time to 1868.She meet Shipping extrepreneur Michael Sheriden.The storyline was good. The hero and heroine had sparks, personaility. and battle of wills.A good read.You did it again Constance ODay Flannery."
5,Engergetic Rock n Roll !,"I loved this new CD, its on fire! Great listening and great variation in sound and style. I would definately recommend this CD. If you enjoy real rock you'll love this!"
1,Please enter a title for your review,"A classic example of the robotic commercial power-pop emo vocals i can't stand. I really disliked their A Writers Reference ep, and this album isn't doing anything to change my mind about the band. This is the only downright bad band drive thru have ever signed. Every riff and melody conforms 100% to templates. They don't even have the 1% of originality or creativity necessary to make a hook that's actually catchy. If you wanted to put in the time and effort I bet you could find places where every riff on this album has already been used in other band's songs. I'm not saying they're ripping anyone off, I'm just saying they're so faceless and generic that it's inevitable. If you're considering buying this album, do yourself a favor and check out Ever We Fall's new album We Are But Human first, maybe you'll find it's more worth your money."
2,morbid angel vs demented are go,im not too crazy about this cd. wouldve been pretty good if they had a standard rock vocalist and not a death metal singer.id prolly recommend this more to a black metal or death metal fan. they could use it as chill out music
3,Toons,The tape was great for two watches and now the videos wheels will not turn. I was looking forward to watching again and again.
3,I want Baby Plucky!,"My friends and I all watched Tiny Toons when we were younger, and we've been on the search for the episodes with Baby Plucky. We can't find them though. Are they out at all? We SO want them on DVD!"
4,Affordable and Functional,This is a decent PC-cam for the price. The pictures can be a little fuzzy but that's nothing a little photoshop editing can't touch up. It's really easy to use and install and very worth the money.
4,not for the faint of heart,"I love a strong cup of coffee, which one surely is. This is probably the strongest cup of coffee I have ever tasted. Wonderful for those who have trouble getting started in the morning. If this one doesn't wake you up, it may be time to make funeral arrangements!!"
5,AMAZON BRINGS THE BEST COFFEE EVERY TIME!,HUNTER GATHERING IS SO PRE-COLUMBIAN ! ! ! Who has time for that?Hop onto Amazon and click a great price WITH hands off deliveryfor the hardest-to-find coffee -- a few clicks and your Keurigone serving coffee maker gives you heaven in a cup -- every time!
2,Not for Northern gardeners!,"Although I enjoyed the book for casual reading, it was very short on both pictures and specific plant care info. The authors seem to enjoy commenting on the plants that they have included but 'Passalong Plants' is not for you if you are looking for technical information. I wanted it to tell me specifically how to divide, the best time to harvest passalong plants and give good drawings/photos of the plants listed. One of the more disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon."
4,Product Taste,"Sesmark's Cheddar-flavored RiceThins crackers are great for snacking. They are low in sodium per serving (i.e., only 95 mg per 17-cracker serving). Moreover, they are a great price at Amazon.com compared to in-store purchase. I've been eating them a long time."
1,Gross! Try before you buy!,"I bought a package to try and it ended up in the garbage. The crackers themselves weren't so bad, but they had a powdery coating like the cheddar flavoring had been sprayed on, and the flavor was very sour, like spoiled milk left in the car. (if you have kids you know what I'm talking about). And not just in a ""sharp cheddar"" kind of way either.The cracker itself was much thicker and more firm than I expeted, so it would probably work for dips, spreads, etc.I recommend Blue Diamond nut chips which taste like their smokey nuts in a can.I am going to give the regular Brown Rice crackers a try, But I do not recommend the cheddar."
2,huge bloc party fan !!,"first off, im all for bloc party ! but this dvd sucks!!! there's only 4 live performances and a long boring documantary ! and that about sums it up. I only hope weekend in the city dvd is alot better."
2,don't waste your money,"I bought this for very little cash and I still felt it was a huge waste of money. It is NOT a documentary in my opinion. It's not even as good as a nice, solid 15 min band interview. It looks like the footage of a 12 year old child trying to make a documentary. The only positive about this DVD is learning that Bloc Party are excellent live!"
2,"Not good, but if you're a BIG fan... maybe its ok","I really like Bloc Party's music and have all their albums, but this is, by far, the worst documentary I've ever watched. I'd say, get it for the live performances if you want, but these aren't even the best (crowd is very unenthusiastic and I'm sure Bloc Party messes up a few times here and there), but I understand this was fairly early on in their career as a band, so its cool. To give you an idea of the documentary, the interviewer on the documentary asks Kele, ""No offense, but I notice you stutter a lot. Was that difficult for you growing up?"" I don't see how he answered that question so calmly. I'd say buy this real cheap if you absolutely have to have it."
4,Great for the price!,"I'm not sure what people expect when they purchase a two child bike trailer for under $100, but I am really happy with this product! Assembly was a piece of cake and it is very easy to fold, unfold, adjust and convert. After reading the reviews about how horrible the straps are I was really prepared for disappointment, but I did not think they were that bad at all. I like that they are a bit tough to get on because that means by three year old can't get them off!! The trailer itself is very attractive and it easily attached to the back of my bike. I took the suggestion of placing a small rubber mat on the floor of the trailer to help prevent wear on the fabric and also provide some extra support. I love the extra storage and my son loves going for rides through town. I would recommend this in a heartbeat and it sure beats the price of gas these days!"
4,Surprisingly works well.,"Used it a few times so far. Easy to install, kids are comfortable inside. My first thought would be that this trailer would be so heavy that my wife would have a hard time pulling it. That was not the case and the hitch to attach it to the back of your bicycle is well designed.Because the arm bar is only attached to one side of the trailer, it does have a tendency to look crooked, especially if configured as a jogger cart.Overall, its a great solid product."
4,A fun family trailer but a little problematic,"We had to order this item twice, the first time it arrived from Amazon it had broken pieces, but that aside we are quite happy they sent us a replacement.The pros:It has great visible features for out and aboutEasy to assembleOur kid has an absolute hoot in itEasy to useAdapts to a groovy walking strollerGood valueThe cons:The seatbelts are a little flimsyYou must put the plastic down while riding or your kid will get dirt in their eyes and it gets pretty hot in there while closed. It would be nice if the sides had mesh screens.The attachment was a real problem. We had to take it to a bike shop and have it reshaped to fit on both of our newer bikes. While it is supposed to be standard it really wasn't.All in all we're happy now that it's all set up and is a lot of fun to ride with but there were quite a few kinks to work out. It really is an exceptional value when you look around though."
3,Blown tubes!,"I bought this trailer for a trip up north. My husband filled the tires at home to the correct psi. Drove it around the driveway and everything worked great. We get to our destination and go to hook it up and the tubes are BLOWN. Actually shredded looking in spots. We were way up north and spent over an hour in the car to find a town big enough that had a store that sold bike supplies. Once both tubes were replaced the trailer worked great. Very easy to put together. I couldn't figure out how to attach it to the bike but that isn't my area. My husband had it attached in less then 2 minutes. The rubber on the original tube was very thin, I'm surprised more haven't blown."
4,Great for the Price,"PROS: Light, easy and very quick to get attached and ready to ride! Easy access to storage area and opening and closing cover.CONS: My only complaint is the restraint system. It feels kid of cheap and looks uncomfortable for the kids riding. Straps need improvement.Overall I am glad about this purchase. Recommended."
4,"Great value, super easy to put together.","We just bought this today, so I can't testify to how it will hold up over time, but so far, it's been VERY easy to put together. There are no tools required and I didn't even have to look at the directions. It's also really easy to convert into stroller mode. We've taken it out on 2 bike rides so far and It's perfect for riding on the neighborhood streets. Would I buy this for a trek up a mountain trail? Nope....but that's not what it's designed for. It's not a Burley and can't be compared to one. If you're looking for an economical way for the whole family to go for an occasional bike ride, then this trailer is perfect for you."
4,You get what you pay for,"We bought this trailer for our 8 month old son. He loves going for rides in it. However, the first time we took it out the wheel fell off. It hasn't done it since. I would make sure it is snapped in really well before taking off. It is pretty light and when you are riding with it attached to your bike, you barely know it is there. As a stroller it isn't the best though, the front is too light and it wants to tip backwards as you push it. It was a little tricky to install the first time, but once it is installed it is very easy to attach to your bike."
5,Works as expected,Purchased this not too long ago for a good price plus free super saver shipping. Very easy to put together. Took my kids out on it today and it works great. I think it is a very good product for the price.
3,Instep,"I liked everything about it except the canvas stitching that secures the fabric to the metal kept coming unstitched and the canvas on the bottom started to get holes in it after just two months. I had to re-sew the canvas and patch up the holes. I did love the wheels, the smoothness of the ride for my children, the size, and that it could break down fairly easily to fit in my car."
2,You Get What You Pay For...,"Sadly, I have to agree with the other poor reviews. My 13 month old hates this thing. The seats are not comfortable for him; no matter how we try to adjust the straps they cut into the neck... and it gets very very hot in there even when biking in the shade. It is not really a smooth ride at all. I am very disappointed in this product."
4,"Dual purpose, Good Quality","Like most parents, reading good reviews always help in making a purpose. Before I order this trailer from Amazon, I bought a bike trailer from Wal-mart. To make short and sweet, I returned within a week; quality sucks, material sucks, was not able to convert to a stroller. Well for $75 and free shipping, I order this from Amazon. Immediately, the fabric of good quality. I didn't have to read the instructions, very easy to put together. You just pop the wheels in and it locks. The black aluminum looks like along with the black wheel. It may not last 3,4 or 5 years, but for $75, it's a great value. My boy love to come along on bike trip!"
4,Excellent Ride for my 2 year old,Very easy to install. I like the smooth ride and the handling. It doesn't bog down the bike. Look out going up hill though; you need strong legs. I highly recommend this product. You can't beat the price.
1,Great if you just have 1 child and strong fingers,"The bike trailer looked nice once assembled. However, as soon as you put two kids in it, they seem to sit on top of each other and barely enough room for the both of them. The seats are not very balanced or flat. It creates a dip in the middle which is fine for 1 child, but with 2 kids this creates a problem since the seat area gives it like a hammock effect. You have to have strong fingers to latch each child in it. I seem to have the most problem unlatching the straps. I thought it was a cheap latch system. They could've put better latches. But for the money, you get what you paid for. I would've invested in a better bike trailer."
3,This is a discontinued item.... Broken piece after only being used with a bike 1 time!,"This was purchased as a gift for my family on April 27th 2010. It was used soley as a stroller for my 3 year old daugher until 3 days ago when I got my bike fixed up to ride. Already the piece that attatched the canopy frame to the bottom frame broke away, and the fabric was wearing/ripping under the feet area before this.I called the 1-800 number, and spoke to a woman who informed me the trailer I purchased was manufactured in 2007, and has been discontinued. I had to push a bit to get them to send new fabric, and it seemed like she didn't believe that this item was just purchased a few months ago.I was able to request the replacement parts, but warned that next time I need to have proof of order on hand (I did when calling this time, but was not asked for the order number from Amazon.com)."
4,So far so good hope it will last...,"It is my first experience with these types of trailers.The frame looks robust, but I don't know how long the material/nylon will last.My considerations for purchasing this trailer were the price, and the option of the trailer to become a trolley that can be taken off road. The maneuver in hard trails is great. The straps and the seats are not comfortable and I needed to place a soft baby mattress inside to easy the ride for my daughter.Three more issues. One is that the flag came broken, and the other the overall packaging for this product was not very protective, the corners were smashed and there were many holes in the cardboard box. I don't think it is a consideration for buying this product or not, but InStep should pay more attention to packaging and protecting this product.The third, issue is the metal bracket attaches the trailer to the bike doesn't fit my bike and now I need to think about a different bracket to have the trailer attached."
5,Very Pleased,I use this product almost daily and am very pleased with the quality. It was very easy to set up out of the box and even easier to attach and detach from my bike now. It folds up small and stores away easily. I have been very pleased with this product and the price was great also. I have a 21 speed and I don't really even notice the trailer behind me. I only have one child but I think two would be easy to pull also. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
4,Decent for the price,"For the most part I like this thing and it does the job. I wanted this model since it converted into a stroller. Only problem is that the huge bar that connects to the bike is required to use it as a stroller and it sticks out quite a ways and can be dangerous to oncoming pedestrians (it looks like a weapon.) Other thing is that the wheels push & click on, they don't latch on, so I had my husband double check to make sure they were secure. On a test run one wheel fell off, luckily there wasn't a kid in it. Despite these quirks, for the most part I like this thing and it serves the purpose. It has storage pockets inside, and some extra storage room in the back, and it doesn't require any tools to put together or convert."
4,InSTEP Quick & EZ Bike Trailer,"Originally we thought we were buying the yellow bike trailer with the big white wheels but did not read the seller's small print so instead recieved this blue bike trailer with the small wheels. We did not return it and have been using it frequently. This trailer is nice and we mostly use it on the streets and have on occasion seen the trailer from our Tandem bike bump into bushes,trees, and fallen off the side of the curb with our child inside (with a helmet of course=) )and the good thing about it is it's sturdy and as other reviews have said stayed up and did not cause harm to our child. The straps themselves are hard to configure and there is not a lot of room to put our child in whe the straps are configure the way they are supposed to be but the fact that she was strapped and safely in for us to use the trailer is the most important factor. Overall, we like this trailer and would recommend it others."
3,"decent, but needs improvments","I put my 1 year old son in here. The 'seat belts' that go over the shoulders are the MOST difficult to unbuckle that I have ever dealt with plus they dig into my sons neck. They are just plastic clips, not the ones you find on strollers or car seats. I've tried loosening them but then they don't work as intended. I also think the seat could be better constructed. I don't know if others out there are any different but the seat is just a tarp thing that has zero support. I suppose if you have a 3 year old in here it's fine but my son doesn't seem to be too comfortable. Also, there is virtually no sun shade. The sun just beams in and roasts the poor thing. You have to fasten a blanket or fabric over the top."
4,Good item but pay 2 bucks more to get different one,"The product was good. Good design and easy to install. But the pictures for this product were misleading as one of the picture showed this trailer as stroller.I should have read the description well before buying it. But there is another product form InStep which turns the trailer into stroller, which we actually ended up getting.This is worth the money and kids really liked it. Easily fits two one samll and one big. Cannot put two big kids in this one because of space issues.Be careful when riding the bike not to step over a protuding rock as the base is not hardshell but a soft polymer (mattie) like material so can hurt the kids and can wear out after some period.Overall a good workout and fun with kids."
3,Compact Storage,"Pros:1. Lightweight2. Affordable (but compare prices carefully)3. Compact (ours hangs on hooks flat against the garage wall)Cons:1. Found it cheaper elsewhere after purchased from Target2. Careless manufacturing (had to drill the pin hole bigger and sand the arm hinge down because they sprayed too much paint on the frame)3. The safely flag pole was cracked when we opened the box4. A lot of sand/gravel gets kicked up into the trailer through the screen. It gets all over our daughter, including in her hair. I worry about it getting in her eyes.5. You have to special order a second coupler kit, they aren't available in stores."
2,cheap but fabric bottom makes wholes.,"on bike riding, my kid put his foot on fabric bottom. it was scratched on the road. finally it makes whole just in 2 days. what a quality is this."
3,Dysfunctional buckles,The price of this bike trailer is amazing so if you are on a tight budget you can make this one work. The quality seems decent overall except for the buckles which are poorly designed and very difficult to unhook especially if you are buckling between the legs of one rider. It will require modification to be functional.
4,Riding Easy,"We just purchased this bike trailer. We haven't had the opportunity to use it as a jogger, but as bike pull behind it has seems easy to use and enjoyable. It folds easy for storing and is easy to attach to your bike quickly. Our daughter seems to really enjoy it. I can't account for how it will wear and hold up after time which is my only real worry about it. The only other thing I am not totally sold on is the buckles and straps. There are several and none of them are super easy to use. Certainly though it was worth the price."
4,Great for the price,"I love this trailer. Like alot of people have said the main issue has been the straps. They are very hard to get undone, so I went and spent $5 and got metal hooks and used metal circles for the connecters. WALA! They are super easy to use now. I have mosly used the trailer in stroller mode and a few times in trailer mode. The handle bar on the stroller is already a little cracked (not sure if it got stuck on something in the car, that is possible). My kids like it alot. I have a 2 1/2 yr old and a 15 mo old."
3,InStep Quick N EZ Bicycle Trailer (Gold/Gray/Black),Item arrived on time. Intallation was snap! Previouse reveiw regarding the seat are spot on. I installed a seat support and it appears my daughter is more comfortable. Pulls easy and she is excited to go for a ride.
5,Excellent product!! we love it !!,This product is excellent and very easy to assemble. We got it for my 2 year old daughter as a Christmas present so we could enjoy bike rides as a family. She loves riding on it!! today was the first day we tried it on rain and I got all wet and my daughter was completely dry.... I totally recommend it!!!
5,Very Easy and Lots of fun!,My wife and I love this product. It was so easy to assemble and our son loves it.
1,Horrible,Do not buy this stroller. This stroller got a hole in it after the third day of using it. It is really made for one child. If you put two children in here they get smushed against each other. It is also hard to strap the children down into the stroller. Don't throw your money away on this junk.
4,It really is Quick N EZ! Great product!,"After buying the 1-2-3 Child Carrier by Fisher Price and being very dissatisfied, we decided to purchase this bike trailer instead. It took less than 15 minutes to install, and we have been very pleased with it so far. It is very sturdy and well-made. The product is made of a nylon fabric that appears to be very durable. It is very easy to pull. My 16 month old daughter seemed to enjoy herself except for the fact that she can't comfortably wear her bicycle helmet in the seat. It pushes her head and neck forward. I am going to try to remedy this problem by placing some towels behind her back which will create a little more space between her and the back of the seat. This will hopefully allow more room for the bulky helmet. Overall, we are very happy with this product!"
3,Great for price ...,"This is a terrific price for a trailer considering what else is out there, as in you pretty much have to take out a loan to buy a Burley, Chariot, or Croozer! However, this should be recommended for the occasional rider or for small children!THe problems with this trailer are: only one kid should sit in here, it IS tight, they DO get squashed together and it's just plain uncomfortable. I have 2 and 4 yr old boys who weigh 32 and 35 pds and it is not comfy for them. Small wheels, somewhat bumpy ride. The flaps are metal buttoned to the trailer. They are virtually impossible to get closed and will have you cursing the thing as soon as you try it. No tint on plastic windows.Still for the price you just can't beat it."
3,Front tire issues,"This was alright, but the front tire was a hard to use, it was almost impossible for using this as a stroller, but if removed it worked great on just the bike."
4,Great Bicycle Trailer,"This trailer is a great value. I waited and watched through half the summer for any of the local department stores to have similar products in stock, but they never had any and the prices they had listed on their shelves were at least $50 higher than the price I found through Amazon. This trailer converts easily to stroller mode and pushes very easily even with both of my 3-year-old and 5-year-old daughters riding inside. When they get to big to ride it, and can ride on their own, I look forward to using it to carry up to 100 pounds of supplies for day trips on our bikes."
3,Bad Tires,"We purchased this product online at Walmart.com. It was a fairly easy setup despite the poor directions. The tube in the second tire blew-up during inflation. We called the customer service number and they told us it was because we used an air compressor to inflate the tire. I used the same compressor, which has an adjustable inflation pressure that is within 2% accuracy, to blow up the other eight bike tubes we have and I haven't had a problem. Instead of arguing with the customer service rep, we purchased two new tubes for $8 ea.Everything else seems to be going well after a week of use."
4,Good Overall,"We bought this to use as a stroller primarily for our 3.5 year old son with autism. We bought it with the hopes that his 5 year old sister would be able to hitch a ride with him now and then. It definitely meets our expectations as far as that goes. The rear tires needed air when we got it. They are fine now.Pros:Folds flat in just a minute or two.Large enough for our very large (41 inches, 42 pounds) 3 year old AND his big sister (42 inches, 36 pounds, 5 years old).Pushes with ease compared to a regular double stroller.Ample storage in rear.Cons:Bottom is basically nylon, with no real support. We may remedy this with plywood underneath; not sure yet.Doesn't fold flat in seconds like a regular stroller, but it's not much of an issue. It is easy to do.No cup holders or snack trays anywhere. There are little nylon pockets inside, though.Bottom line:For the price, it does what we were hoping it would. There is room for improvement, but overall it's a nice stroller!"
4,Great for the money,My 10 month old son loves this trailer. It is very light and was very easy even for me to put together. The only problem we find is that the rear tire of the bike throws up rocks and dirt through the netting. Gets kinda dirty in there!! Otherwise a great buy though.
5,Love It!!!!!,"My daughter is 3 years old now and we still love this trailer. It is still in the same condition as when we bought it. Even though she is heavier now I still do not have a problem handling my bike with her in the trailer. She loves to pack a lunch and take a ride to the park in it. Worth every penny.This trailer is the BEST! My 18 month old daughter loves to ride in it. She loves to throw in a couple of stuffed animals, a book and her sippie cup whenever we go out. We get so many comments on it. Everyone loves it.It was so easy to assemble. I had it done the first time in less than 10 minutes. This was the best purchase we have made so far. I feel safe with her in it since the trailer does not tip over if you happen to fall off the bike."
3,For slow speeds only,"I would suggest purchasing this trailer only if you intend to ride at speeds under 10 miles an hour. I purchased this trailer with the intention of hauling groceries and/or the dog, so I can't comment on the kid-friendly features, but I can say that it is best to keep it slow while riding with this trailer. Great for the dog though."
5,EZ trailer is EASY!,I bought this for my daughter to cart my grandson in when she goes for a bike ride and we were all very happy with it.The trailer also doubles as a stoller. My grandson really seems to enjoy riding in it and he can carry his toys in there along with him.
5,worth every penny,No Room To Dance is filled with infectious melodies and toe tapping beats...Rush right out and grab a copy for yourself!
1,Don't bother with this one!,"Of all the astrology books I've read dealing with finance and the markets (around 15 of them), this is the MOST obtuse of them all. The author gives examples of his own successful ""predictions,"" while ignoring all the failures. It's as if I went to the racetrack and came back telling you about the horses I picked and money I won, describing my amazing deductions for selecting winners, but neglected to tell you about the losers and the fact that I came away with an empty wallet. Through it all the author's inflated opinion of himself is made glaringly obvious, which makes the whole reading experience even more annoying, if possible."
1,THIS IS THE BIGGEST LOAD OF B.S. I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"This book provided no useful information/stratigies what so ever and I have lost over $20,000 from INVESTING BY THE STARS! Please spend your money on a Dr. Seuss book and learn how to make words rhyme!"
1,Misguided superstition that will lose you big money.,"I admit that this book's intriguing title grabbed my interest. Although I do not really subscribe to astrological belief, I read this book out of curiousity.Mr. Weingarten sadly disappoints when one tracks his predictions against the realities of the market.The notion that the astronomical alignment of the planets can affect the performance of financial markets is idiotic. Astroharmonics? Please, you might as well promote Dianetics or the Psychic Hotline as alternative investment methodologies.Adding to the disastrous possibilities of adopting this pseudo-system is the author's gigantic ego. If Mr. Weingarten is as smart as he claims, why isn't he running one of the major investment houses? And if his alleged system works, why haven't we experienced the major disasters his sytem predicted?Don't buy this nonsense"
4,not too hard,"We make a lot of long car trips, and books like this get us through the waiting phase in restaurants and gas stations.This is a good book of mazes for younger (K-4th grade) kids.The best part is that it is an interesting tie-in to geography. We love that."
1,This book is for people who doesn't know anything about pc,"take me 15min to browse thru the bok and I pratically didn't learn anything new. If you are new to PC and want to burn your first CD, you may learn more by just tinkering with the software you already got. This book does not go into any detail on the stucture of the file format, TOC or anything. It touches many topics and then go to the next. Read the help file or manual on your burning software and that's pretty much what this book is about. Here's some examples: HFS (file format): ""short for Hierarchical File System. This is the file system used on the Mac. Although it's being slowly phased out, HFS is still important in the mac world."" What kind of crap is this!? There are a couple of paragraphs on mixed mode disc and then it give tons of reason NOT to use it.On top of all these, this book is outdated, EasyCD and Toast are old versions and it did not really say anything about VCD or DVD, stick with the help files in your burning software!"
4,Big Up Bush Meat!,I was itching to play this album and was not disappointed when I eventually got it on my stereo. The unreal cartooney world of Infinite Livez album Bush Meat is one well worth stepping into.Infinite Livez is a choice uk rapper with imagative original surreal rhymes. Heighlights for me include the tracks Worcstershire Sauce; Adventures of the Lactating Man and Pononee Girl. Forget Goldie Lookin Chain and the monotone drone of the The Streets - get Bush Meat on ya speakers and start chattin.
3,I'd like to add a star..,"and probably should but this isn't in my opinion one of Brace's better books. That having been said he wrote no bad ones!The plot isn't as strong as it could be or as believable as it could be. Also Brace never seemed to get beyond the forties with his contemporary writing. His fifties and sixties books all have a decided forties flavor, this one included. I tend to like his pre-1950 books better as a whole than his later work. I loved ""The World of Carrick's Cove"" and ""The Spire"" was okay but I think his work was stronger in the thirties and forties. Again, all his books are way better than most and I recommend reading anything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction! It was written about him that he never wrote a bad sentence. I heartily agree!"
1,Waste of money,"Save your money.Content- Although this book collects many scriptures, it makes no attempt at demystifying or clarifying them (not to mention English translation from French). Thus, most of the content remains up there in the realms of theoretical vagueness, that is-illegible.Fortunately you can find most of the text on the interwebs! Easily translated into coherent everyday English and well explained.Form- Spacious margins mean smaller text, means savings in printing, means difficult to read. Small ,grey fonts, again, translate into savings in print- very difficult for the reader. Not all pages have numbering. Why is that? Go figure. For example from p.329 to p.337 no numbering and not a single image to try and explain this bad design. This occurs often."
2,It's not that good,"When I bought this software I was thrilled with the comments on this product that I decided to give it a try. However when I installed it, it was so boring that I lost interest in a matter of minutes. The vocabulary drills always take you to the same ten words, even though it says it teaches you 10000. The bonus grammar software included will never teach you any grammar, however I must recognize that it has some good dialogues if you want to practice your listening skills. If you want a more complete software I recommend Learn to Speak German."
1,Good for nothing unless you already speak German,"I bought this for my girlfriend because her mother is German and she always wanted to learn. She found herself literally falling asleep at the computer !!! The speech recognition doesn't work worth a damn !! I could say most anything in English and it would rate me as good ! The whole thing doesn't seem to have any planning associated with it. You just muddle around trying to learn German. I sent it back to Transparent for a refund. Let's see if at least they can get that right. If you are a beginner, STAY AWAY FROM THIS !!! Try Rosetta Stone, it seems more for beginners."
4,"A very good fictional history of early Kansas City, Missouri","""Gully Town"" provides a very good insight into the history of Kansas City from the mid-1800's through the early 1900's through the lives of its main characters. A lot of these fictional characters are based on real people and Mr. Schultz's weaving of historic detail into the story is well done and makes for a learning expericence as well as fun reading. I would recommend ""Gully Town"" to anyone who has a desire to know more of the real history of early Kansas City, Missouri."
4,Better check that partitioning,"Works perfectly well, no complaints. OK, ONE complaint... I bought this to back up my 40GB laptop hard drive. I was using Windows Backup on XP Pro, and everything started just right and went off like a rocket. Pleased as anything I went to bed and let it finish up on its own. In the morning, I checked the Properties on the backup file, and found it's 4GB in size. WTF??So I looked at the partitioning on the drive, and found out it is formatted as FAT32. DOH! I'm in the middle of formatting the thing so it can take a single large file now (NTFS) and expect no further problems after that.Really a good little machine, but formatted by idiots. (Not ME, THEM). :)"
3,Good autobiography about struggles w/ BPD,"The book goes indepth about the trials and tribulations of the author w/ BPD. Although the book doesn't describe what BPD is, I know what it is because I have it myself and wasn't confused while reading the whole book. She described a lot of people she met in the psychiatric hospital, and I grew tired about 3/4's of the book reading about the characteristics of them. She went through a lot of the same things that I went through, so I can relate to her. There were a lot of typos, but considering everything else (she wrote while being on psychotropic medications, etc), I thought she did a very thorough job, detailing every aspect of her life. It's hard not to feel sympathy for a women who's been through hell and back."
4,A book worth reading,I just finished reading this book and I could not put it down. I think it is so important for people to understand that the mentally ill are still human beings and deserve humane treatment. I was sad for what the author had to go through in her journey back to health and for the many years of her life she felt were wasted. I hope to see more stories out there about people who cope with these sorts of problems. It gives hope to those who suffer and to their families who suffer with them. I hope this author continues writing.
1,Do your homework first!,"This author doesn't exactly have a good reputation for delivering on his promises. read the other reviews for his products, (specifically PhotoReading) before you decide to get this.i have not purchased this product but i have purchased natural brilliance and photoreading. both of which were a huge dissapointment. you've been warned."
5,Very good book about reading/learning!,"This book is real good. It's about how to read a book, with more comprehension, and less time.How is this possible? The system works with different ways to take up information. Normally you read in one way, but this system gives your total brain the chance to help you with understanding the book.I read a lot of speed/rapid/smart reading books, but this one is the top!Don't focus to much on the photoreading step, yes it is important, but to much people think they only have to do the photoreading step. No, use the whole system! Then you will notice the good results.(Rapid reading made E-Z is the same book as Photoreading) There is a course about Photoreading, but I used 'only' the book, and have good results!So: get this book!"
3,too small to see,Wonderful text but too much lost in a mini soft book reproduction. too small to see.
3,Barbie Mermaidia,I got the disk 2 days ago it says it's widescreen but it's not but I still like it.Candy
3,Not my favorite,"After having seen most of the other Barbie movies before I saw this one, I was disappointed. I didn't care for the Fungi characters and all of the Mer-fairies and similar characters were just overboard and cheesy. Some of the voices of these characters were annoying.My daughter does seem to like this movie, but not nearly as much as the other Barbie movies. This is one that I wouldn't pay full price for if I were to buy it again."
4,Granddaughter likes it,"Bought this as a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter who is going through her Barbie phase. She likes this movie, but her favorites are Barbie and The Three Musketeers and Barbie A Fashion Fairytale. Since she likes it I like it. 4 stars"
4,Barbie Fairytopia Mermaidia,good movie keeps my granddaughter quite. all the Barbie movies are good. I would get them for my kids.
3,good,"I liked the way our 3 daughters watched this show with interest. It seems we have fun watching movies too often perhaps, but at least it is an easy way to keep them occupied while my spouse and I are busy."
5,Granddaughters' Christmas,here again my Granddaughter was very happy to get this DVD as she wasn't expecting this one and it showed in her smile and hugs.
5,Barbie is the Best!,"My girls have seen EVERY Barbie movie ever made... at least three times each!Barbie is wonderful. It's what Disney animation used to be... fun to watch, exciting and sometimes even suspenseful (depending on the film) without any violence. The stories are well written and thought out.I even enjoy watching them with my girls. They're real entertainment while teaching good values and no sappy, love stuff that I don't want my young ones to see (at this tender age)."
5,Super Fun for the Young!!!!!,"My 4 year old loves this movie actually all the Barbie movies. While I'm not sure that I want her to think she's a fairy princess her whole life, I think that while she's still young she can believe that miracles do happen. Plus it's way better having your daughter believe she's a princess than a really inappropriately dressed and terrible role model like the Bratz! When you think about it, if you take the z off turns into a Brat!"
3,Best Fairytopia; Barbie-worthy,"This movie is by far the best of the Fairytopia branch-off series--and I've seen up through Mariposa. It does have flaws, but I kind of have a special place in my heart for it--the only really remotely lame thing is the Crest of Courage, as mentioned in a previous review. Probably because I'm an animation nerd, I really admire the ""film"" qualities it has; it's the one Fairytopia that really manages to pull music, story, and animation together into a cohesive thing. The acting, the writing, the timing, the shooting, the music--it just fits together so well.And honestly, I thought it was fun to have Elena (Barbie) be her usual awesome self and have Nori grow to be a nicer person. Well-done and kudos to the makers of this movie!P.S. Yay for pink things!"
4,Culture in a Barbie movie? Yes!!!,"One of my students brought this movie for the class to watch on a Friday.The boys groaned, but were soon caught up in the movie. I am the mom of a 17 year old daughter. She is way past playing with her Barbies and Barbie videos. However, what caught my attention was when a little character, Bibble, was floating in the ocean currents and mesmerizing some ""bad guys"" with a rendition of the ""Queen of the Night Aria"" from The Magic Flute. It became a teachable moment about an opera- complete with a video clip of Diana Darmeau... an awesome Queen of the Night!I will rent this movie for my 17year old just because of that one opera song included in the movie. Enjoy!"
5,Watched it 254 times since December 25.,My kids have watched this one over and over and over. Apparently they like it. My five year old loves Barbie and has just about every movie they have. I would hazard a guess to say this is her favorite. :)
4,Great Book!,This is a must read book for those who want to implement Solaris PC Net Link software. And I guess this is the only book available in the market on this topic. I have implemented Solaris PC Net link integrating Windows & Solaris and this book was a great help. And also it gives clear idea of how to manage and tune PC net link network effectively.
1,Book OK shame about the product,"Whilst this book is clear (in that peculiar Sun Blueprint way) the product is far to inflexible and difficult to configure, and doesn't offer the seamless configuration or features as the freeware Samba. For instance you have to do stupid things like make links to the automount locations of directories you want to share and then share the links like they are the location, whereas samba understands automounting and can fire off the necessary rpc that causes the directory to mount for you. Also simple things like just letting people see their own home dir in the smb share and not everyone elses is impossible. I struggled for a week with the product, which at least the book explains well, but in the end gave up and am now happy and content with my bombproof Samba."
5,Awesome buy!,Was a great buy and was in great condition. I am very pleased with my purchase and look forward to future purchases.
1,you get what you pay for,"Look at the 'too good to be true' price and then take my learn-ed advice: don't even think about buying this product. Its gonna disappoint you! Dang, but it does! Boo!"
1,Performance Unsatisfactory,Junk! Don't wast your money... Drains the batteries in a few minutes. There are lots better products out there for your buck...
2,Doesn't last long,This is a very powerful vibrator but the small battery does not last and is expensive to replace.
3,get what you paid.,After tinkering with this one did i get the button to work. as a vibe its powerful and gets the job done but as a functional product it could use more work.
1,Not Satisfied,"HORRIBLE! Plastic on inside MUST stay covering inside or once u put batteries in it wont turn off! DOESNT last LONG! like serious, 4 minutes! runs outta battery power before u even get to enjoy it. i got a 50 pack of batteries thinking i can have it for a long time. went through half the pack so i threw it away! NOT strong at all! 7 speeds but not powerful. can barely feel it! i would have loved to have a working toy! and, didnt come with instructions. had to google how to take out batteries"
2,Tantrica 7-Speed Cutey Vibe Wireless Waterproof Silver Bullet Vibrator,Its pleasurable but Battery dies very fast. Most of the time it wouldnt turn on. 1hen its not acting up ( which is 90% of the time) its decent.
1,Don't buy this!,Don't waste your money on this because it came to me broken and the paint started to flack off. Not worth a dime.
1,Friends say I smell like soap,"Not sure if I got a bad batch, or this is how 360 is meant to smell like, but I was thinking, I smell like soap wearing this. Then a friend commented I smell like soap, so I am going to stop wearing 360. Just looked up the return policy. YOU CAN NOT RETURN FRAGRANCES. I love Amazon, but I think I will stick with going to the mall for trying new fragrances."
4,Decent Scent,"Decent cologne ... Got the Original Perry Ellis 360 as a present, which i liked ... so decided to try out the 360 Black ... Still prefer the Original, but the 360 Black aint bad .."
1,I'm not convinced with the product.,"The delivery's time was very good. But the case has been damaged at the top, and the part where it hold the spray (the metalic part) is very loose. It had no packaging (like plastic or something) to ensure the product is new or original. I never have smelled the 360 Black before, to confirm or deny that the product is original. It's good, but I prefer the 360 simple."
1,Not Good,"Ok here we go. With all the great reviews that the 360 Black had... this stuff is nasty bad, wife could not stand it.Also Beware that the Perry Ellis 360 Black could not be returned for a refund. Or any Cologne from Amazon some thing to do with the content in the cologne and shipping rules when open... Crazy. So I will only buy at a local store for cologne unless you know what you want for sure then order thru Amazon. Good luck for that best smell......"
3,Classic scent,As other reviewers have pointed out this is a classic scent for gentlemen not a sexy scent for young dudes going to a club. After a while it does have that powdery/woman's makeup hint to it. Wouldn't buy it again.
3,STICK TO THE ORIGINAL 360,"I bought this Perry Ellis because of a friend's Recommendation. I love Perry Ellis ( I have 3 of them; Portfolio, Reserve and 360 ""original"")Don't get me wrong, this Perry Ellis is the ok, NOT GREAT THOUGH. Try the Perry Ellis Portfolio, it is far better. The original 360 is also better."
3,Cheap Engineer,"When I purchased this Reciprocating saw I was very pleased that is came with a hard plastic Dewalt case. However to my dismay when it arrived I observed that my case had a bulging tumor cause by the setting switch on the Reciprocating saw. I sent back my first order and asked for a replacement. Amazon graciously sent me a new saw free of charge. Kudos. However, again to my great disappointment my second case came with the same distinctive tumor. I have come to the conclusion that it is the fault of a frugal or inane engineer at Dewalt that refused to make the case a inch wider which would have been sufficient to fix this problem. The saw is a beast and works great so if you can put up with a tumorous case then this is your product."
3,"Burke, like a later Hemingway, cuts corners.","I still buy his books, I still stay up late to finish them, and they still make me miss the South, but damn it, Burke has gotten lazy. His descriptive writing now hides a lack of plot, and he couldn't seem to care less what his characters are doing. Billy Bob Holland, invited to a picnic of fried chicken, finds himself seated on a blanket eating ham sandwiches. Well, Burke may get rich churning out book after book to mindless critical acclaim, but behind my eyes is the sound of ripped wet newspaper."
4,A fine work,"This novel has bite, piercing prose, and a compelling story line. The characters are vividly drawn. And LQ gave me the shivers. My one (minor) complaint is the over-the-top violence (particularly near the end). But in all this is a fine work. Thanks, James Lee. You are a national treasure."
4,Fine writing but the same old wine in a new bottle.,"Cimarron Rose is well-crafted and engaging, but it borrows too heavily from earlier novels. I enjoyed Billy Bob's dialogues with his dead partner (reminiscent of Electric Mist) but grew a bit tired of the decadent rich people theme from Cadillac Jukebox. If I hadn't read all the Robicheaux books I would recommend this book without hesitation, but I'm disappointed that a writer of Burke's stature appears to be using formulas. I don't think originality is too much to ask for."
5,Interesting introduction of a new character,"Burke has set a standard for the genre with the Dave Robicheaux series; a mystery writer who not only engages the reader with twists, mayhem and suspense but whose command of the language puts him in the ranks of the finest authors. Burke writes in the first person, and while the reader doesn't expect Burke's narrators to take it in the neck in the course of the story, be warned that no one else is exempt - he wipes out principal characters who have survived two, three, or even four novels without breaking a sweat. In Cimmaron Rose, he breaks with his traditional setting of the Louisiana bayou and follows the sun west to Texas, where a Texas Ranger turned small-town lawyer tries to unravel a grisly series of homicides, digging through the mulch of history and turning up ugly revelations with every spadeful. The reader won't be disappointed."
5,Nobody does it better than Burke!,"James Lee Burke is perhaps the best writer in his genre working today, and he continues to improve. He combines the ability to craft taut, suspenseful crime thrillers, an eloquent voice, and deep insight into the flaws of human nature. It is our flaws make us human, and our struggles to overcome them that carry the potential for nobility, and Burke's characters strive mightily to get past their own limitations.In Cimmaron Rose, Burke may have crafted his best story to date. The characters are multi-faceted, the dialogue gritty and real, and the sense of place so strong you can smell the hot dust in the air.If you want more than a cardboard-cutout hero who remains untouched by bullets, his own emotion or the suffering of others, bet on Burke."
2,Same story different setting,"If you have never read a Burke novel then you may like this. If you are familiar with the Robicheaux novels, then pass this one up. I like James Lee Burke's novels, but this book is just the same story and same characters with different names and in Texas instead of New Iberia, LA. Billy Bob is just Dave Robicheaux except as a small town lawyer rather than a small town cop. He has a woman partner, has semi-adopted a young ethnic child, talks to a ghost, defends the down-trodden and his father was killed in an oil company accident just like Robicheaux's father. He deals with sketchy characters from his past and has to deal with the ""psychic scars"" of his past as the NY Book Review put it. Sound familiar? If you have read the Robicheaux series then, of course it does. I found myself missing the antics of Clete Purcel. Same idea here: the rich and powerful screw with the down and out. Guess who wins in the end?"
4,A Clear Winner,"I admit I approached the latest James Lee Burke offering with trepidation. Having been burned by Tony Hillerman (Finding Moon), Patricia Cornwell (Hornet's Nest) and Robert Parker (All Our Yesterdays) when a favorite author strayed outside of familiar territory, I was very afraid that Burke had done the same. I am ecstatic to report my fears were unfounded. This is Robicheaux in Texas! Billy Bob Holland brings all the volatility and suspense of Iberia Parish to a small Texas town. The story is thrilling and Holland is a winner. I'm still looking forward to the next Robicheaux entry, but this is one not to be missed"
2,A Rose by any other name -- NOT in this case,"James Lee Burke has quite a following and I'm not quite sure why.First off, the title has nothing to do with this book besides being the name of Billy Bob Holland's granddaddy's significant other. Maybe I missed something, but this book is about saving his estranged son.While Billy Bob's reflection into the past shows insight into his character, the plot is convoluted and found myself at the end wondering how he ever figured out who did it. Of course it's one of those novels where key information is with held until the end but Billy Bob knew it all along.I think I'll pass on the next one."
4,"Great Read, Terrible Ending","Having never read a James Lee Burke novel before, I gobbled up Cimarron Rose, enjoying meeting all the colorful characters, two of whom was Pete and his PI sidekick....couldn't wait to hear what happened to both of them and fully expected him to jump into the relationship he should have developed right from the gitco.I actually threw this book in the garbage (something I have very rarely ever done in my long reading life) after I read the last chapter. The recap of characters he gave us was [disappointing] and never once mentioned either of those two.It was a total let-down but obviously meant that I loved the book all the way to that point and was so emotionally involved with it that it hurt to close the book with so many questions still unanswered."
4,"Greed, lust, drugs, who could ask for more!?","This was my first James Lee Burke novel. I really liked the writing style. Lee is spare with both words and discriptions but yet still creates full characters and a sense of what a small west Texas town is like. The plot has as many twists and turns as a rattlesnake slithering across hot asphalt. I felt though that with these twists and turns, there were too many plot angles left untied. And, I really couldn't understand Holland's infatuation with the cop. But, all in all, I couldn't put it down"
3,Drop the vietnam verbage,I have read quite a few of Burkes books and am getting a bit bored with his reference to vietnam and LQ in all his Billy Bob books. Like the characters though and will continue to read James Lee just ready for another plot line will try Whit Dove next
4,Great Mystery Novel,If you want a good mystery with Texas flavor and a touch of darkness - this is a great read.
2,Not up to Author's Standards,"This is the eighth James Lee Burke book I have read. It may well be the last. Unhappily, Mr. Burke has adopted the ""cookbook"" approach to his novels, and I, for one, don't approve. As long as they sell, though, I suspect that he will continue to use that approach. However, one can always hope.""Cimarron Rose"" has the predictable human monster, hyper-introspective protagonist, stupid lawmen, and Burke's other standard characters. Unlike his earlier Dave Robichaux novels, though, characters in this book are cardboard-cutout in nature. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one.Mr. Burke, do better; you are eminently capable of that!"
4,Cute!,"As a fan, I really enjoy this. I wish it were a bit bigger but for the most part its really nice to have. Al is so cute. :3"
3,"Ok, not like the old ones","I bought this for my kids cos we had them growing up, and loved loking at the 3D pictures. Was a bit disappointed as the slides seem so delicate. But the kids (3, 5, 7) love it- I even took a turn looking at all the pictures."
1,Warning: Fake Widescreen - Not in original aspect ratio.,"For: Queen Bee (1955)Studio: Sony Pictures Home EntertainmentDVD Release Date: December 18, 2001ASIN: B00005RDRPWarning: Fake Widescreen - Not in original aspect ratio.The top and bottom of the original Full Screen Image of 1.33 : 1 has been chopped off and reduced down to 1.85 : 1 in order to make it into a fake Widescreen Version.If you want to see just how much of the image you are missing, you can view the trailer for ""Queen Bee"" in Special Features.5 stars - for this outstanding Femme Fatale Movie.1 star - for butchering the image in this great work of Film Noir."
5,Crawford in kitsch top form,"This must be the most kitschy Joan Crawford movie I've ever seen and one of the most entertaining as well, being sort of the predecessor of the TV soap opera genre, especially the Alexis Carrington (Dynasty) type of character, vixenish, glossy and sexually charged. Joan manipulates everybody in her family to have her own way, all the other players being merely puppets to the star. Nice bit by the great Fay Wray. Oddly enough, this DVD was released first for the zone 4 market (I bought here in Chile in late August), great picture quality in glorious black & white. A must see!!"
2,Not classic Crawford,"What a disappointing film. A dull storyline, and an overacting Crawford to make it pathetic. It's not a classic even though on the box it says 'Columbia Classic'. It's only worth owning if you are trying to get the complete Crawford set. While 'Strait Jacket' was bad too, it is ten times better than this because it has some funny scenes. Queen Bee fails in two ways - weak storyline, and poor acting from everyone."
3,Love It,"This movie is silly. Wooden - wooden - the director is from outer space. Anyway, I love Joan and this is her meat. But everyone looks like they're waiting for someone to call ""cut"". Watch Betsy walking out of the room - looks like she's waiting for someone to call ""pause"".This is all silly wonderful nonsense. I loved it for that."
4,A Good Crime Drama,"This film will arrive with a big picture of Richard Gere on the cover but in reality he has a small part behind the real star of this picture Cliff Gorman. This film like ""The Seven-Ups"" is based on a original story by Sonny Grosso. The two stories are similar and both films are very good. The story is about a group of three cops forming an unlikely union in a ""strike force"" against drug dealers. They are blamed for drugs being smuggled right out of their offices and they have to not only bust the leader of the drug orginzation played by Joe Spinell but find the people responsible for the smuggling. The film is about 74 minutes long and I suspect it was made for TV which makes it a remarkable accomplishment for a made for TV movie. I gave this good French Connection like film only 4 stars because the quality of the DVD isnt terribly good but at the price this is selling used it is well worth the 5 to 7 dollars you will pay."
3,1970s pilot for cop show that never was,"Transfer quality of ECHO BRIDGE (aka Platinum Disc) DVDs is good, although film stock is not always in the best of condition. A bargain price makes these lesser-known public domainers attractive.STRIKE FORCERichard Gere's third film, some two years before his break out performance inLOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR(1977) is this failed pilot for a French Connection-ish TV show. Lead Cliff Gorman is a NYC cop who teams with the Feds to battle a drug ring.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(3.4) Strike Force (TV-1975) - Cliff Gorman/Don Blakely/Richard Gere/Edward Grover/Joe Spinell"
2,Worst for night mode,Bought this camera last year. Okay for day light photos and worst for night mode. I tried different settings but still could not use this camera to take pictures during the night time.
3,Olympus Stylus 810,"This camera got great reviews in Consumer Reports, and I'm sure it's perfect for some, but it's far too slow to get good pictures of active kids. The ""weatherproof"" feature would've been nice, but I exchanged it for something faster."
3,The book is always better....,"I enjoyed this movie, but it was of course lacking when compared to the book. The cinematography is typical of its time but I was hoping for more actual footage being used....but all in all an enjoyable movie."
2,the VHS tape is defective and in places impossible to stabilize or obtaining a stable image,I had big expectations about watching this movie. I am a fan of contemporary history and in one of the history books about WWII this movie was mentioning as describing very well the reality of the confrontentions at sea. This particular VHS movie I purchase totally frustrated me because over 50% of it was defective and u8nable to produce a stable image in the scr5een of my TV.It is only due to my LAZZINESS I did not returned the tape and complain about it. I would certainly appreciate if the vendor send me a replacement tape
2,The Cruel Sea,"This is one of those unfortunate attempts to translate a tremendous book into a two-hour movie. Good try but it didn't work. The Cruel Sea is one of the greatest novels to come out of World War II and a must read for anyone who ever lived on a ship. But the characters are too complex, the war too long and the sea too treacherous to be captured in a short film. They would have been better advised to develop one or two incidents in the novel."
5,Terrific British war drama,"This is a very realistic, semi-documentary account of British convoys in the Atlantic during WW II. We see the men as frightened, lonely, and, above all, dedicated. Jack Hawkins is the captain of the Compass Rose, a ship that gets blown up by a German sub, and from which he and some of his men just barely survive on a raft. He is given another command and we feel most acutely his torment over risking the lives of his men while getting revenge on another German sub. The movie is intelligent and honest, thanks mainly to Eric Ambler's script and top-notch dialogue. Produced in the Ealing Studios and a gem of a movie. Definitely worth a watch."
5,Ping . . . . . . Ping . . . . . . Ping . . . . . . Ping . . . . . . Ping . . . . . .,"The unrelenting echo of the sonar punctuates this understated J. Arthur Rank film with a taut atmosphere of suspense. Novelist Eric Ambler's intelligent script remains faithful to Nicholas Monserrat's novel about the last voyage of HMS Compass Rose and all who sailed on her. The splendid performances of Jack Hawkins as her captain and Donald Sinden as his First Mate bring the novel to life, as do the performances of the entire ensemble cast, which includes Denholm Elliott. One of the best aspects of the Rank organization films of this era is the devotion that went into the delineation of even the minor characters.Some viewers (an example being my son) may shun this picture because it was filmed in black and white. This is a shame, because ""The Cruel Sea"" is so absorbing that such details as lack of color become totally irrelevant. Simply put, ""The Cruel Sea"" is a masterpiece of cinematic art."
4,An Almost Perfect Cast,"I consider, ""The Cruel Sea"" based on the novel by Nicholas Montserrat to be one of the better and more realistic films on the Second World War to be made in post war Britain. It is understaed and mostly well acted. Jack Hawkins fits easily into the part of captain and he is well supported by Donlad Sinden who had not, at that time, become a caricature of hiself with his ridiculous voice. Stanley Baker is excellent as the boorish former car salesman with his cry of, ""Snorkers, good oh!"" referring to the awful tinned sausages and he is counterbalanced beautifully by a young Denholm Elliot who is cuckholded by his theatrical wife. There is a stark realism which brings home the sheer awfulness of the daily risk and drudgery and fear that makes up war."
5,The Real Deal,"I have worn out several copies of this video. You will see other reviewers who find fault with things the movie did or did not portray, but as a historian I can say it captures the essence of serving on a corvette in the North Atlantic better than anything else available(i.e. Corvette K-225 starring Alan Ladd, etc.) I have had the honor of speaking with vets of the Battle of the North Atlantic who viewed this video and to a man they love this movie. I can think of no higher praise than concurrance of the men who were actually there. Field Marshall Erwin Rommel is supposed to have said that ""what is winning the war for the Allies is the two and a half ton truck. I would respectfully disagree with the Field Marshall, for the trucks never would have made it to Europe without the convoys and this is what the movie captures."
1,so disappointed,"This book is simply a collection of well known points like using top down/bottom up methodology, assertion in test process, constrained random test, etc. These points are repeated almost in every chapter and explained without solid example. Everyone who understands the importantance of efficiency & flexibility & resuability & adaptablity in verfication will be disappointed that there is no how-to in the book."
1,Useless and Weak Thesis,"As an avid teacher and student of Mathematics, I was excited by the title of this book. It seemed like it would demonstrate why all humans have an aptitude for Math, and maybe how those who are 'innumerate' could tap into this inborn potential.Unfortunately, this is not at all what the book delivered. It was basically a description of the evolution of the Human brain, specifically with regard to language acquisition.With about 30 pages left in the book, he finally launches into his Thesis, which is that we are natrually good gossips, and that Math, to real Mathematicians, is very much like gossip. Mathematicians know numbers like they are people, and know their properties and relationships deeply.That was it. No clue as to how people who have struggled with Math can use this gossip ability to help them learn and appreciate Math at any level.Really a disappointing book. Don't waste your time, as I did mine."
2,How the Public Can be Conned into Buying Based on a Title,"I feel like a fool. I thought this book would be about how mathematical thinking evolved (silly me). Instead, page after page after page of common-knowledge information that is presented as an attempt to 'set-up' the thesis. I kept reading, and kept thinking: GET TO THE POINT MAN! And then, when he did get to the point, I sighed heavily and thought: is that all?! Is this news?! Is this REALLY what you spent all this time and effort writing?!Take only one college-level evolution course, and watch only one PBS show about evolution or math or monkeys, and then write your own book. Chances are, the book you write will be much more enlightening than this one."
1,"regretted buying it, regretted reading it","The book sounds promising: how the human species evolved to have the ability of doing math. But the book didn't deliver. First, I think the author assumed that his readers are idiots, because the book is full of trivial, elementary facts about math and human evolution. The chapter ""what is this thing called mathematics"" is particularly insulting. Second, the author may have some good points on how humans evolved to have math abilities, but these points would be very hard to find--I didn't find them, they are probably somewhere deep underneath all the irrelevant trivias. In general, the writing is incoherent and the choice of the materials is very poor."
2,For whom this book is not meant,"Dont read this book if you are good in mathematics. Most of the book progresses in a very apologetic tone for 'our' incapability in mathematics, and aims to constantly reassure the reader that its not his fault.Very little new ideas here, which one would not come across in Chomsky and other more serious linguists like Pinker. Nothing here about the gene either, which one would not come across in any moderately decent book such as Dawkins, on genetics.This book is avoidable, ... unless you want someone to tell you not to feel bad about scoring zero in Math"
1,Disappointing,"This book really goes downhill from the title onwards. After reading one of Mr. Devlin's other books (The language of mathematics, which is definitely worthwhile reading), I was hoping for something much better. The cover of the book claims: ""The Maths Gene explains how the human mind came to - and continues to - perform mathematical reasoning."" Unfortunately, the book does no such thing. Instead the book presents a range of mildly amusing facts and only in the final chapters Mr. Devlin tries to prove his hypothesis (and fails). Disappointing disappointing disappointing. Please try one of Mr. Devlin's other books."
3,"Ok, So We All Have a Math Gene, But...","The author presents a carefully crafted theory of how language developed in humans, and links our innate mathematical abilities to this skill with language. Although his position is that everybody has some level of mathematical skill beyond number sense, he never really addresses in detail why some people have an aptitude for math and others don't, other than to mention the mathematician's ability to cope with abstraction.This is the second book by Devlin I've read, and I'm impressed by his boldness in escorting the reader through difficult mental terrain. If you find the topic of language development interesting, and you're willing to exert some mental effort to keep up with his arguments, you'll find this book a thought-provoking read. However if you want to know why high-school algebra gave you such trouble, you'll have to look elsewhere for the answer."
5,Seasonal Flavors,"This is a delightful picture book that describes each of the four seasons as follows: First, we see a page showing Bear Child's house and landscape, then Bear Child is pictured and his clothes named (""This is what Bear Child wears today-rubber boots, overalls, a flannel shirt, and a Windbreaker jacket.""), then a two-page spread showing an overview of what town bears do during that season (e.g., planting seeds, flying a kite), and finally, two pages of close-ups of the bears doing the activities pictured on the previous page. This systematic approach is a great way to compare and contrast the clothes, climate, flora, and activities of the seasons, yet it is never boring or repetitive: Anne Rockwell's pictures switch from wide angle to close up perspectives and this adds an unexpected twist. A very satisfying book with warm, bright, colorful, illustrations, and lots of details to explore."
5,A truly in-depth survey of the reasons for America's involvement,"The ""Road to War: Causes of Conflict"" series from OTTN Publishing features outstanding titles that introduce young readers in grades 4 through 6 to the causes of five American wars over the last two hundred years that saw significant American involvement. This outstanding series includes: Causes Of The American Revolution, Causes Of The Civil War, Causes Of World War I, Causes Of World War II, and Causes Of The Iraq War. Each title presents a truly in-depth survey of the reasons for America's involvement in these conflicts along with an articulate explanation of events and concepts. The fourth grade reading level texts are enhanced with more than 25 color photographs, illustrations, and maps. Although Causes of the American Revolution and Causes of the Civil War are available in paperback, the sturdy library binding of the hard cover edition is recommended for school and library collections."
3,nice perfume-just beware if you send it as gift,"This perfume is very light and pleasant, and the container has an original shape. The perfume is fine--the problem was Amazon this time. We ordered it as a gift for someone, with a nice message, and Amazon totally messed it up and sent it with no message and with the regular invoice. It was really surprising that Amazon would be so incompetent; they apologized and sent a $5 off promotional card, but it did cause a big disappointment. So if you send it as a gift, let's hope they get it right."
1,"Great, but unreliable","This pressure cooker worked great the 6 or 7 times I used it. Don't expect a quick-release like you'd get when putting a pressure cooker under cold running water, though, so subtract a few minutes from the cooking time.Unfortunately, my Russell Hobbs pressure cooker died while I was standing in front of it. All the lights went out and that was it. Search for ""Russell Hobbs pressure cooker review"" and you will find a few other instances of this happening to other people. Hopefully they are isolated instances, because I know of other folks who own this cooker (also listed as Cook's Essentials) and who have had it for some time without incident."
1,upset,"I was so excited about getting my new russell hobbs pressure cooker. I went through two bidding wars on e-bay to purchase this item (none available in my town)and I have used it several times. But like so many of the others in this review I feel cheated out of my money when the digital controls just stopped working with absolutely no warning. I have only had this for 5 months.!!! If I purchase another one I will certainly look for a more reliable manufacturer, who will stand by their products. Or at least provide a list of reliable electronic repair shops who handle these appliances,especially since this item is so expensive in the first place."
3,A very heavy and bulky Pressure Cooker,"The Russell Hobbs electric pressure cooker that I got about 4 months ago, cooks ok so far.I have not used it more than 5 times though. My complaint with it is that it is very bulky and the top is a nuisance to put on. It is also a nuisance to clean as it is very heavy. So if you want a very heavy, expensive pressure cooker that cooks ok , this is the one for you."
2,poor service,I purchased the unit when it was still farberware. I loved it till it died after 2 years of use. Salton told me to forget repair and just 'replace' the unit. I would love to buy another but don't trust the reliability.
4,Love it!,"This is a great pressure cooker. Only drawbacks, and they're minor, are that it's a little heavy and you have to hold down a button for quick steam release. Other than that, I have no complaints. It's the most used appliance in my kitchen."
1,no communication,"NO COMMUNICATION, December 5, 2006Reviewer: Claudia Salinger ""csalinger"" (ohio) - See all my reviewsI received a damaged carton from Salton Co. containing a pressure cooker that cost $174.00. After much communication from Oren-Co. it was returned at Salton's expense to Salton. To date I've had no communication from Salton nor from Oren-Co regarding this return. I'm now out $174.00 plus shipping and I have no pressure cooker, which by the way is selling for a lot less than I paid for it. Amazon said it could take up to a month before I see any results but than I have to have the receipt saying that the package was received by Salton.....which will be hard since it was shipped under their account and I can't get a tracing record. So, basically, I'm screwed....Do business with Salton and Oren-Co at your own risk, that's what Amazon told me.!!!!!!! I'm a retiree on a fixed income and cannot afford to loose this amount of money!!!!!!"
2,Great Product If It Worked,"The concept behind this product is fantastic. I like the idea of freeing up my stove top. I also like the shape of this appliance.However, I used mine three times ONLY and that was it. No Go. There was no power surge or other electrical issue, nothing. The electronic timer and temperture controler just stopped working.I really wished that it had worked. I wanted this. In the end, I sent it back and purchased a stove-top, stainless steel German-manufactured brand that is ideal. When they get the kinks out of the counter-top electronic models, I purchase one in a few years."

2,Didn't Last,"I purchased this product when it was Farberware. It lasted just 2 years,then died. I had no success getting it repaired, nor did Salton offer any solutions other than replacing the unit. Sadly, I do not trust the reliablity of this product, though I did love it when it was working."
1,2nd Machine 2nd Failure,"Bought a brand new Russell Hobbs 8 qt. programmable pressure cooker, made about 6 meals in it when it quit working,it would no longer get hot, build or build up pressure. Thought I must have gotten a defective one so I returned it and bought a new one this one lasted through about eight meals before it quit working same problem as the first one. I will not purchase another one I have learned my lesson regarding Russell Hobbs 8 qt. Programmable Pressure Cookers."
1,Didn't listen to the reviews and now I'm one of the many disappointed and out $$$,"I loved this machine! (past tense) The first use with just water (as recommended) ended up taking some of the black non-stick finish off so William Sonoma replaced it with a new one. Used it for less than two years now with no problems. Cooks a 3 lb roast in less than an hour which is great! BUT - last use, I loaded it up with roast and all the veggies, started it and it went out while it was cooking...(never got up to pressure) JUST dead - no electronics at all! I spent a lot of money on this thing for it not to work!!! Something like this should last for several years. Definitely wouldn't buy this again without an EXTENDED warranty. BEWARE!"

3,There IS a better translation of Horace out there. . .,"David Ferry's translation is simply undeservedly popular and is absolutely NOT the best Horace in English currently in print!I defy anyone to find Ferry's Horace superior to the wonderfully readable translation done recently by Sidney Alexander and published in Princeton University Press's Lockert Library of Poetry in Translation. Richard Howard, translator extraordinaire himself, has written a short Preface for the volume, in which he compares a passage from Alexander's work to other versions of the same passage done by Pound, Michie, and Burton Raffel, and Howard justly judges that Alexander's is the ""far superior text.""Ferry's language is too often simply muddled, the syntax unclear. Do yourself a great favor, buy the Sidney Alexander translation, and you'll be rewarded with a vastly more enjoyable reading experience!"
3,I wanted to like this but . . .,"I wanted to like this translation after all the nice things that D.S. Carne-Ross said about it in the useful and enjoyable ""Horace in English."" But this is a translation that is made more for image-by-image accuracy than for the ear. Often you read Ferry describing the right word rather than saying it. (Phrases like ""too unrestrainedly joyful in good fortune"" read like a dictionary entries.) In the difficult-to-render i.5 he ends up phrasing things like Yoda - ""Hapless are they enamored of that beauty."" Too academic are they who write as this one."
5,Please note that the poorly rated reviews are NOT for this book.,"Amazon has clearly mixed up the reviews for two different translations of Horace! I have read the Kaimowitz translation and have heard a reading of the tranlation; it is lovely. The author attempts to make the English translation have the same feeling and tone as the original Latin and succeeds admirably, according to my friends who know the poems in the original Latin. What I admire is the intimacy between the reader and Horace that the author has managed to create. I feel as if the span of centuries has been bridged and I have entered Horace's world, evesdropping on his conversation. Amazon does an injustice to this edition by muddling the ratings and reviews with a less-liked translation by another author."
2,Unreadable!,"This is another unreadable (and incomprehensible) translation of Horace. Get the David West translation in the World Classics edition. At least, you will be able to understand the poems in that version."
3,"Mostly average, before they really figured it all out.","I searched all over for this cd after I had heard ""Grey and Pink"" and ""If I could do it all again...."", and I was in denial for a while about it being as good. Being released the same year as the first Soft Machine album, I was expecting ""Caravan"" to be an equally creatively explosive affair. However, after time I realized that this was a band that had not yet figured out what they were doing (much like the first two yes albums). I burned a copy before selling the original just for ""Magic Man"" and ""Place of my own"", for me the two shining spots on this disc. I'm not a sound engineer, so I don't get off on the stero and mono versions included on the album. Why listen to mono? Why? ""In the land of Grey and Pink"" and ""If I could do it all over again, I'd do it all over you"" are the only Caravan albums you need, in my opinion. Overall, my score is average at best."
5,A book to remember,"I read this story in seventh grade and I havent forgotten it. That was six years ago. This book is about a girls struggle with drastic change as she deals with the effects of WW2 on her life, family and world. It was a touching suspensful stories that I would recommend to anyone."
5,Wonderful book!,"I read this book several times when I was in junior high. I remember grabbing it becuase of the ballet dancer on the cover. I think I checked it out 3 or 4 times and then bought it for myself. It is a beautifully written, amazing story of a young girl and her struggles and experiences during the time just prior to and after the Nazi occupation. I was so touched by the story that I wrote a letter to the author telling her how much I enjoyed her story. She wrote back with a full-page hand-written letter. Even now, at 35 years old, I still remember this book and the experiences of Emmy."
1,The Worst Book EVER!!! By Mrs.Butterworth...,"(---Just because I am a kid, don't pass on reading this, it could save you some valuable time.---)This is truly the worst book ever. A major part at the beginning just tells about her dancing, then at the end some soilder with no eduction or has any idea wants to marry her, just like that, they have never met before. If this book dosen't suck I don't know what does. It was a total waste of my time and if I could rate this with negative stars I would! I can't believe that someone would actually publish a book with absolutely no plot and a terrible ending, and I mean a bad ending, but I guess an awful book has to have an awful ending . Hopefully you will take my advice and don't even bother reading the back cover, let alone buy it."
4,Won't disappoint a fan,"""Some Kind of Miracle"" was really good. I love IRD and she didn't disappoint me with this book. While Beaches is my all-time favorite..this book takes a close second. I truly enjoyed Sunny."
4,Good Story,This was simply a good story. It was well written and not exciting but not dull. It told a story of Sunny and Dahlia's family and how they deal with schizophrenia in their family. It also gives a view of how others outside of the family react to this illness. It kept you reading because you wanted to know the ending.
3,One of my all time favorites.,"Great movie! The special effects are almost as good as Charles Schneers 1981 production ""Clash of the Titans."" Sometimes the OLD is GOLD."
5,The Incredible Shrinking Women,"This movie was purchased for my twin daughters who watched this it four times in a row, the first day we got it."
3,Not As Advertised,"When I invited a friend to watch this film with me, I was hoping she would get the whole thing. Nope. Scenes were not shown on this DVD version. If Amazon had advertised the DVD as not being the full length feature film, I would not have been as disappointed as I am. Edith Ann is such a memorable part in the movie, yet she was not on the DVD at all.I hope that in the future, if Amazon is selling a DVD of a movie not at its full length, that they will say so in the description. I feel like they should also edit their description of this DVD to explain that as well."
1,Damaged DVD.,"We discovered that this dvd was damaged after we tried to view it. There was a deep scratch on it. We returned it and received a refund without any problem. We appreciated the easy refund policy.We re-ordered this dvd. The dvd appeared to be in good condition. However, when we tried to view it, it had some problems, also. Other dvd's play without any problem so we are assuming that the problem is not with our equipment. We decided not to return this dvd because we didn't feel that it was worth the trouble. We will continue to buy from Amazon."
3,Family fun,Good old family fun video. Miss Tomlin shines in this very silly movie that all will be sure to enjoy!
2,Pieced together footage brings 5 stars down to 2.,"I've always been a huge fan of this movie and can't understand why it has been treated so badly. It has a knockout cast with Charles Grodin and Ned Beatty. This ""restored"" version is pieced together from the tapes television studios received and not from the original film. You can see the size of the grain change throughout the film and the beginning is so bad it's not even VHS quality. Most scenes are VHS quality.The kicker is that Edith Ann has been completely removed from the film. What you will receive here is a butchered version of the film. That said, it's great to be able to see this movie again since I don't have a VCR. I have never had to give a 5 star movie 2 stars and this is the only case I have ever seen where the DVD is actually worse than the VHS tape."
4,"Superb transfer, but no Edith-Ann...","I too was delighted when I discovered that this great film was finally getting a DVD release. Like one other reviewer has stated, it is widescreen, and the quality of the picture and sound is worlds better than any previous home video release. Unfortunately, this release, like all previous ones, does NOT include any of the scenes with Edith-Ann. I was hoping for the complete movie, with ALL scenes intact.Nonetheless, this is still an excellent addition to anyone's library and a brilliant film as well."
2,No Edith Ann.,"Edith Ann has been completely removed from this version of the film. No animal crackers, no hamster lady... no reason to watch the movie. Lame."
1,Please Release Uncut Version!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great Lily Tomlin film, and they butchered it to the worst.They need to add Edith character back, and make sure the film is not cut.This film needs another release, uncut fan edition release in high quality in widescreen.I stop supporting, buying films when companys censor or change things etc..Enough is Enough..release a great uncut version!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Beautiful dish,"This is a beautiful dish, shipped in a nice gift box and in a very timely manner. made a great Christmas gift I could not find anywhere else."
3,Another learn PL/SQL book,"This book is good, but is not quite what I had expected. I was looking for a book on how to use PL/SQL to build tools and monitor my database. Instead this is another book on learning to write PL/SQL code. I guess you have to learn to write the code in order to build any tools, but the book just leaves off with learning the basics of writing the code."
2,Not very good in cutting small steel cables.,"Tried cutting an 1/8"" steel wire/cable, but the head was damaged a little. But that's what you get for $10."
1,Little red book with little information,Don't wait much from this book. Very little information lots of tables. No help for a profitable betting system
4,Ride the Rails and Find More Than Just Work,This book starts off at a bit slow but once the case begins it is a non stop fast paced quality read until the end. The basic plot of this novel is a private detective on the poverty line who has just got his suspended licence back is approached by a woman to find her father Charles Bradford. She has a clipping from a newspaper story with a photo of him living as a hobo amongst other homeless men who travel the freight trains for work. The case seems pretty simple but once at the train yards it becomes apparent that violence and murder may make finding Charles a lot harder and that secrets from the past will put a whole new spin on things.This is an excellent short fast and simple read. I highly recommend it.
5,Great guide!,"I spent the summer interning in Geneva, and used this guide to help me figure out where to travel on the weekends throughout the entire country. I would have enjoyed to have a bit more information on hikes, but I think there is a separate book with detailed hike info. This was a great basic guide to give helpful background info on the country and specific places!"
3,"Helpful for Hotels, Restaurants, and Planning","We used this reference to cross check web advice and other resources. Helpful in selecting where we'd go (Lucerne, Murren, Zermatt, Lusanne) and where not to go. Specialty section on walking was useful for deciding which ones to do, other sections like Jungfrau's Extreme Sports could have been expanded given how much there is to do in the region. For saving money we ""discovered"" the CO-OP markets that are everywhere. This can be the only resonable way to sample the great Swiss wine and to lower many meal costs. That would have been good to know as a tip early in our trip. Missing key tips like that made this book less useful on-the-go.Wanting to keep it light, we left the book behind in favor of another guide as we ventured out each day. My suggestion is to use it as a planning guide and have another to use to guide you through."
1,Doesn't give Switerzerland its Right,"I had used Lonely Planet for other locations trips, the guide to Switzerland is not detailed at all, least helpful, not so ""guiding""...and seems to want to cover the many parts of the country leaving out the important details of any/each city or countryside attraction"
2,simplistic and poorly written - take another guide,"I am spending my summer in Switzerland and decided to take a trusted Lonely Planet Guide with me. What a disappointment! The book is poorly written, has very few good tips on things to do and places to visit and, in my view, is completely useless for out of the way places; my list of complaints can go on and on. I no longer take the book on weekend trips as it is simply easier to ask the locals.Although I usually like Lonely Planet guides, this one should never be published again."
1,Short guide with little information,"I am often in Switzerland for business and leisure and I wanted a comprehensive guide to this beautiful Country rich of hystory and nature. Lonely Plantet are known to be good guides but this one proved a poor choise. It is far too short and so the information provided is little. It covers briefly the main cities and it just mention the small villages. If you want to discover the most hidden spots of Switzerland, this guide will be useless. The little information gives is generally accurate but a few inaccuracies may be found here and there. It would need an update and consistent increase of information to be considered a valid one."
3,Pay attention to the size,"This cup is marked for up to one cup of ingredients, but it will actually hold up to 1 1/2 cups. I bought it to use when I chop up cooking things, i.e., onions, celery, etc., early and want to store them for later use. The lid fits snugly. As an added bonus, the lid mostly fits my older 2 cup Pyrex, but the fit is looser. You cannot go too wrong buying this item on the 4 for 3 promotion with super saver shipping."
3,Does the job,It's about time someone figured out how to label a measuring cup so that you didin't have to raise the cup or lower yourself to get the eye level measurement. This is a sturdy cup. Mine has taken multiple trips through the diswasher and the markings remain in tact.I've used the lids on my cups twice. I tend to use pastic wrap instead.
2,Does not seal & won't fit other pyrex cups,"I use this cup for making salad dressing. I make enough for a couple of nights and like to put the rest in the refrig. I had been covering my cup with saran, so I jumped at this cup with lid. Problem is, it does not seal. There is a big gap between the spout and the lid. So, the dressing dries out or the dressing (if garlic/onion/shallot) smell permeates through the refrig. It does not seal so liquids will leak out of the spout. It would be good for pouring off liquids from, say, micro'd veggies.The other irritating thing is, I have 2 other PYREX 2-cup measuring cups (I bought this 3rd cup bec of the lid), and the lid doesn't fit them."
5,Righteous Al,"Al Green doesn't just sing a song, he inhabits it. He can be pleading like in the title track or in the brilliant ""You Ought To Be With Me"" or forceful as in ""Here I Am"" & ""Stand Up"". Being from the south, he wasn't just influenced by gospel, but country music as well. His interpretations of the country standards ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" and ""Funny How Time Slips Away"" are soulful and show his incredible range. The creme-de-la-creme of the album is the closing track ""Jesus Is Waiting"". Mr. Green is an ordained minister and part of what makes his music so interesting is his devotion to both God & sex. ""Jesus Is Waiting"" is a dirge that is sung with all the sexual urgency of any of his great love songs and is just an amazing song. You can't go wrong with any of Al Green's early to mid 70's albums, but if you had to choose one, Call Me should be your first choice."
1,Not packaged in a regular cd case.,The package it came in was not a regular cd case. I like a case because it is more solid than a paper case. It doesnt have as many good songs on it as i thought it did.
5,A Great Album!,"This is an amazing album, the pinnacle of Al Green's career. Al's beautiful and haunting rendition of Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" still gives me chills, as does the equally wonderful ""Your Love is Like the Morning Sun"". ""Jesus Is Waiting"", the final number, gives a hint into his future direction. I highly recommend this work."
4,A flawed but beautiful book,"This is not technically May's best work, but it may be one of his most powerful. He writes of beauty as ""ultimate concern"" to use Tillich's term, and tells of how his own discovery--or really, rediscovery--of beauty literally saved his life from the devouring jaws of depression. This is the most personally revealing of May's many books, including some of his perceptive sketches and watercolors. Despite the somewhat fragmented, discontinuous quality of the chapters, this book is fascinating and its effect on me was profound: shortly after finishing it, I found myself more highly attuned to and appreciative of the beauty all around us everyday, sustaining beauty we tend to lose sight of in our busy lives. Thank you, Rollo May, for the priceless reminder."
4,Very Nice DVD Picture Quality,"This film received a full restoration and that's always a good sign. The picture quality Is very good and so Is the sound as well. As Noted, there Is no menu so this release waste's no time getting straight to the point, and that Is fine with me. Another quality Classic DVD."
5,This film needs to be more accessible,Here Comes Mr Jordan is an exquisitly feel good film. With great acting and an wonderful storey. In this day and age where VHS is disappearing faster than artic ice it surely cannot be beyond somebodies wit to produce it on DVD and make this and other of its ilk more accessible. I personally do not have a video recorder anymore but love films like this and would buy them in DVD format. So come on somebody Mr Jordan is Waiting.
5,Beautiful music by a beautiful man,I have been an Al Green fan for a few years now and this one of my favorite albums of all time. When you hear this album you will understand why the music of Al Green is so beautiful. Each song is over flowing with such passion and tenderness. It is obvious why he was the winner of the Tokyo music festival. This album is a definite must for anyone that remotly considers themself an Al Green fan.
3,"Good Album, but not the one I was looking for.","This album was very good, but I was looking for an Al Green album that have very long versions of ""How do you mend a broken heart"" & ""For the good times"" on it. Can anyone help me find that album."
1,doesn't get hot enough to fry!,"This fryer is supposed to internally regulate itself to keep within 10 degrees of the desired temp... what a crock! I had it up to the highest temp (375), and it fried foods terribly, so I got out my candy thermometer: the highest temp it got to (and this was measured in the so-called ""hot zone"") was 350, and it was more often than not in the 325 range. Use a candy thermometer in a high-sided pot. This product was a terrible disappointment."
3,Missing insert card.,"The cartoons are great, as well as special features. Yet, the insert card was missing from my copy. I also purchased Volume one so I'm not missing too much, (as far as I know.) Missing the card was a little irritating,"
2,Save your money,Bought this expecting a DVD of the classic comi-color cartoons.Almost the entire thing was Flip the Frog cartoons. Black and white. Not bad but not what I hoped it would be. Disappointing.
3,Forgotten Cartoons,We gave this to our 46 year old son for Christmas per his request.He has a collection of old cartoons and other slap stick DVD's. I'm sure he'll receive hours of enjoyment from this collection.
3,"Spring clip, universal type",Item appears to be a bit flimsy at first glance out of the box but ok for intended use. Universal fit for most applications.
4,Want to read the next,"'Wife by Arrangement' is the first book I have read by Lucy Gordon and will not be that last. Our Heroine Heather is a strong woman who is filled with honor and loyalty. Our Hero Renato is a typical wounded mail who has decided to never fall in love again. So he does the next best thing he pushes his brother, whom heather is dating into marrying her.Disaster strikes when Heather is left at the alter.Heather and Renato have to get past many of twist before they can find their love and none of the twists are bigger then Heather's huge anger.I am anxious to read the sequel to this book 'Husband by Necessity' also by LGI would definitely give this book a try, its well worth your time."
2,Good for supplimental use only!,"If you are a beginning student, this program can be used as a suppliment to other learning tools. This program will not teach you Japanese by itself! The good points are the video/dialog sections and the word record/playback feature (which I use alot to practice pronunciation). A major drawback is the lack of a good lookup tool to find a specific word in context within a sentence. You are also limited to the words used in each lesson for the interactive practice sections. If you are just curious, this is an affordable way to explore the Japanese language, but if you are a serious student you might consider ""Power Japanese"" (which I think is changing names to ""Complete Japanese""). Konnichi wa!"
1,Do not buy this product!,"This was the first program I installed on a new computer. After 5 minutes of running the program I got an error message and the program shut down. After trying repeatedly to fix the error, I contacted the tech dept and they sent me SIX page e-mail with over 40 steps in the instructions to fix the program. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! As the other reviews noted, it's not really for beginners, you should have a basic knowledge of the Japanese language."
1,Terrible Program - There has to be something better,"I bought this CD before my husband and I got stationed in Japan, and thought it would help me to get a little bit of a grasp on the language. It is terrible. I want to be able to learn the language step by step, starting basic and working to intermediate, like you do with any language, but this is impossible. It throws you into the language somewhere in the middle and you have to have a handle on the language before you even begin to work with this program. It advertises that it is great for the beginner, but I think I just wasted my money."
3,Good if you speak some Japanese already,"I think this is pretty cool software as long as you've studiedJapanese some before. Otherwise it's a bit too hard. I used it and mypartner used it--I've had some Japanese in school and he hasn't. It was hard for him to figure out, but for me it was a terrific review. On the other hand, it was fun to help him out with it, too. My only complaint is that the hiragana and katakana practice is sort of superficial."
4,Picture Perfect,"The book came fast and almost perfect. The first couple of pages were out of the binding, other than that it was just fine."
3,The book that will not end,"I loved the first half or 2/3 of this book but then it seemed as if it would never end. The same scenario over and over. Too bad, as it was off to such a good start."
2,Dissapointed,"I have read all but 2 of Picoult's books, all of which I have enjoyed immensely. Picture Perfect, however, in my opinion, was the least enjoyable. I felt that the plot was dull and Picoult lacked the twists and turns she usually employs. I also felt that it was very unrealistic in many ways. Just my opinion. All in all, an ok book, and I love all of her others."
3,Not her best work,"As with many of the other reviewers, I have read numerous books by this author and have enjoyed them all. However, with this one, I was forcing myself to keep reading in hopes that I would 'get hooked' but that didn't happen until the end of the book when I wanted to see what she finally decided to do. I understand the title of the book and what the point she was making but it just didn't get me interested or wanting more. Glad to have read it and glad I'm done with it."
3,CHRISSY,"As usual, an enjoyable read. Not her best (sister's keeper/19mins etc) but good enough!If you like JP, you'lllike this."
4,Picture Perfect,This is only the second book by Jody Picoult that I've read butI've already purchased another of her books. She is a riveting writer and Amazon probably knows that after you read the first one the second is on its way. I am hooked. She is an amazing writer. Picture Perfect is totally different from her book about the Amish but equally grabbing from page one.
1,Should Be Listed As A Romance Novel,"Terribly disappointing. I am a Jodi Picoult fan, but this was a waste of time. I am chalking it up to the fact that it is one of her early works. It reads like a romance novel - nothing more."
3,Fairly Disappointed with First Picoult Read,"I guess I had high expectations for this book, having heard great things about the author. Maybe she's improved since this book was written back in the 90s. I didn't care for any of the characters, didn't care for the flashbacks, and simply skimmed through the final third of the book just to see what happened.Overall, I wish I hadn't wasted the hours on it."
3,Not Up To Her Usual Standards,"This is not the Jody Picoult I love to read. I'm not sure what happened here, but this book is mediocre. I am used to her tackling controversial issues with more depth and understanding than this book. While it is evident that she did a lot of research into the American Indian culture, it was an aside to this book, I felt. I am used to very high standards from Jody Picoult, and this one just didn't do it for me."
4,...,"Not the usual Jodi Picoult ending, was waiting for the drastic turn in events and am sad it never game. Great story, amazing author- highly recommended."
3,Review,"A very good read, with a poor ending. I was left disappointed by it and wished there was more to read."
4,Good read,Who doesn't love Jodi Picoult? She must research continually. Her books all have different subject matter but it's as if she becomes an expert on each subject. This book wasn't my favorite book but I still enjoyed it. All of her books are interesting and hard to put down.
3,picture perfect,I liked this book but I liked other books by Jodie Picoult better. I felt this predictable as far as the outcome. Her other books have more of a surprise ending.
1,Word cannot describe how much I hated this book!,"Domestic violence is a very serious issue and being on the outside looking in is such a painful and frustrating place to be. That being said, if you want to spend many hours being frustrated and annoyed by completely unlikable characters then this is the book for you. I really wanted to like this book. It was a very quick read and after each chapter I just kept hoping that Piccoult could find some way to reel me in and make me a fan. Sadly this does not happen. It feels as though the book has trouble stringing the characters together or even giving reasons for their existance. There is no payoff for any character, just misery all around. As the book ends, you are supposed to feel proud of Cassie's strength, but you really just continue to feel weakness and pity. It was just too bad."
3,Perfect Snooze,"This story had a beginning that had a lot of potential. A woman is found with a cut on her head, wandering around a cemetary and church. The mystery is set as to what happened to this woman? But the amnesia didn't last long, and soon Cassie remembers everything that happened that lead to her loss of memory. Three years prior Cassie married Hollywood star Alex Rivers. Life was just wonderful except for those wee moments when Alex would beat her. And so the tale that leads Cassie to eventually leave her abusive marriage, but only after doing what every other battered woman does: keeps going back hoping he'd change, getting into therepy, having a baby.I was glad to see that this novel did not involve a court case, as all the other novels by Picoult did. And the author also portrayed domestic violence quite accurately. But for some reason, I was not immediately pulled in, and felt I could predict the next turn."
2,so so,"I honestly just never got really captured by this one. The writing was beautiful, just nothing that made me put it down and go ""now that was good""."
2,Boring,I am a great fan of Picoult but was very dissappointed with this book. I list The Pact as my favorite book followed by a few of her earlier titles but this book was a total bore. I would have put it down if it was not for the author. I kept thinking this has to get better but it never did. Save your time and skip this one.
3,Picture Perfect,I didn't enjoy Picture Perfect as much as I enjoyed Jodi Picoult's other novels. I couldn't identify with the characters and don't find the subject of domestic abuse interesting. I really enjoyed her other novels.
4,Abuse,"An old problem, no social economic divide, affects us all. Jodi does it again hits the heart and mind."
2,Get to the point please,"I am a huge Picoult fan, and when I bought this book it actually made it's way through three friends before I got to read it myself. I did not like this book at all. It's an important topic, yes, but it's been done, and in not much different stlye then say, Sleeping with the Enemy, minus the killing, add in the Hollywood scene. It was frightfully long, and I just kept thinking, okay Jodi we get the point he's abusive, he's a tortured soul...don't torture me for it. She could have cut about 100 pages from the book, truly. There was a lot of filler, and unimportant events, and then too many beatings....we get the point already.However, I give Picoult credit for her understanding of a situation a lot of women are in, staying with an abuser, blaming themselves. Picoult is a MASTER at building her characters, and while I didn't appreciate the story much, or find it new, or in intriguing, her characters ALWAYS are."
3,Not so perfect!,"I have read every one of Jodi's books except MERCY. I enjoyed all of her books except this one and Songs of the Humpback Whale. Both of these were her earliest novels, and her writing and stories have come a long way over the years.This book is confusing & disappointing. The central character, Cassie, is amnesic, yet she does remember some things. It is never clear how the amnesia occurred or how she comes to recover from it. I felt that there was far too much going on in the story: Hollywood life, Indian Mythology, anthropology and then add to that the domestic violence theme. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers (at least me) lost in the middle."
1,Page 36,"This book has been a waste of my time and money. I made it to page 36 (after two attempts) and that's as far as I'm going to go.I've not read any other books by Picoult; I hear good things all the time. I guess I just picked the wrong one to start with, because Picture Perfect is not enjoyable at all.The writing is both dull and overly dramatic. The whole situation is rather soap opera-esque and unbelievable. Very, very slow.Don't waste your time."
1,Don't even start reading this one...it doesn't get any better,"Read all the other one-star reviews. They say it very well. I trudged through half of this book & skipped to the last two chapters, only mildly curious as to how it would end. No surprise there. They have reissued this book with a picture of a yellow dress with a green field in the background -- similar to cover pictures on her newer books. Don't be fooled. This was copywritten in 1995. Luckily for her fans, and I am one, her later offerings improved immensely."
3,too weak a female character,I am glad this isn't the first book I have read by Ms. Picoult. I really enjoy her latest books but this one is from 1995 and her main character is too weak. I will never understand why a woman would stay with a man who beats her and Cassie does just that. Tries to make Alex feel better. oh please. Who cares if he feels miserable and had an awful childhood? Get over it already. It took her almost 300 pages to find the answer. I don't want to give the whole plot away but that is not love.
2,Hate Author's Style of Writing,"I don't want to say Picoult's books aren't good, but I find the style of writing very frustrating. She goes back and forth and takes forever to get to the point. The books are so long that afterwhile, it's hard to maintain interest. I finally just flipped to the ending and ended it all."
2,Odd Picoult,"By 'odd,' I don't mean Jodi Picoult is odd, she is my favorite leisure reading author for the past 2 or 3 years and I have read almost all of her books. What I mean is that the voice in this book is a voice that is so different than hers that it almost does not seem like one of her books. I am not complaining about her writing in a different voice; I think her flexibility in voice across her books is generally a positive characteristic of her books, in fact. I just found this voice somewhat distant and the story jumbled, like she had a hard time for whatever reason taking the emotional perspective of her characters in this book. However, as I said, I really enjoy most of her books so do not let this negative review detract from reading her books in general!!!"
2,Not up to par with her others,"I struggled with this book. I just could not get into it. I have read Nineteen Min, Handle with Care, The Pact, Salem Falls, My sisters Keeper.... and this was by far the biggest disappointment. Hard to get into for me..."
2,"Mildly Entertaining, Completely Unrealistic","This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next. However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives. A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband? It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research. That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book. I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it. It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure."
2,What a disappointment!,I only gave this two stars because it kept me reading - but ????? This is not like any other Jodi Picoult book I have read. This is a trashy dime-store romance novel. What a letdown from an author who has written some excellent reads. Do not waste your time. Can I get the hours of my life back that I spent reading this trash?
1,her other books are so much better,I have read two other books from picoult that are absolutely astonishing. I went to a book store looking for a book from her that did not land you in court system because I was getting sick of reading about judges and court. Well i chose this book and wish I did not. I've started it about four times and still am getting so bored and putting it down. I'm going to finish it but I hope non of her other books are like this one.
5,Great Emotional Read.,"This book was honestly a hard book to read, but not because it was bad. The book was very well written. And hard to put down a bit. Alex Rivers and Cassie Barrett are a Romeo and Juliet pair. Alex Rivers is the handsome sweetheart of Hollywood he meets Cassie on a movie shoot..and its a whirlwind from there. They seem to be the perfect couple, and all goes well. But..there's a secret..Alex beats Cassie, and she takes it, and as many do blames herself. Picture perfect was a good emotional read, and it goes through many things. You will love some characters and want to throttle others. If you are ok with the emotions of it, I do recommend this one."
5,Top notch writer = Jodi Picoult,"With this book, I will have read all of Ms. Picoult's novels..and haven't been disappointed with any of them."
3,A Jodi Picoult Fan,"I have really enjoyed all of Jodi Picoult's books so far. However, this one didn't keep my interest. It was okay, but not great."
4,Good Summer Read,My husband bought this book for me and I have to say it is not a book I would normally pick up. I also have to say...I loved it! It was a very entertaining story with several plot twists along the way. I enjoyed the writing style and would highly recommend this book for taking on a relaxing trip this summer.
4,Good condition!,I am pleased with the condition of this used book. The book arrived in less than a week and well packaged. I would buy from this vendor again.
3,Good but glorified batterd wife syndrome too much.,"I kept reading because Jodi Picult's writing style keeps me reading. The problem is I felt she sainted the battered wife and her abuser too much. He was so sorry and she was such a saint that she would take his beatings because she knew he didn't mean it. It was her fault anyway, right? Sickening. Battered women don't stay with their husbands becuase they are such saints. They stay because they are terrified. I wish she had made him a bit more of a bastard because thats what any man who beats a woman is. Even in the end she makes her ultimate decision ""For Him"" Please. I gave 3 stars because the story flowed well as all Picult's books do."
5,A Great Read,"I loved this book! I picked this book up to read while on a long train ride. Once I started reading this book I could not stop.I, for the most part, love Jodi Picoult's books and this book was no exception. This book has it all love, drama, angst, and edge of your seat action and suspense. On a personal note my degree is in cultural anthropology and the main character is an anthropologist so maybe I felt a special connection to the main character of the book.For fans of Jodi Picoult's this book is a must read!As a side note this book does contain issues of spousal abuse and domestic violence which for some might be upsetting."
3,It was good but not captivating,Portions of this book were really interesting and then it seemed like it would just fall off. I think the point of the book was there but just not fully delivered. Some of the characters could of been more developed and the storyline between Will and Cassie just never seemed to go anywhere. I have read other novels by this author and did not feel like this was as good even though overall it was interesting.
2,Blah......,"I just didn't care about the characters and it was torture to read! My Sister's Keeper and Nineteen Minutes are so good, I can't believe this was from the same author. So predictable and boring."
5,Loved it!!!!!,"This is the first book I have read By Jodi Picoult, for me it was a great read. It made me want to read more of her books. It was a page turner for me."
3,"Plain Truth was better, but still a wonderful story from Jodi","I have read Jodi Picoult's ""Plain Truth"" and several of her other novels and I thought Picture Perfect was a wonderful story, but I didn't think the writing was a good as the book Plain Truth. There are numerous excellent reviews that detail the story so I won't add more print. However, I thought the story moved along at a brisk pace and overall it was a wonderful story. I'm not losing faith in Jodi; I'll still purchase her next novel, with a view towards that Picture Perfect being a temporary setback in her storytelling abilities."
3,Not Picture Perfect,"After reading Harvesting the Heart and Plain Truth, I was so impressed with Jodi Picoult's writing I wanted to read everything she's written. Picture Perfect was truly disappointing, though. The author describes over and over again the many times in which Cassie Rivers is beaten, kicked, shoved, bruised and knocked out by her husband Alex. After the second beating, I'd had about enough and just wanted to see how Cassie was going to resolve the situation, hopefully by leaving Alex. However, Jodi Picoult takes us through countless more scenes of domestic abuse before she's convinced that we truly fathom (yes, we get the picture) that it's a tough situation to get untangled from. I almost gave up on the book a few times, but kept reading, hoping it might get better somehow. It didn't happen. I'm just left wondering what happened to the wonderful wisdom and insight Jodi had in her other books."
3,Behind closed doors,"No one knows what goes on behind closed doors as Picoult proves in this story. True to form, tackling an examination of a poignant part of life for many women; however, Picoult did not employ some of her best writing skills."
3,Not the author's best,"Very convoluted. Hard to follow at times. Like others have said, there is too much going on, too many subplots and stories that don't relate with the main story. Also, she shows little knowledge of the academic world, which is really bothersome if you are in this world"
1,Lacklustre,"I didn't like this story at all. I didn't like any of the characters. Cassie in particular irritated me. She ad no endearing features for me. The story development was poor. Themes were introduced throughout the book that went nowhere, or had no real relevance or depth. Don't waste your money."
5,awesome.,"I first saw this book in an airport, soon after losing my beautiful black Thoroughbred Mare. The Photos are magnificent, the verses so fitting for most situations.awesome!"
3,I actually thought it was an okay movie,"Sigh, I guess I'm not edgy/cool, because I found ""Valley of the Dolls"" simply to be an engaging, pretty good drama, not the huge make-fun-of-it laughfest all the gay icons and other followers of the movie say it is during the numerous special features. To be sure, there ARE several over-the-top moments- usually involving a character using pills and/or booze or commenting on another character's use of same- but they're just that, moments, not non-stop unintentional hilarity. Okay, the gay icons were right about the wig-in-the-toilet scene... THAT was pretty crazy. Endless special features throughout this two-disc set and an absolutely crystal clear restored print of the film make this DVD a must-see for fans of sixties cinema. And the gorgeous actresses don't hurt, either."
2,Gives mediocrity a bad name,"This film has nothing but one great song (with at least one lousy one) and a pretty good title. None of the performances are memorable. Get ready to see some chick staring at a pill bottle, because that is repeated repeatedly. There is more filler than in a Thanksgiving turkey."
5,valley of the dolls,"I love this movie. The actors, the actresses and of course the music. Its a great movie for a rainy day."
3,Overrated in Shockness,"I only wish this movie was as shocking as all the reviews make it sound. The film critics overexaggerrate when discussing the scenes with the drugs, booze, sex, etc.For fans of sick, sleazy films, I recommend you do not see this film to satisfy your desire for sick, twisted films. This movie is as shocking as something you would see on a daytime soap opera. If it had a rating, it would probably be PG-13.Overall, this was a rather boring film. The scenery definitely could've used some improvement. The only reason I saw it was because of the addition of Sharon Tate in the cast. But evenso, she has shown more talent in her other films besides this one."
1,Horrible disappointment,The movie is a disappointment. I was prepared for bad acting but I was not prepared for the frequent deviations from the storyline in the book. This movie is not representative of the wonderful Jaqueline Susann novel that I enjoyed. In the movie Jennifer loves Tony Polar and Tony Polar does not have the mind of a child and Anne loves her mother. Obviously this was not the case in the book. These things may seem subtle but this is the trend of the entire movie. The characters personalities are different and nothing is improved as a result. I would not recommend buying this movie.
1,AWFUL,"This terrible movie has singing! Bad singing, and lots of it! Overacted, trite, and BORING! All those good reviews, I thought it would be campy and cool, but it's NOT!"
3,"It's Bad - Really Bad, But -","This was the epitome of 60's movies...bright colors, that "" with- it "" music and really bad dialogue. To be fair, it was a bad book and a bad movie, but delicious to see, because it is so bad. it's one thing you know going in...it's horribly scripted and acted, but it's fun and horrific. "" I am not making fun of drug abuse, but in this movie, you have to think...please, OD you strung out, scum bag no talent witch. Don't expect anything more than what reviewers purport this to be and you will be fine..."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy the movie only because Sharon Tate is in it (although Parkins and Duke were good as well, being the main characters). The subject matter is interesting, how fame destroys lives, but the way the movie was done was like a cheesy soap opera.Watching this next to the ladies' other works, you can understand why Sharon didn't care much for this movie.I don't like this movie that much because it does not stick to the book at all. I understand books and movies differ from each other but it gets rather confusing with VOTD because characters that were in the book were omitted from the movie and there were things those omitted characters said in the book that were put in another character's mouth in the movie. It's all very confusing.The ending is vastly different in the movie than from the book."
4,camp classic,"As you can tell from the other reviews this is a camp classic and a must see for anyone who enjoys a film that is laughable when it was not intended as a comedy. However, at the risk of giving this film too much credit, I have to say there was a lot of potential for a great film and a serious treatment of ""big"" themes like existential despair. It's just that much of the acting was over the top and the songs - oh my god, the songs are just so funny, you can't take drug abuse, suicide and existential despair seriously when you hear this film's soundtrack."
2,Read the book instead,"Don't waste your time on this movie, it doesn't even hold a slight candle to the book, the moive doesn't give you time to realate to the characters and goes by so fast you don't even realize what's going on. The only good thing that all the actress were good for the roles but they had a poorly written script to work with...if you want to know about Valley of the Dolls read the book ...that lets you relate to the charcters and it's well written and nothing is rushed."
3,Valley of the Dolls DVD,The film was OK. It is not one that I would want to watch several times.I do have a question: What is meant by Special Edition? Is it a shorter version than the original?
5,valley of the dolls,this is a great purchase! i was very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any one interested in buying it.
3,Drugs and the stars?,This movie was an eye opener in its day but we read about this in the tabloids all the time. It got rave reviews from my daughter for the acting because she loves Patty Duke. I saw it when it came out and it isn't nearly as shocking as it was then.
5,It's time for this movie to be released on DVD!,"Great movie - so bad it's good - and ""Sparkle, Neely, sparkle! "" So many great lines and camp scenes and ridiculous songs and...you already know the list. I'd love to see outtakes and additional scenes if any still exist. I most definitely want to see it in letterbox. And soon! Time for this movie to be released on DVD!"
1,Turkey!,"A hilariously dumb and embarassing soundtrack. Dion Warrick's voice just gives me the creeps. It's soundtrack is probably worst than the film (eventhough the film is kind of fun yet trashy). I'm sour Jaquline Susanne wasn't pleased with the effort that John Williams put into the title song (but then again her novel was totally crap as well). The most bizaare thing about this soundtrack is that it was actually nominated for an Acadamy Award, I reckon that it should have earned a Golden Turkey instead."
3,valley of the dolls,i ordered 2 dvds one was in excellent condition the other the inside of the case that holds the dvd in place was broken
3,Valley of the Dolls,"I love this movie. I would just prefer that it be on DVD. The quality of the tape was OK, but it could have been better"
3,Big hit at the time with critics and the public.,"What was a big hit is now a bit trite with age. Sex, drugs and fame were the dirty little secret back when this was made. Now it is cliched."
1,So Bad It's Good,"I have to agree with Reviewer #1, this is one of the worst movies ever made; and yet, like a 30-car pile up on the freeway, it's impossible not to watch. WAY over the top performances by Patty Duke, Susan Hayward, Lee Grant (and just about everyone else), eerie, rare appearance by Sharon Tate, great title song sung by Dionne Warwicke, wild sixties fashions, cheesy dialogue (my favorite: ""There's only one star of a Helen Lawson show and that's ME, Helen Lawson, remember?"") - it's all here. I can't wait to own it on DVD."
5,A great movie classic!,Very daring subject for the time it was made. A movie that can watched and enjoyed many times over. Stunning performances from Patty Duke and the late Sharon Tate. The quinessential movie soap opera with a desperate theme.
3,I Can't Help It,No it's not The Seventh Seal. But how I love the beginning with the snow and the Andre Previn theme song and the beautiful Barbara Parkin. Am I the only straight guy in the world who likes this movie?
5,One of the best campy films EVER!,"This film was panned by the press when it came out in 1967, but it still was a big him.Over the years it's become one of the greatest ""Good Bad Films"" of all time along with ""Mommie Dearest"".What I can never understand is why ""I'll Plant a Tree"" was not awarded Best Song?Oh that picky snobby Academy!"
4,I was brought up with this kind of muzac,"You couldn't do but think of the picture when you listen to this CD. Now this is what a soundtrack is all about. Hence, this wonderful music is what was played when I grew up. Does that make me gay? Nah, but that's besides the point."
1,take pills before watching,"This movie is garbage! Watch if you want w friends to make fun of it. Sharon Tate and Barbara Parkins are smoking hot, The music numbers are as pleasant as a cat screeching. My girlfriend loves this film, thank goodness i date her for other reasons!!"
5,VALLEY OF THE DOLLS scores big,"On this truly classic soundtrack CD you will hear all the tunes that helped makeVALLEY OF THE DOLLS one of themost exciting films to grace the silver screen in the late1960's! Besides the beautifully crafted ""Theme from Valley of the Dolls"" you'll also enjoy the songsthat Patty Duke's characterNEELEY O'HARA croons in the movie such as ""It's Impossible"" and ""Give A Little More"". Patty's own singing career was flyin high during this period of time and for the die hard Duke fan you canalso obtain the UNITED ARTISTLP, ""PATTY DUKE SINGS SONGS FROM VALLEY OF THE DOLLS""--Allin all, if you enjoyed the film ""Valley of the Dolls"" then you will find the soundtrack CD a joy as well!"
5,a 1960s fascination,"I lot of people think this film is a howling joke but in spite of a few lines that could have been changed, I thought it was very dramatic, very well acted, well filmed and very stylized which adds to the fascination. I just love that scene of Barbara Parkins staggering along the shore and then the French erotic film sequence with Sharon Tate, ""Gabrielle, the wine fell in my shoes.""It's a cult classic, so come on studios, video is becoming obsolete now, lets get it out on DVD in widescreen with some extras like AMCs The Making of Valley!"
1,make a good re-make!,"All my life, I've heard so much about Valley of the Dolls but I only recently bought the novel. I finished it in 2 days, couldn't put it down! Even in today's standards, the backstabbing and nasty characters keep your interest very high! I was so excited to rent the movie as the storyline is so wicked. All that's presented is supposedly what some call campy but is really just stupid. 'All About Eve', John Waters movies -now THAT's campy. This Valley of the Dolls has to be the worst adaption of a novel of all time! Please Hollywood - make a remake for the novel's 40th anniversary in 2006. Jude Law can be the hot Brit Lyon Burke, Jennifer Lopez as voluptuous Jennifer, Natalie Portman as Anne Wells? And bring back all the characters in the novel - how about Allen Cooper and Gino? And maybe develop the characters through the years like the novel does. Just follow the story in the novel and everything will be all right! Unlike this crackpot version..."
1,Hollywood as bad as it can get.,"I was dragged kicking and screaming to see this when Valley of the Dolls, a horrid piece of ennui, was new. I'm older now and the only way I'd watch it again is at the point of a gun. Maybe that's what hell is: being forced to watch movies such as Valley of the Dolls throughout eternity.The plot is vapid. The acting is poor and outdated. When it was released the movie was a pot-boiler intended to titillate the sexual extremities. Even that has been bypassed with time.On the other hand, evidently a lot of people love this movie. My man-hater ex-sister-in-law thought it was great, back when it was newly released, though my thoughtful, intelligent, mature ex-wife agreed with me about it. I suspect it qualifies as a 'chick flick' these days. But if you are a person who loves soap opera, who blames others for your problems and wants to reinforce those biases, by all means, do this movie and you'll probably love it."
1,"Run, Sharon, run...","I was only five when DOLLS was first released and thought it was a scary movie...took 33 years after my first complete viewing to realize that my premature assessment wasn't that far off! Kept watching only to see how bad the 3 lead's performances could get, and to keep trying to find a way to reach through my TV set and warn the gorgeous-but-doomed Sharon Tate to stay away from home on the night of August 8, 1969..."
1,THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER!!,"One of my favorite books: I just rented this movie (THANK GOD I didn't waste more money and BUY it!!) and I was soooo disappointed. All the hype - and for what? I don't get why this is being called ""A cult classic""? Maybe for those who need to get a life... (Okay - so it was ""first of it's kind"" with some of the language and a couple of ""scandalous"" scenes). REALLY, REALLY (and I do mean REALLY!!) poor acting/poor songs/singing/ and didn't even follow the true storyline of the book! A sad waste of time!!! I'd give it half a star if it was available!"
3,Woefully Miscast,"Except for the lovely Sharon Tate, who fit the WRITTEN character of the book to a 'T,' the lead actors cast were inappropriate for their characters. For example, it was always stressed in the book that Anne was a cool blond with icy blue eyes: Barbara Parkins was a dark brunette with brown eyes. I love Paul Burke (12 O'Clock High, Daddy'S Gone A-Hunting), but he was not Lyon Burke. Patty Duke was so-so as far as a choice, certainly better than Parkins (Peyton Place, Captains & The Kings). However, as a slice of 60's cinematic Americana, the film is pretty standard and ok."
1,market garden,"please dont waste your money on the special edition,just order the movie alone.everything is slanted from a very gay perspective to the point of being stomach turning.it almost seems to be marketed towards gays in that respect.i did'nt know there was a large gay following of this movie.in the special feature where barbra parkins shares her thoughts with an over the top gay person of some note she is haranged over and over by silly girlish questions and at one point she asks if he would like her to strangle him.it would have been so much better without this flaming gay guy and just barbra.most of the rest of the special features are all nutty gay types offering their opinion on the movie.in short if your straight dont bother with the special edition.its a great 60ish movie that can stand alone without all the gay foolishness."
3,Bland,"These rice crackers were pretty bland. Even for a rice cracker. If you're looking for something with a more pleasing flavor - try the brand sold at Target. (Archer Farms) I will say these did arrive in good condition. Hardly a broken cracker in the lot. The packaging prevented them from arriving as a carton of rice crumbs. Alas, great packaging still didn't make a bland cracker taste better :-("
5,Everyone likes them!!,"I purchased these crackers because I have a wheat allergy and they are delicious. They are not like other rice crackers I had tried. Now everyone in my family prefers them over regular saltines, and I even have to order them for my mother in law!!! They are crispy, tasty with just the right amount of salt, and very satisfying. I highly recommend them. Amazon is the best place to buy them for price and availability."
2,White Rice not for me.,"At first I was happy to find this product in the store, since I am on a gluten free and no white rice diet. The lable on the package says brown rice. Thank you Amazon for noting the ""brown rice"" is actually a combination of white rice and rice bran. It is amazing the amount of flexibility in labeling standards."
1,read SAFETY WARNING!,"""May contain trace amounts of tree nuts, dairy and wheat."" I was ready to order until I saw this info. Not good for a Celiac/Gluten-intolerant person with additional dairy allergy! How can products get away with saying they are gluten-free & then post a little warning that the food may contain wheat???!!! :("
2,Crackers contain SOY.,"Crackers looked fine but I didn't try them because the ingredient list on the package listed soy, which I can't have. I went back and checked the Amazon description and the ingredient list did NOT list soy. Makes me hesitate to order grocery items if I can not trust the information on the description."
3,Hilarious-hilarious-hilarious,When i first heard this song i thought it was hilarous. Then i was talking to a friend and she was talking about how her boyfriend left her for some ugly girl. I started laughing and told her about the song she loved it.
4,I love it!,"When I first heard this song, I honestly didn't like it very much. I thought it was being judgemental. But the more I hear it the more I love it. It just grows on you. When a guy breaks up with you for someone else, it does make you feel ""jealous"" and ""mean."" You want to find everything wrong with this new girl who has taken your place. I can totally relate to this song. I can't stop listening to it!! It's great music!"
4,honest lyrics make this somewhat simple song a hit,When I heard this song on the radio I just had to laugh out loud because it sounded like me talking about the girl my boyfriend cheated on me with.
5,caravan live,Haven't had any Caravan live albums since the New symphona album back in the early 1970ies. did not even know about this album until I started exploring Amazon for Caravan. I think it is phenomanal. If you like Caravan buy it now. If you never heard of Caravan might be a good first CD. But if you are not into the 1974 Canterbury jazz-rock-progressive-classical-pop sound you might not like it so much. And the extended guitar/viola sections are really spot on.
2,"Honestly, I am baffled.","The NinJew is billed as ""Philosophy - Spirituality - Humor - Action - Adventure."" It is a self-published 84-page paperback which jumps wildly from an adventure tale to a workout guide to a nutrition workbook. The text is accompanied by low resolution black and white images of the use of gymnasium equipment and the real-life adventures of the NinJew. Author Richard Walters has promoted his book via a campaign of [...] Friend Requests.The workout and nutritional information are well-founded and easy to follow, but there are plenty of easier-to-use books on the market. The adventure is just weird beyond belief, and the text is smattered with references to G-d and his great Omnimax theater. If you in author Richard Walters's inner circle of friends and family, this is probably a wickedly funny book, but as an outsider, well, I am just baffled. This appears to be a fun gag and nothing more."
2,Warning!,"If you have no experience with spanish, forget about this program. I do believe that this title would be good for someone who already has some classroom spanish experience. Those with no experience will be overwhelmed and lost from the outset with this title."
3,Beginers beware,"This program is almost like watching spanish television with subtitles. It has the spanish dialog & the english translation to the conversations. This is better though, because you can repeat what you missed, and you can get a word by word translation and prononciation. Sure, the dialoge & translation isn't completely perfect, but I found it to be close. Aside from this, i didn't much care for the rest of the CD (vocabulary exercises, travel tips, conversation practice,etc) . Good if you can already read spanish to some degree. Make sure you read the help section. I don't recemend you start with spanish now though. Instead, take a look at something like Pimsluer's courses."
1,Mac Users,"I've used Transparent Language on a PC in the past and it has worked fine but I ordered this item - which it claims works on macs - and when I tried to install it was told that it was not supported on my computer. Mac OSX users beware, I couldn't get it to work on my Mac OSX 10.4.11"
3,Is this the weakest link?,"I admit it. I am not a fan of the Peladon stories.This makes this review a little harder to write but not impossible.To me the two Peladon stories of third Doctor Jon Pertwee mark the nadir of Doctor Who other than the Colin Baker stories.In this one the Doctor arrives on Peladon and is mistaken as the delegate from Earth in the forthcoming peace conference between the Galactic Federation and the planet Peladon.A series of murders, attempted murders and other incidents is attributed to the symbol of the planet, Aggedor.The Doctor, as usual, gets involved, is blamed, cleared and saves the day but even so cannot save this adventure.The concept is OK, the alien Alpha Centauri, male with tentacles and a female voice who is continually panic stricken, is silly, the Ice Warriors are wasted and the Doctor singing to the horned monster shows that he should not give up his day job.Still it is OK for younger viewers."
5,Holmes Heater,You can't beat the Amazon price. Holmes always makes nice electric heaters. Excellent service all around !
4,I added it to my collection,I too checked this one out from the library and promptly purchased it as a reference for my own book collection. I was most inspired by the variety of plants the author highlighted for arranging...I hadn't thought about a lot of the things I already have growing in my own garden in that light before. I also liked her descriptions of the composition of the arrangements.
1,Contains fire hazards shown as arranging advice,"It's quite true that this book shows some lovely and varied flower arrangements. But what concerns me greatly is the picture on page 89 of a grapevine wreath with candles burning beneath it on a mantel. THIS IS A BAD FIRE HAZARD. Please, don't follow the author's example in this - it's too high a risk. Dry, twiggy decorations should never be placed this close to open flame. Nor is it appropriate to place a candle, without a globe around it, to be burned in the center of an arrangement as shown on page 86. Even a green arrangement can be dried to the burning point by a candle flame that close.I wish this was presented as an example of what not to do, instead of as the successful finished product the author shows it as."
5,This is the best incense I have found!,"I have tried dozens of incense varieties over the years. Most I find to be extremely annoying - too sickly sweet and cloying; the smell of many makes me almost ill.This incense has no overpowering 'perfume' odor, but rather smells fresh and clean, something like wood smoke. Highly recommended!"
2,broken,The entire box of incense was in little pieces when i opened it. All the sticks were at least 1/3 their original length. not happy.
1,TARA HEALING INCENSE... STINKS!,"First off they are OVER priced from what you get. SECOND these SMELL like burning paper! Save yourself some money, and just burn some old newspaper!I WOULD NOT buy again NOR DO I recommend these!"
2,Very disappointed.,"The seller sent the book to the wrong zip code, but sent an email of apology and the book arrived a week later. When the book arrived, the binding was in good shape , but the pages were all trimmed unevenly - a big disappointment. The two stars are for the content in the book, which I enjoyed tremendously as a young adult. This item was meant for my mother, but the quality was so shoddy, it is not fit for a gift."
2,"""A lot of hooey,""","says Jones (Walter Connolly) in the last scene of this movie. That about sums it up. Somewhat below average. Barbara Stanwyck wasn't below average. She never is. She is practicing acting as the beautiful, virginal, (if somwhat gullible) missionary Megan Davis. She's about to be married in China to another missionary. There is a riot & she is rescued or kidnaped depending on your point of view by General Yen. He is basically a ruthless criminal played by Nils Asher. Apparently there were no Asian actors in Hollywood in 1933. He falls in love with Megan immediately. But it is unrequited. She is conflicted & may be falling for him. He is very charming. Those look like real tears streaming down Megan's cheek in one close-up. For our time, it's a bit racist. The Chinese are refered to as devils, yellow swine & Orientials. They are looked down at by European diplomats as they are cheated & then converted. I'm glad I saw this movie but I wouldn't sit through it twice."
1,awefull,"This blueray disc sucks, it only has a 640 kbps Dolby Digital sound track, is dull and lifeless. It is an extreme disappointment, what moron authored this disk, Do not buy. My first reaction to the sound was to throw the disc out the window. This a true disappointment for any Brian Setzer fan. Come on no Master Audio. Since I opened the package and can't return it will put it through my shredder."
2,just ok,"was hoping it would be better , one of those you only watch once ..... ........ ...... ... . ."
4,Brians great!!!!!!!!!,"I love Brian setzer but what i love the most is when he goes stone rockabilly. It's here, not enough."
5,Brian Setzer. It's Gonna Rock,This is a great mix of rock and big band. Brian Setzer is an incredible performer and puts his rock signature to music to create this great big band sound.
5,brian setzer big band,"This is a must have dvd for any Setzer collection. It would have to be the best concert I have watched for a long time with Brian and the band doing what they do best, Brian had Montreaul in the palm of his hands with this collection of great songs. You'll just keep watching it"
2,Where's the audio?,"I have to agree with some reviewers that the video on this disc is excellent. Also, the show is excellent. But where was the recording engineer? Blu-Ray format offers sound that will ""blow-your-socks-off"". This DVD does not. Bass is very subdued as are the horns. Sounds like TV sound. The reviewer who said that those of us with premium sound systems are more interested in our systems than in the performance has it half-right. We demand the sound we paid for, especially with the Blu-Ray format! I won't be purchasing Surf Dog products in the future."
4,A Classic Sailing Story for All Time,"It is awesome to read what Joshua Slocum did. His achievement should be celebrated forever. His writing style is not particularly good but the content of the story is unique. All cruising sailors should read this book. Slocum clearly was an outstanding navigator and all around sailor. The section of the book on his adventures going around Cape Horn dealing with the weather, currents, and natives is particularly exciting. This is a story waiting for a Hollywood movie or, even better, a long running TV series."
4,Sailing Alone Around the World,This guy had an interesting view on life. Clearly he knew what he was doing but it always seemed like he was bumbling along when he was sailing around the world. I enjoyed his narrative. Quick read.
2,introduction,"The title could trick you into actually buying this book thinking it could be very good. The book is certainly good if you are a beginner in risk analysis in banking system. However, if you have some experience with it and you have knowledge of risk analysis then this is certainly not the book you would want. The book is written in a very nice, easy to understand language, but it covers concepts in a very basic manner so it might not be suitable for someone who already knows these things, but it would rather be frustrating because you spend [money] on the book. Definitely for the money paid it is not worth it.If you are indeed a beginner in this field then in general this book could be very useful because it gives many examples for almost every concept explained along with the appropriate figures. However, they cover very general concepts. The concepts are well explained. In the appendix there is a nice very detailed example of the analysis of a specified bank. It is very detailed."
5,One of the best books of all time.,"I adore this novel and the Baroness' writing style. I'll admit that I chose this version for its cover, but had always wanted to read the novel. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. This is a great book for anyone who is a fan of historical dramas, adventure and/or romance. It's definitely a great book for both sexes and many ages!"
4,"Spy thriller, action adventure, and romance all rolled into this classic","This book was thoroughly enjoyable. It almost seems way ahead of it's time as an 1800s version of the modern thriller novel. This book is a great adventure and a spy thriller set in the time of the bloody French Revolution. It has romance, action, espionage, twists and turns, and fun characters. At times the plot is fairly predictable, but it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is a fun and entertaining read if not deep. Definitely recommended as a light summer read and an alternative to much of today's popular novels."
5,One of my favorite fiction stories.,"The book is a great read with one of the best heroes ever created in fiction. The love story is also maybe a bit fantastical, but so amazing. Guys and girls alike should both love it."
5,A Great Classic!,My only problem that I have with the Scarlet Pimpernel is that I can never read it for the first time again and feel that old suspenseful feeling.As it is I always feel a thrill of excitement when I read it. The romance is captivating and the adventure is original and breathtaking.Orczy weaves a splendid plot holding the reader in exquisite suspense to the last page.I recommend this for anybody!
2,"Slow, Dull",I had to read this book for English class my freshman year. I thought it was so slow and boring I had to force my self to read it.
3,Average,When I read this book I was disappointed. Marguerite's attitude to her husband is revolting. She treats him like a piece of meat until she finds out her husband's secret. Then she has a sudden change of personality. Many other characters had personal flaws which I did not like and the fact that the Scarlet Pimpernel escaped without harm and the way he did it is truly deus ex machina. The identity of the Scarlet Pimpernil is obvious very early in the book as well. How did this become a Puffin classic?
1,My god this book is boring,"I had to read this in 7th grade for English, and I could barley stay awake for it. It takes the character about 5 pages to do something as simple as pour themselves a glass of milk. We read this book in class and half of the class was asleep while reading it. If you heard the groan of horror in my class every time the teacher said get out the Scarlet Pimpernel book, you wouldn't even consider reading it."
1,Obvious and cliched,"No doubt this was great reading 100 years ago. But to a modern reader, the book's age is apparent on every page. The central mystery of the book (the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel) is obvious well before it is revealed. The dialog is distractingly archaic and upper crust. The thoughts and concerns of the main character (Marguerite) are plain, without nuance or complexity, and by the end I was gritting my teeth every time she was described as ""the cleverest woman in Europe."" The book's first sentence is great, and the first chapter is very good, but it's downhill from there. Baroness Orczy may have invented a genre of literature, but it is so familiar to us now that the original appears tired. It gets one star for illuminating historical aspects of the French Revolution."
5,Great service,"My wife and I had watched the movie ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" and immediately wanted to read the original book.Amazon.com was easy to use to find the book and order from. The book was everything we hoped and we thank Amazon.com for their prompt professonal service in making the book available to us.The book was every bit as exciting to read as the movie was to watch.THANK YOU AMAZON.COM!"
5,A Classic French Revolution Romance Novel,"I am a huge fan of the classics and this book is definitely a classic. This is a gripping tale of terror during the French Revolution and how one man, the Scarlet Pimpernel, and his followers decide to take a stand by helping people out of France. Meanwhile the brother of one of England's most important people, Lady Marguerite Blakeney (who is originally from France), married to Sir Percy Blakeney, returns to France on business. Soon after Percy also goes off to France on business. Then the French agent Chauvelin comes to Lady Blakeney with stunning evidence of her brother's treason against France and blackmails her into helping him find and apprehend the Scarlet Pimpernel, whom she admires from afar. But it turns out that nothing is quite as it seems..."
4,"Excellent, but it takes 50 pages to get into","I normally write long reviews, but I think I already said everything I need to say. This is a great story, and it will stick with you. I still smile when I think about it. I'm smiling right now, actually.The problem with the book is that it takes very long to get into. My mother gave up, and she can normally make it past these things. I was determined to read it, and once the plot actually started, I didn't want to put it down. The book's not that long, which makes it easier to manage than some classics.I DO recommend the book. I couldn't give it 5 stars, but it is honestly exciting. Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel? I would be cruel if I told you."
5,"read it, trust me!","I read this book for English class, mostly because we were going to see the broadway show, and I wanted to see if I would like it...The book was great (though I'll admit, it's a bit slow in the begining), and the show blew me away! Read the book, it's fantastic, and, if you ever get a chance, see the show, It's the funniest broadway show I've ever seen!"
5,Surprisingly a good read,"I had to read this book for English class. Instead of it being the usual trash, I found it to be very entertaining and engrossing. Sir Percy Blakney, is percieved as a stupid nobleman by most of his peers. However, that is only a cover for his true identity, the Scarlet Pimpernel. He rescues French nobility who are about to be decapitated by Madame Guillotine. The peasants hate him and the nobles love him. Great love story too. Excellent book and won't take too long to read."
2,*YAWN*,"I loved the book version, but boy, the audio version was a dissapointment. The readings were a bit dull, and it was reallly REALLY long. This is one of my all time favorite stories, but even my partiality to this story wasn't ebough to sustain my interest in these extremely dragging tapes."
3,One sided in the extreme,"While I am no fan of political correctness, this is in fact a rather one sided view on the results of integrating American schools. As one who went to intergrated schools in the 1970s, I find some of what Wolters writes about undeniable. Yes there were many riots and yes not all Black kids were the innocent heroes often portayed in TV-movies of this era. But to completely dismiss school integration as a failure is asinine. Those of us who have experienced this era must also admit that in spite of the problems we had during this period, positive results such as lasting frinedship and better understanding among the races DID happen frequently (""Remember the Titans,"" anyone?).If Wolters and others would like to go back to the days of seperate and unequal de jure schools and when fear prevented interracial friendships, they are welcome to take a trip on a one-way time machine backward. Meanwhile, many of us enjoy the present and the future just fine."
3,Lowe great / Movie not so much,"A really solid, believable performance by Rob Lowe...very against type more than any film I've seen him do. Lowe wouldn't have been on my casting list NOT because he isn't a good actor just I never saw him do a role as this, which elevates him to a GREAT actor! He plays 10-15 years older than himself with such cocky arrogance Peterson himself must have been flattered and proud to have a name such as Lowe's portray him! The movie itself doesn't live up to Lowe's performance. I wish it started from THE BEGINNING of the story but starts more 2/3rds into the story. You end up feeling like you missed an hour of the movie or something. The Lacey Petersen movie with Dean Cain was much better done.Still worth the buy, just hang loose 3-4 months and pick it up for $2.00 + shipping."
2,Drew Peterson:Untouchable,"Even though Rob Lowe did a nice job in his role, overall I thought the movie was pretty poor. It definitely seemed like a ""made for TV"" movie. If you're bored, it may be something to watch, but I think there a lot of better movies out there."
3,an early Rossellini film,"Il Generale Della Rovere is a film directed by Roberto Rossellini.It follows the true World War II era story of an Italian pickpocket that is hired by the Nazis to impersonate a dead Italian general. Under this persona he interrogates a prisoner to gain tactical information.The film is very interesting and found it to have some good scenes.The special features are a theatrical trailer, interviews with Roberto Rossellini's family members, and a video essay about the film."
2,History of mourning jewelry mostly just history,"I had hoped this would be more than just a history book of mourning jewelry. More examples, much more, would have been the perfect ""history"" of what was produced during the ""mourning jewelry period"". I was dissappointed with this entire book."
5,Get it and read it!,"Get it and read it. You will find the treasure in this book. Never seen any work that explains the entire picture of bible in such a clear and neat way. Dr. Scroggie's unique ability makes this book a must for every student of God's word! It is such a good book that after reading this, you want to study God's words more diligently since you find you missed so much!"
5,Great Bible commentary and creative approach,"W. Graham Scroggie wrote a fantastic overview of the Bible in this classic work. He wrote with a unique and creative approach. He divided sections of the Bible into scenes of a drama. His writing was very interesting and excellent from a literary standpoint.The doctrine that Scroggie employs is solid. He writes from a dispensational Baptist perspective. He does not get off into strange tangents, but provides accurate commentary from an established doctrinal school of thought. The book is written at a level where a layperson with an intermediate knowledge of the Bible can glean a lot from the book.This is a good overview of each book of the Bible. It is not a verse by verse exegetical commentary. I enjoyed the book very much. I received it as a Christmas present one year from my mother and I loved it. It is a terrific book and a delightful read."
3,A Better Description Would Have Helped,"I bought this item as a gift and was not completely pleased with it. First off, unlike the picture, the unit only has 2 frames, not three. And also it is quite small for [the] price tag. Other than that, it is a satisfactory item."
4,It was scary.,"I got this CD before I had learned anything in Portugese, not even hello. It was scary. Total immersion was just not going to cut it for the complete novice. I got the Living Language book/cassette combo, went through that, THEN this CD became useful. The CD is overall a pretty nice set-up. It has video, pictures, read along, and you can even record your own voice (which just confirmed how much practice I need). There are a few long passages you can listen to while watching the pictures roll by and/or while reading the words. The passages are interesting to, about The samba, and Rio de Janiero. Not your typical ""Oi, tudo bem? This is still a beginners CD, but once you have finished a beginners book/cassette, it will make a world of difference, and the immersion won't be quite as scary."
5,Love You Independent Woman,"This is a good book. Ms. Betty Neels has passed away, but I love her books. Most of them are keepers. Keep them coming, publishers."
4,Whipping Aussie Yarn,"What a treat to finally experience this long forgotten show, filmed in Australia.Great to see younger versions of Chipps Rafferty, Chuck Faulkner, Jack Fegan, Leonard Teale and Reg Livermore . Missing was Michael Pate (working in the US) and Charles Tingwell (working in England). The 34 episodes tackled aspects of Australia's early colonial history with a sympathetic view of our indigenous people. The American actor Peter Graves did an admirable job as Christopher Cobb. The quality of the transfer is excellent . Highly recommended."
2,No Bueno,"I own an Italian restaurant and have many pizza cutters. This cutter was not very efficient.Each slice had to be cut ,multiple times, and that was during ""our test"" during the first week of use. I doubt it would hold up very well over time."
2,Plastic Breakdown,While it does have a nice weight and feel....the blade does not hold up and begins to chip after extended use.
3,A bit of a let-down,"This product is a good idea but it didn't work as well as I expected it to. Further, its size makes it awkward to store. For what it costs, I expected a more effective product. The plus side is that it didn't scratch our pans (which was why we bought it in the first place) but we found this to be a bit of a let-down. We had also hoped to use it for cutting brownies in the non-stick pan, but that didn't work out either because of the size of the wheel - it really can't get too close to the end of the pan. Disappointed......"
2,Does Not Match!,"Mario Batali's products are very hit or miss on if they match. Even though they all list as ""Persimmon"" in color. Images displayed are not correct. Color is actually a burnt orange. Check customer images for a comparison of Three Batali items."
4,Successful Fly Fishing Strategies Volumes 1 & 2,"These informative videos will prove to be valuable resourses for anyone hoping to learn the basics (and beyond) of flyfishing. They are quite complete. Lafontaine and Sharon cover such techniques as deep and shallow water nymphing, dry and wet fly fishing in a variety of water types, and even lake fishing. Even more impressive is the fact that they emphasized (not just glossed over) the importance of reading the water and anticipating the location and behavior of trout *before* trying to randomly catch them.Excellent camera work."
5,Successful Fly Fishing Strategies,"As I am new to fly fishing, this DVD was recommended to me by a good friend. I am impressed with the clear explanations of the kinds of choices a fly fisher can have in a particular location. I couldn't wait to get out on the water to try what I'd learned, and just this past week, I was able to. Using what I learned from the ""SFFStrategies"" DVD, I amazed myself (as well as my much more experienced friends who were fishing with me) with how well I did and how much knowledge I had picked up. I now realize that the observations and analyzation Gary talks about are really valuable, and I also better appreciate the entertaining humor these guys show."
5,Absolutely super!,"two words: Absolutely super!A must have in your dvd collection.Cheers,Lino Catucci"
4,Good practical source.,"One of the best ""how to"" fishing videos I've ever seen.With that said, they spend time on blue ribbon locations that for the most part are devoid of other anglers. Almost anyone will catch fish at those locations and not alot of, ""we wanted to dry fly fish at location X but there were already others fishing the spot so we switched to location Y and decided to nymph after nothing rose to drys because we caught these nymphs with a seine,"" which is more realistic of the challenges that the average person faces when fly-fishing.But again, overall a very good and helpful DVD that I would recommend to any flyfisher-person."
2,Disappointed,"Maybe this is a good DVD for beginners but I honestly have to say the only pointer I learned from was under the title ""A Walk in the Woods"" or something like that. I found the ""small talk"", ""banter"" or as others have called it, ""humor"" to be very irritating. And speaking of irritating...the dog !!! VERY, VERY irritating. Just not the kind of DVD for me."
1,Nothing new here,"I was disappointed to find nothing in this work I hadn't already read in several other Oppenheimer biographies. Dr. Cassidy seems to have taken upon himself the mantle of chief apologist for Dr. Oppenheimer, dismissing any and all evidence for his leftist connections while consistently leveling equally specious charges against his accusers. In short, if you want fresh insights into this complex personality you will be disappointed. If, however, you share Dr. Cassidy and Dr. Oppenheimer's political bent, you should find this a rewarding read."
2,Don't buy this movie,This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen in a long time. The plot was so loose you could hardly tell there was one. The movie dragged very much throughout. I had to fast forward some of it because I could not stand for lack of action to happen. Whoever wrote this was a terrible screen writer. The director must have been asleep. Some of the actors were really terrible. It was an offbeat movie made practically by family members. I think that might have contributed to the problem of lack of distance from the characters and loose plot. It was just terrible. I am sorry I wasted my money on this. And it wasn't about a horse at all. It was all about a girl who was coping with the loss of her mother. Unfortunately the girl was unable to show any emotion. The horse had about five minutes in the 96 minute film.
5,Great family movie if you love horses.,"Introduces Heidi Creel to the screen in the lead role, Natalie. Filmed in the mountainous scenery of Nevada and Oregon chronocling the tale a young woman who is perfectly happy until her mother dies on Valentine's Day. From then on her only memories of her mother are connected to a white flower and a horse named Rose. A beautiful love story that proves that love can never die and can be found in the remotest of places, a horse farm where childhood summers were spent and her mother grew up. A wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy."
2,heart worming story,"the reson for natalie to go home is a teare jurker, and the white rose that plays a big part in the movie. the rose was like her mother coming back to give one last gift to her dother, to help her let go, and a way for her sprit to make pice with the one that hurt as so, thay to can move on, her sprit is free to go to haven. at the end is the most wonderful and teare full part of the hole move"
1,Porn Quality Without the Porn,I will never get back the hours I spent watching this film. The plot is on par with the worst low budget porn films and the acting isn't much better. Here's an idea. Why not lose the plot and just get it on with the horse. Now that's something I'd pay to see!!
2,Not up to par,"I'm a big fan of this author and recently purchased whatever paperbacks I didn't already have. They were not available via Kindle. The book has some humor, but not the typical character development that is usually so realistic in the author's books.There were interesting parts, but mostly it was hum-drum reading. I enjoyed the ""asides"" but even those started to become predictable. I purchased this paperback on Amazon."
3,Love and Criminal Activity From A Diffirent Angle,"Judy Holliday plays the delightful role of Laura Partrige, a naive young actress who had just inherited 10 shares to one of the country's biggest corporation. Through her kindness and street-smart she was able to land a job with the company, unify its small stockholders and give the boot to its crooked board of directors. All this while she manages to fall in love with the company's alienated founder.The film is light and funny with Holliday pulling off her dumb blonde routine to the hilt. However, the dialogue was always constantly there to remind you that underneath that vail of innocence is the smarts and the kind heart of a street smart executive. The other cast member were terrific in pulling off their lines making this a memorable film for anyone who loves the underdog win."
2,Where are the laughs?,"This film has some good people: Abe Burrows(Screenwriter) wrote the libretto for the musical Guys & Dolls; George S. Kaufman co-wrote the play on which the film was based; aand the star is theterrific July Holiday (see Born Yesterday). But something goes radically wrong. There is nothing at all funny here, and the story is dull and ridiculous. It is about dishonest business executives in a large public company (great timeliness!), but the authors seem to know nothing about this subject."
5,Awesome Final Entry for the Temptation line,"Wild child bartender, Cat Sheehan is about to have a life altering change when the bar she's part owner in, Temptation, must close down for good. In moving forward from this sad moment she's decided to reform herself, starting with her choices in men. Nice Guys only from now on.Dylan Spencer, a sinfully gorgeous bad boy musician enters Temptation and Cat's best intentions go by the way side in favor of one last fling. She just can't resist him.No woman could.But Dylan has a secret, not the least of which is what the G in his band's name the Four G's stands for. Dylan is not a bad boy nor is he a stranger to Cat Sheehan.HER LAST TEMPTATION is a very sexy, very funny, and alas final entry in the Harlequin Temptation line. It is also a huge Must Read by Leslie Kelly.HER LAST TEMPTATION is a Collector's Edition and one of the best Leslie Kelly books I've ever read...and I've read them all.Don't miss HER LAST TEMPTATION."
4,The Sassy Side of Poetry,"Shelley has remained hard-to-find, but she is well worth the searching out. Her music is untouched and passionately written. Captain Wild Horse is one of my most played albums."
5,All-Around Excellent Reference,"I agree with all preious reviews and can only add that I have a copy of this, have given 2 copies as gifts, and just purchased another for my daughter...Anyone who browses through it while in my kitchen learns something!!!"
5,For a non-golfer...,"...I was given the book by a friend who felt sure I would like it, even though I don't play golf. I have only one real comment. I wished the book was longer! I would certainly look for a sequel."
5,pam east enamel bead making video,"I have long waited to get a copy of this instructional video, since reading about it years ago. Did not know it had ever been released until very recently. It met all my hopes and expectations. The pictures are clear, and the detail is well shown. This is one of those videos that you really feel you can follow and make the desired product satisfactorily, even the mistakes one might make are shown, and solved."
5,It's so easy!,This video breaks it all down step-by-step so anyone could make these gorgeous enamel beads. And Pam never lectures you in a boring way. It's like having a best friend show you how to do something in your own kitchen rather than taking a class. A GREAT new hobby and you can get all the tools and supplies directly from her.
1,Piece of Crap,"Terrible! Do not purchase....only 15min RUNNING TIME (product description lists 60min running time!). Basically a SHOW/TELL dvd...unless you have had some WC training in the forms..you will not be able to LEARN the FORMS from this DVD...maybe. In fact, both WEAPON FORMS demonstrated here are worthless. Save yourself some CASH and if you want to see how the forms look, just buy a book on the subject or visit YOUTUBE. This is such a total piece of CRAP."
4,Great for AP American History,"If you are looking for a text to supplement your AP History classes, this book has lots of good material, and many helpful readings. If you combine this with some history readers, you will have a great basis to get your program off to a positive start."
1,Pass this one by,This wookbook is certainly not worth the money. It has very few pages and poor maps. A teacher clearly put this together for her own use but the number of questions and the grey shade maps and charts provided make this item of little value.
2,Human anatomy for art students,"more text than pictures, and even the pictures or in bad order,with not much comprehension as to the different anatomy groups,all pics are isolated and there are close to no real life photographs.very small drawings, so no descriptive view of the various muscles(manyof which are left out) there are plenty of cheap books to purchase, leavethis one on the screen, Recommends:if you want a cheap, great anatomy bookget ART STUDENTS' ANATOMY EDMOND J FARRIS."
3,Bean's on the Roof,"I have read the book called ""Baen's on the Roof"". String Bean witch is George sees Anna george's sister is on the roof. string runs to his mom. She said that Anna was writing a roof poem. So string wants to write a poem also. So his mom lets him go write a poem just a long as he doesn't bother his sister.This was a good book I plan on reading more of her books. This a book about poem writing. Read this book and find out the rest."
2,Disapointed,it had skips in the movie in the disk.Dont know whether it was from finger prints that was on the disk.
5,"Quirky, but we liked it","This movie didn't get a wide showing in the theaters, but I wish it had. A young man is trying to do right, an old man is trying to right a wrong, and off-hand comments that are absolutely hysterical."
1,Duvall Disappoints,"How could anything Robert Duvall be in, be bad. I put this one in the Good-Will collection immediately. No second watching."
4,Robert Duvall At His Best,"Duvall, Murray and Spacek turn in great performances in Get Low. Though some claim that the film moves too slowly, it is perfect for laying out Duvall's character. I did feel that the confession was a bit weak considering the build-up, but this is a well-done movie that left enough mystery and questions unanswered that I want to get the book and dig deeper into Bush's story. This movie, like The Apostle, didn't get the publicity it deserved."
5,Excellent story - Excellent acting = Wake up Hollywood!,"I'll join all the others that are surprised that this film failed to get its just recognition.Super story line. A believable environment. Some of Duvall's best acting moments. His funeral speech is riveting and a bit of an acting lesson.If you're not a reality show junkie, this movie is probably for you. Enjoy."
5,Should Have Been In Contention For Best Actor And Best Picture,"Robert Duvall should have been in contention for an oscar with his complicated portrayal of Felix Bush, a 40-year hermit from the mountains of Tennessee. Bill Cobbs' performance was also remarkable as an Illinois preacher. In actuality, all the acting was stellar. Bill Murray was worth his weight in yen as the more-than-happy-to-oblige funeral director. This innovative storyline of Felix's wish for his own funeral service during his lifetime was perfectly-paced to let each character unfurl. And it was just the right length. Both the photography and costuming were stunning and gave the impression that this really was bound by that period in time. Even the currency had a look of authenticity from back in the days of the Great Depression. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack, especially Alison Krauss' splendidly apropos ""Lay My Burden Down""."
3,Old School,"No special effects or much action in this movie, but still it is a good movie to watch.It is about a hermit (wonderfully played by Robert Duvall) who live in the woods isolated from the towns people. As the story develops, we understand more and more why he decided to live like a hermit: to punish himself for the mistake that he made 40 years or so earlier. In fact, he publicly discloses his mistake in the climax of the movie towards the end.Bill Murray is very funny, in a serious manner that he plays his role as funeral director. Good cast, good acting, and good plot."
4,Old pros deliver the goods.,"""Get Low"" is a winning, well-acted shaggy-dog story that showcases a polished, considered performance by Robert Duvall. The man has aged into one of our finest hams (that's not an insult) and his every gesture and facial expression is calibrated and controlled for maximum impact. Bill Murray wisely accepts the role of second banana and underplays his character, selling his lines with a dry, behind-the-beat inflection. Lucas Black does some excellent non-verbal acting, providing the glue between Duvall and Murray. There really isn't much for Sissy Spacek to do, but it's wonderful to see her and she fleshes out a rather flat character. I'm not sure how this movie was passed over by all the awards panels, but if you like polished, low-key, high-quality entertainment, you should see ""Get Low."""
5,"Suspenseful, dramatic, pensive and simple","I stumbled upon this movie while looking for something to watch early one winter morning. What a fantastic find! Robert Duvall was outstanding, as was the rest of the cast. No special effects, no stunts, no forced humor, just the right mix of folk story, early Americana, a love story, a troubled protagonist, and superb acting."
2,"Good Production, Pathetic Story","Cinematography, sets, wardrobes, sound, acting - all good to excellent. The story itself is a poor - the entire movie hinges on a dark secret Robert Duvall's character keeps. Near the end, when that secret is revealed the critical viewer will discern the severe problems with the alleged implications of the ""secret"". This is a classic, typical, case of Hollywood trying to make a point with a fist full of mush."
2,Laborious....,It took me 4 sittings to get through this movie. It moves like molasses on a cold Vermont day. The acting is fine but the story takes too long to develop and the viewer will easily get distracted.
2,much ado about nothing,"I am a great fan of Robert Duvall, but the newly released filmGet Low, also starring Bill Murray and Cissy Spacek, is aterrible waste of time -- promising horrific revelations aboutan old man (Duvall) who has been a hermit for 40 years, butfinally yielding nothing that was worth the wait. Skip it --itis a two-hour shaggy dog story -- you will derive moreenjoyment from rearranging your sock drawer."
3,Get Ready,"Surprisingly, surprisingly good. Ultimately, this story is about repentance and preparing to meet the Creator....One hesitation which I had was an uncertainty as to whether the wrongness of adultery was being adequately conveyed."
4,Liked it!,"Enjoyed this movie tremendously. I knew of the story line for 25+ years and enjoyed it being on screen. There was some ""license"" taken with the original story line so would have preferred that it follow more closely the original circumstances but assume that had to be in order to attack an audience. All the actors did an excellent job!"
4,Get Low,"This was a good movie - I liked it more than my husband did. Enjoyed the performances of Bill Murray, Robert Duval, and Sissy Spacek. I'll watch it again."
5,Movie Review,"We had rented this movie, and loved it. Purchased 3 more copies as gifts, and will be purchasing more.It has a unique story line, with an extremely good message. Totally enjoyed it."
4,Good story,"Well, it's Robert Duvall. Do I really need to say much more. He's such a great actor, although, I thought the supporting case were great also."
5,Excellent Recording,The Coro de la Catedral de Mexico perform baroque sacred works from the Latin American colonies.The works on this recording:Francisco Hernandez (1517-1587)1. Sancta Mariae2.

5,Pieces from Life's Crazy Quilt,"This journey to the Detroit of the 1930s and 40s also takes the reader on a ride through the first years of a young African American girl's life--her relationships with family, church, and community, her growth toward an understanding of her own potential. Marvin Arnett's story is bright with both humor and poignancy as she clearly draws her characters and their struggles in a pre-Civil Rights American city. Her voice is clear and plain-spoken, and she creates an intimacy for the reader with person and place that will stay in the mind indefinitely.Read this book for its history, but read it also for its humanity. Marvin Arnett believes in humankind. The book is a testament to that hope."
2,Slow Going,"Few historical figures have been written about as much as Gaius Julius Caesar. In addition to straight history, there are innumerable works of fiction, not the least of which is William Shakespeare's play.Allan Massie seems to be keenly aware that he is on heavily trodden ground, and struggles to find something new or fresh to add. He studiously avoids all the dramatic moments (most major events happen off-stage) and the result is a very slow-paced, uninvolving book. Despite the addition of much fanciful gossip about the sex lives of the famous characters, it was a struggle for me to keep reading. Fortunately, the book is short enough and Massie's writing is literate, so I did read on to the end.However, after Massie's earlier Augustus and Tiberius, which I enjoyed very much, this one falls flat and was a major disappointment."
4,Expensive but good,Name brand ink seems to work better in my printer. Just wish it wasn't so expensive.
4,no complaints,What is there to say?...it's great ink. I use it in my Epson 2200. My only wish would be the cost being lower. :)
4,"Slow to start, but picks up later","As with any game, Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch has its good and its bad.Pros:Decent storyline, even though it takes awhile to really get to.Even though some of the characters are rather exaggerated, some of them are quite fun.Cons:Characters, while they all have their own personalities, aren't always written all that believably.Boring game play: go to town, get mission. Complete mission, go back to town. Repeat throughout game.Long ending scene. You'll be ready to move on to your next adventure by the time you've finished watching the end movie.If you're looking for an outstanding rpg to lose yourself in, keep looking. If you're just in the market for something to tide you over until the next big thing comes along, Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch is worth a shot."
3,decent,"the storyline is nice/sad. Pretty straightforward game. cute characters. Two village kids setting out on a coming-of-age journey to make them 'adults' in the eyes of their village. But these 2 kids *were they 14 and 15* just happen to 'manage' to save the entire world. It's got its funny/bizarre parts. buy it used or something for a cheaper price tho, i wowuldn't spend too much on it b/c its not that amazing of a game...."
2,"Okay, but not much of a tool","I had my reservations about purchasing this tool due to the description being a little off base......as if it was describing an electric shaver. It does not require the two AA batteries, rather, it has a rechargable power pack inside. It does not have surgical steel blades that easily cut hair. It does work okay, just okay, but for $14.00 I guess that's about how good it works. Built inexpensively and priced accordingly. If you want okay, this will fill the order."
2,Poor performance,It does not have a powerful enough motor needed to really polish (shine) my shoes.I had an old one that was at least twice as powerful but it was over 20 years old & just wore out.
1,Horrible!,This is a horrible product. It doesn't have the strength to rotate the brush while it's touching a shoe. Do not buy this!
2,Not For Serious Latin Students,"Though this program may help you memorize common Latin phases, it fails to help develop basic skills that are needed in learning Latin. The program is not designed to build vocabulary, nor does it enhance ones understanding of the grammar. If anything it confused me. The graphics and visual experience is well done, but this is not a Latin Course. Though the Wheelocks Textbook has been very helpful as a beginner's Textbook."
1,"Poor value, not a course","I was very disappointed with this programme. It is one of the worst language programmes I have ever seen.I have studied Latin before and know many words and the basic grammar, but even I found it difficult to cope with the total immersion approach. The descriptions of the grammar were completely inadequate.This course would be very little use to beginners or advanced learners; and only a moderate help to intermediate students of Latin."
2,No help for a beginner,I bought this software in the hope of getting an interactive start with Latin. Instead the tutorial jumps straight into a complicated text without laying down any basics. Perhaps it might be more useful to advanced students but I got nothing out of it.
3,Underwater images,Unfortunately the wonderful images didn't survive the time (original in 1991). But there are splendid scenes. Manta ray dance with Maria Callas' voice is unforgettable.
3,VX5300 firmware v4 fix,"Found this when I was having trouble. Might help.If it denies access in bitpim (shows it is connected, but will not upload or download) you can try switching the settings to vx8700, get data from the phonebook (it will return an error), click continue, switch the settings back to vx5300, then try sending your data. It might return the same error as before, .e.g. ""access blocked by provider"" but as long as the bottom status bar fills up to completion, it might still work. Reboot the phone to see if your data went through.Good luck."
4,"a little complicated, but well worth it","once you get past the install, and the complex search for software, it is real easy to get mp3s on your phone as ring tones. any mp3 on your computer. the software comes with a converter that allows you to reduce the bi-rate, and even pick the lenth and location of the clip you use, start your ringtone at the begining of the song, or the middle, or use the last 30 seconds. i'm pretty happy with it."
3,"works, with a little finesse","I tried to use the ""software"" included on the CD, but it was just a bunch of html files with dead links. It took a bunch of google searches and forum browsing, but I finally found some drivers that worked with my phone and the cable...I also must note that the cable did not have the right slots on the phone end, and so I had to scratch some of the plastic off, but otherwise it works fine and has not ruined my phone.I use bitpim for connecting to my phone."
2,"eh, you get what you pay for","It's not bad, but what do you expect for $3 or however much it is? It does connect to the phone, but it doesn't QUITE fit as well as I expected it to. Seeing as how I broke my last phone's contact pins, I'm not going to risk it with this cable."
2,"Good, Cheap, Incomplete","Works to connect the device but with no software that can handle a transfer... it does nothing except connect. I was hoping that the phone would show up in windows explorer as a mass storage device, now I am searching for software so I can make this work."
1,Software Useless,I have Vista on my laptop and do alot of traveling and wanted to connect to internet using USB Date Cable..software is not compatible with Vista ..waste of money!
3,Did the job,"Works but not made really great. Kind of flimsy but this was the only usb charging cable that I could find for this phone. Still works but does not stay in the phone that great anymore. If you do buy, you need to take care with the phone connector and it will do what you need."
1,LG Sync Cable,I got the sync cable in only a few days after I ordered it.I tried to revive an LG VX 8300 with no success; then I tried it on a functioning LG VX 8300 - no communications between the phone and the computer.Bottom line: Looks nice but does not work.
4,Rey gets his props,"This is another of the WWE's 14 inch figures. This one features Rey Mysterio, one of the smallest, but most talented pro wrestlers in the WWE. The figure does a great job capturing Rey's image. This is a great figure for any WWE fan. My only real complaint is that it is exactly the same size as the other figures (obviously), but Rey is so much smaller than the rest. I think it would have been really cool if they made the Rey figure about 13 inches, not to mock Mysterio, but to make interaction with the other figures more realistic.Still, wrestling fans, Mysterio fans and figure collectors will love this figure."
3,Not as good as some others,"This book essentially has a one-liner on each page showing a toddler and a potty-oriented thing -- usually comments that children make, or a line explaining the picture. E.g., ""mark tries all the potties before picking the one he likes best"", ""laura teaches the bear how to use the potty"", etc. There is no story; each picture and usage is different although several overlap. In my experience, this book was good for a few days but my child did not stay interested. Once upon a Potty, What do you do with a Potty, and The Princess and the Potty have kept her interest and she continues to read them regularly."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be disappointing. There wasn't a story and my son didn't really pay much attention to the book. He understands and enjoys books better when there is a storyline that he can follow. Though it is good that there are many different races of children shown, the names given were difficult to pronounce. My son has very much enjoyed ""Once Upon a Potty for Boys"" and I would recommend that."
1,Didn't impress me,I bought four books about potty training and this was the worst! Made no sense (must admit I am no child psychologist) and my child remembers and understands the other three books and wants to read them over and over again unlike this one. I wouldn't recommend it at all.
2,It's ok,I just bought this to help my daughter understand more about the potty. But she doesn't seem to interested in this book & she loves books. She prefers everyone poops over this one
4,"not a linear text, but a true map!","This book is a map or a model of spiritual ascension that can be used by anyone, as ascension is affecting everyone on the planet.It is not written in a linear manner, so certain sections will ""spring out"" to you depending upon where you are in the lightbody process.For beginners, it makes no sense upon the first read, and sounds crazy on the second read. It is designed to bury pieces of its truth within your spirit. (that comment should comfort and not scare, so process your fear!)I recommending reading it through, then picking it up again and again as the years go by. This is an authoritative channel.Remember, however, it is only a ""map."" You may prefer another map, which is fine as long as it helps you arrive at your destination on time!"
5,Enlightening and peace-giving,"I found myself having so many ""ah-ha"" moments while reading and feeling this wisdom. Many themes of inner-knowing were touched and restored. It's not a fast read for me because each message is a feast. Practical. Mind-opening."
4,FRESH SOUND,"Jimmy Heath - tenor and sop saxTony Purrone - guitarBen Brown - bassAlbert Tootie Heath - drumsNot just another tenor sax quartet recording. Guitar rather than piano in rhythm section gives this recording a fresh sound. Heath has a light sound on his tenor, and also plays tasteful soprano. A mix of styles and tempos, well played. Fine SteepleChase recording."
1,disappointing,"This is a very amatuerish DVD, in which many still photos are displayed repetitiously.The narration is clearly totally impromptu - not planned or arranged in any orderly manner.It's not very helpful in understanding the subject at all."
4,Not Perfect But Pretty Darn Good,"I've taken this newspaper on and off for several years. Whenever I let my subscription lapse, I miss it. There's lots of very interesting and useful information that isn't in other newspapers or magazines, plus I always enjoy the fiction sections as well as the puzzle pages. Unfortunately, there are more mistakes (typos) than I'd like to see, but you just have to overlook them."
1,dont waste your money,"i liked his first book, i thought i would learn something new, but mistaken, your money is better spent elsewhere"
2,"Interesting, But Too Dated to Be of Much Use",Darvas has a lot of useful information in terms of market timing and stock selection in his other books. This offering provides tips on purchasing over-the-counter stocks using 1970s technology and has no real usefulness today other than as historical background material.
3,WUUUUUUUUUU TANGGGGGGGGGGGG!!,"overall this DVD is pretty good but not worth the price. The special features only have a RZA video and a Cappadonna video with two lousy commercials added to them. The performances were pretty solid but ODB looks tired and restless as he sits on the speakers throughout the show. 34 songs were played on the setlist including the hits ""Triumph"", ""Shimmy Shimmy Y'all"", and ""M.E.T.H.O.D Man"", to name a few. This DVD is only intended for the hardcore Wu-Tang fan so if your expecting alot from this DVD then your best bet is to cop a used copy of this or borrow it from a friend."
2,More disappointing than funny,"The title of my review says it all, the whole thing was more disappointing than funny."
3,childhood memories,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and enjoying it. I haven't seen it in a long time but remember it having those twins from Kindergarten cop in it. If you liked Problem Child you'll definately enjoy this film. From what I remember it's basically about these twin body builders who are called upon as a last resort to babysit these rich twin terrors! Then after some hilarious pranks are pulled, one of the boys decides to runaway while the other no longer wants to be mean to the new sitters. But instead the boys are kidnapped and the twin sitters save them. I guess the funniest parts in this movie were the twin guys with the muscles coming down the street in that huge wheeled truck and the kids getting them into all sorts of hilarious mishaps! Worth a view, both corny and funny. You should order a pizza and other junk food when watching this movie!"
5,THIS MOVIE PROBABLY RULES,"I haven't even seen this movie, but I know it's good. I agree with William (review above).C'mon, the Barbarian Brothers? Big muscles? Babysitting? The kids from Kindergarten Cop? I really don't need anything else but these things in my life."
3,Ok,"Not too crazy about the fit,but I like them just the same. I don't wear them out, just around the house"
3,Good for what it is,"This is a copy of what I believe is the first translation of Tasso into English from 1600. Translated within roughly 50 years of the original the translator keeps the rhyme scheme of the Italian and in doing sacrifices accuracy of meaning. However, in comparing this work to several more recent translations I actually prefer this on a line by line basis as the more recent translations sacrifice poetics to keep meaning. The real problem with this edition is that it has no footnotes, no introduction, nothing but the translated text itself. If you do not know something about epic poetry, Virgil (who is often referenced or imitated by the poet), Tasso's personal history and the first crusade you will be lost and there is nothing here to help you."
2,Great story but ....,"While I enjoyed reading the sections of the book about the difficulties the family went through with their children, there was way too much time spent on details of fund-raising and starting the company. I found myself skipping more pages than I was reading."
3,More business than science,"This is a business book and not a scientific book, so I was a little disappointed."
1,Where is Mexico?,I bought this guide because it included Mexico on the cover. I am doing a road trip through Central America in May. Regretably there is only one page covering all of Mexico. Way to vague to be any use for me.
3,Coming to America,"Delaney Westmoreland is looking for a little rest and relaxation. As a graduation present from medical school her cousin offers her the use of his cabin in the woods of North Carolina. To Delaney this sounds perfect. She can rest up before starting her residency and have some time away from the Brothers 5 (Dare, Thorn, Stone, Chase and Storm) - her older, overbearing and overprotective brothers. She arrives at the cabin to find out she's not the only one looking for a little rest and relaxation. Jamal Ari Yasir, a sheikh and prince from the Middle East, has also been offered use of the cabin. With both refusing to leave - the sparks fly! Cute, quick, easy read."
3,Easily a 4 to 5 star book if it's longer,"I loved this book! The storyline was excellent with a strong, smart, beautiful woman in the lead, countered by a handsome sheikh! The buildup to Delaney and the Sheikh getting together was excruitiating, but worth the wait. My only complaint is that the book wasn't much longer. I wouldn't mind reading a sequel or two on those hunky brothers of Delaney's either! A quick but satisfying read."
5,;0),"Story: GOODIntimacy Level: GOODEnjoyment: VERY GOODI CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE giving this book less than 5 stars. Its really good and man o man o man, I read it and love it, you just have to read it, words can not express how good this book was as and well written and the family now that's a family I would love to call my own but mines are prefect the way they are.....Jamal and Delaney's story was pure pleasure to read. This book long ago introduced me to Brenda Jackson. This is only the beginning as the brothers and cousin's stories are just as good."
1,SILVER PLATED FLUTE BY SKY W/CASE AND BAG,"I ORDERED THE FLUTE FROM SKY WITH CASE AND BAG. I RECIEVED A DIFFERENTMODEL AND CASE WITHOUT BAG. I RETURNED ORDER AND AWAITED THE RIGHTFLUTE THAT I HAD ORDERED. TODAY I RECIEVED EXACTLY THE SAME MODELFLUTE THAT I RETURNED. HOW COME? I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THISTRANSACTION. NO FEEDBACK. SORRY I DON'T WISH TO TARNISH YOUR COMPANY.CONSIDER THIS TRANSACTION CLOSED. I'LL KEEP WHAT YOU SENT ME BUT I'AMNOT HAPPY. SINCERELY, RAYMOND E. DUNN"
5,Great Product,This is the best cordless phone set I have ever bought and at a great price. The audio quality is crystal clear and I found it very easy to learn how to use the menus. The only thing I did not like was the angle of the base when mounted on the wall but it is not a big deal it just makes me wonder what the designers are thinking about when they design a product. Overall I am very impressed with this product.
5,Like it so far...,"After having repeated bad experiences with the reliabilty of Panasonic appliances, I was reluctant to purchase another product from them. However, the combination of size, features and price and 15 years of boycotting their products, convinced me it was time to give them one more shot.So far, no problems. It was easy to set up and use. The basic features were easy enough to figure out without resorting to the manual, and the sound quality is good. The head set connector is the common mini pin type, so you can use your old headsets if you have them. Now that I have the two hand set model, I wish I bought the three set one instead, Can you add another hand set?"
4,No speed dial!,"Overall I like the phone but I find the lack of a speed dial feature curious. My last Panasonic cordless phone had it as does my cellphone but this phone does not. My 97 year old mother in law now has to learn to punch a few more buttons to call her sister and for her it's a big challenge. On the old phone, she just pushed one button, held it in, and the phone connected.Otherwise, it's a great phone!"
5,All In The Family is a classic!,"I love this show! Even though it was filmed in the 70's, there are still lessons that can be learned in today's times. Fantastic writers and cast!"
5,"I'M A BIG TIME ""ALL IN THE FAMILY"" FAN","I usually view DVD's before writing a customer review but i'm writing this one before this DVD is release because i'd seen every All In The Family ebisodes and I can safely say that there is no All In The Family series DVD's that is and will be publish that is not worth 5 stars. At least that's my point of veiw. I'm a big time ""All In The Family"" fan."
2,"big,biggest bigot!","I live in South Africa where the series appeared 20 years ago.Thanks to Amazon I was able to relive the wonder of Archie Bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family,each of whom is brilliantly cast.I have series 3&4 and now want 1&2.Don't wait any longer,24 episodes of absolute delight await you."
3,Christian the Lion DVD by HSV.,"I am reviewing the DVD by HSV (Hollywood Select Video). It is a decent enough attempt to put out a public domain copy of a 16mm film, but therein lies the problem. The PD version of this film is missing a few minutes. (Theofficial DVD titled Christian: The Lion at World's Endis complete.) Even the credits are not all there on the HSV DVD.Because of its source, the picture is a bit soft compared to the official DVD, as well.Heck, even the picture on the cover is just a generic lion picture; it's not Christian.Good enough to get by, but I don't really know why this DVD is around when theofficial DVDis available."
5,Amazing real footage,"After seeing excerpts on Youtube, I was intrigued. The video is worth every penny. What an amazing story of a lion cub raised by two men, who then introduce the young adult to the wild. I loved everything about this story!"
5,Christian the Lion-A great film!,"When I saw this dvd on Amazon.com I was very exited because I was having a hard time finding it. I knew it would be a great video, it really does show you the bond that can exist between animals and people. I would recommend this for anyone. It is a wonderful dvd for children, teaching how to respect and care for animals. It is also a wonderful experience for anyone who loves animals."
2,Very sad parts. Not great for children in my opinion.,"I saw the Christian the Lion trailer.It had tragedy and if you are an animallover, don't burn this into your heart and brain.If you don't mind crying your eyes out thenwatxch it. Would NOT recommend to have children seeit or they'll cry, too. You get very attached tosome of the other lions and there's alot of tragedy."
2,Tries to take on too much,"This title seems to be on every CMM person's shelf, based on title alone. However, covering up to level 5 in one book means that it is not a practical reference for a journey to any particular level. It seems to gloss over just about every topic, and fails to provide the level of detail to really be a useful guide. I have stopped using it at all as a reference."
3,SHE WOULD NOT LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT!!!,"A raped woman seeks revenge and combs the Asian jungle in search of her attackers. Believe it or not this stars Ms.Montgomery(the cheerleader from REVENGE OF THE NERDS) She still has that sexual prowess but now with Bowie knife and Grenades. Men cover your privates and be very,VERY nice to girls or Ms.Montgomery might be coming for you!"
2,Try to get an uncensored version,"As a ""Revenge of the Wronged Woman"" flick, this is OK. However, because it's been sanitized to protect us from anything that might be disturbing, including the pivotal rape scene, we never really feel the heroine's motivation. That means almost any other movie in this subgenre is going to be superior. My suggestion is to either find an uncut version or look for better fare."
1,Not worth it,"It's hard to read unless you have enough light, and even then there are times you cant read it. You have to reload everything every time you replace the batteries."
5,Worked great,product came quickly and worked well. Believe the instructions when it says use 500 lbs of cement. Had to go back to Lowes twice for cement.
1,99mg is not enough...,We're recommended to have 3-4000mg of Potassium a day. A banana has 300+mg. The pill is not even a drop in the bucket. Not worth taking in such a small quantity. Much better to just eat right.
1,Very complicated!,Very complicated.Not for beginners.Would benefit intermediate or advanced learners of the Irish Gaelic language.
2,Not even close to 5 stars,"Using this product, you can hear the words being spoken by native Irish speakers, and it does have some good language games (if you could type fadas that is).Things wrong with product. 1) You can't type fadas -- this makes much of the program worthless. 2) If you are just starting out you need learn a basic vocabulary. There are no flashcards or anything to help you learn that basic vocabulary. 3) Like most languages there are different forms of words depending on if they are a plural, if it is past tense, etc. e.g. mouse and mice, or was and were, or slow and slowly. Irish is even harder because the beginning of words change not just the endings, and this product doesn't tell you why, how, or when those changes occur.This program is not great, but you can learn some Irish words and phrases, and it's the only thing out there."
2,Kinda Cheap,"This costume is cute, but its a little cheap looking. The fabric looks a lot thinner than in the picture. The boots and mittens are wonderful."
4,great 1st halloween costume,this was our daughter's first halloween costume. She looked super cute as her brothers were firemen.4 of 5 because the little velcro dogbone collar doesn't stay attached
1,Nothing more than Windows 3.1 software with a flashy cover,"This package is available in a variety of languages, and all they do is take standard phrases and show you the translations and grammatical tense for each word. You could mass produce a hundred languages in this fashion. I speak Spanish fluently and found this method flat and insipid. Nothing is fun. There is no interactive dialogue, no games other than some silly fill in the blank sentences, and no building on previous lessons. Plus nothing is interrelated. If you see that a word is a singualar possesive you should be able to see the full conjugation and rules that apply. Not that hard with modern software. Nope, you click on a menu item called grammar and get a boring list of rules and you need to find the one that is related. This is just regurgetated Windows 3.1 software with a flashy cover. I was fooled."
1,Italian Now! 8.0 by Transparent Language NOT!,"While this program appears to be a great program, it actually is not user friendly. It does not include any instructions, other than how to install the discs. It does not tell you how to set up the microphone or how to use it (the program or the microphone). When I ordered this I was very excited by the description on the box, but I was at a lost on how to operate it. As a professional opera singer, I bought this software to increase my fluency in Italian. I am very computer literate and also have taken Italian classes in the past, but felt I wasted money on this program."
1,still non capisco l'italiano...,"....The software itself has not seen much action because everytime I try to use it, I get terribly bored. It is not too encompassing for a beginner. Perhaps with some knowledge of Italian the program would be of more use (?). The phrases that you begin with are not really relevant nor are they interesting and I find that I am still looking for that ""right"" software that will hold my hand through the basics."
2,Italian Now,This product is not for the beginner. It has very poor basic learning information and they refer you to an extremely boring text file to learn the basic. The instructions on how to use it well non existant!. You have to fumble around trying to use the product. They give no grammer skills at all. I would not recommend this product to anyone
2,ACK!! Wait that's German!,"This computer program looks as though some random guy just through a whole bunch of italian words on the software, got a woman's voice on there, added... fonts/sounds, and through in a box with a cover i am sure cost more than the program! Getting a book would be better, but I have to give some credit for the few vocab. words I have learned, otherwise, this program is put into two words!..."
1,Italian Now,"The version 8 is not supported for Windows Vista. So for me, it was worthless. I gave it to a friend."
4,back when short was funky,short dog's in the house good rapping funky bassline classic jamers brown scratch from my thang it's all good.
3,"Great club beats, incredible vocals, lacking in lyrics","As an avid Jennifer Holliday fan I was pleased to find she was vocally as talented as ever. She's lost nothing throughout the years. Musically, the club version is energizing! The other versions tend to be mundane. The lyrics are not pleasing or catchy."
1,Awful sponges,I hate these sponges - they are too rough to use like normal sponges. They do not hold water like other sponges - I am trying to get rid of them now - they scratch regular kitchen surfaces.
1,"what poetic, introspective, lyrics","i think a monkey could've come up wit the lyrics to this heap of dung. since i heard this crappy song, i have heard other pitbull records and some songs are ok. so, really, it's the song that i find crude, unoriginal song, which got played to death by all our local teenybopper, top 40 radio stations here in south florida. also, it uses a sample that was used by a girl group who's name i don't remember. that song was even worse than this one."
5,"Alternative healing for mental illness, without medication","This book opened a new life for us. A close relative has suffered two years with schizo affective illness (between schizophrenia and bipolar). He's tried medications that disabled his brain to such an extent he couldn't function creatively or even normally, hospitals that take all control from the ill individual, and psychiatrists who see you for 10 minutes and prescribe a new medication. He's now in a clinic that uses no medication, probing the emotional-spiritual crisis that brought on all these symptoms of mental illness. this book explains these two radically different ways of looking at mental illness and opens a path to real healing and a productive normal life. He's in charge of his life now because of Ty Colbert's insight into the ""wounded heart."" His brain isn't broken at all; he's beginning to understand the crisis that drove him. A ""10"" rating isn't high enough."
5,"""If he don't get you today,he'll get you tomorrow."".....""They call him slick.""",just got my copy today.....STELLARremastered quality......EXCEPTIONAL!A TRUE SOUL CLASSIC!
4,"FOR ME, THIS ALBUM MAKES THE MOVIE","i saw THE MACK. i just ask too many questions when it comes to blaxploitation films. i do dig the soundtrack. the only thing is though is that it is a bit too mellow for me. i like them raw and rough. however, on a boring day, i can put this on and it can be my lemonade vibe. willie hutch's music has that effect on me. sunshine in the shade.............................................................."
1,I would give this zero stars if possible...,"Earlier today I laid out a fairly flappy fart which had a really obnoxious smell to it, a touch of kimchee and poop. As soon as the noxious fumes hit my nostrils I immediately thought of this record, jennifer lopez's horrendous taste, and I realized that she'd made my list of 'celebrities that I hope catch avian flu' for their negative influence on popular American culture. Way to go J. Lo! Now 1 billion Chinese people think we're all crap."
2,Not such a great Album,"Jlo's albums have gotten worse with each release.This one is just awful.Thank god she decided to remix Get Right.The horns in the original was awful.No doubt it will be on the jukebox in hell.But Jlo's albums were always uneven.Shes a single and video artist.She is all image.The best track is ""Cherry Pie"" and i can only hope she releases it as her next single.Its the only thing that could possibly save this mess.Another track that is worth getting is ""(Can't Believe) This Is Me "".The others are painful to the ears with more than one listen.If this is how bad her music is getting,i hate to hear what her first spanish cd will sound like."
1,"Jennifer, This is BAD!","I don't know why I bought this album. It's not like Jennifer's music has been good to start with anyway. I'm not a big fan of the song ""Get Right,"" but I love the video, so I got the dual disc. And trust me, ""Get Right"" is the ONLY good song on the entire album! Jennifer is not the best singer. Just listening to each song was giving me a headache. Her voice is so bland, she sings so flat, and out of tuned. If you caught the 2005 Grammy's performance with her ""husband"" Mark Anthony, you know what I'm talking about.I can't believe Jennifer just sat back in the studio and said, ""Yeah, this album is TIGHT! Lets release it!"" Let me tell you something Jennifer, ""NO IT'S NOT!"" Maybe J. Lo should choose different music producers. Cuz this, this isn't cuttin' it!Don't waist your money on this. Unless you are a hardcore J. Lo fan."
5,The Best of Jennifer Lopez!!!,"This is a very good album for Jennifer Lopez. She's BACK!!! It's clear that like myself, other people are enjoying this album. You can tell that she worked very hard on this. I wish people would give her a chance and stop knocking her down at every opportunity. This is Jennifer's 4th album and she deserves to be where she's at."
1,Get Wrong,"According to her official websites. Song writers claimed her vocal is stronger than ever in this album. It's just a lie. Get Right is already a wrong demonstration. A high register she can't afford. Her weakness is totally shown. Due to a healthy digital sales, it can climb high on the Billboard Hot 100, radio-play chart is already a flop! The second single 'Hold You Down' is another failure number, not to mention other more horrible tracks in the album. This whole package is a trash. Plain tracks, stupid vocal, lyrics... the last two ballads are nightmare! And there are some stolen materials here (again). Thief! 'Rebirth' is even worse than 'This Is Me...Then'Please don't cheat us money. Your videos are hot, your movies are okay, but when it comes to music...byebye! If you want me to buy your cds again, do something like your debut please. That is where you came from, the ONLY place can get back your fame!"
1,QUÉ TE PASÓ JENNA?,"Me duele la cabeza cada vez que escucho esa torturadora trompetita de Get Right...Con esa muestra y con esa pequeñita voz en el desastroso dúo junto a Marc Anthony (él sí que canta!) en el show de los Grammys, no tengo mucho interés en saber cómo es el resto del disco. Qué pena!"
1,Don't even get me started,"Funny, not one star have I seen put out three albums, using absoultely no talent (no writing, no producing), have loads of filler movies, have albums rated below average everywhere with very medicore vocals, and still come out with a platinum selling. How do you do it J. Lo? How?The answer is obvivous. If you don't know, here are some hints: chest, bra, pants, sex. Get it? Her body. Now, I'm not just blaming J. Lo, as loads of other people have done this, but none have been successful. If I had J. Lo's phone #, e-mail, or whatever, I would ask her. She'd probably say something like ""What do you mean you don't like me? My albums have had enormous popularity on MTV. If you don't like me, I suggest you buy a ton of your favorite artist's albums, because I'm always gonna get a #1 on peak on the Billboard Hot 200."".Don't let her get away with it. Buy something else, like maybe Christina Milian."
5,AMAZING!!!rebirth indeed!!!!!,"jennifer really did it this time, after an ok cd (this is me...then) camen REBIRTH and it soounds amazing, all the songs are great!! I love I GOT U, STEP INTO MY WORLD AND HE'LL BE BACK they are all great songs, and this album is just playing AMAZING!!!!!"
1,J LO blahh blahh blahh,This is the worst CD I ever bought.I only bought it for one song and well thats all I pretty much got.I turned around and sold it back to Poco's so they could try and re-sell it used (once). What a waste of money. Blahhh
1,Talking or Singing?,"It took me up to this album to realize that JLO is actually talking instead of singing. I've realize that she sound like she is complaining and whining while she's trying to sing these songs. There is no emph in this album anywhere. She keeps going back to the ""hood"".I really belive its Karma whos knocked at JLo's door for stealing other artist music. IE Usher and Mariah. Remember JLo, what goes around come around, and now its your turn. Bitter!"
3,Is it just me- or is her cover picture kind of freakish?,"Of course most people know when you buy a Jennifer Lopez album, you don't buy it for her great range and vocal expertise. You buy it because her voice is pretty (when she doesn't try to belt a ballad), and her dance and hip-hop songs kick ass. Rebirth does not exactly deliver. Sure, Get Right is incredibly danceable and origional, and a couple other songs don't disappoint (Hold You Down, Cherry Pie and Still Around), but the edge of J. Lo seems to be missing. Its like she took all the fillers from her first three albums and stuck them on Rebirth. I mean come on, Step into My World? As song number 2? Jenny, at least put it as number nine or ten where it won't get that much play. The same goes for Whatever You Want to Do, I Got U and He'll Be Back.Someday, she'll make a Greatest Hits album- and THAT will be awesome. My advice, wait around for that."
3,Good try,"I haven't been a huge fan of J.Lo, but I do enjoy some of her hits like ""Waiting for tonight"", ""Jenny From The Block"", and ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"".""Get Right"" is very catchy IMO, along with a great video. While I thought she is back on track, it is rather disappointing after you heard the rest of the album.You simply don't know what she is trying to offer here. What's new about herself? What about ""Rebirth""? It is the same J.Lo with the same tunes. The rest of the songs just don't have a melody that you can hook onto.I would suggest you to get the single and leave the rest of it. ""Cherry Pie"" and ""Still Around"" are not bad, some effort there. Do skip ""(Can't Believe) This Is Me"" however, her vocal in this song is just... a torture."
5,A Masterpiece on every level!!!!!!!!,".Lo u have done made an album that will be rembered for ages.This is the Best Female Album I have ever heard in my life.The production,vocals,lyrics make this a classic.The best songs on this are all of them I cant pick a favorite but if i did it would have to be ,""Whateva U Wanna Do-this song is blazing J I love the drums and the beat this song is crack. I love this album it's simply a suprise and I love suprises.U are Rebirthed J.Lo.Wacth out Amercia."
3,Could be better,"I wouldn't say Jennifer Lopez's fifth album ""Rebirth"" isn't a good album, but I was waiting for more. The first single ""Get Right"" is very poor, it didn't deserve to be the first single of this album. ""Hold You Down"" is terrible. The best songs are ""Cherry Pie"", ""He'll Be Back"" and ""I Got U"", but even these aren't excelent songs. I was very dissapointed on this."
4,Yes she is ALIVE!!!,"This Jennifer Lopez second best album (Love? being the first), she really sticks to that formula that made her famous: r&b, soul, hip hop; yet she incorporates a lot of funk which is new to her. Rebirth was criticized a lot saying that JLO does not sing... she may not have a soprano voice but she has a good singing voice. And Rebirth is catchier and with better hooks that her previous albums."
1,"To make this woman go away for good, here's what you do...",Don't see her movies;Don't buy her music;Don't buy her clothes;Don't buy her perfume.Pretend she is the plague and little miss sham will go away.
3,"Lets keep it real, this is J.Lo","Okay I like J. Lo, I don't worship her or hate her but I am an opened minded individual who likes some of her previous work but never listened to an entire album.In Rebirth JLo uses more instruments like horns and drums to pretty good effect. Her production is very good.. maybe just a tad overproduced but I'm not complaining.She still uses light R&B; jams to compliment her pitchy and light voice. But everyone knows JLo can't sing... time to move on and accept she is popular because she has great marketing and has a great sense of buisness and style.Favs: Cherry Pie, Hold you Down, and Ryde or Die.Jlo's Rebirth doesn't have the impact of Mariah's FABULOUS Emancipation of Mimi... it may be that J. Lo may actually have to delve into some of her past and pain and bring some more substanence to her killer horns and bass lines.This is pure pop-R&B; nothing less and you shouldn't expect more."
1,Oh My Goodness....1.5 Stars!,"First off..let me say..I am not a J-Lo hater, check my reviews and you will see, I don't often give bad reviews! But the bad reviews for this CD are true, so don't be fooled by the record company or gushing ""fan"" hype! J-Lo's voice is very weak and letting her sing tired, sub-par lyrics, even over solid, thumping beats makes it even more obvious! Jerkins and Timberland can't save her and I doubt The Neptunes (with all their dope beats) even could! And if some of the top producers in the industry can't breathe life into your flat vocals...then let it go...'cuz obviously you're dead in the water!One thankful thing though.....at least there's no sappy ""I'm in love"", "" I love you, Ben"" songs this time...'cuz it would only increase the pain! Unless you're a die-hard J-Lo fan, don't drop a dime on this because in my humble opinion, it isn't a rebirth, its a musical death knoll all dolled up in psuedo hip hop gear!"
1,"oh no, j no!!!!","I liked jennifer until she became too overrated, and let's not get started on her marriages. I thought she was a good dancer and did good movies such as Selena and the Wedding Planner, I enjoyed the singles from On the 6 and J LO very much with their catchy melodies and music and janet jackson-inspired music videos which fit well with the songs, but since then she's gone down musically and this album is no exception. I was feeling get right a lot cause it's much better than that 'jenny from the block' mess she put out but the rest of the album is anything but right. The songs are weak and there are no melodies or hooks that the first 2 albums had. Maybe she should just stick to acting and continue building her acting skills instead of putting out albums. I suggest releasing a greatest hits and focusing on her acting career instead, and maybe being a backup dancer too"
4,good cd,"This cd has much to be desired. It dosn't compare to her other album ""This Is Me . . .Then's"". I like her but it definately is not one of her best cd's. Of course she has her good songs, like both mix's of Get Right but she has many filler songs like Cherry Pie. I like this cd, it is a good cd but nothing more. It wont be played that much on the radio, so I would suggest to buy this cd, but don't expect the record of the year."
1,can any one say j lo bought her recording contract,i just dont know how stupid and moronic people are to buy this crud.i cant wait for when it comes out that jlo is just an untalented overhyped ego queen.you guys should give youre money to starving kids instead of buying this nonsense disguised as music.wake up
2,STILL BORNE...,"If this was a rebirth, i think it died upon coming out of the womb. This Cd is her worst ever. On the 6 was a nice debut especially because of the timing with the whole latin music explosion (at the time ricky martin, enrique iglesias and marc anthony all had hot pop albums). But now it's clear she should stick to acting. She's lucky usher threw away the GET RIGHT beat because it's the only radio friendly song she has. Her 2nd cd is still the best and that's not saying much although ""love don't cost a thing"" will forever be a pop classic. Alas, j-ho is still very reminiscent of a Janet Jackson with less talent (scary!!!!) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY go order a pizza instead."
5,Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!,"Jennifer Lopez is the greatest! ""Rebirth"" was a smash hit! J.Lo has:MoneyFameRespectA string of hit moviesA loving husbandCitical acclaimFans all over the worldA great bodySeriously, if you don't already have ""Rebirth,"" you deserve to be spanked."
3,"Good Songs, Bad Voice","I'm writing this review late because I've had the album for about a year and started playing the cd again. When I'm in the mood I will listen to this album all day everyday. I'm not a fan of J.Lo's voice, but the production of the songs and the lyrics make them stand out from her lack of vocal skills. My favorite songs on the album are Ryde for you, I Love, Get Right. Overall, the album is average."
3,Mariah overcomes you this time! THAT IT HAPPENS?,"I am super A Fan of Jennifer López, but unfortunately I defraud myself this time, the album was given to know with Get right which was an excellent song the same as other few of the Album, The Single Second Hold You Down is Boring, the letter is bad and in definitive I don't work you is in the #64 of the Billboard Hot 100, an artist always is not successful but the truth is that this album is bad, only for my pleasure 3 songs like Step into my World, Cherry Pie, Get Right and Ride Or Die, the rest is pure garbage, Luck for The next one this time the face of monkey of Mariah Carey I overcome you."
2,Big disappointment,"I love J-Lo - she is beautiful & can dance & even act, but this album is terrible. While I realize she cannot sing, her other albums have provided good beats; this album has nothing to offer other than 'get right', & 'ride or die.'"
1,Yikes,"Sorry but this album was doomed from the start...I mean her lead single was taken from Usher's trash can(sorry but that's why it received such minimal airplay folks), and Hold You Down is the worst song ever, with stupid rap lyrics by Fat Joe..c'mon people this cd is suck a joke, there will be no third single Sony says...ps. and Mariah had nothing to do with this, she's too busy with her own true hit album right now."
1,J.lo's album is a miess,"I am a music lover. I had high hopes of J.lo in her ""Rebirh"" album. I listened to it on MTV's the leak. J.lo's album is one of the worst I have ever heard. THe only midly good song is ""Get Right"", that gets boring after a few plays. She stole that track from Usher. She also used a Brandy track called ""Ryde or Die"", you can cleary hear brandy in the background vocals. The beats are subpar, and it feels to deliever good hooks and lyrics. I am sorry J.lo, but you get a 1 star."
5,Jennifer Got It going on!!!,"I'm Really Not a Big Fan Of J.lo But this Album is Off The Chain I Liked The Fist Single ""Get Right"" That Lead me too get the Album Didn't know how the record would sound...But it turned out to be amazing...I like He'll Be Back, Step In To My World...I got U...I,Love...I like The Whole Album If you like to sit at home and relax you need to pick up this album...plus it's some good fulfilling ballads here..."
1,AWFUL..,I agree with this....Don't see her movies;Don't buy her music;Don't buy her clothes;Don't buy her perfume.Pretend she is the plague and little miss sham will go away.
3,Not J Lo's best album,"I bought this album on iTunes and was dissapointed with J Lo. ""This Is Me...Then"" was probably her best album hands-down. ""J Lo"" comes in 2nd. I am a fan of miss Lopez and I think she can sing but she unfortunately wastes her voice on disposable tracks that aren't memorable. I loved ""Get Right"" and those horns that play in the background. ""Cherry Pie"" is also pretty catchy. I also like ""Step Into My World"" and ""Hold You Down"" featuring Fat Joe. Some of the songs on the album are just unlistenable. This was not much of a rebirth for J Lo. It pretty much kept to the same style of music as ""J Lo"" and ""On The 6."" Hopefully the next time she goes into the studio something better will come out. There are only a few listenable songs on the album and I hope J Lo releases a better album next time. Sorry but I give this a mixed review."
3,good effort from j lo,"I think rebirth is a misleading title cause the music isn't exactly innovative, but she did make an album that is listenable throughout. It may not be good as in her j-lo heyday, but it still works and is an improvement from this is me then. On some songs she is just hiding her voice through computerized vocals which makes it appear like she can't sing, but on other tracks she shows some signs of vocal improvement. I think she sings best in spanish just like in that marc anthony duet. The videos are real hot too, I hope Cherry Pie is the next single, I love the music but I hope she redoes the vocals for it."
2,Things that make you say HMMM,"I bought this album hoping she would finally get the hint that listeners want some jumpy, dance music, but was I ever wrong. She has 3 tracks on the cd that I enjoy, and using the word ""enjoy"" is pushing it. She needs to take her music to another level, and I am thinking after her last 2 cd's that level might be...stop singing."
2,rebirth of what? songs that suck as bad as the ones on Remix,"All I can say is I'm glad I paid no more than 3 dollars for this album. I have all of Jennifer Lopez's albums and most of her decent movies and videos. If you like Hip Hop, you will probably like this album, but I rather her pop and ballad style songs like on the ""J.Lo"", ""This is Me Then"", and most of ""On the 6."" The only songs I liked were ""Cherry Pie""- it has a very energetic upbeat style and (Can't Believe) This is Me, as it is done more in her previously mentioned style. ""Get Right"" is horribly sing-songy and will stick in your head more than ""It's a Small World"" and if you've been on that Disneyworld ride- you know exactly what I mean. And in case you didn't get enough of ""Get Right"" as the first song, it's also the last song on the album."
1,you sound like a dog jho,DUMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY who thought of the concept for this album who ever did they need to get donald trump up there and say your fired because this album sounds like a gay brintey spears cd you made me cry because your voice was just off track so i therw the cd away my mom got mad son i spent 1299 on acd that sounded like a sick dog everone who has these cd throw it away
2,a bit better than this is me but still not great,"Get Right was a great first single despite j lo's weak vocals, very catchy dance music! The rest of the album is not like that, Cherry Pie is the only other okay song, and even that has j lo's worst vocals, but good music. Well she tried to have a rebirth, but instead she gave birth to the end of her music career"
2,Just Dance J. Lo!,"Don't we all wish that J. Lo would let go of this silly singing obsession and just become a full time dancer? Her voice lacks depth and range. All of her fans must be tone deaf to think that she sounds good...anyone with any formal music/vocal training knows that singing out of your nose is not the way to go. Most people wonder why Jennifer survives in this industry...it's not about the music anymore, it's all about the drama, the look and the image. Jennifer used Diddy to get her new name ""J. Lo"" and try to earn some cool points with the hip hop community, but it didn't work. The only thing keepin' Jennifer whinning in your ear is that pretty smile and huge behind...but like Bel Biv Divoe said, ""never trust a big butt and a smile""...learn to hear the real from the fake."
1,rebirth? more like the death of her music career,"Get Right is the only okay song that is a party banger, the rest really sucks and has too much sampling and weak vocals. I don't understand why some people think mariah fans would bash j lo, I would think those fans have musical tastes of listening to talented people and not bothering with image artists like j lo."
1,this album flopped!!,"what was she thinking?this album sucks and whats up with that title ""rebirth"" rebirth from what?making money from not having any talent?cause honestly this woman has no singing talent what-so ever who told her she could sing whoever said that should be smacked!plus im sick of her and her name shes so overexposed this woman should stick to one, thing she cant do it all, my advice for her is to stick to acting even though she can barely do that"
1,Rebirth? Dont think so....,"J.Lo has one of those voices that you cant stand after a while. im guess she did this album for the sake of it, or to get more money, but it doesnt look like thats going to happen. the songs on this album are terrible, whether its the writers or the producers, but one thing for sure is, J.Lo just doesnt cut it. this album will drop off the charts in no time. rebirth? dont think so.."
1,Pee You,Hype Hop? This is purely the most overproduced product I have ever heard. Which is bigger her ego or her booty?
3,i do love the funky grooves on this album,the only problem is that j lo is singing it. But her producers are musical geniuses.
1,Garbage to the NTH Degree!!!!,This is straight up GARBAGE folks! I would give it 1/2 stars if I could. This chick is a hoax - her own family members wouldn't purchase this mockery of music! U r more than a fool if bought JENNY FROM THE CROCK on this project...
4,REBIRTH-J.LO IS BACK/POETIC AND SEXY,j.lo defitnetley suprised me on this album.she sung better/the beats are hotter/and the akbum is reall poetic and sexy.i defitnetley consider j.lo a Icon just like madonna and janet jackson she has accomplished many things and still going.this is worth your money.
1,BAD,What junk!!! Why did I buy this? It was horrible from beginning to end!!! No more music for J LO Please!!!! Hopefully I can get my money back.
1,ANyone,"anyone who wants this album please sample it before buying alot of people about this album she used a sample off ""As we lay "" By shirley . I hope she move up."
2,A Real Music Fan,"First, I'd like to say, this album only averages out to 3 and a half stars at the top because someone decided to post the same review over and over again about 70 times. With that being said, I'd just like to say how unbelievably formulaic this album is. Repetitive, annoying, and just flat and horrible vocals from J.Lo really hurt this albulm. The only thing that might be good on this albulm are several little beats, but these don't redeem this album fom being horrible."
1,J-lo returns....TO CRAP,"Don't waste your money. Same ol' lack of talent. and the person that is repeatedly posting the ""J-lo returns"" post needs to get A LIFEpretty pathetic"
1,"this album should be called ""Death""","It is AWEFUL!The only good song on this album is Cherry Pie...but Cherry pie is similar to Janet Jackson's ""Just A Little While""I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS ALBUM..."
2,Rebirth? More like DOA,"I remember Jennifer Lopez as an actress, specifically in Steven Soderbergh's ""Out of Sight"". When she's with the right director, Lopez is more than just a competent actress. When she's with the right music producer, Lopez's singing voice is merely acceptable. The songs on Rebirth know how to make the most of her limited vocal range and the sound is always sleek, bouncy, hip-hop flavored, ballad-ready, and R&B friendly; in other words there's a little something for everyone. Not that covering every possible market demographic is such a bad thing, but Lopez needs to be careful that she's not diluting her persona for the almighty buck. It seems that Rebirth does exactly that and though there are some pretty good tracks like ""Get Right"", ""Step into My World"" and ""Cherry Pie"", Rebirth for the most part is stillborn."
2,thank god for music 'cause she can not,"....sing. please jen,jlo,jenny o whatever stick with the food the booty shots anything but the singing. i wish i had listen to this before i purchased but i thought it had to be good..girlfriend got over ben got married doing things..not. dont but this listen to whatever they play on the radio if that happens."
5,J.Lo. At Her BEST!!!,"This is a very good album for Jennifer Lopez. I don't care what reviews the dumb staff at Amazon.com cares to spotlight because Jennifer Lopez is BACK!!! It's clear that like myself, other people are enjoying this album. You can tell that she worked very hard on this. I wish people would give her a chance and stop knocking her down at every opportunity. This is Jennifer's 4th album and she deserves to be where she's at."
3,Good Comeback,"I honestly think that this album shows people exactly how people can change over time. I have been a Jennifer Lopez fan since Money Train, but when she started making cds, it was over, I have purchased all of her cds, and i love all of them. Not only does the album have great producers, she is a great songwriter. The album is okay, not a good as the others, but if u listen, and give it a chance it will influence you. If you are a real J.Lo fan, u will appreciate the album. Give it some time, it will appeal to the fans, somewhat."
1,LACK OF MUSIC....LACK OF TALENT,rebirth of what? please tell me ..rebirth of THE same old jenny with a collection of fillers ..this album has nothing but fillers.. why should someone have to spend their money to buy this collection of fillers. she must understand something that many young talented people who believes in their music alone were emerging and the taste of people have improved and they are quite sensible before spending their money on something like this ..she did quite well in J.LO ok and thats it ..her carrer is virtually lost after jlo and after that she is suffering a terrible lack of talent .. just belly dance videos alone won't promote an album.
3,Not that good,The good:Get RightStep Into My WorldCherry PieI Got URyde Or DieThe bad:The rest (especially Hold U Down)I expected better Jennifer.
3,OK 3 and 1/2 possibly 4 stars,"Jenny has been a fav. of mine for quite some time, as a prof DJ the croud poolside at The Worthington in Ft Lauderdale LOVE her, as well as her first Single remixed via Louis Vega ""Get Right"" from ""Re-Birth, (PS why so shoty just under 6min) But I honestly must say this CD will take time to really appreciate it, there are some really great potentials for great club mixes, however I really wish Jen. would return to her roots, and have a major come back from the remix likes of Hex Hector or Chris Cox (of Thunderpuss fame). I hope that she devotes time to this Cd, as much as she is with her numerous projects including marriage, cosmetic line, and clothing. Hopefully she will remember ""where she started"" and return, shocking us all, back into a new reformed MIZ. Anthony Jason33305@aol.com Jason Prof DJ"
3,Dull,"Jennifer Lopez is back with a new album REBIRTH. The title is misleading...since it's not what it implies at all. I don't know why but after a few listens I found myself bored already with the album. The first single ""Get Right"" is a catchy number that was a good choice for first single. ""Step Into My World"" is a nice midtempo track that should do well if released. ""I Got U"", and ""Ryde Or Die"" are great as well 9even though the latter sounds exactly like Brandy, not surprising considering it's an outtake from Brandy's AFRODISIAC album). The rest of the album falls into ok...""Cherry Pie"", ""I, Love"" and ""He'll Be Back"" are ok but not too memorable. The worst offenders are ""(Cant Believe) This Is Me"" and the absolutely terrible ""Hold U Down"". Definately not her best, that honor goes to 2001's J LO."
4,PLEAZZ stop hating,"this j.lo album is hot,one of the first reviews on top ^ is soo stupid saying that hold you down is about chris judd when its about her friendship with fat joe (dumbasses i swear anyyyywayzzz ) dont sleep on this its hot and if u dont like this review dealll wit it HOLLA BACK *j.lo fan 4 life*"
1,Please Make It Stop!,"Man, can she get anymore stupid and talentless. She needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits. All the songs on this album are totally unlistenable! She completely lacks power, vocal range and versatility. Jennifer Lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today. She gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career. Just because your a great actor/actress doesn't necessarily mean you can sing, too. Some actors/actresses were able to achieve it, but not Jennifer Lopez. She needs to quit the music business while she still can. Please stick to acting...OH, WAIT! I forgot, she can't do that either!"
1,Pirated Music,"Now, everyone who has heard ""The Roof"" from Mariah's multi-platinum Butterfly album, have been taken by surprise. The official remix for Jennifer Lopez's song ""Hold you down"" sounds exactly like Mariah's 1997 hit. ""Hold You Down"" is using the same sample used on Mariah's song. ""The Roof"" contains a replay of ""Shook Ones"", which was written by A. Johnson and K. Muchita.In January, he listened to Lopez's ""new"" song ""Get Right"", which was exactly the same song he had recorded. According to Female First, Usher declared, ""I hate it, but I'd better get some of the publishing rights or else. I didn't put it on my album because I couldn't get it right. But I didn't expect J.Lo to just take it."" Usher and his producer, Rich Harrison, are still trying to find a solution to the issue.The funny story here is that Jennifer Lopez launched two songs in a row using ideas from two previously released songs - by other artists, of course."
3,what about the fans,"I am dissapointed with Rebirth. When is she ever going to give thanks and shout outs to her loyalfans? She wouldnt be where shes at if it wasnt for us,customersetc.I have all her music.Its ashame I would enjoy these cd'salot more if I knew I was being Thanked"
3,You people are dumb,"YOU PEOPLE ARE DUMB!YOU CAN GO TO MTV.com AND HEAR EVERY SONG FOR FREE!I LOVED GET RIGHT!I DON'T LIKE THE C.d MUCh.O.k i guessi shouldn't be so mean ,but it's true.THe only songs i like a lot are Get right and hold you down.I hate that J Lo wears so much fur."
1,Jennifer Lopez you cannot Sing!,"Give it up already, Jenny from the Block. You can't sing. And you don't even have passion for music. I do not hear the passion. What is your style? You are all over the place. You whatever hoping something catches on and then you'll make it yours.And am I the only one that thinks that pictures on the Rebirth cover look like a distorted fetus?JLo proves that men rule the world. If you are ""doable"" and desired in that way, then you are a millionaire many times over."
2,"NOT GOOD ENOUGH, JEN","The album is not good, but not bad at all. There are few tracks in this album worth listening such as ""Get Right"" and ""Hold You Down"", but the rest, just a filler."
2,Not Very Good,"On first listen, I thought the CD was decent....but the more I listened to the CD the more J Lo's voice disturbed me. Some of the beats are great, but when they are mixed with her voice it ruins the song! I love ""Get Right"" and the track right after that is ookk...but that's it."
1,"C'mon, JLo!","I was so dissapointed in this album! The only good song on this CD is Get Right, but other than that, don't even bother with it. I wish I hadn't bought it. I've seen better in the dumpster."
1,NO J.LO GO BACK TO MOVIES,"THESE ALBUM IS HORRIBLE.THERE IS ONE OK DANCE TRACK CALLED CHERRY PIE,BUT THATS IT.HOLD YOU DOWN IS A WANNABE ALL I HAVE.GET RIGHT IS A WANNABE CRAZY IN LOVE.J.LO I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU WERE THINKING BUT THENAGAIN U CANT SING."
5,The BEST Album of Jennifer Lopez !,"I love this album it's a CLASSIC!This tecnology DUALDISC is also the best right now, a CD and DVD in 1 Disc.THE DVD Features:-Rebirth album in Dolby Digital DVD Audio 5.1-Making the Album-Videos: Get Right, Get Right Remix Feat.Fabolous-Making The Video: Hold You Down Feat.Fat JoeI love all the songs, are great, the Timbaland's song ""HE'LL BE BACK"" gonna be a Hit, is R&B; like ""Cry Me A River"" of Justin Timberlake.Also love the 3rd single ""STEP INTO MY WORLD"" pruduced by Rodney Jerkins, it'a a hot single!Jennifer I'm soooooo proud of you baby !"
1,where are her musical skills,"she has good acting skills and dancing skills and good fashion taste, but that's where it ends. She's had catchy songs but no good voice. Release a greatest hits and continue your career with acting and dancing, maybe even on broadway, just like debbie gibson"
1,please dont buy this!!,the fact that she can be such a successful singer is beyondhas anyone even notice how bad her voice thisagain she has given us a horrid albumjus listening to the 2 lead singles 'get right' and 'hold u down' will give u an idea of how bad this album is.its basically lots of beats and production covering an essentially super weak voice.
3,Bland..something is missing!,"I COMPLETELY agree w/ ""Dr. Mo's"" review here...I am a Jen. Lopez fan, and I was completely psyched for her new album, and picked it up on the first day, due to ""Get Right"" (Which is the hottest song on the album)For some reason, her ""Rebirth"" seems to mean a loss of who she used to be. Her first album, and her second album even more (IMO) really shine. She has fire, spunk, and a bit of Puerto Rican flavor thrown in to the mix! (Ain't It Funny comes to mind and Let's Get Loud from ""On the 6"")I own all of J.Lo's albums, and many singles...but this album is a bit of a let down. It is missing something, and I can't put my finger on it! ""J.Lo"" (the album) is an album that you must own, every song is worthy of a listen. And, in addition ""On the 6"" is a great listen.."
5,Jennifer has changed for the better,Although she still has the catchy pop esque tracks like get right and cherry pie she has become more diverse with tracks like step into my world. A sort of middle eastern dance of the seven veils track by far my most fav track of the album. although apparently her range has increased she doesn't pull any long notes like celine but it's a great album anyways.
3,She's Back!,"Jennifer Lopez shines with ""Rebirth"". But why did she name it ""Rebirth""? To me, rebirth is supposed to be something new and unexpected. This is truly Jennifer inside and out. Nothing different at all. But still, a great album."
1,MAKE IT STOP!!!!,So glad I did not waste money on this...um Music. My boyfriend made a copy off the net so the only thing wasted was a $1.00 cd. As for the people who gave this garbage 4 stars I hate to see what other crap you have in your music libary.
1,"Actually no stars! Her worst yet, if that is possible.","Music is my passion, most all genres. Jennifer better hold on to Mark and hope that some of his talent for singing rubs off on her. I agree with a previous review. I, too, suffered through each song on her new album. Sadly there are no good songs. Perhaps when she left Ben she left what little singing talent she had, too. I suggest Jennifer kiss her singing career 'goodbye'."
1,ACTING LIKE SHE CAN SING,"This CD was the biggest waiste of time. Not one song on this album sounded like she even had control of her voice. It sucked. The lyrics were horrible to. She just repeated the same thing over and over without really any purpose to the song. JLO needs to stick to acting not ACTING LIKE SHE CAN SING. With the CD being titled REBIRTH you think that she would have had alot better songs but she didn't. Her title had nothing to do with her cd. It should have been called ""ALL READY DONE."" Cuz nothing on this album was new. Even the song with Fat Joe is so similar to the one she did with LL Cool J on ""This is me then."" I heard no vocal range on any tracks. Most of the time there was something else drowning out her voice. i.e. the horns and the background singers. JLO really needs to stick to acting and stop ACTING LIKE SHE IS A SINGER. Don't waiste your money on this poor quality CD."
2,Ugh. Horrific.,"I suffered through this CD twice just to give it a chance. The first song is ""ok"" and the pseudo-latin flavor is nice at times, but this is one bad CD, even for the clubs. She has such a horribly thin voice and the music isn't fun because it's too dumb for even that.I really don't like this CD; however, I can see with certain tastes that some folks might enjoy it for background music or just dancing. Don't expect to enjoy it too much if you're looking for anything artful, emotional, or beautiful because this CD is void of that."
2,Big Dissappointment but some good points,"Ok wow it's hard for me to find a CD I don't like but this I was hoping for a great comback CD from miss lopez but I get so off vocals and bad song writing yeah a few good songs that is it. STand out tracks are ""Get Right"", ""Hold You Down"", and ""Step into my World"" and those tracks arn't very great their the only songs on the album that I can bare to listen to.."
1,More than a Rebith...a Death,"Jenny has die as a singer...This cd is bad.Just GET RIGHT is good and maybe "" CHERRY PIE"", the rest is crap...Sorry Jenny, best luck next time. A big deception for me as a extreme fan of her."
1,STICK TO ACTING HONEY!,"The girl is a good actress, good dancer, good dresser. Her perfumes smell good, and her on ON THE 6 cd was pretty decent. BUT- her singing is okay; she can hold a tune, but there is no talent there."
3,an improvement,"after this is me I thought she was over cause that album really sucked but to my surprise her producers did a pretty good job on this CD. Though her voice is really really weak the beats are really hot, her dancing is great and put me in the mood to party with songs such as cherry pie, whatever you want to do and get right. These are surprisingly some of j lo's better songs to have come out since the J LO CD."
1,Someone Please Tell Her She Can't Sing!!,I can't believe she really does think she has musical talent. Someone tell her quick so she'll stop embarrasing herself and her family. Computer technology can only do so much for generating a fake voice just ask Britney and Ashanti. This cd was'nt worth the time or money I took to get it. So be warned.....
1,Let By Gones Be By Gones,"It's Over, Girl. Focus on something else. Like maybe being choregrapher, your Flyy Girl days were as good as it gets. So your next move after this Rebirth CD should be Refocus(but not musically. P.S. You disgraced Marc Anthony on the Grammy's, no pun intended. Your producing movies now so I see you took my candid advice. Good move Girl.Get Out Now!"
3,HAVE AN OPEN MIND!,"I'VE READ THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS REG. JENNIFER'S LATEST CD AND WHILE IT'S NAME DOESN'T LIVE UP TO IT'S TITLE I DO FIND THIS CD TO BE AN ENJOYABLE ONE! WHAT I DO FIND TO BE A SHAME IS THAT THE REMIX FEAT. FABOLOUS ISN'T THE VIDEO VERSION. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN AN XTRA BONUS. SONGS LIKE ""STEP INTO MY WORLD"", ""WHATEVER YOU WANT"", ""RIDE OR DIE"", ""I GOT YOU"" ARE CATCHY & I FEEL ARE THE BEST TRACKS ON THIS CD. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE EXPECTED ""REBIRTH"""" TO BE A CHANGE IN HER SOUND. PERSONALLY, I LIKE IT! I RESPECT OTHERS OPINIONS BUT I RAHTER LOOK AT MY GLASS HALF FULL RATHER THAN HALF EMPTY!"
2,Rebirth??? HAH!!!,Same Old Same Old Ho-Hum Yawn!!!!!! Isn't a rebirth supposed to mean a new fresh start?? Can there be any sound more irritating than the sound of that Kazoo or whatever it is that starts this CD off? OMG please destroy every copy of this thing before it grows. It is not worth the plastic it's recorded on.
1,this album sucks,oh my gosh..i am so glad i downloaded the songs online and listen to them before buying them......this album has the weakest vocals i ever heard....even paula abdul did better....ithink this ight be the end of her singing career..... she is only getting older and she cant dance like this forever and sing that bad on every album....she needs a lot oaf back vocals and loud back beats to cover up her no talent voice.......i recommend some one else that has a better album like Mariah Carey.....save your money ...cuz J-LO is not worth your hard-earned money.....
2,A Musical Failure,"I was really looking forward to Jennifer Lopez's fourth album.....being a fan of both her movies and her music, you can't even possibly imagine how disappointed I was when I first listened to ""Rebirth"". The entire album seems to be a cocophony of irritating sounds and unambitious lyrics....""Cherry Pie"" anyone??? Unlike her previous CD, ""This is Me...Then"", which initially I also didn't like but ultimately managed to tolerate - there is nothing on ""Rebirth"" that even remotely compares to the mediocrity of ""This is Me...Then""! What a disappointment....I'm giving this two stars only for the first three tracks, and as a J.Lo fan, out of respect for Mrs. Marc Anthony.... I have a feeling I'm not the only one disappointment....Better Luck next time Jennifer..."
1,THE BIRTH OF A WEAK ALBUM!,"What happened to Jennifer? This album is so weak compared to her previous offerings.The songs suck big time,including her collaboration with Fat Joe,""Hold You Down"",which is boring and so long. The only songs worth listening to are ""Get Right"",""Step Into My World"" and the remix of ""Get Right"",featuring Fabulous. The whole album sounds rushed and her thin vocals make listening to this album even more painful.The DVD which features the music video of ""Get Right"" and it's remix saves the album from becoming a disaster."
1,JLO Please Go Away,JLO's talents are mediocre in every sense of the word. She's sings but doesn't sing very well. She dances but doesn't dance all that proficiently. She acts but doesn't really put herself into any of her character. Plus I'm sick of her singing about every single one of her relationships in each CD.Singing is not her strong point. She really should give it up or either invest some of her millions into some hardcore singing lessons. I'd be happy to recommend some teachers to her.
1,spare us Please,"I believe that if J.Ho had recorded the song ""get right"" 30 years ago, the vietnamese would have used it as a form of torture against POW's. Not only can't J.Ho sing, but she also endorses the gruesome deaths of innocent animals for the sake of fashion, which makes her heartless and greedy. For more information check out Jlodown.com"
2,Totally boring but has some positive tracks,"""Rebirth"" was promoted so much to the extreme. I knew this was going to be the best J.Lo album ever! Boy was I wrong. This CD is totally full of garbage, bubblegum, Britney Spears reject songs. The horrible ""Cherry Pie"" is too happy and perky for me. The beat is horrible. The only songs worth listening to are ""Get Right,"" ""He'll Be Back,"" ""Step Into My World,"" and ""Ryde or Die"". The rest of the CD is bologna! She should stick to acting because her singing career is OVER! I would prefer ""Destiny Fulfilled,"" ""Concrete Rose,"" or ""Chain Letter"" instead of this garbage."
1,Very Bad!,"If I could give this album less than one star, I would! I don't understand how anyone can call anything on this album talent. The horns in Get Right are very painful after a few seconds. Jennifer sounds flat and off key in every song. Dance music is better for her. I don't know why she tries to do mid-tempo r&b. This style of music doesn't hide her voice the way dance music does. I do not recommend this album."
3,3.5 stars for this record,"J LO never had much of a voice though it worked with previous singles from the first 2 CD's she put out. This CD is an improvement from this is me then and flows much better as an album than the J LO cd though that doesn't necessarily mean the songs are much better. True the music is your average r&b/hip hop dance driven tracks, but I never thought J LO was a creative/innovative artist, I just thought she always had catchy dance music with nice videos to match the music, and great dance skills, ever since I saw the Selena film in fact. So take this for what it is and enjoy the music if you want to get your groove on and relax or jam to some r&b joints produced by rich harrison and so forth. The first 5 tracks are definitely my favourites on the CD and the rest isn't exactly filler though it's listenable."
3,Wasted Beats,"Man, they should of given these hot beats to someone who can sing. If Jennifer writes her own music she should just sell these songs to someone. SHE CANT SING!"
1,Rebirth: Regurgitate,"Seing has how her lead single ""Get Right"" is from is Usher's throwaway pile, and another attempt to steal someone else's music, it is no suprise to me that this album sounds as rushed and horrible to me."
2,NO NO NO NO NO!!!,"WTF WAS JENN THINKING WHEN SHE DID THIS ALBUM?I GOT THIS ALBUM BECAUSE MY GOD-BROTHER SAID IT WAS HOT. NEVER AGAIN WILL I TRUST HIS JUDGEMENT ON MUSIC BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING. JENN OUTTA GIVE EVERYBODY THEY'RE MONEY BACK FOR BUYING THIS. IT'S TERRIBLE! FOR THE RECORD, THIS ALBUM SHOULD'VE BEEN ABORTED.JENN, I LOVE YOU, BUT THIS ALBUM IS LIKE HOW I PLAY BASKETBALL... AND I CAN'T DRIBBLE. YA'LL DO THE MATH."
3,not as tragic as I thought,"about 5 of the songs are really good r&b/dance cuts, so what's the problem? That she can't sing that's what! Her dancing and acting are alright, and her songwriters are talented but she's just an industry puppet. With all that money she makes being talentless you'd think she'd have gotten some training"
1,J Lo's New Musical Genre: Horror Music,"Yikes! I listened to clips of all songs on Rebirth. She could ""aspire"" to be the Paula Abdul or John Travolta of the 21st century if only she could sing as ""well"" as either of them. Any comparisons to Madonna are silly. I'm no fan of Ms. Ciccone, but she at least demonstrated genuine pipes on the ""Evita"" soundtrack. Sadly, J Lo pioneers a new genre one can only label ""horror music."" Some parents play Mozart to babies in the womb, hoping they'll become geniuses. Any parent that wants the kid to turn out to be the next Mellissa Rivers will play J Lo. THE HORRORS!"
1,J.Lo Please try harder! Fans are here!,I was wrong at first to write that rude remark marathon of her album. It's good but needs a lot of work done on her vocals. She is good! I now realized from a certain point of view. I liked al of songs. None in particular and at last too! So guys don't mis-jugde this album OK? Listen further & you'll find out!
5,step into the world of Rebirth,"something new from jennifer. this c.d is something that is great to listen to even when it get's old jennifer has made a timless c.d with diffrent sound's and had an open mind to go for a higher notes, which makes the c.d lots of fun to listen to a must have c.d!!"
5,Rebirth : A Fine Definition of A Real Singing Legend,"""Rebirth"" Is Another fantastic album worth checking out. From spending a lot of ballads from ""This Is Me...Then"", Jen moves into the limelight to belt out funky beats, dance tracks and R&B; songs. The first track ""Get Right"" showcases Jen's soft but prominent voice; her vocal prowess does justice to the songs dancable stint.Also noteworthy singles are ""Step Into My World"", a seductive Arabic charmful dance, ""Whatever You Wanna Do"", a poppish dance track, ""Cherry Pie"", a pop rock that explores other Genre and a fresh outcome, ""I Got You"", a very good salsa song and ""Can't Believe This Is Me"", which is one of her most powerful tracks of all time.Jen's 5th flight has developed her talents as a singer and songwriter. Although she still has to polish her vocals more, Jen's effort to break free from her accustomed sound shows her interest to take her career in a full spin."
2,losin her style,"i was so dissapointed listenin to this album. im a very big jlo fan and after when get right came out, i knew i had to get this album..i have her 3 other albums and this is by far the worst album. my favorite song i like on this album is get right and hold u down is okay..the rest of the songs i couldnt even finish listenin to it cuz the sound sounded so bad..i wonder what her next hit will be..but yeah now im a bigger mariah fan than jlo after comparin their albums..i expected to hear a lil hip hop rnb pop sound but it was the opposite. she was trying something totally different and it didnt work out. and after her appearance on the ellen show she was wearin a trashy silver top and an ugly pink skirt and her hair was curly she looked so bad. and she cant act..every single movie that came, she always plays the same boring character like monster in law..im really gettin sick n tired of her. ugh"
2,Disappointed,"I really like Jennifer. She's a great actress, and performer. I'm glad that she has chosen to remain private about her life, which is hard to do in Hollywood right now.I own all of her other albums, and LOVE them. They are very well done, and she sounds great...what happened?!?I don't think she sounds wonderful at all on this record. Her voice is off, and many of her songs are sampled. We all know about Get Right and Ride.I know Jennifer fans will love it...but I didn't. Sorry Jen! :("
2,"After ""J.Lo"" everything went downhill","I like Jennifer Lopez, but her albums keep getting worse & worse!! ""Rebrith"" is another piece of garbage.Get Right: Usher, your song is missing.Step Into My World: Nothing Special.Hold You Down: Cute. Nothing more than cute.Whatever You Wanna Do: ""Get Right"" part 2.Cherry Pie: Sounds like a Whitesnake song.I Got U: Her voice sounds really bad.Still Around: Nothing Special.Ryde Or Die: Where's DMX? lolI,Love: ""Hold You Down"" part 2.He'll Be Back: Best song on the album.(Can't Believe)This Is Me: Can't pull off angry.Get Right: Okay remix.""Brave"" is worse than this!!"
1,J. No,"Let me start by saying that I am a Mariah fan, and it is natural for me to read reviews of her rival. I read a review from a J.Lo fan that referred to Mariah as Grandma Mariah. Hello? Jennifer's older. Grandma Mariah as opposed to great great Grandma Jennifer Lopez.Second, I listened to the Rebirth album in the record store. I'll never buy the CD for obvious reasons (read all reviews with 1 to 3 stars.) When I listened to it, I understood why peole were giving it less than stellar reviews.To summarize the album in a word: BLAND."
1,.....No Hip Hop Remix?,"""Get Right"" is horrible in its original form, but the Hip Hop Remix Mistermusicfan mentioned is addictive. Why the hell didn't they include it here? That remix could have been a smash hit, it has the same infectious sparkle as ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" and ""Waiting For Tonight."" But this album isnty that good. It is boring. Jennifer, it's time to make a greatest hits. but i want that remix!!!"
1,Disapointed J-Lo Fan,After listening to bits on Amazon I've decided not to buy this cd and if I do I'll buy it used or burn it from someone else. Not going to waste my money on this cd.
1,She's a has-been,"This broad is so ovah it isn't even funny anymore! She started out with a bright acting acreer ahead of her. Selena & Out of Sight were fantastic and even her first CD, On The 6, was spectacular.Then something went horribly wrong. She became a media ho.Next thing we know she is running from gun toting rappers and selling perfumes that smell like someone urinated a bottle of Cuervo Gold.Then she dated perpetual loser/has-been Ben Affleck and sand about still being ""from the block"" eventhough she has millions dollars and is better than those people.This CD is a mammoth failure both artistically and commercially. The girl is OVAH!"
1,This Girl Has Dirt for Brains and the rest is Silicon,"You were expecting anything but a pandering bit of fluff? This is a person who thinks wearing FUR from ANIMALS SKINNED ALIVE is glamorous and a good business to be in. Man, that is bad taste in the EXTREME. Idiot Jennifer is the GROSS creation of a bunch of creepy Hollywood executives who wear WAY too much cologne, sport chest hair and spend most of their time trying to seduce 12 year olds. Only a fool thinks this idiot is a musician. All of her films are really bad bombs too. Why spend money on this empty head when there are plenty of hard working musicians out there with something to say.In two months this CD will be selling used for 75 like the rest of her CDs.One star is one too many. ZERO stars. Negative stars."
2,just 2 songs,i only like two songs in this album- the first and the second track... then the album goes downhill from there. don't waste money!
1,Not A Singer At All,"Knowing that this is a Jennifer Lopez album, I didn't expect powerful vocals when I listened to it. True enough, the vocals were horriible, as most of the songs are. It was a waste of money and time.Sure, her video's hot but her song's not. When I want to see how hot Jennifer Lopez is, I use my eyes. I watch her videos and films. But when it comes to music, I use my ears, and this album failed in all auditory aspects.Sure she's not Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera, Norah Jones, or even Mariah Carey. But if she's in the music industry, she should be."
1,FUR HAG,"J-Low is a sick twisted fur hag that is ignorant to the animal abuse and torture that animals are subjected to just so she looks good. Wearing dead animals is not pretty, or sexy, it is just sick. Anyone who wears fur or supports the brutal fur industry is disgusting. J-Low, wake up. Animal cruelty is not in style, and animals are not around for you to wear. Educate yourself you stupid sick fur hag!!!"
1,Is this supposed to be a Rebirth?,"I tought the word rebirth meant, discarding all previous formulas but i gues that's not the case for JLo, this CD is the worst ever, forget the lack of vocal talent, the music sounds exactly the same or even worst than the previous cd's, a total trainwreck! Go with Emancipation of Mimi instead!"
2,Average but terrible for someone with so much experience,"Considering the fact that Jenifer Lopez has tried her hand at just about every aspect of the entertainment industry, it is shocking to discover how poor this collection of songs (what she considers an album)is.J-lo's third album ""This is me,then"", proved to be a little disappointing, but ""rebirth"" can be considered an insult to the music industry. And although she may follow the rules of any other pop-star, she falls flat on her back.Tracks like ""Step into my world"" prove themselves to be dull and unoriginal all at the same time, due to an extreme lack of melodies. Overall, the journey of the this atrocity can leave one pinching themselves, asking whether such a bad album could be made by such a reknown artist."
2,Not much REBIRTH on this album...,"Jennifers singles are those types of singles that you enjoy listening to on the radio...but would hate admitting it to friends that you like them. J Lo has had the problem of good singles but a lot of filler in her albums. The only tracks which show a different direction are GET RIGHT (Those horns are genius!...and the version with Fabolous is better), HOLD YOU DOWN (Good song for you and your boo) and STEP INTO MY WORLD (Very sexy and Middle Eastern feel to it). Unfortunately this album is not worth it...there are only two or three decent songs. So what else is new for J Lo albums?"
1,Are you kidding me!!!?????,"One word for this CD- HORRIBLE!!! I wanted to give it zero stars but amazon wouldn't let me. If you seriously think that this garbage sounds good, I don't know what to tell ya. J-LO cannot sing and this CD is a prime example of that. This might just be the absolute worst attempt at music I have ever heard in my life. I would rather listen to finger nails on a chalk board than this trash...in fact, that's where this CD belongs..with the rest of the trash. Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy REAL music (Gwen Stefani, Alicia Keys, Vanessa Carlton and on and on). Rebirth..yea right...try DEATH."
2,J.Lo a No No,"This album defenitly could have turned out above average if her voice wasn't that weak. I don't know why the best producers in the music industry give their music to ""singers"" with weak voices.I bought this album because of Get Right.I like that song a lot. I don't even listen to Jenny singing, I just listen to the beat. Other songs that make this a keeper are Step into My World,Whatever You Wanna Do,and Get Right feat. Fab. Once again, I only listen to the beat, not the singer."
5,Rebirth is Classic!!!!!!!!!,I love this album J.Lo albums keep gettin betta and betta and betta and this time it struc classic
1,www.jlodown.com,J.Lo doesn't even have any talent in the music industry!!! She can't even sing and she does more talking in her albums than singing her notes. She just wants to make MONEY!!!...Please visit www.jlodown.com
1,Blows,"This album sucks. Only 2 decent songs. Get Right is one of em. Its a good comedy album though, listening to her trying to reach those notes."
1,J Lo fails,"Jennifer Lopez had her 15 minutes of fame, now it is time to move on. this set of songs does not do it."
2,"To Mimi, From Jenny, With Love...","This album was clearly a gift from Jennifer to the infinitely more talented Mariah Carey. The feud is over between the two and J-Lo has finally come to the realization that she simply can't compete. The only thing worth enduring on this album is the first single, ""Get Right"" and its remix featuring Fabolous. To listen to each worthless filler in between would just be torture and is highly not recommended. After a disasterous 2004 Grammy Awards performance, you would think one would want to lay low for a while and give the rest of us time to forget how utterly awful your voice is, but not Mrs. Lopez-Anthony. Instead we are reminded for over an hour that this ""diva"" just can't sing. Save your money for a month and get emancipated when Mariah's album drops April 12th."
5,I Thought It Was ONe Of Her Best!,"I think that ""Rebirth"" is a classic! Its a different side for Jennifer, and I like it. I think to listen to this album, u would have to like different types of music. So, if you're the type of preson who listens to one thing, this album isnt made for u to listen to! LOL! But I think that it is a great album! The whole albums is just awesome! (But IM on my step moms account so! Her name is Amanda! My name is Jordan!! THANKS!! I hope this review will help some people!"
4,Good value,I received this item in great shape in a very timely manner. The combined disks and cases make this a very good value.
4,Best Overall History of the Berber People,"Doing a research paper on the Berbers in Libya, I ordered several source books. This was the best of them. An easy read following the basic chronology of Berber history and addicting contextual materialThe historical story kind of peters out with the Ottomans. It is strongest in the Phoenician through Arab periods, which are probably the most important, but there is nothing in the book about the 20th century history."
3,Informative,This work provides an overview of the Berbers as an ethnic group. The book is informative but unfortunately for me had nothing on the one Berber group in which I am doing research. I am keeping it as reference material.
1,No Seal - avoid,It has been very frustrating trying to get the lids to seal.The edges of the container and the surface of the lid seal must be immaculately clean to have any hope of holding vacuum.The valve inside the lid cannot be accessed for cleaning - if itgets any contaminant in it forget sealing with that lid.1 of the lid valves leaked right out of the box.Holding the adapter on to the lid while pushing on the power button on the sealer is akward.The Food Saver canister is a much better design - the valve is easy to clean and the vacuum hose snaps into the lid so there is no akward adapter to hold.The only customer service is an obscure PO Box in Texas.
1,"Sealed, but wouldn't stay sealed","I purchased these canisters for my seal-a-meal. At first, it seemed like they worked great. When the unit was done, there was no way that lid was coming off the canister. However, three days later (and no one had touched the canister) the seal was ""broken."" I thougt maybe user error, so I tried again several times using all three canisters. Same results. I checked with my sister and found out she had the same experience, so they were returned today. The sealer with the bags works great, but these canisters are pretty much useless. Forget Rival customer service. When I called for suggestions on what I might be doing wrong, they read directly from their website and told me that was the only information they had access to."
4,"A little finicky, but overall good product","I use these with my Tilia brand FoodSaver. I agree that these canisters aren't as user friendly as the FoodSaver brand, but I've used them for several years without problems.Pros: I like the square shape for storing loaves of bread. The tall one will almost fit 1 full loaf.Cons: The lids are a little finicky compared to the FoodSaver canisters (probably due to the shape).Tip to get them to seal correctly: Make sure you leave an inch or two of head room. When mine doesn't hold the seal, I always find it's because I have too much in the canister."
3,another nice mesh,this is another nice mesh for lupe fiasco after his great SUPERSTAR. this time he has the great jill scott singing on this track. parts of this song were featured on a nice a t and t commercial on tv with flower phones sprouting out of flowers. the rhymes are a bit weak and the two ''b side'' songs are not as great as lupe's other songs but i'm glad i have this cd single.
3,when legends die sutdy guide,i thought it was useful. it cleary explained the main concepts of the book When legends die
3,knit beanie,The hat looks exactly like the picture. It doesn't stretch very much and is too small for my liking. I would not recommend it for people with thick hair.
2,Great price but NOT what i expected,"This review applies to all 2(x)ist Men's Jeans. While the color is great, the fabric is cheap and VERY thin. I bought 4 of these jeans and dont even wear them b/c the material is very thin. Im afraid if i move to fast i might rip the jeans right at the seams. I dont recommend these jeans."
4,"good fit, not durable","The feel, both of the cloth (lighter than most jeans), and the fit, is nice. However, the it started getting ragged around the edges after the first wash. At $18, it was definitely worth it. At MSRP, no way."
3,NOT about haunted Houses!!!,"BEWARE! This is about being a GEEK, not designing, setting up, or haunting a house. If you want to stick needles through your skin, get this book. If you want to build a headless statue or some other haunted house prop (like ME) then DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It's fine for what it is; title should be: ""dress up and do creepy tricks"" not how to haunt a house."
4,How to Haunt a House for holloween,Great ideas to make your own Haunted Houses. I used ideas from this book for my own haunted house. We really scared people I doing it again this year.
4,Dreamlnad Satan's Tail,"I enjoyed this novel. One of his better recent novels. Satan's tail was fast moving, with some interesting twists to the middle east problem. The cast of Characters is good but can overwhelm the reader at times. Dale has always been great at introducing new Technological innovations, but this time he has outdone himself."
4,Another god Dale Brown book,"As others have said, drifting away from the old dog series but it is a good read. Has an interesting story line but does get disjointed at times. If you are reading multiple books or or returning to the book after a break you may find you have to back up a bit to refresh your memory.Always fun reading Dale's books"
4,GOOOOL,"Yeeeaaaa, this book rocks, the ending of a series, the solution to MACKS PARALETIC CONDITION the ultimate ender. The ender of all enders. Brown and Defilice create a hook that has the best bait I have ever encountered.1 million billion pros, wont even list any of em theres so many, but there is 1 con, this is the last of the series, so there is no follow-up, as far as I can see, oh welll..."
2,This is by far the worst book I've read all year,"The only real action occured in the last 50 pages, and the story line was so confusing and disjointed that I had to resort to making notes to keep tract of all the characters and the goofy technical terminology. Sometimes the characters are referred to by their first name and sometimes by their last.....very confusing. The book reads as if it was a first attempt at writing a war novel by an author.I read a lot of books and this is the first book that I have ever felt strongly enough about to write a review.I doubt that I will be buying any more ""Dreamland"" series books.Once again.......for me it was a terrible read."
1,omg Is Britney Spears STILL Trying to Sing,"I thought the gods were going to bless us when I heard that Spears was going to retire. Well, remaking one oldie and then releasing her ""Greatest Hits"" isn't exactly staying in the spotlight (Thank God). Always mediocre, Spears realized the limits of her, uh, gifts.....then paraded them on stage and at every sleazy award program. Spears and her pal Madonna should retire their G-strings and stay out of sight. Madonna, the middle-aged old broad and Spears...aging quickly to catch up......have single-handedly brought the music industry down many notches."
1,No Sale,"When I ""heard"" that this CD was available I thought, ""great stocking stuffer for my young daughter!"" I went to purchase the cd at Target....well sorry, ain't happenin'!WHY oh W-H-Y would they ruin an otherwise decent CD by making the cover trashy? NOT something I would allow my daughter to have!And just WHO is she trying to appeal to?? The 5-12 year old girls who are her largest fan base?I think her sales will suffer for her going by the way of Christina Aguilera.....cheap. It's a shame really.THIS mom will go and download the preferred songs off of an MP3 site (legal of course) and make my daughter a decent CD.I hope Mandy Moore continues to be a better musical artist by taking the high road and keeping her clothes on."
2,OLD!!,"OK, Let's be honest here people, Nobody likes Britney Spears anymore.She used to be this American female popstar in her early 20's and now she's a retired housewive mommy in her mid to late 30's.I like Hiilary Duff and she's kinda becoming the new Britney Spears.I sorta did like Britney Spears when I was about 6 or 7 but now she's old.But her younger sister Jamie Lynn is still good.Jamie Lynn is the star of a show on my favorite TV network Nickoleden ""Zoey 101"" so Jamie's still got it but Britney has lost it.Any of the following if you like Britney Spears:5 years old.Does bellydancing.Where's black shinny goucho pants."
1,American Life by Madonna-awesome album,"American life is filled with guitar ballads and dance/pop tracks that get political and personal and is simply the best album ever of madonna's career, and much more serious than little girlies trying to be ""punk rawk"" and changing their hair colour thinking they're making a statement and not being able to sing. Madonna is a better choice, buy american life at a music store near you"
3,HORRIBLE COVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh please, put some clothes on, bee-yotch!!! If Britney wanted to do a remake of an 80's song, why choose that one? It is so closely associated with Bobby Brown that I doubt that anyone else could have a hit with it. And does she ALWAYS have to look like a hooker? But the music is what counts. The ""new songs"" offer nothing ""new"" at all. ""Do Something"" sounds like an ""In the Zone"" out take as does ""I've Just Begun..."". And to me it just shows how much better her first two albums were. Even pop music haters have to agree that ""OOps"" and ""Baby Hit Me..."" are classic pop songs. They also have great album cuts such as ""Born To Make You Happy"" and ""Can't Make You Love Me"". But this does have a decent bonus cd of remixes so it may be worth your money."
2,The Greatest Hits....,"I am a fan of Britney Spears, but her recent single ""My Prerogative"" turned me off. Since I am a fan, I really tried to make something that would like the song, but sorry to say, I really don't like the song. I think Britney made a wrong move in releasing that song ""My Prerogative."" In addition, she tends to be rebellious, and honestly, I think I am seeing different Britney now - she was lovable before but it's different these days. Two stars for her, because of the DVD. It must be one star."
5,Britney Has Done It Again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I picked up her Greatest Hits album today. And Man It's awesome!!!!!!!! This is a must have for Britney fans. It's awesome. It includes 21 tracks and a bonus disc with 5 remixes on it. Hehe I wont tell you what the remixes are cuz you need 2 buy it urself!!! PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!-HUGEBritneyFan
1,"wow, how is she considered an icon?",Her music is horrible manufactured bubblegum. There isn't a SINGLE SONG from this PIECE OF DISPOSABLE DUNG WORTH LISTENING TO ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!!
2,i just don't get it. why do these record companys always fail to make these greatest hits albums complete. every single time?,"for the first disc(the actual album itself)it is missing four songs: born to make you happy, from the bottom of my broken heart, don't let me be the last to know, & i love rock & roll. and the second disk(the remixes)coming in at under a half an hour, more could of been added(i'm a slave 4 you, & stronger remixes just to name a few)and maybe some more b-sides and rarites. to full up the disc. right?. all in all a missed opportunity to make your GH's set into somthing that would of been nothin short of spectacular and a way for fans to remember you. if this set was complete(which it is'nt)fans would say(shes the best, this is the best, and i just got my money's worth). way to go spears & jive records, & all you record companys, for screwing up. again."
5,A Must Have For All Fans,"I love this collection. The album includes all her hits from 1998 to 2004. All the songs are great and I love it. This is definately a must have for all fans. Those people who hate her should stay away because this CD is made for the fans, not for you!"
3,It's okay,"I like some of Britney's music, most of the new stuff I actually enjoy. But the problem with any artist releasing a greatest hits album so early in their career is that a lot of the songs really aren't hits. Songs like ""Overprotected"", ""Outrageous"", and ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" really should not be included on the disc.But there are some real good songs included. ""Toxic"", ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", ""Everytime"" and ""... Baby One More Time"" are all great songs and merit the right to be here.As for the new stuff, I must be one of those weirdos that actually likes ""My Prerogative."" I think it's a pretty hot track. ""Do Somethin'"" is tolerable but pretty annoying and her voice is the most computer generated you've ever heard. ""I've Just Begun"" is better but neither of the songs should have been included on a collection like this.Strongest Tracks: ""Toxic"", ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", ""Me Against The Music"", ""Everytime"", ""Baby One More Time"", ""Crazy"", ""Boys"""
5,Finally...,"like her or hate her, Britney has rocked the music biz for the past 6 years, and (yes I know) has done so by showing a lot of skin. The music is good, and that's all that matters. If you don't like her, you shouldn't waste your precious time on a cause you find unworthy.... it seems as though you're contradicting yourself by putting in so much effort to such a simple thing as an online review. Anyway, this is my ""two cents worth"". Perceive it as you may...."
4,I enjoyed listening to about half of the songs on this CD,"When Britney came out in 1999 with the album Baby One More Time, she was a breath of fresh air with her catchy dance tunes like Baby One More Time, You Drive Me Crazy, and Sometimes. Her followup CD included hits like Oops I did it again, Lucky and Stronger.Britney has had fewer hit songs since her second album in my opinion. I really like the song Boys from the Austin Powers soundtrack and the autobiographical song I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman.All of Britney's older songs are excellent and they are included on this CD. However, I think some of these songs are too recent to be considered on a greatest hits album like Toxic and her duet with Madonna Me Against the World. My Prerogative is not very good. I had a hard time understanding the words to her newer songs to be honest. I enjoyed listening to about half of the tracks on this CD."
4,Great Collection of Britney Spears' Hits,"This is the ultimate collection, the only thing a Britney fan needs (along with the Greatest Hits dvd). It contains some of her earlier hits (...'Baby One more Time', 'Stronger', etc.), her more recent hits ('My Prerogative' being released for the first time and also 'Toxic', 'Me Against the Music' with Madonna, etc.) and two new songs including Do Somethin'. I would consider every song on the album a hit single. However, I wish that 'Someday', her newest single, had been recorded in time to be in the collection. Overall, a great collection of hit pop songs you'll enjoy!"
2,Your Legs?,"Why the hell did you get your legs airbrushed on the cover photo? I like the fact that you are getting a little chunky. You do not have sticks for legs, like the photo showed. You liar.The music - who cares. It is all about the image. How far do you think that she would get on American Idol? Ashlee Simpson? Lindsay Lohan?? Vanilla IceGood lord I hate these people."
1,....Just Read The Review,"Wow, Britney Spears has released a Greatest Hits Album. I'm a huge Britney fan. I have all of her CD's...except this one. Why would I buy her GH CD when I can put together this CD at home? Sure the DVD is an incentive but that's the only reason why I may purchase this CD. The new tracks are available for download and would be cheaper if you just bought the tracks. This is the first time that I refused to rate a Britney album and I pray it will be the last."
5,Awesome,"I don't know why people are saying such hurtfull things about britney. It must make them feel better or whatever. She has great music, she is sexy and she is only human. why are people calling her slutty. she works hard for her body so why not show it off. mabey people are just jeolous. I mean you may say bad things about her but your boyfriend wants her and you could only wish to look like her. I love all britneys songs and she is so awesome."
3,Not the best compilation from pop's biggest icon,"I think Britney Spears has been the biggest, most influential pop artist of the last decade. She totally changed the pop music scene around the world, and can already be compared to lifetime divas like Madonna. It was about time she released her first greatest hits compilation, but ""Greatest Hits: My Prerogative"" is definitely not the best she could have done. She only has 4 albums out, and for that reason, I expected ALL of her singles to be included here. ""Born To Make You Happy"", ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"", ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" and ""I Love Rock 'N' Roll"" should have been included by default. On the other hand, I don't know why ""Outrageous"" was put in here...the video was never even released, and the song never became a single. Finally, why release a cover song as the lead single for a greatest hits album, and worse of all, title the CD that way? ""My prerogative"" is Bobby Brown's greatest hit, not Britney's."
2,aight,"I'll give Britney Spears dap for a 2-3 cuts that I have liked by Her. but let me tell you it ain't because of Her Voice it has all to do with the Production of the cut.She is the Modern Day Era of what a Studio can generate&what a Label can put out here. I ain't madd at her at all.I respect Her Hustle,but lets be real there ain't much there in terms of Music vibe.every era has a Britney type of Artist that catches on&oh well they have a few decent cuts but that doesn't make a Greatest hits."
1,Disposable Pop Trash,"Honestly the only good tracks are Toxic & I'm a Slave 4U. The rest is junk. To have a greatest hits this early in the game is ridiculuous. That's why ""greatest"" cannot apply, also for the fact that the songs stink. To compare her to Madonna is even worse. The problem with Britney is that she a manufactured paper doll. She's cute, but her vocal are severely weak. Like Janet Jackson, she mumbles most of her lyrics and is extremely nasal. It's hard to see any sincerity in her music since most of it is written and produced by factories.As much as I love Madonna's music, she does not make the weak ""Me Against the Music"" any better. Making alliance with this girl can only hurt Madonna's career.Maybe the greatest hits package is the final chapter in her less than impressive ""career"". Let's hope she makes a better mother than a singer."
1,whoa,"brittney needs to put on some clothes in the first place. No, i'm not jealous of her, so don't think that i envy her. Her main sellers are girls. No straight girl wants to see brittney concealed by only a bra and undies. What a role model!! As far as her music, it sucks, not to mention all of her music is computer generated, along with her voice. Obviouly modest is a foreign word to brittney. No wonder why many teenage girls are walking around like they are worth $5.00. What happened to the 50's and 60's modesty? It is a shame that people have become primitave in their clothing again, wanting only to parade around in next to nothing."
1,"Yes, she did it again","She keeps releasing music. It keeps disappointing those of us with hearing. It's even worse when you realize it's a marketing strategy that appeals to younger singers who actually do have real talent.High living and over exposure has done Britney in. Of course she never really had talent. Now she's just worse than annoying because she always sought the limelight but just spends all of ""My Prerogative"" grousing about it. What a cheap hypocrite."
3,She's Not Too Bad....,"I don't care too much for how Britney Spears behaves, but why criticize her when its been going on for years? You think she's a slut and dresses skanky? I tell ya, I think George Michael with Wham! in their video ""Wake Me Up Before You Go"" was just as bad. I mean, George Micheal with his short shorts was scary. Anyways, my point is, I like her music, not her. Besides, its her life. As for the CD, all the songs are good, but where was ""Don't Let me be the last to know"" and ""From the bottom of my broken heart""? I thought those were some really good hits."
1,"If she was fat, would you still isten to the music?","if she was fat and ugly and played the same music, would you listen to it? most likely, no."
5,Great buy,"This album is fantastic! it's full of catchy pop songs with great hooks. What more could you want? the new songs on the CD are produced by Bloodshy & avant, who bring a distinct edginess to the table and are the people responsible for the brilliant track that is ""Toxic."" A lot of the other tracks are produced by Max Martin, who is a musical genius and brought out the best in Britney. Hopefully she'll do a couple of tracks with him on her next album. the whole thing comes together beautifully and the end result is a superb collection of pop songs. be sure to check out the bonus CD that comes with it too, particularly the ""Outrageous"" mix. Also recommended is the DVD that is sold separately. The entire package is a fantastic career retrospective of someone who has accomplished so much, yet is just beginning!"
5,Limited Edition is so much better than the original!,"I love this version because it comes with a bonus CD with 5 remixes. Also, I really love the packaging on this version. It matches my DVD!"
1,Worthless,"I really don't like her and she has an very weak voice. Not strong and she can't hit those high notes at all. She's not pretty because all that heavy make-up makes her hot. The songs are weak and nothing you haven't heard 10,000 times before. Nothing new and just old boring bubblegum pop."
1,Um why does the title say something different????,"OKay, Im kinda pissed. the title of this page said i was going to get the britney cd along with a DVD...i have the email and everything saying thats what i ordered...Where the f*** is the DVD?! Thats the only reason why i pre-ordered it online instead of going to the store and getting it for the same price only 8 days sooner!"
1,This does not deserve any stars,It is a cruel joke to call these collection of lousy songs as greatest hits.If her best songs sound as bad as this I shudder to think how awful her other songs would sound.please stay away from this piece of S**T.signed Brandon taylor
4,What'd you expect it would be?,"To everyone who is complaining about Britney's record label putting out a greatest hits CD: Dont buy it. I figure, for the 10 dollars I paid for it, I got exactly what I wanted. I'm not exactly the biggest Britney fan in the world and I know she certainly isnt the greatest singer out there, but this CD is perfect for the ""not really a britney fan."" its got all her fun early stuff, her dance-inspired later music, and its all together. I'd much rather put money down to have all her hits on one CD than shelling out money for four different ones and have to sit through hours of filler music and sappy ballads.Also, I love the bonus CD with the remixes of Toxic, Outrageous, etc. I can't get the ""breathe on me"" remix out of my head, which is a good thing. Personally I've been listening to this CD more than the main one. I couldn't give this album 5 stars b/c some of the songs are kind of cheesy and Britney's voice just sounds over processed, but as a whole its definately fun."
1,God Awful,Pap like this should be used to fuel fires in refugee camps rather than being sold to poor western children who are indoctrinated by the Media into buying this cr4p.
2,"hated by many, loved by some","You get a bonus star Britney!!!!!Normally I give singers who don't write lyrics one star, but toxic is one of the best radio hits of the decade -- bonus star!! Its seriously creative and catchy material - and if Britney wasn't so unintelligent i'd say that she sounds cleverly sarcastic on the song (wonder who wrote it).Britney is obviously a girl that most people, with good reason, want to fall flat on her face. So has it happened yet? Sort of. Its too easy to hate on her now. Its almost lost its fun. And thats really the most unfortunate aspect of all this."
4,Pop music at its best,"For pure classic pop music, you can't go wrong with Britney. Since 1999, Britney has put out a number of memorable pop singles. Last year's 'Toxic' was her pinnacle and I don't know if she will be able to top that one. She certainly doesn't with her latest single, her cover of Bobby Brown's 'My Perogative', which lacks any real joy. It's rather dull and Britney sounds so serious, that it's only a lost cause. But there are plenty of hits here: 'I'm a Slave 4 U', '...Oops, I Did It Again', 'Boys', 'Lucky' and '...Baby One More Time'. There is also a bonus CD featuring remixes and a megamix. This is definitely a great party record. Britney may not be a great singer, and she is no Madonna either, but give her credit, she and her producers have made some great ear candy. This album makes a strong case for that."
1,A PITY ZERO STARS AINT AN OPTION,"iT IS AN ABSOLUTE SHAME TO CALL THIS STINKER AS GREATEST HITS.Britney is arguably the worst singer of all time as she blatantly lip synchs,chain smokes and is an awful role model.retarded songs like boys and toxic make me sick and want to run and play my LED ZEPPELIN CD'S.DONT BUY OR LISTEN TO THIS TRASH.ZERO STARS."
5,One of the best CD's you will ever buy,"Tracklisting1. My Prerogative2. Toxic3. I'm A Slave 4 U4. Oops!...I Did It Again5. Me Against The Music6. Stronger7. Everytime8. ...Baby One More Time9. (You Drive Me) Crazy10. Boys11. Sometimes12. Overprotected13. Lucky14. Outrageous15. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman16. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)17. Do Somethin'This album is great from listening to on long road trips, on your headphones, or just chillin'. A true collection of some of the best chart hit's of the last 5 years."
1,I'm scared to hear the worst hits!,"All I can say is ""wow."" I suppose that with a body like her's you don't need a good singing voice. Do not purchase this album."
1,A greatest hits after only 3 albums??,"I didnt listen to the cd and i dont plan on doing it any time soon. This just isnt right, how can anyone release a Best oF cd after only 3 albums(very short albums too). This CD probably has 90% of her songs. This is such a ripoff and britney spears is not an artist. of course her fans will absolutly love this cd"
1,Mrs. Federline,"Oh goodness. I do not like Britney..um...Federline. I don't like her voice. I don't like her music. And I do not like her...everything. She is pretty but that's mostly because of makeup and touchups here and there. She's Fake. But hey, good for her that she's happy, that she's pregnant, and that she has has some crappy reality show. Just as long as she stops singing for a while...I'm alright."
2,¿Greatest hits?.... f*ck...,"I do not think britney is prepared for a greatest htis, this album does not make any sense. My prerogative is cheap, boring, i just begun (having my fun) it(she) is silly, more of the same thing, though do somethin ' it's entertained, but britney continues sounding like a electrical robot ."
1,The End of the So-Called Pop Princess,"Thank God that Britney spears has finally ended, this album is a big disaster, she has zero talent, zero dancing skills and every song is so stupid and preposterous it makes me sick, she is done my friends, Because Christina Aguilera will take over in 2005-06 and she will become the new ""in"" thing.Britney will be forgotten just like limp bizkit and G-Unit in a few years, while Mariah, Geto Boys, Christina, Nas will still live onOne of the worst albums of the year."
1,corporate crap,"If you all buy into this garbage than you need to listen to some artists with talent. Try Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Live, Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins, STP, guns n roses. They all are so much better than this crap MTV feeds you!!"
1,2 bad 0 stars isnt an option,"wow wth...who listens 2 this excuse 4 music. i am a metal head & people call my music noise? spears music takes very lil skill/talent 2 make, produce, market, & sell. its just plain horrible & a disgrace 2 the musical world. i am so glad my sis is over this crappy phase. but hey i guess if u like wasting $ go 4 it. haha sorry fans, give me all the crap u want 4 this, i deserve it, ull soon understand wut im talking about tho"
3,Good set with a few flaws,"Although I disagree with some people that this CD had to be titled ""greatest hits"", it's a pretty good compilation. Basically, the singles are all my favorites. Even the new tracks with ""My Prerogative"" and ""Do Something"" among them. The only problem that I have with this disc is that either some past released singles aren't featured, such as ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"" and ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know""(which were two of my favorite Britney ballads), along with tracks that are featured, but got a dissatisfied extreme makeover(i.e.:""Boys"" and ""Overprotected""). The folks @ Jive Records should've compiled this CD the same way they've compiled her video collection on the DVD(yes, I have that, too). But overall, the disc is pretty good if you're still a fan of Britney's past work."
2,das hot,"Great compilation prize of her old baroque tunes mixed with her sassy harmony stylings (only paralleled by C-Pimp and J-Biz). Manheim Steamroller once wrote, ""B Spears is like the most doughy thing since sliced bread."" I concur! Track 7 made my knees quake with emotional vibrations (high energy love oscillations, neo-Muon style). If you want powerful BGVs and sensual leads, look further. Spears lays down beats like a mahogany drum, and im caught in her voodoo trance.On the down side, the real down side that is. this is not family appropriate, on a scale of 1 to raunchy, i give it a 7.5 raunchquake. Word, though. She puts out on this new cut. Her neoprene background riffs lifted me out of cold depression. Buy it!"
5,LUV IT!!!,I'm a huge fan Of Britney and I love this Cd!! It has all her hits plus three new fab tracks!! A must for FANS!!
4,All The Britney You'll Ever Need,"Listen, I know Britney Spears ""sucks"". She's not a great artist, or even a great performer/entertainer. I also know this CD probably marks the end of her career - I find it hard to believe she'll ever be able to make a comeback if she really is taking a couple years off.However, I'm a sucker for great pop songs and that's what these are. You're buying this CD to listen to Max Martin, the Neptunes and Mutt Lange work their radio-friendly magic. Catchy, infectuous, fun. All the great Brit-Pop without the album fillers.If that's what you want (like I did), you won't be disappointed. Although I admit - it's hard to look cool to the record store clerk while buying this CD. Thank goodness Amazon maintains my privacy so no one need ever know my guility pleasure."
1,She's not as talented as Madonna,"That's probably the most painful statement I can make about any female on the planet. No problems going to war on words here, her records don't sell so she's fading faster than her clothes. And yeah, I'm soooooo jealous."
4,Ahh... OK...,"Actually I want to give 3.5 star, but for bonus, Ok, 4 stars.Some musics aren't good, but most of all, it's good. I like some of her songs. Is this a really greatest hit from Britney? I don't think so... But, because there's Madonna inside, it's good.Top five music (for me):- Me Against The Music - It's Really perfect! A extra point because of Madonna. Point 9.9.- Overprotected - It's Very good. Extra point for your voice I... need... time...blablabla. I just love it! Point 9.7.- Lucky - It's like telling a story. Point 9.5.- Outrageous - I like the part in the minutes 2:00. Point 9.4.- Boys ( Co-ed Remix) - The Collaboration with Pharrel William is very good. Point 9.4note: Britney, your picture in the cover didn't look very good, you looked few years older... :)"
1,No...,"No, just no. People call Britney a ""pop artist"". This is not pop. This is over-comercialized bubble gum, electronic, computer-stimulated TRASH. You wanna listen to some real pop? Listen to Michelle Branch or Vanessa Carlton.I admit, these songs are pretty catchy. They make you want to get up and dance. But the lyrics are disguisting and meaningless. Shes singing the word ""sex"" over and over again to appear more grown up or sexy or whatever. Well, look how she ended up. Pregnant with twins.please, don't buy this. Her vocals are flat and boring and the same for each song. Check out Vanessa Carlton or Michelle Branch or Kelly Clarkson if you want pop. Check out Avril Lavigne or Skye Sweetnam if you want rock/soft rock. Anything but this."
5,A Milestone For The Greatest Artist Of All Time!!,"No matter what the haters say, Britney IS the best singer out today. Her songs, preformances, and career are absolutly AMAZING! She is one of the most talked about celebrities in the world. I hate that she is leaving for a couple of years, but people have to realize that she is a flesh and blood human being just like us. She deserves a break. In the past six years, she has changed the face of music as we know it. Being that she is only 23 years-old and has been in the music business for only six years, it is astounding that she has a greatest hits album! I look forward to the new Britney in a couple of years. ""Greatest Hits: My Prerogative"" is a true testament of what a great artist she really is. Contrary to what people think, she will be back and better than ever!"
1,Bubble gum doesn't last long,"The problem with Pop music, especially bubble gum pop like Spears, is that after one of her hits gets played a million time on the radio and the simple catchy melody that gets stuck in your head finally fades away, its not something you really want to hear again. In other words, music like this has no lasting power, and even if you liked it when it came out, it is already worn and out dated by now - so why try to buy it all again in a greatests hits collection? Not all Pop is thisephemeral, Michael Jackson and Madonna have been able to generate lasting pop songs, but Britney doesn't have the same weight and her songs lose flavor quickly, as does bubble gum after you chew on it for ten minutes or more."
1,THIS is music?,"it's really pathetic that a half naked white trash [...] with no talent/bad voice has gotten this famous. it's all packaging and PR. they should have stopped her when she was pretending to sing at disneyworld. i can't believe this is being pushed as the best music around right now - what a sad time. she and others like her are making music go downhill fast - if you can call what they do ""music"". i for sure wouldn't want my kids to grow up listening to this - i'll be proud to show them the real thing, everywhere from jazz and blues to classic rock. i only gave this garbage 1 star because they wouldn't let me select zero."
4,"Love Her or Hate Her, Britney Made Some Good Songs","*sigh* What can I say about Miss Spears that hasn't been said? Well, we all know she is not a great vocal talent, but I can't knock her off too hard. I admire her for taking risks and trying new things and this is what her greatest hits cd shows. In past reviews, I have been hard on Britney's past efforts (even though I liked her ""In The Zone"" cd). But as I was driving in my car, listening to this cd I had to admit that her music made me sing and tap my feet. If anything, Britney smartly surrounded herself with amazing producers who knew how to work her voice with their sounds and they did a great job and she did a great job with the presentation of it. Even though I think a greatest hits cd from Britney is premature, I hope she uses her time off to GROW as an artist. Take some voice lessons and learn how to play an instrument. If she doesn't, its the end of her career."
5,excellent album,"THIS STUFF KICKS ASS.ALL 17 SONGS ON THIS ARE GREAT,ESPECIALLY OF COURSE THE HIT MY PREROGATIVE,THAT SONG REALLY KICKS BUTT.THE OTHER 16 SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ALSO ARE GOOD CHOICES,OF A HOT LOOKING SINGER,WITH A GREAT BODY,AND A GRAT SINGING VOICE.I HOPE YOUR BREAK DON'T LAST LONG,SO I COULD HEAR SOME MORE HOT MUSIC FROM YOU."
4,All the hits,"Well, here's all the britt hits for the fans! I'm not a big b.s. fan but to all y'all who r this is good."
1,terrible,Everyone knows who Britney Spears is. I think more for the tabloid obsessions. All tracks are well produced but too many sound too similar. Proof positive that Britney is merely a manufactured product who has no writing talent or vocal talent.Songs such as toxic sound painful to the ears and for those who need proof - check out her live concert. I saw this on TV and there is no doubt that she cant sing to save her life.This album is not consistant and has many weak tracks. The rishi rich remix is a pathetic blast at bhangra and sounds like a cheap remix knocked off in one day.Dont waste your money on this record
3,Britney Hits!,"Isn't it too early for Britney Spears to have a greatest hits collection? I guess once you have enough hits to fill a CD then you are entitled to one, and here she does. This collections includes al the hits from ""...Baby One More Time"" to the Bobby Brown cover ""My Prerogative,"" which doesn't sound all that bad. The play list is shrewdly not chronological, which would make the record sound tumultuous on hits. Basically, now all you have to do is get this and never mind the other fluffers. It is weird that the faux-conservative girl from Louisiana, who got famous singing ""Sometimes"" on a beach, would later release ""Toxic."" However, all of us caught ourselves humming to a Britney song before. So succumb to the catchiness and admire it as kitsch."
1,Hopefully the last chapter of a dreadful story,"I shall waste no words on this puppet. All I want to say isIt's a sad state of affairs when this person and the others from the same litter steal radio/TV time & sales that should go to infinitely more deserving {read: ""re4al & outstanding""} artists like Rufus Wainwright."
3,Does Britney Bare Her Soul - Yes and No,"I actually bought two Britney greatest hits albums. I've been wanting a change up of vocal style for awhile and felt that was achieved in Toxic. Me Against the Music (Madonna), Stronger and Outrageous are also stand out performances. On the flip side, the remake of My Perogative is simply awful. It would have been better served with Bobby Brown making a guest appearance (of course, between court appearances). Also, the new song Do Something was easy to forget. The song that I want to hurl across the room and smash into a million pieces is I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet a Woman. Was the purchase worth it? Yes - because I liked at least 1/3 of the 17 tracks."
2,Britney Spears,"I personally cannot say I'm a true Britney Spears fan. Every now and then, I'll be surprised with a good song, but it's definately not because of her voice, more because of the beats. The only recent song I have liked by her was ""Toxic,"" and that, like I said, was because of the beats. It's a great dance song. But then you hear a song like ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" and ""Lucky"" and it makes you want to gag. With that Alvin and the Chipmunks thing she calls a voice, it is enough to make you wonder why she became famous in the first place. She is definately not a good role model, much less a good singer, and not an impressive dancer at that. On this album, there are only a few songs I like personally, and they are mainly upbeat songs, like ""Overprotected,"" ""(You Drive Me) Crazy,"" and ""Toxic,"" but other than that, this album is nothing to brag about. However, any true Britney fan will be satisfied."
5,Britney Spears' Prerogative.,"All the tracks in this album are great. I can't say that enough times, but I ADORE Britney's version of Bobby Brown's ""My Prerogative""!!! For starters, it is empowering to hear A WOMAN sing a song like this. It makes me feel that there's nothing men can do that we can't do also. This is MY personal anthem. My Prerogative. Thank you, Ms. Spears for re-releasing this song.Do Something - Great song!I've Just Begun having my Fun - Why didn't this track get released earlier?GREAT ""HITS"" ALBUM!!"
3,One last ditch effort,"Why would anyone, anywhere, cover a Bobby Brown song and then use the title of that song as the title of their 'greatest hits' CD? How many of these songs were even hits anyway? And what is with that cover? Yes Britney needs her image and The Corporation realizes that a sexy/sleazy cover photo will get a few more sales.Britney started off as another pop star, made it too big, then became a joke. I'm sure her record company is writing her off and want one last trip to the well. Might as well squeeze their golden goose one more time before she's a total washout. 'Greatest Hits' CDs are released for two purposes, to make money for the Corporation and to release an artist from their contracts. Guess they figure an aging, married pop icon is ready for pasture.But don't worry, I'm sure we'll all see Britney from time to time on VH1's ""Where are they Now?"""
3,HOW OLD IS BRIT?!?,"This album, being britney's 5th, is ok. It is a greatest hits album, which is cool, but I think her fans want to hear some new stuff, eben though they all still love her old stuff too. Also i think she needs to stop acting as if she's still 17, she's married now and has a kid, so start dressing and acting your age! Don't get me wrong I love her music and it makes me want to get up out of my seat and dance, but this 24 year old woman needs to start growing up. She could wear a little bit more clothes and people will still think she's ""sexy"" and she could stop getting on tv and telling the whole world that she's no longer a virgin and that her and kevin ""do it 3 times a day!"" No one wants to hear that, thats her private business!! Anyway, the CD is ok, it is missing some hit songs but has most of the godd ones, but britney, GROW UP!!!"
1,You're kidding me....right?,"A greatest hits album from Britney Spears? What's next, a Kanye West anthology? A Christina Aguilera box-set? The current state of pop music frightens me horribly.See, the phrase ""greatest hits"" connotes something redeeming about one's songs. Spears' ""songs"" are hardly the ""greatest"" of anything, much less redeeming. In fact, much of it (if not all of it) is utterly unlistenable, appealing to the lowest common denominator who hasn't a critical ear and will passively accept the crap MTV and the FM radio shoves them.But one things for certain: Britney looks fine in that cover picture. Then again, this doesn't help when bombarded by the atrocious beats and sonic hell of her ""music."" Ergo, if you're thinking of purchasing this disc, read my type....WAKE UP AND SNAP OUT OF IT!!!!"
3,Listen to the lyrics in Britney Spears' music,"I think it is a wonder that these songs were ever played on the radio. I also think that people wanted a new, young singer and they eagerly chose Britney Spears. After listening to this collection of songs, I am not sure what to do with this music. Not all female stars are dejected because they do not have boyfriends. In addition, girls should not want to be slaves to boys, and girls should not want toxic boyfriends. I think that more and more listeners need to pay attention to the lyrics in the songs, especially songs played on the radio."
1,britney who???,"When Britney Spear's first album came out called Oops! I Did It Again, I thought she had talent. But when My Perogative came out, I'm like, ""Where she at? That's sooo NOT BRITNEY SPEARS!!"" I couldn't believe it!! And her music videos from the CD, uggh!! I want da REAL Britney back!!!"
1,"bye bye fake diva, welcome back real divas","get madonna's confessions on a dancefloor November 2005, mariah's emancipation of mimi November 2005, toni's libra which is now available and also look out for the next janet jackson(the real queen of pop britney stole from) album. These are real divas with talent and soul, something britney will never have."
3,"Britney, Britney, Britney","This IS her Greatest Hits....Aside from not including Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know and Born To Make You Happy it does include all of her hits (good and bad). Plus the new songs: My Prerogative (I like the original better) & Do Somethin' which I really like. That song just sounds so different from her other stuff. I was more excited to get the bonus CD which advertised on the cover: Unreleased remixes....With the exception of 1 remix (Breathe On Me) that is an out & out lie. I either have the other remixes or I have heard them. So, I was quite disappointed in that. If you have all of her CD's, I wouldn't bother. The art work is pretty weak as well. But if you are a die hard fan than I think you will be really satisfied!"
1,"Actually, I wanted to give it no stars...","there should be a way to do that. I have a better voice than Britney Spears. While I'm on the subject, I have a better voice than Ashlee Simpson and that Lindsay Lohan too. But I digress-this woman's success is grossly out of proportion to her talent. Her voice is annoying and nasal. Yeah, she has a nice body, but so do many other people. Now, Beyonce-she can sing. That woman from Mazzy Star can sing. Tori Amos. Joan Armatrading. There's a long list of good musicians worthy of your ear. You don't have to buy this crap. Just say ""no."""
5,PERFECT!!!,"BRITNEY SPEARS PROVES ONCE AGAIN WHY SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, THE MOST TALENTED, AND THE MOST POPULAR FEMALE ARTIST IN THE WORLD!!!"
4,"Good Collection of Hit's!, But","I like but the promotion song My Prerogative is too boring anything compared with what she accustoms to make, also good lacks songs one that I like too much Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is very good, it should have put Overprotected in the original version the one that put it is bad, of rest I find excellent."
1,0 stars,"Incredible, she's re defined the word musician. To a lot of stupid people, which are growing fewer and fewer, this is considered something special. :) In my opinion this is something so ridiculous it should be illegal. This is almost worse than rap. People listening to rich un talented losers like her and rappers with fake little drum machines and billion dollar microphones.And as for the music itself, personally i prefer the barny theme song...."
4,Slave 4 Britney,"We've read the magazines, seen the photos of her at McDonald's, watched her marry her low-rent hubby. Somewhere, we lost the music. We forgot Britney's a performer, while she was becoming a tabloid queen. Hopefully this album will change that. I think ""The Singles"" would've been a better name for this collection, as we've only spent five years with Mrs. Federline. This album is a great dance album, all the songs you love, and three new tracks that show the promise of a great entertainer's future. I really like the bonus remix CD and hope that Jive gets its act together and puts out a full remix CD. As for retirement, don't worry guys, Britney will get her rest, and she'll come back BIG!"
1,Anyone else only see 4 hits?,"I must say I find it rather pitiful artists claiming to be releasing a greatest hits record when they don't even have enough to fill 1/2 a cd. Given ""...Baby One More Time"",""Oops!...I Did It Again"",""I'm A Slave 4 U"" & ""Toxic"" were actual hits, where's the rest? I'll tell you where. NO WHERE! Those are her only true hits. Yes, she had some success with ""Sometimes"",""Crazy"",""Lucky"", & ""Me Against The Music"",but the hardly qualify as ""Greatest Hits"". So fine if you want to count them, so that's 8 songs, yet I still see 7 tracks that aren't even remotely 'hits'. These record execs are so dang money hungry, it's ridiculous. Don't waste your hard earned money people. If you want her hits it would take less than 15 minutes to download all four of them ;). I won't even go into her voice or lack there of. Go buy Megan Slankard's ""A Freak Little Story"" or Brandy's ""Afrodisiac"" or something good like that if you want your money to go to good use."
1,AWFUL AWFUL AAAAAWWWWWWWFFFFFUUUULLLL,"Britney Spears is an awful singer! She can't hit any notes, maybe two. Her concerts are fake too. I can't stand her! The only song I like is ""Everytime"". Oh, and this CD is not by Britney Spears, it's by the Apple Computer Company, because she uses computers for almost all of her voice, lol, what a fake. Just as bad as Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan. The earlier reviewer must be a kid, just because your songs are big doesn't mean your music is good!!! Avoid this!!!"
1,Most Overrated Singer,"Britney Spears has got to be the worlds most overrated singer ever. Her vocals are average and nothing special or ""ear catching."" Her songs are just your average overproduced bubblegum poppers with her voice being computerized and other effects. And come on, for crying out loud, with lyrics like ""Outrageous, my shopping spree, my sex drive..., it shows that the vaults are getting a little dry."

1,total load of crap,If you buy this cd you might as well not consider yourself a music fan. It is complete garbage. I dont own it and neither should anyone.
1,I can't understand...,"I can't understand why so many people like Britney.We can't love her for her songs, she doesn't write them, we can't love her for the way she sings, she never sings.Maybe she can dance, but what does it have to do with music?I would have more respect for Britney and her albums if she was involved in her music.But she just sings songs that other people have written for her and she never sings in live, everybody could do that."
1,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!?!?!?,"how can you people possibly like this crap? Its overproduced, cliched and unoriginal. She doesn't write, produce, or even sing. Shes an insult to all musicians, such as myself. It falls right in with everything that is wrong with pop culture. MTV and radio make me cry. There is good modern music out there that you can buy, like the new interpol cd. Or you can get some old stuff from zep or floyd, but dont spend your money on this crappy cd. And age isn't any excuse. I'm thirteen, but i dont listen to this stuff. I think you guys should all get a tool or AFI cd and call it a day."
1,Can't Sing,She was cute and a novelty when she was young. But Britney has aged very fast. Her lack of a real singing voice has been apparent for some years now. Like Britney Spears could even come close to Bobby Brown's rendition of My Prerogative. If it weren't for tech/synch/amps and a great band she wouldn't be able to eek out the alphabet.
4,Greatest Hits !!!,"Wow this album is worth buying!! But im pretty sure it won't be a big seller tho. I don't think she has don enough songs to release this album. I think she should have added 2 other hits, ""FROM THE BATTOM OF MY BROKEN HEART""and ""DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW"""
5,britney spears is great,her greatest hits album is awesome i wouldnt change a thing it was worth my money and my time in the store to stand in line and but it . it sold out fast . so please respect her she is only human she will make mistakes dont we all. think about how people would judge you if you were her and how it would make you feelshe is my idol . for life from rebecca nc
2,Not good enough,"Crashes regularly on Windows 2000. Does not have a module with the sounds of the alphabet, which makes it hard to get started. Overall, just lacks organization.It will probably turn out to be a good supplement to another program, but by itself, is not enough to get started learning Russian."
5,DL the king of jazzy hip hop,this is one out of all of Funky's masterpieces he puts his life and his soul in his lyrics and you will love this album and if your new to jazzy hip hop this is a great album and look for the 4th quarter by funky dl that ti me is his best work. :+)
3,Large Baby Spoons Is All,I feel for this one. To me all They are just long handled baby spoons...Well see tonight just what kind of ice cream spoon this is suppose to be. I will post tomorrow my findings..
4,Awesomness,"This book took me by surprise on the first page, I didn't think I would like it but then I wasn't able to put it down. From reading this book I have learned loads of insightful information about myself. Not just that I learned what other women go thought and noticed that some of the problems are much my own. Rita Gorman may have written this book, but but I find myself living it everyday as I'm sure all women are."
4,Cleans Absolutely Great..if your back can handle it.,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this machine. It lives up to my expectations when cleaning my carpets, floors, upholstery, blinds, etc. The lift-off canister with shoulder sling is great, allowing me to put attachments onto the hose, including the rotating stair tool. My only knock is that the machine is heavy. My wife cannot vacuum our entire apartment without having a serious back ache. I thought she was joking until I also developed lower back strain with vacuuming the apartment."
1,Good Idea but poor quality execution,"I have owned this vacuum for about 2.5 years and that is about the useful life of it. At first I was impressed with its power and liked the lift off unit. However, after using it for about a year the cheap plastic started to break. It also clogs very easily and you have to take everything apart and make a big mess trying to clean it. The suction hose clogs and you have to run a wire through it to remove the plug.The standup unit no longer stands on its own because a chunk of plastic broke off that locks it in the up position. One of the cord receptors broke off after about 20 uses. The belt tends to make a burning smell. The flex hose is not long enough and just pulls the lift off unit over unless you always hold it in your hand.Unfortunately, all current home vacuums that I have seen are made of plastic. I agree with the previous reviewer, don't spend over $100 because it will soon be in the trash pile."
1,New recordings of THEIR greatest hits?! NOT!,"To paraphrase former Sen. Bentson: I knew the Supremes, and you, are not them!As other reviewers have written here, young folks and new fans, do not be fooled into the believing that The Supremes have re-recorded their biggest and best hits from nearly 40 years ago.The founder of the group, Florence Ballard, died 26 years ago. Diana Ross left the group 32 years ago. And the only reason these gals have gotten away with pilfering the original group's good name is because Mary Wilson was fooled into signing away her rights to the name.While any desperate group of women may trade on the name ""Supremes,"" only Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson and Diana Ross can produced that patented trademark sound -- and that hasn't happened since 1967."
5,"A ""Supreme"" Experance for the 90's","This album has Lynda Laurence, Scherrie and non-Supreme Sundray Tucker(Lynda's sister). They do great versions of all the songs. My favorites are ""Reflections,"" ""Love Child,"" and ""Nathan Jones."" They are all good, but those are my 3 favorites. The music is updated alittle bit to fit the 90's style and their voices are fantastic together! I would definitly buy this cd, if I didn't have it."
5,my hero,If only we could vote for a guy like this ... Never in my 35 years of living on this planet/country did I ever feel a person running for public office worthy of my vote. I am truly amazed. Jesse Ventura mirrors all of my own thoughts and feelings.
3,"YES, YOU DO...GET OVER IT!!!!","First, I have to say that I did like this book; when I first read it. Honestly, Mr. Ventura's positions are very close to my own and I'm sure I would have voted for him if I'd been in Minnesota.So if it's not his points that cost him the stars, what did? His attitude. Since his last year and a half in office became a minor disaster, it's only confirmed the hints in this book. Ventura is very much into himself and (like so many other's in our government halls), suprisingly unconcerned with the people. I say this because through anecdote after anecdote, a book on policy (and I believe Ventura COULD have written one if he'd lost the ego) became about what he's done and why he's done it.Still if you are a libertarian (l or L), there are some great things in here. Of course, they are better said elsewhere (all except for Ventura's deft criticism of republicrat government.) ..."
2,Jesse Bores Me,"I used to be a big Jesse Ventura fan, as a wrestler and a politician. No one was happier than me when Jesse was elected Governor and no one applauded him more when he sneered at his detractors in such an amusing manner. Lately, though, Jesse's WWF act is wearing thin. He plays the beleaguered good guy to everyone else's bad guy so often that I find myself yawning and flipping the channel when he comes on TV.Let's not forget that this is the same Jesse Ventura who is pals with Donald Trump. The same Jesse who refereed a WWF match for pay while in office. Who has spewed his ignorant racial comments about the Irish and Native Americans. Who did an interview with High Times magazine.I found it hard to take this book seriously just because I find it hard to take Jesse seriously anymore."
4,He's definately not an eloquent writer..,"..however, if you are apathetic towards government, if you think there is something wrong with today's political environment, or if you are curious as to what it is like being in a position like governor, READ THIS BOOK.Like I said, Governor Ventura is not known for his literary style. However, I could imagine the entire text of this book coming from his mouth.He has a lot of good points, and this is where this book really has its merit. I applaud his audaciousness and hope that he's NOT going to be the one standing alone in the political morass of today. Democracy depends on people participating in it. Read this book and take a stand! It's a challenge to every American."
1,I would rather buff my car with sandpaper than buy this battery again,"This battery was terrible. I bought it for my daughter's laptop and it held a charge for about a week. Now it is the same old, leave it plugged in all the time or else it will die routine. Garbage!"
1,Extremely disappointing,"I bought based on the glowing reviews of others here. This book may be helpful if you've never heard of tax liens or tax deeds before. Then the 17 pages that are the ""meat"" of this book may be very helpful.The remainder is the author repeating herself ad nauseum in a 'get started' pep talk. Blank pages at the end of each chapter, a glossary of terms, very basic legal forms, most of which aren't specific to the topic at hand. In trying to further pad her information from a brochure into a book, she went so far as to list the names of every county in every state!And of course, she has suggested reading. Only ""The 16% Solution"" addresses the relevant topic, the remainder are your usual array of self-help, business motivational books (7 Habits, Win Friends, etc.)"
5,A very informative book,This book is written in a very understandable way.It is especially good for beginners who want to learn how to invest their money to earn a very high interest rate. This has to be one of the best kept secrets. I look foreward to useing the information I've learned from this book.
1,Save yourself the money....,Half of the book is public information and over half of the book is terminology. So much say about the meat of the book.
2,New smaller size was a disappointment,"I am a big fan of the Thymes products. I was disappointed to see that this sink set now is much smaller than the traditional size I usually ordered, but I did not notice that from the picture and I didn't pay attention to the ounces. I also did not like this scent at all. This is the first and last time I will order an item before I have smelled the scent. I just assumed I would love this scent because I usually love all of their products. This is a very strong and lingering scent. Smell it before you order it."
4,Smooth,I got this from a coworker once a while back and I've been using it since. I love how it doesn't dry out your hand. Smells great!
4,Very elegant watch,"This is a beautiful and elegant watch that you can wear on a simple work day or on a special evening event, but the cronograph system is not easy to make it work. However, it is a great option for those who wants to have a nice timepiece. I recommend it"
1,Where is it?,"Gave it 1 star because I could not give it a 0.Ordered it, received confirmation of the order, received an email saying it had shipped. 2 weeks later and after 2 unanswered emails and 3 phone calls to GoVacuum, they told me that the manufacturer had discontinued it! Very sorry costomer service from them."
2,Not too well suited for beginners although intended.,"The book covers the basics of object oriented programming and C++. The book is very theoretical and together with the long code samples you are being put away from your originally idea of fully understanding how to program. You learn the object concept and then you use C++ to implement that concept. I read Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days by Jesse Liberty, and then this book. I understood this book, but lots of my schoolmaids had difficulties understanding it, probably because they didn't read ""21 Days"" first. The book is intended to teach C++ from scratch, but you have to be academically intelligent to really grasp the C++ language as it is presented in the book. The book is probably the right choice if you want information about the object concept and C++ in that context, but to my oppinion it needs to be more concrete in presenting the programming language. NOT A REALLY BAD BOOK THOUGH !"
2,How to make a difficult concept impossible,"I used this book as a required text in a university IT subject. The author has real ability when it comes to using language to confuse the reader. The index is poorly designed making it difficult to get concise information on any specific subject. I consistently read single sentences that were written in a language style that was ultimately imprecise and offered poorly explained information. The programs offered as examples, while interesting to work through, were long winded when all the reader wants is a simple example to illustrate a specific concept (ie. pointers and references). All of my fellow students had the same diffuculties and the text has been dropped for next years use. Many of the students used SAMS c++ in 24 hours at about a third of the price and fared much better. There are better books on the subject than this!"
5,it's great!,"works just like its supposed to, i couldn't be happier with this monitor. not sure what else to say, requires too many words.."
5,Wow! This was great service!,"Wow, this was great service in purchasing a monitor. I had never bought an item over the internet before. So naturally, I was nervous, but it was simple and complete. When the need arises, I will certainly use this site again. I love the monitor and will recommend to anyone that's looking for a great monitor.Thanks Amazon for making me feel so comfortable."
5,new flat panel monitor,"Price was right,shipping was prompt,quality very nice.Would not hesitate to buy from this seller again."
4,Nice Monitor,"This 19"" Wide LCD Monitor is a good buy for the price. The on and off switch could have been made better it feels loose there's no way to tighten it up. Otherwise it's a great monitor I love it."
2,Jargoon Pard,"I just finished this book (paperback). Is it just me or was that terrible. I gave it two stars because, as much as I hated it, the plot was pretty good:Kethan , heir to the throne of Car do Prawn, one day gets this belt brought by the traveller Ibycus. As it intices him, it becomes an obsession. It holds transformation powers that Kethan must figure out to control, for he is driven out of the keep by his jealous cousin Maugus. Anyway, It's a cool plot.But, I was terribly sick of the writing. Every other sentence began with an ""I"". If you're going to write in that 1st person, you cant write it like that. She seemed to throw in details just as they became effective. It was written like a journal. And there was hardly any dialogue. I was not impressed. The details themselves were not even that clear.Anyways, I felt this was a terrible book.Good plot, Bad English.Oh yeah, the word ""stuff"" made me really angry."
1,"DVD review, not movie review","I must have picked up a defective pressing of this movie but my DVD screwed up the sound/picture synchronization. Side two is worse than side one. This alone makes this DVD a one-star disc. I've never had a problem with this in a DVD ever. It really makes it unwatchable. BTW, I bought my copy at Walmart in the $5 display. By all appearances, this is not a pirated disc."
3,From a Stephen King Fan,"I would like this movie regardless, because I am a Stephen King fan, but it is a bit dated and there seems to be too many stories going on at a time, I don't think it flows, to a very well explained climax, still I gave it 3 stars because it kept me entertained.I purchased the DVD because I am collecting all of King's movies, and I am watching them more than once, but it will be a bit longer before I get around to this one again. If you are after a scare rating, this would only get a 1 on a 1-5 scale. I would never compare any movie based on one of his books and I have not read this one, but I can certainly imagine the story and characters coming together in the way he weaves a tale, I will endeavor to read the book."
1,Absolute Garbage; Not Worth Watching,"This is by far the worst movie adaptation of a Stephen King book. Large chunks of the plot were cut out. The movie is chock-full of TV/movie cliches. The acting throughout is cheesy; one expression would be that the actors are chewing the scenery. The ending is changed around completely - in the book, the good guys don't win, and there is an appropriate apocalyptic resolution to the story; in the movie, the plot changes course for no apparent reason and the ending makes absolutely no sense. Don't even bother renting the movie unless you can't read. The book is a lot better and it will scare the **** out of you."
1,the worst movie,this movie was the worst i have ever seen if any of you would like to see i sugest you don't spend your money on this film... just take it from me it is the worst movie you can ever rent the bood was better
1,tommyknockers,"I wanted to buy this movie after reading the book to compare the differences between the pieces. Upon watching the movie and comparing it to the book, I was very disappointed in the movie. It does not follow the book well enough to earn the creditation it has receieved. In my opinion, the movie has far too many variations from the book and doesn't have the detail the book has. I understand that a movie is only based on the novel, but I don't believe the movie does justice to the book at all. I am a strong Stephen King fan and have read many of his novels...as well as watched the movies based on those novels. Usually the movies follow fairly well with the novel. The movie for Tommyknockers does not. I would have expected some variation of the movie, however not to the extent this movie was."
2,Excellent Book... Not a very good movie and bad acting!,"I love the book ""The Tommyknockers"" and I also enjoy most movies that are made from King's books, but this one (and ""Thinner"") is an exception. First of all, the acting is horrible. The funny thing is that the best acting comes from former pornstar Traci Lords, and that still isn't very good (but she does look very hot...). The effects are pretty poor and always look the same (ie. green lights). Some of the things from the book translated nicely, like the shed, but otherwise I believe that if I hadn't read the book first that it wouldn't have made any sense at all. It's really sad when I have to say the line: ""The best thing about this movie is Traci Lords."". Skip this and read the book."
2,Not as scarey as I'd thought!,"While not a Stephan King fan, I am a Jimmy Smits fan so I checked out this movie. It wasn't as creepy as I thought it might be, and Jimmy had some pretty good scenes along the way. Not my favourite sort of viewing, but nice to see Smits!"
4,ARE YOU PEOPLE MAD?,"Why give it such low ratings? I loved it! The only thing wrong with it, I thought, was the fakeness of the aliens but besides they it was smart."
1,This is really stupid!,This has to be Stephen King's worst work adapted. This adaptation is even worse than Needful Things. Children Of The Corn (I am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels) was miles abouve better than this garbage. Just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book. Just plain trash.
2,Disappointed,"First of all let me say that I am a HUGE Stephen King fan. I love his books and some of his movies. But I don't love this movie. I don't know how someone could come up with this bad of a movie from a pretty good book. First of all, without giving too much of the movie away let me say this, in the book they uncover a flying saucer. Whatever the thing in the movie is, it isn't a flying saucer. It blows my mind that they would change something this central to the point. And as some other reviews have stated, by just watching the movie, you have no idea why some of the characters are not affected by the ship like the others. My recommendation would be to take a little more time and read the book. You will be better off if you did. If you want to watch a Stephen King movie watch It, The Shining, Pet Semetary, Storm of the Century or the Stand."
2,Audio issues,"My single flipdisc DVD of THE TOMMYKNOCKERS is on the Trimark label, not Lion's Gate, as stated in Ammy's Product Description.If you don't choose NONE on the Subtitles screen prior to starting the film, it automatically defaults to French subtitles. This is a minor annoyance.More troubling is that the sound isn't in synch with the video. You hear words a quarter of a second before an actor's mouth moves. That's a major flaw, thus my Two Star rating."
2,Good God where should I begin?,"This movie was just awful. I've read every book & watched every movie with the King's name attached to it. This book was so awesome & this movie was soooo bad. Why do people take a wonderful story and butcher it like this? Why? Do yourself a favor, go to the library, read tbe book for free & save your money."
2,Tommy Knock-it-off,"It teaches us about substance abuse. Meaning most of the story talks about how a certain substance increases your creativity but also increases your dependency. Seeing one man trying get rid of his dependency while helping others beat theirs. Like every other Stephen King movie,this plot has great bulid-up but has a lousy pay-off in the end. It also has every overused casting cliches like the cheater,the drinker and so many others. Some of the acting is soo over-the-top,it's laughable. What else can I say? It's stupid but it's a fun kind of stupid and also one of the more entertaining films to say the least. I give this film a 3 out of 10."
2,"Not bad, but not great","I have seen lots of movies, alot good, alot bad. This ranks somewhere in the middle. It was kind of boring, the only really good part was the end and that was not to great.For me the book was so much better. I think you should read the book befor waching the movie"
2,Why?,"There's a hilarious article archived in ""The Onion"" about Steven King claiming he was drunk when he wrote ""The Tommyknockers."" All joking aside, the book was regarded as one of his worst. Putting Jimmy Smits in a movie version isn't going to set things right. If you are dying for a good King adaptation, why not revisit Cujo or The Shining, or even the new remake of Salem's Lot? Let's just push this one back under the bed and forget it's there..."
2,Knock knock! Who's there? Campy Sci-Fi Fun.,"Brutal body-snatching alien mayhem,green glowing force-fieldsand Traci Lords with disintegrator death-ray lipstick.What's not to like?Worth watching once."
2,A lot of green light and not much else.,"Rule number one if you're making a Stephen King movie, especially if it's a TV movie; make it scary or don't make it at all! THE TOMMYKNOCKERS fails to do this miserably! For most of the film, you're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions. Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it. There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late. You've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an X-FILES episode.On the plus side, I had no problem watching the infamous Traci Lords act like like a total slut! Bless her!"
3,Tommyknockers knocking at the door,"I am a fan of Stephen King and recently it seems that all of his work is been addited for movies. The Tommyknockers or De Gloed (the glow) in dutch is a very good book, as I like SF as well. So when I bought the video I was a little bit chocked. It started well but you will never know why Gardener wasn't affected by the alien influence and later on it seems they run out of time to show the book properly. Nevertheless a average Stephen King movie in the same categorie as movies like the Sphere or Event Horizon. Nice movies but still missing the juice that combines all the ingredients."
1,Poor Quality,"I'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot. It's redundant and unnecessary, and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent. Only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself. Double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that's based on and well...My gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it's original format onto DVD was bad. The soundtrack is about 1/2 to 1 second off from the video part of film, therefore the voices don't sync up with the lip movement."
1,So bad it was almost funny...,"This movie was 6 hours of my life that I can never get back. If I hadn't already invested 3 hours in it, I would have turned it off in the middle of the movie. That's what I should have done. Funny, I liked the book and have really loved a lot of Stephen King's books and movies. But this was trash and it should be thrown away."
2,Disappointed,"THE TOMMYKNOCKERS sounded like a fairly good movie from what I had heard. But one night, I decided to rent it with my relatives and it was close to being the worst show based on a novel from Stephen King. Some scenes are pointless, acting is bad in parts and more than half of it was just the stupid light that kept transforming people to evil. I was very disappointed in this movie. Most likely the only badly-crafted Stephen King movie there is!"
2,Not good at all!,"I had high hopes for this product. However, it simply does not work. There is no active ingredient that helps psoriasis. It did absolutely nothing but moisturize. It also contains fragrance which is ridiculous for a skin condition like psoriasis. I'd pass on this one."
3,Alright...,"So I have psoriasis on my scalp and a bit on my face. I was hoping from the reviews that this item would help clear it up. This however is not a cure, to it at all as some of the reviews might lead you to believe.This product is very much a lotion. However it does contain a lot of salt, so it is somewhat thick. When you apply it to affect areas, it helps slightly with the flaking of the skin. What I mean by this is that it basically keeps your skin from being so dry and helps with the cracking of the skin caused by psoriasis. In terms of reducing redness, it does not help. I guess you could also say this lotion can disinfect affect areas, since it does contain salt, which is good I guess."
2,Didn't do the trick.,"My psoriasis may have been a little lighter using this, but my skin also got kind of dried out and salty feeling. Will be moving on to something else."
2,may work for some people not for me,I ordered this hoping it would live up to some of its reviews. As anyone with psorasis knows what works for one may not work for someone else. I have a good size patch on my ankle and across the front of my foot. My knee and my fore arm. Didnt do anything for my knee and arm these spots are not that bad small patches just kind of starting. However the hot spot on my ankle it ended up burning when applied. I figured maybe thats normal. But it actually got more red and irritated.
2,Not very effective,"Bought this cream for a relative who has psoriasis,due to Diabetes. He has been using this now for a few weeks and so far no change in the the condition. Was also surprised by the size of the bottle,very small,is enough for maybe 2-3 weeks tops,if used sparingly."
5,Great CD,"Good CD that demonstrates the old, west coast style of hip-hop. One of 2Pac's great albums, with great lyrics and mellow beats."
4,surprisingly good,"I was very surprised with this cd. I knew 2pac was a great lyricist far before I bought this, but I was unsure about the other rappers on this disc, Mopreme, The Rated R, Big Syke, and Macadoshis. Of course none of them even come close to touching 2pac's skills, however all of them, especially Mopreme, show that they can hold their own. My favorite tracks are ""Pour Out A Little Liquor"", ""Stay True"", ""How Long Will They Morn Me?"", ""Str8 Ballin"", and my favorite track off of the album; ""Cradle To The Grave"" which is 6 minutes and 13 seconds of each rapper on the disc basically summing up the troubles of their lives. All in all, this is no ""Me Against The World"", or even ""All Eyez On Me"", but if you even remotely like 2pac and already have all his solo recordings before his death and want more, then purchase this."
3,Pretty good but highly overrated,"Talk around town is that this is one of the best albums ever which is not true by a longshot... I own all of Tupac's official ALBUMS and this prolly the worst, not meaning it's bad but not as good as a Pac-album usually is...Pac is on about 7 of the 10 songs... a couple of classics no real bad songs but some are just soso..."
5,Badness!,"This 94' band includes stars such as: 2pac,Skye,and nate dogg.Theres two bad songs which are ""Bury me a G""and ""How long will they mourn me"".You like rap?Then you'll love this."
3,pretty good,"This album is better than 2Pacalypse Now but it is not better than Makaveli.This album had alot of talent. My favorite songs are ""How Long Will They Mourn Me?"", and ""Under Pressure."""
4,Thug Life,"Thug Life ten tracks have more bang for your buck.Then some Cds which have 20 tracks.You should check out track seven ""Under Pressure""and track 6 ""How Long Will They Mourn Me"""
5,2 Thumbs Up!,"What made me want to buy 2Pac's Thug Life was hearing it's song How Long Will They Mourn Me? with Nate Dogg. This is one of 2Pac's best albums. it includes songs from the Tupac Shakur Ressurection soundtrack. Str8 ballin' & Bury Me a G were featured on the soundtrack. This album really does have some of 2Pac's best songs, I recomend it."
5,2Pac and his boys kill on this album,"This is a short album but a very good album. There arent any skits which is a good thing because there are only 10 songs. But these are 10 good songs. I wish there would have been some more volumes added to the collection but I guess this is enough. If you are a 2pac fan you gotta pick up this album or if you just want to hear some good rap from the early 90's that was beyond its time, pick up this album. This was the last CD I had to buy to make my 2pac collection complete and since I waited so long to buy it I could only find it in certain places and I ended up paying $20 dollars for it.... but it was money WELL SPENT!!!!!!!!"
5,"As good as ""All Eyez on Me""","This album is just awesome. ""Pour Out a Little Liquor"" is 2pac's best song ever, and ""Bury Me a G"", ""S#it Don't Stop"", Stay True"", How Long Will They Mourn Me?"", ""Under Pressure"", ""Cradle to the Grave"", and ""Str8 Ballin'"" are all great songs. This album gets 10 stars."
5,Thug Life 4ever,This CD is great!If your a true 2pac fan you'll get this cd.The better songs on the cd are BURY ME A G-POUR OUT A LITTLE LIQUOR-HOW LONG WILL THEY MOURN ME?-STR8 BALLIN'.If you feel this nigga this is the cd you'll add to your collection!
5,thug life volume 1,i still put this in the deck and ride thru the whole album this is probably 2pac most overlooked work cant belive its been 15 years since this was releaed if you dont have this c d go get it now
5,old school,"Buy this album listen to stay true then put the top back on your ride and keep it movin. His lyrics once again are official, no matter what he spits you know it's as powerful as a parable... (songs to look forward to besides stay true are bury me a g and how long will they mourn me, go buy this album you won't regret it."
5,THUG LIFE (2pac's 1st Classic),"Thug Life is very underground, some people don't know that this is really where it all started for 2Pac. This is the album where he found his signature style of stressing the words. This album is short but sweet no filler. I Get Around and Pain sparked my interest in Pac, so I went and bought this album, which was the 1st Pac album I bought. It starts with Bury Me A G remake of Isley's song 5/5, Don't Get It Twisted 4/5 Pac's not on that song but Thug Life group ripped it, Sh** Dont Stop 4/5, Pour Out A Little Liquor 5/5 is 1 of his best songs, along with How Long Will You Mourn Me, Cradle To The Grave 5/5 and Str8 Balling5/5. A couple of my other favorites, Stay True 5/5 and Under Pressure 5/5 are on here. Then u have Street Fame 4/5 no Pac on this song either. This is also the 1st album where Pac starts rapping about death. This is a classic album and also a new beginning for Pac."
2,Too Small!,"I think they should substitute ""Small"" for ""Midsize"" in the description of this item. I just returned it because it was too small. Entire states are on one letter-size page and only major roads are shown. I bought it because the Large Scale Atlas is not available in spiral bound except for the one with the Travel Guide which makes it too big and heavy. I have now ordered the Travel Guide version and intend to tear out the Travel Guide section."
2,Steinbeck flashback,"I bought this book based on the review that is was like John Steinbeck's ""The Pearl"" but this was nothing like that. I missed the sensitivity and caring feeling in this book."
2,not the greatest,"I did not find this book to be interesting and it did not grasp my attention. I did not think that the characters were developed very well. I did not feel for the bird man or any of the other characters and their tragic lives. However, Sandra Benitez is a wonderful person and instructor. I am still looking forward to reading The Weight of all Things. I would love to read a book about her life growing up in Latin America as well. I am sorry to have to give Ms. Benitez a rating of a 2. If you want to read the work of Ms. Benitez do not start with this book."
4,Good ending...,wow I would read this book to bed like everyday for a week. Its rare how all the chapters are characters yet they all click and are linked one way or the other. The ending was sad yet it was different. It's a good book to read. It's not a book that will hit your soul but it is a good book b/c is a story you wouldnt be surprise to hear from your grandmother.
2,I have to read it.,"I don't really get this book, but I have to read it for school. I need MAJOR help."
5,I'll remember Sea Remembers.,"This was a great book full of wonderful characters who are interwoven with tragedy and despair and, most importantly, hope."
1,The only reason to buy this Sham live cd,"Only buy this one if you don't expect to ever find the ""Live at the Roxy""cd. About 80% of that cd re-appears here (even though the original Roxy cd only runs for about 35 minutes). After this compiled part a few tracks are added from the a concert that has been released 3 (three) times before (see: The Best And The Rest from 1990 and the re-release ""Sham 69 Live"" from 1993 which are complete, or the almost complete ""Sham 69 live-United"" on Hallmark from 1996. Be warned...."
1,Bad sound,Don't listen to the other review. This is when Sham added a keyboard and this has nothing to do with The Roxy. Most of the songs on here were written long after The Roxy had closed it's doors. Think that this is live in Italy but I could be wrong. This is from a live cd from around late 78 or so. The sound is boot quality and not worth the purchase unless you are a diehard Sham 69 fan. 'Nuff said.
3,Not Mowat's best book,"I'm a big fan of Farley Mowat, but this is not a book that I would rank among his best. I just couldn't get into it, although some of the stories were entertaining. Nagging questions about the manner in which he may have embellished the stories dogged me throughout."
4,the snow walker,"This was an interesting story explaining the hard life of the people in Canadian north West and their survival. Very deep stpry telling by an insider, Farley Mowat."
3,Interesting movie with surprises and twists,"For all the people with a 1 Star and a complaint it seems they should stick to movies with a $500 million budget. This is a good movie with twists and turns and surprises and I got you's.Yes, is it a little slow in the beginning, of course. But the filming style is excellent. Did I like the ending, NO, but did I get it, yes. It actually made me laugh.If you want to enjoy a movie that surprises you, aka I see dead people then watch this. I have paid $12 for movies that I would like to walk out on. This movie would have been worth the price of admition though on netflix it was free and the HD was great.Enjoy"
3,good but no real ending,"This would have been a good movie if it had had an ending. It was as if this were a pilot for a series. With all the buildup I was expecting a real ending. Also, I didn't get why the quote from Darwin was shown at the beginning as it seemed to have no real bearing on the plot. I didn't see that anybody particularly demonstrated survival by being adaptable rather than strong and intelligent. I was expecting the prisoner to demonstrate some such thing. Or somebody to. The things I liked about the movie were the interesting scenery and the twists in the plot."
5,Great movie,"Even though I am not a big Sci-Fi fan it definitely caught my attention. Developing story and unexpected twists had me glued to my screen for the entire time. The actions take place on a different planet, which I always find captivating. The quality of the picture and the whole scenery are outstanding. And the end is...I'll let you watch it for yourself. To make the story short, actors and the rest of the team did a fantastic job carrying on the story and creating this movie. I highly recommend to watch it. You won't regret it."
3,decent movie. dont know if it watch it more than once,"This movie had great promise but was spoiled for me by corny dialog and so so acting. The cinematography is great along with pretty decent CGI effects, however, the movie was more predictable in parts than I had hoped for. The ending was too abrupt and left many questions open. If the dialog wasn't so corny even the so so acting could've made this movie work. Overall, the premise was great and it's worth a watch, but because of the poor writing, corny dialog, and predictability, I would only give this movie a 3/5."
5,Great product!,This is a great product. I highly recommend it. This album is great and the packaging and cd were in excellent condition.
4,Political Pac,"This is by far 2pac's most political album. With ""trapped"", ""I don't give a f***"" and ""Words of Wisdom"", it is. There is the classic, Brendas got a baby, and the F- the police songs like ""violent"" and ""trapped"". Its not 2pac's best. If you want his best, buy the Greatest Hits Cd or ""All Eyez on Me"". But if you are an old school hip hop fan, or just like people rebelling against society, than ""2pacalypse Now"" is for you."
4,Strong debut from the g.o.a.t,"This album is great, there are obviously better produced albums of his but this album of all of them probably has the best most deep lyrics and depics a young black males struggle through life and is worth it just for the lyrics it could b accapella n it wud still b gud but there are also some very well produced songs on it also and are just great and i highly reccomend this to any 2pac fan, the stand out songs are as followsTrappedIf My Homie CallsBrenda's Got A BabyRebel Of The UndergroundPart Time Mutha"
4,"Early and Arrogant, but still very good","2Pac is just one of those artists that gets better with time. From the start of his career up until his life was tragically cut short, 2Pac always refined his music and always had new ideas for songs. 2Pacalypse Now is early 2Pac when he was young and arrogant, and it shows. The beats in 2Pacalypse Now are not as strong or catchy as in his later albums, the lyrics are less refined, and the overall flow of the cd is not as fluid as his later work. However, this CD is still great and is definitely a must-have for any 2Pac fan. But, if you are new to 2Pac I highly recommend buying ""All Eyez on Me"" and ""Me Against the World"" first."
3,2Pac's Road To Stardom,"Few expected former Digital Underground member Tupac Amaru Shakur to become hip-hop enemy number one when he made his solo debut with this 1991 album. Songs like ""Crooked Ass Nigga"" and ""Tha' Lunatic"" might have hinted that storm clouds were on the horizon, but there were also excellent advocacy numbers like ""Words Of Wisdom"" and ""Young Black Male."" This didn't make him a celebrity, but it put Tupac Shakur on the road to stardom."
3,An Average Debut for the Greatest MC of All Time,"This album simply suffers from poor production, plain and simple that is the problem with ""2Pacalypse Now"". 2Pac's lyrics are at his finest coming at listeners from all angles (politically, racially and partying). This album is a must have for hard core hip hop fans, your collection would be empty without this LP. Highlights appear on the lead single ""Trapped"" and ""Brenda's Got A Baby""."
1,Dissatisfied,"Bad digital copy, one of the songs was incomplete,and the cover was made out of the same material as a cereal box with a photocopy of the original CD taped on the front. I ordered this CD to build my collection. It was cheap but now I have to go buy it again. Very disappointed"
3,straight,"was a good album. ... i thought it was very underrated and should of sold more copies (500,000+). had a lot of old school beats. favorite songs were part time mutha, i dont give a ..., and violent. was a different 2pac then the thugged out death row 2pac. i liked the thugged out 2pac better but this was still good. a good debut album.by 2pacs #1 fan."
3,2Pacalypse Now and Then,"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best side of 2Pac: young, aggressive and political. 2Pacalypse Now isn't as finely trimmed as it's follow-up, 'Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.', but it's violent, intensive and, um, West Coast. Songs like 'Soulja's Story', 'Brenda's Got A Baby' and 'Violent' all take stand on meaningful things like ghetto violence, young mothers and the corruption of the police department in general. 'If My Homie Calls' is so West Coast it puts Cali Love and To Live And Die In L.A. to shame. The production, on the other hand, is very old school. Lots of live instruments and tempo varieties, heavy piano and bass lines. At this time 2Pac's raw lyrics were at their best. All in all, if you're planning on buying a 2Pac album, I sure would recommend either this, 'Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.' or 'Me Against The World'. Get ready to be shook, though."
4,A very decent start,"Unlike Snoop Dogg, Biggie, Nas etc, it took Pac 2 albums to get to classic. But this album is still a good effort. While production lacks a fare bit on most tracks, Pac's very intelligent rhyming and story telling make this well worth listening to. Its certainly alot different to his others but i still recommend it well. It is unfortunate that like ""The Main Man"" said, it wasn't appreciated until years after his sad passing.Top 51. Brenda's Got A Baby - Another of Pac's very heartfelt tracks, whether based on a true story or not its an excellent song2. Soulja's Story - Very good storytelling3. Words Of Wisdom - A decent beat with very political lyrics4. If My Homie Calls - best beat on the album5. Violent - like soulja's story, Pac tells a creepy story about police brutality"
4,Good but beats are really old '91,there were great albums released in the early 90's and late 80's like Organized Konfusion-self titled and Slick Rick-Great Adventures but this cd compared to those have pretty bad beats but still worth buying for to collect all of pacs cd's and brendas got a baby is a classic for now and years to comeFavorite Track:Brenda's Got A Baby8 of 10 lyrics 6 of 10 beats
3,2Pacalypse Now!,"I am a very big 2pac fan.But this wasn't one of his best cd's.Soulja's Story is probably the best song on it.Don't get me wrong,this is a great cd, hardcore,phat,meaningful.If you don't feel Tupac Shakur,this cd aint for you!"
3,Decent but not great,"This is a good cd for anyone else but, for tupac it is his worst album. If u want some good tupac albums by All Eyez On Me, Greatest Hits, and Stictly 4 My Niggaz ."
3,Good solid CD but not that great,This CD is solid and has a great beat but it's not really that great. Just because he is dead doesn't make all Tupac's stuff excellent. If you are looking for a really good Tupac CD that captures his spirit get the 'For My NIGGAZ' album but avoid the overhyped 2pacalypse Now.
3,2pacalypse Now Cassette Tape: too political for me.,"too political, too anti-whitey, but nonetheless good material and it's pac. The best song is Brenda's Got a Baby about A Woman with no morals. the first of pac's albums, before he matured and got better . the Best Rapper ever. R.I.P."
3,not one of his best.....,"this isnt the best 2pac cd, but its good because after all, Its 2Pac.I didnt listen to it that much but the only song i like so far is ""Brendas Got a Baby"""
2,2pacawhu ?,This cd is ok plain and simple hes definently had way better than this. All eyez on me is definently a 5 star pick that up and get strictly for my niggaz that bangin too but this nahh jus not fellin it.
3,Okay Washington insider novel,"This book gives an insider's look at ""beltway politics."" In that regards, it's a good read. Don't expect literary stuff: good characterization, etc. etc."
1,A Real Let-Down,"I've read his non-fiction and expected better. While there is some good insider stuff, the characters are unconvincing, the plot becomes totally implausible, and he glosses over some pretty important (and unbelievable) occurences (such as an MIA returning from a Russian gulag after nealy 30 years! Guess what? He's not bitter at all! And no one in the US Govt. is upset!) A poorly imagined novel that is yearning, no doubt, to find new life as a screen play. Might not make a bad movie, but art this is not."
3,OK work!,"I will stand by my earlier reviews of this book. There is very little new in the way of work done here. Despite one reviewer saying that the author interviewed Gerard Zinser, the last survivor of the 109, it simply is not the case. And there are no new interviews with comrades of JFK's who were in the squadron. Again this is nothing but a rehash of the old Kennedy myth!"
1,Falls short,"I stand by my earlier review of the book. There is very little in the way of new scholarship here. Take a look at the endnotes, most are citations from other volumes. I also found it sad that others have to resort to sarcasim in their reviews. The story of PT 109 in this volume is not fair or true. It was not Kennedy that enable the crew to be rescued, but rather Lenny Thom, the XO. Before you attack someone on these pages, you should do your homework."
2,Very Disappointing,"As I read this book, I was struck by how little new research was done. All the information seems to have been pulled from other secondary sources. No PT vets were interviewed. And the account of the post sinking of PT 109 is all KENNEDY KENNEDY KENNEDY! No mention whatsoever of the heroics of Lenny Thom, the XO of that boat, who wrote the note that got them rescued. It was NOT the coconut shell! When will the truth be told~?"
4,Balanced Portrait,"Note to the previous reviewer: I agree, it was very disengenuous of the author to focus on ""Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy"" in a book entitled ""The Kennedy's at War"".Good portrait of the malevolent Joseph P. Kennedy who continued with his defeatist meanderings even after U.S. entry into the War. Joe Jr. emerges as a chip off the old block, while the future President seems to have benefitted from a lower level of expectations and parental guidance.The author references young Jack's frequent illnesses, and more frequent affairs, but he doesn't dwell on them unnecessarily. Instead, he provides ample evidence of a complex young man with an incisive analytical mind and a casually fatalistic approach to life."
1,better check the shipping,"Some dunce in amazon has removed the free shipping from these cartridges, at $5 APIECE shipping, Hardly a bargain, nore like rapeage. Get them directly from epson cheaper. Cancel your orders, everyone that Thought they were on sale, this is horrible on amazon's part."
1,ouch,"By the end of Chapter Five, the author had flogged me with the phrase 'Texas Ranger' more than thirty times, with far too many of them attached to the heroine's husband's full name, i.e.'Jack Galway, TEXAS RANGER.' (my caps.) The cast, who supposedly already knew the heroine, spoke in awkward, expositional sentences like, ""Hello, Susanna Dunning Galway, stubborn, willful, separated wife of Jack Galway, TEXAS RANGER. How is that ten million dollars you have that you haven't told your Texas Ranger husband about yet and oh, have you told him about Beau Garrity, your secret stalker of one year ago who might have murdered his wife and the reason you separated from your husband Jack Galway, Texas Ranger?"" The villains are limp spaghetti and their motivations ridiculous. Iris Dunning, the supposed grand dame is no more memorable than the Galway daughters. I kept hoping for an avalanche but I couldn't read past page 200 because I simply didn't care if they all lived or died."
1,Insulting Read,"If you see yourself as a strong, intelligent woman, DO NOT read this book. The 'heroine' is anything but! Her rationalizations of why not to report key information regarding a murderer to her 'wonderful Texas Ranger' husband, and her reluctance to 'clue' this hunk in on her lucrative business, is beyond any normal persons reasoning. And her teen aged daughters behaviors? Is anyone that foolish?Oh, and can she possible squeeze ""Texas Ranger"" into anymore sentences...on the SAME page?Normally I consider all books worth reading, but I'll not soon pick up another one of Carla's."
5,Her best yet,"You can read the plot summary from the other reviews, I'll just say that I really like the characters that Neggers creates in this book. The heroine is almost forty; a nice change. And the eighty year grandmother is a real person, who not only has an intriguing past, but who is also still an interesting person. And then there's Jack and Sam. I'm assuming that Sam will get his own book soon; will he be paired with one of the twins? I enjoyed THE CABIN more than THE CARRIAGE HOUSE. Would I tell my husband if I'd made $10 million dollars? It wouldn't be easy if it made him feel threatened. Just think of all the romance novels I could buy secretly on line."
4,"Love it, love it!","So, in this continuation of the series of friends from Somerville, MA (Read the Carriage House first) Susanna has secrets she finds she can't share with her husband Jack, and afraid of what her emotions mean to their marriage - she ""runs"" away from him. When in danger he comes to her rescue only to find that she has to rescue him, too. Oh my gosh - Neggers is a hidden gem and this just continues my love of her books that I just can't put down! Just keep writing Carla!"
3,A pretty good book,"So far this book I'm reading is pretty good, becuase it's very suspensful and nothing predictable happens when you think it will. I would recommend this book to other people who like suspensful fiction books."
4,Slow,I kept thinking this book would get better but it did NOT. Maybe it was because I am married to a lawman. It was just so unreal. I kept reading thinking it would have a good suprise ending. But it did not. Maybe I was just not in the mood for this kind of book. I do know that makes a difference. I would have to be fair and say give it a try because she is one of my favorite authers
4,Classic,This is a classic and is timeless. It was nice to re-read stories from my childhood. Recommended read for everyone
2,"Huge, but its free","At this point I am really hoping this is basically a complete compendium of Andersens fairy tails. Either something is getting lost in translation, or I am missing the right cultural references to understand the point of over half of these stories. This book is huge, even on kindle. It must resemble an dictionary in print for size."
1,Bad Translation,"Sure, this Kindle version may include all of the stories written by H. C. Andersen, but the translation is poor and imprecise, which I felt detracted too much from the stories themselves. If you want to know the basic stories, then this book is fine, but if you want to enjoy well-worded story-telling, this is definitely not the version for you. For those who enjoy a beautiful telling, I suggest purchasing one of the better-translated, illustrated Kindle versions."
4,Andersen's Fairy Tales,"Some of the stories in here were really cool, very interesting. But some of them were down right weird and hard to comprehend. But the good outweighed the weird, so I really liked it."
5,Fairy Tales for All Ages,"This is an extremely readable selection of 26, out of about 156, of Hans Andersen tales. As the brief but very fine and helpful introduction by Naomi Lewis points out, these tales are perhaps more for adults than children, as Andersen himself wanted them to be. Most of them have a darker side. I also believe that the eminent literary critic, Harold Bloom, includes Andersen in his select list of short story writers qualified to be part of the Western canon. I did prefer some of the collection's early and middle tales, such as ""Little Claus and Big Claus,"" ""The Travelling-Companion,"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" to a handful of the later ones like ""She was Good for Nothing,"" or ""The Family and the Gardener."" It seems that Andersen's true imaginary gifts shine best where his writing is least in step with the real world."
1,Changed Version,"I have always loved Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales, but found this book a disappointment. The stories were rewritten and I was hoping to read them in their original form. One of my favorite stories has always been ""The Little Match Girl"", and the changes made to it in this book, ruined it for me.If you're a fan of the original stories, you will not be happy with the retelling of them in this book. I disliked it so much that I deleted it from my library."
4,Five out of ten tracks are true marvels - 4.6 stars,"Yet another of those mid 70's R&B; highlights that are out of print or astronomically prized. There are no weak tracks and five marvels, namely:Love's on the Menu, The devil in Mrs Jones, Thank you early bird(my favorite), as well as the first and third track. These compete with the best of Ashford&Simpson; or Barry White. The female choir does a terrific job throughout, akin to Johnny Bristol's all time great ""Hang on in there Baby"". If you like this one, get the Jerry Butler&Thelma; Houston collaboration as well!"
5,Oh my...,This is one of the most incredible albums I've ever heard. Mesmerizing is just the beginning. Adam's music has the ability to transport you and you can tell that the line-up on this recording is connected at the heart.I absolutely look forward to anything this group will produce.This group is definitely worthy of major-label attention (if they've not gotten it already).
4,Great introduction to Cortazar,"If you would like to read Cortazar but are intrigued by his style, this great and simple yet mind challenging book showcases his great imagination and story-telling power. In ""Autopistas del Sur..."" he takes us through a wide range of stories, from childhood memories to enchanted houses to simple life events."
2,Complicado,"Creo que simplemente Cortazar no es para mi..... Es la primera vez que leo algo suyo y la verdad es que lo unico que me dejo en la mente fue un gran signo de interrogacion.... Algunos cuentos me parecieron bien, pero la mayoria me resultaron sumamente complicados de entender, con una narracion enrroscada que varias veces giraba en circulos y parecia no llegar a ningun lado. Y ni que hablar de los finales...... La autopista del Sur me dejo en ascuas sin saber que paso ni poder imaginarmelo siquiera......No, realmente Cortazar no es para mi."
3,Terry Jones' Canterbury Tales,"I was a little disappointed because I thought this was going to be a filmed version of some of the Canterbury Tales. Instead, it is a narrative by T. Jones about the background history of the times, and of Chaucer, and shows some places in England that relate to the Tales. The DVD is interesting to me because I have a deep interest in English history, but was not what I expected. There was no way to discern this from my reading of the blurb that accompanied the Amazon DVD info. Or, because it didn't say 'narrative only', I expected something different.Nonetheless, I have appreciated it for what it is. Just wish I'd known that before I sent for it."
2,Not up to British standards,"Did not care for this video. It is long and drawn out, and seems to focus on information not really needed for the study of Chaucer. My students seemed bored, and I, myself, became a little bored when I previewed it at home. Would not recommend it. Am looking for a replacement."
3,Not What I expected,"I had hoped for a bit about the sources of his Canterbury Tales. It did inspire me to read ""who Murdered Chaucer"". Some interesting ideas there..."
3,Chaucer,"The picture quality is not the best - and Terry Jones is somehow being interviewed - if they would have filmed one of his lectures, it would have been much better."
1,lousy movie,This was a stinky movie right from the start. Bad acting. Bad story. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.the end was the best part.
1,A WASTE OF MY TIME!,"It was probably a shuck-decent movie. I kind of remember it being thus. However, being a movie from the '90s, the sound was so poor that, even with my speakers fully pumped, I could barely understand the normal-volume dialog and I ended up deleting it after the first half hour. Why can't Amazon bother to compensate for poor volume??? Because Amazon simply doesn't care???"
2,SLOW THRILLER,"Didn't really like this movie. Too slow. We wouldn't watch it again, like some movies we keep to enjoy over and over."
3,Boilerplate thriller plot with brilliant dialogue,"John Berlin (Garcia) has left his past behind in the big city--or so he thinks. He's gone to a smaller police department in a quiet area. Naturally, one of his first calls is to a homicide investigation at a dump and he's back with big-city crime and a case that's been haunting him.Is a serial killer on the loose? He's the only one who thinks so. He's not just dealing with blind justice, but a blind witness as well. Helene (Thurman) can only help him with what she hears.Can Berlin keep himself together and keep Helene safe as he tries to solve the crime? While the movie plot's weak, the dialogue could come out of a classic noir novel and some of it is brilliant. Also brilliant is John Malkovich's appearance as an Internal Affairs officer late in the film.Rebecca Kyle, September 2009"
4,Shows Thurman's promise early.,Jennifer 8 (Widescreen Edition)This early work of Uma Thurman displays her talent. For a really early example of course there was Dangerous Liaisons. Terrific work as blind woman comfortable in familiar surroundings and helpless in unfamiliar ones.
3,"Not bad, but not wonderful either.","Except for that disappointing ending that came too soon, I thought that this film was pretty good. It was quite suspensful and had great music (from Christopher Young, writer of the music from Urban Legend), which I know how to play. Uma played Helena so well that if I walked onto the set while they were filming the movie and didn't know who she was, I would have thought that she was really blind."
5,The Buck Stops Here,This is the last book of a series. The whole series is great. It puts mystery and romance together and is hard to put down until it is finished.
3,Interesting ending but better environmental report,"This is an interesting ending to the Million Dollar series but more interesting is the commentary made on New Orlean's precarious environmental condition in relation to it's urbanization. Before Katrina hit, Clark was already writing about how dangerous it was to hold back the Mississippi and even more importantly (which we still don't hear about), the effect this is having on the bayous."
5,Can't live without...,"I have used this product for years. It is the perfect finish, turning my very fine limp hair into a ""do"" that lasts all day without weighing it down. I lift my hair and spray the shafts for body that lasts and lasts. When I could no longer find the product in the stores I started buying it through Amazon where I can shop for the best price. I highly recommend this product and Amazon for the best price and quick delivery."
5,Happy Customer!,Good and quick service! My grandparents loved it! It is small but not too small. If you want a perfect gift this is a nice selection
2,"Musically good, vocally awful","I actually did buy this album hearing about how great these guys from Britain are. A friend let me borrow this album and I thought well this does have some good solos and riffs, solid double bass drumming and a good bass player. But the nasally vocals and emo screams quickly made this album boring quickly, the vocals were, lets say it was, ""too radio friendly"" to be a metal vocals, no growls and the clean vocals were not my cup of tea(and I hate tea). My advice for BFMV is if they want to make it in the metal world get a new singer and push the singer back into rhythm guitarrist unless they want to keep him and appeal to the emo kids instead.Its still better than AV7, but who isn't."
4,Like Killswitch but better vocals,"Yeah I enjoy Killswitch Engage, however the screaming gets to me. These guys have KILLER harmonies, catchy melodies, and the vocals are a bit edgy at times, however they smooth it out. I especially like All These Things I Hate and 4 Words (To Choke Upon).Get it if you like harder stuff like Avenged Sevenfold, and Killswitch, but are looking for a more original feel."
2,Screamo-metal for mallcore kids,"The Poison was introduced to me by a friend of mine who thought I might like them. The first song was good but,the rest of the album left a sour taste in my mouth. If I had to describe this record I would say it sounds like Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold had a love child. The guitar is actually really good but, the singing is way too emo for my taste. It isn't very original either.You might even think that you have heard some of these songs on other metal records that recently came out.""The Poison"" does have it's moments. I liked ""Spit You Out"" and ""4 Words"" alot. Had there been more metal singing, less emo singing, and a little more originality it might have been worth buying. Instead they just leave you wondering if the same people who created N'Sync created these guys. 2 stars weak"
5,great band,"I have a wide variety of different bands i listen to, these guys are deffinately one of my favorites. There songs dont all sound the same and i like that. When you here them you know who they are."
3,"Ah, the vocals need to be fixed","Solid CD. These guys are talented players and there is a lot of nice things to find here. The intro is well done and the production and pacing of the CD is top notch thruout. Good songwriting keeps things fresh and some good guitar solos that remind me of an eariler time. The only thing that was questionable was the vocals. I know that screaming vocal is the metalcore thing, but if you listen to the songs, some of the yelps just don't fit. This guy can sing and he shows it off at times but feels he must scream on the last measure of each verse? I mean, at least take it easy on the ballads.Other than that, I like this CD. Even an old metalhead can get into it."
5,Forget what you know hear what you don't know!!!,"This cd is infectous it is enjoyable on so many levels of music it is unreal, forget about what any one thinks they know about this band or the trend they would place them in do yourself a favor and listen to the music that is exploding from this band! at any moment in any of the songs this band has the force to drive the song straight thru your skull and have you singing along while your headbanging to the intensity and clarity that is missing in the modern scremo,metal,hardcore world of rock cause trust me its all inside and if your not sure just get the get the EP HAND OF BLOOD cause this thing has some of their best material really find a way to hear this band!! the future is bright for these MetalHeads and i am ready for every beat!"
4,BFMV-Do I Like them!,"I've only just become familiar with BFMV but I have to say there AWESOME!! The screaming is just the right dose for me...The Taste of Chaos tour is coming here soon and I can't wait to see them LIVE!! I can't say anything bad about this CD except that the volume in my car can only go so high...My neighbors too can appreciate the good stuff (SOAD is playin nonstop at there house) so thats not an issue. I was not disappointed with this CD..Great vocals,lyrics and all around good stuff..Which reminds me I have to have more BULLET!!! Who's with me??"
3,"Not bad, but not good","Like the other reviewer said: Mediocre. To me it sounds like another ""emo"" band. I'm sure the emo kids will eat this one up, as Im sure that this is the demographic that the band is aiming for."
5,Excellent job,"Guys did a product which is very very interesting. A lot of drive and energy and beautiful guitar play. Must listen if you like both early Metallica and new stuff (Papa Roach, Ill Nino) ..."
5,Nice!!!,This is a very good album end-to-end. They also show that this is not a production 'fake' in the RockEmRing Live show where they tear it up.
3,"Good, certainly not great","Initially this album kinda blew me away with the production value and nice combination of '80s Brit-style soloing and Swedes-inspired riffage. But unfortunately, the album doesn't stand up to repeat listens. I agree with most of the criticisms I see around here regarding the uninspired lyrics and whiny lead vocalist. However, both vocalists have nice metal screams which alleviates the situation a little bit. And the guitar play is very good, excellent at times. I'd like to say that ""All These Things I Hate"" is one of the worst excuses for a metal song I have heard in my life. Check out the album if you can get it for 10 bucks or less. Otherwise, it's not worth it."
5,Duuuude!! This is Awesome!!,"This album is what my old friend Barney would call ""SUPER-DEE-DUPER"". But seriously, it's really great metal that's hard for other bands to try to mimic. One of my favorite albums to date with my favorites being: All These Things I Hate, Tears Don't Fall, 4 Words, Room 409, and The Poison.Every metal lover needs to pick this one up for sure."
3,About Average,"Bullet for my valentine's the poison is a typical metal album of 2005-2007. A pretty heavy, hard-core screaming/ bass drum pounding album that sounds almost similar to everything else out right now. In my opinion these guys have technical skill with drums, guitar, vocals, bass etc. But sound similar to trivium, from first to last, between the burried and me, avenged sevenfold, and most of the other bands of this genre. It's an ok album, but nothing really original here."
5,"Finally, a band that does new metal the right way.","First off, I'm an 80's metal guy. I love bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Dio, Megadeth. And for years, it's been difficult for me to get into any new metal bands...until now! What an amazing band. Finally, you have a band that has the makings of a great modern day metal band, yet their music still firmly reflects their 80's roots. I love this album. If you love your metal with pounding riffs, killer solos, and a whole lot of attitude, buy this cd. This is the best British rock band to come onto the scene in years."
2,DIANA IN BLANDLAND,"Ms Ross regrets, but here she was doing her legend no favours with dated collection of cliched ballads and lightweight dance numbers. Ballads like Heart (Don't Change My Mind) and When You Tell Me That You Love Me sound like typical album tracks, and the same can be said for the pop-dance numbers such as Change Of Heart and the title track, although the latter does have some nice guitar work. One track grips you and that is Battlefield, but one swallow does not make a season. Diana in blandland."
3,talk about studio force,"Diana Ross is definitely considered a star, and you can't deny the impact her glam look had on her fans and audiences alike during the past decades.You also can't deny the woman ain't got a strong vocal abilty, but what she lacks in voice she makes up with great insights when it comes to choosing composers, writers and producers.This album enlists an amazing number of top lyricists:Will Jennings (Celine Dion), Diane Warren, the Gloria Estefan's team, Stevie Wonder, Terry Britten (Tina Turner)...Too bad that the vocals ain't up to the expectations on such nice tunes (except maybe for WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME, IF WE HOLD ON TOGETHER and the title track).Her cover of Warren's HEART DON'T CHANGE MY MIND simply pales when compared to Barbra Streisand's original version...Yet the duet with Al B. Sure is jazzy and sensual.And the opening track is very very very Diana.And, i repeat this, the production is stellar...so worth buying for that reason for sure!"
1,Didnt work for me,"Have ugly dark circles, nothing has worked. Hoped this would help. Used it for over a month, twice daily. Did nothing. One time I put too much on and it dried my undereyes really bad in the morning.Maybe it works for other, but did nothing for me."
3,no difference,"been using this for a while, haven't really noticed any difference. I guess ppl use eye creams for the psychological effect."
4,Content Review,"If you have an interest in nonprofit organizations and governance, I highly recommend this book. It provides theory and application of tools that can be utilized in any organization. Easy to read and to apply."
4,"Dated, but timeless","If you can get past the testosterone-soaked prose--with many references to the military and no references to women in the workforce--you'll find some timeless principles related to managing time, cultivating strengths rather than fixating on weaknesses, and focusing on the bottom-line contribution."
4,Good compilation of effectrive behavior,Reading this book in the least will cause you analyze and self scrutinize the way you manage your time and efforts in your career. It is a wealth of information and should be slowly digested.
5,Vital tool,This is a fantastic book. It is written in an old-school style that is somewhat hard to get through.....but the messages are very clear. This book totally changes the way you think about your role in an organization - regardless of your rank or profession. It's definitely a book you should read at least twice.
5,Presents an excellent foundation for development of effectiveness,Very clear concepts with real examples that apply on any large corporation executive. A must read for anyone looking for self-development.
2,Not a good buy...,"I recently bought this book expecting to find out all that wasn't accessible online, only to find that it doesn't really say much. The author owned many basenjis, and knew about as much as I did after a few minutes of google searching the basenji. Check out My Smart Puppy, its a general book but its the only thing that I can say relates to, and has helped me with my basenji, Simone."
2,Disappointed,"I was really hopeful that this would work, but it's not great. If you have a short piece of fabric, this will work if you use one long downward swipe. If you're trying to remove hair from a bigger area (like a coat) all it does it gather the hair and then spread it around."
3,It works but....,"not as well as I had hoped. It does not pull hair out of the fabric but it does roll up a lot of what is on top of the fabric. If you have pets, you know what I mean about the hairs with the ends sticking into the fabric. I imagine it might do differently on different fabrics. I have better luck with a regular lint brush and the masking tape stuff."
5,The BEST fur removal tool I've used and it lasts forever,"This sponge is incredibly effective, long lasting, and affordable. It works like a charm and pulls up a large amount of fur quickly. The only thing that equals its effectiveness is lint rollers. Lint rollers don't pick up as much in a swipe and it takes a lot longer to use a roller. The best part is that it lasts forever. The only reason I had to buy a new one is because I accidentally threw my old one away."
2,Did not work for me,"I have multiple cats, and this product did not work for me at all. It just seemed to move the hair around. The hair did not even clump to make it easy to pick up. I cannot recommend this product."
5,Own a Pet?--must have,"I have a long-haired (furry) cat, and this is the best for removing all that hair that sticks! Highly recommended. I gave 5 for Christmas gifts!"
2,Eh,"I bought this to use on my surefit two piece stretch couch cover. It doesn't work. I tried it on my clothes, it doesn't work on those either. Perhaps for carpet or very thick upholstery? It just really grabs a hold of anything I've put it to and kind of ""sticks"" and as you try to drag it it skips. I really gave it a go on both clothing and the couch and it barely moved any hair at all."
3,Its not good,"La verdad no es que funciones muy bien. Pensé que iba a dejarme limpia de pelos cuando lo usara, pero al hacerlo, los pelos continúan en todas partes.This product its not good enough."
1,Gave it a shot...but not so great,"After reading the positive reviews, I thought I would give it a shot. It did not do a great job at lifting pet hair nor cleaning the interior cloth seats of my car. After using it, I would call it a gimmick and not worth the cost."
1,Not as great as the reviews suggested,"doesn't work well on shirts, which is why i bought it. It looks and feels like a heavy sponge. nothing special. Won't buy again."
1,useless,i wipe this over the pet hairs--nothing. trying on clothes is even worse! i don't see how it works for some and not for others but i would not recommend wasting one penny on this. just go over hair with scotch tape and call it a day.
2,Not so good,"I bought this thinking it would easily take cat hair off my furniture, but it doesn't work as well as it says. I wouldn't buy another one."
1,Save your pennies,"Don't buy this product...it stinks (literally), an unpleasant,rubbery, chemical smell. This is a dense mustard-yellow sponge that rolls the picked-up fur into strands that you have to then pick off the sponge and the surface sponged.A much better option is the Pledge Fabric Sweeper. This baby really does work, and you get to see all the yucky fur building up in the clear dome, which you then empty into a waste basket."
3,Not what I hoped for,"A few of the stories within the pages of this book might be of interest if you're looking for examples of combat in the hills and villages of Afghanistan, but keep in mind that they will be very few. This is a small book and most of the stories have to do with the soldiers themselves; thus, if you have an interest in a soldier's imagination, thoughts, dreams, and what he thinks about during the war, their conversations with each other, rather than the raids/battles they might become engaged in, you'll find something of interest within the pages of this book. Otherwise, I'd say give this one a pass. This won't be a book I keep around nor is it something one can readily cite as a source."
1,WRITER'S CRAMP,"After picking up this book at the state library ... I wished I hadn't. Paine is a confused writer to say the least and his short stories refelect that. His stories could have been condensed down to a half a dozen pages, but add up to 20+ of verbiage simply reflecting a writer who likes to hear himself write. O'Henry Mr. Paine is not. If you have never felt you wasted your time reading a book .... then read 'Scar Vegas'."
1,You have got to be kidding!,"I bought this book based upon the (at that time) glowing reviews on Amazon. I found the stories boring (when comprehensible), moralistic and wholly uninteresting. Perhaps I failed to comprehend some oblique deeper mmeaning here--but I doubt it. It was literally a struggle to finish the book. I would definitely skip this one. The worst book I have read in a long time."
5,The variety of stories is breathtaking.,"In truth, if half stars were available, I might have given this collection of short stories 4 1/2 stars, but I still though it was great. The stories were varied not only in their subject matter but in their style of being told, almost to the point where it feels that each story was written by a completely different author. In addition, they range from broad comedy to real tragedy to astute social commentary to everything in between. Quite an accomplishment. My only slight reservation was that, while I considered the second 5 stories to be very good, they were not in my view as uniformly excellent as the first five, which were truly great. In particular, I felt that the ""Unapproved Minutes of the Carthage, Vermont, Zoning Board"" (absolutely hilarious) and ""The Spoon Children"" were the best of the group. Buy the book and enjoy it."
3,The new version,"This tape of The Gathering is the revised version that Straczynski did especially for TNT, with new music and special effects, several new scenes, and several old scenes deleted. It is substantially better than the old version, but completists may want to get the old version, which is available from Columbia House."
4,This isn't the original pilot as the package claims,"I bought this DVD thinking they had finally released the original pilot shown in 1993 (as the package says) with Stewart Copeland doing the music... it isn't. It is the same version as the one included with IN THE BEGINING.Having said this, even if the package is deceptive, it is still a well made murder mystery. It takes you on a tour of the station, and introduces all the characters without too much standing around talking as most pilots have.It is a good start for the series... I just wish it was the original version... my recording of the original pilot on VHS (I took it off the television) is showing it's age!"
3,"Not the best, but still an intriguing start to Babylon 5","This series pilot does a very good job introducing the major alien races, their history with the Earth Alliance, and their diplomats, all of whom will play an important part in the unfolding Babylon 5 saga. This updated, revised edition of the pilot gives a darker, more sinister edge to some of the plot and main characters, most notably, Lieutenant Commander Laurel Takashima (Tamlyn Tomita) and Minbari ambassador Delenn (Mira Furlan). Anyone who expects ""Star Trek"" may be disappointed, since the story is far more complex and thoughtful than almost anything I have seen in all the versions of ""Star Trek"". While this is not ""Babylon 5"" at its best, it offers the viewer much promise, along with tantalizing hints as to what will follow over the course of the five year-long saga."
2,You get what you pay for,"Although the quaility was very poor and grainy (almost looks like a VHS transfer), the movie itself was enjoyable. I'm disappointed though that the disc doesn't even come in a DVD case, its in a cardboard sleeve. On the upside, the cardboard fits nicely in the Season 1 pouch (which brings up my main complaint with the Season 1 DVDs, why wasn't this included in the first place?). Overall good movie experience, but packaging and extras gets a thumbs down."
4,THE GATHERING is full of intriguing hints to a great story.,"The story in The Gathering led us to believe that the future of the earth would not be so very different than the present, as far as the culture and the emotions of humans. The special effects were fantastic. The acting was great overall, especially from Commander Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) who showed us a wide range of expressions and feelings in a very short amount of time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the makeup...but it's possible that I am only comparing that area of the story to the later excellent makeup jobs done throughout the series."
3,Found it hard to follow,"This thing was ok, but for me, hard to follow. It sort of seemed a bit disjointed. Dispite what it says on the cover, Christina was NOT back after Thriller as this Movie was made before Thriller. This would probably be better suited as a rental, as you will probably only want to see it once."
1,Terribly Disappointed,"First off, I agree that the lead actress was attrictive...Big tits and a gorgeous face and body which was often displayed in full frontal nudity....But after that I cannot understand the fuss. The movie is definitely ""R"" by our standards today.(e.g. see the recent Sessions with Helen Hunt).and from a sexual action perspective there was no (simlulated even) oral (MF FM or FF). The simulatd sex scenes were this side of silly and the plot....if I may use that term for this feature was disjointed in the extreme. Give me Japanese soft porn any day of the week, and of course any number of much ""harder"" European features from the 70s through present. Sorry, but for me this was a definite thumbs dowan and a waste of $15."
2,not a good move for Christina Lindberg,"well its me again the celebrity nude hound and big breast fan. this move was just boring all the way around even the nude shots of Christina where not very appealling to me. she had a lot of nude shots in the film but not very sexy to me. and the story line I just didnt get it at all which makes this film a no buy in my opinion. I found the move maid in sweeden to be much more entertaining as far as seeing her naked and a little bit more interesting story line. now the one thing I can say about Lindberg is that she has a great body and dosnt mind showing at all. but for the money I would skip this film and buy either maid in sweeden, Anita: Diary of a Nymphomaniac or Sex & Fury. but if you just want to c her naked you have a lot of films to get including this one which like I said shes seen here a lot. hope this helps."
1,What great trash?,Why would anyone want to listen to this absolute trash has everyone been brainwashed by this hideous creature i cant seem to understand?????????????
3,Yeah Right,"This has to be one of the best CD's I've ever heard in my life. To hear his positive lyrics is a breath of fresh air in hip-hop. I think he is one of the few artists who doesn't have to talk about drugs, guns, and violence. Instead, he decides to use clever wordplay and lyrically draws unbelievable pictures for you to see. Hold on. I'm sorry, I thought I was reviewing Talib Kweli. Oh well, this album is O.K. Mostly hype though."
4,instant classic,"Its definately up there as a great cd...hes hard, he can flow, and eminem and dre drop hot beats...em's flow on #3 ""patiently waiting"" pretty much outshines the rest of the cd tho...50's definately on fire. G-Unit"
1,Can't believe people compare him to Eminem...,"they have nothing really in common other than the fact they both rap and are under 35. At least Eminem is amusing and/or has a message. ""Four bits"" doesn't even have that. If this is what is popular rap nowadays, than maybe there will be a new artist to sweep 50 cent and Ludacris away in the next few weeks. We can only hope."
2,I'm really generous 'cause it's may be rated 1/5 or less!,"Why I give it 2 stars?Because Nate Dogg appear on this cd (Why? I don't know!) and the tracks ""In Da Club"" & ""21 Questions"" are ok. If the remix of the bad the song ""P.I.M.P"" (feat. Snoop!!!) appeared, i thing this album can be better...But the real P.I.M.P (BIG Snoop D.o.gg) is not on this cd and my rate hold on the hand of Nate Dogg who is the saviour of this album.Dre may put a Westcoast rapper and it's Nate Dogg who rap in this lp.A question:Why Dre loose the Westcoast style and join the east coast style?Dre may publish an another cd like 2001 to stay what the legend say on him..."
2,Honestly...,"I gave 50 Cent an honest chance. I tried to like him. But listening to this CD, I was just lying to myself. I knew all along when I first popped in the CD, that this SUCKS. Now In Da Club, the smash hit, is a good song. Its along the quality of an Eminem song and holds your interest with nice beats and quick, slick verses. Its just a shame the rest of the CD isn't the same. The rest of the CD is boring, dull, has no great beats (If I Can't has an okay beat though), and just plain sucks. How can people say this guy is better or even as good as Eminem or Dre? He's boring, sings bad, has bad beats, and is always boasting about guns and fights (Wanksta), women (P.I.M.P.), and clubs (In Da Club) just like all the other boring rappers of today. This guy is extremely overhyped, go buy some Eminem or Tupac CDs if you want good hip-hop."
4,GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN IS TIGHT,"THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST LYRICAL CDS I HAVE HEARD IN A WHILE. 50 IS LIVING UP TO ALL OF HYPE THAT HAS SURROUNDING HIM. ALL OF THE SONGS HAVE TIGHT BEATS, AND EVERY SINGLE SONG IS TIGHT. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SKIP ANY SONG ON THIS WHENEVER YOU ARE LISTENING TO THIS CD. IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE THIS CD YOU NEED TO HURRY UP AND GO GET IT."
4,Really Good!,"I'm not the biggest fan of rap music, and I have to admit that my initial reason for buy this CD was for the song, ""In Da Club."" However, I was pleasantly surprised by many of the other songs on the CD, and I'm more apt to listen to those songs rather than just ""In Da Club.""50 Cent in a refreshing addition to rap music whose songs not only make you want to dance but also make you feel many emotions - something that doesn't seem to happen very often with rap music.I would definitely suggest buying this CD if you want to listen to something different. Also, don't let the feud between 50 Cent and the Murder, Inc. crew sway your decision. Just buy the CD for the music and not the drama."
3,gg noobeh,"""and you are one of them people who is looking for someone...""One of THOSE people. You can't spell either."
5,Mike Jones????..... No Whoo Kid,50 Cent came from the street...Whoo Kid keeps it real... search Whoo Kidget street rap...the mixtape way
2,NO WAY!!!,"YOU'LL GET SO ANNOYED WITH THIS ALBUM SINCE IT'S THE CLEAN VERSION, ESPECAILLY ON SONGS SUCH AS ""HEAT"" AND ""P.I.M.P"", BUT IN DA CLUB SOUNDS IN THE EDITED VERSION AS IF THOSE WERE THE REAL WORDS AND WEREN'T CHANGED, WELL THEY WERE!!!!GET THE NORMAL WITH EXPLICIT LYRICS AND THE CLEAN FOR SCHOOL OR WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO BORROW IT OR GUESTS ARE AROUND!!BUY THE CLEAN VERSION AND GET SOMEONE ELSE TO BUY YOU THE UNCUT VERSION!!!"
1,I think the 10th time will do it.,He's been shot 9 times? Why not try one more that way he'll do the whole world a favor.Only for that I give him prompts but not for this garbage.Did I also mentioned his following album sucks even more?
1,Hooooly crap,"This has got to be the biggest pile of trash I've ever heard. I bought this album because of all the hype surrounding it, and because of the fact that Eminem is my favorite rapper and he signed 50. Big mistake. The album is full of uninspired beats, no emotion or humor, no innovation, and its repetetive and dull. You can hear it in 50's slurred voice, he stumbles on simple rhymes that he can't bust (no pun intended...). And that new G-Unit project he's doing is no better. Watching his ""Stunt 101"" video on MTV, its obvious that he's going the wrong way. He releases a debut album, it sells millions based off hype, and then watch: his next album he's bragging about his cars, money, and ho's (in Beg For Mercy). Try some good rap like Eminem or Outkast."
1,Just when I thought rap couldn't sink any lower.......,"Come ON! Is this a joke? Did somebody really allow this album to be released? I can say, with 100% certainty, that there are absolutely ZERO redeming qualities about this CD........NONE! No good beats that require anyone to do anything more than push a few buttons, no good lyrics, and.....wow.......50 cent can NOT rap (and rapping isn't even hard......AT ALL!!) And yeah 50, you got shot 9 times.....oh great! Perhaps I should go buy a gun and finish the job (you'd be even prouder then, dumbass). To anyone who likes this album, I simply ask WHY? No seriously, why do people like this album? I really wanna know; if anyone could find anything good about this album, I'd flush my wallet down the toilet.I hate you, MTV. (by the way, this rating should be zero stars; why isn't that an option?)P.S. Please God, don't ever allow anyone who sucks this much to have a career in music. And if you must, kill me first."
4,"Don't listen to morons, this is good lyrics & phat beats.","The people who said they didn't like this, look at the music they like. 50 ain't the best lyricist out there but he definetly is a bad ass MC. This CD is tight, 90% of the tracks are straight up gangsta, it's not all about rapping super fast like some of you idiots think. 50Cent knows how to flow with the best beats which Dre & Em produce. If U don't like it shut up, u don't know what your talkin about! Go back to your farm towns u ignorant headbangers!!!"
3,"Not Great, Not Bad, Just Average","I won't lay claim to being an expert in Rap music, but I've listened to my fair share, and 50 Cent's effort on this album is just decent. Somewhat harder to understand than most rappers, his sound is not fresh. The rythyms are pretty good, the rhymes mediocre. Some good guests present here (Nate Dogg, Eminem) but nothing about the album is really memorable. I'll listen to this occasionally but it won't be part of my normal rotation. His gangsta life is evident in the lyrics that are understandable. Oh well, what's next..?"
2,The Rap World Has Gone Retarded,"When this is what's hot...that's perfectly clear. The highlight of this album is ""Many Men,"" and most 50 fans hate that particular track. The first single was the weakest track on the LP. ""21 Questions"" is another mediocre radio hit saved by the vocals of Nate Dogg, while ""P.I.M.P."" is another pseudo-Southern hit saved by Snoop Dogg's indestructability. The rest of the tracks just kind of blend into each other. The beats are nice to listen to, while not very original. The rhymes are even less so. Save yourself the money and the trip to the record store, download the singles, and wait for the next peon to come along."
1,How does this garbage get recorded?,"Enter quite possibly the world's most unintelligent human being. Now turn him lose on a microphone, and play his verbal garbage over any hit radio station at least once an hour. Who decided that this idiot's nonsensical ramblings had to be recorded to ensure that every 120lb caucasian male in North America dress in XXXL clothing in order to appear tough? The ""rapping"" over the atrocious attempts at creating rhymic music is pathetic. I only wish ""Fiddy Cenn"" could understand integers, so I could give his sorry ass -5 stars."
2,"Unoriginal, Uninspired","""In Da Club"" is a fun song to dance to. And that is where the fun of this album ends. 50 Cent's rap style has been done before (I-20, anyone on the Cash Money label). The only reason his hit song is catchy is because it sports an awesome beat created by someone other than 50 Cent. Of all of the famous rappers I have heard, 50 Cent has the least talent by far. Everything he says sounds grumbled and there is no change in the tone of his voice. In addition to his lack of talent, his lyrics are poor. There is neither depth, nor substance. Nobody will ever care what 50 Cent raps about. All they want to hear is the beats.I gave this album 2 stars only because the beats are generally pretty good, but 50 Cent had nothing to do with them."
1,give me a break,50 Cent is the worst rapper of all time. He can't rhyme or tell a story. anyone who thinks he's good is either 5 years old or dosen't know what real rap is. he's been around for years. where have you people been. eminem could have picked anyone and you idiots would like whoever it was. If eminem said the moon was made of cheese most of you people would probably believe him. this album is a joke.
4,"Yeah, yeah...","I don't give this album 5 stars, because 50 can do it better (or he at least did better on ""Guess who's back""). So I waited more from this album, but yeah, it's good. Dre's beats we're good here, like always. And all the haters: If someone's (50 Cent) mainstream, doesn't mean that he's not good. That's just what you punks don't seem to understand."
2,WTF is this Crap....,"Ok only two good songs on this entire disk. Patiently waiting, and In da club ( but that was quckily played out ) The rest of the songs are crap, and like others have said, you cant understand what he is sayin. Basically because he mumbles everything. Here is another ""POP"" artist like Eminem. What is happening to music these days. Since when did, Jay Z, 50, Ja, Nelly become rap? Music like this gives Hip HoP such a bad name. Thank god for Westside connection, and all the Hip Hop artist out there!"
2,WAYYYY TO OVERRATED,"50 Cent doesnt have that much talent what so ever in rapping. I have no idea why hes so popular, there are only a few good songs on this CD which are probaly In Da Club because its catchy, P.I.M.P. because it has a good beat, and Patiently Waiting because Eminem is in it. If you listen to 50 he has no flow or rythym and hes just boring, unlike Ludacris or Eminem who bring style into their songs and sound different in all their songs. 50 has no good dance beats on this CD so I am puzzled on why this guy is so big maybe people will learn. O yeah he didn't get shot 9 times its all part of his big tough guy from the hood image."
2,"agree with the ""garbage"" comments","i really and truly do not see what all the ""fuss"" was about, 50 has a below average voice for rapping, his lyrics are shallow, but Dre, is behind the beats so you know they gonna be catchy, that is the only thing that saves 50 ."
2,Meh.,"I find 50 to be a decent rapper. I think he is way overhyped however, and dosen't have as much talent as many other less popular rappers. This CDs executive producer was Eminem but you can't compare the two. 50 is a gangster rapper while Em is just an insane rapper. Eminem however, has far more talent then 50 cent when it comes down to lyrics and originality. The only stand out tracks on this album (other than many men) are the ones he's featured on. The rest of them are a bunch of I'll kill you, I'll blow your brains out, smoke a joint, etc. etc. kind of stuff. It's the kind of garbage you hear from a mediocre and uninventive rapper. So unless you really like rap regardless of who or what it is, skip this one, and don't buy into the hype."
1,Two Quarters!,"He's no Biggie & definately no 2Pac, but he's got a new refreshing style to be called his own. I think his voice and lyrical style gives him something, extra that was definately lacking since Tu Pac Shakur and Notorious BIG. He's alright with me, I'm not sure he has staying power though. He definately has those club bangers, and radio hits!"
4,GET THE $$$ BUT DON'T SELLOUT,"...i just finished listening to this album and every single track is a standout!The whole album is a masterpeice.50 cent has outdone himself on the record amd ""maybe"" just maybe it had something to do with Eminem and Shady Records..Eminem once said that 50 was one of his favourite rappers and with Em's production skillz he has put 50 on the road to commercial success, which some people might not like (including me).But anywayz this album has to get at least 4 mic's in the source and if it doesn't i swear never to buy another copy.....Classic album but let's hope shady records doesn't end up being a kiss of death..."
2,OVERHYPED!!!!,"This album is way to overhyped! 50's being called as good as tupac and rakim, he doesn't even touch those guys. It makes me sick, that he can be even compared to them. See 50 as what he is, an average rapper with an incredible producer (Dr. Dre). The beats are solid and pretty good though they aren't Dre's best work. (take a look at the original chronic or snoops doggystyle album for that)This cd is not worth buying. Just burn a copy from a friend i'm sure one of your friends has it. Personally i like more intelligent MC's like Nas, 2Pac, Aesop Rock, Atmosphere, or even some De La Soul and Tribe and i love Outkast. All of those artists have albums that blow 50 outta the water. What has rap come to when albums like this go 6 times platinum, i mean honestly, back in the the 90's when Pac, Biggie, Wu-tang, and Nas were in their prime a record like this wouldn't of gone platinum. Bottom line- just burn a copy! This guy doesn't deserve any more recognition he's just an average MC."
5,50 CeNt Is Da BoMb,"i think dat 50cent is da hottest rapper in da whole world. He knos how ta rap and his songs actually mean somefin. Hes a hot as babe and i fink dat he'll last 4ever. 50cent u rock my world, I LOVE YOU"
1,This cd is,"Doo-Doo! You want to hear some lyrics, listen to someone like Talib Kweli or Mos Def. This dude can't rap. The little girls just see his muscles and go crazy. What a waste of beats."
2,"Em, Dre.......... Why?","All right, I will make this short and sweet. 50 cent as an artist is terrible. He is completely monotone and can anybody really understand what he is trying to say half the time. I'de be better off trying to figure out what Ozzy is saying. The only thing that truly saves this album from complete destruction is the fact that 50 has 2 rap moguls producing his album. Thank god he has Dre and Em producing his album cuz if it werent for them this album wouldnt have sold a tenth of what it sold. I'de even come as far to say that I have lost some respect for Dre for even thinking of working on such a terrible project. I just have to say that if 50 is the future of rap than were all in trouble cuz rap used to be poetic like 2pac or Nas and now its just pop like Justin or Britney. All in all 50 cent's is about the amount i'de pay for this hip hop massacre."
1,You are lying to yourself if you like this,"Come on now. This guy has the most horrible flow, godawful lyrics, and [...]I've ever heard. I honestly can't believe some of you find this GOOD. My god, I could run lyrical circles around this guy any day, any time. [...]"
1,It gets SOOOOO annoying,"I originally gave this CD 4 stars the day after I bought it last summer, but now I can't stand to listen to it!!! The songs get old in about 5 minutes and all the beats start to sound the exact same. And making fun of someone and kicking them when they're already down is really old and tired."
1,"""Oh, but he's real man,he's been shot ,and......""","Did someone hand Ma$e a gun? Geez,you know I suppose that is kinda cool that this guy has all this street cred,and maybe that's what gets some you real gangstas to buy this,fair enough,but what's this b.s. w/ this just being what everyone automaticly assumes they need to buy it now? If you're a G,cool,but if not,your a damn tool. For those of us on the other side of hip-hop taste,it's f'n b.s. that all anyone can say to back up this guy for his lack of any real skill is his history, I mean why don't we just start hauling out inmates and give them record deals? Even if gangsta rap is your thing,this c.d. is horrible,admit it.For gangsta, try Snoop,Dogg Pound,Ice Cube,Mack 10,or W.C.. There's better hip-hop out there,even way past gangsta, for those of you who don't see what the heck this hype is all about,because that's all it is,hype."
1,Garbage,"50 Cent maybe perhaps the worse rapper to ever walk the planet. Seriously, if this guy has a cd and is popular among Americas most brain dead, then I now declare myself as the greatest rapper ever! Hell I can make a cd and say, ""Goo shortie, ittz yur birf day"" HEEEEELP!!!!!! So lets break it down like this. 50 Cents of garbage can not rap what so ever. His lyrics are vauge and bascially sounding like all other class D rappers. This whole ""I so hard, I've been shot 86 times"" doesn't work. His beats seem to be the type that a 12 year threw down on his Kalisawki keyboard. Yo ""Fitttty"" itzz yur birf day, now go away!"
1,Fifty,"I don't like this guy's music very much but it's good to see African Americans with Down Syndrome making the jump into entertainment. This guy could be the Chris Burke of the Afro-American movement. Keep up the good work, buddy! We are all very proud of you!"
4,Great album,"There are a lot of great songs on this CD. 50 Cent's lyrics aren't exactly life changing but he doesn't do too badly. The beats are good all the way through and it's a very solid album with no skits - unless you count the 2 or 3 second intro and the 30 second conversation at the start of 'Heat'.There are a few weak songs, namely 'Like my style' and 'Poor lil' rich' but overal I can listen to the whole album.Top 5 Songs:1. Patiently Waiting feat. Eminem (Em steals the show by far)2. Heat3. What Up Gangsta4. Gotta Make it to heaven5. In Da Club"
2,"All image, no substance","It's obvious 50 has some talent, he is a decent lyricist. The problem is that his image has superceded his talent.All these girls coming on here saying ""ooh ooh, 50 is so hot and he's so good at rap"" you have no idea what you're talking about.50 cent is a decent rapper, nothing more. He is currently hip hop's golden boy because he has something every suburban white kid would die for : Street cred. And I'm talking real street cred on the ghetto streets, not the wild streets of Iowa City or Bergen County.It's very simple. The people who LOVE 50 cent are the worst type of rap fans. Very few hard core hip hop heads who been down from day 1 think he is GREAT. All the suburban white boys and especially the white girls love 50, that's fine. But he's a cartoon character to them, not a lyricist."
1,How do things like this happen?,It is unfortunate that this he is the biggest thing in hip hop. The whole mainstream hip hop scene is lacking tremendously; 50 Cent provides nothing worth listening to. There is not a single track where 50's lyrical ability warrants any respect. The beats are simple and weak: 4 to 8 bar loops used throughout the whole track. The singles from this album were laughable. 50 inconsistently sways from being a sensitive thug on tracks like 21 questions to being a hardcore pimp-type figure in P.I.M.P. 50 is laughable; don't buy this album.
1,COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!,"50 cent????If someone offered me 50 cents to buy this c.d. from me, I'd sell it and give the person change back too!!!!!!Where has all the originality gone?????"
1,over rated,he gained popularity for dissing ja rule......he has no flows and spends most of his time dissing the murder inc. yees....and he always has ashanti's name coming out his mouth(pick on someone your own size!)and i know im not the only one who notices all the 2pac that comes out of his mouth but yet he disses ja who does the exact same thing(ja is wack to)and out all the songs that is on this album there is maybe 3 that doesnt mention ja and the murder inc.(dorks).....would i recommend this album(hell no)its complete garbage....and he needs to get a life and lay off the dissing yee's thing!
3,Good,Not as good as the hype...but still worth buying. Patiently Waiting and Don't Push Me are probably the best tracks on the C.D
1,Terrible,"I can't believe how bad this is, considering Eminem and Dr Dre were the producers. 50 Cent can't rap - his delivery is monotonous and boring, and he mumbles his lines so that you can hardly make out the words he is trying to say. That's actually a blessing, for once you do make out the lyrics you realise that virtually every song is about how rich he is, how many girls he's slept with, or how he's going to shoot you. He has no ideas, nothing new to offer lyrically. At least you would've expected some dope beats from Dre and Em, but they don't deliver on this boring CD - the only semi-decent tracks on the album are ""Wanksta"" and ""You Not Like Me"", neither of which are available on the US version of the album, as 50 chooses to stuff it with filler from his own group, G-Unit. Terrible, stay away."
1,STOP THIS GENOCIDE RAP PLEASE,"WE ARE ONLY 12% OF THE POPULATION (AFRICAN-AMERICANS) I'M REFERRING TO AND THIS CAT CONSTANTLY RAP ABOUT EXTERMINATION OF OUR PEOPLE. GUNS,PIMPS,JEWELRY & MONEY ARE WHAT HE GLORIFIES ,COME ON HIP HOPPERS OPEN YOUR EYES DON'T GET SWINDLED BY THESE G-UNIT CATS THEY ARE VERY VERY VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE HEALTH & WELL BEIGN OF HIP HOP. STOP THIS GENOCIDE RAP PLEASE WHATEVER HAPPEN TO SKILLZ & WITS YO I MISS THE NATIVE TONGUES THUN WORD. INCREACE THE PEACE!ONE LOVE TO DE LA SOUL,TRIBE CALLED QUEST,JUNGLE BROTHERS ,JERU DA DAMAJA,PUBLIC ENEMY,X-CLAN & POOR RIGHTEOUS TEACHERS.MENTAL DEATH IS THE WORST DEATH A MAN COULD WISH UPON HIMSELF."
1,READ THIS IT WILL HELP U ALOT,"Ja Rule if ur reading this don't u dare back down50 cent u need help first of all wat the heck is with ur lyrics i mean c'monTHE ONLY REASON HE IS EVEN GETTING LOOKED AT IS BECAuSE HE GOT SIGNED FROME EM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!50 u tried to get in the rap game but u won't stay famous long with lyrics like""U A POPTART SWEETHART""WAT IS THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!also evidently u watch sesame street if u no who the cookie monster sounds like and who is like.hey 50 let me give u a hint about sumthingTHE RULE WONT DIEstop mumbling tell rule ur srry n rap about sumthing else, n earn urself in to the rap game like ja didDon't pick up this crap pick up any of Rule's cds i like blood in my eyeGet his 1st album or blood in my eye if u weant harcoreGet his others if u want a mixture i would say Rule 3:36 is a good mixtureJa RUle keep doing wat u do"
1,who cant rhyme with bub?,"granted 50's been through a lot, but would he be where he is with out Dre's beats and guest appearances by Em? I most definately think not...bottle full of bub, come give me a hug? get serious! how many times have we had to ""party like its yo birfday""...he's definately not one for originality...i been listening to REAL hip hop since i first saw RunDMC back in '85 and this is almost a disgrace...even for ""gangsta"" sh*t this is crappy...remember NWA and CMW? obviously 50 doesnt...and also, anyone who feels the necessity to type ""da"" instead of ""the"" in a review can hop on ""da"" bus with 50 and take a nice trip out of town...oh, and if y'all(?) think im a hater you're wrong, i dont hate any artist...i just think 50 would be better suited tearing tickets on the train or carrying my bags to my room at the Motel 6...give it a rest playa' fakers, 50 sucks..."
4,50 cent get rich or die tryin,50's album get rich or die trying is pretty good album. Most of the song in it are tight especially don't push me are of the hook. Some people don't gives this album the credit that it deserve it should of sold more in stores. Most of songs have good lyrics and beats like PIMP and Patiently waiting. This CD should be in everyone collection so go out and buy it.
5,~50 Cent~ Get Rich or Die Trying,This album is a must buy 50 is the bomb....its 16 tracks of thugged out street realism....50 is whats HOT!
4,great,"this is a great cd. eminem and dre made a smart choice signing 50 and G unit. this cd comes with the already classics in Wanksta and In Da Club, but the rest of the cd is what makes it great. the whole album as a whole is on par with The Eminem Show, if you wanna compare those. the beats are bangin, obviously, with dre, and 50's lyrics are his normal street rhymes. my favorites trax are Patiently Waiting, and Back Down, which is a diss to biatch Ja Rule. you'll laugh hard at the end of the song. get this album-along with his other underground stuff-you won't regret it. peace"
3,3 1/2 actually,"Yo, 50's album is pretty ill, pretty ill, you know? Eminem's produced tracks are the best and Dre is a genius. All due respect to anyone that put their work on this album. I like most of the songs, but ""Like My Style"" and ""Poor Lil Rich"". BUT, don't believe the hype, because 50 is in no way 2Pac nor will he ever be the next Pac, he just doesn't have the depth and the will to match up to the greatest rapper to ever bless us. The lyrics are too superficial, and are more party tracks (which is cool, when you wanna party). As well, he is low on the list of Shady's best signed, Obie Trice has much more talent and sounds better than 50. And the reason that Em always sounds better than the person who's album it is, is because he always starts off his verse with a way to advertise himself, like in ""Patiently Waiting"" it has all the sound effects that become real intense and his voice sounds other-wordly. Anyway, still a pretty good album, but not Shady/Aftermath's best."
3,Tight,"It's a good album, but kind of disapointing. I was expecting more after ""Wanksta"" and ""In the Club"" came out. Oh well, it's still a good album. Best song: ""Blood Hound."""
5,5O Cent - Get Rich Or Die Tryin!!!,I think that 50 cents newest cd get rich or die tryin is great. He is the hottest thing on the street right now. Everyone is bumppin 50. Get rich or die tryin got alot of cameos and it sounds great its better than Ja Rule!! haha
1,AH HELL NAH CUZ DA BIZKIT IS BETTA,AH NAH DIS AINT GOIN DOWN DA LIMP IS GOT SO MUCH MO GANGSTA FRED DURST IS MO MONEY MO GANGSTA AND DATS FO SHO HOMEY MY NIGG 50 CENT AINT GOT NO FLOW AND HE AINT NO GANGSTA HE WAS RAISED IN THA HILLS OF BEVERLY AND DATS A FACT. DA BEATS IZ WHACKA DAN MOST IN DA RAP GAME .GO LISENZ TO THREE DOLLA BILL YAL YO YO JA RULE IS DA TRUE GANGSTA AND DATZ FO REAL CUZ .YOUZ BETTA NOTZ DIS MY REVIEW OR ELSE YOU WILL BE SORRA
1,worst CD I've ever heard,"50-cent sucks. He just plain sucks. Classical music is better than this junk. rap is bad no matter who's singing. 50-cent is a gay over shot loser who has other people create songs for him to sing and get rich off of, while the designer of the song get 5%. all rap is the same. People just sing blurred words, that would rhyme if you could hear them. Nothing special. In contrast, a rock band actually plays an instrument and sings words you can hear, understand, and sing along to. if you want good music buy a Green Day or U2 CD. It's just my opinion but, I'M RIGHT! 50-CENT SUCKS.3 reasons why you should not buy this CD:1. 50-cent is isn't talented, he doesn't play an instrument.2. 50-cent is hated so much that hes been shot 9 times.3. He raps so bad he needs to play his backround music louder than his voice so that nobody can hear his voice.I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND BUYING THIS CD."
3,Average @ best...,"I have to say... this was the most hype I've heard about an album in a long time. I have it, and it doesn't impress me much. There are a few tight songs here, my favorites being Patiently Waiting, In Da Club, Back Down, and 21 Questions. Everything else is pretty average... I will say he's had a hard time, but to compare this to Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and Ready to Die? No, no... those are CLASSICS... this is not a CLASSIC by ANY means... it's good to have because it's hot, but will they be talking about Get Rich or Die Tryin' the way they are the aforementioned albums 10 years from now?"
4,He Has Talent,"I think that this album does live up to the hype. I feel that 50 Cent is talented. All Hip Hop doesn't have to be the same. If you like Common, The Roots, or Jurassic 5 you may not like this artist. If you're into club music and songs with very well produced music then you'll like 50 Cent. He has catchy lyrics and a nice baritone voice. I like 80% of the album. It was a very good effort."
2,whyyyyyyyy... do people buy this? ...,"Rap is a style of music that came up very quickly, and why? Because its rediculously easy to make and people are stupid enough to buy it. I have a computer that can play a beat, and I can talk in rhymes for about three or four minuets, if I wasn't white then I could be a big rap star to.Yes this guy is angry which shows he has at least some emotion, but its still something that everyone without stage fright can do.I gave him an extra star because the computer he uses did make at least some good beats. If it werent for his ""singing"" they would almost be decent space fillers."
2,Mase Wanna Be.,"He OK, But He's Not That Bad.He sounds Like Mase.He sholdn't on Eminem's Lable, because his lyrics are not powerful.Anybody produce by Eminem should have TIGHT lyrics like Eminem"
1,50 cent more like 50 poor,"50 cent is poor lets face it the only good songs he has done are how to rob and its your birthday the rest are poor. e.g 21 questions and pimp those are the two most comerical girly songs eva he shud be ashamed of himself whata looser. every1s like 50 cent hes the biggest thing to come out well all i hear about this poor is how many times he got shot liek i give a dam.he hasnt produced an album which is close to that of real hiphop legends like biggie,snoop,nas maybe you should all stop going along with the public.if 50 cent did a poo on a record ud probably think it was good cos a bunch fo 12 year olds are singin along to it in the street. you guys make me sick all of you why dont you go listen to black eyed peas aswell or maybe b2k you loosers. get a good music taste this album is pooooorrrrr"
1,"In the land of the deaf, the man with one ear is king",If I was you Id click on Dr Dre and get both the Chronic albums instead.other albums that are betterMakaveli-the Don KiluminatiSnoop Doggy Dogg-DoggystyleNWA-Straight outta ComptonTha Dogg Poung-Dogg FoodIce Cube- Death CertificateNotorious BIG- Ready to DieListen to those and then compare if fiddy is a lyricists.
1,There is a God.,"Martin Luther King gets assinated in one try while this guy, a drug-dealing gangbanger and general punk, survives nine bullets (or was it shootings). That just shows you there's justice in the world.And, oh yeah, this guy can't rap."
5,Too lazy too fill out the thing so i clicked kid's review,"50 has a unique style... he's not really that lyrically impressive, but he just comes so hard on his stuff that you're impressed anyway. Let me just say that this CD is better than the massacre, but that doesn't mean that the massacre isn't good. The massacre has it's good Cuts, like: In my hood, Gatman and Robbin, and God gave me style. No matter what 50 couldn't top this CD anyways. This CD was in instant classic. Every song has good beats, and 50 knows how to work with em. Best songs are the dre beat ones of course: In da club, Blood hound, and if i can't. If you want a CD too bump in your car then this is definitely it. I suggest getting this before the massacre... the massacre seems to be geared more towards the ladies.. songs like: Build you up, Just a lil bit, Candy shop, amazing lead me to believe it. Anyways they're both Good Cd's and definitely pick up The G UNIT Cd and maybe banks and bucks CD's too."
1,Get Talent or Try Dying,"Rap died a long time ago, but THIS is ABSOLUTELY the bottom of the barrel. The person on here I pity most is the Amazon.com reviewer, who said that there's no, and I quote, ""fast-forward material here, a near miracle in these times."" Oh really? I don't know what copy of this CD YOUR younger sibling played on 4 hour car ride when you forgot your own headset/other CDs, but the one I heard had no tracks worth listening to. I don't know what about rappin about gettin shot and gettin women over produced beats and synthed melody makes a song great, but Amazon.com (and many other people who critique music for a living) really needs to have higher standards for grading rap music. And no, I don't hate 50 simply because he has gone commercial or b/c everyone knows his name; there's some good radio music out there, but every genre of music suffers from those one or two way-overhyped icons. In rap, they are Nelly and 50 Cent (others are overhyped, but not like these two are/were)."
1,He been shot NINE time!,"This album is wack, yo. Hip-hip by the numbers with an emcee who can't rhyme and radio-friendly fodder like '21 Questions' but it don't matter, cus HE BEEN SHOT NINE TIME!I've heard better 'music' at the National Zoo (primate house) but it doesn't matter. No, it doesn't matter one bit. You'll buy this garbage because 50 CENT BEEN SHOT NINE TIMES!"
3,psssssshhh.,"Damn man ""50 cent"". WHA! I heard this album, and it aint nothin but AVERAGE. I have hear nelly albums like this (damn that is bad) He is strictly pop, dre aint fallen off, but this guys was never on top. he has great ppl feeaturing, but he is more of a hippocrit than Jah (rule (the fool). He is a wannabe rapper, stay on the block 50ty? yeh sure, i would do the same, its just about money right? Hip pop sells more. If y'all want some real hip hop then check out J-LIVE, TUPAC, DEAD PREZ, METHOD MAN. and old school NWA. This guys is for all the people who watch too much t.v and believe in the hype, even i did, but the rapper has only got a few hot joints, he repeats himself, watch his next album, it'll be the same. AVERAGE."
1,The backstreet boy of gangsta rap.,"I have no respect for this type of rap music. There is no message, no flow, nothing. It's 100% image. You could kick a typewriter down a staircase and come up with better rhymes than this fool."
1,"I'm starting to miss Britney, NSYNC and Ja Rule!","I used to think Oops I Did It Again, Bye Bye Bye and Always On Time were bad and annoying but compared to this ""Music"" the songs and artists I just mentioned are classics! 50 Cents is so monotone even ma$e has more character in his rhymes. So what if hes from the hood? At leased keep a positive message for those still tryin to make it. All this album does is keep the hoods violent. Do we really need more violence in the streets?"
1,What's happened to Music? :(,"Remember when music was about emotion? Well in case you don't, heres a hint.. life is not about prostituting women, being a pimp, getting rich, and being shot 9 times. His music has no feeling, its all an image. IMAGE! Doubtful any of you can relate to this. It's fluffy, somewhat catchy garbage fed to you by the media, and none of you know any better than to take it for the gospel. Please proceed to run far, far, away from 50 Cent the street-worn Gangster, sitting pretty in his billion-dollar mansion, and take a look at what a sucker would buy this crappy music."
1,i hate 50 cent,"i'm a punk rock fan myself and i respect rap as music i guess but this is not even rap. this my friends is trash. this man is a drugged out loser who thinks he's the greatest. what the heck is a ""birf day"" or a ""showtee."" this guy couldn't sing or dance so he decided he'd talk into the microphone. i dont undrestand how this loser sold any records and i urge you not to by them."
1,This album isn't even worth 50 cents,"This album is just about the worst load of manure to ever come out of anything. I don't even own it. I heard it on the radio once or twice. Seriously, the grunts people make while taking a large crap would make for better lyrics than 50 cent comes up with. From the way he sounds, you'd think it was the motor control center in his brain had been shot. I mean seriously! He sounds like he's retarded! If this guy has really been shot 9 times or whatever, his enemies must be godawful shots. Just give me a gun, and I'll finish the job. Or maybe I'll kill him slow. He deserves it."
2,call it what ya want but...,"this cd is not all its cracked up to be. sure everyone loves the infectious beats thanx to dre and em but what does 50 really have to offer? his lyrical content is mediocre at best and he seems to be sweating one particular thug of the past...2pac. ""i want them to love me like they love pac""...uh no. also check out the ""hail mary"" joint with em, busta, and 50...isnt 50's verse just a bit too reminiscent of pac??? sorry 50 but you aint the new 2pac. 2pac had much more to offer than thug appeal and tight beats. im not mad at 50 for getting his cash but stop riding the 2pac/""im a thug too"" train. call it what ya want...im a hater or whatever but i smell alot of ""hype-nitis"" in here."
1,"Yo, I'm a straight up gangsta, yo!","Yo, I be BUMPIN' my man Fiddy 'cause his beats be slammin', yo! This jawn right hurr iz tight, son! I talk like this 'cause I'm an idiot and my fellow idiot friends wouldn't respect me anymore if I talked like a normal human being, dawg! I don't want to be my own person 'cause talking like an uneducated fool is cool, yo! I'm a sheep and I'll continue to be a sheep until I'm 40 or I get killed by some wannabe gangsta who will cry like a little girl when he's sent to jail for life, yo!"
2,The Most overted album ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok, first off 50 cent raps like a machine bumbbling u cant even here what he is sayying!!! His lyrics are so terriable and old, how can people comare him to the thug poet 2pac!!! I gave this albumb 2 stars cuz dr. dre put some ok beats. That was the only reason this ablums sells people, the beats. From the incrediable Dr. Dre. This ablumb is full u cathy hooks and beats that make the albumb sell. I do not recomend this albumb for real Rap fans maybe po fans. Liten to some 2pac and u will see the difference betteween rap and pop.[]"
1,50 has no talent... period...,"anyone who could give this CD more than 3 stars knows nothing of hip hop... i'm sorry, they just can't. Granted, Dr. Dre can supply some really good beats, but anymore they're not much more than party beats, which he gives to horrible ""lyricists"" to butcher.50 Cent has no talent...if you really want good hip hop, check out artists like Del The Funky Homosapien, Mr. Lif, Jedi Mind Tricks, Nas, Jurassic 5, The Roots, Eric B. & Rakim, the list goes on.this kind of music is only made to be sold to suburbia so the real hip hop generation will lose sight of it's past and what hip hop is really about."
5,great album,one of the best hip hop albums because he lived what he was rapping at the time and his song writing ability is unequaled.
3,Pretty good,"Most of the tracks are pretty good, or at least o.k. All the ""gangsta"" b.s. seems rather silly and cliche but, that aside, GRoDT is a solid hip-hop album. (Personally, however, I think the best parts were by Emenem.) If 50 grows up a little bit, I think he could put out a lot of good material."
1,awful,"Throw dis in da trash, I'm lucky I got this as a present, 3 cents makes Vanilla Ice look like a rap God!"
4,"Great album, not his best....","I bought this album after all the hype, and its lived up to its expectations. Compared to his first album, Guess Who's Back, it barely misses the mark. Although, you cannot doubt 50's lyrical ability and Em and Dre's production, you have to bang this album! Most rap albums have 2 or 3 hot tracks, and this album comes through with a mix of 12+ banging songs. The last 3 songs off of the album are from his first record to give you a sample of the 'greatness'.The Bonus DVD is an insight into his life and how he came to be. If you buy this album, you will not be disappointed, and his style is a refreshing change from the current game. All I have to say is pop the CD in, and turn it up!"
1,50??lol,"beats nice,lyrics.....WACK,horrible don't pick up this...cdthe only good song is #19,but there r no others"
3,ggggggggg-unit?!?!?!?,"gggggggggg-unint!!!!!.....NOT, ok now what's so special about this album that's so different than his other albums? the only thing different is, this album is not as hot as his other albums. this album gets easily annoying, easily overplayed, and is highly overrated. thats all 50 is, annoying, played out and overrated. wanksta is from like last year and they played it out, same goes for in da club, and the rest of his s*it on this album is overrated. but, some tracks on this album are hot, such as... many men, patienally waiting, if i cant, back down, bloodhound, and dont push me. everything else is not as good at all. this album gets played out real fast quick, so if u dont got it, then your lucky...g-unit it one of the hottest things out now...."
2,50 Cent is not the underground king!,"How could he make that statement in a song? Half the time you can't understand what he says. Cause he mumbles when he rhymes. Also, H-E-L-L-O!? You just signed a major deal with Eminem, one of the most popular acts in music! Your no longer underground. There are only 4 songs on this CD I like:1.What Up Gangsta2.Patiently Waiting3.Don't Push Me4.Wanksta"
5,Get Rich Or Die Tryin 50 Cent,Yo this album is a classic 50 Cent brings da heat. This album is gangsta. A great debut album. 50 Cent Gangsta Rapper1)N/A2)4/53)4/54)4/55)4/56)5/57)5/58)4/59)4/510)4/511)4/512)3/513)4/514)3/515)4/516)4/517)4/518)5/519)5/5Top 5 Songs1)Many Men2)High All The Time3)Heat4)U Not Like Me5)Lifes On The Line
1,Don't believe the hype,"How can people buy into this? 50 cent is not a skilled musician, and does not put forth anything groundbreaking here. I think he should go pick up his GED and enroll in a community college, becuase rap is dying and people like this cannot last.WOW! HE WAS SHOT A FEW TIMES AND LIVED! I NEED TO SPEND MY HARD EARNED $20 ON THIS WORTHLESS CRACK SMOKER!"
1,I'd give it a zero if I could.,"Rappers have no talent what so ever. Why can't any of you people see that? And no im not one of those stupid kids who listens to death metal like all this modern music (...).Real music is Rock from the 70's and late 60's.Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin really found the point of music. And no this isnt a racial thing, Jimi Hendrix is black, and hes one of my favortie musicians. Not to mention he was a hippy, and one of the greatest guitarist of all time.My theory is this whole rap phase will end just like in the 80's with Hair Metal and 60's with the Psychedelic era. Each phase started its own culture, excatly like rap, and died within 5-9 years. Rap will be dead soon, and classic rock will return,FOR GOOD!"
4,good but .......,this is a great but 50 cent just swears alot so the clean version sucks cuz the eriting takes out a few words that arent even swears. So if u are looking for a good album get this but just not the clean version. I by accidentaly got the clean version :( LOL anyways trust me
4,Quit hating on fiddy...,"This is a great debut album. I would't go as far to say 50 is in the ranks of pac and biggie, in fact he's no where near them but don't hate on fiddy for doing what he's doing. this is great album. i'm not going to make the call on a masterpiece i'll wait till his next album to do this. but this is a good album to listen to and jam to. i can only say that you will not be wasting your money when/if you buy this cd. go pick it up, the lyrics are up to par and of couse the beats are the best [dre did them], so if you don't have it by now, you missing out, don't do that to yourself, cop it ASAP."
4,Stop dissin a decent Debut CD,"... Even though this is not the best hiphop debut CD ever made it's still a very well produced CD.... I'm not a real fan of gangsta (that's why only 4 out of 5) but 50 cents effort is defiantly good at bringing it to the next generation.In my opinion Pac was good for his time, biggi though, I would have preferred not to have ever heard if I could of. But you have to remember that there music became huge in the early nineties, now hiphop is evolving you can't expect the same old tunes from 10 years ago coming out, that's what makes this CD so good as it is trying to evolve the gangsta genre.What I suggest to any hiphop/rap lover is to listen to the CD yourself and make your own opinion wether to buy it or not.Don't forget everyone has there own taste.P.S for some real, true Hiphop listen to some Hieroglyphics stuff (Souls Of Mischief, Deltron 3030, Del). Peace"
4,Good but waaay too much hype,"This album is tight but way too much hype. I know 50 cent is doing his thing and I wont hate on him for that. I think this cd has its strong points then its weak points. But my favorite tracks are ""what up gangsta"",""many men"" and ""dont push me"". overall this cd is alright. i really love the beats in this album. If you love the hype then get it.....iight peace."
5,50 cent is the best rapper ever.,"This cd is the best I ever heard. Every song is great, from start to finish. The best songs are Blood Hound, P.I.M.P., Many Men, If I Can't, and Don't Push Me. 50 cent is the next big thing!"
3,"forget about 50 , he does not even know how to rap.","50 cent is truly very overrated.I mean he is just another newcomer rapper like Fabolous who can't rap.But i admit that the production of the album good but 50 cent bring it all down with his lazy vocal.The stand out songs on this album are many men(wish death), in the club and 21 Questions.While the others are just sort of crap.overall, 50 cent is just another rapper who got lucky with the help of Dr. Dre and Eminem or he would still be another unknown chap."
2,Too weak,"I Know that 50 cent is the new thing of rap, but this cd is too overhyped and overrated for my taste, 50's raps were weak and predicable and the only reason people listen to this album are the media themselves, I Understand 50 cent been shot 9 times, but come on this isn't that good eitherSorry 50 better luck next time.I Give him 2 stars for trying."
4,diz be bangin !,i think 50 cent iz a good rapper!he is really good.i saw his performance at the mtv music awards wit the king of rap snoop dogg(snoop dogg is betta den 2pac-and thats the truth).theres sum downfalls doe.like sum songz arent good.but most r good so by dis if u liked his singlez in da club and p.i.m.p dos are my fav songz.GET DIS BLAZIN CD IT ROX AND ALSO GET OTHER 50 CENT CDZ HE ROX!thatz my word.peace.
1,Bad Gangster Rap That'll Make Your Kids Behave Badly,"Gangster rap, heavy metal and violent videogames are the reason why our children are violent and there are so much violence it todays schools. This cd features killing, violence, and it will turn your nice normal kid into a violent, gangster type kid, and its been proven by the MAVV."
2,Ehhh..more MTV rap,"Well, another underground legend has been ruined. 50 used to be cool, before everyone and their brother listened to him. This cd is pretty much mindless dribble, sounding exactly like all the other rappers MTV loves. Heat's a good song and so is Wanksta. The 3 bonus tracks are the best but they should have included How To Rob."
5,get rich or die tryin,this is the best alubm there is. hot tracks like in da club pimp and back down my favorite song.there is a movie coming out with the same cd name cool.also 50 is the best rapper there is respect him. i rate this cd 5 stars
1,50 Cent is sexist,"He is sexist (have you ever noticed that on P.I.M.P, women are fanning his bed?) and cannot sing, I'm not even sure if he can even sing judging by his songs. Eminem is such a brilliant artist, he shouldn't have featured on this terrible cd."
4,New And Hot,50 Cent really shows that he has alot of skills and future potential. Gettin with Dre and Eminem really helped his sound. The cd has accouple of hot club bangers! Hopefully we'll see alot more a 50 cent in the future!
3,not what i expected but ok,i recently bought 50's album cause he was played every other song. when i got home and listened it wasnt what i expected. it weasnt amazing song after amazing song like i expected but there was some good songs
2,Definitely overrated,"With all the hype about 50 Cent, people have overlooked the content of his CD. Lyrically he's about as gifted as Shaq. Statements like ""My flow's been hot for so long"" just don't seem to work for him. Get some real stuff like 2Pac's ""Better Dayz""."
1,i'd rather listen to pumps and a bump,man this stuff is wack. vanilla ice had more phat beets then this poser. too bad he wasn't shot a tenth time and died.
4,50 cent is an amazing rapper!!!,"I dont like rap, but I do like 50. He is an amazing rapper. His lyrics are great and strong. Best song on here is ""Many Men""."
