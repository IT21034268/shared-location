4,Major Kudos,"Mr. Sobell has written another beautiful book on Linux! I first read his ""A Practial Guide to the Unix System"" and loved it. ""A Practical Guide to Linux(2E)"" is also masterfully written. I come from a strong Windows/Sys Admin background. Recently, my company asked me to support Unix/Linux too. I found most books dificult to grasp and hard to read. Mr. Sobell's clear and deep understanding of Unix/Linux shines through in his book. It's a joy to read a Linux book and actually understand what's being said. I can't thank Mr. Sobell enough for writing it and helping me to have a deep understanding of Linux."
4,Excellent book for all users,"This is one of my favorite books for Linux. It lists many commands regulary used by most users and a bunch of advanced and more rarely used commands that are interesting. It's pedagogical and has good language. I recommend this one for everyone who needs a bit more information about linux, the filesystem, some coding-utilities and much more."
5,Perfect Linux for power users or system admins,"One can read this book cover to cover, but it equally impressive as a reference. I find myself constantly going back to it for commands and shell programming references. If you are afraid of the command line, then get this book and learn."
5,Sobel's books are always a great read,"I enjoyed this book greatly as all Sobel's books. He does not describe things, but writes about them. This books was like a journey into a Linux world."
4,"Good resource for Mac users, too!","Even if you're in love with Mac OS X and not planning to switch over to Linux full-time, this book may still be useful for you. Since OS X is built on Unix, and Linux is (as they say) Unix-like, the two operating systems have a lot in common. The file structures are similar, and most command line utilities work the same on a Mac as they do on a Linux distro. I've yet to become a command line power user, but I've already learned some handy tricks for manipulating my files and programs (both in OS X and in Ubuntu on my Virtual Box).So if you're a Mac person who's been wondering what that weird ""Terminal"" application is for, take a look through this book. But you may want to first just borrow it from a friend or the library before you decide you need to keep it on your shelf permanently."
4,Good for Newbies who want to Program,I found this book to be very understandable. I have no experience with Linux but I was writing scripts without any trouble.
3,Love CD Player,"I love this CD player, particularly because the buttons are easy to find in the dark, and it is simple to operate. Unfortunately, I have had some problems with it, therefore want to order a new one. When the CD is first getting started, the sound is garbled, and goes out. Have to twist the imput cable to get it working..as it goes further into the CD, it works fine, other than temporarily just stopping. I have tried to reorder this CD player, but everyone says it is no longer available. Any ideas?"
4,No Radar Involved,"When I was a kid, a local TV station would show episodes of movie serials on Saturday afternoons. This was one of them. Not the best of the Rocketman series, but I'm glad to have this childhood memory. A good transfer makes the experience more tolerable. :-)"
2,"Good movie, bad DVD","I like watching some of these old science fiction flicks. ""Radar Men from the Moon"" is one of the better ones. Sure it's cheesy, but fun.I bought this 3-disk DVD collection since my VHS version is wearing out. The reproduction isn't bad, but I doubt that this is remastered. I have two main gripes with this set. You have to be fast to make your choices on the menus. If you don't select your choice within about 30 seconds, you will have to open and close the disk drawer to start all over. Finally, once I got to the episode page and chose play all episodes, I found that the series started with episode 2. Episode 1 follows 2 and then plays the remaining episodes in order on the first disk. I haven't played disks two or three to see how they work. I doubt that these problems are with my DVD player since all of my other disks play without problems.I gave this review two stars because I like the series, as for the disk collection, it rates one star."
1,Radar Men From the Moon DVD,"Don't waste your money. The entire twelve chapters were awful. If this dvd title was re-mastered, a monkey must have been at the controls. Wouldn't recommend to no-one."
2,Not the greatest fit ...,"I am keeping it only because I'm already out my shipping dollars and it's not worth the trouble of returning it. It does not fit my brand new C331 nearly as well as I would have expected. And the mic hole at its bottom is on the wrong side, so I'll have to punch my own hole in the right place. I should have bought a true no-name for 1/4 of the price on eBay ... Next time I will."
4,Nice product,"This is the first camcorder that we,ve owned. I read a lot of reviews on this and other brands. Setteled on this one and have been happy with it so far. It's easy to use even for a 67 year old novice. I,m happy with the picture quality. Will probably get a tripod to use with it especialy when zooming in, although I used it on a 3 hour walk through Corkscrew swamp boardwalk here in Florida and was able to get some good vidios with and without zoom and very minumum movement. Was able to view the pictures on the TV and computer. Was able to download them onto the computer, and have done some edeting etc., still learning the program."
4,Great little camera,"I love this little camcorder. I am very pleased with the size and the ease of use. Picture quality is great as long as you don't use the RCA cables. Indoor quality with marginal lighting is so-so but I can't say that I have ever seen a camcorder that works really well in low light. Once complaint that I do have is that the camera does not have a very wide field of view. Other than that, I love it."
2,Only good for brightly lit or outdoor scenes,"I purchased this camera to upgrade from using a digital camera for video clips. However, I have unhappily now learned that our little Cannon SD-400 Elph works comparatively great with indoor lighting and this camcorder doesn't. The only way to record indoors with normal indoor lighting is to use additional lighting to light up the area you would like to record. I'm unsure if another camcorder would work better (outside of a professional model) or if technology just hasn't caught up to our expectations yet. I'm sending this camcorder back for a refund and will wait a few years to see if things improve. Beyond the dismal indoor lighting performance, it appears to be a nice little camcorder. If you are only interested in recording outdoor daylight events it should suit your needs."
4,Great Camera,- Amazing camera in terms of picture quality.. though not good in dark rooms.- I ordered twice.. first one was getting heated up so I returned it. Tried GS320 which was is no way match to this one. Couldn't find anything better than this... so ordered it again. Heating problem is gone. Probably it was with the previous piece only.- Still pics are OK ..
3,like the size.,the size is good. the battery makes it seem not so small when it sticking outta the back but i guess you have to have that. i will say that it zooms out plenty but you have to back up to see stuff sometimes. also when you scroll through the menu it takes a while to get to the next section. we live in a fast world! i wasn't happy with that. great camera for the price other then that.
4,"Bad Company, Great Concert!","Even though this isn't the ""Original"" line-up (I knew that when I purchased the dvd), I did enjoy this. A lot! The songs themselves are so excellent, the playing and performance of each band member is top notch. Paul Rodgers not only looks better than I remembered, but sounds better too! His voice is still the best and he remains my favorite singer.The sound quality of this dvd is great, the extras (interviews, backstage) are wonderful. A very well put together dvd sure to satisfy the fans. I only wish the ""Original"" Bad Company had decided to record a live concert when they re-united a few years ago. That would've been a dream come true! To date there has never been an ""Original"" Bad Company live release, in any format. It's a bit sad."
5,Bad Company Still Kicks [rear]!,"Being a loyal fan of one of rock's biggest solid blues-rock bands, I must admit the first time I heard Bad Company in the 70's I was blown away, and now in the New Millenium, they still blow me away. Cudos to Paul Rodgers, one of rocks best lead vocalists. If you haven't seen them in concert, buy the DVD, if you have, buy the DVD and relive some of the greatest moments in rock history."
2,Great DVD but wish it was the original band.,I was skeptical listening to this for the first time like the previous writer. I thought the band sounded good all around.The thing is with this DVD is every time you look at the guitar player you just wish that Mick was still in the band.You just can't take the original guitar player away from a band and expect it to be the same. This is worth buying though if you are a Bad Company fan.
1,milly vanilly,"i dont know how all these people can say this is a great concert dvd,almost every song paul rodgers sings he turns over to the audience to sing the best parts.the songs dont even come close to how the original recordings sound.you could tell he had the ability to but he must of felt it was okay to give the audience a lack-luster performance...very sad totally disappointed.kinda reminds me of milly vanilly where sombody else sang for them."
3,Sleepy set,"First off Paul Rodgers voice is superb and his stage presence is unmatched. Contrasting this is Dave ""Bucket"" Colwell. While he is visually a dead ringer for Mick ralphs, his playing reminds me of my Bad Co interpretations while learning the guitar. There doesn't seem to be a rawness to this performance. Great moments and some not so great. Watch first before you buy."
5,UN - FLIPPIN' - BELIEVABLE,"Okay, well I AM an older customer - who remembers Bad Company playing on the radio in the Datsun 280ZX ... but if this one doesn't get you going ... you be deceased. Incredible."
4,Classic category but lacks magic !,"...It makes a lousy video to hear the crowd sing.overall this is an enjoyable DVD.If you are a BadCo fan, buy this.You may have small disappointments like the one I have mentioned.Paul still sounds great.Original Line up might have made the music sound better.I loved the Packaging,the song selection,picture and sound.Buy It!..."
5,a nicely written book,"this book presents synchronicity in a non-technical, easy to read format...reading the stories makes us appreciate our interconnectedness with the rest of the cosmos giving us a reason to hope and not to despair..."
1,Garmin 12/24 volt cable w/ external speaker,"Extremely poor design and is of very poor quality. This product is a power cord for a GPS that cost $1,150. Unfortunately, to use the GPS you have to purchase a new one periodically, since the only other alternative is to purchase a new GPS. They don't last very long. Garmin should send us new ones at no cost."
2,It works but...,"The power cord works, but there is a design flaw. If by chance you do not plug the cord perfectly straight into you lighter socket there is a chance the end of the plug will snap off. The metal contacts on the end of the plug will then be flung into your lighter socket-shorting the circuit and violently frying/burning the car's fuse for your lighter/power socket. I would strongly recommend carrying extra of the appropriate size/rating fuses for your car's lighter/power socket and for the plug's internal fuse. If either one goes then you've got a useless GPS-not good when you're in an unfamiliar area."
3,Replacement,"This was a replacement for my StreetPilot 2820, which was shorted and blowing fuses. The original is about 2 1/2 years old. The replacement arrived timely and it works well, speaker is clearer then original. I knocked off two stars due to the cost, this thing should be about $15."
4,Did not ship as promised!,"I have no problem with the product,BUT I paid for next day shipping. I ordered on Tuesday 8/25, I received email saying it shipped 8/26, but I did not receive product until Monday 8/31/09! UPS told me to contact Amazon...guess what no phone number!"
3,Does not last long,"After a year of using this, it stopped working. It may be time to get a new GPS that does not rely external power source."
5,Replacement Cable made the Garmin perform like new.,"This Garmin is over 7 years old, but I like it better than the newer models and it now works like a charm again with the new cable."
2,Garmin Autopilot cord purchased at Amazon.com,"I'm concerned about it. I replaced the original because the unit kept quitting due to an apparent loose wire? I thought a new cord would solve the problem. But it did cut out today. Maybe it was just a 'fluke.' We'll see.12/31/11 I have been using the new cable for a few months now. If something jars the adapter in the dashboard socket, the unit cuts out. Sometimes it comes back on by itself, other times not. I think it is just a bad patent! I am not very happy with it, as I never know when it is going to cut out. Garmin should do better than this."
3,Not worth it,"I was trying to avoid buying a new GPS. The only thing really wrong with my several-year-old Garmin was the cigarette-lighter-plug in. The new one worked in 1 car for a few days and never worked in the other car. We can't be sure the problem is not with the cigarette lighters, but this seems too coincidental."
4,nail clippers,"None of the fancy clippers I got from Amazon this time - including ones made by Trim, had nail files like those on the old Trim models..This is a HUGE deficiency which destroys the efficacy of what are otherwise acceptable products."
2,ez grip clipper,I found the clippers easy to grip but nail cutting difficult. Where I was able to connect to a nail and cut it the cut was not a clean cut.
4,Surrealism and the Sacred,"This book attempts to create a new perspective, both deep and wide, of the surrealist movement and the manifestations of the sacred in modern art of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By employing the phenomenology of the sacred and the parallel histories of art and religion, Rabinovitch charts the territory between art and religion beyond the historical context of surrealism.Time then is a place of enchantment where past and present advance or recede as the image strikes our eyes. Then art expresses both history and the experiential time of the artist, which opens to moments that give form to radiant and vital reflections of ourselves."
4,"Great series, fair entry.","I am a big fan of this series and a collector of movie trailers. I have all the volumes and some from other companies. This volume is pretty good, but my least favorite of all. 1 being my fav with 3 and 5 a close second and third.This volume seems to focus more on action(non-kung fu) and just random movies. Not a great deal of horror or sleaze, which I watch for. Still worth owning, but I would get this one last."
2,Only Hollywood could screw up this story!,"I will say this up front: The casting in this film was spot-on. Audrey Hepburn fit her role beautifully and, while I've NEVER been a fan of Henry Fonda, I was pleasantly surprised as to how he shone as ""Pierre"". As for everything else, this version of War and Peace drifted far from Tolstoy's masterpiece -- this thing was just a bunch of Hollywood fluff. I held out some hope for the battle scenes but, again, disappointment.If you want to see a brilliantly-done War And Peace DVD, watch the Russian one (subtitled) and forget this cumbersome Hollywood Juggernault of a film. Here it is:War and Peace (Special Edition)"
3,"I love Audrey, but not necessarily this movie...","I adore Audrey Hepburn in all of her movies, but even she couldn't make WAR AND PEACE entertaining enough to keep my interest through one much less two tapes. Now, this is not an opinion based on lack of attention span since GONE WITH THE WIND is one of my favorite movies. Tolstoy's story is simply dry and confusing no matter the format."
2,Tolstoy rolls over in his grave,One has to wonder if the screenplay writers of this movie ever read the book? They turn this multi character epic into a Hollywood love story and completely miss the varied perspective that makes this story a great one. Watch the Sergei Bondarchuk version if you want to see this as it should be. The BBC version is closer to the book but I feel the Sergei Bondarchuk version makes a better movie while still staying true to the gist of the original story.Shame on Hollywood for ruining this classic.
2,What a waste and disappointment.,"The production values here are very high, and this is exactly the kind of film I usually like, but this is so horribly cast it is just ruined.Henry Fonda sounding like Abe Lincoln as a Russian with a french name. Audrey Hepburn trying desperately to bring life into the story, and consequently not one her best performances. Mel Ferrar comes off best of the bunch. He is well cast in historical drama and the charcter he plays is suited to his personal style. Anita Ekberg is also extremely well cast, but seems to be poorly dubbed. Her non verbals are excellent. The story is sweeping, the costumes beautiful.Too bad so much time, money and energy was spent on such a ""calvacade of stars"" cast. The best scenes were thanks to the cinematographer & lighting. UGH. What a tremendous disappointment.This is the kind of film I would usually watch over and over. I have watched this twice and could barely stand it the second time. AARGH."
4,Tolstoy's classic Hollywood style.,"Despite the many draw backs that follow the release of a hollywood movie based on a classic novel, this film is quite exceptional. The cast and their acting alone is something to marvel at, notwithstanding the fantastic wardrob nor the vast amount of effort put into the movie's sole battlescene. The one great fault within this movie is the director's reluctance to remain true to the book. Many important sections of the book that made the novel so great were left out, or slightly manipulated. However, movie lovers and book lovers alike are sure to enjoy this film immensely."
2,Plllt.,"If you read the book, you will not like the movie. The panoramic battlefield scenes are spectacular, but the movie does not do justice to the novel."
3,It was ...,"Long. Henry Fonda, yes. In this role, no. A very young Audrey Hepburn.. What you would expect based on what you have heard about War and Peace."
4,An interesting mystery based on the Moche culture of Peru,The book's appeal rests in the historical background of the Moche culture of pre-Columbian Peru. Antiques dealer Lara McClintock finds out about the Moche when gold artifacts come into her possession and murders follow.She traces the objects back to Peru and uncovers the source of the illegal antiquities trade.Good writing and historical detail make this mystery a good read.
2,A bit of a yawn,"Not a particularly interesting or captivating read. The characters were not engaging and mostly unbelievable. The pace was slow and at times rather difficult to grasp and mostly unrealistic. I'd recommend Clive Cussler, Dan Brown for a far far better read."
1,Implausible.,"First, Lara is a bit too precious. She doesn't have boyfriends, she has 'partners.' Second, I find it hard to believe that after her shop is the scene of arson and murder, that she runs away to Peru, stopping in Mexico to assume a false identity. (And where in Mexico does one find a congressman named Lucas May?) Never mind that one of her best friends is Canandian Mountie and she refuses to listen to his advice, never mind that she leaves her business partner in the lurch, never mind that she questions everyone's ethics but her own when she is using forged documents. Third, the plot is contrived and complicated, but everything get neatly wrapped up in the final pages. Fourth, Hamilton fills pages with 'archaelogy lessons.' And just to be picky, how does a Canadian pass herself off as a Kansas woman to other Americans? Lara's linguistic talents must be as impressive as her smugness."
3,Moche Warrior,"I read Lyn Hamilton because I like mysteries with an archaeolical background. Her three books so far have made that part interesting, however she lacks the 'good story' ability. I loose interest in her characters. This story was too hard to believe. Anyone who would just fly off to New York, then Mexico and then Peru after the loosing the profit capability of her business (believe me I know the cost of one-way airfares) has to have an income that makes the reasons was going off on this jaunt seem ridiculous. All the characters were set up well enough, but very little they did seemed real. Example: the wife of the customes inspector from Peru with three births to her body being able to attract a very successful French smuggler and be able to wear the 'teen' styles of barely a silk slip. Her endings are neat, but that's fine with me. It suits the genre."
3,phat,when he frist came out rapping his flow was alot tighterhis beats could be better coming from rap-a-lot.
5,these are excellent products.,Yummy and very spicy. So good with cheese and crackers. This salami special and disappears quickly when served to guests.
4,WHAT!,"To the dude below me. WTF OVER RATED? 1/2 the kids I know have never heard of Bleeding Through or Killswitch Engage, So were the **** do you get off saying this band is over rated. Now that thats said this is a really good album if you like hard bands that KICK ASS. The music is clutch and the singer is freakin crazy. Now the live shows are really good as well but if your into good metal/or Hardcore this and their other album are a must to ANYONE."
1,Not a Metal Band,"For a while I have been hearing about Bleeding Through and when I heard them I couldnt believe that people I knew actually listened to this. The bottom line is they are not a metal band. THey are an emo band that want to make there listeners feel that they are more hardcore than the ones listen to bands like Good Charlotte. If you are into the weaker genre of music like Atreyu or From Autumn to Ashes you will most likely enjoy this but if you like true metal like Hypocrisy, Shadows Fall, or even Cradle of Filth you are going to hate this band."
2,Fordham edsel,"Julia Fordham has the ache the take the make of a chanteus, a loose excuse for wonderous windy poetry. Just like That!She has a throaty vocal with high eyebrows that recalls Joni Mitchell.She sings for adults, maybe in a penthouse, maybe after a night out with a man that she doesn't like all that much. And, damn, you better be a high-pocketed man to get her to like you. She won't. Well, maybe she will. Champagne and Chet Baker might get her to sing with her evocative wink.""Magic"" tells all...A fine wrap-around CD for girlsand boys that like them curled up and wishin'"
5,Quite tasty,"I don't understand the other reviewers that complain about having to wash the product. Quinoa needs to be washed before cooking. It's a simple task. If that is too much to handle, I'm surprised that they can manage measuring the right amount of water and waiting the requisite amount of time to boil it.Having gotten that out, this product is delicious. I highly recommend. I just cooked it today in some left over baked chicken juices with baby carrots and green beans. I love that you can just toss random things when you cook the quinoa and it changes the character of the dish. Other nights I add dried fruits and nuts.And the size is great. One package is probably right for 10 adults if it's a side to a main course."
4,Healthy and good,"If you're trying to add quinoa to your diet, this is a good product that is quick and easy to cook, tastes good, and is healthy for you. When Amazon has it at a good price, it's priced much better than other stores for the amount you get. I've shopped around and so far Amazon's price is the best, especially if you use subscribe and save."
5,Great for my dogs' coats!,"Both my dogs, a beagle and a schnauzer, are silky soft and smell wonderful! A little bit goes a very long way. I wll definitely buy this product again, along with the shampoo which is also awesome!"
2,no relief,Product did not work in relieving my dogs itchy skin. No effect in any way. No help with hot spots areas.
3,Just ok,"The smell of this product is pleasant. Definitely not overbearing. This probably is a better product for smaller dogs and/or lighter coats. Though gentle enough to use everyday, you do need to be careful not to overapply, else in a few days your pet will get a greasy film and need a bath. Additionally, pets respond to various medications just as people can, so make sure to talk with your vet about the type of skin issue your pet has. Your pet may not respond to the ingredients in this product. After several months of using both the shampoo and conditioner, I still didn't get the needed results and moved on to something else."
4,this was described correctly,"So, if you are going to try to raise crickets for your new frog or lizard be sure to do your research. Crickets in the bait shop are not self replicating. Adults will eat their babies and that equals no new adults. This kit is for after your adult females have laid their eggs in a container of soil (supplied in this kit). The soil is removed to a separate container (supplied) than the adults so they they don't get ate. This kit is to START raising those pinhead crickets to a feed-able size. The 40 oz container will hold 40 oz of your favorite beverage. Not so big but will get the pinheads hatched. You will want to get a couple of larger containers because they must be kept clean and over population is bad for the crickets. I maybe would have gone 5 stars but the 40 oz container is way cheap. This may even be a good science project type thing for a youngster."
3,Waiting for the babies,"I am still waiting for the babies, but this product should do well. The biggest problem I have is keeping it warm enough."
3,There are better options...,"Just like the other reviewer said, this kit is way too small for anyone who really wants to breed crickets. It may be okay if you just have a baby lizard that only eats pinheads, but even then you are going to need something more substantial for grown crickets to repeat the reproduction cycle. The containers are kinda flimsy. Instead of buying this, readCricket Breeding Made Easy: Your Guide to Raising Healthy Feeder Crickets."
4,Elegant but Simple,Great ideas for desserts that are made from things already on your shelf and that don't take too much time to make.
2,Gail Gand's Short and Sweet,Didn't love this book...attempted a few times to use but found not to like the combinations of ingredients. On the shelf in my diningroom.
5,PSO fans of the music will love this!,"I am a HUGE video game music connoisseur and I own many soundtracks of video games. My reason for owning so many? Video game music is an art. It is the art of creating the mood for the games you play. Wether it be something as demonic and ambient as Silent Hill music, or as melodic and symphonic as Phantasy Star On-line music, it gives mood to the games you play.This CD is a remix of all the songs that I have come to love and enjoy on this CD. I listen to it while driving down the road. My favorite song is probably the 3rd to last song on the CD, which is probably the best boss fight song I've ever heard. You must get this amazing CD!"
2,Khaled's famous Taxi Chase scene is not included here!?,"For all of those who suffered the hardships of looking for that song, I finally discovered that it's called ""Alech Taadi"", Arabic meaning: ""Why run away?"", which fits the taxi chase scene perfectly. This song belongs to a world-famous Rai artist known as Khaled. It's part of his ""N'ssi N'ssi"" album (Arabic meaning: Forget! Forget!). I thought that this song (like most of you) would be included in this Serra's album. Khaled's famous 5th Element Taxi Chase Scene is available at Amazaon.com. I rate Khaled's N'ssi N'ssi album at 5, but this Serra's collection at 2.5 for failing to include Khaled's track, Alech Taadi.Best regards,[...]"
4,very cool,"I just bought this CD four days ago, and it hasn't left my player yet. The mix of song styles is really eclectic, but it all flows together well. All of the songs are good, but my favorites are ""Akta"", ""Five Millenia Later"", ""Leeloo"", ""Mina Hinoo"", ""Lucia di Lammermoor"", and ""Diva Dance"". Also, ""Ruby Rap"" and ""Aknot! Wot?"" are hilarious. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5, though, because many of the songs are way too short, and the song during that plays during the car chase is not included. But it's still a great soundtrack!"
5,Great!,The Fifth Element soundtrack is one of the most creative interesting and overall fun to listen to soundtracks of all time. If you liked the movie you'll like the music
5,Not For the SimpleMinded,"The Fifth Element is a CD for those of us who like to be enlightened. For those stuck in this sark sreary pointless world, you had better run over and find a cd with Faith Hill and PJ Harvey on it. If you need much to help you escape and help you feel all the surrealism that surrounds the plight of Leeloo and Korban. The music is magical and perfectly set to the pecatcular film. The aria performed by the Diva is second to none. -SQ"
3,Taxi Chase Scene,"For all of those who suffered the hardships of looking for that song, I finally discovered that it's called ""Alaach Taadi"", meaning ""Why are you running"", by a world famous Rai artist known as Khaled, in his ""N'ssi N'ssi"" (meaning Forget! Forget!)album. I thought that this song (like most of you) would be included in this Serra's album. Khaled's famous taxi chase scene is available at Amazaon.com.Best regards,"
2,meandering tekno music,I enjoyed this movie so much that I ran out and bought this CD without previewing it first. The CD is filled with slow pointless background music. The great music from the chase scene is missing entirely! The only good tracks are the rap on track 10 (or was it 8?) and the Diva's song on 14 and 15. Tracks 14 and 15 are so good actually that they almost justify buying the CD. Better yet just buy the awesome movie and watch that part over and over.
4,Great music,"This a great CD. The only problem I have with it is that the song from the chase scene is missing. Other than that, it's great. The music is very eerie but beautiful. Some of the songs are just boring background music, but there are plenty of good ones. I recomend tracks 1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, and 26. 14 and 15 are the best. If you liked the movie, chances are you'll like the soundtrack too."
2,Two good songs... That's it.,"The movie was EXCELLENT, the CD's not. I own both the movie and now the soundtrack and am overall disappointed with the CD. It's not even a complete soundtrack, the chase scene song is missing. If you're willing to spend the money for just the diva song then the CD is worth it (that's all I bought it for). The rest of the CD is fair."
4,Weel worth the purchase,"If you happined to see the movie, you know the effects were great and that the music score is wonderful. The movie got horrible reviews. However it really was a well made movie. Effects that made you wonder, how did they do that? A story line that fit altogether. Again, a music score that is well worth the purchese."
4,AWESOME SOUNDS,I loved the movie (its amongst my favorites!) and i couldnt wait to find the CD. And i was SO hoping it wasnt going to be all the back ground music. I was delighted when it had the DIVA dance music in it. That was my main reason for getting the CD. Overall its a very good soundtrack CD with all the best parts in the movie on the CD.
4,"4.5 stars: Eclectic, even better than the movie","This time around, a basic movie by Luc Besson (his worst to date, in my opinion) was framed by yet another outstanding work of music by Besson's longtime musical scorer, Eric Serra. Although this is not his best work (""The Big Blue"" hands down has that title) it is a great sountrack. It combines Middle-Eastern influences with operatic voices, in a blend that has the unmistakeable Eric Serra seal. It presents an evolution from his earlier electronic work into what is to be found later on in his scoring for ""The Messenger"" (though that work lacks the cohesiveness that ""Fifth Element"" presents). All in all, a very good album, which deserves a special place in the collection of anyone who is serious about movie music or eclectic music altogether."
2,One piece alone worth the money!,"Although I HATED MOST of the music on this cd (way too ""techno-fusion"" type for my conservative taste), I bought this cd ONLY for the 3-minute Donizetti aria sung by Inva Mula-Tchako and IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY JUST FOR THIS! I was so mesmerized by her performance of this piece that I spent two weeks trying to find out the actual title of the piece (Il Dolce Suono)and try and find other recordings by her (couldn't)."
2,Choppy,"I loved the movie and thought (and still do think) it had a wonderful score, but, isolated, the music is a little choppy. The songs are short and fade in and out, appropriat for the film but without the images they lack coherence. A few of the tracks are still wonderful, like the Diva techno-aria, but the rest is pretty much background music. Don't listen to it all the way through; do buy it, rip and mix it in with your other music for nice hip interludes."
4,Wonderful gift,"My parents put this desktop calendar in my stocking for Christmas in 2003. I have enjoyed each page. Some pages are traditional, some have international influences, and others are traditional. I often leave a page showing until several days after it has passed. The card stock type calendar provides a great opportunity to save those pictures that are really lovely. I am disappointed that it doesn't appear that this calendar will be published in a 2005 version."
1,...,"Great service from the seller, but the product is not that good. The volume went out within 30 days. People would call and you could not hear what they were saying, and they could not hear me. Still having a hard time with Samsung to get the warrenty fulfilled. Your money is better spent on another product."
2,WEP170,This product would not work with my blue-tooth cellphone. However the manner in which it arrived was acceptable and timely.
2,One Good Skill Does Not a Book Make,"I concur with another reviewer...it was waaaaaaaaaaay too long and annoyingly repetitious. And, no, not anyone can be an expert skier, so I hate the title. Anyone who is willing to ski 50 days a year can be, but this provides no instant fix. I read the book a few years ago when I was just learning. I wasn't able to actually understand and apply what was in the book until I was advanced skier (and I do ski 55+ days a year). The Phantom Move really did allow me to up my game while maintaining control. Not for beginners, in my humble opinion.So while the technique has genuine merit, the title is misleading and the book an awful read."
5,We Need More from the Kinkster,"Every now and then you need a diversion and this book gives it to you. It is hilarious, off the wall and right on the money all at the same time. Nothing for the serious reader but something we all should read in our world today. Kinky for Governor for sure ... look out Texas!"
1,This book is retarded,"A friend who had the same taste in reading as me recommended this book so I bought it. I was in a few spots funny, but more dumb then anything. Save your money."
2,They Didn't Do what they PROMISED,"I recieved my light via UPS and the difusser has a crack in it. I called the company, explaining the problem. They told me ""it happens alot, we'll send a new one out to you right away"". The guys name was Gary/Gerry... whatever. His name could have been Bozo and I would have respected the company more if they had done what they promised. Now I have a light with the SAME problem that I was replacing my OLD light with!!!"
2,"doo, doo...","Don't waste your money. If you are a black male with PFB (razor bumps) go with the Panasonic brand all the way. They are expensive, but worth the price. (Panasonic Er 160 check it out)"
1,Disappointed,"I cannot even comment on how this software rates educationally because the main homepage of the program was unacceptable to me. It was the scene of a toy room, which prominently featured a doll (with breasts) in a pink bikini. This obviously isn't the image I'd like to burn into my sons' minds everyday when they open this program. Even if I had a daughter, it's not something I'd want her to have to look at each day. I realize it's just supposed to be one of the toys, but it's right up front and is one of the first things you see.We definitely won't be using this program."
1,not what I expected,"Even though the disc were really cheap, I expected it to be more engaging like any online kids learning site. It was hard to navigate around the cd for specific lessons."
1,NOT the entire album,"I purchased this because it was purported to be the entire Murphy's Law ""Back with a Bong"" album - a great old album - but instead only got the ""A Day in the Life"" track. Not a bad track, but the title and prior reviews are completely misleading, as you will NOT receive the entire Murphy's Law album, let alone 2 like the one review stated. You will ONLY get the Day in the Life track."
4,marry me voices..,"i had become attached to the original TV series voices, and when i purchased this tape...i was really dissappointed! (also, the ghost cat i found INCREDIBALLY annoying...). nevertheless, i was still humored by Ryoga's ""cat habits."" in the second episode, both akane and ranma's fathers become enemies over a game/food ""dissagreement""....it was humerous, but not the best i've seen. (i loved how Soun chockes on the potato, though...^-^). Definately not the best Ranma, but you'll get a couple laughs."
4,Excellent Formulary,"The KState crew does it again... pocket pet drugs galore from the pocket pet Gods. This nice little book took a while to come out, but it was worth waiting for. The book is extremely comprehensive and well referenced, easy to use and gives you multiple options on the different treatment regimes. However, there are some misprints on drug dosages which the acute veterinarian will pick up, so be careful... All in all, you must buy this book!!"
4,exotic animal formulary 3rd edition,"I enjoyed the depth of information, made available, it covers a numer of animal species, as a new Veterinary Technologist student, I believe this will be an asset, to my studies."
2,Should have known,"The singer clearly misses her former bandmates here. Not surprisingly, the lyrics and vocals are quite good. But the CD hardly kept my attention, and the lyrics and emotions merely sounded INDULGENT without Concrete Blonde's overall sound. My money would have been better spent elsewhere."
5,I wouldn't have expected anything less . . . .,"I'll be brief - when people set around and ask where music is heading, and what will ever happen to rock, and who will carry the torch for the next wave I point to 3 artists: Johnette Napolitano, Regina Spektor and Joan (As Policewoman) Wasser. Odd that they are all women - but I guess that's just the way the cookie (or the rock stars) crumbled!Scarred is nothing less than a beautiful soul baring piece of work. It was better than I can describe in words except to say - it was necessary. One of those artistic pieces/moments that you know, even if you had never heard it, that the world would be different without its having been brought to life.Buy it, you'll like it. I'll even venture to say there will be moments when you will need it."
5,Wow.,"What an array of wonderfully crafted songs. Johnette's songwriting is among the best in rock history--they are all different and interesting, and often overwhelmingly powerful. Easily the best rock singer still alive and performing--and better than ever. So underrated . . . If being a great musician is about expressing human emotions with all their breadth and profundity, and I think it is, the best I have ever seen live are Johnette Napolitano and Jerry Garcia. Will Crewdson clearly had a fine influence on one of the truly interesting musical artists of our time. There's something about the REAL musicians--most of them for me are older than me--but they just GLOW or something . . ."
2,Scarred?,This CD does no justice for the career of Johnette Napolitano. The album lacks her real song writing ability and lead vocals that we have come to love by her previous albums with Concrete Blonde.
2,For Brooding Lesbians Only,"First of all I love everything by Concrete Blonde. My problem with this disc is that is doesn't rock hard enough. The lyrics are a bit out front in the mix and the subject matter seems to mostly revolve around a new girlfriend and how fantastic she is, it's not a CD for the guys. Do not associate this CD with anything by Concrete Blonde. Let it be known that Concrete Blonde has always fit in with my Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Sex Pistols and Rolling Stones mix tapes. If you are a brooding intospective female this might be a good fit. It's no wonder Concrete Blonde broke up."
5,fabalous,"This is a masterful album. Glen is a master, a great album for christian and non-christian alike. Simply great music"
4,Truth in Music,"I'm glad I rediscovered this amazingly weird and delightful record by the artist formerly known as Rotten. The techno-influenced rock suits his bizarre voice as well as his torn and safety-pinned clothes did when he was younger and nastier. His lyrics always were about a contemporary world of conflict, tension, and potential desolation. Maybe, that's how techno works with his message: pointing out the personal ruin in the economic boom of the 90s as much as in the recession of the 70s. We're living in the ""no-future"" The Sex Pistols warned us about: Many relationships are virtual and relative instead of intimate and familiar. There's not many real products left to be distanced from. And many of us, even the most seemingly normal, feel like aliens lost beyond alienation. This is how the music sounds - strange and otherworldly, just the truth."
1,Terribly Produced,"I enjoyed later PiL CD's not only because of their catchy/strange tunes, but because of the quality of the production. The sound on this one is so poor it's impossible to enjoy. . . it sounds like it was made in his garage."
5,"It's the same thing from the original, maybe better","There's nothing like a fresh set of blades on your bean. It comes with a new blade and that cover part that comes off, so its like using a brand new shaving machine. Just thinking about it makes me wanna shave my head right now."
1,Wahl & dealers would not answer any questions,I bought a great Wahl 99 dollar set with 3 screens at walmart that lasted 8 years of daily use doing a great job Model 4400. I would like a new cutter and screen set like shown in the 5 star and a screen shown for a 4000 but no responses. I also have Norelco and Remington but Wahl is the best so why discontinue parts and service on an outstanding razor so why buy anything else from them???
5,Works Like New,"So glad I bought the replacements, my old ones were so worn out. I think I have bought the replacements 3x now since I got my WAHL shaver. It works like new again, nice and sharp."
4,great shave and great shipping,I'VE BEEN USING THIS SHAVER FOR ABOUT 3 YRS AND I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS BASED ON MY REPLACEMENT OF THE FOIL HEAD AND BLADE ONCE A YEAR.
4,regular replacement purchase,"this was a normal replacement part.. still working great... would be nice if the colors matched... ordered a red one, got a grape colored/maroon replacement"
5,A great worship experience,"This is without a doubt one of my favorite worship albums. My favorites are 'Set Me On Fire', 'Father', and 'Your Love Reaches Me'. It is certainly not the most polished live recording around, but if you value that sort of thing, you probably wouldn't be interested in this album anyway. I recommend it. Buy it. Listen. Worship God."
1,Worst Ever,"I'm sorry, this is the worst video ever. The most helpful thing about this video is the insert with the ukulele chords. The video is completely outdated, too much talking not enough teaching. Don't buy it."
1,Useless - dont waste your money,"A lot of chatting, three chords and that's it. I couldn't believe it when I realized I'd come to the end of the DVD!You can learn more on YouTube in a few minutes.No redeeming value. Can't imagine what they were thinking..."
1,OSX and irez kriiters,"i have a kritter USB 1.0 which worked fine with my Mac OS 9.2i recently upgraded to OSX and found that the reeleyes driver program that came with the camera is not made for OSX. i contacted irez and they said they have no plans to make it for OSX. so i had to buy a driver (for $$$) from a nice and friendly company called ioxperts.com. now things are fine, but i wish irez was on the ball enough to keep up with OSX. and finding any specs on their site is pretty much hopeless."
1,the most horrible lil device,I am a computer geek myself but couldn't get this working. the camera gives a USB bus error when connected in Win2K. more investigation reveals it wants more USB bandwidth than is available. i have a host of other products(cameras too) running on my USB but this is the only one that gave this problem.
4,Learned more about Shaken Baby,"I'm glad I found this book, it gives me hope for the little girl I want to adoption who suffers from Shaken Baby Syndrome."
3,A PURE REGGAE ALBUM,"Fans of UB40 who brought this 1997 album expecting to hear lightweight pop grooves reminisent of their previous ""Promises and lies"" CD may have been surprised. ""Guns in the ghetto"" is a very pure reggae album that wastes no time trying to attract a pop audience. For this reason,it will probably not go on to be UB40s best remembered album, but tracks like ""Always there"", ""I love it when you smile"" and the title song make it worth buying,as do ""Tell me is it true"" ""Oracabessa moonshine"" and ""lisa."""
5,Old school sound,"This is why I started listening to hip hop in the first place. Uplifting party music. Crack a brew, grab your favorite girly, losten the elastic on those Addidas sweat pants, and start dancing like its 89."
1,Don't bother if you are looking for hip hop.,"I heard ""Meat Shake"" (not on this album) on the radio and liked it enough to give them a try. Nothing on this one comes close to the catchy cleverness of Meat Shake. They sound like the Beastie Boys before they found their chops. Their sense of humor is fine but the music is dated and boring."
1,a load of crap,dont buy it its not worth it dont even bother downloading it 3/4 of it is about rambling on about meatshakes which makes you want to puke more than entertaining you
1,a total disappointment,"I really do not recommend it to anyone. I have a strong dancing background. I've danced as a hobby, classical and modern ballet, jazz dance, tap dance, ballroom dances for over 15 years. It was hard even for me to follow. Oh I do not mean the first parts where the instructor gives you some basic jazz dance moves. They are easy to follow and do (that is if you have the room to do them). However, in the end, it becomes total chaos, so hard to follow. Maybe if I've been patient enough to rewind a lot of times, I would have learned it but then what's the use of so much rewinding if you are doing it to have fun and stay fit. The too much rewinding takes away my motivation. So now the tape sits at the back of my bookcase, gathering dust. I am so disappointed. A total waste of money."
3,Decent.,The light is bright enough. The carabiner is sturdy enough and cool enough. But the on-off switch is very stiff and difficult to operate.
5,Nothing Short Of Excllent!!!!!,Janet Has Done it again!!!!! This was beautifully done. Ienjoy all the songs I bought this album on December 24 1997 and I can't put it down. Way to go Janet!!!
3,"Not her worst by a long shot, but you can see her starting to slip here","Though the Velvet Rope did spawn a couple of bona fide Janet essentials with ""I Get Lonely"" and ""Together Again,"" it also shows that the flawless faade that she'd kept up for the last decade was starting to crack a bit. The aforementioned songs and a couple of others are decent, but overall, this was largely a messy and unfocused album for Janet, and only the most hardcore Janet completists should find any album she made after this one necessary listening. All For You and Discipline are awful, Damita Jo isn't much better, and 20YO, though fairly respectable, is still really nothing special."
1,depression,"don't buy this album unless you want depression, its too sad and the song quality isnt as good as other janet albums."
2,Janet Jackson's music is nothing special,"I feel guilty for writing this review because this really isn't the type of music I listen to. I'm a little off kilter and so instead of making Janet look more respectable I found ""The Velvet Rope"" to be betraying to her. I didn't take this effort of hers very seriously, and except for a couple songs, I didn't take the music seriously either. I wonder where Janet would be if not for Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. I'm sure she has had some input of course but not enough to make her a viable artist. Janet is exclusively an Entertainer, just like her brother, and if not for her intoxicating charisma she wouldn't be making albums."
1,Someone should take this velvet rope and wrap it around--,"Oops! i was getting carried away there, but really, this CD stinks worse than a dirty toilet! Sure it spurred som hits, but Janet, can you make an album without Jimmy Jam and Terry? Hmmm..."
5,a beautiful masterpiece of an album,"Janet expanded on her r&b roots with this beautiful album and created a timeless masterpiece that still sounds fresh today. If you want to hear the real janet jackson, this is the album. She's sexy(without overdoing it), she's creative and she's in control of her music and timeless sound on this album. And she's also very real, you can't get any realer than she did on Velvet Rope, and sadly she couldn't live up to it after this CD."
5,amazing janet period,"The Velvet Rope era and album was amazing, and also underrated. The awards kept coming and so did the hits, and the tour was INCREDIBLE. I love the music on this album, it's a mix of r&b, pop and dance, but very mellow compared to the albums that came out before this one, which is why Velvet Rope is her most daring, most creative, most innovative and most ambitous album. I also agree with the many reviewers that she was never able to top this effort, despite the brand new janet single All Nite which I'm sure will become a hit. Buy this today."
5,Great cd! I love every song!,"I have to say that this is the album that made me a Janet Jackson fan. I had liked some of her other songs (like ""Nasty,"" ""If"" and ""Runaway""), but this is the album for me that found a special place in my heart. The song ""Velvet Rope"" is beautiful and made me understand myself a little better; Janet and I are kindred spirits. I also love the songs ""Go Deep,"" ""I Get Lonely,"" and ""Free Xone."" If you only buy one Janet album, make it this one! A+"
1,She Can't Sing or Act but she can Dance pretty Good!,"I can't never understand a word that comes out of her mouth! She always mumble her words. She can dance pretty good but her voice I can't stand, not even with all the technology behind it. She still cannot sing."
3,A Little Too Dark,"I am a huge Janet fan, and I am sorry to say that this CD did not move me as much as her previous ones. Some tracks have a very nice beat and a couple have some wonderful lyrics, such as the hit ""Together Again"", but Janet seems to have taken a turn for the worse on this album, going into deeper, darker waters that are just too dark for me. This CD would be so much better if she had included more of a variety of music, including more upbeat songs and lyrics. If you listen to this CD too much, you're going to become depressed. So if you buy this CD, I must warn you that the depression in her voice and music will certainly get you down."
2,very run of the mill,"aside from we go deep, i get lonely and the title cut this album is weak.her voice is still weak and has no hope what so ever.she is vastly overrated.and she is compared to michael? who in there right mind would even dare.she is still trying to be madonna jr."
2,Not Janet's Best,"Janet Jackson is a very talented singer, dancer and actor but this album did not live up to her other work. I much prefer All For You over this album. Don't get me wrong there are still good tracks on here like ""Together Again"" and ""Every Time"" but there are just to many fillers on here to make this album likable for me. I still respect her as an artist and I support what she does but I ain't feeling her this time."
3,Janet is pretty cool........,i have to admit that i dont REALLY like her but this c.d. is one of her best. the singles were great and i think she shuld make some more of this c.d. so it can go platinum.
4,You Go Girl!,"This cd is just all that! There's a few songs on there that drove me crazy and the interludes are kinda stupid but this cd is worth spending the money on! ""Got 'Till its Gone"" is probably my favorite, because of the Joni Mitchell backup. ""Everytime"" is absolutely breathtaking! I also loved ""Together Again"" and she kicks with ""What About""! I reccommend buying this cd!"
5,"Her BEST album, yet!","I love the album! It's probably one of Janet's best! By listenin' to the album, you can tell that Janet knows what she's doin'. She's expressing herself the way she never has before on the past albums. She is free and more open about herself on TVR. And I think she got a majority of positive response from the public by expressing herself like so. And that's really cool on Janet's part! It's like every album gets cooler and by doin' that she will and has gained more respect from her public. The songs are absolutely AWESOME! I can't say which ones are my favorite cause I love them all! Janet ROCKS! And she can only get better! =)"
2,Disappointing,"When I just barely bought the cd, I thought that it had a lot of great songs on it, but it was very disappointing because the only song I really liked was ""Together Again"",and the interludes drove me nuts!Janet Jackson is a good singer but some of her cd's are very disappointing."
5,Janet has the most encradable ablum ever!,This is her best ablum. What is even better is that in the furture I think they will get much better. I love Janet Jackson.
3,DIFFERENT BUT RELAXING,THIS CD WAS DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING JANET HAS DONE. IT WAS A MORE JAZZY BUT UP BITPOP AND A FEW SLOWIES MIXED INTO. IT WAS DIFFERENT BUT WORTH LISTENING TO.
3,Janet gets so lonely.,"The Velvet Rope by Janet Jackson is a mixed bag for me. The songs I do like include: Go Deep, I Get Lonely, Everytime, a cover of Rod Stewart's Tonight's the Night, Anything, and What About? The rest of the songs are pretty much filler, Janet's voice is so soft, you can't distinguish what she is singing about, thank god the lyrics are included. The Velvet Rope is probably her most personal album and I appreciate that but this isn't an album I listen too much."
5,this is by far janet jackson's best album to date.,"As Janet Jackson has got older, her music has improved; no more bubble gum music like she recorded when she first came out. Also Janet has progessed so much that she is considered a superstar within her own right and is no longer considered just Michael Jackson's sister. Janet signs songs of social consciousness now and which has improved the quality of her music."
5,Janet is Amazing,"As far as I'm concerned, Janet can do no wrong. I have the CD, and all the others (though a couple are still on vinyl cause I've had them so long). I think Control was a personal albumn for her but this is really deep. She really had to search her soul and experiences for this one. Janet, if you're reading, you inspire me all the time....keep doing what you do. And by the way, the concert at the Garden in NY was off the hook. ""What About"" was intense."
4,Didn't live up to the hype,"I had fallen off the Janet Jackson bandwagon, but the hype around this album, especially the critical raves, compelled me to buy it. While she shows some new range, I was disappointed that by the time I came to the end of the CD, everything was sounding the same."
5,"The best album this year, a true work of art!","Janet Jackson (or just plain Janet) has always been known for pushing the envelope. With her latest release, ""The Velvet Rope"", not only does she push the envelope, but she stamps, seals, and delivers it. ""The Velvet Rope"" is unlike anything you've ever heard before, even for devoted Janet fans. Janet's innocent sexual tease is now replaced with an erotic mistress image. The album is based mostly on the themes of acceptance and sexuality, with the majority focusing on the latter. But despite it's sexual overtones, the message ends up being about love or loneliness. Listening to this album is more than just an experience, it's a journey through the darker side of society and emotions. This album is definitely not recommended for children, unless (for some strange reason) they understand the principles of S&M. END"
2,Disappointing,"When I just barely bought the cd, I thought that it had a lot of great songs on it, but it was very disappointing because the only song I really liked was ""Together Again""."
5,most creative effort to date,"this album is an r&b/hip hop flavoured masterpiece from janet, and I wish she was still making this kind of music today instead of doing bubblegum pop like she did with her last album. Hopefully her new album won't disappoint. But this album is a must for every janet fan"
5,Janet's Very Best,"This album was the best that Janet has ever done. It was extremely personal and very well written. The songs are very different from each other in style and subject but the result is a complex story, intricantly woven from beginning to end. I loved every song but my favorites were ""Everytime,"" ""I Get Lonely,"" and ""What About."" For any that still doubted it, this album is proof that Janet has an extraordinary talent all her own and is not just riding on the coattails of her famous family. I'll admit her voice is not as strong as some artists, even her own brother, but she definitely has a beautiful, if simplistic, singing voice and is a breath of fresh air. She is also very intelligent on this album leaving behind the somewhat juvenile work like ""Control"" and ""Because of Love"" from her former work. This is definitely a must-own for all Janet fans and a good album for non-fans to buy also."
5,"Flawless, A pure Work of Art!","This is a flawless work of art, there really isn't much more to say on this. The beats are innovative the flow of the cd is mezmerizing! This cd illustrates Funk,Hiphop,Triphop,Jazz,House, and new mixures of sound. The cd is a consistent player you can pop this in and let it Go. The intro's are cool and the ghost track is even cool. Janet outdid her self,sad that this may be the best cd she will ever create. Because goodness knows the new one is a fiasco! If I had to say ""what are the stand out tracks that would be hard. But I will say ""We go Deep"" is my favorite I love it because it takes me back to the dayz of Prince and the Time (Jimmy Jam & Terry) were funky! That song is a classic example of that era and the fun that was in it."
2,VELVET ROPE SHOULD PUT A NOOSE AROUND ITS OWN NECK.,"Janet I love you, but your CDs are just getting worse and worse as time goes by. You are sounding very tired and drained with your music. First there was ""Control"", absolute pop masterpiece, then ""Rhythm Nation"" another pop wonder, then ""Janet."" which slipped a little, and now the ""Velvet Rope"" which is a muddled mess. The title cut which is the best song on the CD was never released as a single, instead we get old pop fare as ""Together Again"" a slow version, the radio version is not even featured on the CD, and other boring fare such as ""I Get Lonely"" that just fades into Pop Never Never Land, and ballads so slow you wonder if your still alive and have a pulse, this CD is lacking of one. Janet what has happened to your music? Please tell me. You are becoming as boring and androgenous as your brothers music, and I mean the music...no pun intended. Put some life back into your soul before Virgin drops you like a skydiver with no chute."
3,I Miss The Old Janet,"Janet went from Pop to R&B to Rock to whatever in the last seven years. She has the art of versatility on her side which is a plus in the music business but being someone who grew up with Janet's Control album banging on the stereo, I miss my old Janet. Velvet Rope is a good album and Janet shows her poetic skills as well as her range. Her voice sounds better every time you listen to a new song. I just miss the old Janet ( in looks especially ) and wish she'd get back to the Rhythm Nation-like albums that made her a household name.All and all it's a great Janet album but don't expect that Miss Janet sound most have come to love. She's grown and moved on and though nothing will ever beat her eighties work, Velvet Rope is an album to be respected and loved. Definitly buy it if you haven't already."
5,Destiny's Child in Atlanta,Great product. Everything I expected and more. Recieved it before I had a chance to even think about when it would com.
5,Lovin' the girls,I love this DVD. I watch it while jogging on the treadmill. It helps me push myself for an extra mile or two.
5,GIVE THEM CREDIT,"I THOUGHT THE SHOW WAS GREAT. I SAW IT LIVE IN PHILA. AND IT WAS JUST AS GOOD THEN AS IT IS ON THE DVD. AND AS FAR AS THEM LIPSYNCHING SO WHAT THEY SUNG THEIR LEAD VOCALS ADN THATS ALL THATS IMPORTANT.ANY TRUE DC FAN WONT CARE ABOUT THAT, ANYBODY ELSE IS JUST HATIN. ITS NOT LIKE THEY STAND IN ONE SPOT THEY DANCE ALL AROUND SO ITS ITS UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THEY LIPSYNCH THE CHORUS. THE SHOW WAS PHENOMANAL, THE STAGE, THE DANCING EVERYTHING WAS GOOD INCLUDING THE SINGING. AND AS FAR AS THE WATERFALL SO WHAT IF BRITNEY SPEARS DID IT WHO CARES!! IN ALL OF HER SHOWS SHE LIPSYNCHS SO LETS TALK ABOU THAT! DC DID GREAT SO GIVE THEM CREDIT WHEN ITS DUE!!"
1,SHOCKED,"Attention: I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT THE DVD. AFTER LOOKING AT IT A SECOND TIME, I REALIZED THAT THESE GIRLS CAN ACTUALLY SING. IT WAS A GOOD SHOW BUT I STILL SAY THEY SHOULD HIRE BACKGROUND SINGERS AND MORE MUSICIANS. IT'S NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITES.I PICKED UP THE DVD YESTERDAY AND I MUST SAY THAT I'M NOT VERY PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE. TOO MUCH LIPSYNCING. IT WAS SO OBVIOUS. DID THEY FORGET TO PUT MIKE TO THEIR LIPS? I WAS SHOCKED THAT THERE WERE ONLY 4 MUSICANS PLAYING BACKUP. A LOT OF THE MUSIC WAS TAPED NO DOUBT. THEY ARE VERY PRETTY GIRLS BUT PLEASE! STOP SHORT CHANGING THE FANS. THE EXTRAS WERE BETTER AND VERY INFORMATIVE."
4,Its not bad!,The Last concert for Destinys! Its not bad! I bought this DVD for a Friend! I never seen this video! But He like a lot!
5,BEST FEMALE GROUP EVER!!,"Saw the very first show in St. Louis and it gets no better than this! Hands down, the best concert I've ever went to! Destiny's Child are true performers and they really put on a show! Can't wait to get this DVD (this completes my Destiny's Child collection)!!"
4,Good but not the best,The Dvd wasn't that bad my only problem is Beyonce' solo performance. Ol girl can sing but she was overdoing it and why did she have the longest intro. Michelle that girl really tore it up she had me in amazement. Kelly did good as well. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because Michelle she was really the star that nite.
3,Just OK.,"They are made out of plastic, painted in brass color. Look like they will discolor after a while. If you don't mind that, then is all fine. I bought them for a lamp I was making with a bottle and lamp kit."
2,flimsy,"These are plastic, which didn't really bother me so much, but only one of them would screw onto the lamp harp. The other one will have to be glued."
1,Deceptive description. Super cheap quality,"These are super cheap very light plastic, that want to cross thread and split easily. They don't look like brass- they look like well... gold colored cheap plastic. Tossing in the trash more worth the effort than returning them."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap.",I should have read the reviews on this product before I hit 1-click! These finials are NOT metal but very cheap plastic. Nowhere on the description does it state this. Very disappointing...sending them back!
2,very cheaply made,"I bought these with a new lamp harp I ordered and was very dissapointed in how cheap these feel and appear. I am guessing they are made of plastic and then painted, but I can't be certain. And the color was definately ""off"" from my lamp base. But it wasn't worth the cost of returning them. The shipping was not cheap and I was charged shipping for both the finial and harp which came together in the same packing envelope. The finial does not fit on the lamp with the replacement harp, so it just ""sits"" on top. If I had to do it over, I would definately select different finials or go to an actual store where I can see what I am purchasing."
5,very pleased,"Great product, good construction and sewing on the edges and plenty large enough to cover the entire sled. I would not hesitate to purchase another one if I get another sled."
4,A good value for the price,"This cover is a great value for the price. For $25, you could barely buy a blue tarp and some bungee cords. This cover is by no means a custom fit cover, but does the job well. ORDER ONE SIZE LARGER THEN THE SIZING CHART SAYS YOU NEED. I bought an X-large and it just fits my 115"" sled. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive cover to keep the elements off their snowmachine."
1,Customer Service #1,"I was not happy with the product. They claim this is a XL and did not even come close to fitting my sled. It was short by at least 2-3ft and did not fit over my hood (I have a small windshield too!) Seam was poorly put together and were coming apart in few spots. HOWEVER.. customer service department was VERY GOOD - they went ABOVE AND BEYOND. Not only I got a personal communication from their CS department but was followed by their manager's apology E-mail. If you are thinking about doing business with this company, don't think twice. They will make sure you are satisfied."
1,Cheap product,"Mine broke with the first coin. It's light, flimsy plastic and is definitely not worth twenty dollars. I paid five for mine new and it's not even worth that."
3,So my granddaughter had it on her wish list...,"Requires a teeny, tiny phillips screwdriver (which I don't have) in order to put in 3 AAA batteries (not included). It's a ""cute"" device but seems overpriced. Perhaps it will actually work."
3,Works as expected,"I was looking for a better place to store spare loose change than on top of my dresser. This works fine for holding spare change. It works pretty well, but it often counts dimes as pennies. The good thing about that is that I will have more money in the jar when I empty it than I planned. I will have an extra 9 cents for every mis counted dime."
3,thatslife,"this item worked very well up to a certain point. It counted my change, coin by coin, however, after a while, I had to slip many coins back through the slit because they were not counted the first time. Maybe I've overworked the money jar because I was trying to count up to $600.00 in one day. (I do have a life;because I have a large amount of coins, I was just trying to get this tedious task over and done with. thank you). After a while dimes were not counted at all and pennies were counted as dimes.Apparently, the money jar works well with a smaller amount of coins and even then, I believe it would probably malfunction after a length of time. I noticed in other reviews there were problems with the money jar with less coins. But after a while I was able to count all quarters and nickles. In the future, if I find myself accummulating this amount of change again, I'll probably invest in one of the high end models or just take the coins to a bank."
2,"I don't like it, i'm looking for another one right now!","I got this for Xmas and I was amped about using it. At first it was fine putting a few coins in it a day. Then I wanted to count all the change I've saved over the years, and noticed that it would miss counting some of the coins I inserted, even at a slow pace. Ok, that was an easy problem to deal with... So I had about $110 of coins counted and it was almost full. While adding more coins to it, I looked again after a few minutes, and it read $4.27! I was not happy about that after spending the time and not knowing exactly how much money was in there! So maybe I have a defective one, but I am looking for another one right now, and seeing that for a few dollars more, I can get one that counts & sorts too, I think I'll go with my other options. Good luck to you all!"
4,"Light, Clever Book","My 7-yr old and I read this together. He read most of it aloud and loved it. He asked me to ""ask him questions"" about the book as practice for his schools' ""Reading Counts"" test.Being from the south, he was a little unsure about the snowplow, but he understood the other concepts clearly. This is a cute story, enjoyed very much by a 7 yr-old and his Dad."
3,"Counting processes first, survival analysis second, third,..","The book provides an elegant comprehensive approachto survival analysis and counting processes bymaking use of martingale theory. Product integralsare used as a corner stone of this unified approach.The treatment of the multiplicative intensity modelin Chapter 3 is especially nice.However, lost in all of this unification and elegantmathematical notation is the underlying physical problems,which after all is the whole point. Unfortunately, myfeeling is that scientists who are really interestedin studying event history data (like surival analysis)will find this book unhelpful and probably even unreadable."
4,"Not their best, but still pretty good....","This was a present for my wife, who loves to listen to Altan on our multi-disk changer. As a result I've learned that this isn't their best effort, but is still pretty good. Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh is spellbinding, but the nature of the recording is subtly different from previous works, and doesn't sound quite as bright nor bold. Maybe it's just me, but I'm pretty sure that this, while still amazing, could have been just a little better."
4,"Warrior Walking : A Guide to Walking As Exercise, Meditation","The book was a short and well executed treatment of several martial disciplines, all converged to apply principles of increasing one's level of intrinsic energy, during the daily act of walking. A lot of fun. After I finished I wondered, how could I have missed so much."
1,"BEWARE""restored"" sleazy con.! It's the same old murky blurry dupe-of-a-dupe-of-a-dupe",Yet another crappy dupe of the same-old same-old. Will we ever see a pristine transfer of this film? Where is the original negative--anybody know?
5,Yay!!! Finally!!,"Well, it took years, but they are finally getting ready to release the remaining Melrose DVDs. So happy that they are releasing Volumes 1 and 2 at the same time!"
5,my fav,"good as i remembered, i have the whole set and plan on watching it again. was my favorite night time movie to watch."
5,santa heard me.....,Finally the last season is here after a long long time of waiting :)not the best season....however i enjoyed a lot watching it!!!i hope they have the theme closing time by semisonic at the final scene
2,Ok for fans,"I loved this show. Season 7 is already on Netflix- wow, worse than I remember. Some story lines were ok. Many minor characters became bigger players since the cast had so few characters. Again music has been changed including ""closing time"" in the final sequence of the last episode."
5,Very nice earrings,They are lovely and the size is just what I wanted. I bought two pair as gifts but I'm tempted to keep one for myself.
2,Typical Junk CD Player made today,"This player lasted about 2 months and when it did ""work"" it would stop for no reason and lose power. I found it very frustrating and was almost glad when it stopped all together. I know CD players are not ""in"" right now but this technology is perfect and serves my needs much better than an MP3 player."
3,"Baroque style, violins are shrill","I've only just discovered Spohr via the radio, hearing one of his harp and violin concertos. I looked forward to receiving this album because other composers have produced really lovely duo violin sonatas/concertos and so I expected something delightful. However, the album was surprisingly baroque in style (although Spohr composed in the Baroque era, his violin concertos are more in the classic style, like Beethoven only gentler). Also, both violins were shrill, shrieking out notes that were quite unsettling and unattractive. There was no beauty in this music."
4,give it a try,"After reading the previous reviews I purchased this with some hesitancy. I'm now glad I did so. The clock is great - the windchime sounds are just the thing to rise to in the morning - and i didn't think i would use any of the prepackaged sounds. The clock face does seem to be too bright - even on the lowest setting, but unless you're a person who needs TOTAL darkness to sleep, it hasn't been a problem. I searched for a clock for some time and was not able to find the ideal one - but this was as close as i could get."
3,Daylight Savings time,I loved this clock until daylight savings time changed. Now it drives me nuts as you cant correct or turn off the daylight savings time option and you must manually change it 4 times every year
5,couldn't get this at the dealer,This gasket is different from one side of the motor to the other. Tried to buy OEM but the dealer parts didn't match. Their mechanic said the packages were mis-labeled. They call the distributor and they said it was right. Checked amazon and autozone and both had the proper parts. Hope no one else had this problem.
5,LOVED THIS BOOK!,I wanted this for a long time for my Romonoff Library. It is amazing to look at this book that was a source of entertainment for the Last Russian Royal Familiy in their prison in Siberia.
1,Weigh down workshop,Not impressed at all!!! I am an avid reader but did was not even able to finish this book. I would not personally recommend it.
5,This is the only thing that has worked for me!,I wrote a review a few months ago. I am back again to say that this is the only 'diet' (it's not really a diet) that has worked for me! I've now lost 20 lb. in the first 12-week session of the WD Workshop! You should call the 1-800 number and find a workshop in your area a.s.a.p. and get started on this if you are serious about losing weight. The losing weight is just a side effect of what happens when you start turning to God for everything. My life is so much better now!
5,Praise God and Gwen for this wonderful weight loss workshop,"This is the only thing I've ever found that works! I love that it's a christian-based weight loss program. I have only been on this for a few weeks and already have lots more energy, don't feel nauseated on a regular basis, have less gastrointestinal problems, my low blood sugars are under better control, and I have lost 7 lb and 6 inches. I feel such peace inside me thanks to God! If you would like a Weigh Down buddy, please email me or find me on ICQ # 2633350Andrea age 28, Indy"
1,Where is God's grace?,"I have done some research on Gwen Shamblin, she is a cult leader and it frightens me that she is using her weight loss books to teach others her very limited and legalistic view of God."
3,The diet and beyound,"I am a weight loss guide at the Mining Co. The most interesting aspect of this book for me is the faith healing (and I equal healthy weight management and healing). I have written two articles on the 'Weight Down' topic offering my hypothesis why this diet works (I'm a Ph.D. in physiology).As I am trying to make my weight loss program as interactive as possible, I would be greatly appreciative of any comments."
1,It made me more obsessed with food,"The reason she called it the ""Weigh Down Diet"" is because it has too many rules and because she wanted to sell more books.I don't want to spend the rest of my life worried about whether or not I stopped in time to feel better or not, and whether is was stomach or mouth hunger. There is so much guilt with this program, and instead of helping me, it made me binge. God is my god and savior no matter what I do to unlock all of this garbage from my past: my insecurities, my fear, my past (my brother as a drug user, my parents as alcoholics) My problems need more help than just losing weight....I thought losing weight would cure everything, but I was wrong. This program wasn't for me, but I'm glad it has helped many out there. This book introduced me to Christian music, that is something I will never forget. Good luck to all of you on this program. God rules!"
1,Beware! Research this author!!,"The author has some good tips about eating only when hungry and not feeding your emotions....just your stomach, but this book is much more than about eating. It is all about the Church of Gwen and her bizarre theology. What is tragic about this book is that it is missing something monumental.....GRACE!!I would suggest that you educate yourself extensively about the author. INSTEAD OF THIS BOOK: Check out the grace-oriented weight loss & lifestyle approach of ""Thin Within"" or ""Faithfully Fit""."
3,Not What I Thought It Was. Too Religious For Me.,"This weight loss book infuses too many religious views. Believe me if all I had to do was pray to be skinny, I would have been there years ago. I think weight-loss probably takes more work and better eating, and not just the power of prayer. Unless of course the book is called ""Eat, Love, Pray."""
1,"Beware, not for everyone.","Beware, Ms Shamblin is more interested in converting you to her brand of Christianity than helping you lose weight and develop a healthy lifestyle.She quotes scripture out of context to ""prove"" her opinions.She is a master salesman. The first chapters of the book tell you that you can lose weight without dieting and without self discipline. You can eat anything you want. After you are hooked, she then tells you the facts. Sure you can eat anything you want, just in tiny portions. To control your appetite you must give your life completely over to God. In effect, you have to develop self discipline, you just call it something else.The book has several testimonials which seem to indicate that this plan may work for some people, but it is much too simplistic for a thinking person...."
5,The only way to go!!,"What could make more sense than eating the way God intended usto eat? Our bodies have the perfect indicators, if only we listen andfollow what we hear. Eat when you are hungry, stop when you are satisfied. Eat what your body is calling for. No more counting calories, carbohydrate grams, fat grams, anything. This book makes the most sense of any diet book (I'm sure I've read them all...) and is the simplest to follow."
4,Helped me so much and bought it for others,"This book is filled with scripture. I think some of her doctrinal issues are bit off, but holding to the main principles and the scriptures in this book are what really helped me to lose the weight, not to be a prisoner to the emotional attachment I had to food. She lays it out straight to not be a victim of circumstance and let it be an excuse for overeating, but to forget what is behind and strain toward what is ahead(a very biblical principle Philippians 3:13). I was formerly an addict to alcohol and cigarettes (been clean for 10 years now), but after I had given up those idols to numb me out when I didn't want to deal with life, I went to food. Over the December holidays and beginning of January, I've lost 6 lbs and I don't feel guilty about my eating anymore. What I plan to do is copy out the scriptures from the book to keep me motivated,...so that my focus is on God and not Gwen."
1,Funding and Recruitment Base For Remnant Fellowship,"For the person looking for a spiritually based weight loss guide... it works. Gwen replaces food with God. The message is so strong that almost all WeighDown people know that overweight people are sinners.Weigh Down Workshops are recruitment pools for Gwen's church, Remnant. Using your lost weight as her proof of how she can change your life, she will ask you to leave your church for hers. She is a self-proclaimed prophetess that demands total obedience. I lost my wife to this cult. The prgression is: WDW, WD Advanced (recruitment hook), then Remnant. ALL of the WD Advanced / Remnant people here in my area MOVED TO TENNESSEE!"
2,Misleading information,"Scriptures sited in this book are taken completely out of context particularily those dealing with ""good"" and ""bad"" foods. Encourages people to eat an unhealthy diet based on those scriptures. I would not recommend this program."
2,Be Careful! It will catch up with you!,"I lost 20 pounds fast on this diet. I think I even wrote a review here recommending the book. The problem is once I stopped going to workshops and reading the books (workshops are at least $50 a piece) the weight poured back on. Only now I don't watch what I'm eating.It's dangerous to tell folks they can pour on the salt, not worry about the fat, and ignore exercise. Just don't eat. It's fasting - not dieting! And when you stop, and you're used to the salt and the fat and the lack of exercise, you'll gain more, more quickly, and then have to deal with the guilt that you're being disobedient to God by eating!Let's leave God out of the diet discussion, and bring him into our hearts. I think the author's heart is in the right place, but her suggestions border on compulsion."
4,"Best ""diet"" book ever","This is a great book. It basically boils down to: eat when you are hungry, stop when you are full and God can help you do that!!! There are some things that I did not agree with (de-emphasize of exercise and drinking water) but then maybe for me these are areas that God want me to work on personally. You really can eat anything. I had a steak last night (and haven't had one in years). Boy did it taste good. I didn't eat the whole thing and I was satisfied."
5,The Weigh Down Diet,"This book has changed my life for the better--permanently! The author's views are unique, yet biblically and spiritually sound, carrying the power to revolutionize one's relationship with God. She gives very practical, simple, commonsense advice about how to have victory over the many ways to suffer from the bondage to food through overeating."
4,"I just started the book, so far so good. Do have questions","I do wait til my stomach growls, but I haven't stopped when I'm full yet. . I'm trying to lose 10-15 lbs.for summer feel health and good about myself. Also I'm a little confused about exercise & water. I feel I should drink water and exercise for my health. My Mom passed away 9 months ago and Dad is ill, so I'm concerned about my health and diet, they're Diabetic and Stroke Victims. So they are taught not to eat fat & sugar, watch their diets. I'm 34 & want to take care of myself. Also how long does it take to lose 15 lbs. Please advise, thank you."
1,Twisted Scripture,"Gwen has some good principles in her book, but she consistently takes scripture out of context. I remember laughing out loud at some of her mix-ups. You WILL lose weight if you follow her method (only eat when your stomach growls), but I think there are much much better ways than waiting until your body tells you-- ""Hey, I'm starving!"" She claims the headaches will eventually go away, but my body must be the exception to the rule because the headaches never went away.I would seriously consider researching (just type Gwen Shamblin and cult into google.com) her before buying this book and contributing to her self-made, self-proclaimed church/movement."
2,I think the author's heart is in the right place but........,"Hi I've read the Weigh Down book, and attended 2 of the weigh down workshop series at a local church. I think the author's heart is in the right place, but the heavy emphasis on guilt when you overeat in both the book, and in the workshops were not helpful to me in maintaining a weight loss. Maybe my view of God as more forgiving or understanding of our human weaknesses than Ms Shamblin's God got in the way. I do think that non Christians would feel uncomfortable with the sometimes heavy handed attitude of ""THE CHRISTIAN WAY IS THE ONLY WAY"". In summary, the approach of eating what you want when you are really hungry, and stopping when you are satisified IS a good one, but I don't believe the possible underlying intolerance is helpful."
3,"Nutritionally Good, Biblically, Not much grace","I have read the book and am doing the Weigh Down workshop - I find that her nutritional principles work very well and I have started losing weight. BUT she doesn't know much about God's Grace and that we are accepted because of Christ - she keeps harping on obedience and self-effort. It is very subtle, but it can again put you on a self-effort rollercoaster."
3,Ideas in this book were right on:I didn't enjoy the delivery,"I really think that weight loss based on biblical truths is a great concept, but I didn't always find Gwen's writing style to be sincere. She seemed to be a little too ""perfect""... I also felt that she oversimplifed the basic chemistry of nutrition to fit ""her"" program. I am reading a similar book by D. Hampton which is more straight forward. It gets to the point in a way that I can relate to and makes me want to follow God's plan.....not Gwen's plan."
1,"I've read it twice, been to WD workshop...","This is a frightening approach to weight loss. While as a Christian I believe God is personally there for me, I doubt he means for me to totally abdicate common sense to the rumblings of my stomach and cravings. It is dangerous to advocate, as the author does in tapes from her workshop, that what one eats doesn't matter. (She tells the story of a man who ate little in the way of fruits and vegetables and he's fine now, she says. What's fine about such an unbalanced died.) It's dangerous to say it really doesn't matter if one exercises or not. God didn't give millions of nutritionists, doctors and exercise professionals the brains to analyze information just to have one woman tell us we're reading the Bible inaccurately. Skip the diet plan and go straight to Scripture. The answers in there, not in Weight Down, another evangelical approach to personalized religion masking more 'Christian' self-absorption."
4,IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE BUT....,"I liked this film, however the reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the girl that played mother of Bow Wow's child was very annoying, in my opinion she was not needed in movie but otherwise still a good movie with a great message."
1,Where is my movie?,"I am yet to receive the movie, I am still waiting to receive it, so I can't review yet. Please can someone let me know what is going on please? I will appreciate it, thank you in advance."
3,Movie,"I gave it only 3 stars because I have seen better movies done by Tyler Perry. Too Much profanity for my liking, could have been better without it."
4,FUNNY!!!!,"I love this movie for many reason's,it's funny,it make's you mad,and it makes you sad.I love Tyler,and his work.But to sum it up in a way so i won't spoil the movie for people who have not watched it yet,its basically about this mother,who has a bit of an issue going on.I wont say what is the issue because i do not want to spoil it for you.But all i can say,is the mother want's to get the family together,now you would come to think that would be an easy task,but it's not.I wont say more,but i will say i did see this movie,i do not own it yet,but i will soon.When it comes to movies i do not cry but this one actually made me cry,laugh,and have fun.All in all i say buy it,its a great movie,if you wanna have a good fun movie to your collection."
4,What a Family,"Just like many others, I too have had issues with some of Tyler Perry's movies and their depiction of black people. However, funny is funny and Madea's Big Happy Family is flat out, laugh out loud funny. The movie is well cast and well acted and many sequences effectively serve as social commentary. Bow Wow in particular does well and demonstrates that he has come a long way since his first movie role. As per usual, Loretta Devine adds class, style and substance to every film she has a part in. Even TP as Madea appears to be less of a caricature in this film than in her other forays onto the big screen. All-in-all, MBHP demonstrates that TP is growing as both a film-maker and story-teller. I would recommend that people, especially those who are critical of Mr. Perry give it a try."
2,Not Tyler Perry's Best Movie,I normally support Tyler Perry and all his productions... but this movie falls well below his standards. I felt the movie was rushed; several characters went beyond exaggeration to irritation; and many questions were unanswered with new issues being introduced at the end! I just hope there is not a Part II in the works. Loretta Devine CARRIED this movie and that is the only reason I have given it 2 stars. If someone has never seen Madea or Uncle Joe or the marajuana jokes; then maybe they would laugh out loud at the antics. But to continually put out the same mannerisms and anticipated antics (to the 25th power) was just plain irritating. I am so glad I didn't go to the theaters to see this movie and I will probably purchase the DVD only when it goes on clearance. Two thumbs down and I wish I had more thumbs.
5,Turn a negative into a positive,"This movie is based on a play that was written shortly after Mr. Perry's mother has passed. From bereavement, he created a play and movie that offers hope to many families that have gone through tragedy and pulled through into a stronger one. This is easier said than done: however, Mr. Perry's life is testament that it can and is possible. I look forward to many more of his films. God bless."
4,Madea's Big Happy Family,"Great movie! My favorite character was the girl saying ""By - reeeeeeen"" working everyone's nerves. lol If you like Tyler's work, you'll most likely like this one too. :)"
1,Don't bother with this one . . .,"Tyler Perry must be getting lazy. This movie is a patchwork of storylines from previous movies, and the characters are so over the top that I actually found myself wincing. There are no shades of gray in this movie--the characters are either irritating, bickering ingrates or noble heroes. I've generally been a fan of Tyler Perry's movies, but he's losing his touch. Madea's character is little more than a cartoon, and Brown may be the most irritating character since JarJar Binks. How many time can they mispronounce words and it still be funny? When you have to resort to Maury Povich for a finale, you know something's going wrong. This movie is a total disaster."
1,Ridiculous,"I only got through 10 minutes of this film, it was that bad. I was looking forward to a humorous, at times thought-provoking story line, but this was just a waste of time, even the ten minutes I gave it. Madea's character is way over the top, and it seems like Tyler Perry just keeps re-making the same movie, except each time its a little worse. I love Diary of a Mad Black Woman and The Family that Preys. This movie is not good."
5,Hilarious,"I laughed and laughed. I bought it for my sister but have to have myself now. Great movie, sad ending, just sayin."
5,Great buy,Love love love tyler perry movies and needed to continue my collection. Great condition and a great price would recommend
1,terrible,This was a terrible waste of time and money -- I think Tyler is getting lazy ! He must have just threw things at a dart board to come up with something the stereo types get so over the top and story was so confusing --- This was a sad comparison to other movies what a disappoint
4,More of Madea.. please.,"I loved this film, just as I love everything Tyler Perry has done.I agree with the first reviewer, there weren't many positive women in this film and the men did seem to be pretty lame.However, it's a comedy, and when Madea comes on it's laughter all the way for me. I own all of Mr. Perry's movies and plays and will buy this one too.It doesn't bother me to see the negative side of family, I have a family with alot of drama and negative and violent things happened to at least one of us. It's reality for some people. I think that's what Tyler Perry draws on. With God, we can hold on to the hope and promise of something better. That's why I buy his movies and plays, he is not shy about sharing God's word, even if at it's misquoted by Madea."
5,Madea's Big Happy Family,"We like Tyler Perry's Madea movies. My children not too crazy about the Play's, but I do because he tends to get off the script and say what is on his mind about how things are and just appears to a down to earth kind of guy."
4,Entertaining and funny,This was a great movie and as with all of Mr. Perry's movies it had message to offer. The movie at the beginning has somewhat of a corny beginning....but stay with it. The movie gets better and you can't help laughing even though it does have a sad moment.
2,Madea's Big Happy Family Review,This movie has some funny scenes in the beginning but I was bored through most of it. I would only recommended to fans of Tyler Perry.
3,Not Perry's best,"Madea strikes again! Though there are funny lines throughout, the adlibbing seems endless & takes away from the film's quirky charm in dealing with a sensitive subject."
4,Madea's still funny,"This movie had some great one liners. I'd still like to see Tyler stretch the characters a bit more, but there's only so much time people will spend watching a movie. It's a good movie, with some good life lessons and ""words of wisdom""."
5,Good movie!,"This the funnniest movie, I laughed so hard my stomach muscles hurt. Some of the characters were a little silly but overall it had some pretty good messages about taking of your health, watching your diet,and getting regular check-ups. Great meaasages,Excellent movie!!!"
3,"Ok, but too much profanity...","The story was shallow and had way, way more foul language (profanity) than was comfortable for myself or my family to watch. It could have been so much deeper and cleaner, which would have made for a more tasteful film."
1,Disappointment,"I was really excited when ""Madea's Big Happy Family"" came. I am one of Tyler's biggest fans, but...forget this one. The Previews took about ten minutes. Then about twenty minutes of the beginning of the movie were given to Public Sevice Announcement that black men need to get their colonoscopy using Mr. Brown. The Public Service Announcements work on his TV shows but we don't need it in movies. Don't expect ""Family Reunion"" which I loved. Don't expect ""Diary.."" which I loved. Don't expect ""Meet the Browns-the movie"" which I watched over and over. This movie was just like a couple of TV episodes. The only thing memorable about this movie was the woman who sang at Sister Shirley's funeral. What a voice! Tyler, baby, slow down and return to quality."
1,Terrible movie,"This was the worst Tyler Perry movies I ever watched, Madeas Big Happy Family was such a let down. The cast is a talented group of actors to bad the writing didn't reflect it. Madea's rants in this movie were over the top, long and boring it had no posative message. There were a few lines that were funny and the Murry Povich scenes were for the most part spot on but over all this movie sucked. I wigh I had just rented it for a $1 instead of buying it."
3,Not impressed,"First, the bags are too large, second the belt doesn't fit any normally sized person, third there aren't nearly enough small pockets for small hand tools. I'm an electrician and made the mistake of getting these bags. If you are a framer or something like that they may work better for you. But if you use a lot of small hand tools this is NOT the way to go."
4,A fairly objective account,"I liked this book because it is fairly objective in its account of the US invasion in 1983 in Grenada. Though the book justifies the American invasion it does not cast Maurice Bishop in a totally negative light. It also shows the Cubans as reluctant adversaries: they were backers of Bishop but were forced into supporting the Junta that overthrew and assassinated him. Also, the US intervention is shown as not all that well executed: there were many fiascos and unecessary casualties in a relatively small war. The photos of the book are clear and the colour plates are also nicely done."
1,Confusing rip off,"The instructions are horrible and way above the head of the targeted age group. FURTHERMORE, THE BOX SAYS REMOTE CONTOLLED- MAYBE SO, BUT WHILE IT ALSO SAYS VEHICLES NOT INCLUDED- IT DOESN'T SAY- VEHICLES ARE A NECESSARY SEPERATE OPTION TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL.Christmas morning was not as happy as it should have been."
3,Unique,"The band has a distinct flavor, but songs tend to meander. It gets old after a while.This is good background music."
5,Best Band in all the Land,When i first heard Samus Octology i was shocked as to how amazing it was. I instantly told everyone i knew about it and it caught on like wild fire. If you dont own this cd your sleeping so get it and listen to the best damn atmospheric progressive instrumental music ever put to cd.
4,Finally...,a great book about subclassing and the actions you can achieve using vb and not c++. Helped me built customized apps for certain strict environments in no-time. Good work!
3,another gate widenning the basis for living cyclical symbols,"this is another brick of cultural basis regarding the oracular mentality in action after the codification of the IJING during the Han dynesty. I've found the book 'workable' enough and more; Still, there are some mistakes regarding the graphic attributions to the text; moreover - as a historical textbook, asserting the flow of seasons and a specific arena of anciant chinese polity - the prospect of ""modern"" usage is quite limited but with a pointed analogy to the more formal Chinese atmosphere of a confucian cleric in the first century A.D; thus, i would like to see this book as being the first in a row of unfoldment-vehicles of symbols unto our era as ""users"". Keep On Translating this!!"
4,It really works,"The flashlights arrived discharged, charged quickly, and have held their charge.They throw an amazing amount of light.Highly recommended and I have bought more.I would prefer these less bulky. They're big to carry keys in a pocket."
3,"O.K but,..","Needs to be recharged under bright sunlight. The 3 bulb models might be brighter. Other models give a dim light when the battery is low. This one may not work. Not such a bad product, but other products in the market may be better."
2,This is NOT a book!,"I love Jack Addington but I was very dissapoited when this Item arrived in the mail. It is accually a brocier-not a book! Its strange he titled it ""Your miracle book"". Dont pay more than a doller including shipping if you get it. If it was accually a book I would give it 5 stars."
5,Island Princess Monkey,I ordered this for my granddaughter and when it arrived my 27yr old daughter wanted to keep it. She thought it was so cute. She likes monkeys. My grandaughter went nuts over it and slept with it that night. I would buy this again if I needed to.
3,Barbie Island Princess Character,"This was a gift to my grandchild. She was unfamiliar with the character but found it endearing. My rating is average only because I do not have knowledge of its durability, quality or educational value."
2,Dissapointed,"Hoped that this would be a history of Astrology and why people believed in it. Berlinski writes ""all over the place"", jumping from one idea to the next. He sort of was getting to some good history but I just ran out of patience. My feeling is, he writes for himself and not for his readers."
4,k,cool but a little pricey for the make and material used and would not recamend to others there are better choises out there for less money
1,Cheap replacement waster valves,Black valve had a grey handle and the grey valve was a darker grey than the black. Won't do that again.
3,A few good tracks,"""A Namorada"" by Carlinhos Brown has a good beat but it's the song ""Make Tonight Beautiful"" by Tamia that is worth the price alone. The beautiful lyrics and voice of Tamia is the perfect song to dedicate to the one you love."
1,Buy this for Sak's theme.,"This soundtrack is probably bought more today than when the movie was out, for it contains the sought-after entrance music of the world's greatest fighter, Kazushi Sakuraba. His theme on the CD is the TK Remix, buy it for that. The movie was terrible, but at least the soundtrack redeems itself somehow."
5,Truly a joyful symphony,"Ludolf Nielsen's fame hasn't been helped by the presence of a contemporaneous namesake that was far more famous: Carl Nielsen. Yet, this is totally different music; think of a more light-hearted Stenhammar. There are the same late romantic large gestures and structures, but it is of more immediate impact. With this 'Symphony of Joy"" Nielsen is in his element. Here is some of the most optimistic music of the age. Of the four movements, three are slow ones, and the one scherzo not particularly fast at that. Yet the finale (lento) erupts into a near-hallucinogenic experience (not entirely unlike some recent film music). The Berceuse and Lyrisk Nocturne are worthwile fillers, but they don't reach the same exalted level of the symphony. Ole Schmidt and the RSO Frankfurt deliver an inspired and lucid performance. The CD is accompanied by the usual encyclopedic notes from CPO."
2,Doesnt last long,"Though it served a purpose. Everyone in my family was dragging in their stereos. Being the paranoid mom I am, I didnt like my younger kids using their stereos plugged in while in the shower/bath. So I opted to purchase a cordless cd player.It didnt last long, it sucks the life out of batteries so fast, dies quickly.. Now it goes outside while we are in the garden but after it dies for the first time, we just dont mess with it again..I would opt against buying this item...."
1,Do NOT Purchase!!!,"Shower radio did not pick up not one FM/AM station in the shower, beside the window or even on my back porch."
4,Shower CD Radio,We use this for AM reception only.... never for CD's or FM. Takes 8 AA batteries to run. Reception depends on your location - ours is fair but I would not rate it lower just because of our location. Looks good on the shower rod.
1,terrible...do not buy,"this product is extremely disapointing. first of all, its huge, its about the size of shoe box, and hard to find a place for. Also, it takes 8 aa batteries. and, it doesnt even work right. It will only play songs about halfway through, and then cut off, and start as if you had taken the cd out. All in all, i would never buy this product again, and think it is very dated, and unusable. however, i need to say that amazon handled the return very well."
1,doesnt work,radio gets bad reception battery life is terrible the cd player will only play half a song and then turn off dont buy
5,Excellent! Super comfortable!,They are absolutely wonderful. I used the sizing from another pair of Clarks and these fit perfectly. Definitely recommend.
2,Beware of the Dog,"Man - being a huge Status Quo fan since the seventies, I never thought they could release an album this bad - but they did ! The band doesn't even sound, like they are having fun doing this. The song selection is poor and at the end of the CD you can't help but asking yourself, what the....? Quo used to do some bad ass cover versions in their past, like 'Junior's Wailing', 'Bye Bye Johnny', 'Carol' or 'Roadhouse Blues'. But this album sounds like your local 'cover band' on a bad night. Stay away from it and buy anything these guys have released between 1972 and 1985. (Start with 'Whatever you Want', 'Hello' or their fantastic double Live album)."
4,"An old recording, but clear and very moody","The Alun Francis recording is newer, and one can hear fine details which are not heard in this older recording. But I feel that this older recording has more clearly defined moods:- the quiet, very sad passages to which the music frequently returns, is compassionate and therapeutic. The biting end is masterfully performed, but with more emotion than with Francis. Both versions offer an arduous experience, for Pettersson never fails to take us to the most harrowing landscapes."
4,The Star Guide,"While The Star Guide is far from comprehensive, it does provide a nice, usable introduction to the night sky. It is a bit thin on the basic concepts of astronomy, providing only the barest introduction to the processes behind what we see. It does, though, provide admirable resources for a beginner's search of the heavens - brief introductions to various constellations, seasonal and monthy sky highlights and, perhaps best of all, a planisphere that allows one to immediately access a map of the current sky."
5,Great Metal!!,"If your a Death Metal fan and you don't own this, your insane! Phil and the guys deliver another awesome album.Lets go into the fire!Infernal desire!!"
4,This is Arnold,"Engaging tale about the life of Arnold. As a long-time fan I was interested. About his growing-up life, his parents, his brother and his interest in body-buildiong. He had a stint in the Army as a tank driver, he skipped out to go compete.He trains in Germany and then starts winning competetions. Mentions some of the bodybuilders he admires. Comes to the U.S. and gets into showbusiness. Meets and marries Maria. Talks about how with each movie the $ decreased. Talks about his difficult relationship with Sly Stalone, they went back and forth at each other.Goes into his run for Govenor and that he was accused of womamizing. He spoke at the GOP convention. Written way before any mention of his love child. That fact kinda hollows it out. Does contain a load of information for Arnold fans."
4,"Britney, Paris, pick up this book!","I picked up this book hoping to gain some insight on someone who had realized so many goals and dreams. Arnold wanted to greatest bodybuilder in the world, Hollywood's biggest star, and then governor. Through each pursuit, he was mocked and ridiculed but we all know how Arnold laughed at the end.The book really gives us the reader a candid and personal look at Arnold's upbringing and was refreshingly unbiased. This book awakened me to how much Arnold has risen from Mr. Olympia and Conan ... an almost national joke ... to overcome his detractors to become governor of California and who knows what else he decides to become."
5,A bit of skill needed,"It helps if you have some basic drawing skills before you try this book. Great concepts and ideas. It is more advanced than some of the beginer books, but if you have those skills it is great. If you are buying a book for a kid that has no drawing skills yet but loves to try to draw these type of things, try ""How to Draw Tanks and Fighting Machines"" also sold at Amazon. It is more accessible than this one. To see more drawing books for kids you might want to check my lists on the subject. I will add a picture of the book cover above since it does not have one at this time."
4,Big and beautiful,"Keane's 'Somewhere Only We Know' is a catchy record that approaches true grandeur. Its melodies are memorable and it builds to some thrilling crescendoes. Its song structure is odd (two verses, then two alternating choruses) and the lead singer has a high, Freddy Mercury sort of charisma. The production is clean, if overly digital sounding. I recommend this one song by Keane. The rest of their stuff seems less memorable to me, but this one is a keeper."
3,ermmm Coldplay wannabe???,"sound more likely to Coldplay, but Coldplay is far better then them. Somewhere Only We Knew is a nice song but its not worthed to spend your money to buy this CD"
4,Dan Sweeney Knows his music folks!,"""These guys remind me of Travis (circa ""The Man Who"") not Coldplay as the other reviewer incorrectly suggested.""Who says that. Are you trying to prove your music superiority over other reviewers? Who cares man. Don't tell people you are postmodern."
4,Chasing Dreams,"This beautifully written tale of Clorina is inspirational and encouraging. It is about a cow that wants to dance ballet. Of course, this is difficult to do when you are a cow. But she perseveres and works hard until she manages to reach her dreams. But things don't turn out they way she had hoped...This witty story is charming and contains a good message about working for the things you really want...and knowing when something just isn't going to work for you.The Illustrations: The artwork is beautiful and expressive. Nicely outlined and detailed, the pictures in Clorinda draw the reader in and enhance the overall story."
2,Essentially a not-quite-as-good rewrite of Dumpy La Rue,"Clorinda is a light-hearted kids' book, set to verse, about a free-spirited barnyard animal who overcomes criticism of peers to become a ballet dancer, eventually leading other animals in a highly touted barnyard ballet. Nothing wrong with that.But, there is another book, by another author, written before Clorinda, which meets the EXACT SAME DESCRIPTION. Go read (...)Dumpy La Rue(...) instead. The two books have the same style of writing, the same plot and the same feel. But Dumpy is the original and the better book."
2,New,"After all these years waiting to see what happend, I have to admit I was kind of disappointed.The story lines were the same as always.Amanda gets kidnapped, another attempt on her life, Peter wants her back. yadayadayada. The twist she now wants a baby.Another murderer moves in to the apt complex.And long time Character Billy leaves the show.I loved Melrose place BUT you can see why they ended the show since the writing started to go down hill."
3,The worst season after season 1...,"But if the editors decided to give us the episodes as shown during the original TV airings, I might change my mind about it and decide to buy these sets."
1,They have no good lyrics.,The ghetto twiinz as ugly as they are have no good lyrics or anything commin' from themselves if you want a hot fem-cee crew get nananuf.
4,Brief but interesting!,"This book contains about 200 latin quotes that have been translated into English. It is broken down into topics such as ""Politics,"" ""Money,"" and ""Love."" If you have an interest in Latin or Roman philosophy in general, this is an interesting read. I think this book would provide a good jumping off point in the study of any particular Roman philosopher, since it can help you to gain a sense of the ideas of Seneca or Syrus, for instance."
3,Be careful in the woods,"This was a hard book to rate. The suspense was really great and at least a 5. If it wasn't for the suspense I would have quit reading long ago. The story line was good and the fantasy fun. I don't know who edited this book but the grammar was atrocious. The extreme overuse of clichés was terrible and really distracted me from the story. In fact the author was a big distraction in reading the book. But the biggest problem was the things he had a 14 year old boy do and say. It really distracted from an otherwise good book. It was obviously written ""down"" to a 14 year old by an adult and not presented as a 14 year old looking ""up."" So I would say it was a good story but not a good read. But I would say it was worth reading but just be prepared for some a writing style that might not be what you are used to. It is also worth reading so you can get to other books in the series that do improve in the writing area and story keeps the great suspense."
4,Jimmy Fincher - Boy Hero!,"Jimmy Fincher is a fourteen year old boy who loves sports and hates cooked peas. And in his own words he ""absolutely, positively cannot be destroyed"".So begins A Door in the Woods, James Dashner's premier novel and Book One of The Jimmy Fincher Saga. What follows the intriguing opening paragraph is a slightly scary, high-action adventure story with elements of fantasy and science fiction and a firm focus on family.From the mysterious Givers to the creepy Shadow Ka and the ominous warning that ""The Stompers are coming"", Dashner shows his gift for storytelling as the pages fly by. Readers of any age or gender will be cheering for Jimmy Fincher every step of the way in this highly exciting book!"
5,Imagination like none other,"I'm currently reading the last Jimmy Fincher books with my children, and they can't get enough, begging me for another chapter before bed! Dashner has the most unique imagination I've ever read. He takes the world as we know it, turns it upside down, and then you have to hold on tight for the ride. Each book is better than the one before, so while I really liked Door in the Woods, I love War of the Black Curtain."
1,Horrible book,"This is the second book I have bought on the strength of previous reviewers rave notices, both have been horrible. Dashner must have friends who were willing to commit perjury to sell his book. The characters are one dimensional stereotypes of real people. What plot there is is incoherent, disjointed and confusing, with holes big enough to drive a semi-truck through. I got the impression throughout the book that the author's prime purpose in writing this book is to sell the sequel, hence all the hints about what is going to happen in the future. Don't buy this book. Don't check it out of the library. Read something worthwhile."
4,Charles Dickens - A Christmas Carol,The CD arrived in top notch condition. The recording is not quite as I remember it but time has a way of doing that to us senior citizens! thanks for the speedy delivery. Have a good day and be blessed.
4,PRETTY GOOD!!!,"bands sound is very much in tune with the times then...i think you will like it, give it a try!...just do yourself a favor, and steer clear of this other group who calls themselves ""the merry go-round"", ugggh, the worst...ever! but these guys are a-ok."
5,Metcalf's Family and Frontier in Colonial Brazil,This is the definitive work on the role of family in colonial Brazil. No understanding of Brazilian history is complete without it.
4,"Well-written, informative, and less dry than it could've been","If you're a clinical social worker, you should own this book. Chances are, it'll be assigned to you at some point in your degree program anyway. Might as well buy it to have it on-hand for when that happens. Plus, you'll need it to study for your licensure exam. Buy it, read it, enjoy it, and learn from it."
5,Perfect for the chef...or the mechanic...,"This is my favorite all-round product. Great in the kitchen to get garlic, fish or other smell away from hands after cooking. Will clean my kids feet after a day at the park or at the beach (even cleans away tar). I even use it for scuff marks on white walls!!"
5,Works just as advertised.,"I use it to shave my beard down to a low stubble, so it has a fairly easy life. And it's holding up nicely, shaving comfortably."
4,Great Book!,"I am currently reading this book and find it to fit me exactly. I have been ill for 2 years now with not exactly sure what. Everything in the book relates to me, my life, my history, my illness and it is written where anyone can understand. I would highly recommend it to someone who feels they may be suffering from CFS."
1,the glass lip broke off as soon as I unpacked it,"I could not believe it, as right before my eyes, it broke as soon as it was out of the box! Now, it would probably cost me more to ship it back than to keep it. You do NOT want to get me started on the dripping problem! Major disappointment and loss of investment, can not even find a way to return it. ugh. Stay away, stay far far awsy from this one."
2,Surface color peels off,"In an effort to keep our feeders clean, I wash them regularly. When I washed this one, the red color started peeling off, since it is on the outer surface only. It still works, and hummingbirds are attracted to it and use it, but it drips excessively (as other reviewers have noted)."
2,Beautiful but useless,"Just like previous customers, I loved the colored glass and its shape. Unfortunately, this is all that is great about this feeder. It drips constantly. When I finally arranged its position so it would stop dripping, air prevented liquid from flowing freely and birds could not get their sweet food, at all. Now, I am looking for another hummingbird feeder, one that works well."
1,Drips Constantly,"FYI - I purchased one similar. Yes, it's prettier than most hummingbird feeders BUT it constantly drips."
1,Beautiful but useless,"Sadly, this beautiful product is too difficult to use. Vaccum, schmackum. It's a pain. In order to create a vacuum you must fill the glass with over 2 cups of sugar water. The hummingbirds need to be the size of elephants to go through that much solution. In the heat of the summer more sugar water gets thrown out (or drips out if you can't get the stopper placed quite right) than can be used by the birds. And if you stuggle with the stopper while filling the feeder all that sugar water ends up on your kitchen floor. Ugh."
1,pretty but doesn't work,"I like the appearance of the pretty glass feeder but could not get it to work! The sugar liquid drips out, making a mess on our porch. I cleaned it, shook it, adjusted it, all to no avail. So, I pulled out my old plastic feeder. Very disappointed with this product."
5,Hindemith Complete Cello Concertos,"This recording of Hindemith's complete concertos for cello and orchestra neatly collects three important and diverse works in one unique package. In fact, this is the only available recording of his Concerto in E flat, Op. 3. This early work is extremely difficult, and David Geringas, a phenominal Rostropovich protege, executes this Straussian/Wagnerian composition marvelously. The recording of the other two concertos are equally exciting, with driven tempi and interperatation. The full bodied accompaniment for these works is supplied in equally charged performances by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra."
2,Disappointment as a photography guide,"I was hoping to photograph some old ghost towns in the U.P. so I felt this book would help direct me to interesting sites. I hate to be so negative about a local topic but it did not even start to meet my expectations. The book is not easy to read even as interesting history. The book will not give you many details on how to find ghost town artifacts. Most of the book details the growth and death of towns. However, most of these are very short in length and are very dry in the telling. Many of the book's details leave off in the early 70's."
3,"Lots of history, but no maps","I bought this book (6th Reprint, 1996) to use as a reference on a road trip to the Keweenaw Peninsula on the upper peninsula of Michigan. One of the objectives of my trip was to explore some abandoned copper mining towns. The book turned out to be of very limited usefulness, and certainly not a stand-alone guidebook. It provides at least a bit of history (mostly resident names culled from old Post Office records) about each of hundreds of different ghost towns. But there are no maps showing where any particular ghost town is located. Nor is there an index. To look up a particular ghost town, first you need to know which county it's in, since the listings are organized by county (one chapter per county). For most town entries, there's absolutely no description of where they're located; you will need to get that information somewhere else.For a more concise listing of U.P. ghost towns and their locations, do a web search for Ghost Towns of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan."
1,Not what I expected,"This book was a real waste. It wasn't what I expected. As a graphic designer, I felt that much of the information was too basic. Don't waste your money."
5,War of the Running Dogs,"BLUF: This books is MUST read for the Military Historian/Enthusaist and, more to the point, the Politician and Politico. To make a Foreign Internal Defense (FID) or counter insurgency work you need: a viable Host Nation to assist, support of the people you are defending and an understanding of the culture.This forgotten war can still save lives if we would adopt its lessons learned.A good read and most enlightening."
2,Visible seam and blunt point,"Each crystal had a very obvious cast seam down it's whole length. The bottom of each crystal also did not come to a clear point; it was blunt, and obvious.The seller was fast and great; thus the stars."
5,USA lawyer who enjoys English law cases,Always an enjoyable evening with the English barrister. Great acting by all cast members.
2,"Good recording, polished musicianship, but ...","Splendid recording, faultless playing and singing. So why was I left totally unmoved?Factor 'X' is missing, that elusive something which makes a performance take wings, and take you with it. This, I felt, was totally earthbound.I'll try Harnoncourt; he might be eccentric, but you know he's gives his all."
5,100% ok. Thanks.,Recebi a mercadoria sem nenhum problema dentro do prazo que foi estipulado para entrega. Vendedor recomendado. Produto de qualidade. obrigado.
4,Fantastic Espresso Machine,"To the point... Could not fine support for any questions I had through the Briel Company in the USA. The phone number in the espresso machine help book was Out Of Service. The instruction book, I feel needs more pictures to help individuals locate and understand usage of the espresso machine than what Briel offers. (Example) You need to turn the ON Switch fully to the right until you here a Click or the Machine will not brew and acts like it has a Vapor Lock which it doesn't. This why Briel gets only four stars from me. The Briel ES200APG-TB is really a Great Machine as long as you fully understand it's operation. I would recommend this product to my friends."
2,JP in Calif,"Less than 2 years old now, very light use. (office only) Blows water out around porta filter. Found the only authorized shop to repair these machines are on the east coast. With shipping and repairs cost over $200.00. They said the gaskets were worn out and the boiler support needed replacing. I have a Gaggia at home and have never had any problems."
4,Great machine and service,"I bought this machine to replace an older model of the same machine that served me well for many years. With that machine, I learned that the Briel is a wonderful machine for someone who is willing to work a bit to adjust the machine settings for a personalized espresso. It is not for the user that wants to push a button and be done. I knew this when purchasing this machine. Yet, as first I could not get the espresso to flow through the filter basket despite many attempts. I knew the machine was working fine, but I must be doing something wrong. Since I live near by, I called the service center to ask if I could come by, and they were very helpful on the phone and welcomed my visit. There, the owner came by and promptly stepped up and plugged my machine in. He spent about a half hour with me, and we found the right filter basket and right adjustment for a perfect flow. Thank you Steve! This is a great machine but may take some personal adjusting at first."
3,Great collection of information of history,"The author is a hard working person. So it's very convinient for readers to read the aspect of hitory. However, it's merit also is it's weakness. We could not get any personal viewpoint of the author. We could only get the results of author's research."
5,This Game Rocks Buy NOW,"This game takes Resident Evil to the next level!The graphics are amazing and the weapons and gameplay makes it a perfect gift for mature people. This game contains alot of graphic violence and gore. Do not buy for the quezy.Otherwise the game is a work of art.Im 14 and I Loved This GameThe Collectors tin is very detailed but a bit fragile. The ""Leon"" laser cell is awsome.If you are going to buy JUST WAIT FOR PS2 VERSION.NEW WEAPONS NEW LASER CELL AND NEW BOOKLET"
5,Da kine is FUNNY stuffs!,Many times I laughed so hard that I blew Heineken out da nose. Gotta know da local kine speak to get da full effect.
5,Wonderful product,"This was one of the recommended products from my dermatologist. I have never used serums before, but I really like it. It goes on smooth and absorbs right away. It seems more like a gel than a slimey serum. It's nice feeling. The most important part is that my skin looks very clear and pretty. Almost radiant. I am now on my second bottle (they last a long time) and I will continue to use it. The price on amazon is dramatically lower than any other online store."
1,Negative results.,"Don't feel or see any improvement, I've had better results with Avon products. Maybe more usage is needed to see results."
2,Not satisfied,I used the product twice a day for two weeks and did not notice a significant difference in wrinkles or the texture of my skin.
3,You would think more then three days,"I purchased this for to replace a worn out battery for my Kodak camera. Traveling to the Philippines I thought that this would keep my back up camera charge for the time i was to be there. Well, after two days it was discharged, with approximately 30 photos in bright light so no flash needed. Very disappointing none the less because if I were to be out on a hike unable to charge the battery it would be totally useless."
3,Not too bad,"As long as you get these at the right price they're ok. They definitely don't last as long as the original, but they work."
4,Midnite Lover,"I am a new fan of Shaggy's music. Midnite Lover was the first Shaggy CD that I've ever purchased. After listening to it, at least 50 times in seven days, I immediatley began looking for other CDs by this artist. It is, indeed, a shame that this fine artist does not get the recognition he deserves in the USA! I am not a cross over Reggae fan. Shaggy, thank you for keeping romance alive!!!"
4,Meh..,"Pretty good for the price. My only hang up is that there is no definitive bass control, just DTS Pro Logic controls. But, still a good deal"
1,"Scratch ""Complete"" from the Title","Very disappointed. I have a 950 page book that does not cover setting up an IOS router for remote access using PPTP or L2TP. WTF? Heck - that's why I bought this expensive book. If you have deep pockets and can buy whatever cisco gear you like then this book will likely introduce you to many possible VPN solutions. But there seems to be a bias in the book toward large enterprise solutions - with little or no consideration given to SOHO and small businesses. Many of us make do with the resources that we have available and can't just go out a buy stuff because the author thinks a remote access concentrator would be ""best."" I still can't believe that he doesn't cover configuring IOS for access by Windows PPTP or L2TP clients. I'm stunned. With this glaring omission I can't help but wonder about the completeness of the other content. Thumbs down."
3,I returned it because the vibrate function is too weak to wake me up.,"I picked up this watch because of the vibration function. I tested it out and found the vibration to be rather weak. Plus it vibrates 8 or 10 times then stops. You cannot customize this function. If it vibrated indefinitely when the alarm goes off until I turned it off manually, I would have kept the watch. I returned it. If you are not using this to wake you up, it is a useful vibrate function. I believe that only one or two of the 5 alarms can be customized to vibrate. Casio makes great watches, but the designs can be idiosyncratic.It is relatively easy to use, whereas other Casio vibrating watches reviewed seems to be more difficult to setup."
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought this to work with a Hapton Bay Hawkins fan... It doesn't. After messing with it for 2 hours my husband and I finally gave up and are returning it to the Home Depot where we bought it. If it says Universal, it should be Universal. And the directions should at least be king of helpful. Don't waste your money on this remote..."
4,Good basic remote,"1. Installation is not hard if you have any aptitude for wiring. I have installed this unit with Hampton Bay and Hunter fans. Can be a snug fit in the fan housing. Tie wraps are handy to keep the wiring under control.2. I have three remotes on three fans. I too have noticed one of my fans turning on randomly! It is the fan where I did not change the factory default remote code setting. Most likely there is some other wireless device nearby that is interfering (I live in a condo). If I change the setting to some other channel the problem will probably go away.3. The 12v battery is an ""A23"" type and available at any chain drug store. You'll pay through the nose for one -- $6! I found better deals on ebay, less that $1 per battery for qty 5, though it took two weeks for them to arrive (shipped from Hongkong).4. I wish they sold the remote handheld unit separately with a wall mount kit. I'd put one by each entry door if I could."
1,Poor value for a poor product,The instructions are horrible. The remote is small. They only tell you on the back of the package it requires a 12v battery- which any normal person does not have. I returned it.
1,Sucks,Doesn't fit in housing of fan . . . says it works with all brands of ceiling fan. Waste of money.
3,So so,"This watch looks nicer in the picture than it actually does. Not sure how it works, but the look is disappointing."
5,Why haven't you bought this?,"Ok, I'll admit that the Geraldine Fibbers probably won't appeal to everyone. There's people out there who wants the genres well-divided and can't handle the thought of something as complex as this, but if you're one of the few willing to expand their boundaries (or disregard the boundaries altogether), the GF will not disappoint. The album brims with fear, resentment, longing and anger brought to life through Bouzlich's voice and Cline's violins. This is country after dark--the trailer trash, the boozy men, the tomboy, etc.; There is an almost voyeuristic quality to it. You will not soon forget this album..."
3,Not fully realized,"If the above reviewer felt this was not the Marias book to start with, I would love to know why.This, the first novel by Marias that I've read, seemed a work that stalled at impressive effort without making it to graceful coherence. The author's afterword does more to elucidate with a confession of intention than all the book's detailed but ultimately unrevealing waffling."
3,"Great concept, but flawed!","I bought these and they really do enhance the overall sound and bass without losing any treble or mids, but these buds wont stay on my phones. I will need to stick them with superglue."
1,Won't stay on,"The sound enhances will not stay on- they fall off, of stay in your ear when you remove the earbuds. I noticed little sound enhancement - VERY disappointed- they do not conform to earbuds at all"
3,Boogiepop sans the boogie,"The cd itself was in excellent shape and arrived in a timely fashion. My disappointment lay in the content of the the cd. I was given the impression by the description that the opening song would be included and sadly it was not. Unfortunately, my money was wasted."
3,Adequate,"Although the back of the case claims both films have been remastered in high definition, I doubt it. In fact they seem to be the exact same single disc versions that were previously available. ""My Stepmother is an Alien"" is still full frame here, which is suspect for a film that would have been remastered in 2009-2010. Aside from that the picture quality is pristine. ""Blind Date"" is presented in its original 2:35 aspect ratio, and though perfectly watchable by 480p standards, it's clearly at least a ten year-old transfer (again, same disc as before). Considering you get two unique movies I'd say it's worth a buy if you're a fan of either one. Still, shame on Sony for the false advertising, or their incompetent graphic design department."
4,compatible here compatible there,"i really appreciated the fact that this cam is compatible with both my pc and my mac. i really switch back and forth w/ my preference, so it was good to be able to take my cam with me. additionally, the images are pretty quality, but a little grainy. however, for the price and the convienence... this cam is definietly great. additionally, its a cute cam, and comes in a few different colors that will suit varying tastes and such."
3,"not bad,but...",It's very cute! but I think the image is a little dark.........I will buy another one for better image...
1,The review of one who hasn't read it yet,"Meister Eckhart once said that if no one had been in the church, he would have had to preach his sermon to the offering-box. He also saw God as ""glowing and flaming"" and as ""playing,"" some of which got him in trouble with the inquisition. I look forward to seeing whether ""15 Days of Prayer"" is really in the true almost ' beyond-Zen spirit of Meister Eckhart, who was so closely identified with God that he hardly saw any difference between God and ourselves."
3,Number systems; structure and properties,I want to see the contents of Number systems; structure and properties. If you please sent by e-mail.Thank you.
5,mellow acid jazz,"I heard song three on an afternoon radio show and immediately had to buy the album. This duo out of Germany has put together an incredible second U.S. effort. The slower songs have an inventive quality and I find myself transfixed by what they do from one transition to the next (ie: on sample #4 above, pay attention to what they mix-in between horn riffs). There are up-beat songs as well and, playing these, you will not be able to sit still. If you buy the CD look for the ""hidden"" song (it comes about 1-1/2 minutes after the supposed last song). It's an up-beat version of another song on the CD with great lyrics. This remains one of the best CDs in my collection."
5,The Ultimate Superman Story!,"This book collects the entire run of Reign of the Supermen. It's a got a long story but it still feels like the story could have gone on longer because it is well paced, interesting and you would wish to see and get to know more the men who tried to replace Superman. Also, it makes you want to know more the reaction of various people and supporting characters regarding the four Supermen. Something this story kind of lacks but the climax does satisfy me."
3,Eh...,"This starts by intoducing an interesting concept: who could replace Superman? Four candidates step up to the task: Superboy, Steel, some guy in a visor, and Cyborg Superman. The problem lies in that the tales of each of them are done by a differnet writer. The result is that the Cyborg stories (written by Dan Jurgens) and the Superboy stories (Karl Kessel) are very well done while the Steel and visor guy stories are horrid. Cyborg's master plot is entertaining and the saving grace of this book. Inevitably, Superman returns, and though I've read it several times, I'm still not sure how. At any rate, Mongul is defeated in a spectacular battle, but that can't make up for the fact that half the issues in here are horrible. Even if they weren't, the inconsistancy from issue to issue would still be noticable and frankly, annoying. Don't buy this unless you feel you have to."
4,I recommend it,"If you are like me and read comics for the story, then you will appreciate this. It is the complete story line for superman returns. I don't need to look for different comic books to get the full story. This has it all."
3,weakest of the three,"Back in the early nineties, DC decided to kill Superman. There was a lot of potential here, though not as much as there would be now. Things were simpler back then. DC was having problems with its main heroes. Volume one killed Superman. Great if only for the idea and the art. Volume two was the Funeral for a Friend storyline. Weaker, but more or less good. At times. And in volume three we have Superman's return, and the introduction of Steel (good character), Superboy (who became something really great in the DC universe), a Superman cyborg, interesting, and finally a blast from the past. Important to the comic book world, if not as good as Marvel's House of M, world of Apocalypse, Loeb's work, Miller's work, or the great Alan Moore's work."
3,Nice sword but scabbard needed glue!,"The sword and scabbard are very nice and perfect for my son's pirate costume which he wears on only a few occassions each year to the Michigan Renaissance Festival. I would have given it a higher rating but the top and bottom parts of the scabbard fell off within minutes of opening the box. This was nothing that a little Gorilla Glue would not fix but the parts should have been glued to stay before the sword was sold. Otherwise,"
1,Rip-Off,"We are having a Pirate themed wedding in April, we had to order certain themed items for the grooms men. One of which was this sword, WE however bought the same sword at BudK for 24.98 on sale (normally 36.99). When we saw this, we could tell that they tried to darken the BudK serial number on the blade. So don't be fooled, order it from BudK and get it at nearly half the price."
4,Awesome Piece,"I love this sword. The blackened parts of the blade make it look authentic and the detail on the handle is cool. But the bead thing that wraps the handle is kind of annoying... otherwise, it's and awesome sword!"
2,below average,"Looking through the table of contents of this book and reading the reviews, one is tempted to think that this book will answer a lot of questions on RF design. Unfortunately, it falls very short. This is a gentle introduction to RF design and lacks enough depth to interest a serious RF designer. Several of the important equations and results are simply stated without a fair level of mathematical rigor and that does leave an empty feeling. I gave it two stars because it does cover a broad range of topics and also explains (with it's usual lack of depth) the Hajimiri-Lee phase noise theory. Don't expect to become an expert on RF IC design after reading this book. A better book would be Razavi's Design of Analog CMOS ICs."
3,level of details is very inconsistent,Overall it is very good book however if you want to learn stuff you want a smooth flow which this book does not offer. The level of details is very inconistent and varies upon authors level of interest or maybe knowledge?
4,Excellent book.,Overall this is a great book on RF circuit design. My only complaints are that the section on PLLs seems difficult to understand (although maybe it's just me) and that the design of voltage controlled oscillators is not discussed (although fixed frequency oscillators are covered).
4,A good book but not deep enough,The book is clear and simple to follow but it's not detailed enough to show the rope.
3,Julie Strain Rocks A Dang Bikini!,"Julie Strain is the best dang thing about this B-movie comedy. Her performance rocks as always. The rest of the dang movie is just your typical bikini movie with lots of T & A. The comedy is never laugh out loud funny, but the women keep the ""film"" afloat. See it if you like Julie Strain and women in dang bikinis."
3,Kind of bare,"Conceptually, this is a great idea. We live in a small space, so a half upside down tree that hangs on the wall was perfect.First, while we were pulling it out of the box, we noticed that one of the hanging brackets had come off. We brushed it off, and figured we could rig something up.Putting it together was a breeze. You connect 2 parts and you're done. But then comes the fluffing. I'm not faulting them for the fluffing, I think that is part of having an artificial tree. But, after an hour of making sure it was as fluffy as it could be, it was still bare. Nothing at all like the picture.Because of our small space, we like the minimalist approach to a tree, so I didn't plan on putting a ton of garland or ornaments on it. If you plan on doing something like that, it will probably be enough to fill in the gaps.Another note - the top (bottom? the part closest to the ceiling) does not have lights.We returned it."
3,Good Sound for a inexpensive kit,"The flat panel speakers are a bit of a gimmick because they are not true ribbon speakers. However, sound quality is clear and only slightly metallic at higher volume.The down-facing subwoofer is very powerful for a small thing.The biggest drawback to this system is that subwoofer and satellite volume is linked. I prefer my old Midiland speaker system which has both a master volume and a subwoofer volume knob. With the CA-3310, in order to control excess boom at high volumes, it is necessary to either adjust tone via equalizer, or jockey between the master volume on the speaker with the Windows-based volume control panel."
5,Little Robots DVD,"We purchased this DVD for our grandson. He wants to watch it everytime he comes to our house. We have had it for quite a while now, and he never gets tired of it. The DVD is cute, but it also teaches good character."
5,You'll Love Agnes Poetry,"This is my favorite band, I own all the albums and love their sound. The music reached in to your soul and you truly can't get enough. Buy this album now while you still can!"
4,Better than 99 percent of the stuff on the radio.,"Also better than 95 percent of what passes as dance music these days. Meaning it's not the same beat over and over for five minutes with the same vocal sample every two seconds for that same five minutes. (DJs are not musicians, folks. Please.) These are actual songs.A cool update of the 80s dance sound. Don't worry about the religious overtones. They are no more likely to convert or annoy you than those of early Simple Minds and U2.A nice Depeche-y feel. Intelligent dance music. Buy it."
4,Mothers in Despair,Circle of Love Over Death is an outstanding book written by Matilde Mellibovsky. It gives true testimonies given by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. Before reading this book I knew nothing about the Argentinian war. This book opened my eyes and made me realize the tragedy that was occuring there. I was shocked to read about the disappearences that were happening. Each testimony showed the pain and suffering that was going on. It also showed how the Mothers and Grandmothers never stopped fighting for answers and justice. I would definatly recommend this book.
3,A Tragic Story,"Circle of Love Over Death really opened my eyes to what was happening to the people in Argentina. It was shocking to read the stories of what happened to these people. I cannot even begin to imagine the kind of pain the mothers went through when their children disappeared and there was absolutely nothing they could do. Matilde Mellibovsky did a wonderful job of portraying the hurt, despair, and helplessness of the mothers as they did everything they could think of to find their disappeared children. I think this a great book that really touched me. However, some of the stories did seem a little repetitive."
4,Circle of Love Over Death,"""Our children were not taken as prisoners from a battlefield; totally defenseless, they were abducted from their homes, from the street, from their places of study and work. Our struggle has taken years of ceaseless searching and every other possible method, but it has been carried out by legal, constitutional, non-violent methods-with a clean face.""Circle of Love Over Death gives you a first hand testimony into the horrors and ugliness that Argentina battled through for many years. Through the eyes of each of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, you find an emotional and physical struggle to find the answers that they were never given, where their children are. This book touches on every human emotion possible and really gives you a true understanding of how one political force can take out an entire country."

3,Get what you pay for,"Let me start with the good things about the CHD500:1) Price!! (beats the crap out of other HD drive based products)2) Great for backing up stuff from u'r stuff and laptop with its large memory3) Sound is good (when it does play) and the line out feature is coolNow the bad things:1) It freezes often2) Baterry life sucks. I can barely get 1 hour after charging for 10 hours. (This might be a problem with just my player because I have read some good comments about the battery)3) Navigation is way too complicated. Cannot create playlists on the go, cannot play songs at random, cannot browse for other songs when a song is playing4) Takes a long time to load a new songBottom line: If I could turn back time, I will pay the extra $100 and go for an Ipod.Also I've heard good things about the CHD1000."
1,This Sucks,This product is total crap.. It messed up almost immediatly after I got it the buttons fell in and the screen blurred.. Don't buy it!
3,Excellent price for storage,"But as everyone else has stated...you get what you pay for. When it is working it is a wonderful player for the price. But it rarely works right. I haven't had the same problems as everybody else stated (battery life, long indexing time, cutting off for no reason), mine will be playing a song and in the middle of it start up from the middle of another song. The title won't change on the display, just the song being played. It will do it a few times and turn the song into a 15 minute remix of all the songs I have on the player. I like remixes, but this is out of control!! I have tried downloading the firmware to see if that fixes it...but no luck. I reccommend forking out a little extra cash and getting a better player. Too much hassle with this one."
1,Don't wast your money,"This unit was installed in our new house and many others in our subdivision, and there have been many many problems with this unit. Our CD player quit working,(our unit is 3.5 years old), our neighbors door bell unit quit working and there are a host of other problems with other neighbors units. We can not get the unit fixed locally so hopefully the internet will provide repair help. These units are not cheap and its durability is ZIP!!! My advice Find another unit that gives you durability and value."
5,"$114, preposterous!","For those of you that want this charger and dont want to pay $114 for it. Heres a tip...the Energizer PS3 charger is the EXACT same charger for less than $30!!!! Check it out, it is the exact same one, I have it and it is the coolest and easiest charging solution available!"
5,Great Charger!,I didn't buy this charger from Amazon.com because I was able to find it used locally. It is a great charger and looks much better than some other chargers I was looking at. It is very nice that you are able to charge 4 controllers with the 2 additional usb ports and it charges the controllers very quickly. I highly recommend this product.
5,Fun looking Charging station,My husband asked for this for Christmas. I liked it because it was stylish so it wouldn't look akward sitting out. It lights up when you have the controller docked. Great purchase!
4,Handy,"I've had this charging station for almost a year and it still works pretty well. The remotes are charged fairly quickly. Also, it's easy to tell when each remote is charged as the clear plastic on the charging station turns from red to green for each remote. It's also nice not to have to use USB cables to charge each remote on the PS3.The only downside is that the charging station will alway remain on unless it's unplugged. It'd be nice if there was a power on/off button."
4,PS3 Charging Station,"Although definitely not a game, I have found this to be a pretty cool product. It helps alleviate some of the clutter in the area where I have my PS3 setup. I have 4 controllers so that I can play multi-player games with my kids, friends and other family members. The Charging Station allows me to stack two of them in vertical style in no more space than a regular controller, but I can also connect another UBS cable so I can charge another controller as well. That way I can continue to rotate controllers when I play single player games."
3,Had 2,Initially I thought this product was awesome. It's as aesthetically pleasing as it is functional.The problem lies in the fact that after about 2 months the product dies.When my first one died I thought maybe it was a faulty one and picked up another one. This one last 3 months and then it died as well.I tried it in different outlet through my house with other controllers my friends would bring over but it simply would no longer work.It's a quick fix at best but don't expect any longevity out of it.
5,PS3 Charge Station,"PS3 Charge StationThis is a nice looking charger, that works very well. It cleaned up the USB wires I had to deal with hanging out of my Entertainment Center.You will have to get the hang of inserting the controller in the charger but after a few times it becomes easy. The charger has a soft red glow while charging and the glow turns green when the charge is complete. There are two ports in the side that you can use for USB cords to charge two additional controllers."
4,The Miracle Diet,"I used this diet for 3 months and was able to take off the weight but beings that I am also a meat eater, I was tired of eating vegetables. Plus I have a hard time sticking to anything that requires a long term commitment (except for school and my husband of course. wink, wink)So, if you love vegetables and are very committed to losing weight, this book is for you.Actually I have the book right beside me, I'm ready to give it another try."
2,Read once and then never picked up again,"A friend of mine is now at retirement age, but she is hesitant to retire because she doesn't know what she wants to do with herself when she stops working. To give her some ideas, I bought this book despite the criticism by a number of the other reviewers. My logic was that reading short blurbs about what others were doing with their retirement might give my friend some ideas.My friend read through some of this book and then never picked it up again. She found it boring and lacking in the insight that I had hoped it would deliver. However, my friend really likedHow to Retire Happy: The 12 Most Important Decisions You Must Make Before You Retireby Stan Hinden. No, the Hinden book didn't give her any new ideas about what to do with herself, but it did help her to plan for the day that she does retire. If you are choosing between the books, based on my experience, I would recommend the Hinden book."
2,Random quotes,"The problem with publishing a book of mostly quotes from others is that you must tie them together somehow. You need to make some attempt at finding meaning or purpose in these quotes. Consequently, this book comes across as empty and without direction. If you're looking for advice or a good factual read, this is not it."
4,Fun book,This is a fun book to read...would have been a little more interesting read with information placed amongst the testimonies but I enjoyed the book.
2,A little bit disappointing,"The book is basically a series of short paragraphs written by many ordinary people describing how they had handled retirement or giving their advice. The advice was very basic, and seemed a bit random. I was hoping for new ideas on ways to fill the time, but this approach did little to fulfill that need."
3,"Leibowitz, not Maimonides","The problem with this book is that it is an exposition of the provocative and important world view of the late Yeshayahu Leibowitz, but falls short as a comprehensive interpretaion of Maimonides. The readings of Maimonides are (at best) controversial, do not add up to a systematic analysis of Maimonidean thought. Leibowitz gives no hint of how his interpretation fits into the large body of Maimonidean studies, and the book can not therefore serve as an introduction to the thought of the greatest Jewish thinker ever."
2,It gave me insomnia,"I started taking this because I was diagnosed with high cholesterol and could not take statin medications because they gave me insomnia. As it turns out, this product produced the same result, even if I took it in the morning instead of evening. I guess it was worth a try, but I do not take it anymore. Maybe others will have more success with this."
5,Gillian is my Goddess,"My Goddess. It is true that you must be mine now. Gillian is just too @#$%ing cool. Chemical Brothers? Oh my God. Are destinies are intertwined. Professor Milius says ""roll the dice!"" This CD has to be worth the price for her track alone."
4,No problems to report,"Unlike some other customers, I had no problems with this product. The product I received exactly matches the photo, and the dosage, etc. is all the same. Just like a regular order.The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I can't give definitive proof that this product will help your health and fitness goals. Like many other vitamins and supplements, there's a bit of faith at work. Especially when taking multiple pills every day, I can't say for certain this product ""works"", but I feel good so I'm going to continue taking the advice to scientists and doctors who have done the experiments."
5,Yum,If you're a fan of Sugar Blossom by Fresh you will love Archipelago's Brown Sugar and Vanilla line. It is a perfect companion.
5,Stiil in Love,"My cat still loves his little cow toy, it has a little bell, it's almost been a year and he still runs around with it like crazy!"
4,A Generational Thing,"I am of the generation that understands the cartoon in this book that features ""who's on first"" between Jesus and ""Abbot Costello,"" so the notion of combining cartoons with scripture is somewhat problematic for me. And there's Jesus saying, ""Hurry up guys, I'm sinking here! Ha! Made you look!"" as he water skis behind a rowboat. And the ever-present tiny drawing of Eve with the caption ""I'm waiting for Peter to try!"" The colorful cartoons are a sharp contrast to the text on each facing page. And that may be the saving grace. We have cartoons to attract the current generation accompanied by well written historical background explaining the significance and motives of key characters and providing insight into Jesus' teachings with no ""dumbing down."" To those like me who may have doubts about this combination, I am pleased to say the drawings opposite reflections on the crucifixion and death of Jesus are appropriate and moving. No heckling Adam and Eve, no word balloons."
4,Very Interesting,I've read most of the Deb Ralston series and have really enjoyed them. They make you think. I like the way we can get into Deb's thoughts--even though she's sometimes wrong. The books are quite interesting and fun while you try to figure out who-done-it. I'm looking forward to the next one!
2,"God, Save Rhino","Just 4 days ago I saw Cheap Trick. They are still one of the best rock bands to ever perform. Ok, on this video their performance is quite good maybe excellent. The problem is with barely recognizable audio and 8mm or 1st generation consumer quality video it's really difficult to say. Is this sound recorded with one built-in cassete recorder microphone? The picture quality almost rates average when the pure white stage light shines on the band. I love this band. Please someone, release commercial qualtity video compilation or a professionally produced (35mm film/digital sound) product on this band."
3,love for the band doesn't help this DVD.,"One of my favorite bands, ever. Seeing Cheap Trick and AC/DC back to back in the late 70's may be one of the best concerts i ever attended. You just can't beat Southern Girls, Come On Come On, Surrender, Hello There, Heaven Tonight, California Girls, Auf Wiedersehen, etc. But, unfortunately, This DVD does not live up to the quality of the Live shows, nor the studio albums. Both the video and audio, simply put, are inferior. In Addition, most of the classic songs I just mentioned are not played on this CD. The set list could be better. But, I still recommend it, because its a glimpse of a great rock and roll band. Simple songs, yet superbly written and eloquently played by Robin, Rick, Tom, and Bun E."
3,Overpriced,"I read the book, but I would not recommend it. It was way too pricey for a soft covered book."
5,I was there,"The Spirit of Woodstock Festival was an incredible experience and this production relive all the memories I had, with all the beautiful people and musicians I met there. Every song I hear on the CD is like a flashback of this fantastic nights with Michel Montecrossa's Music.I recommend this CD to everyone who wanna get this great feeling of life."
4,Good for anyone dealing with relationship problems,It depends on your needs and what you want to accomplish in your life. There are many good concepts for healing in this book. Felt the author was a bit repetitious
2,A Bit Foolish,"It's a brief review, but in scanning through it, it seemed a bit like redefining forgivness and having a new orientation to the concept. Didn't seem to help me much get over it, unless I accepted the new definition at face value, then it seemed I already was there, so no need to continue on. Maybe i'll have a more thorough look, but i doubt it, any time soon. Or, maybe i should consider some serious therapy, but this isn't doing it. Seems a bit foolish and self-trickery to get into the mindset where you convolute the reality to get to the other side. I guess it's a bit of a stretch for me."
1,What a Dumb Book,"This is the most ridiculous, stupid, dumb, overdone, silly book I have ever read. To have blind forgiveness in the face of hard realities is just stupid. In this book everything is forgivable--please don't insult my intelligence."
5,Forgiveness,"If you can't seem to forgive someone GET THIS BOOK. Forgiveness doesn't let them off the hook, we let ourself off the hook. They're not beating me up I am, I think I'll stop!!!!Jim G, Tonasket, WA"
5,awesome! must read,I have referred this book to many friends. Highly recommend for those struggling with forgiveness. This is a must read.
4,Shows the way to achieving happiness and peace of mind,"I thought that I was a forgiving person, just a troubled and unhappy one. After reading Dr. Luskin's book, recommended to my by my psychiatrist, my eyes were opened to the tremendous amount of space I was renting in my mind to the past and the grievances I had accumulated, especially those against myself.Learning to let them go with Dr. Luskin's suggestions based on scientific research cleared the space for me to more wisely deal with the issues underlying the grievances. I feel I moved from adolescenct angst into adulthood...finally."
5,Forgiveness,"Next to the Bible, this is the best book I have read regarding the necessity for forgiveness. The illustration regarding landing the planes that represent my unwillingness to forgive that have been circling around for years in the air space of my mind was especially helpful. I highly recommend this book!-W. Scott Moore, author ofDead Ends or Destiny?: Seven Paths through the Wilderness Experiences of Life"
1,No solution here!,"I was so excited to begin this book and I was faithful in reading everything even though I just wanted to get to the ""How to forgive"" part, and then I get there. What a CROCK!! Basically, this author is saying ""Just HOPE for the best because you can't control people, and you are making unenforceable rules, which is why you're so unhappy!"" I didn't even finish this book, and it's a good thing I didn't by it. I can't believe this so-called ""doctor"" thinks just HOPING that someone will do something the way you like it done will make you less disenchanted with everyone. This is B.S. I'm sorry, but that's not going to help me get rid of the horrible feeling of being cheated on, not by a long shot. I dumped this puppy back in the book return slot at the library. Good Riddance! Find another book for forgiveness, that's what I'm going to do!!"
2,50/50 Chance,I bought two of these. One of them worked and the other one didn't. I think that you would be better off buying locally then getting a product that might not survive the trip or was not working to begin with. The one that did work is fine. Amazon was great at the return process.
1,Burned out almost immediately,This light burned out in only a few weeks while being used in an outdoor motion sensor floodlight. It couldn't have been illuminated for more than a total of 90 minutes before burning out.
3,Bought two; one was D.O.A.,"Well, these flood lights are exactly what I needed, and at a fair price. Unfortunately only one of two that I bought worked. The other was DOA. Of course I was able to return it with prepaid shipping, but it's still a hassle and I was disappointed."
1,Lasted 1 second,Well I order 2 of these lights and I put them in and turned the power on. One of the two lights turned on for one second and then quit working. I have not called the company to see if they will correct the problem so for now I give this product 1 star considering you can get similar lights at lowes or home depot for cheaper. I thought this was going to be a better quality light. If I am shipped a new one for free I will see if that one works better and will update my review then.
3,TV vs CD,My daughter loves listening to Steve Songs on TV but not on CD. Even though same songs she prefers TV. Had to post this so no ones gets stuck with this CD.
5,Excellent novel,"Having lived in Venezuela for a few years in the 80's, I always wanted to read about their culture before it became so modern. The novel represents Venezuela, like a South American countries which have all come from a barbarous past to the present, which still shows segments of ""barbiere"". Maria Felix is Dona Barbara."
5,Works like a charm.,"I finally took my grandmother's old lamp apart and rebuilt it with this light kit. It was beyond simple and works great. I just didn't notice it was a push switch, so the three-way light is no longer an option. No big deal. The three-way option broke so long ago, I don't miss it."
2,Not impress,Very poor quality of this self production . It might have turn out better if done by a pro.
1,needed a pro,"This was, to put it mildly, a waste of money. The artist gave some glimpses of what he may be like as a performer, but definitely not enough. Also, the DVD looked as if it was filmed by a hand held video camera.Not enough concert footage. This was an opportunity to see what a Sir Charles concert would be like and that did not happen. The songs were cut short, half done, poor order, repetitive, shot at a poor angle, did not show showmanship, and overall look as if it was done by some little kid. Sir Charles music is good, but I think selling this was ill advised. Every time out the gate a performer should play like he/she wants to be a star or you will have an even shorter life time window to prove it. This looked like amateur night at a hole in the wall. I like his music and I have his greatest hits CD, but I am putting this DVD in my trash can!"
5,Excellent second disc,"What a great add-on to her first disc. Susannah has grown as a songwriter and singer, and some of these cuts aren't on national airplay due to the grossly unfair nature of commercial radio.""Colored Balloons"" is a starkly beautiful minor key prayer for all of us. ""The Line Between"" is for all of us children who grew old. ""Just One More"" should be an all time favorite break up song, and if you don't get a laugh out of ""The Real Vermont"" you've obviously never been there.This is a really great disc, and the instrumentals are a joy as well. Please put out another disc!"
4,Peterson's 4 Year Colleges 2001,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who is about to go to college. Instead of looking through the enormous amounts of college mail that gets sent to you, you can just look through this book and find which schools you think are best for you. This book contains detailed information about the majors, academic and recreational programs, abroad studies, application deadline, etc. It also contains tuition and room and board costs where applicable. This book is a great help in the college search--I would definitely recommend it to every college-to-be student!"
2,Wasn't feeling it,"I downloaded this album based on the Amazon's recommendation and the reviews. I wouldn't call this album straight-up wack, but it is kind of weak, especially if you're into soulfoul deep house. This guy has been compared to Miguel Migs, but the styles and sounds are totally different. In addition, it's an album not a mix."
5,"""In the Moment"" Kaskades beautifully!","I had the awesome privilege of getting to meet Ryan Raddon, AKA Kaskade--DJ/producer extraordinaire--at the Virgin Megastore in Salt Lake City, where he was spinning some original vinyl, signing autographed copies of his new album ""In the Moment."" (With an unassuming demeanor, Ryan's a pretty nice guy who happens to have Utah connections. Having pioneered the dynamic house scene in the state--and an ingrained player in the electronic-underground--he continues to produce quality material.) Upon listening to this fabulous CD, I was taken aback by the subtle complexities of the sonic architecture: Along with the stunning vocals and the organically soothing instrumentation, and the impeccable sound-layering techniques employed by Ryan, et al, it's a great album to play at clubs and at parties. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes the sultry beats and stylistic overtones of Kaskade."
3,'Courage' is wonderful; the rest if forgettable,"That sums it up. I saw the movie, heard the version of 'Courage', couldn't believe it was Sarah Polly singing it, and had to have it. I expected little from the rest of the CD -- sountrack music dissociated from watching the film is typically a 'glass-half-empty' experience for me -- but I was hopeful that the other Polly-vocaled tunes might be listenable. They came off as lightweight to me. But I can listen to that version of 'Courage' over and over again.For me, this is one of those times where the one track is worth the price of the entire CD. I suggest you watch the movie (wonderful), and if the song is still swimming in your head weeks after you see it, then get this CD."
2,Language subtly pejorative,"This book was useful information-wise in visiting Bucuresti and Transylvania. However, I found the overall language of the book shallow and subtly pejorative and insulting to the local people of Romania, and I am surprised that Lonely Planet, a respected publisher of worldwide guides, has published this book as is. A big part of traveling is to show respect for the other culture and learn from it (especially spiritually). Obviously a guide also needs to be realistic and show the negative sides as well, but I disagree with the author's subtly suggested attitudes. I realize that there are two authors, I am only referring to the section I used, the one on Bucuresti and Transylvania.I want to stress that I am NOT Romanian. Suffice it to say that I showed the book to a very educated and well-traveled Romanian friend who was very unhappy with the first random sentence they saw.In conclusion, Romania is a great place that one should visit, but I wouldn't take this guide..."
2,Parts of this book are fiction----did the author even visit the place?,"I bought this book for my recent trip to Romania. I should have passed on it and used the internet--the information would have been more useful. I especially found the information on the area around Bania Mare to be not only wrong--but useless. Sadly, I based a large part of my trip on the book. I also found the information on Brasov to be insufficient and in some cases just plain bad. I will say that the section on Bucharest was well done."
2,'Mutations' - A Tribute To Alice Cooper (Underground) Various Artists,"To the average old school Alice Cooper fan,'Mutations' just may be somewhat of an insult.I mean,come on;industrial bands covering Cooper songs?There are some decent cuts here,like the surprisingly kick-ass sedated version of ""Cold Ethyl"" by Written In Ashes,""Hard Hearted Alice"" by Chris Connelly(sounds like a Jim Morrison wanna-be on meth)and ""Halo Of Flies"" by Parallax 1.For the most part,this eighteen track compilation is a bit hard to take.Unless you find it,for say $3.00 or less,you might want to just pass it up altogether.You might try one of the other Alice Cooper tribute releases out there,like 'Humanary Stew'(see my review).It's better."
5,Simple and necessary reminders,"Baldino writes with admirable precision about the things we must do to navigate the sometimes tepid, often tempestuous waters of love relationships. Many of her points appear so simple and intuitive that we don't realize we've forgotten them, and that's what's most important about the work. For anyone who wants to maintain or salvage a healthy relationship, or for folks who feel their love is unreplenishable, this is your book. Baldino is smart, demanding, and right on in her approach."
4,Inspiration of a Classic,"I have been listening to Stryper since I heard ""FREE"" on the radio. They have a been such an inspiration. It is awesome to have one of my favorite bands, Guardian, cover one of my ultimate favorite bands. I love their rendition. I just wish that Guardian didnt break up. Keep the fire burning!!!!"
1,Shipped completely wrong product,"I researched for better lamp sockets and decided on Westinghouse over Leviton. What I wanted was a 3-way socket for light fixtures that have 3 different light outputs. The product is labeled as ""3-Way"" but what they sent me instead was 3-Wire lamp sockets. They are an entirely different product that is meant to be used with multiple light bulbs in parallel. Bad job of labeling! It's likely that the 3-way, not 3-wire, sockets are fine, but I have no way to get them through Amazon's listing because of this lack of understanding of the product."
3,Not quite right,"It fits quite awkwardly. The seam around the top of the dress is ultra-tight while the area that ""covers"" your breasts are a bit too large. I am a size 2-4, wear a 34B so naturally I bought a small but it was too small around but the bra part of it is too big. The stripes are really slimming though, and if you aren't planning on wearing it for long it works just fine. I would recommend it to someone who has larger breasts for their body."
2,I wear a sm/med and the m/l was TOO small,runs WAY small! i ordered a size up and it was still too small for me. bust runs even smaller
2,Belgian Euro low-techno,"I have six CDs of other performers covering the Ramones, not counting ones by former Ramones. And there's another in the works from Rob Zombie and friends. That's a tribute to the Ramones' song writing.This CD is not bad. The fairly low rating is simply because the performers are not the Ramones. You should get all the Ramones' classic records before buying any covering performances like these. Start with their first four albums, reissued by Rhino. ""Too Tough to Die"" and ""Mondo Bizarro"" are also very good.Of the 22 songs on this disk, 13 are from Belgium. I think the original recording company was Belgian, that's why. As the liner notes indicate, the favored style is something called ""lo-fi,"" apparently sort of a style of Euro techno with remixing and other studio alterations of sound. It's not particularly daring but sounds OK."
3,Great pants; not a lot of size options,"If you're looking for a pair of pants that are roomy in the thigh area, you may have found what you're looking for. The drawback to these pants is twofold and related. These pants have a very long rise (the distance from the bottom of the crotch to the waistband), so you need to drop your inseam by 2-inches if you'd like to have these ride at your hips, rather than your waist. Problem is, there aren't a lot of options for the inseam at all waist sizes. In my case, I need a 42 x 30, and they don't make 'em. The 42s are shortest with a 32"" inseam, which means a trip to the tailor to make 'em fit right."
5,Et Folkesagn / A Folk Tale (Complete Ballet),Et Folkesagn / A Folk Tale (Complete Ballet) is a 1991 cpo recording featuring the combined work of J.P.E Hartmann and Niels W. Gade. Petter Willemoes has written the music notes. Being a huge fan of ballet music I must say that I found this recording to be quite enthralling. Very light and quite accessible and enjoyable for both the novice of classical music as well as the connoisseur. Highly recommended. 5/5.
4,Brides from the past,"This book is definitely very useful for brides who want their dress inspired by the past. There's also a very curious part about star signs for brides-to-be who want to have fun. However, if your mantra is ""modern"", I don't think this book is appropriate."
2,Misleading Description - You Only Get One,"Notice the description says ""Fuses"", plural with an ""S"" on the end. Well. you only get one.Most other vendors sell these clearly listed as a two pack for less money."
3,Well...........,"Well it's much smaller then I expected, it's cute but small. The bottom drawer sticks to the black fabric like substance and won't shut easy until you close the whole unit and ""lock it"" the keys don't work. This was a birthday present, didn't know about this till it was opened and I can't really take it back now that it has been given. But it is cute."
4,I like this one a lot.......,"I'd only heard of DJ Disciple once on the radio before I saw this compilation, and it was enough to make this a instant buy..... Very nice work is done here (if you like classic east coast house). A very pleasant listen....."
4,These were exactly what I had expected.,"These knobs look great, are durable, and stylish. We updated our whole house with this product and are very pleased."
3,"Look nice, Installing them was not","I replaced some old knobs with these. I don't know who made the holes in my existing doors, but a couple of them weren't large enough to accomodate the inner part of the door knob. I've had some Weiser door knobs that didn't have this issue, so if you are replacing in an existing door, you might need a 2"" hole saw. Also, the striker plate seems to be a smidgeon larger.I wished I'd paid a little more for knobs that had a cover didn't show the screws."
4,Good for the first 15 minutes....,"I gave this cd 4 stars just because I adore Gabriel's Oboe; it's the reason I bought the cd, as we used it for our wedding processional. But past the Ave Maria, I can't really enjoy listening to it; a little too dark and dischordant to hear without the accompanying film."
3,"If you saw the movie or do not need music material for a performance, forget it.","Don't get me wrong, I love Ennio's work. The problem is that ALL OF THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME. They are a variation of 2 different melodies."
5,Always prompt and superior service,The best! I have ordered many times from this vendor and the results have been nothing but superior. Would continue to order from this vendor with great confidence of receiving on time and in great condition.
2,Not the Best Soundtrack in the World !!!!,"If your Looking for that Try The Soundtracks of the Legendary VANGELIS !!! Morricone Works a tiny bit of magic here but Soon lapses into repetitive motif's that wear on the listener to try and Stay Awake,lol....Ciao"
4,Beautiful soundtrack as evocative as the movie,"Anyone who has seen and loved ""The Mission"" will want to get the soundtrack to relive the feeling of the film. Gorgeous, insistent instrumentals and sweetly plaintive vocals recall the hope, joy, terror and deep sadness of the Jesuit missionaries on tragic, misguided missions among the doomed South American Indians. The music combines elements of classical with Catholic hymns and chants and native South American rhythms. Inspirational and sad."
5,The BEST soundtrack I have heard to date!,I wish more film composers would listen to this music to learn how to write a melodic line. I am tired of soundtracks that simply try to make musical effect. The recurring theme is simply the most haunting melody any film has produced!
5,Evocative and moody as well as uplifting,"This music embodies the spirituality and fear that course through the movie's themes. The use of the oboe and the strings is perfectly melded, and the repetition of the haunting melody is simply exquisite. I listen to this CD at the office and in the car, and it settles me down, calms me. It's a must for any lover of original comtemporary music."
1,wooden tulips and cuban cigars write,this dvd i bought because of the presence and participation of Bonnie Raitt. Well she appears in the end of the show for a few seconds but no musical contribution from her. the quality of the pictures is very poor and is's a shame to sell a movie of that kind. my conclusion; worst buy of the year
1,"Thumbs Down for ""Havana""","In brief, we ordered this expecting to see performances by the musicians listed in the description -- Glades Knight appeared for about 2-seconds, and many others mentioned didn't appear at all. This is NOT a performance DVD ... It's more of a documentary. I enjoyed passages of the presentation, but not enough to recommend it to you."
2,amazon error,"this amazon entry is messed up. this ""Cicero: Murder at Larinum"" has nothing to do with Cicero's famous treatise: ""De Senectute"" (On Old Age), but that is what the product description tells us. this volume contains selections from ""Pro Cluentio""."
4,This CD is one to get,"WoW. If you like any audio karate songs, then get this CD. It has great guitar riffs and the solos are nicely put together. Definately get this CD if you enjoy any of their songs."
2,A review from a non-friend,"I'm guessing that the previous reviews come from friends of the band, especially since they're from the Los Angeles area. So I think I should write a more honest review. Audio Karate is just ""another faceless punk band"". Although the word ""punk"" should be replaced by ""pop"" since the only thing punk about these guys are the crappy drum beats. If you think New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan are punk, well then you'll love this PUNK band. This band gives the title of ""label w/ crappiest mall punk bands"" to Kung Fu instead of Epitaph. Sorry Joe."
3,Decent debut by a (now) great band.,"Unlike the rest of the reviews on here, I don't think these guys sound ANYTHING like Simple Plan. In fact, I would consider it an insult if anyone compared my band to Simple Plan, and I'm sure Audio Karate feels the same. This is a solid debut record, but it's nothing great. Just good pop-punk with harsher vocals. Pick up their last record ""Lady Melody"" instead if you're getting into AK, it slays. ""Jesus is Alive and Well..."" is one of the best punk songs I've ever heard."
3,Audio Karate,"Good 90's pop punk. If you're a fan of old school Blink 182, Ataris and NFG give this album a go."
4,Not much new!,"OK, there is some new information here. Mostly it seems that Hayes has helped illustrate the travels of Mackenzie, something that was not available previously. Barry Gough's book is notoriously lacking in any illustration of Mackenzie's voyages and Mackenzie's own book is virtually without useful illustration. Maybe having read the previous two books makes me jaded but Mackenzie's voyages can only be retold so many times.Hayes has presented us with a slightly new take on telling the story with pictures, maps and historical vignettes but I hunger for a more thorough job. Perhaps more in the nature of Moulton's ""Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition"". Finding someone willing to wade through Mackenzie's rather impenetrable prose may be a challenge.Notwithstanding the above this is probably the best explanation of Mackenzie's voyages since the original journals."
3,First Crossing,"This book is a welcome collection of facts about the stupendous exploits of Alexander Mackenzie's Canadian exploration. But the words are curiously bleak & dispassionate, and separate panels of information on the pages, intrude into the flow of the narrative.What is needed now is for someone to take on the story, light it up with the raw romance of the period, paint the picture of the landscape, add colour photos of the places in the text, tell us about the man, and keep the size of the book down to normal.Let us see the landscapes in all their glory.The raw detailed story of the man remains to be told."
1,Not Compatible with Windows XP and Tech Support Warning,"I bought the original Myst and loved it so I thought I would upgrade to the newer version. It doesn't list Windows XP of course, but I thought I would give it a try. It uses an older version of DirectX and Quicktime, and it appears that the Quicktime is the culprit. I tried getting support on the web, but it was not to be found. No patches either. I would recommend skipping this if you have Windows 2000 or XP. Riven works ok on these platforms with a patch, and the new MystIII works excellent as well."
1,Warning!!! Do Not Buy This Buggy/Crashing Stupid Game,"If a point and click slide show that crashes your computer every 5 mins is your definition of fun then this game is for you. Also Riven does not appear to run on XP at all. Waste of money, time and software. Eating chalk is more fun than this"
3,"Entertaining, visually splendid, remarkably frustrating","Playing Myst reminded me of the episode in""Red Dwarf"" (British sci-fi comedy series)in which the crew discovers that they're actuallyordinary people who have been playing a virtualreality sim-game in which they play space travelers.The attendant is stunned to discover that they'vebeen playing the intro sequence the entire time.""But didn't you find the microdot that explainsthe secret mission?""""_What_ microdot?""""On the wall over Rimmer's bunk, the 'i' in hisswimming certificate! The dot over the i is a microdot.It's a dead giveaway, innit -Rimmer can't swim, and he's got a swimming certificate?""That's about as obscure as most of the puzzles, IMHO.Gorgeous to look at, wondrous to walk through, but ifit weren't for online tips and tricks, I'd never haveleft Myst Island."
2,This game is stupid!,"This game is stupid! The answers to the puzzles in it are really illogical. A two year old could sit there and try every combination possible until they solved it. The puzzles don't have any thinking involved at all. The answers to them are really illogical and I don't know how anyone could of worked them out. I don't mean because it is too hard, it is because the answers hardly even have to do with the puzzles themselves. It has no story. All it is is these stupid puzzles that a two year old could figure out. If you are thinking of buying this game, it is a complete waste of time!"
1,This is a game?,Wake up everyone! This isn't a game! It's a slide show! You could make something like this in PowerPoint on your own for crying out loud!
2,How could anyone like this?,This game is not very good. It is hardly fun at all. You shouldn't buy this. I know that it is so popular but I don't understand why. It is alright. It's not stupid. I was going to give it 1 star but it's alright. No where near 3 though.
4,how to run it in XP,"Been searching the internet and tried serval methods to get to run but to no avail it didn't work. Finally I came across a EASY solution on this site [...]. That site says it has something to do with QuickTime. Finally fixed it by (1) Installing the version of QuickTime that came with the software, and (2) going into the QuickTime ""Video Settings"" tab and deselecting the ""Enable DCI"" option.It works with QT 6.5, but I couldn't get it to work with the latest QT 7."
5,WOW DUDE its like cake to draw now.,Im a comic artist who is trying to break it in to the comic world. when i picked up this book i didnt know that drawing women in the comics was so simple and fun..ive been drawing for 14 years now and drawing women was the hardist thing for me to draw but now thanks to Christopher hart and amazon.com i can draw women like the pros.this is a must for anybody who whant to draw there best and try to get to a dream in comics this book is for you its worth the money thanks Chris.and Amazon.com
2,"All frosting, no cake.","Let's see. The title is 'How to Draw Great-Looking Comic Book Women'. The first chapter is titled 'The Basics', and about two pages are devoted to ""the basics"". The rest of the book seems to be Mr. Hart showing off his artwork. The title is very misleading; I have since found one or two other books that are much more helpful and accurate.Now don't get me wrong. Christopher Hart is a good artist and probably very successful in his field; but not much can be learned from a book that stays too much on the surface and never venturing down to the ""why?"" and ""how?"".I suggest this; find the book in your local bookstore. Flip through it. Flip through it again. Now put it back on the shelf. Congratulations, you have learned about all you probably will from this book."
1,Oh my! The anatomy is HORRIBLE!,"This book ""takes art to a whole new level?"" What?! The artist's understanding of human anatomy and correct proportion is ghastly. Torsos are weirdly lengthened or turned out-of-porportion to the rest of the body, chests are almost humorous, arms spout from upper bodies like mismatched attachments, and buttocks hang like onions in underpants. Faces are so generic they're interchangeable, except with variations on hairstyle. Apparently ""great looking comic book women"" are stereotypes that vary only in their decorative objectification: change the costume and the hair, and everything else is assembly-line rendered. Even the bare basics of human life drawing are absent in the book. The step-by-step processes aren't innovative, and are shown with MUCH better results in ""real"" art books. This is for guys who want to scratch out semi-bizarre ""babes"" and not realize how goofy the creations actually look. Sorry to be harsh, but MAN, this anatomy is poor."
3,not for beginners,"this book is an OK book, but it's not for beginners. the only thing this book does is give you ideas for what to draw not how to draw them. Christopher Hart shows some basics in the beginning but not enough for the first time artist. so if you are an experienced artist then this may be a good book for you but if you need a book on learning the basics, don't bother getting this one. and either way, you shouldn't buy this book brand new, buy it used instead, because it's not worth alot of money."
2,Save your money,"Think of all of the good books out on the market that you could buy! Flip through this book once or twice and you'll learn all there is to learn...from this book. There's so much out there about drawing women that this book just doesn't cover anything. Well it covers a lot of the same things his previous books cover, but that's about it. By the way, if you're going to learn to draw comics professionally, learn to draw comics from professionals, not from people that would do well to take a class on ""The Basics of Comic Book Artistry 101"" I will say, though, it's not all Christopher Hart's fault. Most of the schools across America are lacking in comic book art instruction. Still, If you don't know what you're doing, don't tell anyone else how to do it!"
2,Oh boy......,"Why do all comic book women look like silicon implant ads? I notice that although the blacement of bones, structure of the muscle groups, and other details may be important, it's difficult to see women as anything other than what's presented here. A whole range of body shapes should be explored, as well as something other than the ""spandex skintight"" that's presented for costume design with minor alterations."
1,a gooey mess,I was very disappointed with this purchase. The consistency is awful--sort of like honey or molasses. And it takes forever to absorb into your skin. Not recommended.
1,Not natural!,"I purchased this thinking it was an all-natural product. The only ingredient listed is Tocopheryl. However, I've discovered that its made from a synthetic form of Vitamin E. I will not be repurchasing this. The label should be clear and straightforward.I'd appreciate it if someone pointed me in the direction of natural vitamin e oil. Its better for you and more effective than the synthetic version. From what I can see all of the vitamin e oils listed on Amazon are synthetic.Natural vitamin e oil has the following ingredient. Natural = tocopheroltocopheryl= synthetic"
2,"cheap ingredients, fillers","i have noticed that jason has been changing their ingredients over the last couple of years in many of their products, particularly their e based creams. the 25,000 IU cream has been modified drastically and they have lost my business. i question their intentions? the ingredients are cheaper and more alcohol based with acids too that dries the skin!?!?"
4,Stealth inside,"It's maybe better, but however interested book for scale modellers and aviation amateurs(sorry my english)"
5,I thought this was a wonderful and moving soundtrack,The music was beautiful and really fit with the plot
5,"NYMAN SCORES OSCAR WITH GATTACA, BUT THE ACADEMY IGNORES IT.","When I saw ""Gattaca"" I fell in love with the music which is composed by Michael Nyman (The Piano, Carrington, Drowning By Numbers, etc.).Nyman structures the music to really feel in your soul about what you really want in life and how you have to sometime make sacrifices. The music hits you in the SOUL.This soundtrack never loses a beat throughout its entire spin. What baffles me that Nyman who has never won an oscar for scoring was totally ignored even for a nomination for this wonderful masterpiece (Gattaca)....a shame....but of course John Williams, and Bill Conti get nominated time after time for the same ole schtick.Other wonderful compositions by Nyman are also one of my favorits ""The Draughtmans Contract"", and ""Prosperos Books"".Nyman is a truly gifted composer who still has not got his due.A wonderful CD with beautiful composition."
4,Finally!,I finally found the threader I was looking for. It's not as well made as I remember from the past but stands up to my yarn.
3,It's ok,"It tends to tear my floss for cross stitching (where your pulling it through the needle) when i use this product. Therefore, I do not use it very often."
4,As Good As It Gets - SWING,"Already had As Good As It Gets - Rockabilly, and it was, so when I saw this one I decided it would be a good buy just like ""Rockabilly"" was. I was right. If you like the original big band hits, this might be just what you want. Recommend highly."
5,Supersonic Soul Pimps,"Bob & J.J. Miami, FloridaIf you are an imaginative person, and like unusual things, this CD is for you. It's a colorful and groovy new style of music. It's comical and zany. Your kids will love it and it's psychedelically excellent dance music. This is a really talented band, they are hilarious it's hard not to get up and dance to the funky, beat of the supersonic soul pimps music. They put the fun in funtastic! So get up and start groovin to their new CD Albino. So if you like to party and have a good time it's perfect for you."
5,Soul Pimps master funky rock,"I was turned on to this group by a friend, and once I saw them live, I had to have the CD. It is a little out there, but it is 100% original, creative, and entertaining! My best description would be Red Hot Chili Peppers meets Parliament, with a whole bunch of other stuff mixed in. You should really check it out!!!!!!!"
3,Okay Drill,"This drill worked really well for a while. I loved the extra battery and charger, the carrying case, and the driver bits that fit right in the top of the drill its self. The batteries were fairly easy to remove as well, which was nice. However, the batteries no longer hold a charge worth a darn and are always dead when I want to use them."
1,Absolute Rubbish!!,Do not waste your money on this. Unless you are drilling into your birthday cake this thing is pretty much useless. Broke two of the drill bits today trying to intstall window blinds.
2,Nice Except For Dreaded Chuck Wobble,"This drill has many nice features and is well-constructed for the price except for one caveat - chuck wobble. The wobbling chuck makes it nearly impossible to drill a hole true to size.I returned the first one ordered and while the second wobbles less, it nevertheless still wobbles. I may return this one, but I am wary of just getting another with the same problem or perhaps worse."
3,Gothic Trials,"THICKER THAN WATER by Madeleine Polland is a traditional Gothic suspense novel with a decided twist.Veronica MacKinnon is summoned to her father's family home to attend the death bed of his mother, her beloved Mama. It is a fair tale, but I kept wondering why if she loved the place so much she chose to stay away for 24 years. This aspect of the story didn't make sense. No matter what the attitude of her parents, why wouldn't she take her husband and two sons to visit a beloved grandmother? Or for that matter, for a large Irish family, why no one else showed up either to pay their respects.This put the story off kilter for me.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
1,Don't waste your time,"The money I wasted on this feature is ridiculous. The downloads are slow and spotty at best. I was always getting errors. Mind you, this is in New York City were the signal strength is excellent.Oh, remember everything is extra.Forget the whole thing.Buy a memory card and download from your computer, much cheaper and quicker."
4,a clever approach,"I like the approach used here: comments from hundreds of real people. It is a very clever way of getting insight into a condition--especially one that affects so much of the population. Most of the comments are very short, and appear to have been taken second-hand from other publications. What I found useful was the diversity of opinion, particularly when they came with detail of why they felt the way they did, or what sort of experience they had. Unfortunately, a lot of the ""advice"" was pointless or too short (e.g. ""I gained the freshman 25, not 15!""). In my opinion, the advice pieces should have been edited a bit more, and maybe some longer ones substituted for redundant shorter ones. That said, it is still better than 90% of the weight loss books out there, most of which are nonsense."
1,Eh... not what I was looking for,This book reads more like just a bunch of quotes from people who have lost weight. Not a lot of practical advice and actually less inspiring then I would've thought. I didn't get much from it.
1,This is more of the same,"I have read many diet books and been on many programs. For a person who has knowledge of dieting there is nothing new here. The people cited in this book have lost zero to over 100 pounds. The book consists of small paragraphs of advice from ""dieters""It has 12 chapters from ""Why lose weight"" to ""Good Stuff That Doesn't Fit Anywhere Else"" (in the book).Some ""wisdom"" in the book: Don't buy cookies and candy at the store so you aren't tempted at home. p72 Eat with chopsticks it slows you down. p174 Eat tons of popcorn and skip the butter. p92 No Krispy Kremes under any circumstances. p73.If you need pearls of wisdom such as these, buy the book."
2,Good for someone just starting out in life...,"This book is most appropriate for someone who has just entered the workforce. Many of the lessons regarding behavior in the professional world are useful, but not profound. I was dissapointed in the section of the book devoted to personal matters. In general, I would not recommend to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of basic personal financial skills."
4,Crashproof Your Life,"Good book, lot's of helpful hints, however, there are numerous references throughtout of his website ""crashproofyourlife.com"" that promise further information. Website can't be found."
2,Worst Star Trek Pilot to Date!,"""Emissary"" is kind of a bore. It starts out with some great action sequences with Federation vessels battling the Borg from the Star Trek: Next Generation episode ""The Best of Both Worlds"" where we get to see the death of Commander Sisko's wife, but then the story jumps to the present day and we get into the main plot, and - oh boy, does it get slow from there. The only other action was at the very very end when the station comes under attack by the Cardassians. But the battle only last for a very little while before it's over. There is hardly any action in it what so ever, and most of the story deals with our main characters' past demons. Way too much drama and not enough excitement. Pitty, because underneath it all there is a very good story trying to escape with some great characters in it. What a shame!"
4,"great photos, good print quality and basic info for kids",Although this book has only 28 pages it is an interesting book for kids about dolphins. The text is in large letter which makes it easier to read for children who want to read themselfs or grandmothers/grandfathers :) who might have to read it for them. Being a wildlife photographer myself I have to admit that the photos are very good and the quality of the print is of equal level. So even if you're not a kid any more and just like dolphins it's well worth the money. Of course this is not a comprehensive book on dolphins but it was never meant to be.
2,Hunt for a better book,"This one really drags. The characters are all stereotypes moving through a milieu of Los Angeles street life that reads as if it were lifted straight from movies about Los Angeles street life. All of this could be forgiven if it moved quickly and was done with style. However, there was too much uninteresting characterization and hardly any action at all."
5,Iz,"Even though God called this great singer to be with him, He is still one of the greats Hawaiian singers of all time. This product was shipped on time and received in perfect condition. I will be ordering more music from this shipper and would recommend them to anyone..."
2,Hawaiin Music,Most of it is good because of this man's powerful voice and range. We bought the cd for Somewhere Over the Rainbow - a very different take on this great piece.
2,IZ is,"I was so excited to get a CD of IZ songs. I was heartbroken when the first CD arrived and the sound quality was terrible, every track was scratchy or inconsistent. Seller facilitated a speedy exchange and broke my heart again - the second CD sound quality was just as bad as the first one. I am keeping it, however, because with Amazon Prime I get all the songs in MP3 format on my Cloud Player. I can still listen to IZ on my computer at work or on my Kindle, which was the point of getting the CD in the first place."
3,It's okay.,"I bought the CD because I like the song ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" and I have found I like a couple other songs on the CD. Some of the songs I skip over when I listen to it."
1,Disappointed in Florida,"I have read many of DR Meredith's books and was really looking forward to her new series. However, I was extremely disappointed in this book. Not only did I not finish it, I didn't even read the last chapter to find out ""who did it"". I didn't care."
3,Sounds like a fan wrote her own mystery,"First off I really Like this Mystery. Of course I'm also a short red-hear reference librarian who has an academic background in Teutonic History. I really got the feeling that the author was a fan of mysteries and took it upon themselves to write a mystery about mysteries. I really liked the idea, I was just disappointed that the most obvious person did it. One other beef the victim. The author really did a good job creating a character that was so awful that readers would cheer when they died. My issue is that we didn't get enough background as to why the character was so mean and passive-aggressive.Otherwise for dialog, character relationships, and pace it's a really good start. I will enjoy seeing the protagionists develop."
2,Predictable and boring,"I was most excited that a mystery would be written about a book club and a reference librarian. However, after reading this book I was most disapointed. They story lumbered along and the plot was predictable. Of course the main character would be accused of the crime by the real killer. Not a real academic 'whodunnit'."
4,An enjoyable book to read!,"I enjoyed Murder in Volume. Being a female scientist who grew up in the Texas Panhandle, I felt a connection to the main character. Although it is relatively easy to deduct the murderer, the motive is what I found to be both interesting and unique. I am looking forward to further issues of this series!"
3,Nothing more than a reference,"This book is a bunch of variations with a good quantity of complete games at the end. It is in fact well structured but explaines nothing so you have to figure out what's going on on the board! It contains infinitely more stuff than the Encyclopedia of Chess Opening, but on the learning level it's not sufficient for me."
2,Misleading product description,"Medi-Temp Universal Hot/Cold Therapy Pad, LargeThis pad is NOT LARGE. The product is three small pads stuck in an awkward three slot jacket.While it does the hot/cold therapy, it is more difficult to use than the single pad. Very misleading product description, no?"
5,Worked perfectly,worked perfectly with a chandelier that was given to me but did not have the canopy kit. Looks like it was made for it
4,Book Review,As a therapist I try to find ways of fine-tuning my craft. I feel this book will be helpful in aiding my clients in the healing process.
3,I Never Received the Book,"I ordered a book from this seller and almost 3 weeks later I still had not received the book. I was force to purchase another book because I needed the book for a class. The seller did eventually refund my money, but the damage had been done I feel. In the seller favor they did work with me to locate the missing book. It is for this reason I am giving them three stars instead of one star. Trust me when I say I was not a happy customer."
3,Stackola was better.,"Op.Stackola was better, this Cd Lunitik Muzik is missing that in my opinion. Where's Dru Down? They do a collabo with Too Short?(Who had beef w/Dru Down) That's messed up. At least E-40 AND B-LEGIT are on there. And 2 live Crew Sans Luke."
4,If you dis this CD you must smoke 20 bluntz a day (song 16),"This is actually 4.5 Stars. This CD is great. Should've gone platnum. There's only about 2 bad songs out of 16. Is it Kool (a parody of LL Cool J's WHO DO YOU lUV is the shit. Song # 1,2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14,15,16 are all great or good songs. A must buy"
3,Solid Professional Roundup of Obscure R&B For Completitsts,"It's a fine roundup of solid, professional 60's funky & soulful R&B.; There are no hidden or forgotten gems, just a solid roundup of regional artists who couldn't quite break out nationwide like Motown, Philly, Stax or Atlantic artists ...A nice CD for completists but for general R&B; fans, they will probably find this CD wanting.The sound quality is excellent."
5,Wonderful,"I think that Dr. Gray is the most amazing author. He not only capture the questions that are in my heart, he answers the ones I don't know how to ask! Wonderful collection!"
5,A new voice!,"I keep listening and listening and listening. My favorite new CD since Jonatha Brooke. A little jonatha, a lot joni, but uniquely maia. Great!"
2,This movie adaptation makes a great novel choppy and confusing,"I really enjoyed the novel ""Love in the Time of Cholera"", but like so many adaptations, this film version comes off as choppy and confusing. The movie is beautifully shot, full of exotic sets and beautiful people, but the wonderful story gets jumbled and lost in all of the majesty. I was fully confused by the end of this movie, even though I had read the book!"
2,2 thumbs down,"I thought I was going to get an epic romance that would jerk the tears from my ducts, but not one of my eyes was moist by the end of this film. Maybe if I had read the book first, this movie would be better. The story was just blah. I get the story (it's not hard to understand), but I didn't feel the emotion or sadness or love or happiness that the characters felt throughout the entirety of the movie. I felt it a little in the beginning, but by the end I was numb. I think all the sexcapades that Florentino had just took all the emotion out of it for me. Or maybe it was Giovanna Mezzogiorno's pale, mannequin-like face. I don't know. I'll admit that the ending was sort of sweet and almost makes you want to say, ""Aw, how sweet."" I was just not as moved as I had hoped I would be."
1,Disgusting......,The title to this movie should be Sex While Waiting. The movie is trying to make it seem like this is TRUE love! The woman picks her husband based on money and the man spends his WAITING years having sex with every woman except his mother! Disgusting film.....do not recommend to anyone!
2,Long and kinda boring,"This movie was too long and somewhat boring. It has charm and some beautiful secenes but as a whole the work is disappointing. I purchased the movie and watched it once and may never watch it again. The story is good, but it just dosent manifest well on the screen. I would recommend that you watch it but rent it first rather than buy. If you like it then you buy it. I am glad its in my collection, but I may not watch it anymore."
2,It's a little cheesey but isn't love always?,"The movie has a great story line but some of the acting is a little unbelievable. In a perfect world I would remake it, cast my own script,rewrite some of the lines, and add more drama. Enjoyable enough but not a movie I would want to see more than once a year."
1,"Trust me, you would rather have cholera than see this movie",I'm not kidding. Don't waste your time. This is the worst movie ever!
2,Not a 5 star movie. But very charming,"The trailer for this movie captivated me with expectations of a beautiful love story. Since, No Country for Old Men I have been intrigued by the mere presence of Javier Bardem. I reluctanly rented this movie because I hadn't heard or seen any reviews about it. But I decided to give it shot anyway. I have to admit the movie is not a feature film and had I taken the time to get dressed and go to the movies to see I would have probably been disappointed. The story had geat intentions and the actors did a great job but the story failed in a lot of areas. Suprisingly, it had very funny moments; plus the idea of someone waiting 50 years to love another is a beautiful thought. The movie is not 5 stars but it has it's own charm and it won me over and I want it for my video collection."
5,!!!!!,What can I say that has been written already been written. This is one book you just enjoy re-reading every few years. Oh so yummy.
4,Love in the Time of Cholera,I really liked this movie. Javiar Bardim is so unlike his role in No Counrty For Old Men. I just hate him for taking Penelope Cruz away from me.
3,a good movie,"After reading all the negative reviews on this movie, I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. I loved the novel, and now am a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's works. I was pleasantly suprised that the movie kept true to the novel, and very much pleased with the actors that brought the charaters in Marquez's book to life. The scenery is spectacular, and the cinematography is breathtaking. Its worth watching and judging for yourself, as Oscar Wilde once said...""One man's poetry is another man's posion""."
1,Love in the Time of Cholera,"This movie had fine, quality, actors starring in it but failed to deliver in storyline. The movie was weak and failed to create a character developement of the actors."
2,Yawn....,"From the previews I thought this film would be great. Of course, that's what all trailers do. They use the most riveting footage and present you a 40 second preview that looks amazing.I won't go into anymore details about what and why I didn't like this film as they are already covered in everyone else's low opinion of this film.One thing I'd like to add was that it felt like 4 hours went by while watching the film, when in fact, only 60 minutes had passed. So I wasn't even at the end of the film when I thought I had dwindled the whole evening away on this film."
4,A must see,"I am a big fan of Garcia-Marquez and I could not pass up the opportunity to see one of his novels on the big screen. It was passionate, funny, and just great to watch."
2,"Meaners, and Meanders...",This may have been a beloved novel in South America and I admit I did not read the book - which may even be better for the review for a movie needs to stand on its own and this one meanders... and meanders... and makes no point. And I didn't care about any of the characters. The heroine is boring - the two main guys are boring -and the movie is - boring. But...I'm glad I got it - movies arent' only to entertain - but to instruct - what not to do. I'm writing a novel.
2,The Book was Probably Better,"I haven't read the book, but I would guess that it is better than this movie. I like some of the actors in the movie, but I like them in other movies...not this one. The movie/acting could have been very moving and emotional. It was not. The story lends itself to be a great film, but I think the film did not do the story justice. The music was very good though. Shakira did a fantastic job."
2,Nothing without Javier Bardem,"I fell in love with the book over family vacation this summer. Devoured it in a matter of days. The movie - and its poor casting choices - doesn't compare to the poetry of the novel. In fact, had a viewer not read the book, I can imagine the movie being insufferable and incoherent. Bardem's performance was amazing despite the poor adaptation. The cinematography was beautiful."
1,"If you love the book, avoid this movie","Gabriel Garcia Marquez's works must be among the most difficult to adapt to a movie. The lyrical and mystical nature of his writing is practically impossible to show on screen.So when starting with disadvantages the director needs to be on his A-game. He lost it riight at the onset when he decided to make it in english. It would have been betteroff made in spanish. If it was made in english, why the stupid accent ? The book translation doesn't come with accents. Why in teh movie? Reminded of last year's disaster ""Memoirs of a Geisha"".In short, if you love the book , you will HATE the movie."
5,Love Love in the Time...,"I loved this movie when I rented it so I had to have it. Brand new condition, awsome price and came fairly quick. What's not to love?"
3,makes me want to finish reading the book,Great cinematography. I think there could've been better choices for the actors cast in the film; or maybe they could've put more into their roles.
5,Did'nt read the book,"I for one did'nt read the book,. I loved the movie so much that i can not stop watching it. I love what it is all about and Javier is now one of my favorit actors he is so passion in his work. and the music... I'm speechless."
3,Plenty of cheese but missing a wow factor,"2.5 stars. For years I've heard of the this wonderful book, but given the long list of books on my table I opted instead to watch the movie. BIG mistake. There are lines in this movie so corny I can't stop wincing at the screen. I never bond with the two main characters and never experience the longing I'm supposed to have for these two to finally come together. For some reason I don't think that it's the actor's fault. More the screenplay and the direction. Oh well, I guess there's always reading the book."
4,EL AMOR EN LOS TIEMPOS....,"AS A COLOMBIAN AND FAN OF GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ`S BOOKS I FOUND THIS FILM SADLY A MISREPRESENTACION FROM THE BEAUTY OF THE BOOK ITSELF.GREAT ACTORS BUT NO MUCH THEY COULD DO IF THE DIRECTOR CANNOT PUT THE BOOK FEELINGS INTO THE ACCION OF THE FILM.FEAR ENOUGH, YOU CANNOT ALL BLAME IT ON HIM, BECAUSE I DONT THINK ANYBODY EVER WOULD BE ABLE TO DO A FILM ABOUT HIS BOOKS AND GET IT RIGHT.BY THE WAY TO THOSE WHO ARE WRITTING ABOUT THE FILM WITHOUT READING THE BOOK I THINK IS JUST POINTLESS,READ THE BOOK FIRST THEN YOU CAN MAKE A FEAR COMMENT.ANYWAY THERE WERE FEW GOOD SCENES ON THE FILM, SPECIALLY SHOWING THE CARRIBEAN SPIRIT IN COLOMBIA,AND THE BEAUTY OF THE PICTURES.OVERALL IT CANNOT BE BETTER, AND BLAME THE EXCELLENT ABILITY OF GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ AS AUTHOR."
1,5 Reasons not to buy this product:,"1) ""Hangin' With Hung"" sounds like the sort of movie shot in a Turkish Bath house.2) William Hung has already been on every daily show, A.M. show, talk show, and show show America has. There is NOTHING new here.3) I have not completely dissuaded myself of the notion that laughing ""along"" with this DVD is not unlike laughing at a mentally retarded person.4) William has never possessed talent. He will never possess talent. If you purchase this item, years from now, you will rediscover it sitting in the closet (symbolism?) with your Tiny Tim and Dr. Demento albums. It is a fad, a poor fad, and unworthy of your money.5) It isn't funny. It isn't cool. No one outside of the fringe elements of the remote Canadian wilderness still thinks so. Drop it. Let the William Hung phenomenon die. Or are you still chuckling at the antics of Tom Green and the comedy stylings of Andrew Dice Clay as well?"
1,What a joke...,"...Seriously. And not a funny one. Everyone knows that watching William Hung is like looking at a bunch of baby birds that the mother bird kicked out of the nest. It is horribly gruesome but for some reason you just can't look away.I don't feel bad for any poor sap that actually paid money for this. Nobody should be reimbursed for buying this or any other William Hung product. In fact, all who buy this should be tracked down and have all their money involuntarily donated to charity. Just the fact that people would spend money on things like this is proof that some people do not need/should not be allowed to posses money.Where is Yoko when you need her???"
1,HAVEN'T WE SUFFERED ENOUGH??,"Ohmigawd, I'm still reeling from ""Inspiration"" and ""Hung for the Holidays"" and now he's made it to DVD. Can things get any worse?Ever hear a Siamese cat howling in heat? My cat Tasha is going through one, and her caterwauling sounds like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir compared to Hung's singing. Better yet, Tasha has vocal depth, amazingly perfect pitch, hits the high notes, and attracts every tomcat in the neighborhood. This DVD featuring the no-tone Hung will cause even the most ardent tomcat to lose interest. It offers nothing, is of no redeeming social value, and is a total waste of money.I don't feel sorry for William Hung--he is laughing all the way to the bank. He allows himself to be exploited for the sake of the Almighty Dollar.I do feel sorry for the fools who buy this DVD."
1,disgust,this and all william hung products disgust me. Who in there right mind would buy this? Even as a joke but come on thats what kings of comedy is for. God help us all
1,False Information,"This cut is NOT remastered; it looks to be taken from a bad VHS and transferred.I have been waiting years for a good copy and from what I've been told only a DVD from France would be pristine and taken from an original 35mm print but since this is a different region I wouldn""t be able to play it.DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED."
1,Hercules remastered,Got this movie hoping it would be like the european cut which is a clean master transfer but not viewable in the US because it's a region 2. Instead I get garbage. A dvd with a transfer which looks like it was made in someone's basement. The worst transfer of this movie I have ever seen. Don't even bother ordering it.
2,buy a honda powered general,"This is quite possibly the worsdt 500 dollars iv ever spent ( if you include the auger bit and 12"" extension. Within two days the throttle handle broke and i rigged up a metal coaqt hanger that worked fine then three days later the gas tank cracked replacement cost on that is $43 for a piece of plastic junk it really doesnt have much power at all if you hit much mor than a three inch by three inch rock you better have diggin bar handy and the worse part are hte ayugers they are very poorly constructed and held together with grade five 3/8"" hardwar i over bored all the hole and went to grade 8 1/2"" and they dint break every time i hit abig rock but im sur it voided my warranty on my 130 dollar bit. so if you plan on using for one job rent a general or if your gonna use daily consider a hydraulic model there about $1500 more but will pay for them selve in power and performance this is pure junk"
4,The book is very mysterious.,"I like Skeletons Don't Play Tubas because whenever Liza gets really scared her nose bleeds. The kids think that Mr.Belgrave teaches a skeleton how to play the tuba. My favorite character is Eddie because he always gets in trouble.I recommend this book for grades 1, 2, and 3 because it is a fun book to read and it is very funny."
5,Skeletons Don't Play Tubas,"When the four kids meet their band class teacher. They think he is an evil skeleton. The kids must save the school before the evil skeleton attacks. You Know what Mr. Belgrave's skeleton is?. It's name is Claude. They are also surprised to see their band teacher carrying a big box over the cemetery. Liza got scared because Claude almost tapped her foot. Is this for real?While Book 10[Witches Don't Do Backflips] was their new gym coach. Liza, Melody, Howie and Eddie were glad. But one thinks the new coach is a witch because she says weird languages and like a spell. I Also like Zombies Don't Play Soccer because the new coach is Coach Graves. Suddenly, An old lady appears and she says that if she[Coach Graves] will not go she will turn her into a zombie. But Coach Graves disagreed so she turned her a zombie. Now that the coach is a zombie she cannot help the Team of the four kids. But when the game started something surprising really happened. But you must find out."
4,As Good As it Gets: Boogie Woogie (Import},"Good album. Reproduction clean. Excellent choices. However, a greater variety of styles would be appeciated. Somewhat monotonous as is."
2,USB connection did not work. Clunky user interface. So-so quality.,"When I got this frame, the USB connection to the PC did not work and I returned it for a refund.The quality of the frame was so-so: the holes in the frame were not properly lined up with the electronics behind them and I had to ""force"" the SD card to get it to go in.I agree with one of the other reviewers that the user interface is just horrible: as far as I can tell, you *must* use the remote to access most functions (don't ever loose it!) and in general things just seem much more complex than they need to be. If you are used to apple user interfaces, this will feel like the stone age.Also, I somehow got the impression from the reviews that the image quality was excellent. I thought it was nothing to write home about, but then again, this was my first digital photo frame and maybe everyone else is even worse."
1,Horrible do not buy.,"Well I was really excited to get a digital frame. Really looked into which one would be best for a Mac and this one looked good. The first one worked for ONE day. Amazon is the best, and replaced it right away, with another which worked for about an hour. Oh, and when I called the company's support line the first time, they told me it could be a faulty electric adapter, so if we had another one at home to try it. Well that didn't work. So I didn't even bother to call them the second time. I wish the real world would get with it and join the Mac world."
4,nice case,for the money it's a really nice case with good protection and padding and felt lining. my fender telecaster bass fits perfectly
3,Don't understand the raves,"The five star reviews of Shadow Fields elude me. I found the book's concept and its execution pedestrian: year-by-year account of smart young man's life that leads inexorably to the top of a heap and a realization that the heap is--just a heap. The main character isn't really developed, and the people surrounding him flit into and out of the novel just so he has some company. We don't get to know them; they remain cartoons."
5,Mustela is just the best,"This product does not irritate my daughter's eyes or her sensitive skin. It foams well (but not overly so) and it rinses clean easily. It's lovely on her full head of hair, too. I've used it since birth and now use all of their products. Light scent - just enough to smell cuddly clean."
5,"Great Seller, Great Price","I love this CD. Great memories connections to the movie and others of my own now that I've been listening to it. It is a slick ecclectic mix of off artists compiled into a fabulous mix. Great driving music, background tunes, or working out with your ipod.Also, this seller sent the product swiftly, and at an affordable price.I would most certainly purchase from them again as the occaision arises."
5,Incredible!,"I listened to the previous ""Ocean's"" music. This is absolutely a bomb. It really flips. It includes all the elements in this CD, including jazz, techno and flick. I really like this CD and I never regret to listen this over and over again. My personal favorite will be track 1, 2 and 13."
5,Five-star album..,"I have been listening to this album constantly since it came out (and I might mention Lou is one of the few artists whose new album I simply had to purchase as soon as it was released), and I can't find a bad song on here. Not only is this a five-star album, it is a collection of twelve five-star songs, in my opinion."
5,The BEST of Lou. Without a doubt...,"Here is a CD that will reach a wide audience - those who like soundtrack music, those who like classical style, those who enjoy what is known as 'new age' music, and the list goes on.This is definitely the best of Lou and if you are not acquainted with Lou, this is probably the CD where you would want to start. The music is versatile. In places the music is simple, in others intricate, but always enjoyable and pleasant to hear. His music is well worth the investment."
5,Yanni,"I saw Yanni play the music on the CD in concert in Sacramento. Reliving it by hearing it again feels great. I think of all the CDs I heard of his, this is the best."
1,you'll laugh,"This man is just hallarious with all his mystical music and his long, flowing mane! give me a break, this isn't music! Buy the classics instead."
3,Pretty Good,"I am not a regular fan of Yanni; my tastes usually skew toward R&B. However, I was browsing at a local Borders and heard the song ""Nightingale"" on a compilation CD, ""Pure Moods"" I think. I felt that that song was absolutely beautiful, so I searched for the CD with that song on it and found ""Tribute"". I found the rest of the CD to be satisfactory, so I purchased it. I find ths album to be great when my mood calls for a soaring orchestral performance. Being a fan of gospel and R&B, I must say that I was unimpressed by the couple of tracks that featured vocal performances, but the instrumental tracks were well done. Having now listened to this CD repeatedly, my opinion is that the highlight of this CD is ""Nightingale"" with everything else being attractive aural garnish. Not bad on your plate, but eat something else with it."
3,Tribute,This is by far his greatest performance yet. He just keeps getting better and better. I listen to this over and over and never get tired of it.
2,Help!,"Help! Aaaaaah! Attack of the killer opera ladies! Yanni could have used some serious help with this album. The only songs worth listening to are Deliverance and Nightingale. Other than that, this album is nothing more than an attempt by Yanni to try to find even more tone-deaf idiot fans. The ladies in the background grunting and trying to sing, along with the song Love is All and the song Niki Nana, did not help the album."
1,Disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, I love Yanni and have many of his CD's. I purchased this and rushed home to listen to it. Well, I couldn't get half way through it. It screeched!! The violins screeched, the voices, the instruments, (all but the piano), they all screeched. Luckily I was able to get a refund because it was less than 24 hours since I bought it. Unless you like screeching, don't waste your money."
1,Naive and empty. Skip it.,"I bought it after I read so many nice comments about the artist. What a disappointment! I don't understand what is so nice about this album. (...).(...)I can pick up any CD of Sting and it will be a much safer bet than getting the 'Best of' CD of Yanni. (...).In this part of the world, this is called commercial music, i.e. written for seducing easy fans and for making money. I know his fans will be offended. It's okay, you're entitled to having your opinion. But if only fans write comments, others will never know the truth."
5,Greatest composer since Tchaikovsky,a fantastic piece of work. I was privileged to see him in concert and he truly is gifted. Any album of his is extraordinary.
4,Great for Winning Over New Classical Listners!,Yanni's Tribute was s good medium for winning over more novice listners! I am beginning to enjoy and listen to only classical music now. I now go to concerts without a school group!
5,Fabulous,Thought the Acropolis CD was wonderful but this one is even better. Yanni is a genuis. It's haunting and beautiful.
5,~Beautiful music~,"I have always known ""of"" Yanni, but I truly got to hear his music on a PBS special and fell in love with his music. What a production and yet I haven't seen anything top it. I like all the detail put into the album with the violin and all the rare instruments. If you like Enya or Ryan Farish, you will love Yanni."
5,Powerful and beautiful,I've bought this CD many years ago and I keep listening to it over and over again. The music of Yanni is one of my favourites and I do not have only this CD but certainly this is MY favourite one. Do not miss it!
5,Tribute is one my fav,This CD to me is one of his best I love it I had to buy a new one as I wore out my first one.
4,Should Be Required Reading...for everyone!,"The concept behind this Conspiracy/Mystery earned the 4 star rating. It is a scary idea but considering the situation the West finds itself in, one we should consider.The writing leaves something to be desired. The continued replay of the linguistic\analytical prowess of Dr. Judith Miller wears thin after the twentieth replay. Quite frankly the plot and what I will call the foundation storytelling work well but the full novel reeks of a book plumped up to meet someone in the process' page count requirements.That said, it is a good read and at the Kindle pricing, well worth the $2.99 and the time. Read it you will enjoy it.Treachery In Turtle Bay (Anna and Hugh Masterson Mysteries)"
4,"A helpful tool for patients, families and healthcare profess","A thorough and sensitive story which depicts the life of a kidney patient. An extremely helpful tool for patients,family members and healthcare professionals with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of a life-threatening chronic illness. A must for professionals involved in all aspects of nephrological health."
1,NEVER!,"First off! You never use a lunge whip to ""change"" the horses behavior as said in the description. A lunge whip is used to lunge a horse. Lunging is when you are in a round pen or an arena and the horse can either have a lead on or you can free lunge(wihtout lead). the lunge whip is only there if you NEED it. you ""pop"" the lunge in the air but you never EVER hit the horse with it.This person seriously needs to revise their statement and think about what they are writing! And if this is how they use a lunge whip, i hope they get hit just as much as they hit their horse.Thank you."
5,AWESOME!!! HELPFUL!!,"This guide is very detailed and helpful. If you get stuck, it's a step by step walk through of what to do and how to do it. Just AWESOME - A++"
5,SPYRO ROCKS!,"Even though I've completed the game without the book, I stil bought it! It's a really good guide for people new to Spyro."
2,"OK, but made in China","I have had so many poor experiences with cheap products from China that I try hard to find things made in USA. In the past, the DeWalt name has generally been one I could depend on but now, it's beginning to mean ""made in China."" These nails are no exception. They are Chinese. They may be OK but I'm suspicious of the quality of the metal and plan to look elsewhere for future nail purchases."
4,Good Quality,I've used and re-ordered DeWalt nail products many times because of my experiences. They get the job done best for me.
4,ReDo!,"Okay, I do love this book. Between the stories from Ms. Kelly's personal experience, the good research into factual info, the insets of other people's experiences/testimony about rosary praying and just the tips on how to do and how to do better, this is a fine book on the subject. It also happens to be mostly Liz Kelly's ""Seeker's Guide to the Rosary with the addition of material on the Luminous Mysteries when I was expecting or at least hoping for a whole new book. (sigh) So, for those who already own Seeker's Guide but would enjoy reading about the Luminous Mysteries, you may wish to purchase this. For newbies, it's a delight. If Seeker's Guide to the Rosary is enough for you, well, give it a pass. (I hate giving old books new titles!)"
3,"Good, but not great retelling of DD's origin","This is an entertaining read but nowhere near as good as the ""best"" Daredevil stories ever written. Frank Miller's writing is characteristically tough and gritty -- he is to comics writing what Martin Scorcese is to movie directing. However, unlike Miller's earlier work on Daredevil, the story just doesn't flow as smoothly here. I got the feeling as though Miller was writing tough stories just for the purpose of being tough, whereas in Miller's more heralded work (on Daredevil and Batman) the gritty element contributed to an excellent and fluid storyline. Perhaps the biggest problem here is that Miller is judged by his own standard -- and this story, while good, is on the same level as the classics that he's cranked out before."
4,"""Man Without Fear"" worth reading...","Most comic readers ignore Daredevil as a character, and most non-comic fans have never even heard of him. More's the pity, then, that they miss this retelling of Daredevil's origins by Frank Miller. The story is gritty, tough, and Miller knows what to do with it better than probably any writer out there today. If you're looking to get into Daredevil, or just want to check out a first class trade paperback, this one is for you."
3,CLASSIC ROCKABILLY,LISTEN TO THIS CD TO LEARN ABOUT THE BEGINGING OF ROCKABILLY.GREAT. GOOD FOR A BBQ ON A HOT SUMMER DAY.
2,Tarnished Hopes,"I purchased this book a year ago and found many of its ideas quite provocative. Also I am in the planning stages of developing a farmstead home for which I want an attached solar greenhouse. My home plans encompass crushed volcanic rock, earthbaggs, roundwood, a northside earth bearm and a southside solar green house.Within the last 10 days I sent Anna Edey two emails with links to my home plan and have made one phone call to her answering machine. Thus far our heroine of a greener world has ignored me. I expressed an intention to purchase a $250 set of her drawings and also a $50 drawing on her suspended grow tubes. I had hoped to find a way to adopt the solviva concept to my home plan. It seems that green angel Anna has no regard whatsoever toward guiding me, thus my Solviva dream is rapidly evaporating."
2,Disappointing,"Solviva is Anna Edey's philosophy on life and what she would do if she was president. When she actually talks about her solar greenhouse design she is very vague and leaves the reader with many questions. After making contact with Anna it seems that she was vague so that she could sell blueprints to her solar greenshouse fore 200 bucks a set. Gee, I wonder what she cares about?"
2,So Sad,"Its true not true to size, and after exchanging them for the next 1/2 size they still were not right... You have to deal with the fact they flop off the back of your foot when you walk or go for the crunched toes for them to not flop. Cant win with these but they are unique and very cute on the foot."
2,Disapointing,"Overly technical in places and light on information in others, limited illustrations and photos are very small not the authors best work, the hardcover version only has a glued spine and as such started to split almost immediately."
2,Another English mainstream history book.,"I purchased this book from Doubleday Military History Club at an exurberant price here in Australia. (I could have gotten it for less from Amazon). The high price heightened my expectations. But, alas, what a letdown. When I read retoric like: ...giving Hitler an atomic bomb to further his dreams of world dominion... it makes me laugh. The other typical flaw of Bitish books is the German spelling. Mr Hogg, buy yourself a German Dictionery from Amazon at a reasonable price, take some history lessons from Mr David Irving and then write a book on the British atomic tests in Maralinga, Australia."
4,Read the instructions,"In order to charge the unit and the spare battery together, you must plug both AC adaptors in,(slightly poor design). I didnt figure that out for two days until I read the instructions. Otherwise, delivery was as expected the unit works as expected."
5,We have Porkins! Red Six has come home at last,"He did not watch his deflectors, and was tragically lost. But he lives again in this figure. The details are great. I am not removing the packaging in order to keep it mint. I really like how they designed the packaging to stand upright on it's own. Porkins now sits on top of my cube at work, inspiring all who think they got it, to watch their deflectors, and pull up."
3,Partially pumped,"Falling on the accessibly fun side of Mr. Bungle-esque schiz-rock, Ectopia brandishes all of the studio smarts and chameleon-like production found in engrossing hyper-fused music, though usually without much of the compositional drive to take it past the point of merely entertaining."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book for those of you who are interested in The American Indian and their history in the American Southwest. While this book is written like a college text book and is sometimes a little difficult to plow through, it has information that I have not found in other books written on this topic. I think it, along with ""A History of the Ancient Southwest,"" by Leakson; ""The Fourth World of the Hopis,"" by Courlander; ""Pumpkin Seed Point,"" by Waters; ""Book of the Hopi,"" by Waters; ""Hopi - Stories of Witchcraft, Shamanism, and Magic,"" by Malotki/Gary and ""Hopi,"" by Page/Page."
1,Poor quality and service,Had the unit for 1 year and then had a problem with the pump not working on the expresso maker. Sent the unit into NJ for repair paying $125 and they only cleaned the unit. After 3 uses the problem reappeared. Sent the unit back again with explicit instructions on problem. They returned the unit stating they could not find a problem. After talking with the RUDE manager. He stated if he could not find a problem he could not fix it. Would not recommend this product or the service.
2,Was Great - Once!,"Okay on old windows this might've been great. I had to play some really tough tricks to get this to work on XP.So, great, but long, long ago. Now, with the newer OS's I would shy away from this.Too old to be sold."
1,WARNING: OBSOLETE SOFTWARE,Read the fine print carefully: not compatible with Windows XP. How on earth can you sell software in 2009 that requires an 11 year old operating system to run? Now I have a $[...] drink coaster...
3,It's just okay.,"My chisels don't fit well into the guide because they are not bevelled on the sides, so I would only recommend this guide for people who own chisels with bevelled sides. It works fairly well for wide plane blades, though."
3,Great for plane irons.,"This guide does a fine job on the irons for standard bench and block planes. Planes with smaller irons such as thumb planes and little rabbet planes aren't long enough to get enough extension on the iron to set the angle.None of my chisels would fit this guide. The 'beefy' part of the chisel would hit the guide frame before there was adequate extension. Might be just me - perhaps all my chisels are worn down and too short. If your chisels are longer than mine, it should work fine."
4,Works very well,"The only downside I have experienced with this product is that one has to be careful when clamping thick edged chisels and thick, narrow plane irons to make sure they are installed flat. With wider plane irons there are no problems."
5,Great little item,"These devices can cost an inordinate amount. This one is a great price and used with the ""scary Sharp"" method is a real gem."
3,It does the intended purpose,"While this item operates as intended, it is hard to get some items between its jaws perfectly straight, aka parallel with the stone. Once you get it set up properly it works as intended."
2,It does the job... if you are patient and work slowly to get the angle right.,"What do you expect for the price. The side grooves that supposedly hold your chisel in place doesn't seem completely flat and square to the side of the blade, and seem too small to accomodate thicker chisels. If you have the cash, I would highly recommend the more expensive ones that give you more support for the blade as you try to adjust the angle."
4,Nice little jig,I like this for my plane irons. The only thing that I use it for. Seems very sturdy and well made. I see all the posts about sharpening chisels and I have not tried to do that as of yet so I can not comment. I bought a buck bros block plane at HD. I used this to sharpen the blade and thank God that I have this cuz it would have been a nightmare to sharpen without. I wish I had a a bench sharpener for these situations.
1,Horrible,"The roller is not sitting tight.This causes excessive grinding on left and right sides of the plane iron.The guide doesn't hold the iron in 90 degree position.Can't hold the irons for rabbit planes ( which are narrow top and wide bottom ).I tossed in the garbage and used my old Stanley guide ( I got the Larson's guide after reading some reviews in the books for this type of guide ).Big mistake, especially I couldn't return it ( the return window expired )."
1,Dissatisfied....,"The design is simple and inexpensive. A roller with a metal brace attached. Unlike some other models I found, this one is made out of metal instead of plastic so it will probably last considerably longerI bought it thinking it would be just the ticket for sharpening a bunch of old chisels in my tool box. Unfortunately I couldn't get half the chisels to sit in the guide properly which made it unusable for those. Secondly, you have to position the chisel with a certain length extending from the front depending on if you want a 25 or 30 degree angle. If you don't measure ""perfectly"" you won't get the right angel and the chisel won't sharpen properly.I'm now looking for a design with a FIXED angle."
4,Holds a good angle but it slips,"it holds a good angle but it feels like it not tight enough. you really need to bear down on the screw to get it tighten enough around my chisels. once i had it tight it worked good. on the larger chisels it slip once, but once corrected it was fine."
3,So So,The price is right not a serious tool. Does ok with long chisels. Does not work with 1/4 inch chisels or short shanks.
4,Good inexpensive basic honing guide,"I purchased this to try and salvage some basic chisels that had seen better days; using in combination with a reversible water stone, I've had pretty good luck bringing the chisels back from the grave. My only real issue with this unit is that there is a bevel cut in the narrow section for the chisel to fit into to keep it level. My stanley chisels go from a fine bevel to no bevel pretty quick along the sides, so I ended up seating the chisels low by the cross bars. That works, but if you do it you will want to really watch and make sure you're sitting on the stone at the right angle. Otherwise, no real complaints, this is a very inexpensive option compared to some of the others, which I just can't justify for doing basic chisel sharpening."
4,IT WORKS!!,"Some folks have trouble with this jig/guide. As someone else stated, apply pressure only on the cutting edge and you will be rewarded with a fine cutting edge! It's up to you how far you want to go. I use 3 different diamond grits and finish with a simple oil stone. I hang doors and install locks so for me, I'm not looking for a shaving edge. I've saved a tool bag full of Stanley wood chisels from having to be replaced! I suppose I'm lucky as all my Stanley and one Japanese chisel, has fit this guide without difficulty. Your mileage may vary."
1,absolute garbage!,"If I could rate this thing zero stars I would! I bought it because it was much less expensive than similar items, I immediately regret that decision. The jaws that are supposed to hold a chisel square are curved. So you cannot obtain/maintain square contact with the whetstone. It also does not tighten down sufficiently, even with a screwdriver, to keep the bevel angle constant. In short I can produce much better edges by hand then using this hunk of junk. I know it's much cheaper than similar items but that shouldn't mean you can't have at least a little quality. The side for plane irons may do better but I've not tried it yet. The only reason I'm willing to give it one star is because Amazon packaged and shipped it quite well."
2,honing guide,"this product was not as good as i had hoped, it was difficult to master and not stable did not work well for me but was shipped fast and in good condition"
3,Know what you're doing,"I have always sharpened by touch because I am legally blind. I figured some sort of jig like this would be a bit easier (yeah, can YOU tell the difference between 25 and 30 degrees BY EYE?). While this does help, do not miss the details about how far to extend the blades for a given angle; off by a fraction and it's bad news.Another issue that others have mentioned is how it holds the blades; that's due to being a powder-coated piece. If it had a better/different finish, I think it would hold things more accurately."
4,Good deal for the price,"Chisels and plane irons don't really need to be sharpened that often for most of us, so for the money it's a good deal. wider blades would fit better if it wasn't painted, but, for the price I'm happy with it."
4,Works well if careful,"Nicely built and effective, but would be better if the clamp chunks were of harder metal and not painted. As I sharpened my first chisel, I noticed it was not being cut perfectly square, but was able to correct it by filing off just a little paint, and aluminum under it, on the side with the curved face. Not sure why one side is curved, but it's clearly deliberate so there must be a reason.Also, I wonder why the wheel is only half an inch wide. You have to be careful not to rock it off-flat as you pull the chisel back. Not hard, but would be even easier with a wider wheel."
1,Hard to use consistantly,Very difficult to sharpen a chisel evenly. Can't get the chisel into this device so that you aren't sharpening one side or the other first. It is the same product as the Footprint 90051 Honing Guide. Spend a little more and get a better product.
2,Larson Honing guide,"The guide seems to be well made, but does not accomodate the edge profiles of my chisels, hence the chisels wobble during honing. I plan to take the guide with me to the home center to purchase a new set of chisels that are held firmly. I need a new set anyway, but I'll have to admit that I was unhappy with this product. I don't know how one would tell if this guide fit your chisels without just trying it on the chisels to be sharpened."
2,Poorly Made,I haven't as of yet found something that will fit this jig. I have multiple chisels and the groves in this thing aren't even strait and its impossible to hold the tool at the correct angle and tighten it down.LOOK ELSE WHERE.
2,HONING GUIDE,"I AM KIND OF DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS GUIDE,, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER,,, MY CHISELS DOESN'T STAY IN PLACE AND SLIPS AWAY ALL THE TIME, I WILL HAVE TO FILE A BIGGER GROVE IN ORDER TO HOLD THEM IN PLACE"
3,Good for small planes and chisels,"Does what it promises for smaller chisels and plane blades, larger ones don't fit snugly. You might want to use a longer sharpening stone because the honing guide takes up a lot of space behind the blade."
1,Robert Larson Honing Guide Thumbs Down,"This honing guide does not work with chisels that have flat sides. All my chisels have flat sides? Common sense 101, cannot fit a square peg into a round hole. The sides of the chisel are flat and the honing guide notches which are supposed to grip the chisel are small bevels. End result, the chisel cannot be clamped. Screw head knurls have sharp edges and the head is too small in diameter to apply sufficient finger pressure to clamp. Wasted money, returned to mother nature. Given sufficient time it will break down and leach into someones water supply. Sorry"
2,useless for chisels,"This guide is OK for plane blades but it is useless for chisels because it does not hold them accurately. The grooves in the honing guide do not fit the majority of my chisels. If you want a multi-purpose blade/chisel honing guide, look elsewhere."
2,Poor Quality,"The first time I used this honing guide I noticed that the pattern on the chisel blade was not square (started on a corner, rather than evenly across the face). It turns out the jaws of the guide are not square. One jaw is rotated perhaps 2 degrees past the other. As a result, the chisel is clamped slightly out of square. Not good. Too cheap to return."
1,Wheel locked up,"I used this guide only a handful of times before it was junk. As I used it, the wheel locked up and I did not realize it. As I sharpened my blade, I also was grinding down the wheel. Once the wheel broke loose again, the whole jig went bump, bump, bump. This makes putting on a keen edge impossible as the angle changes every time the wheel bounces over its flattened area. I believe this flaw is because of cheap construction - the bearing is not quality and is not sealed well to keep the slurry out. If the slurry infiltrates the wheel bearing, it will lock up and you too will need a new one if you don't catch it in time."
4,Cannes Job,"The same year Frank & Co. took down Vegas in Ocean's Eleven, Edward G. Robinson's crew tried this lesser-known, European caper. Henry Hathaway directed, and it's a very widescreen picture - not easily enjoyed on DVD. But when the heist goes live you'll tax the edge of your seat as you ponder the picture's ingenious hook: ""Who will bitch out?"" (Not as successful is the de rigueur convention that ""crime doesn't pay,"" and the too neat wrap-up)With his roughhewn street smarts, Rod Steiger is an odd choice to don a tuxedo and mingle with royalty, but he has a terrific rapport with Robinson, and their scenes are superb. Set aside your preconceptions about Joan Collins, she gives a good no-nonsense performance here. And her beatnik basement, be-bop interpretive dance is actually, pretty sexy and not as nearly as ridiculous as it should be.What's with the meager commentary track here? Did someone forget to press both ""Play"" and ""record""?"
4,Gripping crime story.,This is a cool movie if you like some tense organized crime movies. This one was very much like a non-comical Ocean's 11.
3,One Thief too Many,"I rented ""Seven Thieves"" because Edward G. Robinson was in the cast. He gave his usual professional delivery and he had some backing as well although Rod Steiger's ""angry young man"" act was a bit much. The plot had an extra twist or two which kept my interest. The problem I had with this film was Joan Collins. Mind you, I normally don't have a problem with Joan Collins but in ""Seven Thieves"" she plays the role of a nightclub dancer and it is downright embarassing to watch. She gets up and skips around on her tip-toes to the music of her boy friend's saxaphone. It's bad enough we see her twice at the nightclub but the producers actually super-imposed her twinkle-toes act on the opening cast and credits. This could be written off as a casting credit but the fault, in my book, goes to the director who should have had Miss Collins dubbed in the act of a torch singer instead. Enjoy the rest of the film but, if you like her cabaret routine, you're focussed on the wrong things."
2,Joan Collins Collection,"These movies were sometimes allright, but a little slow in nature. Some were kind of cute in their own way. Stopover Tokyo was probably the best of these."
3,...'Thieves' Doesn't Steal Your Attention,"By today's standards, SEVEN THIEVES is a lackluster crime caper but interesting for it's cast. Edward G. Robinson (SOYLENT GREEN),Rod Steiger(MARS ATTACKS, OKLAHOMA!) Eli Wallach (THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN,THE GOOD BAD AND THE UGLY) and Joan Collins (ROAD TO HONG KONG,tv's DYNASTY) play a somewhat motley crew out to rob a Monte Carlo Casino, each with a specific role of expertise to pull off the heist. It may be a little talky, not much action but plausible heist plan, a few decent moments of suspense, a couple of predictable twists and turns (particularly near the end), and some nice Monte Carlo scenery but it seems dated (especially in its black and white film stock). The real highlight of the film is seeing a young Joan Collins in two exotic dance sequences, otherwise the caper, plot, and characters are generic compared to today's caper films. Note: Look for Sabastian Cabot (Mr. French on tv's FAMILY AFFAIR) in a support role."
3,Good but could be better...,"Good product but a bit noisy as a few components of the clippers rattle a bit. Doesn't seem to get as close a shave for the ""zero"" setting as past Vidal Sassoon clippers that I've owned. Probably wouldn't buy this exact product again given the opportunity or need."
5,NYHC Classic,"Possibly the greatest hardcore CD ever, Warzone breaks out the 88 NY style with a pure message about unity, living in NYC and the scene that surrounds it."
5,"Hardcore, end of story.","One of the greatest examples of a near dead art: hardcore. There were few bands outside of the New York hardcore family, now or ever, that touched as many people as Warzone. Led by Raybeez (R.I.P.), whose lryics speak of what life was for a kid on the streets in New York City. This album is a must buy for anyone who thinks they're hard enough. REST IN PEACE RAY!!!!!!!"
3,New York Hardcore but not a marvel!!!!!,"Well you cannot say this the greatest hardcore work, when you compare this album to releases by Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Youth Of Today, Black Flag, Misfits, Necros or Negative Approach, maybe it's one of the greatest NY hardcore stuff, that's all. The lyrics aren't very clever, the music could be better...even if I'm a fan of Warzone especially give props to them for the ""Sound Of Revolution"" video clip, I know the truth, as would Ray Beez say, ""open your ears "" to other bands and compare!"
1,Insufficient info to purchase,I want to buy a mat. This description is pathetic! How do I know if it will fit my sink? Description says it's available in several sizes - where? Which one is this? It doesn't even give the dimensions - Huh??
1,Not All-Star Material,"The story of how Omar Minaya refashioned the Mets - from perennial bottom feeders into genuine contenders, in two short seasons - is indeed an appropiately Amazin' tale. In fact, Minaya is not finished yet, and there is still work to be done. However, Adam Rubin has taken the first two of Minaya's moves - the enlistment of Pedro and Carlos Beltran in the winter of 2004/5 - as the basis for his book. Alas, his writing neither matches nor illuminates any of the very distinctive characters involved, nor does it shed any particular light on the sea-change that Minaya has instituted within the Mets organization. The book is enjoyable enough, at least for most Mets fans, simply because it replays two very enjoyable events - but it lacks depth. I know - it's only baseball - but still, more is required. The best of sports books have it - but this one doesn't."
1,What Y2K bug??,"I can't think of anything more thoroughly debunked than the myth that January 1, 2000 was going to cause catastrophic failure throughout the world. Countries that did nothing at all to prepare fared just as well as the U.S., so to claim that de Jager ""helped"" by feeding the hysteria is insulting. I see that this book is no longer available. Good!"
5,Space and Time with a splash of imagintation,"This book is deliciously satistfying to the imaginative mind! If your looking for diverse science fiction with creativity and a flare for the unusal, this book has it! A gay man, a homeless man, two African woman and a Hispanic woman thrown into utter confusion when they are taken to Chronos a planet of all things TIME. A MUST READ book for all fans of anything time travel even though this book does not really deal in time travel, it does deal with TIME and it is worth all the time and money to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!,"This DVD is NOT an official release. It is a full screen, video to DVD transfer and a terrible one at that. The tape the company used looks like a worn rental tape complete with tracking errors and audio crackling here and there.Do NOT purchase this DVD, you will be overpaying for what basically is a bootleg.By the way, the 1 star rating is NOT for the film itself - it is just for this release. Don't get duped into paying $30 for what bootleggers have been selling - with better quality tapes/cover art - for years. It's a rip off and it's downright criminal."
5,why is this not on DVD!!!,"If you liked ""return of the living dead"" you will love this one. Out of all the zombie films this one has the best looking zombies from the 80's"
1,0 stars!,"There's a magical T.V. that only plays zombie flicks. Some goober finds it and falls in love with a chick who looks like a man from the zombie movie. Then zombies arise from the t.v. to choke the living (not eat). So the goober, a cowboy, and some chicks must lure the zombies back in the T.V. set.Do not even bother with this film. It's the most dumbest film i have ever seen. So bad that I rather be watching ZOMBIE RAMPAGE. It's an insult to zombie films everywhere.(7 zombies) (my luckiest count)the most entertaining part: | when the kid was laughing while smoking a dooby and watching tv |"
4,Interesting look at the renowned lover/hunter Baron Blixen,"Baron Bror Blixen was so noted for the admiration he excited in women, that his hunting clients were only half jokingly advised to write in their contracts that he refrain from seducing their wives. Best known for being the husband of Izaak Dinesen and also for being the inspiration for a Hemingway short story, he's well worth reading about on his own merits. The author is the Baron's godson and has an inside and affectionate perspective on his famous godfather."
2,disappointing,"Of all the thrilling stories about great white hunter Bror Blixen I was sure this book would be great, it wasn't. Dull and boooooooooooring, it was written by a relative of Bror so I assumed it would be good. But the photographs were fantastic and rare."
4,"Excellent, but starting to show it's age","This book has great, detailed information about writing and publishing your family history. I recommend it to anyone who is considering tackling such an effort.My only disappointment is that the computer publishing information is so dated. Obviously it's hard to write about computers without the information quickly becoming out-of-date, but there have been such huge advances in desktop publishing since this book's release (in 1997) that a second edition is really overdue."
5,I think this is a fun and useable toy for anything,I think this toy is amazing.Kids could use it for anything and its fun and easy to use anywhere. You have a lot a space for anything that u need it for. I know and that this is a number #1 toy.
1,not worth the money!,"I have had this blender for two years and hardly use it until recent last 6 months making smoothies. At first I really liked it and then the carafe started leaking and having hard time getting the smoothies made. Called customer service and they said there was a defect in the blades and was mailing me another pitcher. It came a few weeks ago and though it does not leak anymore, I can't make a simple frozen smoothie without a big production. Stopping and stirring and adding more and more liquid! I think it is a faulty motor and it is no longer under warranty! It only lasted me less than 2 years with min. usage!!! Don't buy!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this blender 14 months ago and it started leaking today, 2 months after the warranty expired. I use it only about once a week to make smoothies, using frozen fruit that are in small pieces. It is not worth the price. My previous blender lasted longer and was much cheaper."
3,Noisy,I got rid of my old blender because it was too noisy--thought a new one would be quieter. Seems I wasted my money. This one is just as noisy as my old one.
1,Blender Jar Defective/Leaks,"I purchased this blender for morning smoothies for the family. After a few uses the jar started to crack, much like a windshield would if hit by a rock, the cracks started from the four drainage holes at the bottom on the outside of the jar and went inward toward the blades. Soy milk or orange juice would leak out everywhere, I dealt with it for a while because the blender was new and it was a hundred dollars. I made my last angry smoothie and dumped the thing in the trash. I'm using my food processor until I can find a better blender. Because of the split and cracks that happened at the base of this jar, I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Don't buy if you are planning to make Smoothies,"Don't buy this blender if you are planning to make smoothies. We had great expectations with this blender but we are very dissapointed on its performance, This one only last for year and a half. Considering buying a heavy duty blender...will see"
1,Save Your Money,Don't fall for the Kitchenaid name on this product. It will fail and you will be stuck with a leaky version of a good looking blender.Ultimately the one piece blade/jar assembly will fail and you will need to replace it. And that is the entire jar not just the blade assembly as it is one piece. GOOD LUCK FINDING ONE. They have been back ordered for months which should give you as a potential purchaser of the product some insight that there is a real problem with the design of the jar.All those five star reviews.................just wait and I bet all of them will want to change their minds.
4,Purrrr,"This thing works like a charm. Easy to use, easy to clean and lots of power. That said, I have hit a snag, but getting into contact with KitchenAid was simple -- and replacement was a cinch. Powering through frozen fruits and veggies is a tough business, so if you sense that your machine is working a bit too hard... have a heart and let it take a mini-break. That's my plan for making sure to get longevity."
1,Leaks after less than a year of use.,"This blender worked ok for most chores. We used it mostly for blending smoothies (ice, frozen fruit, fresh fruit, etc.), but within a year after we purchased it the jar leaked. It started with a small leak, but now leaks continuously and is useless.After researching for a fix it appears this is a problem with KitchenAid blenders in general after using for awhile. There is no fix. If you do a search for ""KitchenAid Blender leaking"" you will be amazed at how prevalent this problem is."
2,KitchenAid Blender,"I really liked this blender for the first 2 weeks and thought it would be a keeper. It looked so good on my counter, too. Since the blades are permanently fixed, you would not expect it to leak. Wrong. The blender started spitting/throwing liquid underneath the base of the jar, from where the blades are affixed; so I had to return it. I had read a few reviews about it leaking, but figured they were just defective and mine would probably be ok. If it wasn't for the leak, this blender would have rated a 5 plus stars, because I really did like the performance and the sleek look."
1,not happy,"I love KitchenAid however I am not happy with this product. After using my blender for around a year, off and on, I noticed that it had developed a leak on the bottom of the polycarbonate jar. When I call KitchenAid they assured me that this was unusual so I went ahead and ordered a new jug. It took months for the new jug to come in and when it did I noticed that they had changed the design on the base. I assumed they fixed the problem. When I went to use my replacement jug today I noticed that it to has developed a crack in the side, by the handle. Needless to say I am not amused. I am now looking at buying a new blender with a glass or stainless steel jug. Save your money and buy a different model."
5,amazing peice of engineering,"I will fully admit that I am one of the people that has a hard time paying for the big items of a kitchen when I have always made some good food with a hand mixer and an attitudinal oven for the majority of my life. this, however, became a necessity when I found that the high nutrient shakes, soups and sauces I love actually will burn out the motor of a 'regular' blender. This blender, however, is the amped up navy-seal older brother of the best blender I have ever seen before. It crushes ice, blends evens partially knotty/dried kale into creamy smooth textured shakes and on and on. its a little loud at first, due to the crunch of the stuff its eating, but I have a feeling that cannot be helped. the solid peice jar cleans pretty easy, though i wouldnt suggest letting things crust on it, since you cant take it apart to get in there. also, dont seal the lid on it if you are going to blend a hot liquid. the engine starts VERY fast and steam will blow the lid off."
3,KitchenAid Blender,"The blender seems made well. It is easy to clean. It powers through soups and purees. However, I bought it primarily to make smoothies for my kids. It gets them smooth but I have to stop every 2 seconds to get rid of the annoying air pocket that forms. If you don't mind stopping 15-20 times while you are making your smoothie to stir it, it does a good job. What can I say...it is heads and shoulders above my old Hamilton Beach blender. For the price, I am happy with the blender. Maybe Santa will bring me a Vita-mix."
3,"Nancee J. Swartz, 29, Maryland","Nancee J. Swartz, 29, Maryland. I own the KitchenAid Professional 5-Speed Blender and it is a very useful appliance for blending and baking mixes. It is easy to clean and comes with instructions for usage and cleaning. I recommend it as an addition for any kitchen."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I seriously regret ever purchasing this blender. the Jar and blade assembly are of incredibly poor quality. mine has completely seized within one year of light use.Not sure if i will even bother with any attempt to replace.When it was functioning properly, it was a 5 star machine. but if you can't make something to last, don't make it at all.Piece of junk.additional note...the blade assembly on the jar is NOT replaceable! so, then why does it have a threaded insert and cheap plastic nut to tighten down?it is useless. as others mentioned if if comes loose it will leak. if its too tight it will displace the gasket seal.if you completely loosen the nut, you still cannot remove the blade assembly. great job engineering this one...design is awful.design/engineering FAIL."
1,Called customer service and they have done nothing to fix problem with leaks,"I was just about to order this blender when I quickly read the reviews and noticed it has huge issues with the carafe leaking. I called customer service 1-800-541-6390 to see if they had done anything to fix this problem. No, they had not and would not even admit that there were any leak issues!!! I guess no one over at Kitchenaid has the ability to read!!!!She said it had a one year warranty....I am not going to buy a small appliance for $140 that most likely will break from all the reading I have done.STAY AWAY FROM KITCHENAID-THEY SEEM TO NOT CARE WHEN THEIR PRODUCTS DO NOT HOLD UP!!!On a side note I own a Kitchenaid pro 600 mixer that I do love, but it quit running after a year. I had to spend over $100 to fix it. The repair man asked me what I was mixing when it died on me. Try mashed potatoes! I doubt my grandma's Kitchenaid mixer broke after only 1 year."
1,Disappointed!,For my bridal shower I received two of the Kitchen Aid Blenders. Both of them in the same year stop working I barley used them. I tried exchanging them for new ones and they only change one for a refurbish model they said because I called after the year so they don't have a warranty. I am really disappointed with the products and the services.I would not recommend this blender!
5,Beautiful Product,"Beautiful in appearance and in operation! This was a gift for friends who have a new apartment, and they are thrilled with it. Having one myself, I knew that they would be happy. Another great product by KitchenAid!"
5,Tangerine Happiness,We couldn't be happier with our perfectly matched Kitchenaid blender. It's a sea of tangerine in our kitchen.
1,Poor materials.,"This blender is solid and does a good job until the teeth break of the coupling. Then you have to buy a new one and replace it. not that hard, but silly waste of time. To put salt on the wound, kitchen aide charges 14 dollars for the part. Wow! It's a defect in the appliance idiots. Way to go. good advertising. Don't hold your breath kitchen aide, maybe you need to reconsider your approach. What a joke!!"
5,Kitchen blender,Wife uses it two to three times a day and wouldn't be without one. She mixes diet shakes that help keep her healthy
1,broken first day,"I bought this hoping that it would be a superior Kitchenaid product. My last Kitchenaid blender lasted for about 20 uses! Unfortunately, I didn't use it often so it was way out of warranty. It was a very different design so stupidly I thought that with all the good reviews this one would be different.After making my first smoothie, I filled the container with water and a little soap as the directions suggested to clean and it all started running out the bottom all over the counter. The whole blade assembly was loose. Then my husband looked at it and not only was it loose but the gasket was not in the right place.Needless to say it is going back to the store and I am not buying another Kitchenaid blender. I love my kitchenAid mixer and food processor but they just can't get this design right!"
3,Quit working after two years,"This blender is good looking and works well, but for the price I don't feel it lasted very long. I did use it for making smoothies with frozen fruit so maybe that was too much for it. I won't buy another one."
4,worth paying a little more for a good blender,"I was a little disappointed at first because I thought I ordered the one with the glass pitcher, but this was polycarbonate. I thought it would not hold up, but it has been great. It crushes ice really well and it is a little quieter than the one I replaced. I make a lot of smoothies and it really does a great job of blending everything."
5,KitchenAid blender,This is a very powerful blender! I have used it everyday for 2 weeks and have not seen any leaking.
5,Best Blender for the money.,The 56-Ounce pitcher is more than enough space for any blending application. We have only used it so far for frozen drinks and it really does a great job.
1,It leaks out the bottom,"I have owned other Kitchenaid appliances and always been happy with them. So when I was researching a heavy duty blender to whip up smoothies I was pleased that the Kitchenaid blender was highly rated. Everything went well at first until it started leaking from the bottom. Thinking this was an isolated incident I exchanged it for another one. The same thing happened after a short while. There is a design flaw in this blender. Unfortunately, I must rate this blender poorly and return it. I will have to start my search for a good blender again."
2,kitchenaid blender,"We've had this blender for about 5 years. My DH started replacing all our small appliances with Kitchenaid in the hopes that they wouldn't break down so quickly. The motors don't break down, but the parts do. Replacing the parts is not so easy. The company tends to discontinue them rather quickly. We ended up having to replace the $55 handmixer because a beater broke, and now the $90 blender because the cutter blade has stripped out...we tend to use it only on birthdays for virgin daiquiris, or during strawberry season for sorbet. Not happy with parts and company policies."
2,Leaked tbe first time I used it,"I bought the unit locally and have used it five times so far. The jar has leaked three of those times, each time it has leaked more. I also noticed a burning odor each time I used the unit. I read the reviews, both good and bad, but decided to give it a try after looking at in the store. The unit appears to be well-made and I liked the fact the base is so heavy. I liked the touchpad controls and the number of speeds available. The noise level on Stir and Liquidify doesn't seem excessive. I will be returning the blender shortly and start looking a replacement."
2,worked great while it lasted,"Nice big size, nice speed options. It worked very well, but it lasted just over a year and was probably used 15 times, mostly for soups and other non-taxing tasks. I don't see any point in spending more than $30 bucks on a blender since none of them seem to last."
2,Does Not perform as I would expect,"Does Not perform as I would expect. I am not happy with it and so consequently don't use it much. I bought it to replace a cheap blender I use for smoothies, but it works just as well as the more expensive Kitchen Aid."
4,Kitchen Aid from Amazon,"This blender has plenty of power. My wife likes to make smoothies with frozen berries, ice, ice cream, yogurt and a banana, it whips it up in no time and clean up is simple."
4,"Nice ergonomics, what's up with the cord storage?","I've used this exactly one night to puree jalapenos. Feels substantial, has obvious horsepower, easy to clean, but I have no idea what they expect me to do with the power cord storage."
1,lasted 1 month!,"Even though this is a good brand, this is a lousy blender. Kids use it to make smoothies, and after the first month the blender burned up. The bottom part of the blender burned up and fell off. Will not purchase this one again, waste of money."
1,Broke the first time I used it,"I received this blender last night and it broke this morning when my husband was making a smoothie--the first time we used it! The plastic ""cog"" on the bottom of the pitcher that fits into the base shredded when we turned on the blender."
1,The leaking reviews are accurate,"Unfortunately, I've also found the carafe to be a big leaker through the blade attachment, when I make a smoothie in the morning, it's all I can do to pull it from the base to the sink without a trail of banana blueberry on the floor. Every use the blade gets hand tightened, and all that does is postpone the leaking a few minutes.I could see if this was a cheap introductory level blender, but shame on KitchenAid for knowing of this flaw and keeping it on the market at a premium price. I think we are starting to see KitchenAid quality buckling under competition, as it's not the first item to fail me as of late, but that's for another review."
2,Great power - poor polycarb jar,I did extensive research on blenders prior to buying this one. Our use is pretty much limited to smoothies and shakes. It worked wonderfully for the first few months but then I started noticing the little cracks on the bottom of the polycarb jar. They steadily got worse and then started to leak. I thought the power of the machine was fabulous but the jar was terrible and I see from another few reviews that this isn't an isolated incident.
4,So far so good,"It does the trick, I have used it twice and it makes a mean milkshake.Not too happy about all the plastic in the pitcher..gears etc. However it does churn up the fruit and ice for a great smoothie."
5,KitchenAid KSB560,Excellent blender/smoothie maker. Huge jar to make adult drinks and very durable. Definitely worth a few extra dollars for the quality.
5,Very nice blender,"I've used the blender for a few different things including crushing ice, blending smoothies and pureeing. It works just fine and seems to be much sturdier than my old blender which broke. I bought the chrome color and find it to be very attractive. Overall, I'm very pleased."
5,love it!,Love love love it! Should have gone with Kitchen Aid from the beginning! Will be forever loyal to Kitchen Aid!!!!
3,I got disappointed,"I bought this item which I had great expectations of it. However, I did have a great problem just after I started to use it. It leaks, and I do not know why? moreover, before leaking the rotatoty part did not turn properly and smelled bad right before it started leaking. I had a bad luck? I do not know...I have got other KitchenAid items before and this is the first time I am having a problem. Anyway, I think I will need a new upper part of the blender."
2,KitchenAid KSB5600B,"If it did not leak from the bottom it would be four stars, with a better lid, five stars."
4,So far so good!,We have gone through three other blenders this year. So far this one has done everything it claims. It is great for crushing ice and making my husbands smoothies. The heavy duty plastic liquid container part has been great as the others were glass and got chips and cracks in them. This has been a good blender for us.
4,Great machine but...,This Kitchen aid blender does everything I wanted it to do. The power is great (it looks nice on the counter:) - the carafe is large and wide - but it only gets 4 stars because it started leaking from the base within a week. It's not a huge leak but it is a leak that has to be cleaned up every time. Kitchen aid sent me a new carafe which I will start using today to see if this fixes the problem.
5,Vastly improved Kitchen Aid Blender,"We had an earlier version of this blender, the one where the base comes apart with its gaskets, and the top came apart also with gasket. The new one part jar and top work flawlessly and are so much easier to clean. We got the more powerful model and it makes a difference in speed and efficacy of the (chop whirl puree). Some reviewers have said its a noisy machine, but we do not find this at all to be annoying, more like a finely tuned engine humming along doing what its supposed to do. The motor and case are heavy..its stays put. Last, the old Kitchen Aid models weren't good at blending small quantities, but the design of this jar totally fixes that..it whips up nicely regardless of large or small amounts. Only had the unit a month but we are testing it hard as this is harvest season an she's doin real good!"
1,It leaks!,"Do not buy this blender!! The jar leaks out the bottom. I got a replacement under warranty, and it worked for a few uses, now it's leaking again. Very poor quality, go with a brand beside KitchenAid."
1,burning smell!,I just bought this blender and found that it has a strong burning electrical smell. I am afraid it will start a fire so I am returning it to KitchenAid. Of less importance but still annoying is that it sounds like a Boeing 747 when you turn it on. There have to be better blenders out there. Choose one of those!
1,Leaks,"I loved the look of this blender, and it is powerful and blends well. However, the jars leak out the bottom. I have had this blender for 5 months. The first jar started leaking after using the blender less than a dozen times. Kitchenaid promptly sent a replacement jar, which also started leaking after only a couple weeks. The leaking is getting progressively worse and makes quite a mess. Tightening the bolt under the blender jar doesn't help; this is a faulty design."
4,nice and simple,"So far I like this blender. I love the one piece jar that fits easily over the base. No more assembling and twisting. I do prefer glass. It works great and chops ice easily for my lemonade slushies. However, I don't like the sound of the motor. It just sounds like it might have problems down the road. Hopefully I am wrong. Otherwise it is user friendly and easy to use. It fits in the same space as my previous blender. Time will tell how long it holds up. I would only pay the discounted price for this unit. Over $100 is way overpriced for the overall quality."
2,Pitcher will leak sooner rather than later,"The motor/base on this Blender is excellent! However the Pitcher is absolutely horrible. If you use your blender on any type of regular basis - it will leak on you sooner rather than later and you can't fix it!I make smoothies about 4 days out of the week for breakfast - my first pitcher had a catastrophic leak with gasket chunks in the smoothie about 10 months into ownership - Kitchenaid warranty support, while not expedient in replies, eventually sent me a replacement pitcher. On this second pitcher - it lasted 6 months. I have another replacement coming in - I'm really debating if I just want to throw it on ebay with the new pitcher....I know pitchers/jars are not going to last forever, since they rely on a gasket. However Kitchenaid really should have designed the the pitcher/jar on this blender to be end user serviceable - not bolted togetherNew pitcher jar - between $40-65, new gasket - between $2-5Get a blender with user serviceable pitcher/jar."
1,Don't Bother!!!,"I spent A LOT of time researching blenders before choosing this one. I ignored the complaints about the pitcher leaking, believing other reviews about the problem being fixed. WRONG! After one month of daily use the pitcher began to leak where the screw, holding the blade on was. I liked the blender's performance, so exchanged the ""defective"" one. Three months later I had the same exact problem. Do not waste your time or money on this blender!"
1,Breaks Easily,Works well until it breaks. The prongs from the base that fit into the jar and do the actual blending break off very easily.
2,Carafe leaks...returned after just over one month,"Well, I thought I finally found the blender for the family to make fruit smoothies every day with. Bought it the day after Christmas and for the first week, it was a dream. Worked flawlessly...and then the nut holding the blade assembly to the carafe loosened and started leaking.I had read about others who experienced this and hoped that KitchenAid would have fixed it by now, but it looks like they haven't. I was able to tightent it and kept an eye on it every time I was going to use it for the next few weeks. I saw one more time that it got loose, so I tightened it again. But then, yesterday, it leaked again. Only this time, I couldn't tighten the nut no matter what I did! So, I returned it and I'm back to looking for a new blender.I was only blending a mix of frozen fruit, frozen berries, bananas, and apple juice. Nothing else. I can't imagine that combination causing this to break the way it did."
4,Good but hard to clean,"Definately well made and had plenty of power. I use my blender daily for morning smoothies, ice crushing, etc. Pitcher is lightweight and seems solid, much larger capacicty than most others. Pulls everything into the blade well/gets things well blended. No doubt that it will hold up well and perform at a high standard.My only complaint is that it's hard to clean. The ""one piece design"" is supposed to be a plus, and the prescribed way to clean it is to fill it with some hot water and dishsoap and run the blade a few seconds, then rinse. But I've still got stuff stuck to the sides, especially lower and on the bottom of the pitcher. The fact that you can't remove the blade to clean those areas seems to be a pretty significant design flaw. You have to be very careful when washing it to avoid cutting yourself."
5,quite pleased,"I was expecting to spend $200 on a VitaMixer or BlendTec, but based upon reviews I saw I decided to go with this one instead and so far I'm very pleased. I do smoothies every morning with frozen strawberries and blueberries, and my old blender couldn't handle the strawberries unless I partially thawed them. This one does it fantastic, even on Mix, which is like the medium speed.It's a bit heavy and has ""sticky"" feet so sliding it back and forth on the counter is a bit of a challenge, but it works. Also the lid has a really tight seal - which means that nothing splatters out, but it also takes quite a tug to get the lid off. Also the blender container is so big, it feels like overkill for just a one-serving smoothie. But it works great., even for a small quantity."
2,Good blender with a major flaw,"I've used this blender for about a year now. It does a good job blending smoothies and creates a nice vortex that evenly blends most (even heavy) frozen foods. However, the MAJOR flaw is the really cheap polycarbonate blender pitcher that cracks quickly after initial use and leaks all over the counter and base. Replacement pitchers are poorly reviewed and have the same problem. I found a glass pitcher designed to fit this blender but it is the same cost as the entire blender is new! Not an investment I'm feeling good about.After much research I've decided to upgrade to a Blendtec unit. The KitchenAid is nice but too flawed to recommend."
2,Buyer beware!,"At first, the Kitchenaid KSB560 was all the ratings said it would be- a sure thing, an excellent product. Our smoothies were fantastic, smooth and creamy! However, a few weeks into usage the unthinkable happened; it started to leak from the bottom. We tightened the blade, but after several uses it loosened again and leaked-- and still does. We are now destined to repeat this cycle. We should have sent the machine back at first opportunity; now we must endure."
2,Kitchen Aid Blender,After a few uses the jar started leaking at the base. Luckily I still had a warranty and Amazon sent me out a complete new one immediately.
5,KitchenAid Blender Round Two,"I hate to admit it, but my husband was correct again! Our blender broke one morning while I was making smoothies for breakfast. I happily went off to work and unbeknownst to me, he did lots of online research to find the best replacement for our old KitchenAid blender. When I got home, we started talking about a replacement and my first words were, ""I certainly won't buy a KitchenAid blender again as I never was thrilled with the first one."" My husband insisted that all the reviews said that the KitchenAid KSB560 was the way to go. I finally acquiesced and ordered one on Amazon, where I found the best price! As I started, he was so right. This is a great blender. The five speeds are actually all different, the polycarbonate jar is strong and easy to clean, and the cord wraps neatly under the base. I am a very happy blender!"
4,Great smoothies but disappointed it leaks,"I saw other reviews saying the jar leaks, but one review said the leak issue was w/ the glass jar model, not the polycarbonate jar model...not true. We make a lot of kale smoothies and I was very pleased with how fine the kale was liquified. Ice and frozen fruit crushing ability was good too. But it seems when running on high speeds, the underside of the jar leaks. It doesn't leak excessively (yet), so I feel the blender is still usable. It just makes it a little messy to clean. Having known this beforehand, I probably would have tried the ninja."
2,"Sleek, firm base, too weak",My wife wanted a red blender to match our kitchenAid mixer. I like everything about it except for it's pathetic top speed. It'll break ice if you want to wait a while. It just won't reve up the way you need it to.
2,Wonderful.. until it breaks,"I'm starting to lose faith in the Cooks Illustrated reviews... 2 top rated items have now given up the ghost in less than 2 years of use.. the 2nd being our KitchenAid blender.It was working great, chopping ice, etc.. but the wife's smoothies proved to be too much for the blade.... one prong bent straight up.. the other straight down (such that it digs in to the bowl)... as I have been shopping for the replacement polycarbonate jars, I see the reviews there are all VERY low.. and I also see many suppliers are back-ordered for the replacement parts, suggesting to me that there are far too many ppl seeing this issue."
4,KitchenAid KSB560OB Blender,"We are very pleased with our purchase of this blender. The quality of construction is pretty much what we had expected for this price tier. The only thing we dislike, is that due to the gear drive design, this blender is pretty noisy. Noisier than any I've ever heard, but then again, if it lasts longer than other brands it will be worth it."
5,We love it!,We love this blender! I recently purchased this for my nutrition shakes and it handles ice very well. I even use it to stir my Crystal Light drinks. Fantastic!
3,Satisfactory,This blender works fine. It doesn't work great. It doesn't process small amounts of food well without a lot of work to get the food to the blade. I've had it for around 4 months now and it's getting the job done just fine though. I just wish it was a bit easier to use for the smaller tasks.
5,this thing is so sweet,"gee, this thing is so sweet. it destroys ice/frozen fruit on the crush setting (that's the lowest). the crush ice settign is actually alittle bit scary i don't know how fervently i can recommend it. but seriously youll be amazed no matter what it is you want to grind up the 56oz capacity and .9 horsepower are enough to send any stupid oster or black and decker machine sulking home with their tails between their legs"
2,Not what I expected,"I did my research ahead of time and thought that by purchasing this relatively expensive blender, it would do what I wanted. I use a blender to mix a softened package of Fat-free Philly Cream Cheese with Harry & David Sweet Onion relish. (Unless I blend the two, the dip is lumpy and unappetizing -- but still delicious.) This dip made with regular cream cheese is fine. It's the consistency of the fat-free that causes the problem. However, because I watch my weight, I want to use the fat-free version. My KitchenAid did not do as well as my less expensive blender that burned out."
3,KitchenAid blender,This blender has a nice look and a plastic jar. It doesn't live up to the Kitchenaid rep. It vibrates so bad when you use it that it moves across the counter. It is powerful but the vibration is really bad.
2,Returned,"I bought this blender based on the positive reviews - I'm very critical of my purchases and really do my research. This blender started off working fine but was never powerful and you would frequently have to stop it and scrape. Then the piece that connects into the motor wore down and the teeth would no longer grab to spin the blade. They don't sell just that piece. That was after just a few months.I returned it for the Ninja Blender and it's amazing. The 3 blades allow it to grab everything and you never have to stop and scrape. It is so powerful it crushes ice, blends right through smoothie mixes - amazing!!"
1,very bad,This is a terrible product. The jar broke within 6 months and the mixer stopped working ONE week after the warranty expired!!! While it worked it was fine but given the problems it gave within this short period it is definitely not worth it.
1,"Horrible blender, do not buy this","This blender is low quality. The motor is not strong enough to blend properly, The blade mechanism results in significant leakage. The plastic container has cracked. POS."
1,Leaks like crazy,The blender jar started leaking after a few uses. We have tightened the nut on the bottom several times but it just starts leaking again after a few more uses. I noticed reviews saying the jar had been redesigned. We purchased this blender in December of 2010 and it still failed.
1,"KitchenAid KSB560OB 5-Speed Blender with Polycarbonate Jar, Onyx Black","A piece of junk.Worked great first 3 times and like another reviewer stated, they made hummus, not overly thick and they smoked it.Identical here...never again."
2,Broken in less than 5 months,"I have decided to buy a Kitchen Aid blender (empire red)during my trip to USA, just after buying a Kitchen Stander Mixer that I highly recommend . I have used the blender a few times during these 5 months, and now it stops to work. I have contacted the USA Kitchen Aid warranty. Hopefully they can fix it, since I am from Brazil."
3,Leaky Top,"I love everything about this blender, except the top. It's rubber, while the ""ingredient cup"" (the middle piece of plastic) is made of plastic. So, the plastic and rubber don't match up exactly and so the lid isn't air tight. I noticed this when cleaning the blender with soap and water and it spilled on the counter. I called customer service and they literally said:""That's the way it works""""I don't understand how a lid that leaks is the way it's suppose to work""""well you can't expect it to be airtight""Good lord. Is a lid that doesn't leak so much to ask for?Thankfully most of what I make doesn't reach the lid since the container is so big, but for $100 I'd think this wouldn't be a problem."
4,Good blender but leaves something to be desired,"Maybe my expectations were too high but I wasn't all that impressed. Only 3 buttons, but maybe that's all that's really needed. Ice crush was better than anything else I've used, but still not as great as I expected."
5,KitchenAid Blender,The blender works extremely well. The reason I bought it was to have a blender that effectively crushes ice. I am highly satisfied with how well this blender crushes ice and mixes foods.
5,Fabulous blender!,"I had a Black & Decker blender, but it was having problems blending my smoothies, which have frozen fruit in them. So my husband found this blender on Amazon and ordered it for me. It's wonderful, and has NO problem with my frozen fruit. I make several smoothies a week and haven't had a single problem yet. Love it!"
3,Very Noisy !,"My old KitchenAid blender finally wore out after 35+ years. After researching on Amazon, I decided to stick with the brand I knew and trusted. Now I am not sure.This thing is extremely noisy compared to the older blender; maybe because of the plastic pitcher, not glass like the old one. And of course it has a more powerful motor too. But the performance is no better than my old blender;especially for making fruit smoothies. Finally, there is a burning odor every time the motor is under load, this does not seem right."
3,Kitchen Aid Blender-Okay,I bought this blender mainly to make smoothies. It does but not very easily or quickly. I guess I will just have to bite the bullet and buy one costing over $300 if I want it to make smoothies as I desire.
5,Love this blender,"We totally killed our cheap blender by making smoothies every night. When I began looking for a new blender I read all the reviews and the reviews on this blender were wonderful. SO we purchased it and we love it. It is so powerful and works wonderfully!! Our smoothies are fast, smooth and delicious in half the time our old blender took!"
4,Awesome!,Awesome :)I am very happy to buy it. I had Black & Decker mixer that broke one day. This one is working great even after almost an year :)
2,Not worth the money,"I use a blender every day to make a protien drink ,after using cheaper models which usually last a year or so ,I purchased this one! just broke after 7 months ,just got a cheaper Oster that does a better job of blending the 4 powders I use .I wouldn't buy this one if you want a nice countertop look ,LOOK elseware ."
1,Polycarbonate Jar Leaks after 30 seconds of use,Bought 11 months ago. Started leaking after a few months of minimal use. Finally found time to call Kitchenaid; they are sending me a free replacement jar.We will see if this one works better.(After each use I retighten the blade and it will work for another 30 seconds or so -- used only for smoothies)
5,Excellent Blender,"While looking for a well built dependable blender came across this model. The blender works great, crushes ice with no problem and does a great job making smoothies or milk shakes."
1,Had High Hopes,"Purchased the Kitchenaid KSB560 blender after my 13 year old Oster beehive classic died. After a lot of research, I settled for the Kitchenaid to make my morning smoothie. After only the third day of use, I'm noticing smoothie product leaking from the base of the blender. Also, this blender will not handle thick, frozen fruit smoothies. I start the unit on it's lowest setting ""stir"" which gets things going, but any higher setting causes the blades to create an air pocket and nothing gets blended. Never had a problem with the Oster. Good thing the retailer where I purchased the Kitchenaid has an excellent return policy because it's going back today.Update: Finally decided to go for it and ordered a Vitamix 5200. Yes, it's expensive, but so far worth every penny. It outperforms every other blender I've tried."
1,NOT GOOD!,BROKE FAST !!!!!!!!! DO NOT GET !!!!!!!!! the base works great. The blade broke from the plastic. I'm not happy!
5,The Best Blender Ever!!,"Chews through ice (can make snow from large ice cubes in seconds), makes commercial quality smoothies, very easy cleanup, huge (56oz) & tough polycarbonite pitcher capacity, and almost impossible to overheat. Used all day for multiple people and this beauty never slowed down. Heavy base keeps unit solid & stable even in the most demanding tasks. We love that the pitcher is self contained and does not need to be disassembled for cleaning, no more losing / breaking small parts like rubber rings in the dishwasher. Would buy this unit again, but by the looks and feel of this one, it may be the last blender we ever own."
1,Epic Fail,"This review is more in sorrow than anger.Our first kitchen blender lasted ten years, before it gave up the ghost. Well we couldn't afford a Vita-mix and we had a good run out our first Kitchen Aid blender. It seemed like a no brainer, buy a new Kitchen Aid blender. So we did.It lasted all of thirteen months, before the circuit board failed. Eighty buck to replace that on a one hundred dollar blender. Not good value for money.Bottom line, circuit boards don't fail unless they are way too cheap. Kitchen Aid is letting its hard won reputation for quality slip. Sad, honestly."
1,So Very Disappointed,I grew up thinking KitchenAid was an excellent brand. I have never been so disappointed in an appliance. Within a year with moderate use my pitcher is unusable due to a lousy blade assembly.The way it is made makes it impossible buy a replacement unit that might cost $10 at the most and instead requires that I buy a whole new pitcher at close to $50. Not going to happen. The fact that reading other reviews tells me this is very common I would end up buying another pitcher for another $50 in another year. I would rather find a blender that will not cost me $50 a year to use.
1,poor jar design,"The blade mechanism in the jar has a shaft that comes through the bottom of the jar and is held in place by a nut that is reverse threaded. When the blades start spinning, they spin in the opposite direction as the nut tightens causing the nut to come loose and the contents inside of the jar leak on to the base motor unit. Despite trying several times to tighten this nut, the power and the speed of the motor loosen this nut each time. Very poorly designed."
2,Polycarbonate Jar Cracks,"Ordered this unit in April 2007. Have used it to make smoothies since that time. Does a very nice job. However, the container has developed cracks around the base of the jar. Have contacted Kitchen Aid. Dec 21 - Kitchen Aid agreed to replace the container under warranty."
1,Bad carafe,"It didn't take much use to see the bottom of the carafe crack in two places. (Mostly used for smoothies and to blend soups, also minimal ice crushing with liquid.) While it is still usable under certain circumstances, cracks in plastic harbor bacteria and cause a potential for food poisoning. Of course KitchenAid is not willing to replace it after 1 1/2 years and I'm not terribly interested in buying another $60--$70 carafe that is going to break after every 20 smoothies. No more KitchenAid products for me."
2,Blender Carafe Leaks,"I was loving this blender until a couple weeks into owning it and making smoothies daily, I noticed that it was leaking from the bottom of the carafe below the blade. The longer I used it, the worse the leak got until it was virtually pouring out of the bottom of the blender everytime I used it. So I returned it to Amazon and got a replacement. Thinking it was a fluke, I began to use my replacement blender. It is now a couple weeks old and again it is beginning to leak from under the carafe. The motor and everything below the carafe is wonderful, but it appears that there is a design flaw with how the blade is secured to the bottom of the carafe. The nut slowly begins to loosen and with time begins to leak. I would not recommend taking a risk on this model. Looking at the higher priced professional Kitchen Aid model, it appears to have the same carafe and may have the same problem so you may want to try a different manufacturer or research it further before making a purchase."
1,I recommend you DO NOT BUY this item,"I purchased this blender solely on the glowing (""highly recommended"") recommendation by Cooks Illustrated which specifically cited the blender's ice-crushing capabilities as the main reason for it receiving their highest rating. The third time I used it (crushing 8 ordinary ice cubes) the blade assembly broke free from the bottom of the carafe and the carafe leaked profusely. The blade assembly wobbled erratically and I was unable to tighten it in place so I returned it for replacement. ""High Praise"" to Amazon for the speed and simplicity of their return policy. The replacement blender arrived a couple of days later and on the second use it broke in exactly the same manner as the first, this time on only six ice cubes. I returned it for a refund and am now in the market for a new blender, made by anyone other than KitchenAid and recommended by anyone other than Cooks."
4,Kitchenaid blender with plastic pitcher/jar is perfect !,"I purchased this blender because of the the plastic pitcher/jar. The pitcher has a nice wide base - easy to get a spatula into the bottom to empty contents or a cloth when cleaning - easy to handle, not the bulky, heavy jar....PLUS no chipping or breaks like you get with glass pitchers/jars. Nice smooth button panel wipes clean easily. Hopeful the Kitchenaid brand name will assure a long life. I Love it so far."
5,The Rave Reviews are True!,"I got this blender about a year ago. All the rave reviews are true. I love the Cobalt Blue--itlooks beautiful on the counter. This is a powerful blender with a very easy to clean jar. I use it constantly. I have not experienced the problem that a few reviewers have had with the jar cracking and leaking. If I did, I like this blender enough to get a replacement jar, hopefully, KitchenAid has addressed this issue. But so far it's been terrific!"
5,Sweet!,"We had the same issue that many have reported with the polycarb's gasket assembly coming loose, but Kitchenaid replaced it quickly.It works great, it's gorgeous and easy to clean. It's no VitaMix but it is the king of any blender you will find for under $200."
1,KitchenAid NEVER AGAIN!,"I own 4 Pro Line products, including the $300 blender which is very similar to this which they've discontinued. Used about 100 times and the jar started leaking. From the beginning the bearing spit out grease and the blade failed. The replacement began cracking in under a year, used maybe twice per week, often less. Total garbage. KitchenAid Pro toaster for $100. Half the heating elements barely light up, toast barely toasted on highest setting. Pro line coffee grinder, can't even grind without poking the beans into it. I'm done with KitchenAid. They look nice but they don't last and they DO NOT stand behind their products. Avoid them at all costs!"
4,Great for smoothies,"Hi,I bought the Kitchen-aid after reading the Cooks Illustrated review. I've started using it for green smoothies, and it does a great job--liquefies everything in seconds. Everyone always talks about vitamix & blendtec--take a look at the Popular Mechanics blender test video on You Tube and make up your own mind. They test Kitchenaid, Breville, Blendtec, Hamilton Beach & Vitamix. The results might surprise you.[...]"
1,Lasted a year and two weeks,"Was great for a year, now leaks all over the place out of the bottom of the Polycarbonate Jar. Of course the warranty ended two weeks ago!"
1,Don't make the mistake of buying this horrible product!,"After a few months of mild use, this blender started serving up all kinds of problems. It leaked, just a little at first, then the blade mechanism came apart, the thing started smoking, and the contents came spilling out the bottom. Fortunately the blender was covered under KitchenAid's warranty, but getting a replacement through KitchenAid proved to be a big hassle. Looking through the other negative reviews, I see that others have had similar types of problems with this product. Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to those issues before my purchase and was instead drawn by the 4-star average rating; big mistake and lesson learned."
1,Carafe Leaks!,"Though I really wanted to buy a Vita-Mix blender, I couldn't justify the cost. So, I decided to buy the pretty red KitchenAid. I read the reviews that people wrote about the blender leaking at the base of the carafe, but I didn't think it would happen to me. Literally the 1st time that I used it, the blender made this awful loud noise and my smoothie poured out of the base of the carafe. I contacted KitchenAid customer service about the issue and they sent me a brand new carafe - which also leaks! I found out that the issue is that there is a design flaw and the movement of the blender blade actually loosens the blade from the carafe, causing the leak. So now, every time I use my blender, I have to make sure that the blade is super tight in the carafe. Though it always loosens enough that there is some leakage during use, it doesn't pour out of the blender anymore. I'm just saving up for a Vita-Mix, because this KitchenAid blender is awful. I would not recommend it to anyone!"
5,Great Blender,"We've been using this blender on a near daily basis since we got it, usually making smoothies of some sort. I've also used it for chopping/dicing instead of using a knife- it's been a consistently great performer every time. Cleanup is easy, I like the ""Ice Crush"" mode that automatically pulses itself to break up ice pieces before I switch it to puree or liquefy for my smoothies. I bought this blender as cost-effective alternative to a blend-tec or vitamix, and I've been quite satisfied, especially considering it's about 1/4 or 1/5 of the cost! The whole top assembly fits into the dishwasher no problems, though I don't put the rubber lid piece in as it can warp from the heat of the drying cycle. It's a great blender and stands up to frequent use."
1,Another Leaky Review,"I've had this blender for about a year, and I loved it -- until today, when it started leaking from the bottom. I read the review below that said that the carafe has been redesigned and Kitchenaid replaced that reviewer's carafe at no charge despite the fact that it was past the warranty period. So I called Kitchenaid, but I did not have the same experience. The rep I talked to basically told me it was my fault for not pulsing first before blending, and if I want a replacement carafe they will sell me one for $27.99 (30% off the retail price) plus $6.95 s&h."
2,Avoid it if possible,"Like some reviewers described, the connector part that fits the base to the pitcher breaks easily. My friend got me this blender a year ago and I used it occasionally. It stopped working today because of the broken rubber connector when I was making smoothie. It is surprising how this connector part was cheaply made! I am pretty disappointed in Kitchen Aid now..."
5,KitchenAid blender,"I purchased the 5 speed blender from Kitchen Aid - IT ROCKS!!!!!It blends ice, it is fantastic and a great addition to any kitchen!!I recommend it highly."
2,Jar Leaks,We use this rarely (maybe 20 times a year). The jar began to crack and leak after a couple of years. I would not recommend this.
4,Awesome for smoothies/shakes,"I bought this from a b&m store for $20 less than advertised here, after my friend recommended it to me. I wanted a strong blender to make fruit and vegetable smoothies. This does a great job. It is very strong. I love how the jar part is one piece. No more screwing and unscrewing the blade and rubber gasket. It is very easy to clean and use. To clean the manual suggests water and a few drops of dish soap, then turning the blender on. I have been using that method and its very quick and gets it very clean. My smoothies have frozen fruit or ice, plus milk or almond milk, and fruits and veggies. I love how when I turn it on, it has a gentle turn on, and then gets going. It is quite loud though. Thats why I took off 1 star. I try to do it when my toddler isnt in the room, again, bc its so loud. Our dog is also scared of the sound LOL. If you can tolerate the loudness, this is a great blender!"
1,Not dependable at all,"i have had this product for 6m now and for a $100 i expect much more. it leaks, very loud and the bottom screw connected to the blade always needs to be tightener. it's sad bc i wish i would of returned it when one problem started happening but i thought kitchaid has a good name and didn't dare to think anything else would happen.so def i do not recommended this products."
2,Works well but the Polycarbonate jar does get fractures,"I searched around for blenders that could handle grinding ice. I got it in Oct of '09 and mostly used it to blend up smoothies consisting of some watercress and celery with frozen fruit like blueberries, strawberries, bananas or peaches. I should have looked at the jar more often because the warranty was only for a year and after that one has to pay 40 bucks plus shipping for a new one. As it is, it has been not much more than a year since I got the product, they say it is unusual that the jar is having problems, I get concerned about how safe the jar continues to be and they will not replace it now for free. I do like the blender as there are enough settings and the motor is powerful."
1,"Motor broke in the first 30 days, amazon replaced it and now the second one broke",Title says it all. I am back to using my black and decker blender that I have had for years after going through 2 of these in about 3 months. I did see under the warranty that I can get a new one within a year so we will see if the third time is a charm.
5,Excellent blender!,"I purchased this blender in May 2009 and I have nothing but glowing reviews about it. I've mainly been using it for smoothies/shakes, so the ice crushing feature has been put to good use. A lot of the negative reviews of this blender have noted leaking, but I haven't had any problems with this whatsoever. I do hand wash my blender, though (I'm overly cautious, especially since it's made out of plastic), and it sounds like some have had problems after washing in the dishwasher (?). My blender still looks good as new, though - no scratches/cracking/leaks. Very happy with it!"
3,No way to fix the washer,"We more than got our money's worth out of this blender. However just like the bad review it did have a slight leak from the beginning. It blended really well and the motor was powerful. However, eventually the washer just disintegrated and the is leaked A LOT!!. We tried to fix it ourselves and kitchen aid sells a replacement washer, but there is no way to get the parts off to get to the washer.Overall it was a great blender though."
5,Works great,crushes Ice Great. mixes perfect. make a lot of smoothies and mixed drinks and does them all Great. would Buy again easily.
2,Can't Handle Smoothies,"The motor has the amps to grind frozen fruit into smoothies, which is more than you can say for 98% of the consumer blenders out there. But the carafe is not up to the task. The blade assembly fails where it passes through the base, leading to leaks at first and complete failure later. I've been through two carafes in two years (expensive replacement!), and now will have to move on to some other brand.This one will run forever if you're making baby food, but forget it if you grind frozen things."
1,Blender Leaks!! Stay away!,I had this Blender for only 2 weeks when it start leaking. I was making a smoothie. major design flaw. VERY DISSAPOINTED. Stay away!
5,ice crusher,this thing really crushes ice. You can make snow cones in seconds with this thing faster than i can type this! Frozen drinks are great. It's got the power. Had a Hamilton beach before. There's no comparison! Also cool is its made in Ohio. You get what you pay for.
1,Doesn't last.,"We bought this blender because we wanted a good quality blender that could make smoothies, but didn't cost $400.This blender fit the bill, but failed after 6 months."
2,Problems with the Jar-Motor Connection in less than 1 year,"I have enjoyed this blender for about 11 months, but suddenly the blade seized up and the rubber joint between the blade and motor shredded itself. A blender is a simple device that should last almost a lifetime, not less than a year. Both the Jar and the motor part are ruined and from what I can see here, lacking a year old receipt I have no chance of getting a free one. Looks like I'll be looking for a new blender from someone other than KitchenAid"
2,My First KitchenAid Product Disappointment,"This is the first time I've had to write a bad review of a KitchenAid product. When I got this back in 2006 I was disappointed to see that it was plastic, not glass and that the blade didn't separate from the container. But I used it and it was fine until this year when I noticed the plastic container had a crack in it at the base. So disappointed! So evidently the plastic can't hold up to the forces of blending. I've never misused it. I won't be buying another one of these. KitchenAid really needs to keep their focus on making quality products and not go down this road to save money."
3,Vibrates right off the counter,"Got this item for Christmas...I like to make protein shakes after a workout.The blender crushes ice just fine, it has a very strong motor and my protein shakes come out smooth and foamy.The one problem I have with this blender is it vibrates like crazy, if I don't have one hand on it at all timesit will shake right off the counter. Really Kitchen Aid?!? What good is a blender you can't walk away from?So..if you are looking for a blender that is powerful but that you need to baby sit this is the one for you."
2,JAR LEAKS - WIDELY REPORTED ISSUE,"Other consumers have been reporting that the jar is defective. Apparently, this may be true. I've had this blender and loved it for 3 years. Just last week it sprung a leak at the base, by the blade. After looking at other reviews, it appears the jar is faulty and other consumers have gotten it replaced by KitchenAid, free of charge. Of course, I've emailed and called, and they are offering me a 50% discount on the price of a replacement jar, but that's it. I have a really hard time knowing I paid over $120 for this blender and now I can't use it AND they want me to pay for a new one.I am very unhappy that KitchenAid doesn't stand behind it's products, especially when it's their defect to begin with! I won't buy another KitchenAid product after this, and before, I was a true fan."
1,"Now, Lick it Off the Counter","I loved the idea of this blender. Too bad it suffers from blender incontinence! The carafe ""jar assembly"" developed cracks inside that cause it to leak all over the place. I'd think it was just a fluke or that I was some sore of blender idiot, but I see others have had the exact same problem! Grrr... Naturally, I waited too long to complain to KitchenAid, by 2 months...so they don't have to and have no intention of doing anything about this problem. The real issue is that it is OBVIOUSLY an actual design or quality flaw and they're still taking our money by distracting us with what used to be their good name and what is an attractive product, but giving us this garbage in disguise. Grrr...Argggg. Do yourself a favor..find another blender."
1,BLENDER CARAFE LEAKS,"thought i was making a good informed purchase based on the reviews. however, after using blender for about a year the blade mechanism on the bottom became loose and leaks blender juices everywhere. what good is a product if it only lasts as long as the warranty? will not buy kitchen aid products anymore."
1,Great until it leaks,"Loved this blender at first!! Then after daily use making breakfast smoothies, the bottom started to leak. The seal started coming loose. I was able to tighten it but never worked right after that. I was so disappointed! Leaks everywhere from the bottom.. huge bummer!"
1,Leaks on first use...,"After burning my first blender up from repeated use, I was highly disappointed when I bought a second blender only to find the caraffe leaks before its first use. Terrible design flaw as there is no way to tighten the bolt holding the blade. Do not purchase this product, luckily I hadn't tossed the box yet."
5,Wonderful,"This blender is Wonderful... i did my research before buying. i checked which blenders all the cooking magazines recommended, i check consumer reports, and i looked up reviews online. All my research said this was a GREAT blender, and they were right! I LOVE it!"
2,I like my nearly 40-year-old Osterizer better...,"I figured didn't have very long to go in this world, so I purchased this model kitchenaid blender, thinking it would be a stalwart appliance much like my stand mixer. In my opinion, the jar is flimsily designed and does not lock onto the stand. With such a powerful motor, I have to stand there and hold the jar onto the base the whole time while blending. The ""slow-start"" feature is a joke. It does blend well and cleans fairly easily (and we don't have a dishwasher), which is why I gave it two stars. It is also VERY loud. It's going back to the store and until I find another blender, the old 12-speed Osterizer is coming back out of the cabinet."
4,work great - die in about a year,just bought my third kitchen aid 5-speed blender. they work great for about a year then the bottom of the polycarbonate jar falls apart and everything you pour in the top pours out the bottom. both times this happened there was no warning - just one day it fell apart. hmmm. don't really like the plastic jar - glass cleans up better...
1,Not impressed,"It leaks! Makes a horrible mess and is just so-so as a blender, even if you CAN live with the leaks. I used it exactly twice before it started to leak. I tightened it with a wrench, and that lasted for one or two uses. I'm sending it down the garbage chute and looking for something better."
1,love the service hate the product,the first blender we returned now have a second blender and disappointed in how kitchen aid blender is made. I have a kitchen aid mixer and love it but the kitchen aid blender will not hold up. Poorly made. The company was very fast in replacing but would of loved a total refund at this point.
1,lasted 3 months,"This blender is a piece of junk. It lasted 3 months before the plastic gear that makes the blender turn got stripped and now the blender doesn't work anymore. Plus, you can't take the blender apart to clean it so you have to stick your hand down into it and rip up the skin on your fingers trying to get any stuck on food out of it. I had high hopes because the design of the blender jar is way better than the cuisinart's. It did make pouring easier. I am going to try a Waring blender next. I hope it lasts longer."
4,Regarding the jar,FYI the kitchenaid live chat person just said that they are NOT making the jars out of polycarbonate anymore. I gave them the model and serial # and they are sending a free replacement.
2,"Love KitchenAid, but what's with the jar!","I don't know if I got a flawed machine or what, but I've never had trouble before with this blender. But the jar/bowl doesn't fit tight and vibrates something awful. The last one I had was a glass jar. Wondering if that's what makes the difference."
3,"Not bad, but not great","We purchased this blender earlier this year to replace a much cheaper Hamilton Beach blender. Overall, this one wasn't much of an improvement. We had the leaky cup problem reported by the other reviewers, and finally called Kitchenaid to complain. They immediately sent out a new cup, no questions asked. So far, the new cup has not leaked, but everything looks the same as the old one, so I'm not sure why the other one leaked and this one does not.We primarily use this blender for fruit smoothies, and the performance has been somewhat disappointing. The motor has plenty of power, but we have to frequently stop the blender to push down the frozen ingredients into the path of the blade."
1,Would be fantastic,"Husband and I got this for our wedding. I was thrilled to make about eight smoothies, slushies and even ice cream.Husband went to crush some ice, as it is one of the features. With the ice, he happened to add drink mix. While blending, sticky ice slosh spewed out of the bottom.Every time I've used it since the leak escalated. I see a lot of similar complaints.This wasn't from mal-use; it was only on it's ninth cycle. If part of the design was to crush ice, then in no part should my husband be at fault for using like it was designed.Meh. I really wanted a smoothie today too."
2,Be ready to test the warranty coverage.,Bought this blender for my wife in Dec. 2008. First impression was that it was really loud for such a supposedly well made appliance. She liked it and used it maybe 3 times a month for about 8 months. Then the blade assembly stripped out in the bottom of the plastic pitcher. By the time I got around to calling about the warranty the 1 year had elapsed. I was in no hurry cause I thought they had a lifetime warranty and we were using our old cheap one. So I tried to find a replacement part but seems the only solution is to buy a whole new pitcher which I'm not about to do after seeing how many people are having the same problem as I am.This blender seems to have a major design flaw that KitchenAid will not correct.
4,Very good blender but I wouldn't follow dishwasher instructions.,"I am really happy with the solid construction and working of this blender and would purchase it again if given the choice. I would not, however, believe the dishwasher safe instructions. It may be ""safe"" to put the lid on the top rack but now mine is warped and took on a redish color from some spaghetti sauce it was in with. We are now hand washing to whole thing."
5,Great so far.,"I bought my KSB560ER locally on sale for about $20 less than the going rate (Purchased February 2013) to replace a 40 oz Osterizer which leaked, made unhappy noises and occasional burning smells. Absolutely love it so far. Plenty of power and heft. Love the large, easy to clean jar. Handles hot soups as well as frozen drinks. Turns ice cubes into a snowy powder in seconds without any scary noises or burning odors!I like the electronic motor controls, and expect that feature should protect the motor against overloading and overheating.If I have problems in the future, I'll try to update the review."
2,disappointed,"very disappointed - it can only handle things I could almost mix by hand. Very difficult to make a smoothie - the sole reason I purchased it. When I put frozen fruit in it gets clogged immediately. This happens even if I defrost the fruit first. And then, if I add protein powder and milk it just gets worse."
5,Best icebreaker ever!!!,I usually buy cheap blenders from low end department stores. I am so glad I went with this blender. It crushes ice like it was nothing. The base is heavy duty enough that it does not feel like the unit is going to come apart if you fill the jar up to the top with fruity goodness!!! I love this blender!!!
1,"I've tried several blenders, simplify your search and buy a Vitamix.",for a wonderful blender simplify your life and go with a Vitamix--one of the best products still made in our USA.
1,Expensive doesn't always mean good.,"I bought the red version in November. Today I decided to try it out the first time. I got my yoplait berry mix and the milk. Put it into the jar, plugged the blender in. And IT DOESN'T WORK!How about that? A $100 blender from a supposed top brand seller and the unit comes DOA? What kind of quality control allows a non-working unit to ship out?I called Kithchen Aid, the lady was nice. She said she's sending a replacement but not to expect it in about 2-4 weeks! My freaking goodness! So what will I do with the berry mix and milk in the jar now? Once the new unit arrives, I plan on sending it back to Kitchen Aid with the berry mix and the rotten milk.Thanks KA, just ruined my day!"
3,KitchenAid Blender KSB5600B,"KitchenAid KSB560OB 5-Speed 56-Ounce Blender: works okay so far (used once or twice since 12/25/10). But the plastic bowl is disappointing for a KitchenAid product - especially the plastic drive gear. Don't expect this one to last for very many uses, especially for tough jobs like crushing ice ..."
4,great blender,"got this for my parents: my father has problems with solid food, and Cooks Illustrated rateed this one quite well. My parents agree, very satisfied with its performance (not quite as good as my Vitamix, but good enough for their purposes)"
3,kitchen aid ideas,"the kitchen aid 'blender' works ok but the 'jar' isn't big enough and the lid/glass insert leaks. filling the jar about 1/4-1/3 full will allow use of the 'liquify' speed without overflow. the glass insert leaks and the design, plus the rubber lid facilitates the leaks. an option is to seal the insert to the lid but this is a permanent move. the jar needs to be 12-18 oz larger for proper use. speeds 4-5 cannot be used if jar is over 1/2 full.overall, the blender is acceptable. there is a larger blender on the market but more expensive and subject to failure.I knew the jar was smaller than desired but it was the largest I could find reasonably."
4,Fine product,"Biggest issue I have had with blenders in the past is frozen drinks. I like them very icy and most blenders are unable to keep blending because the ice is too solid. I thought the shape of this blender's container and the position of the blades would make it work better. And it does slightly better job, but my opinion is no traditional blender can do a great job on icy drinks.Overall the blender is a quality product and good design, cleanup is easy. However, they don't recommend throwing it in the dishwasher every time, so only time will tell if it holds up for me."
5,Blender,"By far the best blender I have owned. From Smoothies to Margaritas, perfect mixing each time."
1,Do not buy,I bought this blender with high hopes but ended up returning it the same day. The plastic gear on the bottom of the jar and the top of the motor shredded the first time I used the blender. I will stick with the Oster Beehive blender since I have always had good luck with that one.
3,Worked for the easy stuff...,"This was good for a couple of years, although it definitely leaked a few times. I tried to make peanut butter in it - I wouldn't recommend it; it caught on fire!"
5,Great Blender,"I've owned quite a few blenders over the years, the last one was a top brand that was terrible. If you struggle with blenders where the carafe comes apart when you are using it, or if you have to assemble it just so to get it to work, then this is the blender for you. The design is far superior to the traditional blender.As for performance, it makes quick work of frozen fruit for smoothies, and quickly makes a vortex out of the thickest liquids. I purchased this blender after a favorable review in Cook's Illustrated, and only wish I'd bought it sooner."
1,Will NOT Last!!,"The motor/base is great except for how the base fits to the pitcher...faulty design. Regardless of what is blended, regular use will cause the pitcher to crack. I only use it for protein shakes... no ice. I've had mine replaced twice and a third is on the way. Its out of warranty now and they will not replace again. It looks great and would last forever except for this. They should reinforce the pitcher design and supply owners with one that is not flawed.I have a Kithchenaid coffee grinder that isn't but a few years old that lost a nut off the motor shaft. They already no longer have that part, but, they were nice enough to offer me a newer model at a ""discount"".I've not had much luck with Kitchenaid. Very disappointing."
1,Doesn't last,"I'm willing to bet that all the five start reviews come from people who just got the blender. And the one star reviews were written by people who've been using it for awhile, like me.First off--it's NOISY!! Deafening, really. But worse than that, the gear and cog that fit together at the bottom are BOTH made of PLASTIC!! It doesn't take long for them to grind each other down and for the smell of burning plastic to permeate the house. Eventually, both gear and cog are ground down to the point that one turns and the other doesn't. I'm at that point now. So, I'm shopping for a new blender."
2,weak!,The blender seemed good at first but the washer broke on it ~10-20 uses in. We were only using it to make fruit smoothies and always had liquid in with the frozen fruit. There doesn't seem to be a way to fix or replace it so now we are back on the market looking for a new blender.
2,"Strong motor, terrible blade","Had I to do it over again, I would not have purchased this blender. The blade is not sharp, which, although stronger, does not blend your items until they are smooth. Rather, it simply pulverizes them, but always leaves large bits un-blended. Smoothies are not smooth, and ice either remains too large or turns to water. I'd recommend spending the extra money and purchasing a Waring."
1,Leaks!,I only had it for a week and it started leaking where the blade attaches. My husband tried to tighten it but there is no way. Apparently I'm not the only one with that problem. Not worth exchanging for a new one so I'm going to have to find another brand. Any suggestions?
2,Disappointed in the brand,"I've had my KitchenAid blender for several years but didn't use it much until about six months ago when I started preparing my own hummus. No big jobs like ice crushing- just pureeing beans and occasionally pulsing tomatoes to for salsa. There are six ""teeth"" housed on the top of the blender unit that grip the underside of the jar and propel the blade mechanism. Two weeks ago, I noticed that all but two of those teeth had broken off. The two remaining broke off during my last attempt at hummus. Now the blade will not spin and I'm in the market for a new blender. If it weren't for the fact that I have a crappy, albeit quite beautiful, stainless steel drum KitchenAid dishwasher that I paid a mint for, I'd probably be purchasing another blender from this manufacturer. Sadly, I've lost faith in brand I once held in very high regard. I think I'm going with the Oster Classic Beehive."
1,Returned it,"After first use a piece of black plastic was found floating in the blender. Thankfully I was just rinsing the jar with water so I saw it. I was still going to keep the blender, but the next time I used it what looked like grease was found streaked on the bottom of the jar. I don't know whether or not it was inside the jar also. Regardless I didn't feel comfortable and dumped my smoothie and returned the blender."
1,Started Having Trouble Within A Month Or So,"I rate this item with one star because for what I wanted it was not up to par. You do get what you pay for.But I wanted to let someone who might be in my shoes know: It's not made for frozen fruit smoothies or any sort of drink using ice. Mine started leaking after the 7th or 8th use, and later the teeth of the bottom part of the metal blade ate away enough of the plastic gasket that turns to grind that it just fell to pieces.If it's iced smoothies you want my advice is to save your pennies for a real, solid, quality blender. This is what I'm going to do. I hope this helps!"
1,Plastic teeth shedded on base and jar,"We bought this at Sears and used this blender about ten times; the gears ground themselves to bits, under a load of ice cream and milk, about half full. Pathetic. The gear on the base and also on the jar were completely ruined. Sears was great about taking it back, I just feel bad for whoever buys this thing after its refurbished."
1,Bad piece? Careful.,"i bought this blender new in October from amazon.com. it is totally awesome.however a few weeks later the blades inside the jar just broke. snapped in two. i was just simply blending some fruit to get my fiber intake. and no, there were no seeds. and nothing halfway solid. weird.my husband called kitchenaid directly and they shipped us a replacement product which we received in 9 days. great service. we are now using the new blender. it is working well BUT it even sounds different than the one that died.when we received the box from amazon.com i did not even get an instruction book. i was asking my daughter's nanny for recipe ideas and she asked me why i was not looking in the book. i told her we did not get a book. again, weird."
3,Mighty Mouse has a short life.,"The Iogear GME227RW6 germ-free wireless laser mouse works great and has great response movement. However, it has an extremely short battery life and is too small for a comfortable hand fit. I was surprised to find out (after I received it) that it is a notebook mouse rather than a desktop mouse."
2,Terrible Battery Life,"Don't purchase this mouse unless you're prepared to put two new AAA batteries in it about once a month.The cost of batteries soon outweight the cost of the mouse and I stated thinking if they are a part of Duracel.A+ for design and responsiveness though, but what's the point?"
5,Music that makes you bounce,"When I 1st saw this item I didn't believe it, as I had seen it a few yrs back for over $50 as an import. Really glad I didn't get it back then. The CD contained all of Missy's hits at a fraction of the cost."
3,Pretty Good,"The beats on this album are great, I guess I was expecting more. Of all the 16 or so songs, I like half of them quite a bit. It's a good CD to keep you going on road trips."
5,incredible workout music,Turn down that CHEESY music on your exercise DVD and make your OWN mix. Even if the beats per minute are off after a while you can STILL GET INTO IT (in your own home you can do it your way you know)!
5,Great feel and a good product.,"I received the product four days after ordering it, which was great. I had been expecting at least a week for delivery, so it was awesome to get it so quickly. I purchased it for a pendant I had, the original cord for which had recently snapped. The old cord had been a cheap rubber cord, so I was looking for something a little more sturdy. I wasn't disappointed, and the material used for the new cord seems to be of very high quality, and it should last a long time.The only complaint I have is that the extension twists up easily, but it's really not much of a problem."
1,Shallow and Pointless,"This book was stupid. It had no point! Twist of Fate was okay but this book was totally unnecessary! It doesn't even have avoid beginning. I read this book in 15 minutes in the dictor's office I read the first chapter and skimmed through the rest. One reviewer said it best romance readers are intelligent. If she didn't want Philip as her doctor all she had to do since she was a 28 year old woman, was refuse treatment and then check herself out if the hospital. How could Ms. Clark think that we wouldn't know that or that Lily didn't really need to stay at Magnolia Grove.Ms. Clark dedicated Beyond the Rapture to her loyal fans who passionately urged her to write a sequel to Twist of Fate but I get the feeling that she really didn't want to write this book and just put something together. Like throwing a bone to a dog! Why would she write something some shallow and pointless?"
3,Sequel was ok....,"I really liked ""A Twist of Fate"" but ""Beyond the Rapture"" was a little disappointing. I did not like Lily at all. She was such a spoiled princess and thought that the world revolved around her. She was not a likeable heroine. I still have the book which means it wasn't a total waste, but it definitely wasn't as good as its predecessor."
5,Yoruba Legends (Forgotten Books),"An excellent book of folk tales and parables from the Yoruba tradition. Stories are short enough for bedtime with youngsters. Several are quite humorous, more provide insight into Yoruba values."
5,In The Name Of Love is excellent!!,"This was a good novel about Dr. Shari Thomas and businessman Derrick Rawlings who breakup after dating in college. Shari moves on with her life, then years later, Derrick returns to town to run the family business. Derrick discovers they have a son together and proposes mariage. I believe Shari was still in love with him but not sure if Derrick was proposing to get his hands on his son or because he's still in love with her. Then there was Mia Dallas, Derrick's ex-girlfiend, she definitely made her presence known with a nasty proposal of her own. This book was off the hook. It was well written and kept me reading page after page. Readers who have read Ms. Sammie's work know what I'm talking about. I'm looking forward to her next release."
5,"Enjoyed Both Books, Sammie","Sammie, I really enjoyed both books, In The Name Of Love and Love To Behold. I could have read and read more, you are a wonderful and blessed writer."
5,Dark and breathtaking,"This is Gloria Coates' finest CD release so far. For those not familiar with her work, her music is dark and engaging. Though primarily tonal, her music can venture into regions of nearly apocalyptic gloom. It is distinctly modern and profoundly intriguing. This is the musical equivalent of reading Poe. The macabre aspects of it are by no means off-putting but evocative and thought provoking. These symphonies are spectral, mist enshrouded and dusky. If you like music along the lines of Crumb's Haunted Landscape with dense and richly developed orchestration like Maxwell Davies, this is for you.Caution: you may find Gloria Coates' music irresistable. Should that be the case her Symphony No. 2 also appears on CPO. There are also a set of Quartets on Naxos. Though the quartets are more along the lines of Tavener or Part, they retain the same appealingly haunted quality."
4,Scotland Royal Banner,"Excellent colors- the last one I ordered from this place lasted 6 months, began to fade- but the price is right.Long lasting fabric"
3,Good value,"Emblems aren't horribly detailed, and based on the construction, I wouldn't hang this outside for very long, but if you need a wallhanging that will get you amped for the next highland games, this is a pretty cost-effective way to do it."
4,Great for the price!!,Basic polyester flag -- should hold up in the wind -- no problems with it. Nice grommets. Good value for money.
4,Beulah Show,"Video quality could have been better, because it looks as if these shows were not made from the masters, or, perhaps, we have the best quality available.A wonderful era in which people did not judge everything from a politically correct point of view.Although hokey, it is the 'hokeyness' of the show that I wanted to remember.Next, Walt Disney Company needs to release 'Song of the South'...another wonderful period piece which remains hidden due to political correctness."
1,Filthy language in this book! Not for kids!!,"My husband and I bought this book for our son's eleventh birthday. He loves baseball and especially the Red Sox. We read the reviews and found nothing objectionable written there. We paid for gift wrap so therefore didn't have a chance to read the book before his birthday. Luckily, in the excitement of his birthday, the book got laid to the side until we got a chance to preview it. Imagine our shock to find a chapter with the ""F"" word in the title!! Not to mention the DOZENS of other expletives in the book including the ""f"" and ""n"" words. I took a black sharpie to the book thinking surely it must just be a few bad words in this book. I am only halfway through and have already marked through dozens of words. The book will barely be readable by the time I am through. It will most likely just end up in the trash where it belongs. Do not buy this book for a child or anyone that doesn't care for filthy language!"
4,Very sexy and fun!,"This product was great. It smells and tastes wonderful and doesn't leave any sort of weird residue, so it's comfortable to wear. It also adds a lot of fun to the bedroom. ;)"
5,What a hit!,"Im in love with this Perfume. It's has a magnificient scent. Not overly sweet smelling a mild cotton candy scent. But the taste is awesome. I have my boyfriend going nuts. It has a hint of oil which I was nevervous about due to senitive skin, but had no probloms. The only problom is I cant find it in stores. First purchase was at Walmart. I finally gave up and am glad I found it here, To all women a very tasty and flirty product. If you like your neck kissed its a must have!Taste by Jessica Simpson 50ml 1.7oz EDT Sprayyou have to get it"
3,Perfume,"I LOVE the way this perfume smells, but it seems to wear off VERY quickly. I wish it lasted longer, because I would definitely buy more as it would be my new favorite fragrance."
1,Yuck,"I was looking for something light and more on the non-toxic side. I figured since it could be edible, then this would work. I found it overly vanilla and made my skin sticky all day long."
5,New York Gem,"This album is an absolute gem. All of the songs are either literally about New York, or are sung in the context of New York by these wonderful New Yorkers from all walks of life. There is an amazing CD booklet with great photos of New York and stories about each of the songs. I've never seen such a beautiful booklet - you absolutely must read it while you listen to the album for the first time - it is truly a moving experience - and if you are a New Yorker, as I am, or if you just love New York you won't be disappointed. I especially love Tony Ermilio's take on ""New York, New York""."
4,loved it!,This recording is great because it showcases real people in a city that is really the greatest city in the world! I knew all the songs and it was great to hear the connections between the lyrics and the people and places that make up New York. I've never seen a booklet like this one in any CD! Great graphics and text! Good job!
1,Bangers,"David Olere told Auschwitz expert Jean-Claude Pressac in 1981 that the Nazis made sausages out of Jews.Olere was as bad a liar as he was an artist.Several of the drawings, along with their captions in this book could only be described as pornographic. He seems obsessed with male sexual domination, and his pictures say much more about his psychology than they do about Birkenau. Several pictures of German officers taking advantage of Jewish girls, and even their mothers, is something he could hardly have witnessed, and if it did occur the Germans would have broken the Nuremberg Law which forbade sex between Jews and Germans.Badly drawn nonsense from a pervert."
1,"Please no, oh please no","Resist any and all temptation to buy these speakers. They sound horrible. They can suck up major amperage to produce weak sound. Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY!"
4,Land of the Giants,This show somehow manages to hold up. Yes the FX seem cheesey by todays standards but no more then any Lost in Space episode would. I do hope they release these seasons seperatly so that not everyone has to shell out the big cash for the complete collectors edition. With that said I will admit that the big package here was well worth it to me. I remember this show but I was around 2 when it was on the air. i do rememebr seeing repeats later on but I did not get to see this show when it aired on prime time. I would suggest tring ebay though because you will have a good chance of gettting the collectors edition for under 1oo bucks. I got mine for around 87 dollars and that included shipping.
1,Way too much money,They have priced themselves out of my price range. I'm going to rent it from Netflix.
1,This Price Worries Me!,"I agree with the latest review re the high price. I want to purchase this series very much, but cannot afford to do so due to the ""astronomical"" price. By the time I do have the money, I worry that there will be no more copies available. This is also the problem with lesser know sci fi movies and other old TV series from when I was a child. It is bad enough that current popular series prices for CSI, all the Law & Order versions, etc. are fairly high. When my disabled, teen son requested a copy of the second season of 7th Heaven, the store wanted over $50! I am also a single, disabled mom--short on an entertainment budget, so I'm concerned that large price tag items such as these may spoil the market to enthusiastic viewers--not heavy duty collectors."
1,GIANT PRICE,"ONE STAR IS FOR THE PRICE,NOT THE PRODUCT. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOUR YEARS FOR 20TH CENTURY FOX TO RELEASE THE TWO SEASONS OF THIS GREAT SHOW INDIVIDUALLY BUT NOTHING YET. I REFUSE TO PAY THE RIDICULOUS PRICE OF THIS SET,LIMITED ED. OR NOT. USUALLY SELLS FOR $180+ AND EVEN NOW ON SALE IT'S OVER $130. DOES ANYBODY OUT THERE HAVE ANY INFO ABOUT A POSSIBLE RELEASE OF THE TWO SEASONS AT A REASONABLE PRICE?"
2,"Product Details, Not Nine-Discs Set","Land Of The Giants is an awesome show, the problem I have is with the product the product details info, said there are nine discs (9)in this collection, but there is only five (5) discs. There is four (4) two-sided discs and one (1) single disc in this collection. I rate the show at five (5) stars and rate the product at two (2) stars. I have an lot of problems with two-sided discs in the past and I will not buy them any more."
1,I'm not going to buy it either,"Yes, this place is for reviews about the product but with this price nobody is gonna buy it. And then they are going to say no more future releases because of poor sales. With these prices!!!!! Remember what happened to Mary Tyler Moore show......it costed almost 54$ aprox, after poor sales and thousands of fan mails they dropped the price to 24$ and second season came to light.So I love this show but I'm not gonna pay almost 200$ for it. Ok, it's a Limited Edition but it's also a robbery!!!!!!"
3,Giant Dissapointment,"This was a favorite show when I was a youngster. That was 40 years ago. The cost of the dvd set caused me to hold off buying for a long time. Once I received the set it was a giant dissapointment. I realized I had grown up. The scripts and characters in the show are one dimensional. It's redeaming qualities are the sets, props,special effects,costume design and lighting. These redeeming qualities (along with a beautiful digital transfer)keep the intrest for each hour long episode. The amount of time and money put into building giant telephones, pencils and other props is worthy of viewing. You can see the smallest of details in all these props. The mattes used to bring the giants and little people together are also very well thought out and bring realism to the show. However, with this said, the price (even with the added fruitless tidbits of accessories)is not worth the value the producers of this dvd set are asking."
1,"LAND OF ""GARBAGE"" ON DVD.","ANYONE WHO IS DRUNK ENOUGH TO PLUNK DOWN ANYTHING OVER 14.99$ FOR THIS GARBAGE ON DVD IS EITHER 6 YRS. OLD OR AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. THIS DRIVEL IS SOO BAD IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN MADE IN SOME HILL BILLIES BACKYARD IN EDISON,N.J. HOW CAN ANYONE CALL THIS STUPID,RETARTED,BORING RIP OFF OF LOST IN SPACE A REAL SHOW? THE ACTRESS LOOKS LIKE A JERSEY CITY STREETWALKER AND ASIDE FROM THE FAT KID--NONE OF THE LEADING MEN APPEAR STRAIGHT. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU REMEMBER--ITS WORSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT BUY IT! I TRYED TO RE-SELL IT AND THE GUY BEHIND THE COUNTER JUST LAUGHED AT ME!!! LAND OF THE GIANT IDIOTS! WORST SHOW EVER!!!!! BUY THE LUNCHBOX AND HIT YOURSELF OVER THE HEAD WITH IT!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY--"" HELLO LARRY"" COMES OUT IN 6 DAYS --IF YOU REALLY WANT TO PEE YOUR SSI CHECK AWAY.NOW GO MAKE YOUR WIFE MOW THE LAWN. LETS BE HONEST--ITS WORTHLESS TV."
1,It's down to $115.49! Aren't you sorry you didn't wait!,"FOX AND/OR AMAZON IS PLAYING GAMES! FIRST $150 THEN $180 THEN $170 THEN $200.00 NOW $115.49! WHAT'S GOING ON ????? IF YOU GOT IT FOR $200 AND ARE NOW SEEING IT AT $115, I'D REALLY BE PISSED! GETTING MORE REASONABLE, BUT STILL PRICEY. HAVE A LOWER PRICED EDITION (about 70% to 80% lower) WITHOUT THE REPRODUCTION JUNK INCLUDED."
1,Overpriced for a Cult Following,Yep - the price on this set is ridiculous! I loved this show as a kid and have waited and waited for it to come to dvd. NOT AT THIS PRICE!!! Pick it up on i-Tunes for $78.00!! Gosh!
2,Defective Disc #1,"Since the price dropped to $115, I ordered this set which I have desired for a very long time. It arrived fine, but on Disc #1 in the episode entitled ""The Crash"" at time interval 48:53, the screen pixelates and the disc freezes and stops playing altogether. I returned it promptly and when my replacement arrived, the same defect was present. When I requested yet another replacement, Amazon's response was ""I'm sorry to hear the replacement item had the same problem as your first order. This usually doesn't happen. Since it's likely another replacement would arrive defective, I won't trouble you with another order. Please return the item for a full refund. We do need you to return the entire set. We'll pay for the return shipping costs.""While I appreciate a full refund, I really would like to purchase this set. Is anybody else experiencing the same defect as described above?"
3,Wait until it is under $100,"Loved the show as a kid, still think it is fun today. My kids seem to enjoy it too. I'm not going to be critical of the show.However, this package disappoints. It is far less than I expected. The box is cool. And the way the DVDs are stored inside is cool too. The extras were worth about $5. And the most disappointing thing was that the DVD folders were all seriously warped in the box when I got it. It seemed that the package I received had been stored in an unacceptably hot area for some prolonged period of time. I don't know how the disks themselves escaped damage, though there was some minor scarring on a few. And I haven't been able to find suitable replacement disk folders either.This is worth some extra than a basic set of the whole series alone would be, but not what I paid. Wait until it is under $100 or they release just the series at a more reasonable price.Clint"
2,Unbox,"I downloaded many of these using Amazon's Unbox. I cannot understand why anyone would pay such a price. Face it, Lost in Space, Voyage and even Time Tunnel were better series'."
2,Someone at Fox is smokin' crack...,"Maybe $179 a pop for Land of the Giants on DVD is to help pay for someone's drug habit at Fox - that's the only reason that make sense as to why they would charge so d*mn much! The first season was the best one...and it went down hill from there! I have all seasons of Lost in Space, which was way better than Land of the Giants, and I'm pretty frickin' sure I didn't pay $180 for them! C'mon, man...."
1,"Review for the package, not the series","Since I view these reviews as being based on the package, not the film or TV series, I have no problem giving 1 star to a complete rip-off. And I faithfully watched the series as a boy, but no way will I spend this much money for it."
2,Limited Edition???,"Is this is a limited edition? if so then when will it run to its limit? If this is a limited release? then so is every other DVD box set that is still for sale. All I want is the DVD's and possibly a little booklet, I don't really want a Giant box full of very expensive air. Come on release something serious that people with normal budgets can afford & want. If this limited edition is still for sale they either made so many of them that it isn't linmited at all or they just arn't selling! I would only buy this if the price came down to below $40, then I would probablly throw most of it away so it can fit in my DVD shelves."
1,Are you Kidding Me,"I thought $149 was way too high but now $179, heck I'll just wait for the HD DVD set for $99 a year from now, heck got Get Smart for 5 seasons was only $199 and that was a bit to high also."
1,way too expensive,I hate giving a review of one star but the asking price for this series is ridiculously high. I give the show itself 5 STARS.
3,On thin ice,"I have used this product for years since I have a severe headache syndrome that has me apply the ice packs throughout the day. This natural remedy is in the place of many meds that I've taken over the years that make me ill. In the past, I have purchased them directly from the manufacturer. This time, upon receiving them, the dramatic lack of material in the pads was noticeable. They are about half as thick as they used to be and thus, their effect for my headaches is reduced proportionately. I have to use two pads for the results that I used to have from one. If this continues with my next order, I will complain to them directly and possibly try to find another source of pain relief, even though in the past I've not had much success. They used to sell this product at my local Wal-Mart. Sorry that is not the case but it doesn't matter who sells it if its quality suffers as much as it has of late."
2,Not flexible,"I bought two of these (the largest size available, and this size). They have no flexibility out of the freezer. If you leave it sitting out on the counter for awhile, it slowly becomes flexible, but I was hoping for something I could use right away. I'll keep the smaller one (I can sort of let it thaw or beat on it til it breaks up a bit, and I guess if nothing else I can use it in an insulated grocery bag), but the larger one is going back. They do stay cold for a long time."
1,Mismatched ??,"I bought this from the Amazon website from AmericaRX. The gel pack appeared too wide to fit in the cloth sleeve. I was not able to stuff it inside. When I wrote AmericaRX about it, they told me to contact the manufacturer because they sent me what was sent to them. Excuse me,the seller should handle it. This isn't a high tech item, if that matters. I told them that, then they wanted me to take pictures and send the photos to them. If the item isn't right, or even if the customer just thinks it is not right, it should be a no-brain ""send it back for an exchange or refund"". This AmericaRX outfit isn't someone you want to do business with. Kind of like buying from e-bay. I didn't see a ""all sales final, no refunds without photographic proof"" disclaimer.I have used a similar product with success in the past, but the copy I got was unsatisfactory and so was the seller."
2,Not So Hot,"I've only used the Therapy Pad in 'heated' mode thus far. It heats up quickly and seems to stay warm for a good long while. The reason for the not-so-hot review is due to a design flaw. The fastener on the sleeve of the Pad is a velcro patch - a patch that is wider than it should be or needs to be. The velcro manages to overlap the Pad sleeve at the edges. As long the velcro isn't touching any sensitive skin, you're OK. I don't mind handling velcro with my fingers, but it's rather different to have any part of a velcro patch resting against your bare neck for 15 - 20 minutes. Long story short, since there's no practical way to trim the velcro patch to eliminate the problem, you may need to buffer the area being treated with your shirt collar or a handkerchief."
2,Just okay,"The concept is good the outer band works great, but the pack becomes totally hard in freezer, so keep it in fridge, was disappointed about this because there are many gel products that do freeze and stay flexible."
4,fits well,This fits well and is somewhat helpful with a migraine. Because it lays flat it does not take up much room in the freezer and it remains flexible.
5,Great stuff,"Catonsville chronicles through photographs the story of a great American suburb. Residents of the town will certainly enjoy it, but more broadly anyone interested in how a small town grows and transforms into a bustling suburb will find it fascinating. Well laid out and thorougly documented. Great stuff."
5,A must-have...,"This is a must-have book for anyone who grew up in the Catonsville area of Baltimore County, MD. Item everything it was purported to be, and delivery was very prompt - you can't do any better than that!"
2,"Frishberg 'Retromania"" disappointing","I was disappointed in my Frishberg ""Retromania"" It was recorded live in a public setting, I presume not too large. The piano mike was too hot and came out much louder than the voice, which was what I really wanted. The lyrics to those songs are so clever, but are obliterated in places by the piano. I am a piano fan, but not to that extent."
5,Angelo Brothers 1 light wall vanity lights,"Really nice, I'm so pleased with them. I didn't care for the shade, however, too much of a dust collector, so I used the shade from the ones I replaced with the old ones I took down.I give them a high rating."
4,Der Liebhaber Damon: Ein verfuehrerischer Satyr,"Die Oper ""Der Liebhaber Damon oder die Satyrn in Arkadien"" (1724) von Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767)ist eine lustige Geschichte. Diese Oper geht um den Hirt Laurindo`s Liebeskummer und die Triebe von dem Satyr Damon nach die Frauen und wie am Ende er wird gestraft von dem Volk und wird nicht Teilnehmer der Ausbildung seines Sohnes. Es gibt viele schoene Arien, zum Beispiel ""Ich entflamme mit den Blicken"", wo Damon (Michael Schopper)singt ueber seine Triebe nach die Frauen. Michael Schopper hat eine wunderschoene Stimme und in dieser Arie singt auf eine verfuehrerische Weise. Andere schoene Arie ist ""Hat dir mein Herz dein Herz entrissen"", wo Damon beweist eine empfindsame Herz auch zu haben; aber mein lieblingste Arie von dieser Oper ist ""Brich nicht mein Herz, geliebte Schoene"", die ist sehr romantisch. Ich empfehle diese Oper zu kaufen, die ist sehr lustig und hat viele schoene Arien!"
4,Love historical novels. This was a good one.,"This story of the American Revolution was written in the vernacular of the time, with ""no holes barred"" regarding the language and behavior of the time. I didn't realize how bawdy the people of the time really were or how unkind to those around them. At the same time, the courage and loyalty of the patriots was remarkable. Ms. Robson spent a lot of time and effort researching for this novel. The characters are copied from real characters of the time. I must admit I had some time reading the novel, as I had to think about what the author or character really in today's language by the statements that were presented. I loved the feeling of actually living in the time through Ms. Robson's words. I have been to a lecture of hers and was very impressed by her honest knowledge. Good reading!"
4,I really like this duster!!,I like this duster. It picks up dust very well. And when it gets dirty I throw it away and put on a new one.
5,A favorite--year after year,"Our daughter was about 5 when she first discovered Orly's Draw-A-Story. Five years later, it's still her hands-down favorite. Even though she's heard the stories over and over, she illustrates them differently each time. The software encouraged her to write and illustrate her own story, as well.She doesn't like win/lose type games, so this software particularly appeals to her.If you want truly creative software, this is the best out there. I've looked for similar software and I haven't found anything like it."
1,Out of date,This is wonderful program but it's out of date. This program is made for win95. I hope that it gets an upgrade.
1,Too Outdated to Work!,"This game sounded great, and I was excited for my son (5) to try it out, but it was too outdated to work on my Mac. I couldn't seen anything about the system requirements on Amazon- but it doesn't even work in Classic mode (Mac os 9). My only option is to pick up a first run emac. Too Bad!"
1,who knows,after trying to use this software on 3 different computers I gave up. It never ran on any of them.
2,Mediocre,"I just didn't like the book--maybe if it had been formatted better, this might have made a difference...Norma"
4,Atmospheric and Very Effective,"Celtic Moods is part of Virgin's very successful and highly entertaining ""Moods"" series of CD's. This one is the most different of the bunch, combining both more contemporary, ""New-Age"" celtic compositions like Clannad's famous ""Theme from 'Harry's Game'"" with more traditional pieces. Every song is a keeper. Carter Burwell (who wrote the brilliant music for ""Fargo"") has two wonderful songs at the start of the disc that set the mood perfectly. Other than the Clannad track, you probably haven't heard much of the rest of these songs before, but after hearing ""Sleepy Maggie,"" ""Heroine,"" and ""Woodbrook,"" you won't forget them. Unlike so many compilations that attempt to capture the unique sound and seductive appeal of Celtic music with unsatisfying B-grade music, this one succeeds. It's a keeper."
3,Another Perspective,"I have to hand it to the people who compile these CD's for keeping this one real. It is an unfortunate thing that ""Celtic"" culture has become associated with the New Age movement. Unfortunate because so often what is referred to as Celtic sometimes is so in name only, not to mention the fact that I can't tell people about my passion for it without getting some who roll their eyes. I am pleased to say though that aside from the packaging this is a collection that passes muster as it contains artists who are no less than the genuine article. Granted, Loreena McKennit is Canadian, but she has proven a strong dedication to the genre and when coupled with the likes of Paul Brady, well, let's just say his is a tide which lifts all boats. I recommend this along with any of the Celtic Twilight series as good introductions to this style of music."
2,warning:,"This CD is NOT by the same band as ""the Mob"" who wrote ""let the tribe increase"" despite the organization on this website."
5,Required Reading,"I teach Environmental Law in a masters environmental science program. Weart's book is required reading in my class. I have given numerous copies to friends and relatives most of whom, unfortunately, do not know the first thing about science. This is a must read book. I'm looking forward to a third edition."
5,Well written,I found the book well written and useful in understanding the facts about the history and current scientific reasoning regarding climate change. If you are interested in the subject this is a must read.
5,How scientists confirmed global warming,"Drawing from scientific discoveries in oceanography, meteorology, geochemistry, biology and astrophysics, author Spencer R. Weart draws you into the puzzle of climate change as it is unfolding through time. No one person had an ""aha"" moment and discovered global warming. Instead, today's understanding required an accumulation of theories from disparate areas of research, shaped by the rigors of the scientific method. These discoveries convinced most scientists that global warming is a serious phenomenon. Weart outlines the scientific process that led to today's climate diagnosis. He also relates lively stories about the people behind the discoveries. That may not be as immediately applicable, but getAbstract finds that it is illuminating and could help readers feel like insiders in this fight."
1,"Disappointing result for this ""once only"" access to Link!","I suppose one has to weigh up between having an actual video of this much underrated genius of the guitar as being a real bonus, and the disappointment of the amateur camera work and poor sound quality which is on it! (The video was shot at two of Link's concert venues in the 90's in England, and, to be fair to the product, it would appear that recording opportunity at both was probably very limited for the technicians.) If there is any consolation, the interviewing with Link throughout the video gives a fascinating insight into the real person, and provides a wonderful verbal account by Link of the people with whom he has worked in the halcyon days of Rock'n'Roll ! It's a great shame that there doesn't appear to be any available footage of Link's earlier days."
3,Shipping Too Much,When it cost almost twice as much to ship an item then shipping cost has to be trimmed $7.95 for the item and $10.95 to ship it - too much - customers like myself will stop buying if the shipping keeps going up.
5,YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS BOOK,"I loved this book!Jeff Dobkin has done a fantastic job of providing a vast resource of marketing ideas for those who don't have a marketing budget.Not having a lot of money for marketing doesn't mean you can't be wildly successful. And if your pockets are bare, you can't live without this book.I've got so much out of this book. In fact, my copy looks like it's been through World War 3! It's been highlighted, corners bent, notes all over the place! It's great!"
1,Outdated techniques!!,"This books suggests that mailers and flyers are the way to go. ARE YOU KIDDING!!?!? If you are reading this review you know that the way most people shop is ONLINE! If you throw away envelopes of junk mail without opening them and wasting your time reading them what makes you think someone else won't do that with your ads that YOU PAID FOR!?!? I suggest you buy a book that is more to update such as:How to Use the Internet to Advertise, Promote And Market Your Business or Website With Little or No Money [PB,2006]. Don't waste your time on this book. It is meant for simpler times."
5,smells good,"This is like the third time I'm getting this particular cologne, the reason is so simple smells real good not too sweet but fresh, give it a try."
4,Great bargain!,"I was really surprised to find such a large bottle of this cologne for such a great price. Delivery was much faster than I anticipated too, especially considering it was Christmas time when I ordered it!"
5,"Excellent Product, Great results and long lasting","I've been using this scent for several years now, it is a refreshing cologne that isn't overbearing but strong enough to last all day. My girlfriend loves the scent and I've had nothing but positive comments when using this. Great cologne that I would recommend to anyone."
5,GREAT DEAL,"GREAT VALUE ,I GOT EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR THERE WERE NO MISTAKES IN THE ORDER WHEN I RECIVED THE SHIPMENT. MAKES GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFTS"
4,great gift for xmas,"it has a very nice smell and works great as a x-mas gift... this perfume is being launched with a large campaign and i think some people have been influenced by it, but in a postive way... i would highly recomend it..."
4,rock and roll in a bottle....,"it has a very nice smell and works great as a quick gift... this perfume is being launched with a large campaign and i think some people have been influenced by it, but in a postive way... i would highly recomend it..."
2,Not good!,Smell does nto stay for a long time...it smells good when you spray but it seems like the scent losses its fragrance right the other moment...Does not stay for a second...Would not recommend it to anyone...Or maybe I got a wrong supplier...I am not sure but there is something funky in the perfume...
4,Great perfume!,My dad wanted a bottle of this and I can't complain! It smells good and it's pretty cheap! Great choice.
5,"Smooth, manly, not over-bearing","I am very sensitive to cologne's, so it's been a struggle to find a good one for my husband that I can tolerate, and that we both like. We could never really agree on anything, until I bought this! I came across a young gentleman who smelled so good, I HAD to ask what he was wearing. He was wearing Soul. I couldn't believe the incredible price/value for the size bottle! I surprised my husband with this, and he LOVES it! When he puts it on, I can hardly contain myself ;o)"
1,Too sweet,"Just a little spray and you will have it for 1 week,lol. I believe this is mostly for teenagers and it has a strong sweet smell. Dont buy it."
3,got bored with it fast,"First time i used it it smelled pretty good (or so i thought)... but go bored with it fast. I think this is more for older men, maybe even seniors not for younger people. Gave it to my dad after couple of days."
4,Ladies love it when you smell nice!,This is actually one of the best smelling colognes i've ever owned. I get compliments every time i wear it. The ladies love it!
5,"Cuve Soul By Liz Claiborne, Tuccini 6.8 oz","Couldn't be happier, i have ordered this product time and time again. It has come at lightening speed to my mail box and it has take a little longer at times. Either way i do not give a rats behind on shipping. This product is [...] bucks where i live and for getting it for [...] dollars cheaper i throw a party every time i get this in the mail. Ty amazon and ty tuccini. This cologne makes every woman i come in contact with very very happy. much love and respect. thank you."
2,Taking a chance buying online,"I wasn't happy with this cologne,it doesn't resemble other Curve products,I would have returned it but when you buy cologne there is no returning.The only positive is when my wife cuddles up even hours later she says ""you smell good"" even though I can't smell it anymore, so I got that going for me."
3,Beware,"this scent smelled alot like candy. the scent wasnt bad, no immediate complaints at all. it just doesnt smell like its made for a man. id almost class this as highly feminine.nice scent. flip it to the girls though."
5,Cedric the Entertainer Presents,"Comedy at it's best! Cedris the Entetainer has done it! The episodes are quite hilarious, and his cast are very good. anyone who loves him, will definitely love this series! A must have!"
5,Humor at its best,"This is an excellent DVD box set and I am truly glad that I was able to purchase all of these episodes. In addition, there are episodes that were never aired, which is an extra bonus. For anyone who would love to laugh and cry out loud from these entertainers' extreme comedic talent, this is the DVD series for you!"
4,Lives up to his namesake,"Cedric is truly an entertainer. This mystifyingly short-lived series showcases his remarkable talents and is, in ways, a throwback to the 70's when Flip Wilson and Carol Burnett hosted such shows. The ensemble cast is excellent and it is obvious that they are having fun with each oddball role.And at under $20, this qualifies as a super steal. There are PG-13 moments in each episode, but for the most part, this is pretty clean fun."
4,Pleased,"The item came as a Christmas present and showed up on time, in a nondescript box and my husband was surprised at Christmas because he had no idea what it was until he opened it. The item was exactly what I ordered and my husband is enjoying this purchase."
1,Avoid at all costs,"I have now gone through two of these units. The first one lasted 10 months and the second one lasted 4 months. In both cases, the dvd player broke. Zenith's warranty is 3 months for labor so it would cost me more to repair it than to just buy a new one. I will never purchase a Zenith product again after this experience."
5,Great CD for the beginnig bellydancer,"This CD has a great mix of drum beats, upbeat, happy, songs, as well as slinky, slow, almost sexy melodies. This CD is actually one that I can just listen to in the car and dance to at home and in bellydance class."
5,Gong Hee Fat Choy,"I, too, have been using this book for over twenty years. And it now time to replace my tattered copy which is being held together with a paperclip. It is very easy to use and usually quite accurate. I am so thankful it is still in print. Buy the book, you will not be disappointed."
2,"Gong Hee Fot Choy, by Margarite Ward","The book arrived fine, but it did not include the playing board.... makes the game useless without the playing board!! And, Amazon does not have any complete games in stock..So, I was quite disappointed about that. I've returned the item, and have verified that it was received... now I'm waiting for the credit to be taken care of."
1,Makeup case fell apart within two months,"As a professional makeup artist for 15 years I have owned several cases. When my favorite case bit the dust in April, I purchased this case because I thought it was going to be bigger and be able to house all my makeup and airbrush in one place. I was so excited when it arrived in the mail until I started putting my makeup palettes in it. They didn't fit, the compartments on top were about 1/4 in. to short. I had to squeeze them in, my larger blush and lipstick palette's were about an inch to big. So most everything ended up in the bottom of the case smashed around my airbrush bag. I made due until Saturday when I tried to slide the top compartment closed and the right side would not slide in because the rivets securing it to the slider broke off. Also there is to much space from the top of the lid to the top of the first compartment box so items fall out of it all the time. This case is complete junk. Do not buy it."
2,cheap,cheaply made all around ;( ..made in china...and u cant return item if opened-be careful! tracking falls apart within days. do not buy this peoduct
1,Expensive Common Sense Advice,"I don't dispute Dr. Brazelton's advice on medical issues. On child care issues he seems like an aristocratic professor who handed off his own kids to wife and nanny and now sits in an ivory tower, smoking a pipe,dispensing common sense advice and collecting royalties. He just doesn't understand why you might not want your child in diapers and breastfeeding at age 3 or why the television might be on - in his world every child is an only child, and mothers don't work or have daycare providers like Mary Poppins. This book is just as arrogant and unrealistic as the other books he's written and the advice on breastfeeding problems could ONLY have been written by a man. The book in a nutshell: Don't sweat the vegetables - if your child gets enough milk and very little junk food, he'll be OK."
2,Need a study guide,"The author could have written a better textbook by leaving out the ""fluff."" The author either had to add ""filler"" to create a larger textbook or he ""likes to hear himself talk."" I suggest buying a study guide, if one is available."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","I agree mostly with what some of the other positive reviews read. The discussion about different design patterns was interesting to read.However, I did get caught up on the source code in the book. I would think that a book is supposed to be about ""best practices"" would handle quotes in database inserts/updates. Is it common practice to assume that your form data will never contain erroneous information that will cause your system to fail?I don't want to harp on this book too bad (many others are worse), but I am still searching for a solid JSP book that has sample code on how to build a solid/useful application from start to finish, while maintaining a clean separation of business logic and actual presentation."
1,Disappointing read,"I can save you money on the purchase of this book. If you can answer ""yes"" to the questions below, there is no need to buy this book:* Do you know what JSP and servlets are?* Do you know how to separate presentation and business logic with JavaBeans and custom tags?* Are you familiar with MVC?If so, no need for the book. I was expecting much more. It's less best practice, and more typical web app development. What disappointed me further was various comments in the text that displayed poor practices in areas outside of JSP web development, e.g. ""the first step in developing a jsp web application is designing the user interface.""My one-star rating can be summarized as follows:* Poor typesetting and book formatting: -1* Very few ""best practices"" -2* Below average writing, low content-to-price tag ratio -1"
5,Enormously helpful,"This book, more than any other I've read has opened my eyes to MVC programming with JavaServer pages. The examples were easy to follow and the text was very readable. With every page I was learning that I really hadn't understood as well as I thought!"
1,I couldn't handle it,"After smelling this stuff I really had to psych myself up to drink some. It tastes so bad that I just couldn't get it down. It smells more like new car scent spray than aloe and the taste isn't any better. Maybe this is really good for you and I'm sure that it has its health benefits, but it just tastes awful. I have tried other aloe juices before and they taste fine to me, but it's hard to compare them to this because I don't know which one is healthier. I'm not a picky eater and I was confident that I would like this, or at least be able to handle it, but I was wrong."
5,Calmed my digestive system down,Best recommendation that my family doctor gave me. Mix it in with a flavored sweetened drink or fruit juice. 2 oz a day will do it.
4,The same as the CD,"I have the CD by the same name and love it, so I bought the DVD. The seller that I bought it from though had the Asian copy (don't know if it was bootleg or not), and the name on the disc had incorrect spelling. The subtitles were also a bit off when I put them on. On the whole though, this is a great product and I love it very much. I would just be ware that this is an expensive disc for the correct (UK) version, but that'd be better than a Chinese or Thai copy."
5,Excellent Headphones,"Other then me sitting on them, these headphones are pretty indestructible.I have had them about a year and the sound was still great the fit was fairly good and they were very comfortable. At this low price they are WELL worth it.I am buying another pair as I destroyed the last.If I had not done that they would no doubt be still working perfectly and most likely would have lasted quite awhile more. I would definitely recommend these headphones."
1,not worth it,"I knew these would be cheap, but wow, they are just absolute garbage. They are on par with those $2 headsets on airplanes. I knew they wouldn't be anything amazing, but wow, they are just such bad quality. Zero care or passion was put into these and it shows. Buying these is the equivalent of throwing money in the trash. I just can't believe that cyber acoustics would put their name on something this bad."
2,"Beware--8.5 foot cord, not-so-good-quality","Tried as a lower-cost alternative to a low cost option (Koss Titanium w/ vol control). The cord on this is 8.5 feet long. Might be OK for some, but not for me. No disclosure of cord length. Quality is consistent with reduced price of $10, but still not worth it. Amazon refunded with no hassle."
2,"Poor sound quality. You can only hear the music, not the voices or background sound.","I got these headphones a few weeks ago and now you can't hear the singers' voices in any in the music. I first thought there was something wrong with my iPod, but I tried my computer's headphone jack and several other devices and realized that it was my headphones. It sound weak and I wonder why the price dropped so low. Now I must buy another pair. It is worth the money to just buy a more expenisive pair of headphones."
4,I cannot believe I actually enjoyed the annoying Steve Carell!,"I dislike Steve Carell. I just don't get his acting. Having said that, he did a wonderful job in this movie. Although part of this movie is far fetched, overall, the movie is funny and it does make a married person reflect on his or her relationship with the spouse. I hate to say this- Steve Carell is likeable in this movie. Oh, I think I want to puke now."
3,"Fantastic movie, but Ultraviolet = Cancelled order.","I *loved* this movie, and pre-ordered it almost a month ago when it simply said, ""+ Digital Copy."" Having found the Ultraviolet version of ""Horrible Bosses"" to be nothing but a headache and a waste of money (repeated error messages, confusing menus, unable to download a copy to my computer, cannot use with iPad/iPhone *without* Wi-fi...vastly inferior to the iTunes digital copy that you can download and put on *all* your devices).Such a great movie, but I'm never touching anything with the words ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy"" on it again."
2,WHY?,I have read many reviews. All i can say after watching this movie is why would anyone in the right mind give this five stars. Watch the first 5 minutes and then the last 20 minutes and then you can give it 5 stars. Dont waste your time and money. Watch a better movie that people are actually making intelligent conversation. I dont even want to recollect the movie to specify why it was terrible. It just was. Just really baffled by why people would love it.Great actors but terrible screenplay.
3,"Decent movie, no real stand out parts","I thought that this movie was pretty decent for the most part, but there wasn't as much comedy as I might have expected and the story doesn't completely wrap up at the end."
5,Feel-good romantic comedy/drama,"This movie is one of my favorite Steve Carell movies ever. I am a big fan of his. I watched 3 of his recent films in a row, this one last, and it was the best of the three. It has a great cast, great story, and you will love it!"
5,Awesome. Would see again and again!,"Watched this movie with some friends for Girls Night In. All of the girls had seen it except me, but they unanimously said they would see it again if I wanted to see it. They said it was ""that good."" After watching the movie, I had to completely agree!"
4,Crazy Stupid Love,Funny movie! Enjoyed watching.My husband and I had an enjoyable eveningviewing the movie together.We would recommend it to others!
4,Sweet mature romantic comedy,"I really liked Carrell more after seeing him in this movie. He plays sensitive and loving very well! This is a movie for adults, about adults trying to work out issues during the breakup of their marriage. Sometimes funny, mostly sweet."
2,Crazy Stupid Movie,"This movie will bore to death even the most romantic people. Nothing makes sense or click in this movie. The only parts that entertained me was the lounge scenes, but the screenplay was equally bad as the rest of the movie. Not sure how Ryan Gosling decided to take part in this movie."
2,Terrible!,"Based on the powerhouse of a cast (particularly Gosling and Moore), I expected this film to be funny and intelligent. It was neither! Instead, it was incredibly trite, unrealistic and filled with lowbrow humor. SUCH a disappointment."
3,Audio mixed by first year film student?,"I don't mind when movies are loud.But that doesn't mean I don't get stressed out when I have to watch obnoxiously loud movies with people (women) who don't like loud movies.This movie needs to be watched on TV speakers... if you dare watch it on a stereo system, you will be unexpectedly bombasted with thumping unbalanced uncompressed club music in which every 2nd goddamned scene in this movie's first act takes place in.It's like when you watch TV and then the commercial breaks are illegally 5x as loud.This isn't an action movie, so why is the audio mixed like one?P.S.The movie is semi-decent and is oriented towards bored women and their docile husbands/boyfriends who can tolerate the material."
3,"Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are great, the story is trite","Trite romantic comedy that promotes lies about true love and relationships through cliches, but at least you get to see Ryan Gosling shirtless."
1,Don't buy until they quit using ultraviolet,"I liked the movie, but can't support this version until they include a true digital copy. Ultraviolet is not the digital copy we've all been expecting."
1,Disgusting,"I cannot believe the positive reviews for this movie. I rented it based on the number of five stars it received here. It was disgusting. I'm surprised that these otherwise great actors thought this script was a good idea. This movie is messed up. I'm sorry, but the babysitter/son/husband plot made me sick to my stomach. This is what passes for quality entertainment these days? Crazy and stupid indeed."
1,Vulgar,"My title pretty much says it all; should have been rated ""R."" By the way, had to give it one star in order to print the review. It doesn't deserve even one star..."
1,Ew.,"This movie was disgusting and lewd. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. Made jokes about horrible things. just plain ew."
1,What will they think of next??,"""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a great, heart-warming story about divorce, adultery, fornication, masturbation, child pornography and more child masturbation for a happy ending.The big question is: What will they think of next??"
4,The only good Steve Corell movie,"While this movie wasn't exactly what I expected going in, it still was rather enjoyable. Steve Corell finally managed not to ruin something he played in, that alone ought to be worth a watch."
5,The perfectly crafted movie,I love this movie because of the theme and how wonderful all of the performances were; even the children..especially Jonah Bobo.What made me want to add it to my library was how well the story was told. I think Dan Folgelman is a great screenwriter. I recently read that what he originally wrote is what we see on the screen. Good study guide for screenwriters like myself.
5,gift,This was purchased as a gift and arrived quickly (and in time for) the gift exchange. I was very pleased with my purchase.
5,Crazy Stupid Not to get this DVD,Loved the movie in the theater and knew I'd add it to my DVD collection. Terrific writing. Very funny. Good characters well acted and a nice twist that I genuinely did not see coming. Kuds to Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. The whole cast shines.
4,Smart and funny comedy,"Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore call it curtains on their marriage because of Moore's fidelity. The movie then becomes about Carrell trying to make a sense about the breakup and his single life. He is befriended by a young mentor ( Ryan Gosling) who is determined to teach him a thing or two about becoming a ladies man. In a way, this film could have been very cliched but it survives on the chemistry of the two leads, Gosling and Carrell. Emma Stone and Julianne Moore are okay and Kevin Bacon along with Marisa Tomei are great as well.Formulaic but great actors make the film watchable. four stars 1/15/2012"
3,Crazy Stupid Love,Steve Carrell is whipping them out so fast that he is becoming the Tom Cruise of Comedy you forget you are watching a movie but watching Steve Carrell....not good. Ryan Gosling is amazing .. what a range of talent. Julianne Moore can't be better her range is fantastic. The story is cute. I do not think it is a 5 star but I enjoyed it.
1,DOES NOT WORK.,This dvd will not work. It is unable to work outside of US or Canada due to 'regional restrictions'. It was illegaly sold to me. Also to return teh item it will cost me $15 for postage and packaging is is more than the item what i paid for that doesnt work. Also i cannopt contaxct the seller because there is no details. Very bad buy and i am very upset.
3,Had higher expectations,"As my header suggests, I had higher hopes for this movie. Steve Carrel is in the same boat as Will Ferrell for me when it comes to carrying a movie. I prefer them in supporting roles as opposed to the lead. Thought the movie did a better job of showing a family dissolve than say the Break Up, but at some points the movie was hard to watch. My favorite part of the film has to be where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's characters stay up all night. Thought it was a very endearing scene. The movie was worth watching for that part alone."
1,Annoyingly bad,I'd heard so many people say this movie was great. I don't get it. The characters were one-dimensional and the situations ridiculous without being funny. A waste of time.
1,Why the French are so much better at this kind of film,"Clumsy, awkward, situation-driven (as opposed to character-driven). No characters (except for Emma Stone's) are allowed the least bit of believability or spontaneity. Any capable French director would have done much much better, and would have made this kind of farce funnier and more believable. The situations are all way too contrived and there isn't one single spontaneous honest laugh in the entire movie. Big disappointment."
1,Awesome Movie! Dont bother getting it if you wanted a Digital Copy,Love the movie!! Its great i recommend it to everyone! But if your buying this for a digital copy like I was don't bother It does not go on your Ipod! WTF! If you want this on your iTunes account it wont work : Just buy the DVD or the Blu-Ray and download it from your iTunes account if want a digital copy.
5,Loved it!,This movie was hilarious! The cast was amazing! I thought that the twist at the end was pretty surprising but you could get an idea of what was going to happen if you really thought about it. Emma stone and Steve Carrel did a great job! I really loved this movie and so did the rest of the audience I saw it with. Also it got 5 stars from EW. So that must mean it is good. Haha. Great movie!
2,They should have stopped at Crazy Stupid...,"What a waste. My husband and I rarely get enough time to sit down and enjoy a movie, and we wasted time trying. We kept watching thinking, maybe this will get better. It didn't, so we decided to make fun of it, at least that got us laughing.My husband thinks he has a paper from his creative writing class in 10th grade that would make a better script.Don't watch this movie unless you are 12 or high."
4,"Crazy, Stupid Love",This was a wonderful movie . . . it was fun and kept my interest. I'm a great fan of Steve Carell and he did not disappoint me. I would recommend for people to buy it.
4,"Definitely worth the watch, even if it's not entirely believable.","This movie was a slow start, and I found myself wondering, ""Oh, God, what if all the best parts were in the previews?"" I hate it when that happens. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the twist at the end. There was more than enough comedy (after the first 30 minutes) to get me through the film. Will I watch this again? Definitely. Favorite movie of all time? Not necessarily. There were some ""really?"" moments, and you'll know them when you see them. A good laugh out loud movie. Very nice."
3,"Great movie, should have been rated ""R"" though.","***SPOILERS*** PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO BE TOTALLY SURPRISED WHEN YOU WATCH THE MOVIE YOURSELFThe casting for this movie is superb. The plot is realistic. The screenplay is smart. I laughed a lot. I cried a little. I loved all the characters. My problem was that this movie got a PG-13 rating even though it involved a 17-year-old taking nude photos of herself with the intent of giving them to a 40-year-old man (don't worry, she gives them to the 13-year-old she babysits instead), and a bit of ""sexting"" involving the 13-year-old. Not to mention the whole story is laced with careless sex. I would NOT want my teenager to watch this movie at all, but if they did I would want to have watched it myself and be able to talk about these things."
3,The name does little for this DVD,Too much Steve Carroll and not enought Julianne Moore or Ema Stone. Wish it had some other lead actor in this DVD.
4,Perfect gift!,"My girlfriend loves this movie and was happy to get it! Recommended for everyone who wants a cool, cute love story with a twist!"
5,my wife made me watch this movie and i laughed my ass off.,This is a super funny flick. nicely done and worth watching. the characters in this movie are well developed and weavered together.
5,"love the cast. smart, funny flick.",i surprised myself laughing out loud at this one. two thumbs up! very well cast - excellent use of kevin bacon and marisa tomei.
1,OMG-So painful to watch!,"I've never looked at my watch so many times praying for the 1:52 to finally arrive! So painfully dull, formulaic and cliche! The title say's it al: Crazy - yes the characters are all crazy! Stupid- they fit that criteria as well! And Love-they love to screw one another with lies and deceit! I've never hated Steve Carell until now. This shows just how one dimensional of an actor he is. For the love of G_d, what is the talented Julianne Moore doing in this schlock?! I really can't believe so many people like this... it makes me sad just how pathetic hollywood has become putting out this garbage."
1,stupid @#%)#(%*&^,"Ryan Gosling has sucked before, Steve Carrell has sucked,in some previous appearances. This movie accomplishes a trifecta otherwise, though, It is the worst movie appearance ever of Julianne Moore, the worst movie appearance ever for Marisa Tomei,and a pretty mediocre outing for Kevin Bacon."
5,Snuck up on me,"I'd heard this movie was good, but I had no idea it would be this good. Genuinely funny and heart-warming, great cast, great inter-generational plot lines. Truly one of my favorite movies in years even though it is, in many ways, a small and quiet comedy. Highly, highly recommend."
5,Crazy Stupid Love,I loved this movie! Ryan Gosling can make any movie good! But I also really enjoyed Steve Carell. Very cute movie!
5,Great!,Great movie! Great story! The cast is awesome I have always been such a big fan of Steve Carell! I could watch iPhone watch this m8vie over and over again!
1,"Great movie, problem with packaging","One of the best films of the year. I was excited to get it on DVD, but the packaging leaves an ugly strip down the side of the DVD case. It's a relatively small complaint, I know, I was just annoyed at the fact that these people can't even package a DVD correctly. It shouldn't be too difficult."
2,Didn't Stand Up to the Hype,"It's slow in the beginning and middle, and doesn't get good or interesting until towards the end. I just felt like they dragged it on, and on. The first hour and a half is just about the main character trying to lay a bunch of women. I won't ruin the plot for people who are still interested in watching this, but consider this a heads-up."
5,Great Friday night for both,We ordered Crazy Stupid Love on Amazon instant video. My hubby and I really both liked this movie. There are some great scenes that are creative and you actually feel for the characters. The character development is great! We both were laughing and worried for Steve Carell.
4,A well-crafted movie.,"Steve Carrel is really starting to grow on me. In fairness to me, he's taking better roles. Of all his work so far, this one stretches him farthest as an actor...and he was equal to it.All the cast meshed in this. It helped to have dialogue that made sense without sounding 'written' by someone else. As a writer myself, I appreciate a script that isn't predictable or cliche'. This one stood out.Direction was paced well. Fast when it needed to be and slow when listening was important.I cared about the characters. I cared about what happened to them. Essentially, it just sucked me in, which is what storytelling is supposed to do.After renting it, we went out and bought a copy. It deserves to be viewed again."
4,Thought This Would Be SO Stupid,"I really thought this was going to be dumb. I'm starting to feel like Steve carrell plays the same part in every film he is in, except for 40 year old virgin.This was a pretty good movie, nice twist for a romantic comedy, some more updated dialog than many of the films in this genre. It may also be comfortable watching as a couple or a first date, as there is a sub-plot that seems tailor made for guys. It had its issues with the script after the surprise toward the late middle. But it gets back on its feet and gives us a pretty good ending. It's also a bit cross-generational. I'm turning 40 soon and I'd be comfortable watching this with my younger cousins in their 20s."
4,Fun movie...,This was Ryan's movie. He was hysterical in it. However the movie could have been cut in half. Definately some slow periods.
5,So many truths,"I'm not normally a fan of Ryan Gosling, but I will say he did a nice job in this movie. I do love Steve Carell, though, and he exudes sincerity as he does so well in dramatic roles. This movie was engaging on many levels, because so many different stages of love are addressed. I typically groan at the sight of a romantic comedy and even though this is one in a way, it also has deeper themes. Well done."
2,Barely worth renting,This movie got a few laughs out of me. Some parts were interesting. The kid in this movie bugs me to no end. Not a complete waste of time but certainly would not recommend it.
2,"Crazy, Stupid, Dirty","I watched this movie because of all the good reviews and I love Steve Carell. He should have stayed in his office at Dunder Mifflin. I have yet to like any movies he's been in. Not that I'm blaming him for the two hours of crap I just watched. I liked all the actors but the story was poorly written, in fact the idea itself was junk. They could have sent a clearer better message. I got bored as the same old parts of alcohol and girls with no respect for themselves dragged on. Ninety percent of the jokes were dirty which IMO are never creative, not funny and just plain gross. I agree with another review that said the whole son bit should have been taken out. Shudder. Why do I always waste my money on the dumb movies? But please by all means, if you like uncomfortable dirty jokes, lame uninspiring dialogues, and a bunch of people sleeping around, watch this. Sadly I know many of you out there will."
1,2 Dimensional Characterts/Disgusting Scene,"Someone recommended this film, and even though I think Steve Carrell is a terrible actor (he only knows how to play the nerd apparently), I decided to give it a try. First of all, the characterization in this film was awful. The marital problems were glossed over, and the 13 year-old kid did things no 13 year-old would be stupid enough to do. The worst part comes later in the movie when the teenage babysitter develops a crush on Carrell's character. I suppose the filmmakers thought this was funny, but I don't find it remotely humorous when an underage character sends nude photos to a grown man. It's not even believable, because let's face it, Carrell is a minus ten in looks.On the bright side, Gosling did a great job in the secondary romance. Too bad the main story was awful. I highly recommend viewers skip this if they are sensitive to issues dealing with inappropriate relationships with minors."
1,Garbage,What puerile crap this was. MEN DO NOT BEHAVE THIS WAY and if they do then whatever they suffer they deserve.
1,Horror Flick Redux,"Like a horror film where the dead guy keeps coming back to life, you FINALLY get to the point where the guy gets his wife back and it falls apart again. Should have stopped watching way before this. Because the horror is I wasted two hours of my life watching this half-heartedly acted, insipid, predictable movie."
1,Movie - great!! Ultraviolet = crap!!,"The movie was awsome!! Ultraviolet was a travesty!! The digital copy isn't really a digital copy. I thought I had to create an account with Flixter to get the download, but the only thing that downloaded was the Flixter software and no movie. Apparently it was too hard to give us a downloaded digital copy!!"
3,The Ending Makes Up For The Rest,"Honestly, this movie isn't that funny overall, but that might be because it's tuned for an older audience. Viewers the age of Steve Carell will love this movie, no doubt. But fans of Gosling might find it harder to stomach. Being that I am of the latter, I quickly got tired of the ""Carell trying to be like Gosling"" shtick and cared way more about Emma Stone and Gosling's relationship.Thankfully, the last 20-30 minutes of the film are amazing and made up for the rest of it, the scene in the backyard is so perfectly constructed."
4,My wife likes this movie a lot.,"I bought it for her for Christmas. It's not an unbearable movie for guys to watch either. There's some good parts to laugh at outside of all the romance. One of the more guy-friendly ""chick flicks"" out there."
5,Funny,Great movie to watch with a significant other. Not the funniest movie but Emma Stone is super cute in this movie. As always.
3,Really about 3.5 stars . . .,"This CD was . . . okay. That's the best way I can put it. I haven't seen the series and mainly wanted the opening theme song ""Infinity,"" which is really good, the best song on the CD in my opinion. But as for the rest . . . most of the songs are largely forgettable, though a few were mildly enjoyable, such as ""UN-LIMITED,"" ""Tears in Heaven,"" and ""Be Myself."" But again, overall the CD wasn't that great . . . not terrible, but not outstanding, just slightly above average."
4,Bad reviews undeserved.,"... I saw that one of my favorite actresses (Robin Wright) was one of the stars. I found the story intriguing and heart-wrenching. Beautiful ""Loon"" (played by Wright) carries a torch for her long-lost lover (played by Jason Patric) by becoming the kind of woman he wanted her to be, even though it's too late. After encountering an old friend (played by Rae Dawn Chong), memories haunt her relentlessly. When she discovers that her old boyfriend has gone on with his life, she painfully realizes that she still has a life to live. Not your regular run-of-the-mill entertainment that hollywood doles out, but that makes it all the better in my opinion. Worthwhile."
3,Hard to find this one!,"I saw this movie a few years ago, and it was hard to find, it's very hard to follow, really skips back and forth in time. I have watched it several times now and have really gotten it. If you like Jason Patrick and Robin Wright you will prob like this one. Sort of slow moving also,"
2,Nepotism abounds in his reviews!,"Amazing! The reviews not this book), are amazing. Why? Because Mr. Stephen Stallard seems to have enlisted the help of friends and relatives to give this item 5-star reviews.This book is interesting but certainly not page-riveting. Not something I'd read more than once or give a place of honor on my bookshelf at home.Writing is juvenile, taking liberties with history. I am a history major with a minor in American Literature. NOTICE, THIS IS ONE REVIEW BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN MR. STALLARD'S FAMILY!!!!!"
2,Kind of bland,"This oatmeal was very bland tasting. I could taste a little vanilla flavor, but not the fruit. Still I suppose I can buy some minced peach fruit cups, and mix one in. It was easy to prepare and pretty filling. I just expected a lot more flavor."
2,did not taste good,"arrived on time, all that is well, but did not taste good! i mean it's quick, microwaveable, etc., but the taste was off and i couldn't even finish the pack of 6."
3,Tastes OK,"I bought this product because of the convenience to take anywhere. Price is great, but the taste was pretty bland. I was definitely full after eating this, but the taste wasn't what I expected. Try for yourself!"
4,"healthful, not too sweet hot cereal","This cereal has great texture (not over-processed) and the portion size is generous. It also is not overly sweetened and has great flavor from the fruit.I became aware of this product through my workplace cafeteria. Unfortunately, when I ordered the peach raspberry oatmeal online, I was sent onion soup instead. Food items are not returnable, so I am stuck with something that I did not order."
1,Didn't not like at all,Didn't not like this at all. Didn't taste good and we hated it so much that we threw all of them in the trash. I don't recommend at all. I rather stick with the old fashion oatmeal. It comes out just right.
5,are you ready to flow?,"I just saw Scott Henry spin here in Charlotte...he's incredible, he takes the time to interact with the crowd and he's so much fun to watch. Smile Mix Session 1 is mixed well and the songs are great in and of themselves. Get out your glow sticks!"
4,Nice looking product,"Bought eight of them for my new house. They are a little smaller than expected, but they look good on the house, and the colors are perfect. Best part is that it's easy to change bulbs (a nightmare on some outside lights), and they don't catch bugs, so you don't have to go ""eeeeew!"" every time you need to change a bulb. However, do be careful when installing, as the glass panels can slip out and break."
2,Mediocre,This salt in taste tests does worse than Morton's Kosher. It has absolutely no sea taste at all. Look to a grey salt for a grinder.
2,Not as it was described,"I cook with French gray sea salt all the time. I bought this particular salt because of the description as 'gray French Sea Salt' It neither is gray nor does it feel like Gray French Sea Salt, which is moist. This salt is white and dry. The flavor is also lacking. It was expensive and not worth the price. The vendor was prompt in getting it to me."
5,Totally Happy,My son bought me a set of these for Christmas two years. I love them. We use them every day. My Mom had some of these when I was growing up and every time I use them they always bring back a lot of good memories so.....I just ordered a set for my best friend for Christmas. I know she will love them too because she always wants to take mine home with her.
2,Disappointed,"Gotta tell you after reading the ""glowing"" reviews given this product I just had to make the purchase of not only the glasses but the bowls as well.I couldn't wait to open the box but found myself totally disappointed when I took the product out of the box. I either received my order from another vendor than the rest of you or I was expecting a far better product.I will be returning both items for a refund. ""Sad face"" as I was really looking forward to some childhood memory drinkware."
1,bad surprise,the don't send you the things in the picture they only send me some of the cupsi think they cheat me
5,Picture is deceiving...but retro kitchenware is GREAT.,"The glasses are what I wanted but thought it was great when I saw everything pictured for the $19.99 comparing to other views of the retro kitchenware. I actually was expecting the pitcher and the ice cream bowls! These glasses are definitely what I wanted for my gift but I figured why not get it all if I can. After receipt of only the glasses, I realized that was not the intent of the seller. I would recommend the seller only shows what is for sale for the price....don't show the bowls and pitcher. Other than that, this retro kitchenware is spot on to what was popular in our home when I was young!"
5,Great Cups -- Picture Misleading,I love these cups however the description and picture are a bit misleading... I would reccomend them just make sure you know you are only getting the cups.
5,LOVE!,"Have cups, bowls and pitcher! Ideal to keep cool drinks or deserts cooler. Even in the summer! We use in our hottub, and love!"
4,Good for fans of the anime Bleach,"The main reason anyone would consider buying this disc is because they've probably heard the song My Pace as an outro from the Bleach anime. The second track is much more mellow than the title track, showing this groups' deeper ability.Personally, I bought it for the Bleach, but now I'm a fan of the group. Not bad at all.Track 01 - My Pace (TV Version)Track 02 - Suna no ObjectTrack 03 - My Pace (Karaoke Version)"
1,don't waste your money,"The leather was nice but the clip sucks, it lasted a week. Once the clip is gone it's nothing but fodder."
5,What a terrific book!,"Not much time, but this book is terrific! It had me completely enthralled, and driving my family up the wall with gasps of ""Ohmigod, she almost killed Chakotay!"" and ""Paris, you idiot!"" etc. etc. I almost did not get this book. I am so glad I did! Wow!"
4,"Not quite a ""how-to"" book!","This is a good read, and an important book, if only because so many law texts get the real story wrong. Morland's account is even more relevant today in this era of terrorism.In point of fact, the previous reviewer gets it wrong--this book would not be of any use to a foreign government. Morland didn't print a ""how-to-build"" the hydrogen bomb article in the Progressive--it was how it worked. There's a key difference."
2,cheesy stuff - not the real thing,"Come on, if you like this CD you are deprived. This is simplistic stuff, formulated techno that sounds massproduced for the dumb drugged masses. There are some half good songs but this is a lame representation of what the techno scene used to be like."
2,wrong size,"did not fit. was not amazon's fault. recommended to amazon to work closer with vendors to verify fit. my car is a 1999 infiniti q45, so belts and hoses are difficult to find. no problem on return. great service from amazon."
3,Another Profile Book,"This is another airplane profile book, with a lot of pictures and little substance. Why is it that aviation writers have the idea that the people who buy their books can't read, but like to look at pictures? However, if you want a profile book, this is the one to have. It has the best information related to the various models of the airplane. But if you want to find out what C-130s have done, look somewhere else.Sam McGowanC-130/Vietnam Veteran, author ""The Cave"", a novel of the Vietnam War."
2,"""Basic Climbing""","If you are very recent to climbing, you might like this book. Otherwise skip it.No doubt Peter Croft is a climbing genius, but his book contains little insight for anyone other than novices. But I agree with the 13 year-old: the intro is great reading. This guy has done some great climbing.Why 2 stars ? In this book, there is actually a drawing of a nalgene bottle and water filter with the caption ""Water Filter and Bottle"". He also informs us that a bivy sack is smaller and lighter than a tent. And that a headlamp is better than a flashlight because you can still use your hands. And that a map and compass are usefull items when in unfamiliar terrain. Wow. I can't wait to take this insight into the mountains.There are a few tidbits of good info here - but surf the web and get better info for free."
2,Not impressed,"This book is very much dissappointing. The matieral covered is very shallow, and certainly doesn't have anything that isn't covered in Freedom of the Hills. The drawings and photographs are all very basic. He tells a few good stories, but none are deep or insightful enough to convey a lesson. Save you money towards FOTHs, John Long's Climbing Anchors, or Extreme Alpinism."
2,Disappointing,"Croft is a legendary climber, and has contributed greatly to the sport and to its literature. However, this little book is not his best work. There is almost nothing here that isn't covered in ""Freedom of the Hills"", and if you want the graduate text, buy Mark Twight's ""Extreme Alpinism"". However, if you are a complete ""newby"" to the sport of alpinism, this will provide some useful information and entertain you for a few evenings. Experienced climbers will likely be disappointed in this rather unambitious book."
3,papi@cdw.com,Wisin and Yandel are good rappers from Puerto Rico. I just think that with the both of them rapping as a duel on this album they should have made a few more tracks.
3,Leg Pillow,"Although I had high hopes for this pillow to releive hip pain when lying on my side, it didn't do as good a job as I'd hoped. I believe it needs to be a little less spongy in order to keep knees apart more, without being uncomfortable."
2,Too soft for pregnancy leg support,"Does not relieve the discomfort of side-sleeping during pregnancy. Once it warms up, the memory foam compresses completely and stops holding your knees apart."
2,Contour Knee Pillow,"I bought this pillow for a chronic back problem, didn't really get any relief. The pillow doesn't fit very well and caused me more pain trying to get the right adjustment. Did give it to my daughter and she loves it, this pillow might be geared for someone younger and more flexible."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I wish I could send it back, but I foolishly discarded the packaging when I opened it.The pillow ""exhales"" as soon as any pressure is put on it. You can crush it with your finger."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,Purchased pillow after doctor said I should use one to help a back problem. A regular pillow was too big and was hard to sleep with so I purchased this one. It is easier to sleep with but is very soft so I have to move it around a lot during the evening to have it help my back. It does work with helping me sleep on my side without any pain..but it does slip a lot so I wake up and have to reposition it.
1,this pillow sucks!,"someone i know has this pillow, so after trying it out i thought it looked really good. i bought one (though not from amazon), it worked great for a couple weeks, then just flattened out to the point where i could feel my knees through it! i called the company and complained that i must have gotten a defective one (since my friend's was still in great shape after several months of daily use). they sent another one free of charge, the 1st night it was great, but from then on it was just as flat as the 1st one i had gotten! and i am a petite and small female, not that it should even matter if a knee pillow is of good quality. total waste of time and money. just bought the carex knee pillow through amazon, we'll see how it holds up.."
1,Useless,"This knee pillow supposed to support. Let's start with it that the middle of the pillow is only 3 inches thick.Once I put my knee on it it flattens to 1/2 inch (and I am a small woman, 5'3"" and weighing only 118 lb).This knee pillow might be good for others but for me it is useless."
1,What memory?,"This product is very disappointing. The cover is nice, but the foam compresses too easily and does not provide the leg support found in other such pillows."
2,Too Small,I am using a normal pillow right now to use between my legs and I thought the contour would be a better fit for my spine. The pillow is too small though and it does not stay in the correct position for me.
2,Too Soft for My Taste,"I wanted to pillow that I could put my legs in between while I sleep, but this was much too soft. Like all memory foam products, make sure to air this out a few days before actually using it."
1,Totally useless,"This is a nice block of memory foam. It was the correct, and pleasing shade of green as advertised.That being said, it is totally useless at the intended purpose of supporting your knees while you sleep.It might be good for an infant or toddler - but anyone larger, aka, anyone who has back problems that necessitate knee support, will find that it compresses down to nothing -providing no support.I cannot recommend this to anyone else, unless they just want a block of foam to cut or use for other purposes."
2,Caution: for some may create extra strain on knees,"Because it is short my PT told me to stop using it. Something longer is needed to support on both sides of the knees or leverage pressure will be created below knees. It may be right for some, and I am not knocking this product per se. Just a cautionary note.What I liked about it was that it stayed between legs well."
2,too thin,"I purchased this item hoping it would help ease my back pain in bed. The memory foam is so thin in the middle where it goes between your legs, and then the weight of your legs squishes it to nothing. In the end, my knees are not as aligned with my hips as I hoped. Wish i got the one that looks thicker."
2,too small,"While the memory foam in this pillow is of good quality and the craftsmanship seems equally good, this pillow is too small to do an adult much good. It is much smaller than you might think and will not serve its intended purpose. It could be perfect perhaps for a child."
5,pretty cool,I use almost everynight and it does what it says. didnt make my knees feel much better or worse but if I could go back to when my knee started hurting I would have bought it back in 09 vs 2012.
1,disappointing,"bought both a blue and a green ""knee pillow"" . When they arrived, the blue was fine but the green one was as dense as a rock with no give. Very uncomfortable!. Kept the blue, returned the green"
4,Memory foam leg pillow,I purchsed this pillow for my sister-in-law who justhad her knee replaced. I had used one when I hada similar surgery with my knees. I loved it and itaided in my recovery. It allows you to get into acomfortable position with the support that you need.You can also use it on the healthy leg which needsrelief as well. Because you are laying down a lot itworked under your elbow and upper arm area. When youreally get bored you can throw it at someone withouthurting them!!!
3,Zipper Issues,Nice product other than the faulty zipper on the cover. It broke after three weeks of routine use.
1,Too soft!,This pillow was too soft! It needs to be firm enough to keep your knees apart which is the whole purpose in using a leg pillow in the first place. This pillow was so soft that my knees ended up mashing it within minutes and therefore my knees were touching and the pillow was useless. I don't recommend this for anyone who needs a pillow for knee support for proper spine alignment and back health.
2,Not that Great,"This is a really soft pillow, with a very nice soft cover. Unfortunately, the inside is too soft to provide enough support for most people. When I put it between my legs, it gets compressed too easily and my legs touch, which is not what is supposed to happen. This leg pillow doesn't provide enough support to keep your legs apart while sleeping."
1,waste of money... too soft,"I purchased and was very disappointed with this pillow. I have used these types of leg spacer pillows for years and gotten as lot of relief from back pain. I purchased this one thinking it might be even be better at a higher price and alleged ""memory foam"". The foam is very soft and the pillow was unusable. I threw it away. I am back to using the ""Core"" brand pillow. Much better and a fraction of the price. Save yourself some money and frustration... get another brand."
1,Goes flat immediately,The foam in this pillow is not strong enough to use as a leg pillow.....I suppose you could use it under your head....if you don't mind sleeping on a flat pillow.
3,Contour Memory Foam Leg Pillow,It was too thick for me but my husband uses his. I like the more soft and smaller one I have had for years.
2,works for my husband.....not so much for me....,"I ordered these for both myself and my husband. He uses his nightly...I used mine once and it flattened on me....not to regain it's ""memory""! Also....DO NOT FALL for the slippers they offer when you get your knee pillow. I ordered these as well, mine are OK, I guess (they flatten on the first use and do NOT regain their ""MEMORY""!!) and my husbands arrived FLAT AS A PANCAKE with ""NO MEMORY"" at all. This offer is a WASTE of the $5.99 it will cost you to get them. Also, there seems no way to regain your loss of that money. DON'T BOTHER!!!!!!! CANNOT RECOMMEND THESE PRODUCTS!!!!"
4,It works but I still prefer by pillow.,"As a recovered back surgery patient, this product works well between the legs for comfort if you sleep with both legs in the same posistion. But I tend to be all over the place so I still prefer a regular pillow to keep me aligned."
1,Way too soft,These pillows are too soft to offer any support. They compress down to only 1 inch thick.
2,Does not support leg,"I needed and still do need a leg pillow to keep my hip and legs aligned because I have sciatica. I was very sad to find that this pillow made from memory foam does not support my leg because it squashes too thin and is therefore useless for my needs. If it were designed with a layer of other firmer supportive foam in the center, it might work. It arrived quite hard from the cold weather but the warmth of my body changed the dynamics completely. Not good for keeping your legs and hips aligned.Contour Memory Foam Leg Pillow with Cover, Blue"
3,leg Pillow is small,"The pillow is small , and it doesn't do well on warm days. Since your body heat will be higher on warm days this leg pillow will sag down."
2,Just too squishy.,"I'm adding mine to the ""too soft"" reviews. I thought I would take a chance on this knee pillow, as I have very narrow hips and thought the pillow would provide enough separation between my knees to keep me comfortable (plus the knee pillow with the highest rating on Amazon isn't available). I received the pillow yesterday and immediately saw how squishy it is. It really has no structure of its own, and is much squishier than Tempurpedic mattresses and pillows, for example. I gave it a try last night, and confirmed that it won't work for me; just as others have experienced, I found that my knees were nearly touching. This would only work for someone who simply doesn't want their knees touching, but doesn't need to separate their knees to hip width for comfort. On to find another option. On the positive side, the pillow does have a very attractive and soft cover."
2,Didn't work with my body type,I bought this pillow because I have back problems but noticed after a few days that it was only making my back hurt more. But I got a second one for my husband at the same time and he loves his so it goes to show it just depends on your body type.
5,Great Costume,This is a great costume and my kid loves it! If your child wants to go trick or treating as a werewolf than this is the one to get.
2,Why is straight sex so boring?,"This series would have been a lot better if at least one of the lead couples had been gay. Straight people in real life are not much more boring than gay people are, but in most movies and on TV they are so shallow, dull and predictable that watching them do anything - especially have sex - is a big yawn. I found myself wishing for more of the therapy sessions with Jane Alexander, just because she is such a delight. This is not the worst thing I have ever seen, but it is hard to get through if you are gay. It was for me, anyway."
1,snore-fest,"What a snore-fest! About all I saw in the first episode, were 3 couples talking (or, actually, arguing & debating each other for the most part) about their relationships, falling out of love, wanting more attention from the other, wondering if they should get more serious or back off, etc. ...Jeez, if I wanna hear this kinda stuff, I can go visit my grandparents! I watch DVDs because I want to be entertained!!!"
2,Not a good starting point.,"I bought this book for my mom and she says that it isn't a good starting point for readers new to this type of lifestyle.She claims that it is informative, and that it talks greatly about the spiritual aspect of this lifestyle, but she found it harder to get into then other books she's read on the subject."
5,Songs for the Haunted Heart,"Today I arrived home and find this album in my mail. How my heart sings! The tunes are my friends in this quiet time when everything's dark and you feel so alone.Some of the best songs are not very commercial since they take some time to understand, to feel and to keep. Who has time these days to stop and listen?Listen to this album. These are the Songs for the Haunted Hearts. Makes you remember the beautiful times and how the time has passed you by; trying to forget while remembering too much. Summer's gone and you can't tell why...This album is a summary how simplicity brings the beauty to the front. A rare moment, a chilly feeling and oh what a voice!For an extra treat, there is the Forbidden Color a.k.a ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" from the movie by Sakamoto and Bowie...now including the vocal version for an already beautiful tune!"
5,My favorite Album ever,"I have been a fan of David since the Japan days.I have been lucky enough to see him perform live twice.He is a amazing artist.This collection of songs is perfect.It moves me every time I hear it.I have played it more than any other album I own.And I own upwards of 1000.I bought it on vinyl when it was first released.Then on CD,And again with the remasterd version.If you dont already own this ,do yourself a favor.BUY IT.I suggest the remastered version with promise as the last track,not forbidden colours.The sound quality is much better than the first release."
5,Mournful and peaceful,"Shadows shifting in my peripheral view. Was it movement or just a memory? David Sylvian is a master of words and uses them to paint a picture or mood. The album begins with the piano, strings, voice vehicle ""September"". The music speaks of that dualness of fall which brings beauty in the throngs of decay. It reminds me of the pain of leaving home for college: Both expectant and reluctant.Sylvian's voice is warm and this album wraps it in piano, spanish guitar, strings, upright bass and synthesizers. It is hard to categorize but the word ""tasteful"" comes to mind. The songs deal with good and evil both in the world and in ourselves.This is my favorite album by David Sylvian. Secrets of the Beehive is indeed an album you need to hear."
