5,Very inspirational!,"This book is great for all ages! It sends the message that if you work hard and are dedicated to what you love, anything is possible. My five year old and I read this all the time, it's his favorite! He even has me put salt in his shoes before he goes out to play basketball. I highly recommend this book to any parent. It will give your child an instant boost of confidence."
1,Misleading the Kids,It's a shame that a book purporting to be history is so full of errors. The real story is much more interesting. Too bad the author relied on his imagination instead of doing his homework.
3,Eh....its ok.,"OK this gun is so so. Where to begin. How about with the consCons.-Cheap Plastic-Breaks Easily-Scope Inaccurate-Non-powerfull inaccurate shots-.2 only go about 40 ft.Pros-Low Price (Buy at shortyusa.com Only $20 there)-Magazine looks cool-Fast fire rate-comes with alot of accesoriesOverall i would say dont buy this and either buy the Styer Aug, UTG shotgun, or the new UTG warhawk ak-47."
3,Ya its an ok gun not to good,"I bought the gun but the very first day I tried to put the silencer on but it broke and the muzzle came off, this gun is ok but the plastic is very cheap and breaks very easily,The only good things are all the accecorioes or however u spell it."
1,SUCKS!!!,"i got this gun and i was really excited to shoot it. it shot like 2 feet! it has a fast fire rate, but the plastic it REALLY cheap. i put the silencer on and i acidently hit it on something it it just fell off. the laser didnt work, the scope was really inaccurate, and the flashlight is really weak. GET ANOTHER GUN!"
5,Excellent resource,I don't have much desk space and I really appreciate this quick reference guide. It covers virtually everything needed and is small and fits in my desk drawer for easy access.
5,This book is a must buy!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I liked the mixture of the prose and gospel. Would love to read more from this author- he appears to really have something relevant to say!
3,Thought-Provoking but Frustrating,"Dr. Ellen Brantlinger has done a fascinating case study on the impact of social class on mothers' and teachers' perceptions of government-run education in an economically diverse small Midwestern city (presumably the author's hometown of Bloomington, IN). The book really made me examine how social class has influenced my own beliefs about education.However, I was extremely frustrated by Dr. Brantlinger's assumptions about the underlying reasons behind her subjects' responses. She kept attributing very negative motivations to the upper-middle-class moms without providing any convincing evidence to back up her accusations. Dr. Brantlinger reads classism and a desire to continue social inequality into everything the wealthier moms say, in a way very reminiscent of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson when it comes to racism."
2,Review for Dividing Classes,"Dividing classes reaises many questions regarding how the middle class views school advantage. Through interviews and personal experiences, the author describes her positive and negative experiences with the educational system. We found this book gives rise to many controversial issues some with which we agree as well as some issues we disagree with. While the author does give concrete examples, we believe SES is not the only predictor for educational success."
5,Awsome DVD,"Great selection of scenes, made me appreciate free style skiing like never before. Would recommend any ski enthusiast to purchase this DVD anytime!"
2,Possibly a future headliner. Just haven't gotten it yet.,"The music, although advanced in originality, still posesses that unreformed, rough, local sound that simply must be reworked if N17 ever wants to headline."
5,Classic,I read this book when I was younger it is and will be a pure classic title and door to the imagination for years to come.
3,not bad...,"pros: cute and cheap!cons: cheap is a cheap does; the band bends with the slightest pressure, and the sizing is a little off; i wear a 6 and this ring slides around on my finger."
1,Minor talent,"Fuller is a minor talent of the Transcendentalist movement, marginally interesting for her proto-feminism. (Actually not at all interesting). It is doubtful whether Emerson and Thoreau are not outdated; Fuller is best forgotten."
2,FREEZING UP,"This particular double sided DVD froze up on a couple of occasions per side(movie). Each time I watched both movies, this problem occurred. This problem was noted by another reviewer, which I read, before purchasing this product. Thinking it was an isolated problem, I discovered it is not. Not sure what the problem is, but I am certain the problem does not exist with the DVD player."
4,Great Deal!!,I saw this set at a local Wal-Mart and just had to have it. I loved seeing these movies back in the day. Now for just $10 I have both of them on a single dvd. This is a must own if you like great comedy movies or a fan of Eddie Murphy.
3,Wow,"Well, I read the side effects, and well, I had my own summer from one pill. I am going to take 1/2 of one next time and hope not to be red again. Otherwise, I felt great."
4,Breeder recommended,"No complaints about this food. Our breeder recommended it for our 8 wk old Frenchie and this food seemed good in that Luna ate most of it and her stool was pretty firm. Gas was not a real problem. We switched to Blue Buffalo, which has firmed up her stool a bit more (which I prefer), but no complaints about this food. I just found one that's better for us."
1,corrected review,"A fine product, the suppliers are prompt and honorable persons. When I complained of a bad pump, a new one was sent out promptly, and IT WORKS WONDERFULLY!Please note that I was, unfortunately, unable to change my star rating. Why, I don't know. Most certainly this is a five star oiffer.pepe"
1,Amazon.com is great!,"I got mine from minibox. Well I bought 2 pumps, and one pump had a problem a couple of days after it rained. The power plugs were completely funked and the pump would not work. I could see corosion inside the plastic housing. I am not sure why one would build a solar sytem that is not remotely water resistant but....I emailed minibox via Amazons link and they sent a very poor reply which I then forwarded to Amazon and Amazon refunded my money. I would recommend not going to minibox. The second pump is kind of neat. And seems to work pretty well."
5,Da Bomb,"Even though Mase isn't in the game anymore, he deserves his share of props. This joint with Total is one of the best tracks he has done. I wish everyone would stop hatin' cuz right now he's richer than any one of you reading this."
2,Like glue,This product was like spraying glue in my hair. It gave my curls a very dry/powdery appearance and made them so hard that I could barely separate them. There was not any moisture to the spray and I can't figure out a purpose where I would prefer to use this product at any time - especially with how dull it left my hair looking. It was not for me - curly 3/3b hair.
2,Not my favorite,"I have very thick and curly hair so I'm always looking for good products to control it. A hair stylist told me this was a good product so I tried it. It didn't do much of anything for my hair, it just seemed to make it feel dirty."
4,I like it,"I love the smell of this product and it does keep my curls in place. It IS a bit sticky though, so I usually only use it the day before I'm going to wash my hair anyway."
3,not for fine curls..,I have a lot of really fine curly hair. Its good quality and it seems that it would be great for medium or coarse curls. Its just too heavy for mine.
2,Just made it smell like a lemon,"I really wanted to get behind the Deva products. Ive had my hair cut at their salon and it was amazing. I got the Shampoo, Con, gel, moisture spray, the lot. I found the whole line really heavy and makes my 3B curls look really greasy. I only use the conditioner as a leave in now and again the rest of the stuff is wasting space in my cabinet. The moisture lock just make my hair smell like a lemon. Even though these products are marketed towards all curl types from wavy to kinky I have never seen a lady with 3 or 4 type curls that have been happy with them. So if you can get a Deva cut go for it but skip on the products."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,I was really hoping to love this product. I ordered it and waited patiently (impatiently) for it to arrive because I was beyond excited.However it just didn't do the trick. It makes my hair look greasy and flat. It's almost like it weighs it down. For what I paid for it I am really upset about it. I really wanted to love this!It does smell pretty good though. That's about all the nice things I can say about it.
2,Deva Curl Set it Free,"Really loved this product so I purchased two bottles. The first bottle I used worked fine, however, the second bottle will not spray. The product oozes down the sides of the bottle like a cream making it impossible to use. The price is much too expensive for an unusable product."
5,Best for curly hair,Applying right before hair drying helps the curl to draw up so much better than when not using this product. I love it!
3,Glad it was a sample...,"I got a sample of this with the Deva Fuser. I'm glad I didn't pay for it. It does smell okay, and does give a somewhat more defined look to my curls on days I don't wash my hair, but it also gives a slightly dirty or greasy look. I won't be buying a full bottle of this."
1,Very Boring,This has got to be the most boring game I've ever played. All you do is shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot at a target for several minutes until it blows up. I don't mind shooters but it gets rather tedious when you have to spend so much time on just one target.
4,online gamming,"this game has great online gamming if you buy this game make sure you go to www.mektek.net and download the mekmatch because the microsoft zone doesn't work anymore, With this you can find online servers. Updates are also available there. When most get this game they did not know about mektek and it is hard to play online without it."
2,More than you ever wanted to know about William James,This book has thousands of little details about the life of William James. It also has a bit of psychology and philosophy too! Read it if you have a few hours you want to kill.
1,less than zero stars... pure fakery,"Do some research on this man. (Really, I would hope no one would be viewing this page anyway... but just in case...) you can check this at three ""w's"" dot edresearch dot c followed by o followed by m. Look under ""Hall of Shame."""
5,Written Especially for Me!,"Wow! If I didn't know better, I'd think this AMAZING book was written just for me and my family! I've read other parenting books, but there is something different to THIS one. It's a truly unique perspective that has provided some incredible revelations in parenting. A friend of mine did me the tremendous favor in recommending this book to me, so in turn, I'm doing the same to anyone out there who feels like they need a little bit of help! Cheaper to buy this book, than pay for counseling! (Ha!)"
5,Celtic Review,I belong to a Celt cult since 1972.When I read the book I found a very well documented work on our beliefs and practices.It even helped me understand some things that I didnt comprehend.
2,Buy it for the illustrations,"The text is dreadful, but what can you expect from a book that was written some 200 years ago! There have been a lot of advances in Celtic archaeology since then. But the illustrations which are old steel engravings of the megalithic sites are absolutely worth the price."
3,Not my favorite Fforde,"Overall this was a pleasant enough read. The author makes it obvious to the reader what to expect, but that doesn't take away the charm of the story.I like Fforde's female protagonists because they are a strong bunch - no wilting flower among them.Only thing I would gripe about was that this particular novel went on about 100 pages too long. Otherwise, it was a lovely story about commitment to friendship, evaluating one's self, and being open to possibilities."
4,Informational,"Although this book is not that insightful or research-filled, this provide a very good foundation of tarot knowledge for the beginners. Easy to grasp. Information here is quite abundant too. Recommended for beginners."
5,"a great book, no matter how long you've been studying tarot","This book is great. true, the editing is not the greatest, but the way the author puts all of the information is amazing. she brings in the ideas of the cards from several different decks, which I found helped me in my readings. in addition, she goes in great depth in the explanation of each individual card. which is great if your a beginner. i've read several tarot books, and this one by far, is the easiest to understand. i recommend it to anyone who is beginning or just wants a different point of view on the cards."
5,Great time capsule of American culture,"Magazine was delivered promptly and in good condition. Very satisfied with the seller.As to the magazine, Playboy in the 60's and 70's was a lot more than naked women; some people actually did read the articles. ;-)Zappa *and* Lana Wood! This issue is a real treasure trove!"
1,this are only decorative,i thought i could use them to chop off a tree or slice a apple off some ones head but i guess they are only meant to be put on the wall.or basement.
5,Best Gift I ever gave,I got this for a gift for my sister-in-law. She is getting married and couldn't find a decent planner. She said they were all too expensive or too uppity with alot of stuff that she didn't/couldn't use. This was a perfect find. My SIL has been thanking me for the last 2 months!
2,"interesting, but it was ok","The idea starts out good. A group of strangers meet under weird circumstances and stuck in an elevator.While there they share their memories of the citywide blackout in 1965. It sounded interesting, but it was ok.I did not really like the book and it could not hold my interest even though some of the characters are interestingby themselves."
3,Pretty good buy,"This saw is just light enough to be in the portable catagory, with two people it's easy as pie. The rip fence is very smooth and accurate and will rip to about 15"" on the right hand side(Hitachi could do better here). A few concerns I have on this saw since I've put it through the works: The motor ""spindal assembly"" seems to have abit too much in/out freeplay for me. Secondly the miter guage is too short for much over a 2"" board. This miter guage is great when it is fully in its slot, but very sloppy if miter cutting much over a 2"" wide board. Last is the height of the throat plate-it needs to be shimmed since the work will drop a bit as it is fed through the saw. Affordable but not perfect yet."
3,"Pretty Good, some rough spots","I love this saw but it has a few rough spots. The saw was out of adjustment out of the box in 2 aspects. 1. Squareness of blade to the table and 2. parallel-ness to the miter gauge. I tried to adjust it according to the manual but there was so much thread lock on the adjustment screws it broke my screwdriver and stripped the screw heads...Good points: Powerful, nice compromise in size and weight for a portable, big table. Great Fence. Sturdy stand. Unbelieveable price. Hitachi needs to tighten up the quality at that Taiwan plant and they will have a winner."
3,TABLE SAW,"SAW WAS DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE BECAUSE IT LACKED THE PROPER DIRECTIONS. ADJUSTMENT DIRECTIONS WERE ALSO LACKING. I HAD TO ADJUST EVERYTHING. HOPEFULLY THE SAW WILL PERFORM ADEQUATELY. NICE SIZE TABLE, AND FENCE IS GOOD QUALITY. MITER GROOVE IS SLOPPY. MAYBE THE MAKITA WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER CHOICE! BUT THE PRICE ON THE HITACHI WAS COMPELLING"
2,A disappointment.....,A two- or three-page snapshot of experiences was not what I was expecting from an international cycle-tourer; I've expressed more about memorable COMMUTES than that.
3,Goes good with Vivaldi and other mediocrities,"Both my wife and I approached this book with enthusiasm, and finished it with vague disappointment. Frankly, the stories are good, but the quality of the writing is throroughly mediocre. I kept imagining what a really good writer would do with the situations described in the book, and how much better they could have been handled. I think that the appeal of this book is mostly to bicyclists who are more interested in the story than the quality of the writing."
1,Too Pricey!!!!,"All I have to say about this is, who on earth is going to pay $3,500 for a lousy book about Nintendo DS when all they have to do is get the tech specs from a magazine or Nintendo's website? Honestly! It's just a book!"
4,Moving true story about the horrors of war,I picked this little yellow book up from my church library. It started slow. When the author began recalling events as the war began I was rivotted and wondered what I would do her in circumstances. My mom lived through similar circumstances and I appreciated getting more information from Nettie's book.
3,Noisy fan,"I just bought this, so I'm not sure of the durability issues, but it is kind of noisy; more so than regular fans that I've used."
3,"Silent, But Not Powerful","This fan is whisper quiet, but should only be used in smaller room. The fan is almost silent, but I barely feel any ""wind"" that can reach parts of the room not directly near the fan. I wanted a fan with ooomf, but could get the job done. I picked this fan because of the recommendations about how it was quiet, but powerful. I end up having to put out another desktop fan in order to get a room cool. Honestly, I'd rather have a noisy fan that works."
2,Lasko 4820 Xtra Air Tower Fan w/ ionizer Quits after only 5 months,"We were excited to get this quiet-running Lasko fan w/ionizer for only about $70 last year, but the fan, which was plugged in and running on low for 12 hours a day, quit working after only 5 months! Since this fan replaced a 20-year old floor model that was much too noisy even running on low, we were quite disappointed (appalled, frankly) that the Lasko 4820 did not last even a year. We don't plan on investing in any more Lasko products after this bad experience."
4,Nice fan,I like this fan because it is very quiet. I wish it blew a little harder but guess that's a small price to pay for the quiet. It blows well enough though and it appears to be sturdy.
5,Works GREAT for Us!!!!!!!!!!!,"We purchased our fans from Sam's about 6 years ago. Our bedroom did not get a good share of the Heat and Air from our Unit, so we purchased this fan due to not having much room for it to sit and liked the Demo unit at Sam's. We purchased this fan and it ran 24/7 for about 6 years, it finally quit after we had power surge. I scrambled trying to find another one of these fans. I purchased one replacement from Amazon and another from another vendor when the Amazon vendor sold out.I have to admit I am amazed at the problems that others are having with their units, we have had NONE. I also hope those that had problems are able to get their units replaced. Mike"
2,Durability....NOT ! !,"Bought my first Lasko Tower Fan a few years ago and really liked it.......so much that I bought a few more since we have use for them. Yesterday however, I noticed that the ""oscellation"" feature stopped working. Called LASKO'S customer service looking for an authorized service center just to find out how much it would cost to repair and to see if it would be cost effective to repair. The customer service (no service??)lady told me that there were ""no repairable parts"" offered to repair the oscellation feature nor are there any authorized service centers available for this fan...........in other words it should be considered a DISPOSABLE fan after a year (my opinion). Remember when fan's used to last longer than a year?? Aside from the fact that the fan is quiet and takes up little space.......DURABILY LEAVES ALOT TO BE DESIRED ! ! !"
2,not what i expected,"i expected better durability out of this fan. It died after just 3 months, and had flow problems from day one. I tried contacting Lasko but got no responses."
2,Nice but not durable,This fan has nice features and operates very quietly. Seems to be a durability issue with most reviews I've read because mine only made it nine months before konking out.
1,I thought this was the best fan ever!,"I thought this was the best fan ever! Now 10 months after purchase it sits waiting to be picked up as garbage. It just stopped working, no warning... no noises... nothing. Customer service says they do not have service for these because they come from overseas already assembled. Of course the replacement warranty is good for a year, only if you still have the receipt. I will never purchase a Lasko again. Just goes to show ya, all that glitters ain't gold!"
1,Fails quickly,Very disappointed with this fan. Failed within six months of purchasing. Don't buy a Lasko fan!
2,"I Solved the Rattle ... well, not really ...","Turning the unit upside-down and precariously balancing it against a bookshelfmiraculously stopped the Geiger-counter rattling noise.Not sure my wife is going to go for the aesthetics, though.Seriously, Lasko, either manufacture this thing a little better or don't make itat all, please."
2,Hardly memorable..,"""Hardly Working"" by Betsy Burke centered around Dinah, who worked as a PR person for a non-profit organization focusing on environmental issues in Vancouver. Fresh from a recent breakup, Dinah was eager to start a new relationship with Ian Trutch, her new boss who was set by the headquarters to manage the Vancouver office. In midst of all this, Dinah was eager to find out more about her biological father as her mother raised her alone and she was never allowed to ask any questions regarding her father. Soon, Dinah discovered that Ian wasn't who he said he was.This was not a very good chick-lit as there was never a strong storyline. The author focused on too many things and none of it was fully developed. It was hard to be engaged as a reader and I never had the urgency to keep on reading. There are definitely better books in this genre out there."
4,Hardly Working,"Betsy Burke works for an environmental agency doing PR work and soliciting donations. She has just turned thirty, and besides her eccentric mother and ongoing search for her father, is living life pretty happily, until the announcement that the new CEO is coming to check out the office and rumours are flying about layoffs. It has the entire office worried and anxious to meet the boss...the only thing is, no one counted on him being so handsome. Sparks fly between Betsy and him, but will this save her job? And is he everything he says he is?This was a quick, entertaining read. I liked the fact that it had a little more of a storyline than some of the other Red Dress Ink novels I have read. I loved that it is based in Vancouver, B.C. and mentions familiar landmarks. A great book to curl up with for the weekend!"
4,A fun and witty romp!,"I thouroughly enjoyed this book. Ms Burke has a witty and sacastic view of office dynamics, and if you work in an office you can sure relate to Dinah. The back stabbing, gossip, inuendo and inappropriate office affairs are entertaining and funny."
5,Hardly Working is Betsy Burke's best novel to date...,"I think this is Betsy Burke's bet book yet. A sarcastic view of the world of not for profit. I enjoyed the inner office dynamics and characters, every office seems to have at least one of the characters in Ms. Burke's book. I enjoyed the eco-conscious info that weaves through the storyline, makes for a different kind of romance and you will no doubt enjoy the outcome."
2,choice of flashgun,"Having played around with photography for 20 years now I am baffled by Vivitar.They produce the 283 flashgun (a good product). Then they produce the 285 with almost the same specs.Except the 283 trigger voltage is over 300 volts and the 285 is 8 volts. Ok if used on the old SLR`s.But what about digital cameras? There are users asking what flashgun can I use on my Fuji 4900 and 6900? I go faint at the thought of putting a 283 on my Fuji 4900. No information is given in the instruction book. So i must conclude with the old saying ""Buyer beware"""
3,Not over the top,"With this book you can get a good idea of the warm ranges of wall colors that create a Tuscan mood. This book focuses more on color and neutral tones as opposed to some that go for the white tones. The decor shown is generally not over the top and focused on the grandiose villas that are out of reach of most everyone. There are many modest but lovely homes shown and you can pull fabric inspiration and accessory inspiration. I would give the book 3.5 stars due to some of the rooms being a bit sparse in design and lacking in real life things such as television/stereos, etc. That however is typical of most design books."
3,Transports you to another place and time,"This was not the book for me because we are building a Tuscan style house and the houses featured in this book are beautiful, but old and refurbished houses in Tuscany. So many of the materials are not available in America, and also there is the comfort issue; while the houses are beautiful and definitely authentic, they might not be so comfortable for today's lifestyle. If you are looking for ideas on a modern Tuscan style house, I definitely recommendTuscan & Andalusian Reflections. However, if what you want is to see is the real, authentic, Tuscan refurbished houses, then this is the book for you.I must say the decoration ideas are great, and the pictures are beautiful. Even though it wasn't what I expected, I don't regret buying it because it definitely transports you to another place and time when you flip through it."
2,PRIVATE TUSCANY,I WAS LOOKING FOR A GRANDER INSPERATION AND IT WAS NOT THERE. SOME NICE SHOTS BUT NOT WORTH BUYING.
1,Disappointed in this book,"I got this book because I'm getting ready to study a few women of the Bible. I was greatly disappointed and had to stop ready when I looked up Ruth. The first sentence states that Ruth is probably a work of FICTION! Excuse me, but why are you presenting a book on the BIBLE and state anywhere in your book that any part of the BIBLE is FICTION? I had to shut the book and it will be returned. I'm shocked there are only 5 star reviews stating how great this book is for learning about the women when it states that the Bible is Fiction. My mind can not grasp this. The Bible is God - Breath Word of God. Period."
5,"Trust me, it's the best fantasy series you ever read!!!","This fantasy series is the best fantasy series I ever read. I introduced it to my friends whenever possible, and they all agree with me.This first book is about how the almost annihalated race strugged to survive and how the daughter of the star-crosses lovers( the star-crossed lovers were the cause of the almost exisitence race:Cheysuli) struggles to fulfill an ancient prophecy she desperately wants to refuse......You would love this book, and after this book, you would want to finish the whole series!!!Get the book now"
1,Worst fantasy I've ever read,"Do you want a story with one-dimensional characters who behave in stupid and irrational ways, and on the whole have zero credibility and no depth? When you look for a book,do you choose the one with the most cliches per page?If the answer is yes, buy this book.Otherwise, stay away from it."
1,Worst Fantasy novel I have ever read,"This should be more appropriately be shelved in the Romance section, because that is what it continually reminded me of. The gushing prose and melodrama was suffocating. The strong female protagonist was simple and irritating (compare her to Kerowyn, from By The Sword by Mercedes Lackey), and none of the male characters were likeable. I seriously started to expect that every male character in the book (including her FATHER and the ANIMALS) to try to force her to have sex with them! I struggled through this book because a friend recommended it to me. If you love Mercedes Lackey, Patricia McKillip, or even Anne McCafrey, stay away from Roberson. Stick with the best."
2,what a rip off,"Look, it's a painters pole. Buy one at your favorite hardware store for half as much. There is no magic thing that makes it a squid pole."
1,Not as described,"I got this chair two years ago. It's not made of leather as it is described. It's made of vinyl, which has cracked on the seat of the chair at two corners. There was no warranty information included either. The chair is not worth the price."
5,Pure genius,An absolute MUST recording for the lover of Lute and traditional Scottish music. One of my most played CDs. Rob can only be described as a master of his instruments. He plays with incredible sensitivity and feeling in this recording. His technical ability is equal with the worlds finest Lutenists and he brings the music to life with his obvious passion for the Scottish repertoire.The technical quality of this recording is brilliant also.
4,The Mystery of the Hidden Beach,"Camp Coral in Key West, Florida, is a happy vacation site for the Aldens and their new cousin, Soo Lee, but the Boxcar Children must investigate when a precious coral bed is destroyed on a nearby island. Can the Boxcar children come to the rescue?"
5,Ben Weider delivers ground-breaking evidence!,"Napoleon: The Man Who Shaped Europe by Ben Weider helped me understand Napoleon better than any other book. It is so clearly written and very compelling, I just couldn't put it down. Numerous biographies of Napoleon are available, but this work is the most straightforward, convincing biography I've ever read. Napoleon Bonaparte's character and achievements have always divided critics and commentators, but in this new book by Ben Weider, I felt I have ""met"" a Napoleon that is totally different from all the other books I've read. Weider has established his credentials as one of the most evocative of popular historians. It's a must read!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a terrible item. We ordered it for our daughter and while you can record your own voice, it never plays back when the alarms are set. The volume is very erratic and half the time the alarm doesn't go off when it is supposed to. We have returned it."
2,Tiny Buki Brush is a Bust!!!,This brush is so tiny it's like holding a starburst in your fingers. You can barely get a grip on it. It's not worth the money in that department. It does work but you'll drop it many times after you've loaded it. I'd advise buying one with a long handle to hold on to. This is useless.
2,Feeling Cheated,"I was very disappointed with Navigation Volume 2 (I never read Vol 1). The sites chosen for review were obviously chosen because they were artistic and ""cool"", and not because of their stellar Navigation. Most of the sites reviewed were Flash based sites with confusing navigation that breaks many of the basic rules. These types of navigation are great if you only have 10 pieces of content on your entire site but if you have any real amount of content and your users need a logical way to get around your site then this is not the book for you. Also there's no explanations in the book so you have very little idea why they chose that navigation and what it might be good for. This book is just pretty to look through but has no substance, it will surely collect dust on my shelf."
1,"Sad, very sad","Navigation? I don't think so. This is just a collection of graphic ideas. There is no ""navigation"" inspiration here. In fact this series is a let down. 75% of the images are an exact duplicate from the Splashpage book in the series. These guys from Rockport are trying to make a quick book with slick images. There has to be something better out there."
3,Good Easy reading,I agree that this book is good reading for anyone who wants to find a easy book to read this is the book. The book is basically about a young girl who tells her about what happens to her one summer. The girl is spending the summer with her family and having fun but she tells about the abuse her father puts her through this summer by using different poems and literary elements.The author describes wat she goes through by talking about it and describing it as if she is swimming.This is a great book if you are looking for an easy book to read and something you can finish in less than an hour and that will keep you interested in the book.Enkosi
2,Learning to Swim,Learning to Swim is a book written in a poem about the author being sexually abused as a child while on vacation. The main idea the book tries to convey is that when something bad like that happens to a person holding it in doesn't help. It eats away inside of you like a cancer and gets worse and worse. And even though it hurts to tell someone about it you'll feel better in the end. The book itself is extremely short and can be read in 20 minutes. I did not find the book very entertaining or enjoyable to read. I believe it is meant for people who have been sexually abused and to make them feel better and give them confidence to let someone know what happened to them.
4,A World's Lesson,"The conflict that arises in these poems is one that the world must come to grasps with as a problem. When it happens, most people try to hide it because they feel ashamed, but Learning to Swim shows how abuse is not something to be ashamed of, and that you should seek help if it happens to you. No one wants to hear about sexual abuse, especially when it happens to children, but this story remarkably shows how it can be overcome, even by a small child, and how she moved on and was able to learn from her horrible experience."
5,One Secret the Ruins the Whole Summer,"""Learing To Swim"" was an exellent book written by Ann Turner. Would you be able to deal with a secret that you couldn't tell any one about or it would happen again? Just this one secret ruined Annie's whole summer. Annie was afraid to do any thing because she thought it would happen again. She was afaid to go swiming. She was afraid she would go under. She needs to tell someone so she can overcome her fears and so that she can stay afloat and start breathing again. This book is great for young teens to learn to say no."
4,Not quite the condition I expected,"The shipping was kinda slow, the communication wasn't that great, and the book wasn't in that great of condition. Lots of highlighting. However, to have gotten a textbook I needed for such a good price, somewhat makes up for that...not completely but somewhat."
1,Not A Satisfy Customer,"I must say that I am very upset with purchasing an item that was never shipped to me. I filed a complaint with Amazon and have yet to here from them. Very disappointed. I would like the full amount of my money back, I do not have money to throw away and if this is how Amazon threat its customer, I will never purchase anything from Amazon again."
1,Stupid...nice concept but doesn't work,I bought six of these for stocking stuffers. I kept one for myself. I tried using it and didn't work. The product didn't have any suction and only made noises with a really nasty smell coming out. Cool concept but it needs to work in order for people to buy it!
3,lighter,It was lighter than expected. I really like the rack. Was The first time I use it. I had a really old roast that my mother gave to me over thrity years ago. Love it but it finally burned though.
3,Size,A little too small for a big turkey. I expected it to be much bigger. Other than that it is fine.
2,great pan losy rack,On recieving my pan all looked good..my turkey came out fine..but opon cleanup.found rack coating had melted and stuck to pan. Looked like someone had cut a big groove in pan...afraid to use it again
4,Replacement roaster (with Rack) rocks!,"Thank you for the replacement roaster. I had to return the first one I received, but the return was quick and easy. UPS showed up at the door with a mailing label, and within a few days, the new roaster was delivered. It's perfect, and I can't wait for another holiday meal to use it again!"
1,"calphalon 16"" roaster","this product absolutely sucks. i own alot of calphalon that was made in the usa which i love, but this particular item is made in china, and the quality control is abysmal."
5,Great item,"Like all calphalon products, it does what it is made to do. Cook the Turkey. It got the job done. And cleaned up nice."
5,roast pan,"Pan well worth the money. Bought it because i really like the hard anodized and really dislike non-stick interiors. Well, this has no non-stick, so exactly what looking for. Did a 19# turkey for Thanksgiving. Even tho not a non-stick, the interior cleaned up with no effort. And we had some burned on vegatables on the bottom as our broth boiled off. Even so, soaked it a few hours, and went to clean. Just used a Dobbie pad and Dawn, cleaned up real quick. Was impressed. Also rosted 6# of brisket in it the other week. Again, cleaned up real nice and brisket cooked in a shorter time. So even tho $60, well worth the extra money from the cheap pans out there. Definitely get what you pay for. Problem with the cheap non-sticks is eventually the non-stick comes off. So in long run a waste of money. I know, this pan replaced one of those cheaper non-sticks. Should have bought this the first time around."
5,Good for DeGlazing,"This is an excellent roasting pan of high quality. It will hold a large turkey. If you like to deglaze for gravies, etc, this is the pan. The rack is non-stick and cleans up easily. If you don't do gravies, go for the non-stick version for easy clean-up."
2,Great size; cheap both the price and quality,"Not going to waste too much time on this review. I've had two of these; both roasting pans have been recycled.Its a great roaster for a large turkey or a large/mid size roast with lots of roots & veggies to completely cover the bottom. However, the metal is extremely thin and will warp at higher roasting temps or if the roaster is lightly loaded, so use caution or you won't be pleased with the pan's transformation.Again, its great for turkey day and I'll probably buy a third if a sale price makes it hard to pass up. This one would be reserved strickly for big birds and large roasts that won't fit into my higher quality, albeit smaller roasters.The non-stick rack is phenomenal; I have two :)"
5,GREAT Pan!!,I love this pan. I've cooked one chicken and two turkeys in it in the little time I've had it. It's not non-stick but cleans up like it is. A little warm water and it's brand new again. Easy. The handles turn in so it's easy to store. I use the pan without the rack to defrost the turkeys (little hint there). Well worth the money!
1,"Save your money, buy a slingshot - you'll have better luck scaring away pests with that!",I bought a few of these units to scare away racoons from my pond. They suck! The racoons are laughing at me for wasting my hard earned cash! I wish I would have spent the money on beer so I could at least be drunk when the racoons are killling my exspensive Koi!
2,Just ok.,Didn't keep any animals away from my garbage. I thought I would test it on my cat and instead of keeping it away it attracted my cat.
3,Hit and Miss,"I bought two Animal Aways to keep raccoons away from my koi pond. So far (about a week), the raccoons have not returned, but I cannot say for certain if that is due to the product or something else. I have two cats and did try it out on them. One of them was unaffacted and started to rub her nose on it, and the other ran away from me whenever I appoached him holding it. Strangely enough, I can hear the high frequency tone myself. It is very irritating and hurts my ears after a few minutes, so I know that the product is working and emitting the tone. I am not sure why one cat was deterred by it and the other one not, but for the relatively small price, I think it is worth trying."
2,miss advertized,"Carfull of this ad, misleading... will not repell rodents.Wait for battery operated unit with higher hertz to come out."
4,Bye Bye Kitty,"I purchased three of these to keep the neighborhood cats out of my yard. Since then, I have had very little problem with unwanted guests. They worked so well, my dad purchased three to keep feral cats in his neighborhood out of the yard. As long as you keep the batteries fresh, they will work quite nicely."
2,Electronic dog deterrer,"Bought this item based on ratings and did not have any success. May have gotten a defective unit, so I sent it back and got a full refund. Nice package, and seems to work well for others who bought it."
2,"Review of ""Animal Away"" motion activated alarm","Item arived snail-mail within week to 10 days. Mounted it on a post about 12 inches off ground pointed toward flower bed & fence. The alarm works when walking in front of it and from about 40 feet away. It sounds a high pitch tone that I can hear,but it has no effect on the squirels. They just look & continue to eat the flowers on the Hibiscus.They can sit 5 feet away from it in the yard & not be bothered. Our dog just wants to sniff it when held with the activation on. The smoke-alarm creates more fear & she wants to go hid under the table. She will not venture back upstairs for fear. Save your money."
2,P7810 Animal Away,The product worked OK but the working distance was not enough to stop my dog from going beyond the boarder. Plus the sonic sound had no effect on my dog.
1,WROTHLESS!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"My dogs loved walking up to and sniffing this box, what a piece of junk. Don't waste your time on this, you WILL be disappointed!!!"
1,animal stay detector,I tested this product out on my own animals and they all stayed put to see what I had in my hand . I also placed it near their beds and they slept as before. I did make sure it was on and the red light was on . Now maybe I got a defected unit or all the people who said this thing works are defected ! Jimmer of shy-town
1,Waste of money,"After installing this product I disappointingly watched cats, dogs, birds, and squirrels play around it in my yard with NO effect. The red light turns on when it senses motion, so it is ""working"" - or at least it has power. The animals walk right past it, I see the sensor light turn on, and their ears do not even twitch.This is a waste of money and time. Do NOT purchase, it has no effect on any small animal."
1,Don't waste your money.,Tried this product for several weeks to discourage dogs from peeing on my grass. I saw no reaction and there was no improvement to the problem.
4,No More Stray Cats!,"Since using the Animal Away, we haven't had the problems of stray cats in our yard. :) Hooray! I'm happy to say that the Animal Away is 'bird friendly' and doesn't disturb the wildbirds that I feed. It does seem to require fresh batteries approximately every month, but as long as it keeps the strays away, I'm happy!"
3,Very Effective,"I've found this repeller to be very effective on dogs. I live near a park so lots of dogs pass by my yard and this repeller makes sure they don't leave a deposit for me to clean up! I've found this repeller to be highly resistant to rain, snow, and cold - it keeps functioning no matter what. The only downside (and it's kind of a big one) is that the batteries die very quickly. You're lucky to get 4 days out of a fresh battery! Since this unit needs the most costly battery - 9 volt - that can get pretty expensive! So, I've had to take this one down because the operating cost is prohibitive. It's too bad really, it's a great repeller but it's just too expensive to run!"
2,Not effective,"A neighbor has ""adopted"" 26 feral cats. I admire their commitment. I attract song birds with a feeder and the cats want to supplement their diet with the birds.I got the ""P3 International P7810 Cordless Motion Activated Animal Away"" to keep the cats away from the bird feeder. The cats can hear the unit, they stop when the enter the coverage area and look directly at the unit. However, they continue without any concern for the unit. Perhaps, if the unit emitted a stronger signal (higher dB) the unit could be effective. Gave the high 2 star rating only because the cats can hear the unit !!!"
2,Try something else,"I don't know about all the animals that come in the yard, but the dog that I was aiming for just walks right by it. Might give it a glance. I've trapped Raccons and ""possums"" so evidently it doesn't bother them either. (with new battery). I put a sprinkler on a timer at the entrance of backyard. Pretty good!"
1,Animal Away Detector,This product was absolutely worthless. It deterred no animals away from our bird feeder. I watched as the raccoon emptied the bird feeder without being bothered in the slightest by the detector.
1,Disappointed,"I had two of these, one at the bottom of the stairs to my 2nd floor deck and one on the deck and the cats just walked right past them and left their calling cards on my deck. I was so hoping they would work, but they didn't."
1,Did not work for me,I bought this to help with stray cats thinking my yard is their dumping ground. It didnt do anything. They still come across and do their thing. I pointed it directly at the cats (1-2 ft away) and they just sit there and smile.
3,Not sure yet..,I bought two of them to stop cats climbing my car's hood.I tried them for sometime but I'm not sure if they are really having effect on cats.
3,Nice but loud,This could be a very nice book for my son BUT.. its very loud. The only way this wouldn't mess up your child's ears if you place duct tape over speaker.I also don't like how bulky it is.3 stars only because pictures are bright and interesting to a child's eye.
2,Would have liked more info,"The DVD's work but the main language is french, which I don't speak. Because of our DVD setup it won't allow me to select anything but french. I would have liked to have known that the main language was french before purchasing. It would work fine at if your DVD player selection options works, but our DVD player doesn't allow that...Anyone else would have been fine with it although the cover is in French as well."
2,mistakenly purchased videos and not books,"I am writing aout the TIN TIN purchases and I'm actually glad to have this opportunity be able to write a review. Actually, I bought two sets, part 1-5 and 6-10. The purchases of these sets was a great mistake because I didn't know that they were dvds, and not books. One set I could return, but the other set I could not return and I am not sure what to do with it. Not only are they videos, further, they are in FRENCH. There was not an opportunity to return the set though, I would have liked to, and I still would like to. I looked for a return address on the label but there was none. CAN YOU PROVIDE ME WITH THIS ADDRESS and/or telephone number?Admittedly this may have been my fault for seeing these sets and assuming they were books -- again, I did not think videos. But unlike other purchases I have made through Amazon, I couldn't find the address or the way to return this second set..Thanks. Loren"
4,Love it,I love tin tin! Will order some more soon! Just like it suppose to be. Wish it could have been cheaper!
5,Must Have!,"Alright if their was a rating over 5 it would be higher! I'm 13 years old and is thinking of becoming a magician, like Criss Angel and David Blaine, i baught this deck and used them for almost all my tricks, there smooth and fan out perfectly almost every time,the turnoffs though is that when you keep it in the deck for a little too long they get sticky-ishand if your a person who wants to perfom magic in a funny or comedic point of view i DONT recomend this deck, these cards look far too serious and reek artwork (that ace of spades rules!!!!)-also sometimes because the cards look very different peole get suspicious and think its a tricke dout deckother than that, this deck freakin rules and, amazes people just by LOOKING at them"
3,"Good product, bad finish","The product page says Air-flow finish, but I got one that is the aircushion finish, the deck is still awesome but it wears out a faster."
5,Inspiring and beautiful!,"I'm normally not one to write reviews, but I happened to read the mean-spirited review below and I had to respond. I recently purchased this album and have enjoyed it thoroughly. I am also a classical musician, as the former reviewer was so careful to proclaim, although I can't brag about hearing every voice on the market today (is that even possible?). What I loved about this CD was the variety of repertoire and the fact that it was obviously recorded live. It gives me the feeling of being present at an intimate vocal recital. I especially like the Wolf songs and the Ravel ""Kaddish."" Serious art music is not for everyone, but those who are looking for a taste of what a lovely, rich, expressive voice can offer will not be disappointed."
1,I want my money back,"I bought this CD for the recording of the hard-to-find ""Cantata of Spirituals"" by John Carter, but I was disappointed to find that they were poorly done. I've listened to every great voice on the market today, being a classical musician myself, and this singer does not deserve a place among the greats based on this recording. I had faith in the reviewers who wrote glowing comments about her versatility and beauty of tone--but I have to completely disagree with them after listening."
3,unfocused,"Mary maddux' voice is pleasant enough but I find that the monologue does not aide me in focusing or ignoring outside distractions. At one point in the monologue she giggles. I am always waiting for the giggle knowing that the session will be over soon. The music is very much in the background, sometimes inaudible so definitely not a distraction."
1,Something is wrong,"I rarely cry 'wolf' but...I ordered this product, it came in without the part that holds the MP3...so it is useless (they shipped the 809-TS). I called Customer Service who overnighted another complete package although I advised it was just missing the one part (it was the only way they could do it). Just got the replacement - same thing... The window mount itself is heavy duty - it will be nice if they can get me the rest of the unit.... or determine it wasn't supposed to come with that part? Then they need to also fix the description and the image."
5,I Spy Once Again,I bought this as a gift for a man who loves The Cosby Show and loves Bill Cosby. He had never heard of the show and enjoyed it very much. He was pleased that I gave it to him.
5,I didn't even know it was in color.,"I guess I always watched I SPY on a black and white TV. Good stories well done. Culp and Cosby ""clicked"". Episode after episode they just got better. Boy, these are fun to watch."
3,A Wish For All I Spy Fans!,"This is called box set 1. Box set 1 is a random collection of episodes from any given season. What I would like to see is 'I Spy-The Complete First Season'. I would like THAT box set to have a lot of bells & whistles--outtakes, commercials for the show, interviews (recent and from the era), tv guide covers and articles from everywhere!"
5,great set,This is a great set. A must own for classic tv fans. I havent seen it since the early days of Nick at Nite about 2o years ago
3,Two Hip Spies,"Younger audiences may only know Bill Cosby from ""The Cosby Show"" and Robert Culp from ""The Greatest American Hero"", but this is the show that set them on their way. This series had the distinction of not only being the first action/drama series one to have an African-American in a prominent starring role, but it also was one of the most expensive shows to produce. Why? They filmed on location around the world. One of the coolest spy shows from the 1960s."
4,"I Spy, the Classic series","I love this show. I can't tell you how much. I remember seeing this when I was little and my mom watched it all the time, and I remember sort of liking it, but after having gotten the first box set and watching the shows myself I'm floored by how good this show was. Robert Culp and Bill Cosby are a pleasure to watch.The DVD's themselves are not all that amazing. Just the shows, no real extras, and the menus aren't the best in the world. The DVD cases are very thin and don't contain anything other than the DVD itself. I would recommend this if you enjoy the show, or you just like spy movies with dry humor, cause that's what this is."
3,nostalgic,"Way back then I couldn't wait for the next episode, so it's kinda fun going back to that age of TV."
1,bad dvds,"DO NOT but this series! I wish to tell you that after 2 viewings I went to view them a 3rd time and the entire series of dvds, 24 of them, are trashed! All my other dvds stored in same location are fine, these have numerous dropouts on the video and soundtrack making them unviewable. Amazon will not stand behind this product, nor will they accept returns on them, as I purchased them 2 years ago (and had no desire to watch them a 3rd time until recently). Apparently I think it is the painting on the surface of the viewable side of the dvds that causes this, but I am no expert. They indicated try to contact the manufacturer, which is a non-answer to the max!"
2,Not what I remember...,"As many of you who have bought this product or are considering it, I was born in the early 50's and remember television through the 60's very fondly. I remember this show as being exciting and very visual. I liked both stars a lot back then. However, times change. I have purchased many dvd collections of shows from this period and I have to say this about the most boring of them all. I am sure it is both the fault of romantic notions of the time and being exposed to better programs over time. Nice locations, but very mundane scripts and stories you can write the ending to after two minutes. So, my advice is if you think you liked this and want to revisit it, do so with caution--buy Burke's Law, Route 66 or Honey West instead."
4,"Awesome, but could be better","I used this book to succesfully complete ""Thunderscape"", however it could have been a little more explanatory. There were a few things I had to figure out on my own and was dissapointed that their were no ""illegal"" cheats. The maps were also *very* useful."
4,Striking Gold,"Discovered White Gold, and its author in perusal of nonfiction reviews on Goodreads ; I'm glad that I did. This author writes much like E. Larson - hunting & digging up lost details of history (as well as its forgotten & lesser known players) twisting & weaving these historical threads into a fascinating recounting which might appear more fiction (in its ease of style) than fact.Go for it! I have already added Milton's other nonfiction to my 'to read' list; now, if only I might determine which to read 1st. :)"
5,History and Adventure,The others who rated this well describe this book well enough. All I would add is that someone should make this a movie. It's another example of real life being more interesting than fiction ever could be.
3,"White slaves, muslim cruelty","It is obviously an important story and much needed of getting out there to the general reader. However the book relies too much on the almost day by day routine and hardships suffered by Thomas Pellow, the main character. The book would be excellent if it only had 100 odd pages. But after a while it's just more of the same arrogance and torture inflicted by that muslim buffoon on his victims.I think the author could well have summarized the story's main ideas and expanded a little on the sociological background of the times, the context and so forth. So much blood and guts spilled over the pages gives if a feel of exaggeration, and this story is no joke. It deserves a much serious treatment.Each nation pays for its own sins, just like any person. Sic transit muslim nations. Long live England."
4,History Repeats - Islamic Extremists,"This is an amazingly interesting book. I couldn't put it down. Myself and many of my friends had no idea this was a part of European/Islamic history. Some feel this isn't for the faint hearted.One reviewer wrote, ""Does this sound uncomfortably familiar? Like some Islamic extremists of today, the Sultans laughed about holding Europe to ransom. They were rarely met with force."" History does indeed repeat itself."
5,Historical Account,"Having heard of this book from friends, I checked it out before purchase as there are nowadays many examples of history being rewritten for what might be termed ""politially correct"" reasons.Indeed this book may soon be unavailable due to those reasons. It could be construed that this account of slavery might cause offense to Muslims, though none of the Muslims I know personally would be so offended. But one of the motivations for me to buy this book was the ""review"" by the (Islamic?) correspondent of the Washington Post, which you kindly reproduce. Viewing this distainful dismissal was for me most revealing and may (I hope) encourage others to make this purchase also.They will be rewarded by an account of a period of history which is being quietly swept under the carpet and out of sight."
4,"IMPROVED,GREAT GAME!","THIS IS MY FAVORITE OUT OF ALL THE WWTBAM GAMES,SOME PROBLEMS...QUESTIONS REPEAT A LITTLE TOO MUCH,AND 30 SECOND TIME LIMIT FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS YET?! WELL,STILL A GREAT GAME. I GIVE IT A 4 OUT OF 5!"
3,Don't stress over your final answer,"Millionaire 2nd Edition is a quality game if you've got several people and have some free time. It's not terribly thrilling, especially if you are playing alone. If you have got a group of people playing, it tends to move a bit faster. The graphics and sounds of Regis are incredible and the game is definitely a challenge. You'll probably use up all your lifelines by the time you've reached the $8000 level. If you plan on playing with a group of people, go for it, but if you're looking for a fun game to pass the time, look elsewhere."
3,"It's ok, but not great","This game is ok. The questions are not exciting at all. I was really disapointed that regis did not read the questions to you. And i got annoyed at all the ranamized sayings he would spit out, that dint match up to the situation at times. They also put a 60 second time limit on each question. The lifelines work pritty good. For basic trivia players and regis lovers this is fine."
3,"Fun, but could be better","Let's think about experience for a moment. Are we trying to give the customer an experience in the hot seat, or are we just trying to push out a trivia game with Regis' face on it just to make a buck?This game does not flow like the TV show at all. Regis doesn't ask the questions, the 30-second timer is obnoxious, and the pauses between every question for a comment from Regis get tiresome... especially during the first 5 questions that are supposed to be quick and easy. (emphasis on easy)The game is not without merit, though. The phone conversations are sometimes humorous to listen to, maybe a bit overdone and Regis' wise-cracks when you lose are appropo. Aside from the first 5 questions, the pace of the game is about right.However, when trivia games like ""You Don't Know JACK"" do an excellent job of putting me in the hot seat, then I would tend to expect more from a game that carries the name ""Millionaire""."
2,Trite questions,"For true trivia buffs, this game is not worth it. The questions are pretty standard, and not interesting at all. This is a problem with any game or book that has a large number of questions. The only book that I have found that rises above this level of mediocrity is ""Quizzing."" I found this book truly entertaining and interesting, and a must-read for trivia freaks."
3,Great Experience -- Content Lacking,"This game does as well as it can to replicate the TV experience. Regis' voice and videos, lifelines just as on the show, the whole works. But you'd better enjoy it, because the ""replay value"" is minimal. There are only about 600 questions here, and that means that after about 20 games, you will be seeing a lot of repeat questions, enough to really spoil the fun.On a CD there should be room for many thousands of questions. But the use of audio files for the ""phone-a-friend"" lifeline likely eats up a lot of the available space. If they were all authentic, some people might judge it worthwhile. But most of them seem to be the silly ""psychic hotline"" responses, and these are definitely not worth it.At ..., it still makes sense for fans of the show to give this a shot -- just be aware that you'll only get a week or two of enjoyment out of it. If you want a larger database of questions, consider the board game at ..., which *does* have several thousand questions."
1,It totally sucks,"I bought this game thinking that it would be better than the first one (Which was really bad). It turned out to be the exact same thing! The only difference was different questions! Dont be fooled by those-""New and better than ever!"" signs. I would say ""New and suckier than ever!"" The questions are alot harder in the game than on TV (Which you would think that it would be easier on the video game because its not real money).Any ways I would say if you liked the first one you'll like this but other wise DONT BUY IT! Regis also is very annoying in this game. Enough negetive stuff-you know my point. I wouldn't recamend this at all."
1,Awful!,"The questions are IMPOSSIBLE to answer - especially with the stupid time limit (which, correct me if I'm wrong, ISN'T on the show) -- The first $100 question I was asked was which popular singer is referred to as the Chairman of the Board...Silly questions - WAY to hard to answer... stupid game. And Regis Philbin is the most annoying man alive!"
2,REGIS YOUR A IDIOT,this is a boring game where all the questions are just repeated over and over. every time you get a answer you hear regises dumb voice making som idiotic comment. IT is ok the first couple of times you play it but after that it gets really boring. You would be better of playing it at a friends house or renting it or somthing but deffinately dont buy it.
1,Didn't Work on My Windows XP,"I ordered this game because it said it was for Windows XP. However, it didn't work on my computer. I order programs and games that say they will work with Windows XP but this one didn't. If you have Windows XP - think twice before ordering it."
3,"Throwing a party? Otherwise, eww..","As the title says, this game is stupid alone. However, as a party game, it's awesome. I played it with 8 other people and it was really intense and fun. I bought it myself and returned it the next day- it just wasnt worth it."
3,An Improvement,This is the second installment of Who Whant To Be A Millionare. And it it is better in many ways. First of all I see the creators have found their mistake in the 1st edition so they added a ton of question so that it will probally wont repeat. They also have improved the graphics Regis looks better. But this game still has its flaws. For one the questions are to hard I still haven't won the million. Regis still says the same thing over and over. They still didn't do anything to improve the lifelines. And you still can't get around that intro which takes for ever. Also they didn't even try to do anything with the fastest finger. I still don't recommend this but you might want to give it a try.
4,Good game.,"Great game, what more can be said? Millions of questions that test your knowledge, the only difference is that there is no suspense at all, because you are playing it and you can play it over and over again. You get your three lifelines, one of which is calling your best friend (not in real life). Regis will call the plumber, the butcher and so on to help you with the question at hand and each has their own unique personality. There is not much that can be said about this game, you press the key for the letter choice (A.B.C.D.) of the answer."
3,"Good but, not great.","After buying the first game, which was ok, I thought I would give the second one a chance figuring they would have greatly improved it. Found out though, once you have tried this game for more than ten minutes, sure enough the questions repeat themselves.If you liked the first, and don't mind the repeats you will like this, however if you were annoyed with the first you will be annoyed with this .My best suggestion is to continue to wait until the programmers wait and put more time and effort into the game instead of worrying about getting another out there on the market just to make more money."
4,A Great Game,"I bought the first edition of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and I really enjoyed it, but the questions definitely repeated a lot more than I thought they would. I played the first time, and then I immediately played again and got some of the same questions. The second edition of ""Millionaire"", I think, is better. There are more questions and they are definitely more challenging. However, I took away one star because I think the questions are too hard sometimes. Also, they don't base the difficulty level of the question on how much money it's for- they just kind of throw any question out. Also, I think they should find a better way to do the Fastest Finger. But overall, I'd definitely recommend this game."
1,won't work on windows XP,Just received this and it said on Amazon website that it works with windows XP but it doesn't. The box says windows 95 and 98. And there was a contest registration that expired in 2000! So this game is very old and doesn't work on XP despite what Amazon says.
3,just for a couple songs...,"I use it in my pedalboard just for a couple songs, do not expect more than that! if you want to achieve a great blues sound i highly recomend the seymour duncan twin blue for the same price!"
5,20 star review,"I was trying to find the name of the exact chemistry set I had when I was a kid, I believe my parents bought me my Smithsonian MicroChem in 1995 or 1996. I loved this toy more than anything. I would spend hours in my backyard, wearing my safety goggles and one of my dad's old white dress shirts, pipetting one thing into another and seeing what resulted. This kit is very complete, and although the directions could be made a little more kid friendly, the experiments included are very fun and educational. This is a real chemistry set, not the kitchen materials stuff they try to pass off on kids these days.Regarding durability, I only threw it out the other week. I found the case in my parents garage and all the chemicals had been used up and many of the other items had gone missing or been drafted into use as household items. So it will stand the test of time."
3,Best for younger children,"I got this chemistry set as a birthday present (it looks identical) when I was about 10 or so, and I found it to be a very disappointing set. While there is excellent educational potential in the set, I already understood the majority of the concepts presented...which made for a very boring experience when reading through and performing several of the experiments. I would recommend this for younger children as an introduction to natural phenomenon like surface tension, and beyond keeping them from eating the chemicals or spilling some of the dyes on a nice table or carpet, they should have no trouble using it. As for safety, I can personally vouch that nothing happened (beyond the solution turning purple) when I combined every chemical provided in a test tube."
1,What happened to the real dale Brown?,"My suggestion would be for the author (whoever they are) to read flight of the old dog and then this book. I think they would agree their literary ability is no where near the true Dale Brown.There is nothing redeeming in this novel. The story is implausible, the charactors inconsistant, shallow, ridiculous ect.If this is the direction ""Dale Brown"" is going I don't think many fans will be going along."
2,This is Dale Brown...but just,"Dale Brown has written another entry in the adventures of Patrick ""Muck"" MacLachan. This time they are fighting the Libyans with background assistance from Pavel Kazarov, the villian from the previous book.On the positive side, Brown is excellent in describing the action, especially in the air. However, once he lands on the ground and starts in with dialogue, he is in trouble. Foreigners sound like Americans, with American slang and cadence, as opposed to how they really talk.There are also plot points that are so big, you could fly a B-52 through them. Characters seem to appear in various locations like magic, without reliance on reality. Also, Brown kills off a number of recurring characters for no reason and without remorse.Brown is capable of writing better than he does here. I hope his next effort is better."
5,"Intrigue, Technology and the Middle East","This was my first Dale Brown book and I am now hooked. He is similar to Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler with his excellent details and how they fit into the story.In this story the Nightstalkers are trying out some of their new battle amour and weapons while helping an oil consortium out. But things go wrong when they go into Libya to look around they find multiple missiles etc... While trying to get out part of the team gets caught behind including Patrick's wife Wendy. They are held and tortured by the ""King"" of Libya who is a fraud.At the same time you are following a story line about the development of the weapons by Sky Masters Inc. and their newest genius who you have to read about to believe (great addition).There is a third story line about the Egyptian president who is assinated and his wife taking charge and dealing with both the Libyans and the Night Stalkers.If you are looking for a fast paced exciting book this one is for you!"
2,"More of the same, I'm tired of it.","B-52's converted into Hi-tech stealth attack ships, Tin Man bullet proof body suits with jet boots and electroshock shoulder units, now updated with super strength, wild plots, Dale Brown has it all. I've read several of Brown's books, they all have far out plots and wild ideas for weaponry and this one is no different. This time the gang takes on the new government of Libya, protecting Egypt along the way, it got so silly I couldn't finish it. With a band of people like those working for Skymasters you wouldn't need an army or airforce, just call them in. Maybe that's why the newage/pacifist president ropes them in at the story's end, he finally sees that they're all he needs to save the world. Good for a little light afternoon reading but anything by Tom Clancy is better."
3,3 1/2 stars - OK but could have been so much more,"All things considered, Wings of Fire was a decent book but clearly not among Brown's best efforts. With many of Brown's usual characters back again, there is a sense of familiarity for the fans of Brown's high-tech military thrillers. At the core, the story itself had potential, playing on current Middle East tensions and moving through events that were at least plausible. In the end, though, the story generally left me hoping for more. The story bounced around continuously and somewhat unnecessarily, leaving gaps that left the reader wondering about the relevance of the passage. In addition, the technical jargon on futuristic weapon systems seemed a bit much, even for readers who are used to such things from Brown.Wings of Fire was not so disappointing as to cause me to turn away from future efforts from Brown, but it does leave me hoping that the works to come are better than this effort."
5,Where to go for Dale Brown books,Have bought many books of Dale Brown that are offered on Amazon. Good reading from a great author.
1,Something(s) to be desired,"I have read all of Dale Brown's novels and feel that he has always had a complete mastery of the technological realm of the techno-thriller genre.Having just completed his latest book, Wings of Fire, I am sorry to say that the authors same mastery does not extend to telling a clear, complete story. I was deeply disappointed.The plot development was disjointed, the characters had little depth and the premise was not refective of the current geo-political realities. As well, Mr. Brown needs to find another publisher who does a better job editing. The novel read more like a 3rd draft than a polished, finished product.I can truly state, for the very first time that this was a novel I was anxious to be finished reading.More depth for his characters and less extensive explanation of super-secret techno-speak, wold have made this a MUCH better read."
2,Not the best,"To restate other reviewers, my opionion of the book was that it was long and convoluted. It is not his best work. It barely makes it to ""average"" If you need a book for long airport delays, this is the one. If you are looking for gripping suspense and a well connected plot -- this is NOT the book."
5,"Is Indeed Compatible w/ My 20"" iMac G5 1.8 GHz","What can you say about RAM except that it works? This memory installed fine & was instantly recognized by my 20"" iMac G5 1.8 GHz (the original G5 iMac without the iSight). I replaced two factory 512 MB DIMMs w/ 2 of these 1 GB DIMMs and all is well. Crucial memory has a good reputation & the price was right. I am happy.Installation was easy. If you want some great instructions from Apple themselves, look here:http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/imacG5_20inch_memory.pdf"
4,Ok.,"It was an ok book, absolutley nothing like 5th edition, so I would not recomend cheaping out and buying this edition instead. It has a freindly layout and easy to read."
3,Not as good as some may suggest...,"This book is too dense, basicly all you are getting is one third of the book on the subject. However, the explanation is well written and clear, but it follows few chapters after given example code.In each chapter very much is covered in very short lessons, the author felt like he had to put two other languages in the same book c++ and java.Pros : Good explaination.Cons : Covers very much in each lesson."
3,thought-provoking but inadequate,"This book--which seems to consist largely of legal cases--barely touched on the cultural significance of the word ""nigger."" I was hoping for a much more in-depth linguistic study of usage, but it just wasn't there. Being an old white lady with an interest in linguistics and culture, I suppose I wanted to understand how such a mundane word (it was originally, after all, merely a word for ""black"" the color) came to be so perverted in usage, and so dreadful in meaning. I was disappointed. I think I would also have like to know how to take the venom from this word and make it impotent. Oh, and my children (teenagers) were appalled that I would read this book in public . . . ."
2,Misses the Mark,"This book does raise a lot of interesting topics of conversation/debate, but there seems to be a lot of explanation and discussion lacking. The writing seemed choppy and incohesive at times. I felt bogged down with too many legal cases without really examining them. I was hoping for a clearer understanding of so many issues surrounding this word, but really was left with more question marks. A good start, but it needed more developing."
5,The BIG PAYBACK,"Sly Stone said it very cooly in the late 60's ... ""Don't call me Nigger Whitey"". It was a fresh appeal to whites (because they were the unarguable, original perpetrators of all the tragic color static).This book is perfect. Because the word ""nigger"" was based on one of the ugliest and smallest minded usages ever devised by the white social structure that first adapted it and steadily realized its use and intention was beyond their control. Hail! I say ""Nigger"" with a capital N, to the Status Quo ... Suffer the consequences of employing this once slavingly convenient, now problematic enigmatic word. It was crackuhs that first abused the word until niggas then defused the word, until crackuhs have now co-opted the word for their own sense of cool.So ... stamp it on all your mortgages, birth certificates, and headstones until you all understand the impact of this phantasmagoric little word.To all my favorite niggas, black and white.- A white boy."
1,can i buy a fart?,"A more redundant book you could never find. Absoloutely worthless. As long as it pays the morgage, I guess."
3,Technically well written.,"Dr. Kenneedy has written a well-crafted work on a normally touchy subject. His understanding of the word 'nigger' and its many uses is excellent. He however either over intellectualizes his treatise of the subject with an antiseptic distance and/or is fulfilling the unwritten contract that many Blacks have when their daily bread is gleaned from the White establishment (considering that he works at Harvard this should not be taken lightly) by ignoring the context in which his book will be read.An offence that he considers when explaining, ""What should matter is the context in which the word is spoken -- speaker's aims, effects and alternatives."" (page 51-52) Of course an author of his intellect and achievement does know better.Never the less this is a definite coffee table addition. Guaranteed to get coversation flowing.P.S. What is the deal with its diminutive size; marketing?!?"
4,"Really, Really Good","I got this book from the library last summer, mostly because I was intrigued by the title. I blew through it pretty fast, because once you start reading, you just want to read more. This is a great book, filled with little facts and stories about where it came from. There's even a part about the times it was used in open court. Good book. 4 stars because it gets repeditive at times, but it's still definitely worth a look."
3,Black Language,"Randall Kennedy's Nigger: the Strange Career of a Troublesome Word is about the history of the N-word. A good part of the book is about white people verse black people saying the word. Many black people loosely refer to themselves as niggers. When white people do the same it is an insult to all people involved. White, Detroit rapper Eminem has earned his ""blackness"" to be able to use this word. He has worked hard in a black dominated field and he has been accepted into this ""world."" He is free to use their language. Black people feel it's a privilege to use the word. You must earn your right to use the word. This book is very interesting and as a white person I learned a lot due my reading it. The reader learns the history, meanings, usage, and court cases all surrounding the word nigger."
5,A great history book.,I decided to buy this book after seeing it on 60 minutes and Boston Public. I must admit that I had to buy this book on Amazon because I am white and I didn't feel comfortable buying a book with such a racially charged word as the title. None the less I am glad I bought this book. I will admit that when it comes to African American history I am pretty ignorant and this book helped rid me of some of the ignorance. I am not a racist person but I really need to learn more about African American culture. I was brought up in an almost all white area and many people in my family have racist views. This book gave me a look in a society that I would not have normally seen... I really recommend this book to any one of any race in any country.
2,Disappointment,I was really hoping that Kennedy had some insights into how people could overcome the 'troublesomeness' of the word 'nigger' but he offered nothing. This is only a academic exploration of the use of this word with no real added value to our understand of ourselves and our culture today.
4,"Controversial, but informative","What I liked about this book is that it gives the history and original meaning of that ugly word. It taught me things I never knew. However, I disagree with his theory that the word ""nigger"" is just a word. It is not; it is very hurtful, insulting, and degrading. It is a fighting word. Calling someone a nigger is no different or more hurtful than calling someone a honkey, spic, or gook. While we should be able to keep these words in our dictionaries and movies or books that deal with diversity (or lack thereof), it should be illegal to call anyone such names, such as it is considered illegal assault to spit in one's face. Ethnic/racial/gender/homosexual slurs are no different."
4,Lighten Up!,"Geez - I bought this book because I thought it was a Billary Clinton biography.Seriously, this word is still pervasive. One does not have to be in a redneck bar ""down south"" to hear it in impolite conversation. I prefer to accept Ken Hamblin's read on the word. If political correctness did not rule the world, it would be easy to find various dictionary definitions of this slur that have nothing to do with any race. I come from a long line of Norwegian Blockheads that revel in the ""Ole and Lena"" humor that is certainly not a celebration of the Scandinavian intelligensia. Much like the f-word, ignored or shrugged off, the N-word will diminish in significance.Excuse me now; My four year old grandson just pointed a finger and cocked his thumb at the neighbor boy Although he did not ""pull the trigger"", I have to go post bail. He looked very manly in handcuffs, but it's almost his bedtime. Sleep well tonight. The PC are awake."
4,a Tough word...,"This book is a fine read for students who are mature enough to handle the sensitive subject of ""the N word"". I wonder what people of other ethnicities think of this read... (I am a white male)"
3,high expectations...disappointed,"I bought this book expecting some new and extensive insight into the ""N-word""...and was givin roughly 200 pages of references to court cases. It wasn't until the last 40 pages or so, that any detailed feelings and opinions were offered. Although the book is worth reading, it was disappointing in the end."
2,A disappointment,Pretentious title and not enough material for a book. Four pages wasted on editors for win32 (not even in an appendix). A lot of material that has got absolutely nothing to do with Perl and should not even be mentioned. The only positive thing that can be said about the book is that it sometimes touches subjects that I have not yet seen treated in any other Perl book.
1,Where's the beef?,"Such a promising title, too bad it fails to deliver.This book is pure fluff. Don't waste your money on it."
3,You'll outgrow it quickly.,"Playing this keyboard makes my fingers tired: the keys are really heavy. It's USB 1.0, and I get occasional latency glitches on a pretty fast PC. Also, occasional driver glitches - keys will ""stick"" every once in a while and continue sending. It doesn't *really* do 96khz - you have to turn off 1 pair of the ins or outs to get it to 96, and what good is that? I sure wish program select was a dial or button pair: as it is, all midi commands are enabled by a function button which turns the ivories into midi command buttons.All that said, I use it constantly. Headphones, laptop, ozone and I'm ready to rock."
1,Terrible,"I would have no idea how well this product actually works as I have yet to successfully install and operate it on any of my computers. The drivers are antiquated, bulky and the setup is needlessly complicated. If this weren't enough, the customer service is quite possibly the most worthless I have ever dealt with. This company obviously doesn't take your money seriously.Dan"
2,Trailer won't stay on,"I bought this for my 2 yr old son for Christmas. It's great that it can hold the ""Shake 'n Go"" cars that he has. Unfortunately, the trailer comes off of the truck very easily and it is difficult to line it up to put it back on (even for an adult). I am constantly having to fix it for him and he doesn't play with it much because it's always coming apart. On the bright side, it is cute and built well. We are considering modifying the connecting pin or gluing the trailer to the cab permanently so he can play with it."
3,"Solid program, yet sometimes hard to use.","Microsoft completely reorganized the menu options into their new ""ribbon"" menu system with this release. Most of the time, the ribbon is easy to navigate and find what you're looking for. Other times, what seems like it should be a one or two step process, often takes 4+ steps with the supposedly great ribbon.Overall, this version of PowerPoint is fairly stable and works well."
1,Don't buy,"When I installed it, it erased Word and Excell. Microsoft refused to do anything about it, even though they agreed I installed it correctly.I then had to purchase the entire package and found out that I could have bought the entire package cheaper than I paid for just the Power Point alone.Not a good deal."
5,A Must Have for Students of the Arts,"This book is a must have...it has chapters set up in logical order with exercises in each section to help you master the lesson of each chapter. This author is or was a professor at the prestigious PRATT INSTITUTE of Utica, New York (through Munson Williams Proctor Arts Institute) and Brooklyn/Manhattan, New York...so you know that the instruction is high quality. Most of the illustrations/photos are black and white, and if that bothers you, you may not like this book, but the photos and diagrams are sharp and clear and are a decent size, so they should be of help nonetheless. A great addition to the library of the self-taught artist!"
3,Great press until the pin breaks,"Is this a great garlic press? Yes it is. As long as it lasted, about 1 year, it was the best thing since sliced bread for pressing garlic. However, as already mentioned, the pin holder breaks. Now I used it daily as I love fresh garlic on my salad. So I did use it daily. But not to the point of the unit breaking so soon, I would think. So if you want an excellent garlic press that you will think is fantastic for about a year of daily use, this is for you. Just be aware that they do have a tendency to break at the point where the pin is held by the press. Look at the pics and that is exactly what happened to mine. I do have another one and it has been fine for almost a year now (Yeah, I bought another because I really did like it that much.) I am crossing my fingers that this one will last longer. Hope this helps."
1,Doesn't last long!,"I had this garlic press one year and upon using it to press ONE clove of garlic,, the Metal (?) just broke and out came the screw into my pot.The last garlic press I had lasted 18 years, I expected a little more then ONE out of this garlic press. I would not waste my money on it again!"
4,Quality Garlic Press for Price,"As others have commented, this garlic press has a bit of heft to it. It's a solid, quality product. My only complaint about this garlic press--and take my complaint for what's it worth because I haven't owned many garlic presses in my life--is that the garlic forms a compressed layer on the inside of the grate. It's very hard to scrape and clean. I often spend a few minutes trying to maneuver my fingers inside the press to pick out the smashed garlic. Sometimes I choose to just chop the garlic by hand because, with clean up time, it's often faster. I only use the garlic press when I am incorporating a LOT of garlic into a recipe. If it's only a clove or two, then I do it by hand."
3,Buying Another,"This garlic press works very well. It easily presses large cloves and the plastic piece that fits into the holes makes cleaning easy. Unfortunately, mine broke after 19 months use. The metal near the hinge completely broke on both sides. I would have expected the plastic piece to break off first. I used it frequently (at least 3 times/week), but it was never put in the dishwasher and rarely soaked. I would just rinse it right after use most of the time. Although I'm disappointed, I'm buying another. I've seen comments about the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press being good, but I'd have to buy 4 Trudeau presses to surpass the price of 1 Kuhn Rikon press. I'll take my chances with Trudeau. We'll see how long this one lasts."
5,Great product,The press was received very quickly and exactly as described. We purchased it after a great review in Cook's Illustrated magazine and have been very pleased with it.
2,Another one bites the dust,"When I first got this garlic press, I would have given it 5 stars. It seemed sturdy and strong, easy enough to use, and not horrible to clean. Then it starting retaining water from cleaning between the parts. Then the rubber handles starting sliding off when I was using it. Finally, the whole hinge just snapped. I wasn't even pressing a very large clove, so it was just that the accumulated use had weakened the metal. If you don't mind buying a new one in a couple of years, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,Easily Broken,"I purchased this garlic press based on the reviews on Amazon. We use garlic in just about every dish we prepare. The mega press my husband uses is too big for my hands and I needed one a little smaller. This press crushes garlic beautifully and cleans up fairly easily. HOWEVER...beware that water creeps into the handles if it is submerged for washing or put in the dishwasher. OK We dealt with that...until this afternoon, 15 months after purchasing this garlic press, the pin in the hinge broke in two. It is now unusable. This press is not worth the money. I think I'll get myself a stainless steel press this time."
3,Dead at 13 months old,"I LIKE Fresh Garlic! Which explains why I bought a garlic press. I used this about 1-3 times a week... on 6-8 cloves each use.This is NOT the first press I have owned that went POP... and it DOES have a 5 year warranty, except I have to pay return postage, and pack it up, and trudge down to the Post Office and wait.I 'll probably just toss it.... and start over. Maybe if i SPEND MORE MONEY...I'll get a better press?!"
2,Must be better ones out there,I do like that this press can hold 2-3 cloves and is easy to squeeze. I don't like the fact that much of the garlic is wasted (doesn't go through the holes) and that it's very difficult to clean---the rubber nibs just don't do the job and you have to dig it out with a knife.
4,"Great, but for one or two things:","UPDATE 8/23/12: Trudeau contacted me based on my review & pictures here and sent me a new one. Excellent customer service, way to stand behind your product! I've changed my rating from 3 to 4. If, by some miracle, the handles no longer fill with water in the dishwasher I'll up it to 5.I'm on my fourth or fifth garlic press, all having either broken or presented some major design flaw.The Trudeau Garlic Press does a great job of mincing garlic and the cleaning mechanism works very well.Unfortunately it's hollow and unsealed and fills with dirty water in the dishwasher. A poor feature in a ""dishwasher safe"" product!If you intend to hand wash your press then this is a great choice. If not, you may want to keep looking.Update 1/1/12:It served me well for four years but last night snapped trying to mince a clove of garlic. See pics."
1,Mine Broke!,I had this for about a year until last night when it broke. Unbelievable! I was simply pressing a clove of garlic and the bolt in the hinge that holds the two pieces together broke into three pieces. Very strange. I would never buy this item or brand again.
1,Stay away from it,"Bought this press as it was #2 at Test Kitchen. Had it about 2 years til it broke the other night. Part of the hinge assembly literally broke off the body as I was squeezing the garlic. This is chrome plated zinc. The zinc not strong enough to take continual use. We go through a lot of garlic in our cooking. This press replaced the Zyliss in which the non-stick coating wore away exposing the bare metal underneath the coating. This was the same problem Test Kitchen had with theirs, and the reason they tested again to find a replacement. So stay away from both the Trudeu and Zyliss presses unless you want to be buying replacements about every 2 years. Very disappointed in both of them."
2,"For moderate/heavy use, look elsewhere","My press lasted a little over a year. With light use I'm assuming this press will last for years, but serious garlic eaters should probably look for a sturdier product. Within six months of having it, the Trudeau's pin began to slightly loosen, and I would have to push it back into the frame before and after each use. About six months after that I was crushing a SINGLE clove of garlic and a piece of the metal at the shoulder just snapped off. I won't be purchasing this model again, even at half price."
5,Large and easy to clean,"I decided to purchase this garlic press because it was recommended by America's test kitchen. My old one was hard to clean and only pressed one clove at a time. This one is incredibly easy to clean, and I can press 2 or 3 cloves at a time. The handle is very comfortable as well."
5,NICE TOOL,"WORKS GREAT, SMASHES GARLIC WITHOUT GETTING HANDS SMELLY, NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE IF YOU DONT PEEL THE GARLIC FIRST BECAUSE IT DOESNT COME OUT AS CLEAN AND YOU WASTE A LOT, EASY TO CLEAN, GREAT TOOL FOR GARLIC LOVERS."
1,Mine was junk after one use,"Put a clove of garlic in it, pressed it, and what do I see but the garlic that comes out is GRAY?!?The metal coating came right off. (See photo I uploaded) Yah, this thing is incredibly cheaply made. It's going back."
3,A bit too big and not easy to clean,"When America's Test Kitchen said this is their new favorite, besting their former faveZyliss Susi DeLuxe Garlic Press, I had to try it. I love the Zyliss press, so I had high hopes for this one. I was let down. Yes, it is quite big, but it seems to be of much lower quality than the Zyliss. The material (plastic?) seems to be a little rough in the hopper. And although the cleaner being part of this one is a good idea, it seems it is hard to get all the little gunk out of the corners. I suppose the testers didn't look too closely at ease of cleaning. The overall size of this press is bigger than the Zyliss, so if you have small hands, or not a lot of grip strength, this one is not for you. I have almost always been able to fit a clove in the Zyliss, so unless you want or need a big hopper, no need for the extra room."
3,Works fine,"This garlic press is sturdy and presses the garlic enough to make removing the skin easier. However, I found out that it really does not mince the garlic through the holes. Probably, it does if you really press very hard but I end up mincing garlic with a knife...a two step process."
4,Heavy Duty Garlic Press,I have been using this garlic press for a couple of weeks now and have been very satisfied with it. It's very sturdy and really has a lot of oomph to squeeze out the garlic. Looks like it will last a long long time and we eat garlic often around here!
1,Would be wonderful but for flawed design.,"I haven't used this particular product, but rather an identically designed Food Network brand one. The ergonomics are great and the press works very efficiently and comfortably.... until it breaks.The handles are actually plastic that are glued into place. I was in the middle of pressing garlic and one of the handle pieces broke off in my hand. And so ended my garlic press.The Food Network brand has actually redesigned their press to accomodate this flaw... the handle on the piece that moves is now solid metal.Would be better if the handles were metal with a plastic coating."
4,A Very Good Garlic Press for the Price,"I purchased this product because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated as a best buy. It has worked very well. My fiance and I cook a lot and our old garlic press was hard to press more than one clove at a time and very hard to clean. With this press, you can fill the hopper full of cloves and it takes very little effort to press the garlic; all of the clove is pressed out and only the paper remains. The press is also very easy to clean with the silicone cleaners that are located on the opposite side of the plunger, the garlic in the hopper is removed and it only needs to be rinsed out with water to remove all the remaining garlic. We are very happy with our purchase."
1,Mine broke even before I could use it ...,"I bought this Trudeau garlic press because Cook's Illustrated had rated it quite well, as a bargain for the price. Well, the plastic doodad that cleans the garlic from the holes managed to break even before I could use it. It was glued in place, and not very firmly, honestly I think the plastic was broken in at least one spot, but the glue didn't do it's job either. I returned mine, thank goodness that was no hassle.Instead I got a much more expensive press, aRösle Garlic Pressthat works just great. (I also prefer the design, since it's virtually impossible to pinch my fingers, which would have been possible with the Trudeau.)"
5,Heavy and solid,"This is a heavy and solid garlic press. It's weight makes it comfortable to use and the stainless steel makes it easy to clean. The rubber grips also make it easy to handle. It's hard for such a simple product to impress me. However, this did the job. It was a well thought out and well constructed product. It was not value-engineered into junk."
2,Trudeau Garlic Press,"This garlic press has rubber sleeves that go over the handles, and when the press is washed water goes inside the sleeves, which requires taking the sleeves off after washing to dry out, or removing the sleeves prior to washing. Found this inconvenient."
1,Good while it lasted.... not long,"I will add my experience, which was similar to those of sevreral others here -- it broke at the hinges with normal use relatively quickly. It looks sturdy, but it's only as strong as its weakest point -- and that was not strong at all. Definitely not worth it."
3,was great until it broke,"I was very happy with this garlic press for the two years that I had it, after I saw a good review of it in Cook's Illustrated, but then it broke -- the metal simply failed. I will probably upgrade to the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean, in the hopes of getting a good long-lasting garlic press."
5,Excellent Press,"This garlic press is very well built and easy to use. I've gone through several other presses, as I use it nearly everyday, and the Trudeau is solidly built and easy to clean, so long as you remove the garlic skins before they dry. Reasonably priced, and works just as well as more expensive units."
2,Hinge breaks easily,"Unfortunately, this garlic press turns out to be unreliable. I've owned two of them now and both broke at the hinge under normal use after a year or so (they are warrantied for five years). I'll be looking into returning it to the manufacturer, but you'll save yourself some trouble by not buying it (twice) like I did."
5,The best one so far,"I've tried many garlic presses over the years, and several over the last few months, but this one is the best that I have seen so far. It is strong and doesn't give or bend when I press peeled garlic cloves. It cleans easily, as long as you do it right away."
5,Quick and easy,"I've only used this garlic press a few times, but it works very well. It's solid. I put the whole clove in, peel and all, and squeeze hard. Once garlic is out, open and remove peel. Cleanup is easy if you rinse it right away."
2,Lots of garlic waste and a lot of muscle required,"I purchased this press based on the recommendation from America's Test Kitchen. However it underperforms compared to my Zyliss. ATK had given the Zyliss a lower rating because the non-stick coating peels off eventually, however the version that I have does not have the coating. The good things about the Trudeau is the ease of cleaning and the solid construction. The bad things are that it leaves a lot of uncrushed garlic in the hopper. (I did a side by side comparison with my Zyliss and the Trudeau only yielded half as much crushed garlic as the Zyliss even though the original cloves were the same weight and size.) The other down side is that the Trudeau handles are so large it is hard for me to grasp (I have small hands) and requires more pressure and effort than my Zyliss. Long story short, I'm giving the Trudeau to a friend and sticking with my Zyliss."
1,terrible quality,"The plastic cleaning tines got stuck to the holes in the press and then pulled apart - I thought I just got a bad one, but the next two replacement items I got did the same thing!"
5,Great value!,"Having spent many many years with run of the mill presses, I had no idea this type existed. Thanks to Cook's Mag I got turned on to the Trudeau. It is night and day different from the others, the construction is very heavy, solid. It has a handy cleaner attached for one step operation, the garlic is completely extruded, skin & all the rest stay behind. You'll never need another."
2,I loved it until...,"I bought this garlic press, as many others no doubt have, based on the Cook's Illustrated Magazine recommendation. It has a large hopper and feels very solid; it can crush a couple of unskinned cloves at a time. It is easy to clean and is dishwasher-safe. I would have loved to give this product a five-star recommendation, but, after about 7 months of almost daily use, my garlic press snapped in half! I had to go back to using my old, small, hard to clean press. It feels flimsy in comparison to the Trudeau press, but it has never broken; I'm glad I kept it around! Because I liked using it so much, I was tempted to buy another Trudeau, in case the one I bought was just defective. But based on reading other product reviews where people described the exact problem I had, I will be shopping around for a different brand next time."
2,Broke after less than a`year,This press worked well and I loved it until it broke. Used for less than a year and now I'm looking for a replacement. Won't buy it again!
2,Broke,"After several years of use it snapped, I guess despite it's decent weight it's still just plastic."
2,Breaks easily,"This garlic press works great for a while. It looks and feels like it's solid metal, but it's actually chrome-plated plastic with a hunk of something heavy in the non-structural parts. So it looks like you can push hard on it for things like ginger, but if you do it will break."
1,Handle snapped off during pressing doesn't look like stainless either inside.,One of the handles snapped near the base when my daughter was pressing garlic. Inside of the handle it doesn't appear to be solid stainless steel. If looks like a more of a zinc or aluminum alloy. Needless to say it isn't very strong. The outside finish may be stainless but not inside the handles that takes the strength!
3,good quality poor clean up!,This press is solid enough for our uses and has held together nicely.It does the job.It however doesn't clean up as nicely as it claims and you have to work to get the smashed garlic out of the inside of the press (the teeth press it out some but it doesn't seem to clean up without quite a bit or work) and also you will mostly have to scrap off the minced garlic for use with a fork or spoon.
2,Good while it lasts,"I bought this press because it seemed like a good, rugged press. I used it a few times a month for ~4 years and the cast metal handle snapped at the hinge. For $15 I expect more use out of a product than this light load."
2,Cleans (and breaks) very easily.,"The rubber cleaning pad made it very easy to clean all the little holes. However, after only about a couple of months of use, the press broke into two pieces."
2,Solid Construction Wastes garlic,"So I used this press for my garlics and I'd like to say it leaves a good 2-3mm film of garlic wasted on the bottom. The garlic fibers are strong enough to resist going through the holes completely w/ the length of pins on this press. It cleans easy and i usually just use it only when I need a significant amount of garlic. Professional use or large quantities it's a great piece to own but for the average house, disfunctional."
5,"Good Stuff, But Not as Good As the Real Thing.","This book is an excellant introduction to the world of defensive handgunning. The book says what needs to be said to get the newbie oriented properly and fundimentally educated on the issues at hand; a Journeyman effort in this genre.What's frustrating about this book is that John Farnam is far more than Journeyman in person...he's a true Master with teaching and inspirational abilities that do not translate to the printed page. I recommend that you buy and read the book, but know that you're only getting half a loaf. To get the other half, the best half, you need to go and train with John in person."
5,A GREAT RESCOURCE!,"This is a great book, I went through Mr. Farnams defensive handgunning course, and this is a great rescource to reference what was taught. These are PROVEN methods he has developed by learning from experiance what works. Very hard to find this kind of experiance in book form. A+. I also can't see how you wouldn't rate it with 5 stars, must not have appreciated the subject matter, as Mr. Farnam would say, ""Grass eater mantality."""
3,"Marvellous concept, beautiful setting, mediocre plot.","The Denver Post reviewed ""Bundori"" saying, ""Sano may carry a sword and wear a kimono, but you'll immediately recognize him as an ancestor of Philip Marlow or Sam Spade."" This review is fitting in more ways than one.While the characters and concepts behind this book promise a brilliant novel, the plot is uninspired and could easily be translated to take place in 1930's L.A. And while the descriptions of the settings and characters were vivid, the dialog lacked the extensive rhetoric and polite double-talk of Japanese samurai and courtiers of the period.An excellent setting, but a dull story."
4,"Fun Detective story,","I like all of the stories in this series. Not as much for the detective aspect, wich is good, but more for the office politics correlations to real life. It's sad but true, that ability and performance will always be targeted by insecure non talents more than they will be rewarded for greatness. If you've ever felt like this you will relate to this hero, as he tries to balance being a good man and still keep his job."
2,Bundori Review,"This book seemed to explore too many avenues and had the usual formula to cover up the ""who did it"" scenario in a murder mystery. Sometimes I was quite disturbed with the sexual subject matter. The authour did spend sometime researching and giving fantastic imagery to medieval Japan. So I felt I was enlightened in that respect. The ending is really rushed and not conventional. I thought is was weak and the overall story was robbed because of it."
3,Hmmm..,"I read a lot of the reviews before buying this and I can see why the audience is split. Some find this engrossing, some just tedious. My MOR ruling is that it is indeed tedious in places but captivating in others. The historical 'feel' is good, the character tensions enough to keep the plot moving, and the sex scenes provide the necessary interludes. My criticism is that in striving for an antique feel, the author slips into antique language [my favourite was a ghost who talks about 'making dung'] and this can be quite jarring [especially in the sexual interludes, where characters are large of member, dark of nipple].All in all, acceptable for a plane ride but I don't see collecting the entire set."
2,not very useful,Very basic with no details about the brands out there. Instead of buying this buy Baby Bargains by the Fieldses
3,No the best out there,"Good on giving information about products in general, but does not get very specific. It describes all types of car seats, for example, but does not add any actual product reviews to help you make a better decision. Baby Bargains Secrets by Denise & Alan Fields is a much better buy for the money; it also includes good descriptions and explanations about the products and has actual product reviews by brand name, model name and price range to help you choose. They have actually researched the products they recommend."
4,MS Project Purchase,"This was my first software purchase on Amazon. Because the product was $100 less than I'd seen on the Microsoft website and in retail stores, I was nervous that the product was not new or would not come with a ""key"" or some other issue. I was delighted to receive a completely new software package just as if I bought it retail."
1,Can't seem to get the vendor to send it to me,"If you will notice the date of this review (July 21, 10) and the date that I placed my order (June 15, 10) you will see that it has been almost a month and I still do not have the product I ordered, the substitution that the vendor suggested or a credit to my account.I can't comment on the product since I have never gotten it. I can say that I will never buy from Express 24/7 again. I am still trying to get a credit for the almost $300.00 that I paid for this."
1,Fail,"Glad I waited until 3rd use before reviewing. 1st use last summer, worked great. Packed away, out of sunlight in garage. 2nd use, end of summer, worked great, put away in garage out of direct sunlight. 3rd use today, POP POP POP splits in three different places!"
1,You are kidding - 50 millimeter long ...,"Come on folks. I know the US chickened out on the conversion to the metric system, but enough folks DID learn that there are 25.4 millimeters to the inch. So this hose is just under 2 inches long? I don't think so. But how long is it really??"
4,The Princess Tales,"This book was pretty good, but I think the stories should have extended longer. The three stories, The Fairy's Mistake, The Princess Test, and Princess Sonora and the Long Sleep, tell about girls back in time when fairies were real. Since I like these sort of things, I loved this book pretty much. The Fairy's Mistake kind of reminded me of Ella Enchanted, which is an excellent book. The Princess Test is a different tale of the Princess and the Pea, with a twist to it. Princess Sonora and the Long Sleep also is like another story, Sleeping Beauty, but also has a twist to it. These three stories are some I would recommend to anyone who likes pretty much all of Gail Carson Levine's books!!"
4,A fun read.,"I new doctor comes to a small TX village to a clinic that needs a Dr. Only problem is, it's a she instead of a he. The citizens are mostly Indians and Mexicans, and don't trust the white doctor. She has to deal with that as well as the head of the committee that arranged for a Dr. Sparks start to fly when they meet. Will she stay, or leave?"
4,Healing Arthritis and More,"This is a short and very easy read with some very good background on the wonders of Cetyl Myristoleate. Dr. Cochran focuses on Arthritis but this is one power pack supplement that can benefit most any type wellness challenge associated with inflammation.There are many Cetyl Myristoleate products on the market and also some excellent combinations products that also include MSM, Glucosamine, Chondroitin and more. Very worth the investment.[...]"
4,emmy jo,the first video was great because emmy jo had her go go boots and mini skirt. the second was a disappointment because she wore slacks. i have been watching the new zoo review since the mid 70s and love emmy jo. she has the most attractive legs of any female i've ever seen. i have been trying to locate where i can purchase videos of the new zoo review but can't get any information. does anyone know???
2,Very poor on some topics,This book covers some topics such as code access security really well but others like ASP.NET security really badly.The ASP.NET section is almost useless - so few pages and so little information.It would have been better if the book had been called .NET code access security and didn't bother with the other stuff.
2,good,"A good book, but too long for the subject; more of a reference for those who know the subject, rather than a learning tool for those just learning the subject."
4,Good Information,"When I was assigned the task of finding out what .NET security was all about in the web environment, I didn't know what I was getting into. The whole .NET security infrastructure is really a handful. This book helps the reader understand what its all about.Another thing I like about the book is the fact that it has short chapters. This made it easier for me to read through it with above average speed."
5,"If you read only one book on World War I, make it this one.","Richard Holmes has written a no-nonsense concise guide to both World War I and the controversial historiography that has dogged the conflict ever since. He summarizes the events of the Western Front (only--other theaters are mentioned only as they impact Germany's decisions about force allocation) quickly, perhaps too quickly for my taste. He slows down a little bit when reviewing the major controversies from the war over tactics, strategy, and war guilt, where he examines the different schools of thought with an even hand. Sometimes his hand is too even: on some topics, particularly when discussing the question of why trench warfare degenerated into such bloody, futile slaughter, I wanted Holmes to be bolder in naming names.But these are petty disagreements with what is a very successful attempt to summarize the events on the Western Front. I hope Holmes will someday give other theaters similar treatment."
1,"Shallow, inconsequential","A book that adds little to historical knowledge, or the reputation of the author for that matter. I wonder why the editor will let it go to press at all."
5,classroom activities resource,"The late author is known as the premier ""worm guru"" in the vermicomposting world. The learning activities in this book will be used with fifth graders as they are introduced to the wonderful experience of feeding 1000 plus redworms scraps from cafeteria lunches. Many of the pages will be duplicated and used for reading, science, and math. There are activities on measuring worms, observing and drawing worm parts, and comprehension passages to assess meaning. I will have students keep pages in a worm folder. I also like the diary and writing activities. Everyone should be aware of the benefits of worms ""eating"" our garbage..from rich compost for plants and the garden...to reducing landfill usage and the production of methane gas. Answer key is included in back of resource. I am very glad I purchased this."
3,Shipping a drag,The book took over two weeks to be delivered. It's probably a good idea to use expidited shipping if you want to recieve your books before two weeks time.
5,Excellent Mandarin textbook!,"Kung Fu (I): An Elementary Chinese Text is a wonderful resource for Mandarin instruction and learning. Material is graded for intermediate level students, but will be appreciated by beginners as well. Lessons utilize English, Pinyin and both Simplified and Traditional characters. I highly recommend Kung Fu (I): An Elementary Chinese Text to any serious Mandarin student."
4,Great starter book,"Had to buy this for a class. The book was in good condition, writing in it here and there but it got the job done. It is a good starter for anyone wanting to learn Chinese-Mandarin."
1,Superficial book,"I like Chinese kung-fu very much. But this book isn't the sort of stuff that will appeal to me, for it's very superifical, without touching on the deep and varied tradition of the martial arts."
5,It was a great book. I learned a lot from it.,I liked the way it was written and I liked the information within this book. It was the best that I have ever read.
5,An absolutely super goose hunting book. The best ever?????,I learned so much from this book and I want to thank all involved.
5,My husband loved this book. I bought it for him!,"In addition to my husband loving this book, I found a lot of good receipes in the back that I have put to use. We enjoy our goose dinner a lot more than in the past because of this book. Thanks Amazon. Com!"
5,I really enjoyed this book and the way it was written!!!!!!,I must have learned over 50 things from this book. It was great!
5,Everything about this book was great! It is the best ever!,"The style of writing, the advice and topic format and the great information about goose hunting will make this book the best ever written about waterfowl. I read it over 30 times!"
5,This book is full of good stories and information!,"I have read 5 other books by Dennis Hunt but, this is the best. He really gives you some good tips as well as, tells it like it is. He admits, he made every mistake possible while hunting 35 years trying to get better. He never brags even though, he has killed 12,000 geese shooting alone or with the help of someone else. Some of his stories in this book are hysterical!"
5,It was a super book. I will recommend it to goose hunters.,"There were some great chapters in the book, especially those on concealment, strategies, decoys and decoy placements. I really learned a lot about concealment and how many decoys to use."
4,Well done plot and illustrations,"How Georgie Radbourn Saved Baseball by David Shannon (1994) uses sequential color impact well. There is a plot to rid the world of Baseball. The color schemes are dark to indicate a somber mood in the beginning, and as the villain progresses. As the villain is foiled, the illustrations lighten in hue, symbolizing the lifting of the mood of the characters. There are other color cues as well, such as the hero's bright yellow baseball cap. Good illustrations and plot. If the child is not a baseball fan, there may not be enough interest, but well done otherwise."
2,Useless Light,"While ""guillotine"" style clippers are great, the light is difficult to turn on and when it does come on, varies in brightness while in use. The bendable light just doesn't seem long enough to get close enough to the nail to see through and seems more in the way."
5,Very good.,"Lots of fantastic sounds on here....Listen to the album first without reading the liner notes, try to figure out what you are hearing, and look forward to the day when parents are forcing their small children to take siren lessons along with piano or violin."
2,HUH!!!,"If your a collector than this tab book is good for you. If you wanna learn how to play some Dime tunes than DON'T GET THIS BOOK! It has the wrong tabs for ""Walk"". Common now. I'm really dissapointed. The band Pictures are cool though. What I'm saying is... I should have read the reviews!"
2,Terrible,Wish I would have read the reviews. The tabs ARE wrong and the pictures ARE cool for a collector... but this book fails at its most basic intended purpose of guitar tab books.
5,"Great book, but look into buying her brand new book first","I have an earlier edition of this book, and have really enjoyed using it. It includes background and the author's commentary on each fruit or vegetable (and, as one of the authors notes, not your ""garden variety"" fruit and vegetables, but unusual things like kumquats and quince that those of us who grew up on iceberg lettuce may not have encountered.) She also includes a sampling of recipes for each item. The recipes have the author's usual creative flair, and all the ones I have tried have been really great. But, unless I was really more interested in the fruit part of the equation, I would look into buying her new vegetable book first. It was just published in December 2001, and would therefore be more current. There has been so much change in bringing some of the more unusual foods to market that it may make most sense to have Schneider's most recent book."
3,Rothschild the world's banker,"A very complete book, a mine of facts but the author was unable to sort what is important from miscellaneous. The mix of general european history, business history and family events is by moments as indigestible as porridge por a non-scot."
2,Where's The Story,The book had many facts and details that broke up the pace of the book for me. The author appears to be the first writer who has gained access to much of the Rothchild's historical records. He then has so many facts that any future writer of this family will have to footnote him till their big toe hurts. I have found Ron Chernow books well documented and that they read like a novel rather than a High School text book.
1,More Text Book than Biography,"I ordered this book about the Rothschilds in hopes of a thorough family biography. Instead I received an economic textbook that is long, obscure and if one is NOT a trained economist, extremely boring. I'm fortunate to have a history degree from Yale just to be able to understand the context of wars/conflicts in which the various Rothschild banking maneuvers took place. And believe me, this book explains in excruciating detail the issuing of bonds, the buy-backs, interest rates, take-overs, loans to various governments, etc etc. I'm sure someone far more literate in markets, bonds, and the like, will find this tome very illuminating. I did not."
2,Disappointed:,"I agree with one of the critics that the book had many facts and details that broke up the pace of the book for me. Ferguson presumes that the reader knows a fair amount about bonds, consuls and other financial mechanisms. He would have done well to slow down a bit and explain a few of the terms and concepts. And I think that Ferguson tells an utterly superficial and innocuous history of the Family. Long awkward sentences make for labored reading. That having been said, this was no doubt a delicate and ambitious undertaking."
3,Boring,After reading the numerous glowing reviews I thought I would enter a story about a fascinating family during a turbulent period in history. Instead I felt as though I was reading a financial piece. Too much detail. I kept looking for the book to breakout and read like the reviews.It is rare that I do not finish a book but after 220 pages I gave up.
2,Nothing about the real family ....,"This book is not about the members of this vast family. I wish to know what the writer knows of the real Rothschild family, the people, their lives, everyday living? Their pain and heartaches? What does he know? Why not print the truth's about the family behind all he has to say about this so called empire. There are real people here...."
5,The Instruction Manual for Launching Your High Tech Venture,"This book takes a pragmatic, no-BS approach to high-tech startups. Rob's style is to be fun, funny, and informative. This book moves really fast because Rob's not going to waste your time on flowery language, but just tells it like it is.One of the most useful parts of the books is his slide-by-slide description of how to make a great venture capital pitch. These are slides that any business that is seeking venture capital can, and should, follow. I have personally used his approach to raise millions in venture capital for my two companies, and I know many other who have as well."
4,SMARTUPS -is good for entrepreneurs of all types.,"I have read this book a couple of times in my business career. Whether you have aspirations of IPO's or you are simply wanting to vet an existing business or a business idea read this book. The book will provide you with plenty to chew on. It's not written by an academic but by someone who has been there. SmartUps is a quick, easy and enjoyable read; addressing and applying the concepts and questions presented throughout is tough and necessary work for a business entrepreneur of any type."
2,Boy isn&#65533;t Rob Ryan a really smart guy.,"I was ultimately disappointed by this book. It spent too much time emphasizing how incredibly smart a guy Rob Ryan is. It seemed very repetitious. Yes, it is written in a lighthearted style, but overall seemed like it only had enough content for a magazine article. He's been mentioned in Inc. magazine several times, which is what prompted me to buy it, but I didn't really learn that much from the book. One of the least useful of my many books on entrepreneurship. It does have a nice cover."
2,Smartups: How to apply for Rob Ryan's Entrepreneur America Boot Camp for Start-Ups,"If you intend to apply for the author's ""boot camp"" then I guess this book is a must read. It will tell you to not bother him unless you have a committed team, a working prototype, and have lined up some customers (preferably corporate customers).There is also some material on how to explore business ideas, roles in organizations that must be filled, board meeting minutes etc -- but it's too focussed on specific kinds of startups and too thin on the details to save you from having to read a more detailed book."
1,Nothing New - This is a renamed version of 2001 Version,"This is nothing more than a renamed paperback version of Rob's 2001 ""Entrepreneur America: Lessons from Inside Rob Ryan's High-Tech Start-Up Boot Camp"". The origional book gets a 5 star rating from me. (...)this was promoted as a new book, not a new printing with a different name. If you already have the earlier edition, don't waste your money on this one. If you don't, buy it and learn from Rob. My criticism is the lack of disclosure that this is a reprint and the false expectations that were built from the advertising that this actually offered new content from an author I greatly respect and will automatically purchase any of his new books."
5,The guidebook for successful startups,"This book is targeted at entrepreneurs who need advice on vetting their idea, and what to do next. His sunflower model is good for identifying your company's core competency and platform technologies.This book is also a fun read. Rob's personality really comes through and you get a feel for what it would be like to work with him. After you finish the book, you are going to want to visit his website and apply for his bootcamp."
3,Decent for starter photogs,"I bought this ND filter for my FujiFinepix S5100, the only issues I have with it are minor, it's a plastic lens so be aware of that before you buy. and it seems a little smaller than my other 55mm filters. Only in regards to the lens cap, it won't fit on anymore with the filter attached. Other than that, the filter does what it's designed to do. I gave it three stars because of the size issue and it being plastic. If you're like me, don't have a ton of cash to spend, this is a good filter to get you started."
3,pretty good,"Bought this for my wife. Like the wide angle. Hate the shutter lag. Video is very good. I use a Nikon d200 w/ half a dozen great lenses so I am pretty picky. This ain't no D200, but for $250 and a compact size it works for casual snapshot photos. Shutterlag however is killer (bad)."
4,Panasonic Lumix FX100,"This review is based on first impressions and published specifications only since I gave it as a gift and played with it only once.It has a great form factor, looks better in person, and gives the impression of solid build quality. The wide angle lens is a distinguishing feature vs. many competitors. Outstanding as a video camera - my A/V professional friend wonders why anybody would by a digicam costing 2 to 4 times more. I concur based on what I've seen of the video it shoots. Very nice Leica lens and image stabilization that really works.IMO, this camera is an easy pick as best of the bunch in its price class.One downside that has been suggested is poor exposure latitude (e.g. poor definition in the shadows of a shot) and high noise that results from cramming so many MPs on a tiny CCD sensor. Panasonic, it is time to put a big CCD in this unit and improve signal processing."
2,A frustration with this camera,"This could be a great little simple camera. Some good things like others have pointed out. But I'm so frustrated with the user-unfriendly design! Panasonic could have used a standard mini-USB plug, but no, they created their own connector, which causes me to have to carry still one more cable - not to mention finding it when I need it. They could have used standard AA or AAA batteries, but no, they created a special, different battery for which we must have their charger. I lost my charger and am now waiting for the replacement to be shipped.If Panasonic could standardize their products to use power and connectors we already have, this coul maybe be the best tiny 12MP camera around."
2,FX100 Review,"I strongly suggest you doNOT buy the FX100. I sold my Panasonic LX2 in order to buy a FX100. I bought into the hype. I was a fool. The LX2 is a much better camera. The FX100 has problems:1. The ""superior"" lens cannot reproduce tne detail in anything white. Only in macro mode 2. The smallest aperture is F5.6. Theoretically this is F11. in 35m.m. Yet,shooting scenics is a joke.3. The auto focus will not repeat. One shot is fairly sharp, the next is not as sharp. And,don't forget,there are no manual controls. I suggest you buy the FX100 only if you want to take snapshots that you really don't care too much about."
4,Good to Excellent,"The camera itself is very nice and intuitive to use. I would prefer to have a viewer in conjunction with the screen for glary days. It is hard to see the screen in harsh sun. The package is very stripped down for the cost...no extras at all ( for example a carrying case, extra battery, decent memory card). So far it takes very nice photos."
4,North American Indian Beadwork Designs,The book is very well put together and has a good quality paper and color designs. I look forward to working on some of the designs.
2,bead book,"This book is great for Indian history buffs. But, I needed it for learning new beading patterns, not quite what I needed. However, I will keep this book with the rest of our collection. My family is part of the Cherokee Tribe."
5,Excellent treatise on the essense of Pa-kua.,"The Pa-kua system shown in this book is a condensed series of forms that may be picked up strickly from the well-presented photos. The real benefit comes from the 50+ years of Pa-kua practical experience that the authors have from their studies with multiple lineage holders from different areas of China. This enormous amount of experience is distilled into the essense of Pa-kua: the actual theoretical aspects of the art. These keen insights are a must for a practitioner of any spiritual practice, be it a martial art or purely meditative practice."
3,Good but Vague,"This work was pretty good, and is really valuable for someone who wants to know this form. However, the book is vague, with almost no photographs until the form. There are no applications, which I wanted so bad. The book is also very short. Overall, It's pretty good. However, it doesn't compare to his first work on Hsing-I quan."
2,"Only form of Bagua? No, thank you...","This book contains some history, 8 palm changes of Wang Shu Jin's Baguazhang (presented by Mr. Pittman) and a little discussion on philosophy of art.At first - this is not book for beginner who do not know the body mechanics of Bagua.At second - there is nothing written about Bagua fighting. There are no applications of palm changes, nor combat principles of Bagua. IMO, this is the great disadvantage of the book.But this book is not as bad as it seems for the firs view - it contains several training tips which could help you in understanding of Bagua.Finally - there are better books on this subject, but also worst. My advice is: do not buy this book unless you are very interested on Wang Shu Jin's form."
1,Book with enough substance to please the wanderer,"I don't like the conciseness and lack of information in this book. It's ok, but if you're looking for information in the martial arts arena, this book won't help.Check out my list ""Martial Arts"" in my ""about me area"".Thank you."
3,The first English book on Baguazhang is a mediocre one,"I've read this book several times, trying to figure out exactly what in it appeals so readily to certain martial artists. In the end, the only thing I can think of is that the demonstration of the form is rather decent.Other than that, there are no applications shown, no good philosophy work shown, no integration of qigong shown, etc.Perhaps Mr. Smith is a good practioner of Baguazhang. However, his book has no real depth behind it.Still, it's better than nothing.Better reading can be found in *Emei Baguazhang*, that massive tome by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming and Mr. Liang, Shou-Yu.The best Baguazhang books written in English are by Sifu Park Bok Nam and Dan Miller: ""The Fundamentals of Pa Kua Zhang."" There are two volumes. The first is a must-read, regardless of your Baguazhang background. If you can comprehend the content of the first volume, then second becomes a necessary addition to your library."
3,Read This review before buying,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste."
5,"Cross My Heart (The Hidden Diary,1)",Iliked this book because it teaches you all about your...Real Friends and People you can Trust.This book kept me so interested in reading I didnot want to put it down.I like how Lucy and Serena are always there for each other and they have a great relationship.
3,"The most beautiful edition, but story lacked flow","My daughter is very familiar with the Nutcracker, and it was a pleasant surprise to see an edition that only touched on the scary beasts that come after the Nutcracker one time. The paintings are gorgeous, it is certainly one of the prettiest editions I've seen. However, the story was all over the place and lacked flow.On one side of the page a few paragraphs are captured by a border, and the opposite page has a full color painting making for a delightful story to read to your little one. I do feel the book is too challenging for emerging readers, but might be more appropriate as a book to read to Preschool thru 1st grade, with 2nd graders reading it on their own.My daughter enjoyed reading this book with me. I would recommend this book for libraries."
2,Be careful when ordering,"The Molinsky et al Word by Word Dictionaries are great, even better are the workbooks that go along with them. Be careful when ordering this item - this is not the workbook that goes with the new edition of the dictionary, it goes with the old edition. The page numbers are different, and some of the vocabulary is different as well. If you buy this workbook, you'll have to doctor the exercises to go along with the pages in the new dictionary, or explain to your students. Kind of a pain!"
3,Ripoff,"The card is fine, but you don't have to buy the RCA. Any CompactFlash card will work in the Lyra, and for just $50 more you can get 128MB, or more than two and a half times the storage on this card."
5,Lots of memory on a little card,The flash card is great because I can use it in my Hewlett Packard Pocket PC and in the RCA MP3 player. This versitility is really what sold me. Plus the Flash card is not flimsy like the smaller multi-media cards that most MP3's use. I recently took a road tip where I had over 16 hours of audio on a 48MB card with room left over for some MP3s.
1,dont buy Interact products,"Ive bought 2 memory cards, an N64 controller, a N64 gameshark, Gameshark CDX for plsaystation, another gameshark for the playstation...all have had problems and stopped working within a year. The GS ruined my N64, the GS CDX ruined my PS1, Another gameshark for the original playstation ruined it, and the memory cards quit working within a year. Do not waste your money on Interact products and accessories unless you like seeing your $200 consoles turned into a doorstop. Take it from someone with experience."
4,supermax / london aircraaft,"Album shared. Only way to access Supermax Fly with me, the best album recorded by the european band. Unfortunately you can not get this disc individually. An outstanding collection of rock, disco, reggae, funk and psychedelia, Indispensable. Bring two bonus tracks in relation to the original. No remastering, so that the sound of this issue, in my opinion, is too low. Super recommended for fans of Supermax. Its combination with Rockets, innentendible, , unnecessary. I repeat: Fly with me, excellent work, very little known"
3,Love them But....,"I love these shoes, but I reccomend getting them atleast 1.5 to 2 sizes bigger. They can be rather tight if you get your exact size."
3,Sizing issue,"I usually wear a size 9, but I had read several online reviews that said they ran very small, so I ordered two pair in a size 10. Big mistake, they are HUGE and the retailer I ordered them from (a retailer not from Amazon) didn't have a good exchange program, so I am essentially stuck with two pairs of shoes that I can never wear."
4,"Overall, not bad","When I first ordered these I ignored some of the reviews I had seen about the shoes and got a size seven because that's what the chart said my size should be but I was wrong to ignore the reviews, the sizing is really small on these shoes so order a size up. Other than that I really like the shoes. The color is great and they are very comfortable!"
4,order a size up - you won't be disappointed,"I purchased these for my wife. She wears an 8 but they were too small. Returning them was fairly simple. A 9 fit perfectly. They look VERY sexy on and it was tough for her to have them on for a dinner date, but with a 5"" heel it's pretty obvious what look you're going for. Expect looks of admiring looks from both men and women."
2,Sexy but too narrow,"I was excited to wear these with a costume this month, but I won't be able to. They ARE very sexy and the length of the shoe is true to size but it is VERY narrow up by the toes and I don't have wide feet. Shame, really. They would have been great!"
2,Order big!,"I love the vibrant color of these shoes, but they were too small and I didn't have time to return them before the event I purchased them for. I suspect they'd be pretty uncomfortable even in the right size. I just needed them for one night, so they did the job, but the construction and quality were fairly poor."
3,definately run small,these shoes are very cute they definately run small i wear a 10 ordered an 11 and fit great. However they are such a big heel that it makes the shoe very steep. I could not walk in them and i wear heels all the time.
2,Cute but very uncomfortable on the toes!,"I bought this shoe to complete my Halloween costume and they were perfect, until I put them on. I bought my size 9 as always, but the shoe pinched my toes seriously. I had to leave the costume party early and take the shoes off in the parking lot. I was happy with my costume though, very cute."
4,Nice high heels for the price,"These shoes run small, very small. So shop accordingly. If you get them in the right size, they are surprisingly comfortable to walk in considering the height of the heel. Quality is average and I don't expect them to last particularly long - you get what you paid for, these are not Manolo Blahniks by any stretch of the imagination. On the other hand, since they are cheap, you can get a few pairs in various colors."
5,LOVE! but runs small,"Ok so my shoe size is 5 1/2 and I bought size 6, they fit perfect! the color is as in picture. heel height is 4 1/2, they are just perfect, the perfect barbie shoe hehe."
2,Pleaser Women's Seduce Pumps,"In spite of my efforts to select the proper shoe size, these shoes were extremely painful on my feet. I bought them for a very important event and suffered the entire day I wore them.My suggestion to others who are interested is to buy this shoe at least 1 size larger than what your normal shoe size may be. Perhaps they will fit with much more comfort."
5,Great Picture Quality,"This widescren HDTV puts out 1080i/720p/480p/480i not all HDTV do this and this is important since alot of material right now is 480i-standard cable, 480p-most dvd's and many games, 720p/1080i-Hight Defintion shows or movies, some games and more games later will support this true HD option also. Plamsas are great but after doing reserch the hours they last is less than half of what a CRT will last. The minus of CRT they are pretty heavy and not thin. This TV is heavy but includes 2 handles at the side so it isn't that bad moving it. This TV and the 910 sony are 2 of the best CRT direct view sets out, I went with this one since it was like $400 cheaper and from about 8 feet away this tv had better brights, while the 910 when you got closer you could see the higher resolution but I don't sit that close to my a 34 inch tv, 8 ft is fine for me."
4,Excellent Choice!,"A bit pricey but worth it. This TV is excellent. Has incredible picture quality and the sound is outstanding. Beats out the competition without question. Very easy to use including the remote. Love the Pic in Pic option along with all the viewing options: full view, zoom, widescreen zoon and regular screen. Wonderful choice for a television."
1,Not a great choice...,"Stay away from this player. I recently purchased one and had to return it within a few days. The player was unable to read half of my store-bought DVD collection, often would not read sound unless I went into the sound setup menu and backed out again, and had a tendency to skip chapters during playback. When returning the unit, even the salesman told me to avoid Coby and try a different manufacturer. If you are looking for a low priced secondary DVD player, do yourself a favor and invest a few more dollars to get one of greater quality. The time and hassles you save will be well worth the slightly greater price."
2,VGA output has a defect,"I bought two of these soley for its VGA output, a very unusual feature among DVD players.Unfortunately, both exhibited the same flaw: with around half my DVD collection, 20 bright white lines would gradually cycle on and then off in the upper-left portion of my monitor. These DVDs would cause no problems in any other player, and the monitor doesn't show difficulties with other VGA output--so I'm confident it's the Coby's fault.If anyone knows how to fix this, I'd very much appreciate info at Coby@customres.sent.com. If I can't fix them soon, they're going back...will update with another review if I manage to fix them."
1,Junk,"Bought one of these four days ago.Plugged in according to manual.Loaded DVD. Music and picture but no voices.Selected ""Audio"" to attempt to get voices.Picture and all sound went away for good.Operation restricted to opening and closing drawer, watching display. No output.Returned to store for refund.Don't buy one of these.It's a really small neat looking piece of junk."
4,Very functional,"This is perfect for my needs. The plastic seems a little chinsy, but it's exactly what I was looking for as far as function."
4,jimi sports wallet,"my son is a jock and he's constantly going from gym to work tooutdoor events, etc., and he puts $ and his driver's license inthis wallet, and stores the rest in his locked car. This wayhe doesn't have to bring his wallet, with credit cards, money,etc., to the gym where he works out. He really likes it."
4,Best Wallet ever,The pure black one is a bit boring. The slightly transparent ones are better.Perfect size and keeps your pockets organised. Does not buldge.
2,not that impressed,"several people recommended this to me - I wanted a small, thin wallet for just the basics. I got this last week and have been trying hard to make it work for me. It does what it says it does but I just don't think it's practical for me. I now have it as a back up for my business cards and I'm hoping I can make friends with it in the next few weeks or one of my friends will be getting a jimi wallet. The problem for me is that the lid doesn't really snap on or off easily - it takes a bit of an effort to align the top so it snaps closed again, then when it's open and you try to get at the credit cards, the plastic holder snaps off too easily. Maybe I'm doing it wrong but several times when I've been standing in line trying to get into my wallet, I end up with several pieces of the wallet in my hands along with my change and that's just not practical IMO.I got the red one and the color is really nice - but the cover gets scratched really easy."
2,Pretty flimsy,"This little plastic wallet is like a cheap give-a-way at a trade show. It is made of thin hard plastic and it clips together fine but I certainly wouldn't call it very water resistant. I got this to carry cash in my pocket while wading through deep water on a cave hike in Belize. After opening it there is no way I would trust it to keep water out in these conditions, so I used my waterproof iPhone case instead. I'm not really sure what good use this thing would have."
2,"cool idea, but slows you down","I carried this wallet for a week or so before giving up on it. I like that it's solid and small in my pocket, but I couldn't fit as much as I needed to in it. Getting my debit card in and out was much slower than with my usual billfold. If you start out the day with a couple 20's you're fine until you start gathering smaller bills - they won't fit. My business cards don't quite fit and got dinged up. The hinge is just a weak, thin strip of plastic. The plastic looks and feels cheap."
3,grandma,I think it is OK I havn't given them to my Grandkids yet....I will let you know after I give it to them.
1,"The bulky, akward object for people who hate putting bulky, awkward objects into their pockets","This ""wallet"" is marketed towards people who hate wallets.Alliance Sterling Ergonomically Correct Rubber Bands, #107, 0.625 x 7 Inches, 50 per 1lb Box (25075)is the original wallet for people who hate wallets. Your local grocery store is having a promotion right now, buy a head of broccoli get the original wallet for people who hate wallets for FREE!"
3,Women At War,"Describes the feminine side of nursing in Vietnam War, a time ""when people grew up fast"", too fast. Gives personal accounts, factual,and enlightening and disheartening at the same time."
1,"Horrible, did not work at all............................","This charger did not work with my phone, I have the Sony Ericsson z520 and it would not work with my phone, thats what I get for trying to take the cheap route, my grandma always told me you get what you pay for.... Don not order this............................"
3,Not for the Lyra 2,The case and accessories are good and reasonably well-made. This will not fit the Lyra 2 but looks to be an exact fit for the older Lyra.
1,Way too brief...,"""SUCCESSFUL SKETCHING"" by Valerie Wiffen:I rate Valerie Wiffen's book only 1 star. At only 128 pages, the book covers not just ""sketching"" per se, but everything else related to sketching, but in BRIEF; there's brief architectural sketching, brief flower sketching, brief portraiture, brief figure sketching, and even brief still life. With such cursory treatment of each subject, how could anyone hope for success?The illustrations were uninspiring, and I found the overall flow of the book to be broken and disjointed from chapter to chapter. It's too short and requires expansion and more illustration. There are other, more thorough books on the market."
4,nice Set-Up,"This adaptor set up was good quality. It worked quite well. I'm addicted to MP3's and so this was definately a good purchase for me. It would have been nicer if the tape player on my car hadn't died before I got good use out of, but don't worry...I'm getting it fixed! I definately recommend this for other MP3 freaks like myself"
4,"Sturdy, attractive glasses","I purchased these because of the price and the fact that they were not glass.They're attractive and colorful, have a good weight and can be stacked to store.I'm hesitant to put them in the dishwasher so only gave them 4 stars."
1,Flimsy and cracks easily,"These were given to me as a gift a few months ago (2 sets of the 13 oz and 1 set of the 18 oz). Half of what I have cracked down the side after gentle use after only a few months. I use them for cold/cool beverages and wash them by hand, never in dishwasher. I am very disappointed in the way these held up."
1,Not what I'd hoped for.,"This song book is for use with harpsichords and handbells. The harpsichord cues are at the top of the staff and easy to see. The handbell cues are under the staff and it's harder to read them because they're cluttered with the notes. Also, this book is NOT color-coded to go along with the colored handbells. I had to go in with a colored pencil and put the correct colored dot next to each note. Many of the songs are not familiar, but there are old favorites such as Kum By Ya, Jingle Bells, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, etc. I gave my 7-year-old nephew this book along with the colored handbells and he did very well right off the bat, but only because I took the time to color-code the book myself. Buyer beware."
3,8 Note Bell Song Book.,"I was a little disappointed that the notes were not color coded in the book. I purchased this for my grandson who is going to be 5 and thought he would enjoy learning how to play. Now I am not sure how this is going to work and will have to go through the book and color code everything for hi,."
3,Song Book,"Kind of a strange collection of songs, several that I'm not familiar with, and many that my daughter will not be. Also, I didn't realize that there would be several forms of musical notation for each song- I'm afraid it will be confusing. I do plan to go through with colored pencils and color code everything to her bells, so that should help.All in all, I had hoped for something more child-friendly. But for the price, I can sure work with it!!"
3,"Good plot, wierd execution","I read ""Gossamyr"" on the plane while I was away on business, so I was forced to finish it or stare mindlessly out the window. It wasn't bad. It's got a good storyline and interesting characters, and it's not so obvious as other Luna books I've read.I had trouble getting into the author's world, though. For example, the slang creation bothered me. (Bone? Why not just use a different, easily recognizable word instead of creating something sort of useless to the story and then having to explain it?) It would be one thing if it was a different language, but it seemed sort of pointless.I also hadn't read ""Seraphim"" so I realized, as I got through the book, that I was missing some obvious character connections that were revealed. However, I wasn't sufficiently intrigued by ""Gossamyr"" to want to run out and pick up the first novel in the series.Not my favorite Luna book, but not one I would want to throw out the window either."
1,Thesaurus Abuse,"I couldn't finish this due to the the purple prose, and it seems like the author is typing with one hand...and holding a thesaurus in the other. Sorry, no thanks. I'll stick with authors that don't write so pretentiously."
1,SCAM,"I ordered the Pimsleur Quick and Simple French 2nd Revised Edition. A few weeks later (after I had received, but not yet unwrapped my initial purchase, I received an unsolicited box of 18 more CDs accommpanied by the statement ""Congratulations! Your enrollment in the Rapid Fluency Program has been accepted"". ""You have a Gold 30 Day Free Trial"" which I had never requested. I was told I would have ""30 days to Try Free and return the item if I didn't want it"". It's my understanding that there is no obligatiion to return, or make arrangements to return, unsolicited items received by mail or delivere otherwise to you address. I don't want to have to deal with this. Has anyone else experienced this?"
1,Minimally useful,"This set of tapes is essentially a drill in repetition and memorization. For example, in the first lesson (out of eight lessons), spend 1/2 and hour learning a handful of phrases by listening to the french and english translation being repeated over and over again. Each tape is like that: handful of phrases, lots of repetition. The benefit is that you won't forget these phrases; also you will get a good sense of what the language should sound like. The downside is much more: you won't learn anything about grammer, or the written language... in fact, you won't learn much at all. Over all, I would not recommend this."
1,This course was a complete waste of money,"I have tried many other French tape sets, and this one is, by far, the worst one I've ever tried. I listened to the first 2 out of 4 tapes in the set. Each tape is an hour in length. In the two hours that I played the tapes the only thing they covered was how to say: ""I speak French"", ""I speak a little French"",""Do you speak French?"", ""Do you speak English?"", ""Hello"", ""How are you?"" I played these tapes in the car with my other relatives and after 10 minutes people were either laughing with me or yelling at me to turn the tapes off. If you want to learn some basic French that you can learn by tape, I suggest Barron's ""Getting by in French;"" it's fun, costs half the price of Pimsleur's, uses half the number of tapes to cover 100 times the information you need for very basic French."
4,So far so Good!!!!,"We purchased the tent because my husband wanted a rain fly that went all the way to the ground for added protection. We took it on a trip to the Southeast and camped very comfortably! It is big enough to fit our air mattress and leave some room for stuff on the sides!! We also took it on a canoe trip and it rained buckets on us, but stayed totally dry and so did the main part of the tent!!! So far so good!!! We love it!! And the tent poles are a cool copper color and I love that!"
2,Terrible in dusty environment,"This tent sure is easy to setup, but it's absolutely horrible in a dusty and windy environment. Dirt/dust get pushed up the wall of the tent (under the rainfly),then fall through the side windows into the tent. After a day in Death Valley, the inside of the tent was covered in very very fine dust.Also, the door design if pretty awkward.It's impossible to open the rainfly from the inside without staying in the tent with the door fully open... Of course, as soon as to do get the rainfly open, outside element get in :-("
5,ALPS Mountaineering Taurus 4 Person,"I didn't have much time to read reviews and select a tent. I just knew that I had to have a tent with a full coverage rain fly, and I needed it in one day. Much to my relief, it came in time and I was off to the woods on a 10 day camp out. I was very happy with the tent when I saw the quality of the poles and the materials. It is easy to set up and it has room to spare for my gear and me. I have now spent 18 nights in the tent and weathered a few good rain storms with no leaks. I didn't have any wind to speak of, but it looks like it should be quite stable because of the four anchor ropes and the rigidity of the aluminum poles. I placed a folded up plastic tarp underneath the tent just to protect the floor."
5,An Absolute Delight,"This group is a new discovery for me. The musicality of their work is remarkable. Multi-layered and rich. A beautiful mix of guitar and percussion marks each track. That voice, Wow, what a soft crisp tone. The music takes it's time and unfurls like thread from a spool. Great music for a roadtrip."
1,Slimy brown bacteria develops in 2 weeks,"Not good idea to use as pre-filter coz it will spoil others in chain. Slimy brown bacteria develops in 2 weeks because of the combination of 2 organic materials (carbon & cellulose). Will not fit tight, because the inner hall is to wide."
2,Good way to treat water,I have been using these carbon cartridges for many years. They are very effective for eliminating sediments and odors. Have to replace them every 3 months.
5,Very nice!,"It's a nice puzzle, very dificult, have a lot of strange-shaped peaces, but still it is a lot of fun and hope to have it done by end of this month ;)"
1,What A Mess!,"We had just finished a Sunsout puzzle ""Parrots in Paradise"" and it was great! Very high quality and fun to put together. We were looking forward to this Sunsout puzzle and opened it immediately upon receipt. WHAT A MESS! The pieces were very thin and cheaply made. There was puzzle ""dust"" everywhere and 5 of the pieces were delaminated; the picture part had separated from the cardboard bottom layers. There were pieces that had not been completely cut through and were permanently stuck together and other pieces partly delaminated and others with damaged interconnecting parts. We boxed it up and returned it for a refund."
3,Not what I expected,"After having this for a few years I can say that my son enjoyed watching plain salt crystals grow on wool yarn a lot more than he did watching the crystals form from this kit. The kit solution takes a while to dry/form so there are weeks of no change. When crystals do form they are flat, unlike the picture on the box."
1,Soccer Shoe is Vinyl,I was trying to find a new pair of Puma soccer shoes that I had already owned and wore out after 2 years of playing soccer in them. These are not it! They are vinyl (even though the marketplace seller claims they are leather.) Disappointed!
2,There is a lot of Jabber documentation out there,I have read some of this book and I don't like it that much. I personally feel the author spends too much time with things that are pretty easy to compress.Looking backwards I think the Jabber documentation is enough to write an IM client. I wrote one for alarming purposes. This is the first edition and the book has plenty of errors in the text. ( The code samples seem to be O.K.). Obviously the author was so busy pushing out his book that he didn't let anyone proofread it.I would recommend to buy another book ( there are plenty ) or rely on the Jabber documentation and the plenty of samples the web has to offer.
1,Carcinogen,"I purchased two of these cassette players to use in my first grade classroom. The first thing I noticed after opening the package was that there is NO REWIND BUTTON! I read the instructions word for word and there is no way to rewind cassettes. Also, there is a warning on the headphones that says the coated electrical wire of this product contains a substance known to the state of California to be a carcinogen or reprodutive toxicant.....wash hands after handling. California proposition 65."
5,Great Drive & Software,"It's quieter than the PC's drive but slightly more noisy than my laptop's. As for the quality, I've had it two months with no problems.The software is great too. The only problem is that it doesn't let you select a whole directory tree to backup and then let you DE-select sub-folders. In other words, if you want to backup something other than your whole C drive, for example, you will have to go through and select sub-trees individually. Other than that, I've had no problems, it backs up on schedule and even keeps different versions of files as defined in the settings.It requires a seperate power supply so I only reccomend it for desktop use.P. S. Make sure you reformat it NTFS before using because it comes with FAT32."
5,Great little drive,Very quiet and with XP no software installation is required. Plus it has an on/off switch witch is very nice to have so it's not on all the time. I would buy it again. I've had it for about 2 months and have had no problems with it.
4,External Hard Drive,"I use this external hard drive to backup important files, and I take it on trips for storing large image files which I transfer from a laptop. It works smoothly and rapidly, just plug it in and go. No complaints from me - it does what I need without a hassle. I'm no expert when it comes to plug-ins, external hard drives, etc.; so, my experience with this Iomega drive has been a good one. Highly recommended for its quality and value. I've generall had good experiences with Iomega products, and this one is no exception."
5,Plug and Play,"I bought this external drive for my sister. On paper, it met her needs perfectly - compact, robust, fast and a reasonable price per gigabyte (particularly after the mail in rebate). Installing it was a snap and it's working like a charm. Worth the money."
2,Good if you are familiar with OO concepts,"I bought this book with the expectation that I could learn the basics of the Java programming langauge. I think this book would be fine if you have a good object oriented background. However coming from a VB/LotusScript background with basic OO understanding I found that once I started getting into the Inheritance and then the Interfaces section I was finding it difficult to grasp the concepts. Also the example exercises seem to assume that you can take the knowledge learnt in the chapter and be able to write your own code from scratch, short of looking at the answers and learning little I found this book dissappointing, I think there needs to be more example code especially on the more difficult concepts and further explanation on these areas."
1,Dont waste your money!,"I dont know why this book has got so many good reviews.After reading the book, I get the feeling that the author was not sure about a lot of concepts. I find a lot of contradictory statements here. Buy something like the Java Cookbook."
5,One of my favs,"This Gandalf is awesome,a highlight out of all my 65 Lord of the rings figures.The gandalf the white figure is way better than the Fellowship gandalf the gray whose face doesnt even look like Ian mckellans,but the gandalf the whites face looks so much like ians its scary.I love this figure and im almost sure you will love it too."
3,"Some areas outdated by September, 1999","We found that some of the walking tours in Budapest were outdated and difficult to follow. (We toured 9 other locations using other travel books, not frommers, with minimal problem) Elements could not be reached due to changing areas. Cautions regarding closings or operating hours were not accurate. Language was not a problem since one of the 4 of us could speak fluent Hungarian."
1,Dissapointed,I bought the item for the price- as it was cheap- but the strap broke as I took it out of the box. Smells funny as well.
1,Nagging odor,As soon as it came out of the box I was hit with a strong odor of treated leather and some other chemical smell I don't want to think about (perhaps formaldahyde). Will have to see if I can spray something on it to get rid of the odor. Handle and zippers look like they will not last six months.
5,Love it,Came in a timely matter and holds more than I thought it would. I would recommend to anyone. Lightweight and also comes with a shoulder strap
3,It looks like a purse,"I'm sorry but it smelled like chemicals, not leather... yes it does appear to be leather because the smell when you put your nose up to it IS leather... however, a glaring issue for me is that it looks like a purse. I am not phobic by any means.. I have a travel pouch I use with concealed weapon as the law permits but I'm telling you even in a business suit, this looks too much like I raided my wife's closet full of purses and came out with one of my wife's many Latina purses..(yes, she is Venezuelan and Latin).The quality seems fine, it just isn't for me due to mostly the purse ""like"" appearance..."
2,briefcase,"This briefcase is very nice, but stinks to high heaven. It's taken me and my husband doing multiple things to get the stinch out."
4,Perfect for our needs,I've been trying so long to find a great lightweight briefcase that has enough pockets to accommodate me that I almost gave up. This is the perfect suitcase for our needs.
2,Get what you pay for,"You can see pictures on internet , cannot smell and feel a product. This one does smell bad. It is still in my garage."
4,Nice bag - Great Price,"This is a great bag for the price. I needed a light weight bag to carry a few papers and my computer. It fits the bill. Some have complained about the smell. After all it is lambskin and the ""smell"" is just a leathery smell that goes away quickly. I have recommended this bag to my friends."
5,Very Satisfied,"Great briefcase for the price. I'm a Minister of Music and I carry lots of paper, CD's, DVD's, Calendar, Cell phone and I even use it for my laptop at times. I plan to buy at least one or two more to have on hand as long as it remains at that low price. Unbeatable bargin"
2,"Great Looks, Strange Smell","I actually ordered this for my grandson, who wants to dress as a businessman for Halloween. I was pleasantly surprised at the price (never thought I could get leather at such a reasonable price)and it looks great, but it has a really strange smell. I tried everything to get rid of that odor, even keeping it on my back patio for a few days. When we eventually visited our grandchildren, no one else seemed to mind the smell as much as I did. Maybe it was the dye or something, but I didn't want it in my house."
1,Terrible. Returned it.,"Total waste of money. I returned it right away. Leather looks terrible and is paper thin (if it even is real leather). ""Leather"" is pieced together to look kind of retro (I think), but it looks like it was just made with remnants. Do no bother with this product."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Great for the price. I wanted a leather case to keep certain papers together, and purchased it because of the great price. You may not know from the picture that it is a patchwork of leather scraps sewn together. The zipper on the top does not completely seal the the main compartment so small items might fall out, but books and pads would not. I like the zipper compartments on the sides. You can put pens and so on in those compartments and they won't fall out. I ended up with two of them and gave one to a friend. He loves his, and uses it all day every day for books and papers. He is wheelchair bound but finds it perfect for carrying things. His was just damaged on an airplane flight, so he asked me for the ordering information and ordered a replacement!"
4,I like it!,"When I first got the case, it had a very strong chemical smell that lasted for a while - not a leather smell. However, other than that it was perfect for the price I paid for it ... what do you expect for less than $25.00. I've had it several years and it's getting quite torn up now ... the smell has long since disappeared. I have shoved so much into this little case, I'm surprised it didn't fall apart earlier ... I like it so much I ordered another one today ..."
3,It's a useful bag,"I was skeptical about this bag given it's price vs. my expectations for leather. While it's by no means a ""hard"" leather bag, it certainly looks,its big enough to handle my daily work items and it comes over classy enough fit in with business attire.I have a genuine concerned when I see ""Genuine Leather"" followed by made in China (no disrespect to the Chinese).All in all, it's worth it for the $20 bucks (at this point)."
2,you get what you pay for #...,"This bag is real leather (although it is leather pieces stitched together), but the quality of the bag overall is very low. I would not call it a good deal because the bag also looks cheap (cheaper than on the pictures). Rather than spending $20 on this cheap piece of c$#&, add another $20-40 and buy something less embarassing. I am giving two stars because it is leather. Although for $50-60, you can find something synthetic that will look better and last longer."
2,Nice case but smells,Case is made of assorted pieces of leather but is nicely done. Pungent odor is emitted from the case and is still present 1 month after purchase.
2,Smells Bad,"Pros:-Cheap-Looks ok (kinda girlish though)Cons:-SMELLS HORRIBLE (the smell lingers also, may have infected my work-suit)-Made of goat leather ?!?I've returned this, not sure if I'll get my money back or not, but I don't care because I got rid of the horrible source of the smell; although the smell still lingers in my apartment."
3,Shipping Costs!!!,"Product is fine; it's been on the shelf 25 years or more. I ordered 3 cans. Shipping costs exceeded product cost making a very expensive ordeal. I had ordered another product which came from another vendor, so that handling costs for the Right Guard were somewhat camouflaged. Ridiculous. I didn't expect this tactic from Amazon but now I'll scrutinize more thoroughly."
5,"Right Guard Sport Deodorant Aerosol, Original - 3 OZ",This was great I found the product that I was looking for and good buy them at a better price then the store.
5,beutiful clear voice,We need more of Jodi Shaw. Her lyrics are crazy but you have to stop what you are doing to listen to ber clear voice. the songs about love are inspiring.
5,Amazingly helpful,This is a very positive read. The great thing about it is it only takes a few minutes to read each day. The weird thing about it is more often then not it is exactly what I needed to hear on that day to give me a more positive outlook for the day.
2,BE VERY CAREFUL before buying Iomega product,"Be careful. I've spent 4 hours in 'live chat' with their technical support to make this thing work. And it won't do what I need it to do. First, be careful -- it must be plugged directly into the wall socket(it won't work plugged into a power strip) and it needs a main USB port in the back of your computer unit (front, side, or alternate USB ports won't work -- less power to alternate USB ports they said). And the you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it. According to Iomega tech support, Iomega doesn't have any product that backs up another computer over a network. Be careful. This is accurate -- but other printed things by Iomega don't pan out."
2,A Subpar Work Of Fiction,"But, as they always say, don't let the truth get in the way of a good story."
5,"Great Book, It Kept Me So Interested!","For all of us who love Ghosts, Vampires, Voodoo, and all that good stuff, then this is the book to read. If you live in New Orleans or not, it is a great book. I really enjoyed the many famous and not famous ghost stories of New Orleans. The parts on Voodoo were extremely intersting. It kept my interest because it told me about a religion I never new about. The vampire portion of the book taught me about Vampires and things I never knew, or would have even thought about. This book provoked thought and interest. I love it and I give it five stars. It is a tantalizing piece of literature which I would recommend for anyone to read, new ager or not, New Orleans resient or not! It was great."
2,Horribly Written,"The stories about the locations in this book are decent, however, I would have liked more background information and detail. The author seems a bit out there and kept putting her outlandish comments in, where I would have liked more objectiveness."
1,Boo-hoo: don't get this unless you want to be disappointed,"Darn it. I thought this pan would be perfect for my man-friend who needed a large roasting pan for ribs and brisket. I specifically put out the additional money as a special birthday present, because of the Calphalon name and also for the nonstick rack it came with. Unfortunately, with only it's second use for slow-cooking ribs (we are talking under 250 degree oven), the non-stick coating on the rack completely bubbled and separated from the metal. Only mild dish soap was used to clean after the first use, so why would this happen with a supposed quality, high-priced product? I don't think I will be trusting this brand again. <sigh>"
5,Calphalon Classic Nonstick Roaster with Domed Lid and Nonstick Flat Rack,"I like the Calphalon Classic Nonstick Roaster with Domed Lid and Nonstick Flat Rack. It works very well with very even heating, size wise is big enough to handle a very large Thanksgiving turkey and extras. It's built solid.This roster is easier to clean then others I have used. I'm very happy with my purchase and have used the roster at least a dozen times."
3,Great Pictorial,"Nice pictures. Good coffee table book for a guest to your home that might share a love for football or the Broncos. The quality pictures are what makes this book. If you are looking for an in-depth look into the life of Elway, you would need to look elsewhere."
5,check book cover,The checkbook covers I get from my credit union are flimsy and fall apart easily. This one is sturdier - as well as having the Bronco logo.
3,stick to the orignal,"This film while having some of the same ideas as the original series/book sadly departed from the greatness that made it (the original) a good show/book. Yes i understand that in order to take a 7ish 8ish part series and boil it down to the dregs of ""what is needed to tell the story"" would ruin some of the magic of the whole thing...but they could have left a lot of it there and not changed the whole thing with added monsters in the whole mix. But guess that needed to be added in to ""explain"" more of the idea then they could..idk. The movie was good but left me wanting to see the original again."
2,Aweful movie,"I was completely un-entertained while watching this movie. The movie starts out slow, continues slow, and at the end, was very anticlimactic. The entire movie is about one boy who has a chip on his shoulder (attitude problem) until the last 10-15 minutes of the film. His cousin is more level headed but although it is not poorly acted, was just unentertaining.I expected more from an accomplished actor like Sam Neill.Truly, you will spend the entire film thinking, ""get on with it!"" then at the very end, in a rushed fashion, our heroes somehow save the day and a few special effects are thrown in.I do not recommend this film to buy or even rent. Unless your a huge New Zealand fan. The opening credits appeared to be all by low budget, NZ promos. If a specific region is going to make a movie, don't make all the advertising, trailers, etc for your people only. If you want your movie liked on an international level, you have to appeal to more than one demographic."
1,Don't Buy This Movie,"I wish there had been reviews before I bought this movie. I didn't like it, my children didn't like it and my grandkids didn't like it, what more can you say, it was pretty stupid. What a waste of money!"
5,Terrific Book! :-),"Book arrived in great shape...I chose this book because I have a dear friend going thru this situation, and wanted to be able to understand what she's going through. This book was recommeded to me and I am looking forward to finishing it. Thanks"
5,Fantastic!,Difficult questions resolved with the book! I do not feel so isolated with the problems of care giving for FTD.
2,Not the book for Lewy Body Demetia,"I was looking for a book that would cover Lewy Body Dementia, the second-most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's. This wasn't it. There is a small section on LBD, but the main emphasis is on Frontotemporal dementia. Far more information, and more specific and up-to-date information on Lewy Body dementia is available on the internet from the LBD association."
2,Poor Quality Print,I was very dissappointed with the poor picture quality of this print.I can't believe that Ray's cinematography had such messed up brightsand darks. It spoils what appears to be a fine movie.
5,"A subtle, nuanced, deeply moving film","I admire S.Ray's films enormously and find this movie one of his finest. His ability to evoke a mood brings the viewer into the story and the hearts of the characters. The performances, especially Madhabi Mukherjee's, are also outstanding. This is not, though, a movie for people who like fast paced action."
1,Disappointing.,As an admirer of this director's films I was disappointed at the poor video and sound and unsynchrynised subtitles.
4,A Gem!,"Despite the poor quality of images, one can still understand why this is a collectible.The sharpness and attention to detail in this film speak volumes. The cast is well-chosen and Ray's eye for focus on subtle body language is what sold it to me.I say ""great film"" along with Ray's Music Room."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!!,"The book is not up to date. Web site is not working.They tell you to send a self-addressed envelope for coupons, and after two weeks, the UPS return it to me with a note: the address is not longer valid. Do not give your money away!!!"
3,DEnatives,"Have been playing Tiger Woods Golf for years. This year was such a disappointment from the play aspect. My husband and I played together, being a guest on each others careers. The only way to play together is the play now option. This makes it a singular effort to complete your career matches. It seems to me all ps3 games are more geared to playing online instead of playing with friends. Why do we have to loose that aspect just to get better graphics? The game face has been overhauled and is more realistic and you can even load a picture of yourself. Change the way modifers are applied to your player. They brought back the 3 click (when you had the bar to swing with)"
2,Not as good as TIger Woods 2007,"This game was rushed.I've played every version since 04, and this one is the first that didn't improve from the previous version.Pros:1. Improved graphics2. Improved sound3. Improved Tiger WOods CHallengeCons:1. Slowdown, inconsistent frame rate2. Controls are horrible unless you are on the easiest difficulty setting3. Commentary has nearly the same dialogue as 06 and 07.Here's hoping TW09 isn't rushed, too."
3,It's... Okay,"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is a fair game. The graphics are very nice on the PS3 (especially with HD cables) and the gameplay is very simulation-like. As a veteran of Mario Golf and Hot Shots Golf (Everybody's Golf, in Japan) I am more or less used to the 3 button push shot type, in which you press X once to start the swing, again to chose power, and again to decide accuracy. This shot control is avalable in TWPGAT 08, but it automatically starts you with the right- analog stick swing control (once again, it makes it more sim - like) This is fine, but it makes it too easy. Anyways, below are the scores:Graphics...... 5/5Gameplay...... 4/5Control....... 3/5Features...... 3/5******OVERALL....... 3/5 (Okay)Stick with what you know!"
3,Needs changing,"Gabe and Tycho said it best. It sucks that you have to play hundreds of hours to make computer Tiger Woods like Tiger Woods. You have to unlock everything before the game becomes any fun at all. I dont have the time or the patience to commit to that kind of time when I should be working on my REAL LIFE GOLF SWING!!! When I buy a golf video game I shouldnt have to work harder than I do in real life at golf.In real life I can hit 300yd drives. In Tiger Woods Golf how many hours and wins do I have to stack up before a driver will pass 275yds???? I can hit that with my 3WOOD!I love the graphics, and I love playing video game golf on a rainy day when I cant do the real thing... but I HATE paying so much money for a game I have to UNLOCK to have fun with. [...]"
4,ok game,"Nice game, but the default control mechanism sucks. Every time, I have to change it to the 3-click method. Also, my thumb isn't used to 3-click, so I think it would be easier to play the game with a mouse."
2,Big Letdown!,"The graphics are admittedly very good as expected. However, the gameplay is downright awful! I've owned versions for the past three years on ps2, snd liked them all, but the new one for ps3 is so unplayable. I don't like the play set-up and the controls are too difficult! I was besting all of tiger's top scores in '06, and now i'm lucky to four putt! And, I can't advance past anyone because I can't even get a drive in the fairway."
2,Stays in the shallow end,"I was introduced to Ten Mile Tide by a friend who thought that my pop-rock side might be appealed to by this band. Unfortunately, the lyrics lack the depth that I tend to enjoy in music. The vocals can sound pleasing at times, until you listen to what is coming out of them. It's too much story with too little plot for lyrics. If you're the kind of person who just likes music in general, these guys might fit in well for your taste. If you're even the least bit picky, you'll find lots too pick on. It's just too simple, and too uninspired."
1,The graphics and illustrations add NO value.,"The graphics, illustrations and figures add no value to the book. They confuse the reader and distract their attention away from the authors points. I would not recommend reading this book unless the graphics were removed."
2,"Okay, but a few machines didn't like this card at all","I've put this card in a few machines that needed a dedicated ethernet connection and it worked great, others just will not work. Hit and miss."
3,Whoever said beauty is painless,"This shoe is definitely an attention grabber. Super sexy, but the straps around your toes will feel like they're suffocating (if you don't have narrow feet). I've only worn mine about 4 times. Cute, but not an all day shoe by all means."
2,The Grotesque - Truth that Sounds Like Fiction,"One of the constant tones in reading Holocaust memoirs is their unrelenting objectivity from the people who went through this terrible experience in their description of events. They are neither bitter or hateful, but simply telling what happened. Unfortunately, I did not consider the style of the writing in this book had conveyed this feeling, it appears to be disjointed, it jumps backwards, and forwards which made it difficult to follow. Possibly the problem was with the translation, through which the author's tone was lost. Some of the events that were describe have been told before with different nationalities, and identities ... that is to be expected."
4,Grotesque Is an Understatement,"But if you want to really understand how and what happened to people in the 'advanced, cultured, sophisticated 20th century"", it's a good book to read. Appalling, but crucial read to understand how truly brutal the conditions were in Europe (not just at this one camp). Disturbing, but as such topics go--a 'good read'. We just can't let this happen again (and must stop what's happening now)."
3,Fact mixed with Myth? I don't know,"Initially captivated by the terrifying blandness of the horror of Auschwitz, I became somewhat disengaged at the narration of events that seemed altogether inconsistent with the general material of the book and even a touch synthetic. For instance, the tale of prisoners leaning a cooking pot against human bones, and the heroic tale of a Jewish woman disarming an SS guard on arrival and shooting several others. Later in the notes it is made clear that such tales were told and retold in varying guises. And so, preferring as I do cold, verifiable factually based accounts, I am somewhat suspicious of this book. This may be because I read 'True Tales' immediately after 'Heinrich Himmler - A Life' which is all too well documented and a superb historical reference in my opinion."
5,Excellent,"This shower curtain rod arrived in good condition. In fact, the protective plastic was a bear to remove. It was easy to install. It's sturdy and it looks nice. I highly recommend."
4,Good product!,I bought it for my daughter who lives at the college dorm and uses it to hold the curtain for an open closet. It works well for that limited space . I received it promptly.
2,quite disappointing,This product came highly recommended so we decided to order despite the fact that it was not particularly well priced. Imagine the disappointment we experienced that after only a day or so the rod came crashing down. not the quality we have come to expect from reputable companies.
4,Shiny,Looks nice and matches other products that have the brushed metal look to them. The end caps seem to be a bit too hard and smooth to be great at sticking but the strength of the spring is pretty strong so it seems to make up for it. Seems durable and is working great for my 4 foot span over a shower door to keep the hot air in the shower.
1,Talk about dime store knock offs!,"This book is barely a drop in the bucket when it comes to Zeppelin. I've seen restaurant menus that are more insightful than this book. It might be great if you are a 7 year old who can't use ""big"" words, or if you don't a have an attention span over 15 minutes. Most people should just pass on this book."
5,Jesus talks to us through Saint Faustina,"Wonderful book based on the real life of a polish nan Faustina Kowalska who was made saint by pope John Paul II. When you need an answer it is there. You can just open a book randomly and read Jesus's words which are highlighted. Faustina experienced Jesus's apearances on the daily base. Jusus told her about God's mercy. He requested to have his portrait painted the way he wanted (blood and water coming out from his heart with words ""Jesus I trust in you""). He wanted to have a Sunday of God's mercy created (special day when your sins can be forgiven). None of popes have set it till John Paul II. Even if you are not religious this book is wonderful and full of answers for problems of everyday's life. LOve, patience are the answer.It is worth all the money. I highly recomend it..."
5,Wonderful!,This is a wonderful book. I have boughten many books to give out as gifts. Great evangelization tool.
4,brisk tales of a long past James Bond,"I have read three of Fender's ""Frost"" novels now, and that says something about the fact that they are enjoyable reads with characters that grow on a reader, even if they don't grow very much more complex as the books go along. They are definately not Patrick O'Brian's equals, and I wonder even if the author had them in mind as models. To me, the real parallel is to the Hornblower series, where the good guys are obviously good, the bad guys are really bad, and all too often the hero carries the day with style. So, will I read the next 2--yes, certainly--but not today. I just wish that every once in a while Captain Frost would be a little less successful--a little less of a James Bond figure."
2,Way overpriced and disappointing,There was little protection in the shipping box to keep the antennae from bending. I bought two of these for friends' hearths and was a bit disappointed in the presentation afforded.
3,Good luck cricket....,"The only problem I had was when I received the 3 I ordered, they were all in pieces. The screws had come out of most all the legs. All in all these were just as pictured.....pretty good quality."
5,Neat piece of art,"Bigger than I had expected. Just big enough to sit in the palm of your hand but not overfill it. Put together tightly, no complaints."
2,More Martin less Tarn,I was extremely disappointed in this book. The only memorable parts were those written by Prechtel. The rest is a confusing mismash of undeveloped personalities and poorly described events. I'm amazed that Tarn has such a reputation!
3,Why such tiny labeling?,"I have been using Dell keyboards for over a decade, and I can make a comparison between these two. The first thing I noticed was that the Logitech keyboard is wider and longer than the Dell; the keys are not bigger, just the overall size--a lot of empty space on the keyboard. The second thing is that the key-labeling (e.g. A, B, F2, etc.) is tiny! Dell has a nice size, whereas the Logitech is around half the size. I am not a 90-year-old grandmother who can't see. Bottom line is that it works, but could be more compact and have a larger font size for the key-labels."
2,Does not work with FFXI (Xbox 360 Version),I bought this keyboard to type in FFXI on the Xbox 360 version and it doesn't work.
2,Sturdy but uncomfortable.,"The keyboard does what it promises. It's very sturdy and looks like it will last a long time, but I have a few issues with it:The keys are very loud. Some people disagree, but this is the loudest keyboard I can recall using.Another thing that bothers me is that the keys are much harder to press than I'd like compared to previous keyboards I've used. Its a strain on my hands, but they're very small so others may not have the same problem.Another reason for this may be that it's a fairly tall keyboard with no room to rest your palms, and my hands are forced to be angled upwards. (rather than comfortably above the keys.)Maybe it's because my previous keyboard was particularly quiet and easy-to-press, but I really don't care for the features of this keyboard. It's just not comfortable for me."
5,Just good,"USB keyboard, plug and play. I didn't need to install anything. It ""Works with Vista"", however it also works with Windows XP. As mentioned in other reviews the keys of the Spacebar, Ctrl, Alt, & Windows keys are slightly convex/rounded. Not that it matters. I don't notice any difference. As far as the complaint that the keys are soft to the touch, I don't have a problem with it and again can't tell any difference from other keyboards I've used. So far, I like it, I can type just as fast and accurate as ever and it works. Made by Logitech, so you know it can't be a complete piece of junk."
5,Great value,"Great keyboard for the price. This is a good value for the price, perfect as an add-on for a laptop."
5,Great Keyboard for the Price,"This keyboard is a great deal for the price.The build is very sturdy. It's a simple keyboard with no multimedia functions, but it is good for everyday use."
4,good,nice inexpensive external keyboard for my laptop to type out all those long reports without straining my wrist. worth it if you do a lot of typing.
4,keyboard,"It works. A key or two sticks occasionally. Nice and simple. No extra key, that I never need or use."
5,Great for what it is,"It's a great basic keyboard. I had my previous Logitech for around 6-7 years and the spacebar was beginning to stick. It had a few media keys which I never used so I figured this would be a nice ""upgrade"".All in all the keys have a nice feel. The first thing I checked when I got it was to see if the keys ""stuck"" if they were pressed at a slight angle. Cheaper keyboards tend to be like this, but this one doesn't suffer such a cheap feel. Keys easy to press with good feedback. Not too stiff, not too soft. The keyboard sits very flat on the desk with no wobble or anything. It's relativity quiet... Yeah, just rambling about the stuff that SHOULD be common among all keyboards, eh?If you just need a basic USB keyboard, you can't go wrong with this one."
3,My Shift is Stuck.,"I loved the price of this keyboard. Add to the fact, that it's from Logitech, a name that I recognize, and I was full on board! The keyboard is not so noisy, however it's not that quiet, either. The only real issue that I have with this keyboard is, from time to time, the Shift key gets stuck (what a metaphor for my life right now). I guess you get what you pay for. All in all, it's not bad. It gets the job done! It you expect perfection, don't buy this keyboard. But if you are content with getting the job done efficient- and effectively, BUY THIS!"
1,Not all the keys worked,"Received this keyboard and plugged it in. Found that some of the keys didn't work, mostly the ones surrounding the letter ""L"". Expected better from Logitech, since I'm happy with their other products."
5,Americans--each one!,"It appears to me that the words of wisdom Carolyn shares in this book as an action call to Americans, is also and maybe even more importantly a reminder and demand to each individual to heal his/her own private world, and that one by one we can, with God's help and guarantee, heal our neighborhood, town, city, state, country and world. Thought-provoking, and written with the obvious passion of her faith journey."
5,Very nice watch!,"I am a fitness professional and have looked around for an inexpensive, nice sports watch for some time. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I wear my watch everyday and it takes quite a beating on some days but still holds up nicely. I highly recommend!"
5,"Super handy, all the right info","Very comfortable... fits my wrist perfectly and doesn't get in the way when I'm swimming laps.Backlight button very handy when my eyes are a little foggy after being in the water for a while.Buttons are fairly intuitive, but I still had to read the directions a couple of times.Overall, this is an awesome sports watch for the money!"
2,Broken,I received this and went to use it and all seemed fine. Then when I went to let the air out no water came out. The adapter cap is broken and will not let any water through. I emailed the company and they told me to call. So I called and they always say they are closed even though I call within their business hours. I'm very unhappy because I would like to use this now I have wasted my money because I will have to buy a different brand.
1,Woopie Cushion,Not a good product its to hard to screw top on and some attachments don't fit properly.
1,poor quality,"Poor quality, tube does not stay connected during use. They slip off, which of course causes water to spurt out all over the place and make a mess."
1,"Cheap construction, and short hose","Don't waste your money. The construction is cheap. For example, the clip to shut off the water flow stopped working after only the third use. Also, the hose is VERY short. The shortest I've ever encountered with this kind of product."
1,Trash,The rubber cord is so cheaply made it impedes the flow of water. A waste of money. This product doesn't work well at all. Try another brand.
2,Gets you by. Will want better.,"Seller was great, but product wasn't so much. White plastic hose folds too easy. Leaks at Hose connections. Holes in nozzle were not formed properly in molding process, preventing water from flowing. Hole in bag for hook is weak, when it breaks, kit is unusable. Hose stains easy, but bleach takes care of that. Found same kit at Walmart for 5.00. Worth ordering from here for privacy. Otherwise smooth transaction with seller."
3,Exactly as expected,"Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the product description - no more no less.The only thing I endeavor to add, as I feel it is missing from the reviews of many enema products, is that it does not accommodate large custom nozzles. This is not a downside at all, merely an observation for those who pursue enemas for the purposes of recreation as well as for health benefits.Other than that, it's exactly as it appears - no more, no less."
3,Cannot use hot water,"This bag works well for enemas if you have a place to hang it at towel bar height.Water Bottle-I have used hot water with it,around 120 degrees and the plastic around the opening of the bag separates resulting in a leaky bag rendering it Useless. I find this disappointing, because when using lower temperatures for warm water bottle applications it does not get very warm to the surface touch and gets cold fast."
3,It's a waterbag or is it?,This product works well as a water bag. It does have a chemical smell to it and it probably is the material itself. Haven't had it for very long but wonder if the smell will dissipate over time. This might be a concern for those who intend to fill it with a liquid that will be inserted into their bodies. Since it is marketed as a douche and enema bag I'm hoping that the smell of the product isn't nothing to worry about.
4,nice bottle,It was everything I needed....it's too bad that there wasn't more nozzles included.It arrived quickly-no complaints here!
1,Garbage Dont Buy,"Absolute junk. The tube isnt even a real tube its plastic that will stretch so far it comes off the base. Even with a zip tie to hold the tube in place I still needed to replace the entire tube with one I bought from the store. The attachment that cuts off the water flow does nothing and the hanging clip isnt strong enough to hold its weight.The water bottle is decent but it wont do you any good without the rest of the materials.Enough said, stay away and spend the extra money for something that isnt plastic junk."
1,very bad,"hose comes out of bag when in use. poor clip design and quality, hose doesn't hold its shape, parts of it stay so flat that water flow is impeded."
3,soso,The bottle is fine but all the attachment are cheap and the cord is way short which is not very practical to attached for use.
4,Must Have,"She needed, or wanted, a replacement for a wore out unit. This one is pretty good at filling her cleansing needs."
1,"Douche, Enema Kit Joke",The hose is thin and flimsey and the bag leeks. This was a waist fo my money.
4,Double trouble,"I loved this bag for both enemas and douches. My question is, why don't they include the attachment that comes with any bag you buy in italy or France? The double prong does an enema and a douche in one sitting. A waterfall of fun. Oddly enough, my front takes just as much water as my rear about 2 quarts. I guess I'm a ""gallon girl!"""
1,"Company doesn't stand behind it, despite claiming on the box it has a lifetime warranty.","I unfortunately had this over a month before opening the kit. What I discovered is that I had two clamps instead of one and no adapter piece for the hose which makes this completely useless. The companies toll free number is on the box so I called them and they said sorry, we don't have spare parts, see if where you bought it from will return it.Returning a 10 dollar item for one plastic part they should be able to send me is a waste. I may as well buy another kit.It won't be one made by this company."
1,Can't hold water,"Bought 2. This product can't hold water! The hose and clips cannot withstand water pressure, even when only 1/4 capacity.It may look like the product ordered, but it can't perform the functions for which intended. Tried the 2nd one; same results. Ugh!"
4,WaterBottle,"The product was well packaged & arrived in a timely manner. It is a very good product, however the actual bottle itself could be a hair larger as it is a bit smaller than water bottles I have purchased at the pharmacy.Overall, it is a good value for ordering on line & not having to hunt one down in the stores! Satisfied customer."
1,Cheap,"This item was purchased for it's price and we got what we paid for, the interior ring is made of metal which is rusting. The tubing is flimsy and of poor quality plastic. I would not recomend this brand, I would pay $20.00 at walgreens for a much better quality one that has the same items as this but of far superior quality."
1,Do not waste your time,You can't imagine how low can be quality...Try to find something more expensive (at least twice like I did) and enjoy!
2,Poor nozzle screw,At first everything was fine. But after a few uses the screw in nozzles started to leek. It makes a big mess in a way you don't want it to. The hose is also stiff and doesn't flow well.The bag portion and the hook are nice. The clamp works fine.
2,Leaks from cheap hose/not such a great deal.,"This is a pretty simple straight forward product so not a lot can go wrong, but apparently the hose that attaches to the bag is cheaply made and it's not very old and has not been used a lot. The hose leaks because it stretches every time you take it off and put it back on. Flimsy grade plastic. Not such a great deal anymore. If you only need this bag to use once or twice I'd say it's fine for that but that's about it."
1,CRAPPY and useless.,I bought this product to help improve my health only to end up with something totally useless unless you count the water bag by itself. The cap seems to be the wrong size and fit for the hot water bag and easily fall outs every time I try to use it.
1,bad product,"The price was more from them for shipping that it woul have been to run down to th pharmany and just buy one outright. None of the attachements fit the bottle. whn I read the warrenty information, I read that I have to spend more for shipping than the product is worth. The people will notanswer the phone or call you back in atimely manner. I was wondering if I can cancel this tansaction and return the unusable pece of junk without having to pay them anymore cash.The only stopper that fit the bottle was the main plug. Evrythng else was up tp .100 thousanths out on the size and will not fit anything.."
5,Works great,"No complaints, it works perfectly Everytime. I lost my old one so I actually need to buy another which I will."
1,Cheap.,Cheap item. You get what you pay for. the hose doesn't fit tight on the bottle or attachments. Made a big mess
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!The enema bag was used!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first one I bought was new, this one had some old parts and some used parts."
2,Minor faults should have been caught,"Connection at bag leaks. Also, a small black gasket on the screw-on connector to the tubing easily falls off, again and again. Why weren't these problems corrected before selling to the public?"
2,pipe is too short.,"price is good compared to what I bought in the past bu had to throw it away .. unusable, tube is too short."
5,Best Buy,"While writing ""Anal Sex for Couples: A Guaranteed Guide to Painless Pleasure,"" Lori and I tested all these bags. While better bags are available, this one gives you the best product for the lowest price. The kit contains everything you need for a cleansing enema or an erotic mind-expanding adventure. Good quality, good price, good fun. Enjoy!"
5,Loved it!,"I picked up this product for a ""Friend"" and my ""Friend"" said he never had such a great experience with a product. It is for the money the best deal out there for when you need to snake the drain so my ""Friend"" says."
1,I Never Got It,"I would love to give a review of the Hot Water Bottle by Get Organized that I ordered, but I never received it. Instead, I received an Enema Syringe by California Exotic Novelties, with a return address listed as:DAB Nutrition3225 N. Arizona Ave. STE 5Chandler, AZ 85225There was no phone number given nor any instruction as to what to do in the event of an error or damage in shipping.I tried to email DAB directly to explain what happened and received two different responses, one stating that they were no longer able to ship ""the Caress Mosturizing Body Bars"".I'm confused. But I know I'm not alone."
5,great,i have used this product for 3 months now and love it. my girlfriend liike to use it on me to punish me during sex and she loves her vagina with water in it
5,I LEARNED A LOT FROM READING THIS BOOK.,"This book really taught me a lot, especially about concealment(the most important factor in getting a goose). It also told me about decoys and decoy placements, calling and when not to call, stratagies, when to hunt and where to hunt, equipment and receipes."
1,overpriced,"the 'device' is just a piece of rope. Nothing special about it. It's tied in a knot at each end, and if you order this you'll find it's vastly overpriced."
1,Just another annoying episode of a pointless series,"How did ""Simpsons"" ever make it big in the fisrt place?Yuck!The animation is godawful,there are no plots,and noneof the stories are even the least bit funny.If you find littleboys getting hit by cars are people getting poisoned by fishfunny,then you've got a serious problem.Don't waste yourmoney on any ""Simpsons""garbage,and get a decently funnyseries like""Laurel and Hardy"" or ""Loony Toons""."
4,Teenager warning: may annoy parents,"With forty cuts on the album, an ungrade from the much earlier vynal release, b TEEN COMEDY PARTY manages to crack laughs out of most of them. From an interview with a drug addled and recovering Alvin the chipmunk, in a ""where are they now?"" segment to a loopy ""At the Record Store"" segment, manage to stay consistantly funny. The album could be called ""punk Monty Python"" for its sheer brashness. Some of the segments are dated, but the humor is not, to wit: ""The Earth Mother News"" a folksy number on a ""build it yourself nuclear reactor."" It would be a good listen in an overly long car drive; some of the material is about radio. A good album. I finished it wishing for more."
4,"beautiful movie !!!,","his is one of the smoothest, coolest and most beautiful movie ever produced in bollywood. a very cool movie starring jeetu, rena roy and rameshwari. the plot, the scriptwriting, the characters were well portrayed. j. om prakash is a master in love story.The songs are very stimulating. the song 'ashaon ke sawan me' is a masterpiece. jeetu and rena looked extremely radiant and classic. jeetu is ever good in love songs. he is extremely gifted, and directors who understand how to exploit this gift and ability in jeetu enjoy the comfort that he radiates in doing love scenes. he is really a blessing to Hindi filmworld.Aasha is a film to watch any day !!!"
5,Great Ex-pen with door,"I use this to crate my great dane and save hundreds not buying a crate. With my biggest dane I have to anchor this to the wall to keep him from knocking it over (but he is 200lbs of puppy) but worth it no having to invest 250+ in a crate he'll be squished in. My other danes don't bother knocking it over. Great size, great quality!"
2,Very Disapointed!,"Typically I find Regina Scott to be a wonderful writer, however I was very disappointed with Starstruck. There was no mystery involved- it was obvious who was the ""bad guy"", and although it is rarely a mystery whether or not the hero and heroine will get together, in Starstruck the romance was particularly bland. Certain characters seemed to lose their edge, certain sub-plots petered out in the middle-all in all not what I expected from Regina Scott. However, some props for the astronomy research, however I did find mistakes in the french!! My advice? go for the Unflappable Miss Fairchild-this is the first one that I read and it certainly was good enough to keep me coming back for more...and I'm rarely dissapointed (this book being the exception!)"
4,Good value,"Good value for the money. Everything you need. Too bad the towel isn't microfiber. Nowadays, microfiber towels aren't that expensive."
2,Not impressed....,Bought as a gift. Received everything stated in product description but the liquid products in this kit were dried up and useable. It also made the entire bag smell of spilled alcohol.
3,Good enough,"This accessory kit was okay. My sister only used a few items in the kit. The rosen bag and the carrying case were the best parts of the kit. If you need only a few items, best to buy seperate."
4,"Easy, tasty, and healthy.","Let's face it, freeze-dried eggs are never at the top of anyone's must-eat list, but when you're camping (or, heaven forbid, relying on them for an emergency), you won't do much better than this for the price. I'm not exactly a fan of FDEs, thanks to a number of substandard school cafeterias, but the inclusion of ham and peppers actually transformed a usually bland staple into a very nutritious and satisfying meal. Preparation is easy -- just add boiling water, reseal, and wait a couple of minutes -- and the high nutritive value is right there on the package. (Flavor hint: add some dry parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes to the mix before eating.)Hey, I'd love to bring fresh eggs with me on the trail, but this way I don't have to carry them (AND a pan). I just heat 'em up and eat 'em from the bag. No hassle, no cleanup. I'd give it five stars, but hey, they're still freeze-dried eggs."
3,tastless,This survivor trail food is tastless. The eggs are easy to chew and abundent. The meat is not so abundent. Im still looking for the peppers. A rip off at the price advertised. Try eating your shoeleather instead. Ugh.
4,Mountain House meal,Meal was pretty good. Eggs tasted fine. I recommend letting the boiling water sit 8-10 minutes in the bag vice 5-6 minutes that it says on the package....that way the ham would be more tender and eggs would re-constitute completely.
2,bad taste and smell,Most Mountain House meals are good. This one is not. It tastes like a wet dish sponge cooked in a campfire. The smoke flavor is horrible. Choose another entree.
3,Pretty Tasty,"Does not tast that bad actually pretty good, I recommend that you use a little hot sauce. Could not be easier to make,"
2,Barely Palatable,"This product was still crunchy in some areas and rather poor in taste. I would suggest have your water at the boiling point to possibly improve the ability to absorb water. After a lengthy period of time, not everything absorbed the water. I spent my cold morning looking for something else to eat. As for the taste, I expected something a bit more flavorful. I'd rather make my own dehydrated food items."
5,"Age of mythology, the great RPG of 2002-2003",IF you like the fantasy of great fighters and old mythology with men and different creaters? then you will love this game. THis is a very fun RPG that is very lengthly and fun in the process. IF i were you i would be go buy this game right now because its so awesome! so go and have a great time playing it
2,Age of Mythology,"This is the worst of the AOE games, in my opinion. In fact, I refuse to play it with my boyfriend (which is why any girl would play any of the AOE games). ;-) But I actually have fun playing AOE II. This one is horrible; cheesy!!!"
1,"Toner only, no probe ....","I was researching test gear and came across this page .... Beware that this ad is very deceiving ..... The picture shows the kit, but the model number (and what you will ultimately receive) is the toner unit only ..... I would not trust any ads from this company ...... Great product .... Bad advertising practice by this reseller ....Edit: 16 March 2012 .... Looks like this vendor has finally changed out the item picture ..... It is less deceiving than when I posted my original review, although the price they are charging for this is no 'deal' .... And can be had cheaper elsewhere .... I'd like to think that my review saved someone from getting stung by this vendor .... One of the best things about shopping on Amazon is Reader Reviews ...... :-) ....."
2,"good idea, should be able to work from year to year","My only real complaint about publisher is that you cannot use it from one production year to the next. Because of this, I've gone to using Adobe Illustrator for all my publishing needs. I simply cannot understand why Microsoft insists on limiting the year-to-year versatility of Publisher. I have multiple documents I've created over the years but I cannot access them on my work pc because it has a newer version. For all their ingenuity, this is repeatedly and extremely disappointing.UPDATE: Obviously Microsoft has worked out a few kinks. Publisher is a great resource for common and weekly business applications, but for the amateur designer attempting to create an advertisement, this program lags behind Illustrator. Great for sinc with other programs, uninteresting for creative license."
3,Not excellent but good enough,"I was pleasently suprised to find Microsoft had not jerked with the menu displays and options(like they did with Word), and so this version is almost the same as Publisher 2003 in form and function. I know their are better publishing programs avaliable, but this one is fine for the basics and because of the price."
4,It works for me.,"I purchased this software after using Publisher in the mid nineties, because I needed to create and maintain a website for my new business. I am a farmer, so I have no extra time to fiddle around learning some software or open source products. I needed a webpage fast that had all the basics, and my outdated knowledge of Publisher (along with its great help guides and wizards) made that a reality within a few hours. Now the members of my CSA can see what is going on here at the farm any time. Cool stuff!"
4,Publisher 2007,I bought this as a replacement for the 2000 Microsoft Home Publisher since I just bought a new CPU with Vista and the old MHP was not compatible with Vista. It seems to work well although it has many features I still haven't figured out and will probably never use. It seems to be more complicated and redundant than necessary but does do the job of creating notecards and Christmas cards from my paintings. It will take more time to learn some of the intricate features but overall I am well satisfied to date.
4,Microsoft Publisher 2007,I had used this at my work place and got to the point that I needed it on my computer. Works well and I like it.
5,Great product and easy to use.,"I purchased this for my business, it is great! Also, it is very easy to use."
1,"There is No Manual, Hey you can figure it out","I've owned several versions of publisher over the years. It has always been my favorite program for desktop publishing. I haven't had a need for it for 8 years. Now several computers and versions of Publisher later I have a need to use it again.I opened the box, no manual. I looked on the CD no manual, I've searched for several days and I can find no reference anywhere to a manual for this product.I buy a lot of software and have for many years, this is the first product I've ever bought that does not have a manual.I don't have time to sit and just click on things and try and figure it out. I find it hard to believe so many people just want a product that has no manual. They just start clicking away.It is very hard to review a product that provides no instruction on even how to set up the most elementary of documents let alone how to create a postcard and send it to an email group.Does anyone know where to get a manual from Microsoft on Publisher 2007?"
5,Very Helpful,This product is very helpful for me. I'm doing a newsletter for the very first time and don't really know how to do one. The templates on here and are great and easy to use. It's helping me layout my newsletter the way I want to. I'm a little electronically inept so some things are a little difficult for me to figure out. But I click here and there and find my way through to get the desired result I want.
5,Very Useful,"Great value for the money, lots of capabilities, I highly suggest it. I've been using MS Publisher since 2003 and love it."
4,Great Pricing - Great Product,I was going to buy off the shelf at a major retailer but they did not have this available. Glad I didn't. Got this for a better price on line. I WAS hoping for an upgraded version. I have 2003 at work. And I really don't see any difference. But I wanted one for my own computer to help me create business fliers and post cards.
3,Very User Unfriendly!,"This is not the wonderful ""Publisher"" that I loved and adored and made a living from as a graphics designer for years. However, my family went through the Katrina Hurrican here in Biloxi, and lost everything and I have been away from a computer for the past three years. I can't believe how frustrating it has become to create a simple document inserting graphics.""If it ain't broken, don't fix it""."
3,Microsoft Publisher 2007,Microsoft Publisher 2007Does most of what I want it to do but does'nt do them well. The ability to fit items on a page at the same distance from top of page is not easy to do!
2,Stand alone software?,"Can someone please tell me if this version of Publisher for Windows 7 can stand alone, or do I need to have the Office Suite?Thank you!"
5,Microsoft Publisher 2007,"I received this item in a very timely manner, and it was everything I expected it to be."
2,Microsoft Publisher 2007,"Like most Microsoft programs, this is a big disappointment; even loading it is a problem. To load, it is necessary to have a ""product key"". This ""key"" is supposed to be located on the package, but was nowhere to be found. The licensing agreement needs the help of an attorney to interpret; I'm sure most users blindly click their agreement. For almost $200 I would have thought I might receive more. I'd go on, but I think my computer is about to crash."
3,Disappointed with Publisher 2007,"The naviagation tools are difficult to follow. They do not allow for easy access to items that you want to use. The inability to re-load the program has caused a problem for my office. I had to re-load my Windows-XP and could not re-load Publisher 2007 on the same computer. Bummer. $153.00 down the drain. I would not recommend the 2007 version of Publisher to others, it is not user friendly,"
4,MS Publisher,The 2007 version was just fine. It's closer to what I'm use to than the newer versions.I use it primarily for Newsletters. I use to use MS WORD but Publisher is better becauseit's more powerful.
1,Amazon.com,"The purchase was a gift for a lady who creates flyers, brochures and documents for a group. When it was opened, she said that MS Word performed all of the functions that she needed and did not want the additional software. It was never opened and it was returned for credit.I would rate Amazon.com as a 5 star company to do business with. The original purchase, the return and the refund was handled very smoothly and we (my wife does most of the shopping) will continue to make a wide variety of purchases through Amazon.com."
5,Just as described,"MS Publisher for Office 2007. Arrived when promised. Easy to install, just run setup and enter the Serial Number/Activation Code. Recommended!"
5,Much Better Than I Was Led to Believe,"This version of Microsoft Publisher is ""by far"" the best of all the publisher programs I have purchased in the past. It beats other name brands hands down, and it is greatly improved over the MS`Publisher I bought in 2000."
5,No doubt a GREAT book! One of my best!,"Make no mistake here. Total Design is certaingly one of the best books EVER on the subject of product development and engineering design. It is applicable both to students learning engineering design, as well to professionals trying to fix up their PD practice by means of trying to structure the way they develop new and improved product. Get it! Read it! USE IT! You will never regret!"
2,WARNING!!!,"Becareful of the word ""portable"". I purchased this so i could have my music and movies on my hardrive from my desktop computer. After putting all my stuff on it, i plugged it into my laptop (2gb ram 100gb hardrive 15"" powerbook g4) and it would not show up. I talked to customer service reps at Iomega (kinda not helpful at all) and they said that the USB port did not give out enough power and that i had to purchase an AC adapter....last time i checked airplanes did NOT have plugs...bottom line this peice of junk now serves no purpose to me...i might as well use my 120gb external...dont waste your money if your planning on using a laptop"
5,excellent value for the price,"i got these bits for my bosch ps30, and it works fine. i don't recommend drilling concrete, but for your basic household needs, these bits should fulfill all your drilling needs. lots of different, useful types in this little box, including those weird hex ones. i don't know how strong these are, but for the price, i don't think you can get such variety of types and sizes as this set."
5,Great book for kids going on auditions,I bought this book for my daughter to practice with to improve her acting skills when she goes on auditions. We have loved it and would enjoy it even if her goal wasn't to be an actor.
1,worse than the xmas album,this us not another disco disc. it has the same empire song with about 2 seconds added to the end.bad bad bad yukky ikimagin the xmas album without the 1 halfway desent song. thats this.
4,Makes a very nice cake,"This is my first cake that I have made gluten free, I tried the brownie mix by Betty Crocker and that is to die for.This is a very nice, moist not too sweet chocolate cake it gives a nice little crispy edge which I love. The only issue is that they say decadent, I do not agree with that, the chocolate is a bit light, it could use a stronger chocolate flavor. It is just a plain, albeit very good, chocolate cake. With that said I would definitely buy this again, it hits the spot on most levels."
1,CD missing,"this item was advertised with a CD, the CD did not come with the book. i am a little disappointed about that"
3,Incomplete shipment,I did not receive the audio DVD.I understand that it is free but that was the reason why I bougth this item. I tried to contact Amazon immediately but you don't have a link for this cases. THe only way is follow the process to return the item but is more expensive for me to return the book.If you can not solve this I appreciate that delete my information from your database because I'm not going to buy anything in your site.
2,Not Very Useful,"This book is the pits. The text is in two columns on each page and has an extemely annoying numbering system that just gets in the way and screws up your concentration, and gives it a cult/bible look and feel. They say two columns on each page was ""TESTED"" but I think the persons evaluating it said it was ""COOL"" just because it is different, not better. After reading it a while you'd swear you were playing a video game from the constant eye motion, 4x more than normal. The worst thing about this Uversa text is the lame picture of Christ on the cover. In the 19th century it was a good painting but today anyone would think Christ is presented as looking kind of odd. I am no fan of the competion, The Urantia Foundation, but their book is better for practical reading and can live with their well known editing ""woes""."
5,A Textbook for living,"The Urantia Book changed my life. The truths and philosophical principals in this book are literally a textbook for living life. The works on the life of Jesus showed me a relationship with a loving Father I never knew existed. The index in the back of this particular printing is valuable in that you have the tools in one book. A lot of work went into this effort.If you are looking for truth, read this book."
3,Book of Urantia,"Have not read the entire book but read the section on the life of Jesus Christ. It gives a lot of detail about the ""missing years"" and his siblings which is very interesting and informative. I do not understand where all this information originated but so far have not read anything that is in direct conflict with the Bible. I plan to read the entire book in the near future."
3,The Urantia Book ( indexed Version ),"This book is packed with lots of information on God our Father and the universe, the planets etc. However it's Doctrine is totally different from what i am taught. Myself being a Catholic-Spiritualist, i believe in prayers for the Dead, Praying to the Saints for intervention, and also my Spiritualist side believes in speaking to the Dead. According to this book it is impossible to speak to the dead, as the Spirits of the Dead do not return anymore, and cannot commununicate with us because they are in an unconscious sleep. It sort of puts a bummer on me speaking to my Mom and my Dad and ever meeting them again in the after-life. Also it speaks about Michael as one of the sons of God ???? Not something i was taught. So i was sort of dissappointed in it's Accuracy on Doctrine."
1,No free audio book on dvd,Urantia book was to inclued a free audio book dvd. The wraping for the dvd was in the box but the dvd had been removed. The dvd was the main reason I ordered the book.
3,big trouble,"the lock is fine but when i try to install it, it doesnt fit the ""standard"" holes that were initially drill on my door. Could be my fault for that or the way this product was made. I had to drill bigger holes for this lock to fit on my door."
2,Wrong key wrong lock,Installs great fit's normal door holes from home depot. My beef is that i put the wrong key in the door and i was able to unlock it. The key does not have anything in common with the key it came with. Not a secure solution!
5,Great Quality / Perfect Fit,I was a little skeptical of this product. It arrived and was great. Just the right size for a snug fit for my Harbor Freight 500 Lb. Capacity Aluminum Cargo Carrier Item #92655. I would recommend this unit and this company for their product.
1,Digital Clock Can't Display Time,"I purchased seven of these clocks to be used for machine production purposes. After one week, four of the seven clocks either lost part of the display or the entire display. Disappointing product."
4,Intriguing.,"This is an intriguing compilation that focuses on little-known album tracks that were never released as singles. Only ""Aqui Conmigo"" and ""Deja La Luz Encendida"" charted- the others were culled from Paquito's first three TH-Rodven albums."
3,SQUEAKY,SEEM TO PRODUCE A LOT OF FINGER SQUEAK WHEN MOVING UP AND DOWN THE FRETBOARD. ELIXIR POLYWEBS MUCH BETTER -HAD THEM ON FOR 3MOS WITH NEARLY DAILY PLAYING. GOING BACK TO THE ELIXIRS
2,Second Rate,"It was suggested that I try the Cleartone strings, but having used Elixr PB for a while now, these strings fall short of my expectations. They are not as bright as Elixr and seem to have more diffculty staying in tune. Gave them a try but now they're coming off."
5,Start and end your day with this book.,An amazing collection of devotions on simplicity and spirituality. Accompanying each devotional are great prayers from throughout history combined with beautiful photographs of the Shaker community. You'll want to keep this book open and wander through it daily.
5,Haunting and unforgettable,"One of Rahman's best from back in the day when he was still original and it didn't feel as if he was trying too hard. The lyrics are beautiful even to the ears of someone like me who doesn't understand the language, and the music itself is haunting and completely brings out the emotions of the movie. If you like the music but haven't seen the movie, I would suggest you do."
3,Case was cracked,"The case arrived cracked in 1 place. It was a gift for someone, so I explained it could be returned.My friend opened it, and the CD was fine, so we kept it."
1,"No real content, just links","I was very disappointed in this book. Based on the description and other reviews, I was expecting a simple introduction to Flash and DHTML. Instead this book is just a list of about 40 websites and a screen print from each of them. This whole book could be summed up with a list of website bookmarks in an email attachment."
2,I've never go to N. Arkansas Again!,"If you are expecting a Hollywood style movie this one is not for you. If you would like to see a better than average high school video project then this is a good movie. A mix of documentary, native american history, myth, and fiction all rolled into a movie that attempts to combine drama, horror, and comedy all into one. The premise of the movie was not tied into the modern setting very well. It took most of the movie to figure out how the opening scene tied in with the main movie. Jon Paul Gates character had issues but these were not developed and you weren't sure what they were until the movie was nearly over. Had we known what he was doing and why the movie would be greatly improved.The biggest disappointment in the movie is that the final outcome of the mysterious bad guy is not shown. Did he get away with it????Don't buy this movie. Get someone you know to buy this movie and then borrow it from them."
1,please dont waste your money sucks big time,i love bigfoot movies. but this one i would never waste my time or money on had i known. so im warning you i wouldnt spend a cent on it..... and thats the truth.. NO BLOOD FOREST..
4,Exciting and Creative,"I read where this is Bill Barton's first movie, and I think he did a great job to begin his movie making career. He's very creative and is not afraid to try new ideas. You can tell he wants to entertain us with everything he does. This movie is on the style of the Blair Witch movie, but definitly a step up from that. Hope to see more of his works soon. This movie was very suspenseful and kept me entertained throughtout the movie with different tactics to help you see bigfoot in a serious side and a funny side. Loved it from start to finish. A lot of suspense, but not too much blood and gore. Jan the fan."
3,Level+ for RV's,This little level works as well as most. Though it is fairly large to be mounted on the outside of an RV I think. To take care of this problem I mounted it on the inside of my LP gas bottle door. Not only is it out of the way it is protected from the elements. It remains easy to use as I only have to open the door when raising or lowering the 5th wheel to see the level.
5,I drooled a bit,"I mainly liked this book alot because one, I love 70's cars, and two: many good pictures of the cars. Other than that, some nifty snippits of information about each year, and each picture shown. Die harders might find it to be short on displaying all the cars of each year, but I think it hits pretty good on the major ones."
5,Delicious,Small cubicle potatoes in thick creamy sort of sauce with pieces of beef in it. The flavor is completely delicious! The only complaint i could possibly have is that the potatoes don't quite cook all the way. I still found this to be wonderful and will buy it again.
1,Half as long would have been plenty,"I struggled through the interminable descriptions of stench, of fountains bubbling in the background, of statues, wrought iron gates, you name it, Lindsey can write two paragraphs on it.After 80 pages, I started skipping the paragraphs that were desciptive filler. I gave up by chapter 17.If ever there were a book that would make me believe the author was being paid by the word, it would be this one. Had some of those words actually created a spark of interest in the characters, I might have pressed on.Perhaps Lindsey has written better books. Too bad this was my first encounter with his writing. It will be my last."
2,Too much information,"Wordy, wordy, wordy. Too many descriptions of plants, gates, buildings, smell, fog.That being said, it opened my eyes to the incredible harm our agencies (CIA, etc,) have done in many parts of the world. Kill the poor farmers to keep them from becoming communists."
1,Vanity press at its absolute worst,"I don't know what book everyone else is reading-I found the poor paper quality to be the best aspect of this book.The poetry is trite, boring, and quite simply, lame. Each poem is as intelligent and affecting as the lyrics of a glam/hair band. Need an example? ""Toward the water the lily flew upon a wind of change."" Isn't that a lyric from the Scorpions, that balding German rock band from the 80's?""Ethereal splendor""? Able to ""break through the norm""? Every page is the epitome of the norm-bland, average, predictable, whiny, childish-high school level at best. Having friends write reviews won't make the writing any better."
4,Does what is does,"The one I got was white, not red as pictured. Like I said, does what it is supposed to. Only complaint could be that the white gets dirty faster."
1,Not as good as it looks,"I rather buying any other kind of polisher, not a carrier because it is hard to polish the ball when it is inside.I had to take the ball in my hand, and then use the polisher not as it shows in the picture."
2,see-saw bowling polisher,"Well its nice dont get me wrong, but the handles are not as big as you see! but does the job, i just needed longer handles."
5,Ball Polisher,"This sling works well, makes it very easy to carry the bowling ball, and seems sturdy to hold up for years!"
5,Magnificent! The very essence of Roman Law!,"This collection is the epitome of Roman (Civil) Law. The basic principles, institutions, proceedings and controversies of the Civil Law Tradition are contained in this marvelous creation by Justinian. A must-have for any serious lawyer."
3,"Catchy title, but disappointing","This book was a major disappointment. Despite several interesting vignettes, the book reads more like a textbook than a book about the Amish.The author is a Geauga County (Ohio) agriculture official and goes into great detail about planting seeds; plowing; farming methods; startup costs; and, profits. You hardly get anything on the Amish themselves. However, he does tell you what they served him for dinner when he helped out around their farms. Rivetting stuff!If you're looking for something about Amish life, this isn't the book for you. But, if you're interested in farming, you may find this book helpful.By the way, the author never does tell you why cows learn Dutch."
4,When Gay was hard to be...,"...and drugs were good for you. Or at least socially acceptable.This is an irreverent romp through one segment of gay culture - the Butch, or garden-variety ""Macho Man"", circa 1980.If you're not gay, this book will make no sense to you. If you are under 35, you won't get it at all. You will wonder why any of this is considered funny.If you are over 35, gay, and ever aspired to being ""butch"", it's hysterical. Oddly enough, straight women find it funny, but for different reasons, and they still don't understand it.When first published, it was a lampoon of gay male social behavior. Now, it's nostalgic trip to an era when ""the clap"" was the most dreaded STD, drugs were good for you, and all you needed to have a great sex life was good pecs, mirrored sunglasses, and poppers.If you didn't understant that last sentence, don't bother with this book. If it made you at least smile, get this book."
5,Charming the Listeners - I Never Get Bored of This CD,"Bryan Kelley's refreshing, enlivening and consoling music on this CD is a cathartic ""coming of age"" journey in my mind. ""I Lie In the Water"" makes us feel our burdened yet liberating freedom of choice and aloneness in a world of so many possibilities and inevitable wrong turns. ""Where Are They Now"" also takes us back to our wanderings in and out of each other's lives. I see his collection of songs as a reflection of our determined, sad, angry and joyful desire to be our unique and flawed selves while trying to build and belong to an ideal paradise of happy and healthy lovers, friends, and family. I thank him for a successful work that describes this eternal conflict. (He also makes his live performances seem like a warm and casual circle of friends enjoying good music and grooves together. I saw him and his great band at The Mint in Los Angeles on Pico Boulevard.)"
5,Great vitamins...,My teen love these vitamins! It gives him energy! also the price is very affordable! I always buy these vitamins.
5,The Grestest Videos of the Greatest Band,"Do you care a lot? I know I do. This video is a very entertaining way to spend 120 minutes. Begining with Midlife Crisis, and ending with a bonus live video of ""This Guy's In Love With You"", excitment flows through the body. I have to say that some of the behind the scenes video is a little odd but... look what artists this video is for! Jim Martain bungee jumping is very funny. ""I Started a Joke"" is extremly, I mean extreamly impresive, considering that the bad never appears in it. All FNM fans should have this video, casual or die-hard. Faith No More in the words of Brett ""Hitman"" Hart is the best there was, the best there is, and the best there ever will be."
5,where is the ricochet film clip???,"i have this in my collection and its the most watched out of all my vids. the only thing that disapoints me is that they left out the video of ""ricochet"" from the king for a day album... its one of my favourite songs and has an unreal film clip too... other than that, this is absolutely the best buy for any music fan. its worth having in your collection. wen are they going to release a ""Mr bungle"" video or dvd?? i'll keep my fingers crossed."
3,From back cover:,"When Bolivia Smith went in search of a story in the jungle outside Miami, she never expected to discover soldiers in training for a real war. She was even less prepared to find herself taken prisoner by a red-haired, red-bearded giant who went by the unlikely name of Tooley.For Tooley, not only did Bolivia's presence threaten all his plans, he was in danger of becoming the kind of man who'd chuck everything he believed in just for the sake of love."
1,Not Good,"Anyone who rates this a 5 must work for microsoft. The wireless card is ok, but the router is absolutley worthless. I never could get the installation software to work with my windows 98 operating system. I had to configure it manually. Then the router would have to be reset 2 to 3 time a day. So when I tried to upload a software update sent by microsoft online, the router stopped working and would not even reset. I had mine for over 90 days, so when I asked microsoft for help, they wanted a service fee. So much for microsoft products. I went out and bought a Linksys router. It installed in 5 minutes. I threw the microsoft router away. I sleep better at night now."
5,"Great Price, Great Gadget","Here in Pakistan, technology is just coming up. Networking is common but wireless networking is just round the corner. Brand new D-Link/Linksys equipment is available but quite expensive. An Access Point/Router with a laptop PCMCIA card (802.11b) costs about $160 here. So purchasing this Microsoft kit for only $39.88 was peanuts. Setting it up was a breeze! And in no time I was up and about, surfing the web (broadband connection) on my Acer laptop. I was in a state of ecstasy, roaming in different parts of my home with my laptop and browsing the web. I heard about it but experiencing for the first time myself was a feeling out of this world. NO WIRES OR CABLES but full web access everywhere!!!Nobody believes me that I have made this wonderful purchase for such a good price."
1,Absolutely Disappointed,"I tried to configure this product 4 times and it just didnt work. The icons on my computer said connected to the internet but none of my online applications could connect. Spent tons of paper downloading help from Microsoft's website, yet no luck.The notebook adapter would just not recognise my home wireless network. So, after hours of endless hope i gave the kit back to Best Buy and got a linksys kit instead. It was cheaper and i had my entire network setup in less than 20 minutes. I might be the ony one out there who loves Microsoft products, but this was a major disapointment."
2,"Not a good solution, try D-Link","OK, I had high hopes for this product. I thought, ""Well, it IS Micro$oft, so it should work."" Setup of the router was fairly easy and the istructions were very easy to follow. The problems started almost right away, when I tried going out to some common web sites and noticed LONG delays (163 ms or more, with 25-50% dropped packets). I dropped my old router back in and the delays were much smaller (60 ms with no dropped packets). I confirmed this to several other web sites and could duplicate it, so I called the Micro$oft help desk. This was a very bad experence with a helpdesk person reading from a script. She told me just to reset the router anytime the connection got slow (no kidding!). I packed up the whole kit and replaced it with the D-Link. Had no problems at all."
3,Good price on a hard to find product,"This is recommended in the Eat Right For Your Bloodtype book for type O's. I can't say I feel any advantage over any other other kind of kelp. But it's hard to find locally, so this is a good option."
2,Not Enough Information,"My wife was looking into buying this product, but when I pulled up the information on Amazon's website it did not provide enough information about the product(i.e. how many milligrams) So I had to go to the manufacturers website to find out the information. When you are dealing with supplements, you need information these days. Amazon fell short on this one.And just for everyone's information, these are 580mg"
3,Worked out of the box!,Setup was a breeze. The definition is pretty good but the color contrast isnt the best. I use the product with my MSN messenger to video conference and it does the job fine.
4,Skype Enhancement,"During a visit, a friend from Amsterdam told us about Skype and how we could communicate for free. I found this webcam on Amazon and installed it and downloaded the free version of Skype. The camera/microphone provides a more than adequate picture and the microphone is quite sensitive. All in all an economical, good quality system for the Skype usage. It was fairly easy to install with the enclosed CD after I found that I had to do the installation with my computer on the internet. It would not install satisfactorily if not online. The camera and microphone have allowed many face to face conversations with our overseas friends. I am going to buy one each of these units for our 5 children so we may converse on Skype and see our Grandkids."
3,"Great Audio, mediocre video for this Webcam","I had high hopes for this cheap little webcam. Bought it for my brother who lives in another state for several months so that we could stay in closer touch. The Audio is very good, but the Video is pretty pixelated and at times nearly worthless.It's not bad for what you pay for,but if you have the extra money spend it and get the mid range webcam.I didn't spend a lot, since this is just a temporary fix, but if it were long term I'd spend the extra money."
2,This is only for 32 bit systems,"I have XP Pro 64 bit Windows OS. This cam that I just received today will not operate on a 64 bit system. Error message pops up during software install stating that this is a 32 bit system device. Nowhere in the product description did I see mention that this cam would not work with my OS. Now I just wasted money on this cam and have to look for another one.So beware if you have a 64 bit system as I do, keep looking for another cam."
2,Did not get what I ordered?,The camera I received didn't look as on the picture you give in product information. Design is different. I really do not like when one picture is shown and another thing is sent.
1,"low quality useless - recommend a better version, don't waste your money","horrible quality, low grain pics, can't see much at all, don't waste your money. i bought for grandparents and had to buy 2 new sets of different model with the karl carl weiss lens- much better. skip this"
2,its ok,"it works just fine but it doesn't go well with my laptop/notebookI cannot find a good place to position it, wish I bought one with a micbut it does the job if you dont want to spend a lot of money buy itthe delay isn't bad at all but i had issues with lighting and adjusting it........."
5,Nice little webcam as I was told,"I bought this webcam as a gift for a friend of mine. I haven't actually seen it but he told me that this webcam was cute, small size and fitted his laptop nicely. The low light feature was great that I could still see his face in low light or light off. It was easy to setup and installed. Well, that is what I was told.. Glad I bought this webcam for him!"
4,Great product,"This is my first webcam, it was very easy to install and setup. The only problem I had was that it did not match the picture in any way. It's black, so it works, but I was expecting something a little different."
1,Not the right Item,I ordered this flag becuase I didnt like other ones they had. They ended up shipping me the wrong flag. I also received a flag that was worth less.
2,Watch out for fumes,"The caulk worked well, however... after using I have had a headache ever since (two weeks and counting). The instructions say ""don't breathe vapors"" and provide lots of scary warnings (including cancer and brain damage). But it was hard to avoid while I caulked my gutters for about an hour. I was working on a breezy day so that should have helped minimize my contact with vapors. I did not feel any affects until several hours later. Then, as mentioned, my headache started. I also got a sore throat, and slight congestion. I have never had ill effects from caulks or other chemicals before, so I don't think my reaction the the caulk was exceptional. The next time I caulk my gutters, I'm using polyurethane."
4,A funky and effective blow dryer,"I was intrigued by the funky design of what otherwise is a mundane product, and on the whole it did not disappoint. Be cautioned, however: this is a full size blow dryer, which I did not expect for some reason. But it is very light, and it dries my fine hair quickly with fewer ""frizzies"" than my old (now broken) one. I do not know if this is because it is an ""ionic"" dryer, as some have claimed. (I could find no documentation on the package, etc., to confirm that.) I give it only 4 stars because if it is ionic, this should be better indicated by the marketers, and also because I rarely hand out a perfect rating on anything. But on the whole, I am satisfied with this product."
5,Universal Truths with Heart,"ONCE UPON A WEDDING is as beautiful and as masterfully written as the cover art suggests. Buy one for yourself, your mother and your daughter. It is a woman's touchstone, a talisman to carry in your heart as one journeys through the rites of passage as a woman.Enter into Kathleen Eagle's ONCE UPON A WEDDING and recognize yourself in the mirror of her reflection.

This places them in your heart with ease."
3,romance,Interesting Protagonists. Don't think it will be conducive to planning a wedding any time soon.
1,Doesn't play MP3 CDs,"Just received the unit yesterday. Opened it today, and put in the MP3 CD that plays perfectly in my other boombox (kids wanted to use it so I had to buy another piece for myself). Wouldn't recognize the CD, tried everything that I could think of. Now, I have to return it. The unfortunate experience is that I can't even get to Amazon's return page - either that part of the App is down or something else is the issue. So, I have to try that tomorrow. Absolutely will not recommend this unit unless you want to go thru the pain that I am going thru."
1,The CD player on this boom box suddenly died after a few months,"I bought this because I sometimes like to listen to CDs and MP3 CDs at night before going to sleep. Initially I would have given this product a high rating but, for no apparent reason, the CD player on this boom box suddenly died about 5 months after I bought it. The sad thing is that I didn't use it very often so there was really no valid reason for the break down. I can only assume that this is a typical made in China piece of junk that deceptively seems to perform well for awhile. Buyer beware!"
3,Good for the price,"I wanted something inexpensive for my desk at work that had a radio and could play MP3 CDs. The radio tuner is pretty bad. I hear 2 or 3 stations at one time all the way across the dial. It just doesn't seem to be able to separate the signals. This product's redeeming quality is that it plays my MP3 CDs with no problem, and the sound is better than expected. If all you want is a CD player, you'll like it."
1,Ate my cassette!,Warning to people who want to use this device for cassettes: It ate the very first one I tried to play. Other problems: Poor radio reception and uneven volume when playing audio CDs.
3,alright CD player,What i like about the CD player:(1) Small- Good to use if you like to bring it some where or don't have a lot of space.(2) Plays mps(3) Cheaper them competitorsWhat I didn't like:(1) CD's skip really easy - Not good if you want to use it in a litte dust place.(2) The place where u put the CD's in is little deep and small- If you have big hands or long fingers its hard to get CD's in and out.(3) The sound is not real good. ( but what can you expect for the price. )
2,Lousy Value,"I ordered this unit for the MP3 player and the FM radio. It disappointed me immediately. The only MP3 controls that work are the play and stop buttons; you cannot use the next track or previous track buttons when playing an MP3 disc. The radio has an analog tuner which is difficult to tune. Finally, the bass is non-existent.I ended up returning the unit, it was so bad."
2,you get what you pay for,"If you want an inexpensive radio/cd player with average sound quality, this is your machine. It is just what I expected to receive for the price. Delivery was very prompt."
4,Pretty good value for the money,"If you're looking for a reasonably-priced, reasonably-sized boombox that can handle radio, tape, CD and MP3 formats, this is really your only choice, by which I mean nobody else even tries to fill this niche. Fortunately, it's a decent enough system. My only complaint is the radio tuner, which is analog and has a very small display. This means that, if you're looking for a low-powered station that has a more powerful station on either side, it's very difficult to get the tuner right on the correct station -- especially since you yourself are sort of an aerial, so the correct tuning when you're standing up isn't necessarily the right one for when you're sitting down. But if you're willing to put up with that flaw, it's worth it."
4,A good price/quality ratio,"It does well what we bought it for, that is, plays MP3 files from CD-ROM/R/RW. However, a CD should be burned at the lowest available burning speed to play properly (this, of course, increases the burning time). I had bad experience with some CD burned at the speed automatically chosen by the burning program: they would skip randomly, some files would not play at all. The same was true about an audio CD-R."
1,"Worked well, sounded good...","...for about 3 days. I used it at work about 2-3 hours, 3 evenings. The 4th evening, the songs were garbled and skipping. I re-burned the CD's and it still was garbled and skipping."
5,Intelligence Was My Line,"This book is a facinating read, providing never seen before insight into US Intelligence prior to and during the European Theater of WWII. I would highly recommend this book to those who are interested in the beginning of the US Intelligence Branch of government and WWII buffs."
3,Interesting but left wanting more!,"Interesting book and perspective. However I was left wanting more details, more information. I love books that give a true look or perspective into a particular area of interest. This that but it is very limited."
1,Intelligence Was My Line: Inside Eisenhower's Other Command,Very Disappointing.Found the book boring. I forced myself to read it till the end.Learned nothing from it.It read like an old guy telling war stories; stories lacking anything of interest.Expected to learn something about Allied Intelligence during the Second World War. Did notMike Walsh
2,nice if you dont need instructions ?,"I currently use this device like a memory stick , it basiclyhas NO software or operating instructions ."
1,Never again.,"This is the third Iomega product that I've owned that quit working after just over a year. Once, shame on you; twice, shame on me. Why did I even bother a third time?The drive seems to work fine for about a year. Then suddenly, without any warning, I start to get error messages that files cannot be written to the drive because of an I/O device error. Then nothing. Can't write to it, can't retrieve from it. This same thing happened with an early ZIP drive I had, then again when my DVD burner just quit working one day.I will never buy another Iomega product again. Ever."
5,Great Hard Drive,"Fast, Dependable, Affordable. A great deal for anyone going off too college that needs a hard drive."
4,I like it.,"This device does what I wanted. It makes backing up important files a snap and in a flash. I am not really very good at this high tech stuff, but backing up with this device, is very easy for me and so much faster than backing up to CD."
5,Great Product,"After seeing my parents lose their information several times due to poor computer products and incomprehensible back-up programs I wanted to get them a back up hard drive to store all their data. After reading the initial reviews for this product I was nearly scared off. However, we've had great success. It was literally 'plug and go'. The hard drive comes with no software and (perhaps not a benefit) no directions except 1 paragraph which explains how to plug it in. Either way, we've had no trouble and does the job I wanted it to do."
2,Defective,This item worked great for the one month it worked. I'm now waiting for a replacement because Iomega determined the equipment to be defective. I sneaked a peek inside before shipping it out and saw the hard drive inside is actually a Seagate. Maybe I'll steer clear of both brands from now on.
2,BE VERY CAREFUL before buying this,"Be careful. I've spent 4 hours in 'live chat' with their technical support to make this thing work. And it won't do what I need it to do. First, be careful -- it must be plugged directly into the wall socket(it won't work plugged into a power strip) and it needs a main USB port in the back of your computer unit (front, side, or alternate USB ports won't work -- less power to alternate USB ports they said). And you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it. According to Iomega tech support, Iomega doesn't have any product that backs up another computer over a network. Be careful. This is accurate -- but other printed things by Iomega don't pan out."
4,cute,"This book is cute, spoken like a true dog. But I don't want to read it over and over like Trixie's Bliss to You."
2,Some nice features but the product is destroyed,"If you are an expert Office 2003 user I predict you will hate this. The entire user interface is re-arranged.So when you're working and reach for your custom tool bar: GONE, not supported and destroyed during upgrade.When you think ""Edit, Insert, Name..."": GONE, no 'Edit' menu anymore, actually, no menus you'd recognize anywhere.I've been slowed down to the pace of a casual user.If you don't have this forced on you by a corporation stay away."
1,AC2,"There are only 2 things I liked about this game. The graphics and the crafting system.The worst thing about this game is t he combat system. The combat system is based solely on items, and skill level has little to no effect on combat effectiveness with primary attacks. Special attacks do become more effective as the skill gets higher.This game lacks content to keep the players attention."
1,Review of fallen kings,"I am a current player of Asheron's call, and i must say that this game was the biggest disapointment ever. The game has great graphics thats true, but it lacks a better combat system wich is one of the things use the most in a game like this and this combat system is way to basic and boring to be anything good. Furthermor there isnt that big diference betwen characters like in the original asherons call."
2,Wait 6 months,The fan boys and MS marketing would like to convince you to buy this game now but I recommend that you wait. Sure the graphics are nice but that wears off fast. The game has severe imbalance issues. Personally I find that character development and combat are boing and very unoriginal. While I thoroughly enjoyed AC1 I find that AC2 simply doesn't grab my interest.Maybe in 6 months they will have addressed many of my issues. If not then there will be something else to play with equally nice graphics by then.
4,Well DUH,"For all of you guys out there who changed from AC1 to AC2 expecting it to be the same great game, don't. AC2 was made in the same world as the previous but it's an entirely different game. You can't switch expecting it to be the same as the previous because it's not. This was Microsoft's attempt at another style of MMORPG. I encourage all of you who have tried it and didn't llike it to give it another try. But this time try not to think of it as a sequel so much as a new game. That will make it so much more enjoyable."
3,Nice graphics.... BUT.....,"I played this on a friends desktop and despite the load they were putting on it in beta, it seemed to handle well. One thing they don't tell you about on the pre-order page, however, is that it currently only works with GEForce series cards. I would be pretty upset if I pre-ordered this game and found that out the hard way."
1,Quite Disappointed,"I played the game in beta and disliked it but figured they would change things so I gave it a chance in retail. There are almost no changes from the beta which shows that the game was rushed and they didn't listen to their customers. Combat is extremely boring and a lot of crafting is bugged. Patches are coming in the future, but if they didn't fix things from beta, I have little hope for the future. The game doesn't even hit seven thousand people playing during prime times. Seems like a lot of people are disappointed like myself. Save yourself some money and wait on this."
1,This town ... is kinda like a ghost town,"""Say, where is everybody?""This review can save you a lot of time: This game is dead, dead, dead. Nobody on it, little to no meaningful interaction with those on it. If you pick a side, expect to get steamrolled by a maxed char pretty quick. The quests can be entertaining, and it might not be so bad if there was a decent population, but the lights are on, and nobody's home."
2,AC 2 needs more work done,"I practically lived in the AC 1 world for a year and half. After neglecting my real life for this much time I realized at the end that yes I did make some good friends, had some good times ... but most of all I just leveled a character and collected items for vassals day in and day out...You may be asking what this has to do with AC2, well, AC2 is really the same thing as AC1 - damn why couldnt they do more than just improve the graphics and copy DAOC. I was soooo looking forward to this game. I am an ac fan so I bought it anyway Olorin (Thisledown) reserved name but I am thoroughly dissappointed with the Beta. (except for graphics - they are ok)BTW Dont get tricked into buying a GFORCE card - they are reccomended by MS (becaseu hey have business with them) the ATI 9700 for desktops and the 9000 for your laptop run stable excellent graphics and are superior to NVIDIAs Gforce in every way possible."
1,Quite a dissapointment,"Turbine has created a great graphical engine (VERY impressive graphics on my Radeon 9700 Pro), but failed to make a game. After playing beta for 3 weeks, I'm not going to buy it because of its generally slow and boring gameplay."
3,Current beta tester,"I've been testing it for a little over 2 months now.In good conscious I can't rate it over 3 stars right now, but it is beta. Right now it has several severe flaws, chat, fellowship looting, balance issues & XP flow to name a few. But I have faith Turbine will fix allot of the issues it has, their live team has done wonders with AC1 & I expect them to do even better with AC2. Right now it is very content lite, but it is beta & Turbine has been really good about adding new content monthly with AC1 which will follow into AC2. :pWhile I can't give it more then 3 stars now, a couple months after release I'm sure I could give it 4-4 stars in good conscious. :D"
1,Dont buy it!,"There is nearly no one online!Dont waste 30 Bucks for this game, its really not worth it. Yes, it has nice grafics but thats it. Go for Star Wars Galaxies, UO or EQ."
3,Asheron's Call 2 disappointment at beta,"I have been a long time customer of Asheron's Call 1. I was recently invited to beta to play Asheron's Call 2. AC2 is a dummied down clone of Diablo and Dark Ages of Camelot. When I first encountered this game I was extremely disappointed with the content and skill/trades/armor system. I'm hoping that before it is released to retail that some of the kinks are worked out. It is impressive graphics wise, but we all know graphics do not make the game *cough Dark Ages of Camelot cough*."
3,Alot of bad things so far,"AC2 vs DAOC imoGraphics: AC2Content: na (daoc hda nadda out of the gate 2)Movement: DAOC (alot cleaner, AC2 you get caught on stairs alot)Races: DAOC (alot more choices, AC2 has 3)Skills/Spells: Tie. Loved DAOC skills/spells but in AC2 you can untrain them 2.GUI: DAOC hands down. Menus cant be resized in AC2 which is very very annoying.Quests: AC2. I love the timers that show in AC2.Radar: DAOC. I hope AC2 adds some more colors to mobs to know their strengths. I see red and orange..Travel: AC2. Gateways and ringways are damn confusing but once you die enough and run same route 10x, you can move very fast.Ill still buy AC2 but hope for huge GUI enhancements and pray for content."
3,"Pretty Graphics, Empty World",This game has the best graphics of any game to date....but it needs help. The server populations during the day are about 100 people and at peak about 450-500. This means that there are very few people to make groups with etc. There is a great quest system from lvls. 1-25 but after that boredom sets in quickly. Pvp and Kvk are fun but the system is kinda broken and the devs have said they are not going to fix it in the next 3 months. The worst part is there is absolutely no interaction with the world (as promise on the box). It is a fun game but (for now) it could only hold my interest for about a month.
2,Not what you think.,"If you were a fan of AC1 you are going to be sorely dissapointed. Your character will not be unique as they will have no attributes and the 2 stats that you get are the same for everyone at your level. You pick skills, but a much more limited number of skills, and every character cannot pick every skill. The only two types of quest are ""kill all of the monsters on this list"" or ""touch all of these bases"". The dungeons are not complex and all quests can be easily completed in a day without any form of organization or planning. It is visually stunning, but they have turned a classic rpg title into a glorified arcade game and if you were expecting better it flat out sucks."
3,It would be fun if...,"This game really does have it all. It has a lot of stuff to do and the enviroments are truely a marvel. The thing that takes away from it though, is that no one plays it. This game would be better than WoW if more people played it. It's peak population was like 600!!! Also, it has probably dropped now that WoW is out. Anyway, I would have to recommend WoW instead of this game. It's the same formula only 300,000 people play it. Your choice though, play with 600 people or 300,000 people."
2,no longer playable,this is an online game. it is no longer playable. do not buy this and expect to play it.
2,Need's Improvement,well I feel right now a 2 star is all i can give ...I'm sure some changes will be made ...don't care much for the vitae recovery system ...the distance a Mage needs to fight from even tho a critter can hit you from way off....all in all the xp system [is bad].....but will buy the Game in hopes alot more improvements will be made..
3,Has potential but ...,"unfortunately the most important part of the game, content, is missing. The graphics are stunning, even on low settings; the combat interface is similar to that of Asheron's Call, but the skill system is in dire need of revamping. The game is slated for major skill balancing and bug fix updates right at release, and although there will be monthly updates of content much like in Asheron's Call, if the updates are anything like the end of beta ""event"" then they will be woefully unexciting. Another major flaw of this game in my opinion is the PK system, there is no payoff for it, since no one loses anything on death, the only gain you get as a PK is a ""rating"" which, in beta anyway, was for nothing more than showing off. The only that I really liked about this game during the beta was cliff diving. And that's not a very compelling reason to pay for the game and a monthly fee on top of that."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have played most MMORPG with AC1 being my alltime favorite. Asheron's Call 2 is pathetic, and it feels almost like a joke. I will never buy this game unless the hundreds of basic issues are addressed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
4,AC2,"This game has tons of potential. The graffics are great. The skill tree is pretty cool. Combat is fun. The game is in beta right now and lacking in content, and is a bit unbalanced. But AC was known for there great monthly updates and AC2 is suposed to be easier to update and more flexible. I expect great things from the updates to make the already great game engine into a great game."
5,Great fun...,"Basically if you're not one of those gamer types that has to play a game 12 hours a day, you'll enjoy this game. It has lots of elements that make playing the game for even 15 minutes seem rewarding and fun. For example, virtually no downtime or tedium. Constant action to keep you interested. I've tried others in the genre like EQ, DAoC, and AC2 is better than the others due to graphics, no tedium, constant action, and fun gameplay..."
2,L....a.....a.....a.....g,I am a big MMORPG fan. I've played most of them. I have a cable broadband internet connection and I have not experienced this much lag since the initial release of Ultima Online back in the stone ages of online gaming.
1,Most disapointing sequel of any genre of anything.,"Vapid, redundant, glitchy, and disappointing. I liked absolutely nothing about this game, whereas I loved AC1 and played it for two years straight.Do not buy this second-rate piece of trash.I'm sorry that Turbine effectively destroyed the AC universe, but buying this game won't resurrect it, no matter how much you'd like it to."
1,A empty shell,"There is just no here here. It is being released in an unfinished state, even for an MMOG, and probably will get away with it. In an attempt to give players a chance to be unique, they have removed so much present in other games that being unique doesn't matter. A terrible design decision, and I do hope it does not inspire others. We are still waiting for the next leap in online games."
1,Been there done that,"This is the best way to describe AC2. They are furthering the genre with graphics. It's basically a pure level treadmill. They took out all the supposed tedious elements out of MMORPG but left the worst one of all, the level treadmill.No content, alot of imbalance, alot of bugs, your typical MMORPG release but a shame for a company on it's second try. If you don't mind killing things for years on end and nothing else this games is for you otherwise stay far far away."
4,Shaping up nicely,"Excellent graphics, crisp interaction, decidedly short on bug's (compared to some live games). Game play a little short on content... at the moment. It's only at beta but it's still more playable than a host of the current MMORPG's. A few months down the line and I'm sure Turbine will have filled the world with a lot more content. I personally look forward to roaming the brave new world. Excellent job Turbine... well done.That all said... Microsoft how about cutting your European customers some slack. A game release on different dates is understandable (shipping time etc.), but how about giving us the pre-order offer that Amazon.com have but with Amazon.co.uk. A chance to register an Avatar name at the same time as everyone else is a great incentive to game sign up. Don't alienate your loyal foreign customers."
5,Still In Beta,Game has fantastic graphics and an ongoing ever changing story updated monthly with live Devs who play in the game.
1,What a flop,"Nobody is buying this game. There are no people in this game. I can't believe how horrid it is. You pick some ugly character to play and then run around killing rats forever. I tried to do a quest but as soon as I got in the dungeon, other players started fighting anything I tried to fight. They were doing just to make me angry.This must be a game for teenagers that have no parents to teach them manners.The game is boring and I am sorry I bought it."
1,Asherons Call 2,"I have played the beta for 4 weeks now and all I can its been a very bad experience. The graphics are beautiful, but thats about it, no real classes are available and most skills either dont work properly or really have a small benefit after you put your initial credit in it, its totally useless to keep putting experience into it as the benefits you get are meaningless. I was hoping this game would be much better, but all I can do now is wait for the next big MMORPG to come out."
1,A very very disappoint follow up to the orginal game,"The game lacks the playablity, orginality, and creativity that made the orginal Asheron's Call a success, in my mindFrom my beta testing experienceIts graphics make the game cumbersome and extremely laggy, it needs a very top of the line system with a DSL or better connection to function. Its lacks abilty to be truely unqiue like in AC I. The whole system seems less realitic and a cheap mock of Dark Ages of Camelot (a game i can barey stand to play)I cannot stress enough to play at a friends house or beta test AC II before considering buyingI relaize some better issue will be resolved but not enough to make it worthwhileMaybe they will include Dark Majesty with AC 2 to bring fresh faces to the wonderful Asheron's Call Dark Majesty community"
1,"Please, don't do it!","There is nothing special about this game at all. Trust me. I wasted 100 bucks on this game for my wife and I a copy. We spent quite a awhile trying to convince ourselves that the game was fun but it just didn't happen.The graphics aren't as wonderful as a lot of people say and the gameplay is non-exsistent.If you want nice graphics and good gameplay try Anarchy Online instead, or even Ultima Online for that matter. Atleast UO has gameplay. I have played just about every MMORPG that there is and this one is by far the worst of them all.So do yourself a favor and keep your money in your pocket."
4,It is a blast.,"I've played AC1 for a few hundred levels on various characters, 2 characters on DAoC to 50 & played AO for not to long.After you play AC2 for awhile you realize that this game is actually more complex & fun then the others. It takes awhile to grasp why this is so, but when you do the game rocks.Amazing graphics (you are gonna need at mimum a decent computer)Slaughtering endless counts of monsters is not a must since the quests & vaults provide much better xp & offer a nice diversion from killing critters.Great Crafting system once you start to understand it & advance your skills.Excellent PvP gameplay at later levels.Turbine is well known for doing some of the best monthly content updates in the industry, and they havc twice the staff to do this in ac2 then they did in ac1, so you can expect great updates monthly."
3,Dont believe the Hype Either way.,"First off to clear things up there is Alot of fantasy on both sides. The game is fun, but currently lacks depth. The beta is very bare bones and there are core issues that need fixed. On the up side Turbine has a very established track record of adding content. If they fix the core issues, Chat being my biggest pet peeve for items that need correction, the game has good potential.A lot of the haters are AC1 fans who simply wanted a reworked AC1. This is a different game very loosely based on the lore of AC1 that is it."
2,Camelot Redux,Playing the Beta..Its the same thing over and over again. Since UO and EQ nothing new has been added to the MMORPG. The true poverty of the online gaming world is not in the graphics engines or the power of the hardware. The poverty resides in the game writers total lack of imagination.This one is EQ/Camelot warmed over.. no new stuff here.
1,A very very disappoint follow up to the orginal game,"The game lacks the playablity, orginality, and creativity that made the orginal Asheron's Call a success, in my mindFrom my beta testing experienceIts graphics make the game cumbersome and extremely laggy, it needs a very top of the line system with a DSL or better connection to function.

3,I played through the entire beta process,"Personally I found this game to very cool. The only problems I really had when playing the beta were the character wipes which hurt the fun aspect. The thing is that there were a plethera of things not added in the beta due to it being just that, a BETA. I expect the final version to be a great online game. Yes, there are no NPC's (this means no computer generated people to buy and sell from). I found no issues with this since I could basically make any item I really needed with no problems. Also bonuses are added to all weapons when crafted. Forges also help to increase your crafting abilities. I'd say if you want a pretty strong game which should be great fun with pretty nice players involved in-game then buy it. Its a great game. I plan on waiting just a bit to buy it though since most on-line games need some tweaking at the start. Also my computer is to weak. Need an upgrade. Buy the game its pretty and the dungeons are very cool looking."
1,"Nice Graphics, Weak Gameplay","This game can only get better but, that will take many fixes and patches. I would suggest checking this game out in late 2004 or early 2005 after its been around a while and most or all of the bugs have been fixed and the game content has been tweaked. As for now, its under populated, lots of bugs and, well, boring. Its too easy and lacks the ability of characters to be truly unique. Awesome graphics, but if your using a slower, older system and a dial-up modem ...... Forget it!This game is just not ready for prime time..."
1,Asherons Call 2 is the Worst MMORPG ever,"AC2 is basically a compile of Dark Age of Camalot, EverQuest, and Asheron Call 1. They Took Everything that was good from these 3 games as well as other MMORPG's on the Market and compiled them into one big mess.I have played Asherons Call 1 scince Beta and i must say that this is a Discrace to the Asherons call name. I for one and ALOT of the AC one player Base will NOT be going to AC 2. I will be staying in Asherons Call one untill another good MMORPG comes on the market and Asherons Call 2 is NOT that MMORPG!"
1,Taking a step Backwards,"After spending lots of time with AC2, I'm amazed that Turbine/MS has the nerve to release this stripped down unfinished product to the public.Instead of moving the genre forward, they have moved it backwards. This game is much more of a console type shooter than a MMORPG in everyway. They have removed NPC's from the world so you can't even shop for equipment. Also, while I did except the towns to be in shambles, I didn't expect the fact you couldn't even enter the buildings. In fact, Turbine has released a statement saying that even when restored, the buildings can't be entered.Forced PvP gank fests, No NPC's, level limits on boring items, char creation straight from Pac-Man and nothing to do except kill-kill-kill, make this game the biggest dog in years.Selling this game should be considered a crime."
1,Asheron's Call all hype no fun,If you liked AC1 (which was my favorite game for over 2 years) AC2 is a let down.Stick with AC1 and let this Dark Age of Camelot clone go by.
4,"Needs balancing, but mindblowing graphics.","The great thing about this game is its continuous story line, and constant updates so the game is ever changing. Game players can alter the future of the story and even the patches. The game is fairly stable, has amazing graphics, but lacks in areas such as certain aspects of game play and content."
4,Pretty Good,"I have had this game for about a month and I am still hooked. Microsoft must be putting nicotene in the game because I cant stop playing it. The gameplay is sweet, the skills are sweet everything is perfect. Its even too perfect I have a pretty new computer with a brand new graphics card and I still had to crank the settings down to get optimum performance. IT is a system requirements HOG. Otherwise, I reccomend this game to anyone who is willing to pay a small monthly fee for it. If your interested and want to find out more check these websites out..."
1,This game is a Major dissapointment.,"This thing is a content nightmare, the graphics are quite nice but the game content is horrible. After 2 weeks of game play you will have wished you never bought the game..."
1,Level Treadmill for sure.,"Ugh. Another Level Treadmill. Only two days old and I already see level 20 characters ingame. That's saying alot since there are not that many people in the game to find.Graphics = GreatGame Play = [very bad]People = Unfriendly (I suspect most are experienced AC1 players)Stuff to do = Nothing really.Kill something, move on to the next monster. Kill it, move on to the next. blah blah blah blah blah. Where is the interesting social interaction that online games like this are supposed to have?Worst game I have bought in over a year. Only game I ever wanted to take back."
1,Down in Flames.........,"This game is so simple compared to AC1, if you liked AC1 you will not like this. If youve been living in a cave and think DAoC is a good game, this might be for you. I feel like ive been ripped off."
2,Very Disappointing,"In a nutshell this is not what I expected after playing AC1 for quite sometime. Granted the graphics are outstanding but this does not make up for the lack of gameplay. Basically there is nothing more to do than run around, hack and slash, run around then craft some items to break the monotony. Thats all there is to the game."
2,I didn't find it any very fun...,"Graphics/Interface/Sound all okay. But my biggest gripe is the lack of anything interesting to do. You kill a few creatures roaming around, gain some xp, visit one of 21 ""vaults"" or dungeons (i visited 4 and they seemed standard in layout -- 1-2 creature types roaming around, and 1 boss creature type). The towns are all ruins (with horrible popup on my poor system). Most social activity seems to be gathering in one of these ruins and playing your instruments. There's no trading; more just giving out old things you don't need anymore, and the only use for gold is to ""gamble"" up a short term enchantment on yourself. In other words, no economy. Crafting items seems even more tedious than leveling up. People who played FFX on PS2, remember ""capturing"" creatures 5 times each? Sorta reminded me of that. Just didn't live up to my expectation of a 2nd gen MMORPG."
1,boring and clunky,"i've played Asheron's call for 3 years ... and the graphics for AC2 are pretty, but often get in the way of feeling immersed in the game. most of my friends and i will stay with AC1."
2,AC addict dissapointed in the new sequel,"I have played AC1 since shortly after retail release and have put literally thousands of hours into it. With that being said, I have don't think that I will subscribe to the sequel. It is a completely dumbed down, simplistic version of the first game. AC1 was completely immersive and unique in its game play. Save the amazing graphics of AC2, the game play is more akin to a console game. Unless they make great strides in improvements and paradigm shift changes, it will not be nearly the addictive experience that the prior version was."
2,Improved graphic but nothing new,"Nothing new here really compared to Dark Age Of Camelot except for better graphics.If you like running around in a ""dead"" world wasting your life beating on monsters day out and day in just to get xp and a higher lvl that no one cares about anyway, this game is for you.Otherwise wait for another more creative and intresting mmorpg game to come out and do something else during that time."
1,Wow! I expected much more!,"Microsoft. I expected way more from this game. After 2 days of online play, I am ready to quit. I met 3 people online! WOW. I got disconnected several times and could not get back on. I thought Microsoft was the big boy on the block! The game stinks."
2,They should have revamped AC,I beta tested this game for about a week. I think they should have just put all the nice graphics on the original AC. The game play is tiresome and simplistic. you get to do alot of repetitive stuff... woo hoo!
2,"OK, Kinda boring, first is definatly better","I beta tested the early and the late stages of this game, and I have to say it is not as good as the first. Graphics are tremendous, but gameplay is lacking. I personally will wait for World of Warcraft to come out. Should be interesting to see what they do with this game."
4,Wonderful,Was what I expected. Used it easily on our trip through Nevada and it helped us find every place we needed.
4,Frommers Washington D.C.,"This book is pretty helpful for a tourist in D.C. I referred to it several times during the course of my 7 day visit. What it doesn't make clear is that Tourmobile tours can be very frustrating. They are portrayed as easy on easy off shuttles, but in reality they overbook their capacity and cannot accomodate people waiting, thus prolong the wait and waste valuable vacation time for their customers. Other than not informing customers about the inefficiency of Tourmobile I'd say this publication is pretty good."
5,"Wonderful ""Foundation Course"" for Burlesque","This is a wonderful ""foundation course"" for anyone wanting to learn about burlesque. She makes sure to include a lot of the basic burlesque moves that can be used to choreograph your own routine. She includes glove peels, bumps, grinds, different styles of walks, and really explains not only how to pull your bra strap down in a certain way, but WHY! If you're interested in performing burlesque, or just want to learn some things to spice up your relationship, this is a fabulous DVD!! I can't give it enough stars or a high enough review! :)I've already bought her DVD ""Striptease"" and the Fan Dance DVD is next on my list! She's a wonderful teacher."
5,loved it,this cd is way too much fun. i have learned wonderful moves and it is easy to follow. great for self esteem
1,Bad instruction,This dvd had some of the worse instruction. I found this one to be useless if you are trying to learn this type of dance. The info for the dvd is very misleading.
2,Burlesque Is Not For Me,"I think I was expecting something different with this. Apparently, I did not really understand what burlesque is. I love the Lady M exotic dance DVDs and thought I would like this as well, but I was very wrong. For me, Burlesque is a little too raunchy. Having said that, if Burlesque is your thing, then this DVD is well made, her instructions are clear and she breaks it down so it is easy to learn."
4,Great teacher's reference.,I am recommending this book to fellow teachers and some students. It is a great teachers reference and yet easy for students to understand
4,Small but great,"This item preforms as stated. I was looking for a smaller unit, and this one is small enough to fit in pocket, and still work like a larger unit. I would recommend this product."
3,Works - but poor range,"It works, but the range is no place near that of the original full size. I have to be in the driveway and I have to lift the control to get the door to open. The original remote works before I reach the driveway and without pointing it out the window."
2,kiara era kiara,"todavia esta en el mercado pero este cd no es tan bueno, si lo compras te aburriras enseguida."
4,a fine introduction,Interestingly organized by sections on Velazquez' works; the historical setting and biography this book is a very well done overview. The major influences of Velazquez and the evolution of his own style come through in both the lucid text and the beautifully presented illustrations.
5,Insights on the meaning of destiny and God's will,"The Odyssey Of Enlightenment: Rare Interviews With Enlightened Teachers Of Our Time by Berthold Madhukar Thompson is a selection of interviews with twelve East Indian spiritual teachers, each of whom are widely respected for their enlightened wisdom. Hindu guidance to life-long harmony, the full depth of the immortal truth within Socrates' classic phrase ""Know thyself,"" as well as insights on the meaning of destiny and God's will round out this superbly presented anthology of spiritual acumen. Essentially a chronicle of Thompson's personal quest for spiritual meaning and eternal truths, The Odyssey Of Enlightenment is a welcome and highly recommended contribution to Eastern Spirituality reference collections and Hindu Studies supplemental reading lists."
3,"great book, unfortunate mistake","This collection of poetry is exactly the starting block I was looking for to begin my dissertation on the work of Rochester. Unfortunely I was sent another book to begin with but the company replaced it quickly and allowed me to keep ""Saints and Sinners"" by Eamon Duffy for free. Not perfect but I realise that mistakes are made and this was corrected to my satisfaction"
5,Makes Track More Fun - Easy to Repair Red Switch Post,"We bought a few switches to make our basic loop more fun. The switch comes with a quarter turn piece of track. You can change the side that the switch post is on from the left to the right. This is helpful since the post can get in the way on some layouts. It is well built and trains make it smoothly across the switch without derailing. They are a bit expensive, but it makes your train set more fun. Be careful when ordering because there is a left hand and right hand switch.2012 Update - the red switch post that you turn to open and close the switch can break. If this happens, you can buy a replacement post. To remove the old post, pull straight up on it. Then push the new post into the place. I agree that Lionel needs to make these stronger. The replacement part number is 6102017094 RED SIGNAL LEVER / FASTRACK MANUAL SWITCH. It costs less than $4 and you can buy it at a hobby shop or Lionel sells replacement parts at lionel dot com."
2,Not for unattended layouts,"The main difference between a manual switch and a remote switch is the lack of all electronic components of the former. The only way to control a manual switch is either using its fragile flag or pushing its rails manually. On the other hand, remote switches not only come with a remote control, but they are also self-aligning. A self-aligning (or non-derailing) switch automatically throws the switch to the correct position when the train approaches (e.g. in reverse loops or short cuts), and therefore prevents derailments. The manual switch is not self-aligning, therefore you will need to run and change the switches to the correct position all the time. Yes, if you have a heavy train going at a slow speed, you could expect that the weight of the train will adjust the rails, but I wouldn't recommend assuming that it will always be the case. Avoid frustration and get some remote switches instead."
4,Lovely old fashioned tale,I enjoyed this tale of love and justice triumphing over tragedy. It's pastoral setting added to the charm. the characters were well developed.
5,Aspen Mulling Spices,"A very good product. We got the first at Cracker Barrel and got hooked on it. They quit stocking it then, so we were able to find it on Amazon.com. Thanks very much."
5,Aspen Spice review,"The BEST cider spice you can get. Tastes great when added to apple juice, but better when added to apple cider. Wonderful in the winter months!! My Sunday school class really loves it when I bring it to church. They skip the coffee, and go for the spiced cider!!"
2,disappointed--not what was described,"Wish I had noticed Linda Moore's warning. Advertised as ""mulling spices,"" but it's really a drink mix--sugar granules with flavoring powder. Not a clove, cinnamon stick, or dried orange peel to be found. Labeling provided to Amazon description is misleading, and so is the labeling on the package. Buyer beware!"
3,Cute but design needs tweaking,"My 4 year old daughter received this as a gift last year. It is a wondeful compliment to her other pretend play items and I love the fact that it looks just like her own junior chair (Stokke). We like to purchase wood products over plastic and some can be quite expensive so this piece is a bargain. The complaint I have, and why I didn't give it a higher rating is that the seat and foot rest are made to just slip in and be held in place by the outer slants but the fit is not tight enough even though everything is tightly screwed in place. As a result they slip out all the time. The cross dowels are just slightly too long to permit a tighter fit. Very frustrating."
4,great chair!,I got this chair for my daughters Corolle doll and it's been a huge hit! Love the style and that it's wooden. It's light enough to be dragged all through the house and strong enough to hold withstand when my kids inevitably hop into the chair themselves!I agree with the others that say that the foot and seat plank should be glued on. They slide around way too easily. Everything else is perfect though.
1,Very disappointing - Don't buy this ...,"I fell for the Microsoft brand and selected this product from among a multitude of alternatives.The product lasted only three weeks, after which it simply stopped working. I talked to the MS technical support (which was very helpful, by the way), and we determined that the NIC was defective.I ended up returning it and got a similar Wi-Fi kit from Belkin. It has been working GREAT!!Don't be tempted by the MS brand. Look at the products for their own value - and pick Belkin, Sony, NetGear, etc. ... just not MS!!"
2,Does NOT included everything needed to network two computers,"Even though this kit clearly advertised that it contained ""Everything you need to create a wireless network for TWO desktop computers"" that turned out not to be the case. Because my current modem connected via the USB and not an ethernet card (like the majority of cable modem installations lately), I was told by microsoft that I would need to go out and purchase an ethernet card and an ethernet cable before I could use this kit to hook up both computers."
4,works great but......,"works great, but highly recommend visiting microsoft.com and downloading the fixware patch before installation. When I installed the wireless networking kit on my brand new sony pentium 4 desktop computer (with help from the tech support at microsoft) my computer restarted itself several times in intervals of approx 2 min apart and would not stop until I downloaded the fixware patch for the microsoft wireless router and installed it on my computer. After installation it worked perfectly."
4,"Working great, needed tech support however","During set-up of the base station (on an XP machine), installation could not detect my internet connection (even though all the lights were on, on both the modem and the base station). Tried to re-install and re-set the base station several times. Finally I called tech support, which was EXCELLENT. I completed installation (without internet detection) and then was told to power down both the modem and the base station. Once I did that, everything connected. I installed the adapter on my second PC (Windows ME) in about five minutes and everything has been working great, to include file and printer sharing. Speed downstairs is a max 11 mps. Overall, great product and great tech support."
5,How much time do we have to wait?,From time to time I see Amazon Music Store in order to see if this great LP is at last released on CD. I have all other BS CDs and this is the only one that is missing from the collection. It's incredible that one of the better work of this group remains unavailiable. Please let it happen!!!
5,An enchanting ethereal experience,"I heard this CD for the first time at a listening station at Borders and immediately picked it up. Tempting the Muse is a beautiful CD, reminding me of early Enigma - still one of my favorite albums - and Delerium from the Karma/Poems era. Unlike the more recent Enigma productions Mysteria keeps to the smooth mix of Gregorian chants, sexy female vocals, and deep grooves. Check out especially track 9, Awake Inside A Dream. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loved the first and second Enigma records."
4,Easy Listening at its Finest,"I really like this album and have it on many of my iPod's playlists--yoga/meditation, easy listening/study, and rock. Some of the lyrics are a bit hoaky, but the music itself is great. While entertaining, several of my guests at several parties have inquired what's on the stereo system. Its medieval meets 80s-esque style rock, ambient and delicious to the ears. Very original, in my opinion of course, and it remains a cornerstone of my vast and still growing eclectic collection."
5,Fantastic Album!,"This album is a treat to my senses- when I listen to it, I feel relaxed both relaxed and stimulated, calm and joyous... I want to both dance and meditate... Thank you Mysteria for your beautiful artistic masterpiece! Everyone who likes good music should own this album :)"
2,Mysteria: a cheap version of Enigma and Delerium,"While the album is acceptable for a random listen, Mysteria is B-grade music, but with the unforgivable sin of blatant copying of Moby, Enigma and others. There is plenty of room in the electronica space, no need to copy everyone; further, if you copy, you must make it better than the original. For example, the enigma-copy song has a bunch of blathering about infinity, serenity, divinity and other rhyming words, but it has no soul.Mysteria is the electronic equivalent of buying Safeway-brand products; a mildly watered-down and taste-alike version of the big brand-names. Only this time, you pay full price. :("
4,Easy to setup but didn't work so well with one computer,"I use this wireless router to connect two computers at home. Was easy to setup but didn't work so well with a PII computer running Windows ME.Initially I connected a PIII running XP and a PII using ME. I had to go through several steps everytime I booted the computer running Windows ME to get the network connection to work.After getting rid of the PII computer and getting a new celeron (still runing ME), I now have no problems.So beware if you have plan to use this with older computers."
5,EXCELLENT- better than SMC range,"I used to own an SMC AccessPoint (AP). I bought the Microsoft AP as a second AP to extend the range of my SMC by daisy chaining it with my SMC. This was going to require a lot of drilling and wiring to my house. But before doing this I decided to check out the range of the Microsoft AP.I installed the Microsoft AP and switched off my old SMC AP. It works about the same. But then I installed the firmware upgrade for the Microsoft AP. Wow what a difference. It now has sufficient range to cover my whole house, saving me the trouble of all the wiring work."
2,Not as good as Linksys and others,"I purchased the MS Wireless Base Station as a replacement for the Linksys broadbrand router and wireless AP (consolidate from 2 to 1 piece of equipment). Price and name were a factor for me. MS has never let me down....until now. It was very easy to set up and directions were clear and concise. However, the Base Station signal was very weak from upstairs to downstairs in my home (about 60 feet). Room to room was okay. And that was when it was up and operating! I experienced about a 75% up time with this base sration. I went back to my old reliable 2-piece set up with Linksys equipment (100% up time)! I'll stick to the proven performers from now on. MS has a ways to go to get my support on their networking hardware."
3,Super product but unreliable,"I brought this router and the notebook adapter to share my internet conneciton. Setup was very easy just using the quick set up card. The price is just great given that it is 5 times faster than the prior generation product. The Broadband management utility is a nice utility to visually manage and check your connection. The wireless encryption security feature gives you added peace of mind knowing that a roaming intruder doesn't piggy back on your internet connection.I have intermittent disruptions with the laptop to which the router is connected via the ethernet cable reporting 'Network disconnected'. This requires a reboot (and a labourous disk check up). Despite having all the updated firmware.My suggestion - research other products (Netgear, etc) also. Make sure you take advantage of a 30 day guarantee, if available"
5,Wireless that works,"I'd have given this 10 stars if it were 802.11g, but it doesn't really matter, since 802.11b is fast enough for broadband (and even T1 and T3!), and I don't transfer huge files between my PCs.I'd tried Netgear, D-Link and Linksys and was sorely disappointed by the limited ranges on those AP/router units. Netgear was the worst. Finally I decided to give this a try. I was a little skeptical at first since I wasn't excited about a Microsoft product. ""Plain and buggy,"" I thought. But, five minutes after installation, I finally got steady wi-fi signal all over my house, whereas before with the other AP/routers the signal would drop completely after less than 20 feet. It has worked well ever since. Very happy with it.There's a twenty-dol rebate until June 30. But you'll have to dig for the rebate form on Microsoft's online store site."
4,GET THE NEW FIRMWARE !!,"Very simple: With the original firmware 1.00 this product is complete ... ! Base station will loose wireless connections, switch ports will play dead, autodetecting 10/100 cards will fail etc etc. BUT, with the new firmware 1.08 (download and microsoft.com) all these problems disappeared and it works VERY GOOD !! Better performance, stable connections and it still looks very nice. Thumbs UP ! It's a shame microsoft is still not selling these in europe...i took one with me from my last visit to the states."
4,Great product!,"I was looking for a reasonably priced router that offered wired and wireless connections. So when the MN500 appeared in appeared in my Gold Box I bought it without hesitation, given the good reviews it has received. I have Windows 2000 Professional so I had to use the manual installation procedure. However, it was pretty straightforward and I was up and running in a few minutes. The documentation that comes with the product is good. The Base Station Management tool is quite user friendly. The only thing I did not like was that there was no ""progress indicator"" when I was trying to connect to my ISP using PPPoE. The status just showed ""Connecting"" for a long time. Luckily I realized I had typed in the wrong password and was able to resolve the problem. Overall, an excellent product."
1,Check with your ISP!,Set up and installation were a breeze...except the unit kept sending incorrect logon info to my ISP. As a result I had to have my password reset by my ISP.Microsoft Tech Support was quick to reach but unable to assist with the problem. Eventually had to return the Network.Check with your ISP to determine which Networking System they support!
1,Worst I've ever seen MN-500,"This router was difficult and confusing to set up. I couldn't get it to configure and tried three different computers. When I did finally get it configured it worked fine, until I bought a new computer and tried to run setup again and once again I had difficulties. I ended up buying a different router of a different brand. Maybe Microsoft should stick to hardware."
1,Never got it to work...even after 6 hours of trying,"After about 6 hours of trying, including the accidentaldiscovery of a firmware update I was never able to getthe wireless connectivity promised.The irony of the situation is that I bought the MN-500from Microsoft SOLELY due to the fact that I thought itwould be easier to install and get running.My friend has a netgear that he swears by, but I'll juststick to a physical cable for now. This stuff requiresWAY too much knowledge to install and configure. I wasnever confident I had it installed properly. I'd watchthe wireless connection show up as enabled, withexcellent signal strength, yet it never connected to a website. Then it would drop the connection. Then it wouldcome on again. Sometimes, it would require manuallyconnecting to the base station despite the fact that Ithought I had it set to auto connect.Basically a 6 hour nightmare"
1,It really didn't work for me,"If you have ANY other piece of wireless equipment in your hosuehold, such as portable phones, this device WILL NOT WORK. I got signals from 15' maximum, not the 150 feet advertised. I returned it and got a Linksys router with the Signal Booster. It is awesome. Microsoft, stick to the stuff you're good at please"
4,Great Router But Had Few Problems,This Router Was a Great Buy I Bought Another one later on it worked so great. Micorsoft Made A Great Router But I Have Had A Few Problems And I HAd To Call Microsoft Support A Few Times But In The End It All Has Worked Out And Because I Had Those Problems I Give IT A 4
4,Solidly built pans,"These are solidly built pans, good for a lifetime IF you take care of the teflon surface, and that means cleaning by hand, and especially letting it cool on its own--no sudden changes in temperature. My pans have lasted me over ten years, now, and are good products."
2,Coating flakes off,"It was a great pan for about a year, and then the coating started flaking off. It now has over 1/2 of the surface coating missing. You can actually flake it off with your fingernail. Definitely not up to Calphalon quality."
5,This stuff is fantastic,I would higher recommend Calphalon One cookware to anyone who likes good no stick cookware and is trying to avoid teflon. Great for houses with birds like ours.
3,satisfactory quality.,good quality but gets burned on high heat.It gets difficult to clean it afterwards.Scrubing affects the coating on the surface.
2,Too Similar to All her Other Videos,"I really like this series. Or rather, I would really like to own *one* of the DVDs in this series. Because they're all basically the same work out. Again and again and again. This grouping, incidentally, was probably my least favorite (to the extent that the videos differ), just in that it used an elastic stretch band rather than a ball. (I have a preference for pilates balls and weights over stretch bands. A personal thing.)If you don't currently own any of this series and like a stretch band better than a pilates ball, this might be a great DVD to get. Otherwise, it's almost identical to all the others, so I'm not sure of the advantages in owning it if you have another."
1,VERY ANGRY,"Today, I got your cookies. Do you know the date? 7th JAN.2013.Do you see the expiry date? 26th FEB.2013. I am very angry with this. I bought 60pcs. You think I can eat all in one month?VERY ANGRY!!!!!!!"
5,Works!,This finally did the job in extending my surveillance video cables. This is a must if you think you'll run short. Extra cables at Amazon are one of the more affordable sources.
4,Good Hardware,"This particular adapter seems to be working really well for my CCTV system's Siamese cables, the only minor complaint is that the connection 'nubs' are a little chunky, making them slightly harder than normal to connect cables together with some other adapters I've used in the past. I'm only knocking 1 star because there are a few easier-to-connect types out there.Seller had great shipping speed and competitive pricing. I'd likely buy from this seller again."
4,Wonderful serice,"This pan not only looks beautiful, but cooks like a champ too. Even heating and no burning, and easy cleanup. I only wish the roasting rack was stainless steel too. I think it would last longer and look nicer."
5,Exactly as promised,"I bought this based on the high marks it received from Cook's Illustrated in anticipation of a big family gathering for Thanksgiving. Before the big T-day arrived I roasted a batch of vegetables and they came out perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised at how easily it cleaned up. I cooked a 19 lb turkey for our family gathering and both the turkey and the gravy cooked to perfection. Cleanup was again a breeze. I couldn't improve a thing: the handles make it easy to carry even with a heavy bird, the tri-ply stainless makes for even roasting in the oven and even cooking on stovetop for gravy, the non-stick rack is sturdy and the rack's handles are opposite the roaster handles so they don't interfere with each other plus the whole thing is so sturdy that I'm sure I'll be using it happily for years to come."
3,Heat does not spread evenly,"I like to make gravy on my stovetop with the drippings, but I'm less confident turning my back on this pan for a few seconds to drain potatoes or something because, with the thinness of the pan, the heat does not spread throughout the bottom of the pan evenly. There are distinct hot spots."
5,Outstanding Value,"I researched many roaster pans before I settled on this and am I glad I did. It offers a truly stovetop worthy construction, no bending or warping, a great v rack, and superb heat distribution. The handles are comfortable and the pan fits perfectly in the oven. Compared to the AllClad, it is less expensive and better performance. A well thought out pan."
5,Superb quality,"Amazon was the only place I could find for the price I had purchased this roaster - just shy of $100. It was a gift for a family member, so I did not inspect the product until it was opened.This roaster is the best built cooking tool I have ever seen. I personally haven't used it to cook, but was told it was easy to use (and clean)."
5,Great pan,I headed it for the turkey. Even heat. Cleaned up nicely and without effort. It good too. Looking to use it many times for roasts etc.
5,Well pleased.,"This is a heavy, right, roaster. It is traditional to my notions, can be used to produce gravy in the basin, and seems right to my notions. I would prefer, and may eventually buy, a stainless or even cast iron rack if I could find it. I am a bit different here. I know most people love their no-stick stuff. I don't find that it is that much easier to clean, and the coating is... a thing of suspicion for me, health wise, aesthetically, and just... because. For now the whole things works well, and as intended. I love good roasts, duck, chicken, and other such. This roaster makes the light duty a thing of art. I've been a fan of layered walls too, for some time. It does make full range use of the roaster much more practical."
2,Poor product support by Calphalon,"The non-stick coating on the rack flakes off very easily and quickly with only a few uses. I followed the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and never used either scrubbers or abrasive cleaners on the rack, but the coating still disappeared. When I contacted Calphalon about purchasing a new reck, I was told that they do not make them available as open stock. I am now stuck with a very good roasting pan without a rack that I can expect to not contaminate my food with the non-stick coating. My upset with Calphalon (since they have been aware of this problem for some time) is strong enough that I will never again purchase a Calphalon product."
1,If you loved Plan 9 from Outer Space....,"If you loved Plan 9 from Outer Space,Robot Monster,or any other of the worst horror movies ever made you'll love this. Otherwise don't waste your time or money.I'm sorry I did."
1,Not acceptable for pool,I installed this item this morning and the plastic faceplate is already all fogged up and not properly sealed. This is a total piece of junk. Water will get inside the faceplate the first time it rains.
5,"Anointed is truly ""Anointed""","I got this album in November in 2005 and when I heard it I was so pleased and amazed I enjoyed every last song on the CD But My Favorites are Mighty Long Way, Jesus Is Lord, Gotta Move, Now Is The Time, and You Are. I would recommenend this CD to anyone in need of Healing."
2,Disappointed,"I gave ""Now is the Time"" two stars to match the number of selections I liked on this album. If you like Hip-Hop music, then this album is definitely for you, but it is not my cup of tea. I must say this is a big switch from their earlier albums, which were absolutely beautiful, with their gorgeous harmonies and soulful, R&B stylings."
1,Junk for the price,"Controls are impossible to use.Doesn't find photos that are more than two folders deep on chip.No user's manual. The quick setup guide is good, but not a substitute for manual.Frame and photos look great, but overall this is junk if I can't figure out how to operate it."
1,It looked good while it lasted.,"This digital picture frame looked very nice while it worked. That's where we have a problem. The first frame failed in less than 4 weeks. The retailer was kind enough to replace it. The screen just went black and would not respond to any attempted corrections. The second frame lasted just long enough to go out of warranty. After calling Phillips about it and explaining that two of theses had failed on me, you guessed it, they would do nothing. It's hard to imagine, that they are not having problems with this frame. What are the odds that I would have two fail in 13 months. As I told ""philips support, it would be hard to recommend there brand with this kind of support. Thus this review. Think twice before buying this brand."
1,I would give it zero stars if I could,"This thing died on me a month or so after I purchased it. The device would show that it was turned on but the screen stayed black. I tried resetting it, went online for support, called Philips, etc. to no avail."
2,Not user friendly enough,"Not user friendly enough. Looked nice and picture quality seemed good, but overall, required more expertise than I had hoped."
5,FANTASTIC PIC'S,I purchased this for my mother for christmas. I imported pictures of my children we had taken on Christmas day. I cannot believe the picture quality. Very clear!!! My mother loves this picture frame. I recommend this product.Thanx
5,Nothing but praise,"After failing to find a cheapo frame that was worth its desk space, I found my way to this frame, which overall, is just fantastic.It is easy to use: just pop your camera's memory card in and pick which pictures you want to copy onto the frame. That method is so effective I have never bothered to use the software to grab images via the USB cable to my PC.What makes this digital frame so good, though, is the bright, crisp, high resolution display that you can see from almost any angle. Put this frame on your desk, and you won't stop getting compliments. Pictures just look so good."
4,Beautiful Quality!,"The Philips Digital Frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that I've gotten. The resolution and picture quality superb, and the sleek outer design is an additional plus. Also, the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord, which is very convenient.As another reviewer said, you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want. It would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a BlackBerry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to.Also, I would like to see Philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well, that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the USB flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card.Thank you!"
3,Philips not up to their usual quality & performance...,"Well designed, beautiful images, great warranty.Would not read a 4GB SD card. Would not read a CF card containing more than about 400 images. Technical support didn't have a clue. They sent me a replacement unit which turned out to be a refurb with a bad smudge on the screen. I have returned both units. I have purchased many Philips items over the years and have always appreciated their innovation and quality. This was my worst experience with them. I'm very disappointed."
2,"Works well, but poorly documented and supported",I had a misunderstanding as to how photos were loaded into the frame. Having just bought a MP-3 player where I could transfer songs directly to the added external memory I assumed I could do the same thing with the photo frame...wrong. The frustrating part is the horrible Philips customer service. It took 3 different support people and a promise - never fulfilled - that I'd be called by a supervisior to locate a person who knew that I had to load the memory module separately to make the frame work. Sheeeesh. You can be certain I will never again buy Philips products simply because their customer support is so BAD.
4,Satisfied Customer,"I was pleased with the frame after receiving the product. My first choice was not available in time for the Holiday. I found this very easy to use after I figured out the arrows. The limited instructions only show you one set of directional arrows and their use, the other set is not included in the introduction.I bought two for Christmas presents. One made a great gift for grandparents to view the digital pictures they receive by email of their grandkids. The other was for my husband/our family to remind us of our recent vacation or other family event photos. Great way to view photos when you don't really have the time to sit down with a full photo album."
1,"Product didn't work, vendor's support couldn't help!","The item worked for about 30 minutes, then just stopped and wouldn't respond to anything. I called the vendor's support line; however, they didn't know anything about the product at all. Furthermore, they couldn't offer to do anything reasonable about a replacement.Fortunately for me, I bought from a local store and the store gave me a refund with no hassles."
4,Response on automtaically transferring from card,"I had that same problem with frame automatically copying all images on card to frame's internal memory when you turn it on. It did this when I put image files on card with no directory. When I went back and added a directory on the card named Philips and put the image files in that directory, it no longer auto-transferred them on start up. See if that works for you."
5,HUNTERDON COUNTY: A MILLENNIAL PORTRAIT,"THIS BOOK IS A VISUAL TREAT. THE PHOTOGRAPHER DID A GREAT JOB, CAPTURING COUNTRYSIDE AND SMALL TOWN SCENES THAT ARE PART OF MY DAILY LANDSCAPE. IF I DIDN'T LIVE IN HUNTERDON COUNTY ALREADY, THIS BOOK WOULD MAKE ME WISH I DID. IF YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH RURAL LIVING, PERHAPS YOU MIGHT WANT TO PASS ON THIS."
1,Poor range,"Plug in the Orinoco silver card and it's working perpectly. Plug in the M$ wireless PC CARD, it's not stable (80% of the time it loose connection) at all. Wast a lot of time trying it!"
2,not bad... for six months,"I had no problems using this card on a Windows 2000 notebook PC. I only used this PC/NIC card, on average, about 2x/week for about an hour at a time. The NIC card worked great... for 6 months. The card then slowly died over about a month's time. I would recommend against this card."
2,Not for 70-222,"The other reviewers have hit this one right on, particularly John Day. This book provides a good overview of how Windows 2000 is different from Windows NT, but it has almost no relationship to the 70-222 exam topics. The included CD is basically just the book in digital form - nothing special there, either. Do yourself a favor and start by checking out the Domain Migration Cookbook on the Microsoft TechNet website instead."
1,Very Cheap Lights,"I've purchased two different sets of these lights on two separate occasions and they always manage to fall out.The first set I've purchased was glued in by my mechanic and they STILL managed to fall out within a month.I figured I'd try again with the second set and they fell out within 2 weeks.The clips didn't fit well (and they will break easily while you're trying to insert them) and the entire unit wasn't housed or fitted properly into the vehicle at all. Even if you manage to get these in right, they will stick out by at least an annoying 1/2"" of an inch which ruins their visual appeal.Do yourself a favor and don't buy these."
4,Nice gadget,"It works just like a USB flash drive, but it has a much larger capacity and better cost per megabyte. Not as portable as the 40GB version, but it still fits into a jacket internal pocket. Comes with a dual head USB cable, useful if your PC can't deliver enough current to the device."
5,women's casual footwear,I bought these shoes for my college-aged granddaughter.She liked them a lot. I was happy with them.
5,Excellent Resource for Homeschooling,"This book is ""wonderfully made""! The pages are sturdy and all pictures are beautiful. Definitions are present for readers as well. We use this all the time in our first grade homeschool."
3,Word 2007--Not As Easy or Functional,"Microsoft was trying to make Word easier to use, but I find it harder becasue I have to toggle to find things; the ""ribbon"" idea isn't a great thing in my estimation. Another effect I've found since installing it is that I've lost some functionality in Outlook email composition now; it's as though Word and Outlook don't talk to each other anymore, so I can't insert typographical characters such as em dashes, and there's no Find and Replace. I'm not altogether happy with the upgrade."
1,This just gets dumber and dumber,"Word 2007 is now being forced upon us by it-departments all over the world. It is a complete makeover from the last version. The last version was ok. It was stable and for the most part you could find what you were looking for fairly quickly. Not so with the new version. It is a complte mess. And the program is extremely hard to use without reaching for the mouse all the time. In the ideal word processor, the mouse should be used as little as possible in order to maintain the flow. Alas, we have forever lost the best word processor ever in that respect, Word 2.0c. Now that was a great program. All the bells and whistles you actually needed. No stupid pets. Only took up 5 Mbytes on the hard disk."
1,What a mess,"If you liked the old DOS era when all applications had different commands and the clerical staff had a stroke when you made them learn a new word processing application, you will absolutely love Word 2007. However, if you liked the modern era of Windows applications whereby they shared familiar drop down menus, you will detest Word 2007. What amazes me are the glowing reviews this mess has received by the ""experts."" I guess computer geeks are like mathematicians: as long as something is ""elegant,"" that's good enough. Why should one worry about the dumb masses who will use the ""elegant"" product?"
3,BEWARE Word 03 Compatibility Issues,"BEWARE- they don't tell you upfront that Word 2007 isn't easily compatible with Word 2003...especially for those upgrading...a lot of the 2003 features and 2007 features do not work together, thereby many 2007 Word docs will not read in Word 2003 and visa versa. If you go to the MS Office website you can download a ""converter"" to convert 2003 Office docs to 2007 format, but who wants to have to go through that everytime..makes you wonder what they were thinking in Redmond, WA when they designed this new software? While there are certainly vast improvements in graphic look and capabilities...the Word 2003 non compatabillity is a serious flaw that they overlooked (or maybe they just didn't care how inconvenient and how much trouble it would cause their loyal customers. And you wonder why people hate Microsoft so much...wake up Bill!)"
2,Don't Like it Wish They Never Changed it,"The latest version - Word 2007 is a mess. I can't find the tools that I use all the time, I have to use the Help (which is not easy to find either) all the time to help me find even the most basic functions, like Print Preview or Search and Find.Why couldn't they leave what was good enough alone? Incidentally, when you save a file and send it to someone who has an earlier version of Word, they can't open the file because Word now saves files with a .docx extension, not the good old .doc extension. This means you have to use the Save As (not easy to find) feature to save the file as Word 97.I may be inflexible, but this is a major inconvenience for people who spend most of their waking hours in front of the computer.Sorry, Bill- This time you really created a mess."
1,TERRIBLE,"I have used Word for years and then three months ago I upgraded to the 2007 Version. There is only one word for it, AWFUL! I have spent aa much as an hour looking for an old, common command. I would recommend you not purchase it if you are a seasoned Word user. If you're new to it, perhaps, it will make sense!A. Brandes, PhD"
1,Everything you know about Word (03) is wrong (07),"I'm no word processing guru, but I'm a reasonably savvy computer user who has been using Word since the late 90's. I have no idea why Microsoft decided to completely change the user interface on a product that people have been using for a decade or more, but it is incredibly frustrating. Even simple things like saving a document or printing or finding the help menu will take a good 5 minutes of your time the first time you try to do them.If there was a ""classic"" interface available, I would use it without looking back. I do not like the new style of user interface, and if I knew what I would be getting, I would have never bought it."
2,Shoved down your throat,"After buying a new computer, I have used Microsoft word for 2 months. To me it's like buying a sports car to go down the store to buy a loaf of bread. I had Word 2003 and it worked fine for me, no complaints. In my opinion, Word 2007 is an over kill for the majority of users. To use the car analogy again, it's like Toyota telling you need to buy a new car every 3 years although your existing car works fine...They also tell you you need to purchase it with all the options...I guess that's how you become the richest man on the planet, force people to buy something they don't need or want..."
5,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AT A STREET FAIR,"I WAS IN NEW YORK CITY A FEW MONTHS AND I SAW A STAND SET UP WITH A DEVIL BABY, IT WAS A RUBBER BABY BUT IT CAUGHT MY EYE NONE THE LESS. WHEN I WENT TO THE STAND I SAW THAT IT WAS SET UP TO SELL MICHAEL J. DENAULTS FIRTS BOOK ""THE RELLIK"" (THE KILLER BACKWARDS) ILL BE HONEST, I BOUGHT THIS BOOK KINDA AS A GOOF, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A SILLY BOOK, BUT I WAS WRONG. I FOUND THAT ONCE I GOT PASSED THE FIRST CHAPTER AND INTO THE BRUTAL KILLINGS I COULD NOT PUT THIS DAMN BOOK DOWN (LITERALLY) I MUST HAVE READ THAT ENTIRE BOOK IN THE 1ST DAY. I WAS SO BRUTAL VIOLENT DEGRADING AND ENTERTAINING. I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE AWAY THE PLOT OR ANYTHING IN REGARD TO THIS BOOK, JUST KNOW THAT ITS FILLED WITH GORE AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. I EVEN FOUND MYSELF FOLLOWING THE MINI LOVE STORY IN THE BOOK AND ACTING LIKE A GIRL HOPING THEY FALL IN LOVE AND WHAT NOT. TRY THIS BOOK OUT, IF YOU DONT LIKE IT, ILL GIVE U THE MONEY BACK MYSELF"
4,the third of 3 phat shows...,"shorneyphish here again with summer tour reviews...as I have stated in other reviews, and under other aliases, this three night run was the top of the summer...perfect tease for bonnaroo, tons of great songs, including some covers that rocked the entire theatre...chill lot with lots of kind people, and tunes to satisfy the least of the cheeseheads..."
2,Not very thick,"I was hoping these would be stronger. I wanted them for carrying kitty litter to trash, but have had tears several times by the time got it to trash bin."
2,"Great Idea, not so great performance",This is a good idea but found that it did not seal well around the battery compartment which led to moisture on the contacts. Eventually the contact corroded and the unit stopped working.
1,worthless,Don't buy did not last very long. spend the money on something better that is last longer. I can't say anthing else.
1,Disingenuous,"First, Amazon advertises that this is an HD movie. No, not for those of us that don't have ""HD"" devices. It's only SD on my laptop. What!?Second, once Amazon confirmed that the only way I had to watch this title was to have it displayed in SD, I was expecting a SMPTE ECR 1-1978 pattern, which would have been appropriate, but instead saw a HD SMTPE pattern...in low res!Seriously?That's like taking me to an IMAX movie and putting panty hose over my head.And never mind that full I and Q modulations as well as the ""super black"" in the PLUGE of the signal is not part of the streaming!Disappointed, to say the least."
2,Mistake,"I didn't want to ""purchase"" Bars and Tones"". It was a mistake to click on it. This review doesn't deserve so many words."
4,some like it furry,"purchased 2 of these; one guitar player liked it, but it wouldn't work with his guitar; the other player's guitar worked with it, but he didn't like the sheepskin. Finally, it was a hit with the electric guitar which is so heavy and really wouldn't rest on a leg. Ultimately, a special martin strap converted the classic guitar so it could be used with the strap--so both of those purchased are back in service. Educational experience."
1,"A good starting point, but...","How about a bigger strap so I can carry the entire car around with me? As is, this is really only a half-way solution to the annoying ease and convenience of babywearing. More work needs to be done here; it's not yet living up to its full potential for asininity."
5,Handy,"This strap saves us time and provides convienence.We have a car seat stroller also however it is more convienent to use the car seat carrier 75% of the time.For casual shopping we use the car seat carrier. When we obtain a shopping cart, we mount the car seat. Having to lug around a shopping cart and a stroller is no fun.For a family trip to the beach we use the strap. There is alot of gear to carry and a stoller wont do any good on sand.For eating out we use the strap. Some places are tight in space and it is convienent to use the strap. Once you are seated just set the car seat on the table.For a mall trip or a leasure outting at the park we would use the stroller. Its alot of walking.If you do not have an SUV, the strap also makes mounting the car seat to the base with you child in it alot easier. You dont have to bend your back.In conclusion the flying falcon car seat carrier is a great tool to have in conjunction with a stroller when your out and about away from home."
1,What a ridiculous concept,"Is the goal of modern parents to spend as much time as possible not touching their babies? Why would you want to add the weight and bulk of the infant seat to the weight of the baby, when you could use a sling or carrier that weighs next to nothing? Why would you want your baby snapped into a car seat, having his development stunted and his head flattened, rather than being close to you and interacting with the world?"
1,"Wow, Why not just baby wear?",I cannot believe this even sold one! Take the advise of a seasoned mother and go buy a Moby wrap or a Ergo baby carrier! Those items don't hurt your back and the happy is SOOO happy in them. I used both (moby from 0-3 months and the ergo till this day) My son has never cried in one and I can wear him for hours without pain! (My son is 22 lbs)
1,Buy A Sling Instead!,"Why add more strain to your back and also keep your baby away from you? Car Seats are for the car! There are dozens of other ways to safely and comfortably carry a baby like a pouch, a wrap, a ring-sling, a soft-structed baby carrier, a mei-tai. [...], [...], [..], [...] - endless choices! And you can find some great inexpensive ones on [...], [...] etc."
3,but think about this. . . .,"I totally agree that baby interaction/ snuggling is THE most important. However,consider this: I have to bring my car seat into my son's daycare, as we only have one car seat and my husband picks up our son, and I drop off. I am not physically capable of carrying him and the car seat, separately. The solution is that we bring our stroller in, every morning, so that I can at least look at him and talk with him, and also in some attempt to save my back. Sure, we could have bought two car seats, but really, how much stuff can one have? That just seemed over the top, and we'd rather put our money toward other things. The falcon can help with the amount of stuff and lugging that two working parents are forced to deal with."
1,I Hate This Recording; Get the Denon,"Once again, I am merely issuing a community service warning against this recording in favor of the same group's infinitely better recording on Denon. This recording should not be on the market."
4,A Fast and Interesting Read,"While this is apparently the 18th Brady Coyne novel, I had not come across one before a friend of mine gave me this one to read.I read it in a day and enjoyed it very much. What starts out as a weekend on Cape Cod for Coyne and his girlfriend, Evie Banyon ends abruptly with the murder of a man who is apparently stalking her. Following a grilling by the gendarmes both are allowed to leave and return home to Boston and shortly thereafter, Edie disappears. Searching for her, Coyne travels to Cortland, MA, the home town of the murdered man and a place where Edie used to work. The remainder of the story takes place there with numerous interesting characters, twists and turns in the plot along with some surprizes and an interesting ending. Mr. Tapply's writing shows polish and style and the reader is swept along through the labyrinth he has created for his characters in a most enjoyable way."
4,Enjoyable Read,"While William G. Tapply has written many books, this was the first one that I have read and I enjoyed it. The editorial review of this book gives quite a bit of information about the story itself so I will focus on my opinion of the book. I sometimes find mystery novels by male writers a little dry, so I was pleasantly surprised with PAST TENSE. Tapply's experience as an author shines throughout the book. The character of Brady Coyne is multi-dimensional with his honesty, yet he walks around the truth and frequently uses his attorney status to further whatever he needs. The supporting characters and small town description of Cortland was amusing and accurate. The story itself was not fast-paced but rather developed steadily. There are several smaller mysteries lurking in the book and while you may figure them out along the way, it's still an enjoyable ride."
2,"Great atmosphere, ok art, not much plot",They tried to make it look like a real journal by including handwritten calculations and lists but then the rest of it was typed which destroyed the realism of it being a journal. The art is nothing compared to Bantock's.The story could have been interesting but you're totally left hanging with no explanation at the end.The Morocan atmosphere was a great setting and the writing wasn't bad but that can't make up for its short comings as a story.
2,A good-looking book in search of a plot,"With ingenious artwork evoking the color and drama of the Orient, and with moody black and white photography, Barbara Hodgson's book oozes atmosphere and draws the reader into an interesting, but undramatic travelogue in Morocco by two disparate friends and former lovers.But the tattooed map appearing on Lydia's wrist changes everything. It appears Hodgson, a writer whose talent is quite clear, had lots of clever ideas for this book. Too many of them, and the characters - including Allen and Layesh's family - remain undeveloped. There was a wonderful supernatural, time-twisting mystery and thriller on the boil which failed to fire. After Lydia's disappearance Christopher spends an awful lot of time in the library with beautiful old books sorting out red herrings from possible leads and too little happens after that.Two stars for the artwork because it is an undeniably clever device, adroitly woven into what there is of a story."
4,Wonderful Mental Pictures,"An Amazon.com feature led me to this title, and it was a wonderful find. Journal entries make the reader feel like a silent third traveller on this trip; the shapes and textures and colors come as easily to my mind as they did to Lydia's eye. The scraps that Lydia accumulates on her trip through North Africa serve as excellent illustrations of not only the things that she is seeing, but of the way her complex mind processes those images into meanings, much like her photographs and maps."
3,The art was interesting,but the story left us hanging and wasn't very thrilling. I keep expecting to see some good collage & assembalage with a good story - is that too much to ask or impossible to receive?
1,THIS WAS EVER SO PREDICTABLE,"I PERSONALLY DID NOT CARE FOR THIS BOOK, THERE WAS NO HOLDING POWER, IT WENT ALONG EXACTLY AS I IMAGINED AND ENDED THE SAME WAY."
2,Not up to scratch...,"This book has two good things: a well constructed north Africa/mystery atmosphere and Nick Bantock's art, that is beautifully unique. Apart from that, there is no many good things to be said about it. What it looks like a good story in the beginning, vanishes in boredom and ends with a disappointing closing. The story of a couple with extreme different personalities that travels together and she, one day, awakens with a mark on her hand that develops into something that looks like a map. It feels as if Nick Bantock wanted to take a ride on Griffing and Sabine success and though anything done in the same style would work. Well, for me it didn't."
4,Great cap,It is A great cap. It fits well and looks feminine enough with the pink and white stripes and wider brim.
5,Pink Engineer Cap,The pink engineer's cap arrived within a week's time. It was in great shape and clearly a quality piece of merchandise. The price was right and I would purchase it again.
3,Good product overall,"Installation was somewhat lengthy and more involved, with a fairly longer manual, than expected. It would not sustain a connection initially, and I couldn't find an easy and quick tech support (800) number. Eventually, I had to uninstall, then reinstall (twice), and reset my access point/router (D-Link DI-713P), and I was almost ready to give up. Finally it started working and no problems since (hopefully never). Maybe with the Microsoft base station, things would have gone smoother. I am not sure why Microsoft has to make a bigger and more complicated production out of things, and I wish in retrospect I stayed with D-Link products. I knocked off two stars because of this. The best part of my purchase however was the seller (just great), otherwise I probably would have returned or resold it."
1,Microsoft USB adaptor,"Gentlemen,The Microsoft Wireless USB adapter MN-510 which I purchased from you is a worthless piece of Junk...It would not work, It would not install and when I contacted Microsoft about some help to get it to work they refused to do anything because it was a discontinued Item...If you would like to have me send it it back to you, and you would return my money that would be fine..."
2,TAKE OUT AND AND PLUG IN,"It looks like I am the only one having big trouble with this adapter. We have a wireless network on campus. The first time I tried to connect, it just won't detect the network. After 30 minutes it just started working all by itself. But that's not the end of the story. Now every time I turn my computer on, I must pull this thing out after I have logged in and plug it back otherwise it won't acquire IP and keep on say ""Network Unavailable"". Some times I need to pull it quite a few times before it gets IP. I don't know but I would rather go for something else next time."
2,MS should stick to software,"Broadband connection software is great. Wireless connectivity is low to non-existent. If you are having problems with reception or dropouts steer clear from this unit. After having trouble with Linksys equipment, I tried the MS equipment and it performed much worse or not at all."
2,disappointed,"Got it in a local store together with the MS router. As a software engineer, I consider this adapter setup to be extremely difficult. (provided if you try to turn on the wireless security feature). The router itself is good though.Once I get it working, the software indicates connection is excellent while the speed is way below the wired connection. I am not sure where went wrong but the speed is really bad even I have a cable modem connection.I'd want to try a different brand."
5,"Works, looks good, what more could you ask?","Compared with most other USB wireless adapters, the MN-510 is small and looks good. And it works very well too. I installed it in seconds with my Windows XP system and it worked flawlessly from the start. What more could you ask?"
2,A nice piece of technology when it works right,"I have purchased a total of 2 of these USB adaptors for my laptops. They work fine, if you don't move them very much. However, due to the mobility of laptops, which Microsoft may have overlooked when designing this, both of the USB plugs have developed a short. If you wiggle the cable just right it works fine, but if you try and move it after that, it shorts out and stops working. Laptop users be warned"
2,so so,The installation was fine but when I wanted to network to anothercomputer the router turns off everytime the base computer is off.So if I want to work on the second computer I first have to startup the main computer then make sure the routing number is up andworking(lots of times is not) then go to the second computer towork.
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this tent around Christmas, 2009 to accompany my son camping with his boy scout troop. After the second time camping, the poles started snapping. They are not sturdy at all. I will say it did make it through a rain storm with no leaks. Unfortunately if a strong wind comes along, it collapses, unless you have it staked down. I used the stakes that came with the tent, which are flimsy aluminum. They bent the first use. I now have to use thick plastic pegs to keep the tent stationary. It does go up easily, as I can get it up in about 15 minutes by myself. Other than that, I am looking elsewhere for a more durable product that can withstand a monthly camping trip, not an occasional one. The tent was cheap to buy but I guess you get what you pay for. Now I have to invest in a more expensive product."
3,With All Due Respect To The Earlier Reviewer....,"I don't own this tent, but I certainly would consider it. Most tents, especially less expensive ones, need to have some seam sealant applied to them before using in wet weather. It costs only a couple of dollars and takes less than an hour. It's like running a large Chap-Stick along the seams, them letting it dry for a half hour. My own tent is a cheap Wal-Mart one and it has been bone-dry in blinding thunderstorms."
4,Easy to use,"I found this tent very easy to setup and take down. I have not yet used it for overnight camping, but while setting it up for a test run, i found it's ease of use, size and roominess all acceptable. The instructions where well written, and i had no problem with any of the aspects of this piece of equipment."
3,Great but don't forget to waterproof!,We bought this tent for me to haul up 5.5 miles to a mountain lake to sleep our family of 5 for two days. Luckily we stayed somewhere a night or two before and found at that this tent definitely needs seam sealer. The tent is huge and pretty light but I have never actually had to waterproof a tent before and I've been in some real soakers. That said I definitely do think this tent was a good value and worked well for us. I think if the rain fly were setup just a bit differently then maybe it wouldn't have needed sealed.
1,Do not waste your money!!!!,"I bought this tent for weekend camping tips in the spring and the fall. The very first weekend camping, I got caught in a rain storm and the tent provided no shelter. The tent leaked from all possible areas...thought the roof, the windows and the door! Please, please do not waste your money buying this tent. I will never purchase a Wenzel product again due to the experience of this past trip! Pay a little more for a better quality tent and product."
1,Not very protective,"I bought this tent for camping purposes, but when I actually used it during camping, it rained, and this tent helped the rain come in through the seams, rather then keep it out."
3,yea,"nice tent plenty of room, but if it rains dont leave anything pressed against the edge of the tent, the water will seep through and soak anything in the tent. if you buy this tent, i recommend you get a tarp to place over it to keep everything dry when it rains."
1,not suitable for bad weather,"Had to throw it away after the second excursion. We suffered terrible nights, chilly and wet. The wind enter from all places. Terrible design. My daughter ended sick with fever and sore throat."
2,Ponderosa,"I received 2 tents, all shipped individually, which was rediculous. Both tents flys leak at the seams. I called the mfg. They suggest I go buy some seam sealer and put on. New tents should not leak at the seams or anyplace else"
4,Fit the bill and made the weekend trip OK,"Bought this tent for Motorcycle camping.Its light, easy to set up and huge for 2 people.Didn't rain, (Yea!), so I can't say how it will do from that stand point.All in all meets my needs very well"
4,AWESOME!!,"With a lot of tents, you will need to put down tarps underneath them. You do not need them with this tent! I had it set up on wet land and it rained at night, and I stayed perfectly dry!! As for the 4person, 2 room part, I disagree. It is a very tight 2 room 4 person tent. If you set it up w/ a queen air mattress if fits two people with room to spare."

3,Could be better,"It wasn't too bad overall, but it did not taste quite like the traditional egg nog you buy in the store. I don't think I'll buy it again unless I'm really jonesing for some egg nog come summer."
3,Liquid egg nog still the best,"I purchased this product as liquid egg nog has such a short season in stores. It is just okay when mixed well with a milk product, but I will still opt for the liquid every time."
1,What a Christmas Joke,"This has to be the Scrooge joke of Christmas, for the price it is so small only made 2 glasses.The taste is nothing good at all, just plain tasting it is nothing great.Says you can get one quart, you only get two small glassful.For the price they charge, for such a tiny amount, the profit for them is very high.If you want something to just add for a tiny flavor, go ahead. But if you want this for Holiday cheer, dont waste your time.Of all the things I have bought on Amazon, this has to be the biggest loser product they sell.I would send it back, but they said once it is open, sorryWant to have a good Christmas, dont buy this to entertain your family or friends with.Shame of such a rip off product"
5,More than just finances...information for your entire life,"This book opened my eyes to a whole new world. It has taught me so much. It is different than the usual ""get out of debt"" type books, it walks you through step by step on how to do everything! There is nothing that this book does not cover. From getting your finances in order and tackling credit card debt, to going into business for yourself, buying a home, getting more money at tax time, saving plans, the list goes on and on. I truly enjoyed reading the book because I was learning tons of things that I never knew. I have read this book more than once, I use it as a guide anytime I come across anything questionable dealing with my finances. It is a great book!"
1,The book would be good toilet paper,I read this book and it was pure garbage. Everyone should read the reader comments from the author's FOREX Made Easy book about how he disguises advertising his ridiculousy overpriced software/scam throughout the book and this book is the same. This should be a free book. The current reviews on here must have been posted by the author's employees because the book sure was pure crap.
5,Lovers In Arms makes BEAUTIFUL musica!,"This CD is beautiful. The beats are danceable, the soundscapes are very fullfilling, moving from Chicago House influences, to old-school hip hop. The vocals and lyrics are lush, sexy, and entrancing...this is the next big thing outta Chicago!!!!!Be one of the first before the rise to stardom! BUY THIS CD!! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!"
1,Pretty but not useful,"This book of puzzles is the most frustrating one of many I have bought. The numbers are put into pretty design arrangements that have nothing to do with the difficulty of the pattern. Some labeled beginner are quite difficult, while at least one labeled intermediate had only one step logic involved. I like to know the difficulty level before I begin so I can choose one appropriate for the time available and challenge that I am in the mood for. You have no idea with this book. There are many good books available, no reason to buy this one."
1,Beware!,"I used to read books, now I play Sudoku!The positive aspects of this Sudoku book is the large format and for six bucks there are over 200 puzzles. Also, the advanced puzzles are very challenging, more so than other Sudoku books.I was struggling for HOURS with advanced puzzle number 61, located on page 208. I finally looked at the answer page, only to find out that the book has a mistake! The puzzle gives you a 1 and 9 in the middle row of the center of the puzzle (Columns 4 and 6, Row 5). The answer key shows the 1 and 9 in row 6!! Whoops . . . .Unless you feel like checking every puzzle for mistakes, I would recommend buying another Sudoku book."
2,Sudoku: More than 200 Fun and Challenging Japanese Number Puzzles,"This book was fun, however, the rating system was not relevant to the individual puzzles. For example, a beginner puzzle at level 3 difficulty was MUCH more difficule that an advanced puzzle with a difficulty rating of 4 or 5 (top of the scale). Also, there was one puzzle (I guess on page 208) that had a wrong solution. This was the only mistake I detected. If you treat each puzzle as an unknown difficulty rating, this book is GREAT!"
3,Answer typos,The answer for intermediate puzzle #50 has two of the same numbers in the center section of nine cubes. I hope the puzzles are printed with more accuracy.Love the game.Doug Gardner
2,there are better books with the same message,"I found this book to be very boring. It was written in a very monotone sort of way. It does have some helpful advice, but everything in it seems to be what others have already written about. I was very disappointed. A much better read that hits on almost all of the same ideas is called ""Peaceful Parenting, Peaceful Kids"" by Naomi Drew."
5,Touching and informative children's book,"I purchased this book for our grandchildren who were fortunate enough to see baby loggerheads hatch on the beach at Hilton Head this summer. Knowing it might be a once in a lifetime experience, I wanted them to have a rememberance of the event. This book's lovely illustrations and informative story line did just that. It gave all of us a chance to relive the turtle's life story and learn some new facts about loggerheads as we read the book together."
2,Probably not such a good buy,"Plenty of glossy photos of Sealyhams; but the book was more of an essay about the personal successes one or two breeders. Sadly the book did not focus on the breed qualities or characteristics, and worse the breed data, & facts were often old and misleading. I had misgivings about the book's accuracy and I agree with other reviews in here that the book's content was old and out of date by 20 years. The book is probably not a good value"
2,Mac book,"The book was ok, but the same pot boiler material appended to most generic dog books. There wasn't anything special about the book in that regard, not much history or description that distinguishes the breed from anything else."
5,A breeder of Sealyham Terriers in the US,"This is a that the Sealyham Terrier has needed for many years. Although not a in depth history of the breed, as I am certain it was not intended to be, this book provides all the necessary information for a new Sealyham owner and also anyone who owns or is owned by a terrier. Insightful text, the breeds standard and an explanation of why these traits are needed and preferred along with wonderful photographs that are reproduced beautifully. Documented here are some of the current top winning show dogs and much loved pets, written by a well respected AKC Judge."
3,Black Gates Of Mordor set A Letdown,"I couldn't wait to get this set.I got it,what a letdown.The only figure i needed was The Mouth Of Sauron.The head and face are awesome.The body's sucks.Its so cheap looking and it don't even stand.One foot is all bent out.If your recieving this figure for a gift great.But if you have to shell out your own money like i did,Don't get your hopes up."
2,The PMP 300 is back!,"Wow, I have this mp3 player...the problem is: I bought it 1999, and it was then called the Rio PMP 300.This version, the Rio One, is basically an upgrade in memory of a five year old player. Same media, same case, different colors. I have a lot of problems with mine, but mostly flakey, annoying problems. It works...sometimes.So, be forewarned: this is a first-generation mp3 player. It is the digital audio equivalent of the dodo. Nice and meaty, but don't expect it to last."
4,A good little player...,"I recently bought this player and was pleased with it. It is a great little MP3 player -- if you want to only hold approx 15 songs at a time, otherwise I reccomend that you also buy an additional 64mb card to go with it. All around a good product."
1,"dont be stupid, dont buy this","bad would be a good word for this product. I am writing this in the first day that I have this product. It sucks really bad. It sais that it costs $100 regularly.Ha ha ha, I wouldn't pay 50 cents for it, let alone $30."
1,Avoid SONICblue products,"I bought a RIO One in July. The software was OK but not easy for a beginner. Not intuitive for the MP3 player use.Controls are limited, even though the buttons are big, the circular configuration works against itself.Low memory of card requires purchase of more MB or else constantly using USB to change songs.The RIO one stopped working after one month of use, in August. I finally got an RMA from customer support in Sept. You must call their customer support line, which is not Toll free, and will cost you big $$ if your question is not under warranty. Also the Customer Support phone line is impossible to get through on.Four months later no returned product and not much of a response from customer service.Spend you money on another brand and avoid SONICblue.SONICblue products are faulty and they don't honor their warranty, buy another brand and avoid SONICblue."
1,one more for the junkyard,"I don't write many reviews, I just don't have the time. But I can't pass up the chance to tell everyone what a piece of ____ this player is. I'm just going to be redundant, because everything negative that anyone here has listed is true. I've had both the 32mb and 64mb versions (got the second one free through a rio employee, but paid too much for the first). Both died just after the three month warranty period (not to mention the faulty buttons and software prior to that death), and rio could care less. I just don't understand what's wrong with these units that every single one could die. There is no quality control. These are my first rio purchases, and I could never in good faith purchase another rio product. Listen to everyone here and stay away, no matter how cheap. You will just be throwing your money away. Take a hint from that 3 month warranty, it's pretty clear that Rio knows these will not last, so they won't stand behind their product."
1,Don't even think about it,"I own a 32mb version.if it only works..., it was a pretty good sort of options, wma, just 1AA, smartmedia upgrade, usb conexion, zero configuration requiered for WinMe, Win2K, WinXP, but it just don't work, I bought 1, in least than a month, it goes death, I email to amazon, they send me a brand new, which runs flawless for 5 months, same history goes death, by now, amazon warranty expires, then I email to sonicblue, BIG MISTAKE, they answer me in one week, and told me that my email requiers more time, that was about 2 months ago, never hear anything else from them...just make yourself a favor, never bought anything from sonicblue."
1,"Customer Service gets back to you fast, but often","I've had to trade mine in 3 times. They have a poor quality product here. It's small, and when it works it's nice, however it doesn't work nearly enough. Software errors can make the device inoperable, and I've had three so far. It will simply blink with no other functions available.Customer service got back to me quickly with each return, however I was out shipping and handling for each return as well as went 4-5 weeks each time between getting a new one.The UBS cable is smaller than most UBS devices, so if you have only one or two UBS ports open you might want to think about how often you'll have to unplug things rather than sharing a UBS cord with another device.For $..., maybe, but for $..., it's not a good deal at all. I recommend a CD-MP3 player for durability."
3,Billiards,I can't get through the book. A little heavy. A video on You tube is easier to understand.
5,Used Pool & Billards by Robert Byrne,"Delivery was quick, price was economic.A remarkable complete and well written book with many illustration on methods to handle the cue and lining up delivery of the cue ball. Easy to learn the rules for the many pool games one can play. All one needs is practice, practice and more practice.Anders Roald Anderson, Edmonton, Alberta."
1,Horrible tuner,"This tuner is only good for standard tuning, and it barely does that job right. Correctly tuning an acoustic guitar is nearly impossible with this thing. This is a horrible tuner. Don't buy it. Drop a few extra dollars on something that can tune better and more than just Standard Tuning."
5,"Why pay for more, this is a great product","I've used this mascara and primer product for many years and it measures up to the more expensive couture brands for less money. And it is one of the few products my eyes seem to like, I often have allergic reactions to masacara, regardless of the brand or reputation. Let's face it, mascara is goop no matter who makes it, some have more irritating additives than others. Ditto with the primers. All primer material is pretty much the same so just depends on how much you want to spend for it."
1,"great mascara, terrible vendor","I am a huge fan of the Revlon Lash Fantasy Mascara and have used it happily for several months. However, I recently ordered a replacement from this vendor over the 2-pack from Target (Revlon Lash Fantasy Total Definition Mascara, Blackest Black 101 .15 fl oz (4.4 ml)) because it was $2 instead of $7. Big mistake as the mascara which arrived was unusable. It is literally all dried up as if it is a very old product--only clumps appeared on the wand. You get what you pay for, I guess."
4,A non-British history of Jamaica.,"Sherlock does a lengthy look at Jamaican history from a Jamaican point of view, with a special emphasis and sympathy to the enlsaved majority of Jamaica. Although most of the material in the book is not new, the interpretation is fresh, and from a perspective that has not been heard from often in works dealing with Caribbean history."
4,Packs a punch,"Nelson might get a bad rep for sticking too much action in a short space, but I found this first book to be outstanding. He knows his seamanship and how to write a villain that is completely despicable. I'm excited to find an American writer attempting to write an American Hornblower!"
4,"great stories, lousy proofing","Alright, this is mostly a quibble. These books are rousing stories and Nelson has a wonderful talent for evoking the period and feel of 18th century America and the revolution. But he needs to fire his editor. Nothing ruins a good read more than suddenly slamming against a mis-spelled or inappropriate word or phrase. This whole series is full of them: a man talks of his wounded hand ""heeling;"" he uses ""then"" when he means ""than,"" and vice versa; and most exasperatingly, he continually mis-represents the name of the American warship Andrea Doria as ""Andrew"" Doria (arggh!). Overall it seems the publishers have mistaken thier spellchecker for a good proofreader who knows his subject. Oh well, I still can't wait for the next book. Great stuff! (oh, and by the bye; people are hanged, pictures are hung)."
3,Shiploads of authenticity,"Even authenticity can be overdone, and those of us who don't know our backstay from our starboard leech may at times feel drowned by the ocean of detail Nelson incorporates into his story. There is however an excellent labeled diagram of a brig of war, to help the reader. The author's storytelling skills are first rate, his handling of dialogue less good. Other reviewers have drawn attention to the anachronous 'okay'. What jarred with me was the utterly unconvincing vernacular of the British seamen.There is no great theme, message or purpose to the story. It is a straightforward, action-stuffed nautical adventure yarn. The action is excitingly and memorably handled. It is a limited theatre of action though, for there is not much to do except shipwreck, mutiny and collide with another vessel. If you a fan of the genre, your list is probably headed by Forester and O'Brian. What better name than 'Nelson' to add to that list?"
3,"Exciting, but a little over the top","This book is very exciting at times, but it also has its weak points. Nelson does a good job of keeping the action going and he also does a good job of describing the intricate workings of a man-of-war during the late 18th century. I also think Nelson made a good decision by having his books set during the American Revolutionary War and told from the American point of view. The sea novel about the Royal Navy set during the Napoleonic Wars has been done to death and done well by many other authors. Now for what Nelson doesn't do so well. Nelson's writing is not nearly as smooth or brilliantly descriptive as Patrick O'Brian. His characters are mostly one-dimensional, much of the plot is predictable and some of the action is a little unbelievable. I have to admit though, in spite of its flaws, I did find it reasonably entertaining."
4,The American Revolution - from the US point of view,"As an Englishwoman, naturally I have always looked at History from the UK point of view - I was fascinated by Mr Nelson's novel, it is full of adventure, - romance - sailing detail, fun ... and a refreshing insight to the opposite point of view.I might be English but Huzzah for Isaac Biddlecomb!And there are another four books to read in the series - double Huzzah!"
5,"Highly enjoyable, historical nautical fiction.","Nelson writes revolutionary war era fiction in the rich tradition of Kenneth Roberts but in the naval setting brought to us with such splendid detail by Patrick Obrian. His characters are well developed with special attention to what motivates the various individuals in the ocean going arena. Nelsons main gift to us is Captain Biddlecomb, a passionate sailor and reluctant revolutionary who sees both opportunity and loss in the British mandates on the colonies. Fortunately, for the reader who veiws Obrians work as overly detailed and wordy (of which I am not one), Biddlecombs adventures run with the pace of a Sabatini novel, like Sea Hawk or Captain Blood. This is good reading. Buy all of this guys books, I know I'm going to."
4,Great for my young drummer,I bought this metronome on the advice of my son's drum teacher. It seems to work well. My son enjoys practicing with it. He uses earbuds with it so that he can hear it over his own drumming
3,Wish I would have known before I bought it....,"I am a piano teacher with 3 children at home that also play the piano. We got this for Christmas last year, and this was a very basic and affordable metronome that will get the job done. However, it always sounds louder on beat 1-which drives me and my children CRAZY! If this one feature wasn't so annoying-I could easily give it 5 stars."
2,Not loud enough for saxophone,I bought this for my son because of the low price but his teacher tells me the sound is not loud enough (he plays saxophone).
4,Good for what it is.,"This is one of those albums you hear in the gift shop, get hooked by a song, and impulsively buy. Usually this inevitably is met with some future remorse because somehow it just wasn't as good as you had remembered. This album, however, has yet to disappoint. Yes, it's formulaic, but the level of skill brought by the musicians makes up for it. Best of all: no synthesizers. All 100% real honest-to-goodness instruments."
5,the soulmate of coffee,"well now i no longer have to wait for friends to send me arabic coffee from palestine, i can make it myself here in the US of A. i typically roast a handfull of cardamon and then mix it with the Arabic Yemini coffee -also from amazon- and grind it realy fine. this makes a perfect cup of coffee.cardamon is also great on ground meat, i usualy add it to my burgers and they taste fabulous."
2,Rear Wheel Brake Does Not Work Well For Me,"I am married to an aluminum walker to get around.I badly need some means to brake the walker at times, as in going down steps or inclines.These brakes depress too easily for me. I cannot walk very quickly as any pressure puts the legs to the ground to brake and i have to let up to move forward.I need some means of braking that I can control by hand it appears."
2,Should have been fun,"It's a great concept and could have been a wonderful game. The graphics are just awful--not even good cartoons. There should be a playable tutorial to help newbies get started, but instead you just kind of stumble through it, learning as you go. Even with that, I hoped it might be fun once I got into it, but it crashes frequently. I wasn't expecting perfection but I certainly didn't expect to be this disappointed."
1,This game stinks,"I bought this due to all the rave reviews, but the people who love this must never have played a realistic PC game like the Nancy Drew series or the SIMs. The graphics stink and the manual is almost useless. If anyone created a realistic horse game that was fun they would be a millionare from all the horse addicted girls and women out there. The best i've seen so far is the barbie game for the playstation."
3,Confusing!!,"This is a great game, the horses are pretty and all, but my two friends have this game and the day after my second friend got the game, she said she has 20,000 dollars!! She has all the upgrades, and all she says is ""you have to upgrade the guest house"" I try to, but nothing happens!! Please help!!"
2,"Fairly boring, not intuitive","My daughter and another second-grade friend both got bored of this game after 20 minutes of staring at a horse standing in a stall and listening to a cat meow. The controls are not very logical, and there is no animation to speak of."
5,Sounds Like A Nice Game... For Horse Lovers,"I have forever looked for a game where you can breed your horse. I have found ones that you can breed your horse and race them, but that was not what I was thinking. This game sounds like it rocks. And I'm sure it does. So far, I have a list of good and bad like this:GOOD THINGS:*You can breed your horses.*You take care of them and earn trust.*Your horses get sick(Amazingly, this is not a bad thing! I like it!)BAD THINGS:*To breed mares to the breeder's stallion, you have to pay a high stud fee.*The horses must have a VERY high price if you want to buy them.*Must be very hard, sounds like not many directions."
3,Daughter Loves It,My daughter loves this game. The game centers around making money and buying just the right items to keep the horse healthy as well as building a business. The instructions are as useless as the paper they are written on. The entire game is guess work. My daughter loves it and after playing it for several days she taught herself how to use it. Support for the program is non existent on the manufacturer's website. If you have trouble installing the program do not look for updates or help on the site.
3,It was ok.,"I got this game from my dad. The graphics are not very good. But on the good side you can have foals,go out for a ride,and up grade your fram. To up grade your fram you have to click on the bilding then click on the bricks and click on the house icon. To have a foal you to put your horse in the trailer and go to Trotervill AND go to the breader or buy a stallon,buy the breeding pasture put mare and stallon in breeding pature And click the breeding icon."
2,A Game in Need of Improvement,"This game is OK.It needs WAY better graphics.Breeding your horses is cool-but black horses look like they are purple!It crashes all the time and I don't believe it was worth my 30 dollars.It was fun for about a week.You can't even see equipment on your horse and the cross county compitition(The only thing you can enter)is extremely lame!I LOVE horses, but I advise not wasting your money on this game-get a better horse game-they mostly don't cost more than 20 dollars."
1,disappointed,"I got this for Christmas and love horses, but this game is too frustrating. I ended the game with horses and money and when I signed back on I was bankrupt. Nothing in the guide or on the website helped me figure out what happened. It does not have very good directions or support."
3,Fun....but disappointing,"I bought this game for my daughter for Christmas. We both love to play it, but after awhile, you get to a place where you start asking questions. At that point, prepare to be thoroughly disappointed. Not only were there NO helpful instructions, there also wasn't any sort of help file on the computer. When you first play the game, you can get a walkthrough, but if you click too fast, the walkthrough is gone and you CANNOT restart the walkthrough without reinstalling the game.Even with the walkthrough, there were still many unanswered gameplay questions. There is NO help whatsoever on the creators website.If you don't play on the computer much, and are easily amused, this will keep you happy. If you really want to master the game or play it seriously, you will encounter some level of frustration. Good luck!"
3,Fun but....,"I bought this for my equestrian loving daughter and it really is a terrific game. A little slow for today's instant gratification generation, but really interesting and good.My only complaint is it keeps crashing, so much so that my daughter will no longer play it. I have tried it on 2000/pc and xp/pc and the same thing happens."
1,Not So Good,"when i first got this game, i played it for hours and i thought it was awesome. But now, i think that this game is extremely boring. I also think that the graphics suck.They aren't very realistic and unlike other horse games, the graphics are cartoon.So I would reccomend this game for a younger kid,but for older kids, you'd be wasting your money on this game."
3,"Not bad, could be better",The game is fairly hard. I bought it for my daughter but have ended up playing it for her. I'm 23 and am struggling with it. It can also get very boring and repetitive. I've played 30 rounds and havent even been able to place in the competition.
5,realistic,"We had borrowed this from the library and I ended up purchasing our own copy. Very realistic, the kids have to take care of all aspects of their horses and learn how to run the farm. Keeping track of their money and expenses. My 8 yo enjoys it. My 5 yo has fun playing but still doesn't get the money part of it of course. I even enjoy it!"
1,I think it might be good for someone who is younger than 8.,I like the concept of the game but I REALLY don't like the graphics. If the graphics were better I would TOTALLY buy it but I'm not going to spend my horses feed on something I think is really geared toward someone under 8.This is just my opinion and as I do not actually own the game I can only base my opinion on the pictures available.
4,GREAT GAME!,"My Horse Farm is a great game. I got it for Christmas of 2005 and loved it. I am 12 and this game is remarkably hard for me to conquer! It is designed to keep you from winning, (in a positive manner!) but lets you learn about the hardships of owning a business. You need to pay inheritance tax, care for your horses and more. The graphics are cute, though not high quaility. I love them! Hope you buy it! You will not regret it!"
3,this game is sort of pointless,"it is hard and you really have to have lots of money( in the game)to go anywhere! so im 14, I reccomend this for adults and people who can get far on theese types of games, ZOO TYCOON IS THE BEST!"
4,A Very Good Game,"I bought this and I think it is a very good game but, I can not really continue the game because I lose money trying to get some by doing the 5 things. I am going to keep on trying to finish the game. If you are really good at solving games and love horse I would get this game. And anyone can try it and if you keep on trying it you can win the game."
2,could be Wayyyyyyy better.,"The graphics are clear, but they are bad! Horses look nothing like that and it is really gross! I would say get it for the younger kids, because they won't care.There is nothing to do with the game except earn money, build your hotel, and keep your horse from getting sick. You don't get to ride that often because it said ""you have ridden enough for this round"" and it is very enoying. you can't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse, but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect. But you can't do that unless you can jump the horse alot, and you can't. It is easy to go 'bankrupt' so I would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing.not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look, not for younger kids because of the money problems.So don't get this game!"
4,Simple installation and reasonable sound quality.,"The installation is simply a matter of plugging the unit in and finding a place to put the unit which is smaller than a deck of playing cards.If your car isn't very quiet, I doubt that you would be able to use the unit while you are driving. Of course the AVIC-Z1 cripples the capabilities of the unit by keeping you from using most of the features (like dialing) unless the parking brake is set. You can still dial from the keypad on your phone, but if you carry a Motorola Q, this is not an easy task sitting still."
3,Should have been standard on the AVIC-Z1,"I have the AVIC-Z1 installed couple years ago and just recently added the bluetooth adaptor. When the Z1 came out it was very expensive, I paid over 3000.00 for it including installation. For that kind of money, you think the bluetooth should be standard. Having said that, the add-on is not that expensive considering the smooth integration with the navigation unit, but there is still some echo issue though not as bad as that with the older firmware. Also, it does not transfer phonebook with a lot of phones including iPhone. I mean if my cheap Garmin 660 will download my iPhone phonebook as well as displaying battery status and signal strength on my iPhone, why can't a 2000 dollars nav unit do that?"
3,Pioneer AVIC-Z1 Bluetooth Adapter,Unit is eazy to link up and receives well. Complaints from people I am speaking to about hearing there own voice. E-Mailed pioneer about this problem with no responce.
5,This lotion smells so good!!,"I bought this lotion because a friend of mine gave me a spray that has papaya in it for bug bites!! I couldn't find the spray anywhere (she bought it in Georgia and I live in KS). Any way I read somewhere that the enzyme in papaya is very good for healing skin problems. I have terrible ezcema and I always have problems on me feet and hands and was hoping the papaya would help. It does help moisturize my sores, but doesn't work as well as the spray my friend gave me for the itch.I really do like the smell and how well this lotion moisturizes. I will continue to use it."
3,Sticky with white streaks but cleared up my skin,"CONS: The lotion does not absorb well so it causes white streaks on your skin. It also feels sticky on your skin long after you have applied it.PROS: Made with quality natural ingredients by a trusted company. My skin started clearing up after a week of use.In all, I gave this product 3 stars. It is fairly good but there are better products out there."
1,"I only paid $2.99 for this movie, but I really overpaid!","AMAZON, you must be slipping!!! How in the world could you offer this trash on your website? Poor acting skills, a pitiful drag queen, and what's with the ""pop up"" comments?Come on, y'all! Times CAN'T be so hard that you need to offer this cinematic fiasco!!! I really wish I had saved my $2.99 + shipping and handling and bought a couple of gallons of gas!PLEASE don't buy this film. The only plus of this movie is that they used good cameras. The picture quality is wonderful, but the content is horrific!Take my advice, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!"
1,Really of waste of time!,"I purchased this movie because the description sounded interesting, but this movie was hands down a huge waste of time. The dialogue and acting was bad and the only redeeming quality from the movie was the music. It was such a poorly produced film that I couldn't get past that to enjoy the moral of the story. I'm glad I only paid $2.99 for this movie. Save your money!"
3,not memorable,"I knew I bought three movies, but I couldn't remember watching three movies - until I put this one back in the DVD player. ""Oh Yeah!!, I did watch that one!"" is what I said. All I can say is Get Thee behind me. Try to find a sale price if you have to buy it."
1,Get Thee Behind Me,"I try to support African American work, so with that in mind, I jumped blindly and bought this movie. I watched the first half and thought it was awful! I see why it was so inexpensive. The singing in this movie was pre-recorded! I couldn't believe that. It was very obvious that the actors were not actually singing during the scene. I'm sure it was their voices on the recorded version, but blending it in with the movie did not enhance the movie at all. The storyline was poor; it had no real purpose. I forced myself to stomach the rest of it, trying to give it a fair chance and to see whether it would get better, and it didn't. I disliked this movie so much, I didn't even want it to remain in my house, even if it meant losing money on the deal. I highly recommend that you do NOT waste your money on this one."
1,Beware,"OMG, amazon this was a mess, only thing good on this movie is the singing and music, even though the singers are not singing themselves, this was a waste, I should have listened to other reviews, I was warned. Please don't sell this to your customers, if actors got paid they should tithed their earnings, and take the rest to get acting lessons, especially the guy girl."
1,Get Thee Behind Me,This movie was poorly done. The sound off and the talking didn't match the actors. I didn't understand the concept from the beginning.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and trying to send back.
4,OPTIONS,"Even though I'm giving author Woodson's book a four star rating, I'm not doing him a favor. My reviews usually get stepped on pretty hard by those who stand on the other side of the political fence. Okay, so this is more like a pamphlet than a book; does it really make any difference how life-saving information is delivered? No, it's not the final word on the bird flu subject, but even a redneck like myself can process the information presented. You'll learn just how quickly the flu can spread, why it's important that each person assumes some responsibility and not take it for granted that the federal government can protect us. In short, this book offers you some real and doable options."
5,a jewel,"I love this book. It's profound, right on, simple to understand ( with the heart-mind) and looks good ( nice fonts, color, cover, etc...).I will love it for a long time, and return to it regularly.It's that type of book. Feeds you good. Changes you for the better."
4,"Modulation of Equipment, Old & New","Very helpful in connecting new equipment with older large-screen TV. My household is a slow adaptation process, always in change (the only universal constant)."
5,Works GREAT!,ConnectAll 200 works great! Video is actually better using Composite Video than S-Video. Sound is great also. Highly recommend unit.
3,"works fine, power button issue.",works okay for band practice. loud enough. went it arrived the on/off switch was broken but was an easy fix. i'd recommend this for a small space and for someone that doesn't have the money to buy a better one.
1,Junk,"Do not buy this can opener, spend a few dollars more and get a nice one. After using it for 2 months it wouldn't open anything at all. Junk."
2,"Initially, a nice gift.","When I gave the pencil to my wife as a Christmas present, she was thrilled. She is an avid crossword puzzle fan. Once the lead ran out, we were unable to get the new lead in to the pen. $30 bucks out the window and what was a nice stocking gift turned in to a downer."
2,cute but that's about it,A good looking pencil but that's about it. Once the first piece of lead runs out you'll have nothing but aggravation trying to get the next piece to stay in place.Way overpriced for its performance.
3,Less interesting than the same topic written by Jacob Abbott,"In some sense, this book gives a feeling that this is a fiction rather than serious biography because there are many conversations, which clearly were made by the author.On the other hand, the author's angle is mainly limited to clothing, playing, food, precious stones, etc., rather than political issue in England and Europe.We cannot see how Elizabeth played her historical role in this book."
5,Fantastico,"Me encanta este album porque tiene varios artistas. Bueno, yo lo compre porque tengo anos buscando la cancion de la telenovela ""Como Tu Ninguna"" (protagonizada por Gabriela Spanic) y al fin la encontre! Es Ven Junto a Mi y la canta Claudio Bermudez. Se los recomiendo a todos!"
4,Sweet Little Device!,"I actually inherited this from a previous coworker that was let go for snooping in others emails. Using this switch she was able to get away with it for a long time. Anyway, I now have it, and it is a very cool gadget being I'm in IT. I like to keep this handy in case users walk in while I'm working with confidential data. It works just fine on Windows 7."
1,Garbage!!!,"This product is a piece of garbage. Do not buy it to program keys for other purposes as they claim you can. The configuration software allows you to select another key, but will not in any form allow programming these keys to the device. Consistent errors, just over all a piece of garbage."
4,Great!,We set this up to our computer and it works perfectly! Great price - it was delivered on time for our event. I would definitely recommend this to someone who is on a budget.
1,"""Lifetime"" not as long as you think","Save your receipt, because Dorman's lifetime warranty terms will most likely be of interest to you it you are keeping your truck more than a year after you install the new manifold. When you take it off to replace it again, it will either be in 2 or 3 pieces, rather than the ONE in the photo (the heavier your truck, the sooner this this unhappy day will come). The price is right in the short term, compared to the MUCH-HIGHER quality nodular-iron original GM manifold."
3,It's a lovely coffee table book. It's not a How-To book,I enjoyed reading some of the book and looking at all the pictures very much but wouldn't have bought it from a book store. The Amazon price helped me get over that. I was hoping to learn something about how to paint Trompe L'Oeil and this book was just an artists tribute to himself.
3,boards,"I think this product does the job, however, even though it states that it is a 60/60 it arrives in to halves to meet USPS regulations. So I was misled on that information until after I already received the product. Even though its suppose to be a board, it is still foamy like (example cardboard) I had bought another board else where thinking this was the same type, and the board has a vinyl covering and is much sturdier. I would not recommend this product for others to buy, your better off going to [...]"
4,Eventually resolved,"Due to problems between UPS and my apartment complex, I never received my item. However, the customer service for Home Health was effective, even via email, and did eventually issue my money back to me along with an apology for the mix-up and delay. It was just one of those instances where signals were crossed, but it was no one's fault, and I was satisfied with the attention I was given to resolve the issue."
4,At Last!,"At last a practical wildlife care book that is made for the surgery. All to often these types of books become dust collectors as there isn't sufficiant detail for the vet & vet nurses. I have found this an invaluable practical book. The detail is terrific and easy to view. No time is spent flicking through the book looking for information juggled about. The advice and index are an invaluable source to keep at hand. When time is short & may be the difference between life or death this book gets to the point. At collage we learn about cats, dogs & domestic pets and farm animals. This book should be available to all during training. All too often we have no problem finding information on the companian animals but our wildlife, which belongs to us all, sadly takes a back seat and we are left in the ands of a special bunch of people who have learned by flying by the seat of their pants. Thank you Les for another brilliant addition to my book shelf at work. A great read, and so useful too."
5,Portale is a FOOD GOD!,"Having had enormous success with Alfred Portale's previous book-""The Gotham Bar and Grill cookbook"", I couldn't wait to buy this one. 12 Seasons goes into detail about ingredients that are ""in season"" for each of the 12 months throughtout the year. Its as if every month is a ""season"" - what a delightful concept!! This book brings out the artestry in food and makes you appreciate it's beauty and flavour. The recipes in this book are easy to follow and the final outcomes have all been impressive. I have been using both of Alfred Portales books as guides and educational tools in my quest to be a greater cook - and they have helped me tremdously. I have learned so much. Unlike other famous chef's cookbooks that I have purchased - Mr. Portale seems to have taken a concerted effort to ""teach"" his readers. He helps you to realize the beauty in cooking. That's what makes him a food god."
3,Not as easy to use as advertised,"While the quality of the digital picture was excellent, I didn't think the setup buttons were all that easy to use. I bought this for my mother who is 85 and I wanted something that would be really easy for her. I ended up sending it back because even though I set up all the pictures for her on a memory card, I was worried she wouldn't be able to do what she wanted to with it. I since ordered the Pandigital frame because it had a remote control. Picture quality didn't seem quite as sharp but at least my Mom can use the remote to sift through the pictures."
2,Horrible Software and Organization,"I have owned this digital photo frame for about 2.5 years now. I have never actually had it up and running because each time I try to load pictures up, I get so unbelievably frustrated with the computer software and the frame's functionality and organization that I quit. I am trying once again to tame this beast, but it's sure putting up a fight with me again. The only reason I gave this one extra star to give a grand total of 2 is because of the ""good intentions"" and the look.I would not recommend you purchase this digital photo frame unless you have a lot of patience and stamina. It would also help if you aren't too ""anal"" about the organization of your pictures on the frame. I sure hope Philips has improved the software and functionality in their newer digital photo frames because they really were way off with this attempt...very poor."
4,great picture. picture transfer mechanism could be refined,"Great picture quality. It is highly useful to buy a frame such as this one with USB port to allow transfer of pictures from computer to frame directly. remember to buy a storage chip too, at least 256 size. The software that is needed to transfer picture is a bit cumbersome to use. One might want to wait for the next generation of the software if it will ever come out. I bought this for my mom and spent the whole Christmas assembling pictures for her. I hope she likes it!later edit: my mom did like it!!! Everyone should get one for their moms."
2,Beware if Photo Frame Does Not Work Out Of The Box,"Item could be rated 4 stars if Philips stood behind their product. Mine could not connect to my PC via the USB connector. This connection is needed for transferring pictures from the PC to the Frame. After trying to obtain help from tech support they determined it was faulty and asked me to return it. They would not pay for the shipping even though it was brand new. It costs, from Hawaii, about $40.00 to ship this product back insured. This company is not like Dell who never asks customers to ship back products under warranty at their own cost! Hooray for Dell. Thumbs down for Philips. Philips website Mission Vision states under Our Values, ""Delight customers"". I am far from delighted, but becauser this is such an expensive item, just under $300.00, I am returning it, at my cost, for replacement. Beware that if this product is faulty you will have to pay for returning it. I feel their warranty service is bad!"
4,Digital frame review,"I bought this frame for my husband for his birthday and in anticipation of our first child. He loves it so far. He is enjoying all the features and can't wait to have more photos to use with it. I recommend this item to anyone who likes photography, has children and likes electronics. The only down side is that the biggest it comes is the 8inch a bigger frame would have been better."
2,User inteface is terrible and documentation worse,"I received this as a gift, along with a memory card with pictures, and figuring out how to transfer the pictures from the memory card to the device was unnecessary painful. In the menus, there is no visual choice for returning to the previous menu, or cancelling. You have to find out how to do it by carefully reading the documentation. Don't give this to someone unless you can spend some time with them helping them figure it out."
5,nice and easy,"I bought three of these frames for an organization to give to its leaders as appreciation gifts. They are great -- easy drag & drop software, easy to set up transitions, timing, etc. With the different frames they came with, I was able to color-coordinate each frame to special scrapbooks we had made for each leader. I pre-loaded pics on each frame's hard drive and we had them already running at the presentation. They looked great, and the leaders were so pleased. I can't wait to save up the money and get one myself!"
4,Great Bright Philips Digital Picture Frame,"Nice large display, Many capabilities. Almost 5 stars, but the menus and supporting software is not overly intuitive. Great capabilities with multiple card formats supported. It did require a re-format of the card before the software and USB connection would recognize the SD card. Built in memory holds about 100 pictures with the native resolution.Display is bright from all angles. Pictures really pop!Have not taken advantage of the multiple Photo Album capability yet, another great feature though."
4,good frame,"nice modern styling, if you like that. also like the scheduled on/off feature. would like to have a longer delay between slideshow pics - 10 seconds is nice the first time, but on day 3 it would be good to slow the process down a bit so it's not always flashing new pics at you."
2,odessa,the record was in okay condition but there was supposed to be two records in the album and I only received one record (A)I actually thought I was going to receive a cd but that was not your fault. Most of my dealings with amazon are excellent.
1,Huge Disappointment,"Opening info about James Fennimore Cooper made this look like a promising travel overview, but then it was all downhill. Technically this looks like an elementary school project with dead audio space and repeated visual images. Some local businesses must have fronted funds for the production as their services have a more prominent focus. Finally, if you are looking for a good overview of baseball in this ""Home of Baseball"" video you are better off reading an encyclopedia article."
4,miniature sand building shapes,"These sand molds are great for teaching shapes. Ideally, you could use them the way you would wooden blocks: to build larger structures, such as buildings, castles, walls, etc. I think these molds require the dexterity of 4-5 year olds, because the handles are small and because removing the molds from the sand is a process that requires precision and steadiness. The molds themselves are quite diminutive, so there is little margine for physical error."
2,"It does the job, but not much more","I wanted a new and improved Astronomy program to replace Redshift 4. This program appeared to have some of the bells and whistles I previously had in Redshift 4 plus some more. While the graphics are very good in this program and telescope control support is excellent, it lacks a LOT of frills. There isn't much of a picture database, there isn't a printed manual, you can't ""fly"" around the solar system to different reference points, you can't zoom into the solar system planets for a realistic representation of what you'll see thru the telescope. I wish I would have bought Starry Night Pro Plus. It appears to be a more polished product."
2,Winning isn't everything...,"Although this book is a little outdated, the authors make a convincing case as to the spiraling salaries of Fortune 500 CEO's, sought-after-free-agent-superstar-athletes, box-office movie stars and the like. Winning begets winning, that's the gold standard of life. ""In order for top CEO's to capture their full economic value, a second factor must also be present-namely, there must be open competition for their services."" For what high level profession doesn't this rule apply? Pursuit of success is intrinsically woven into the tapestry of this nations fabric and history has always been faithful to the winner; thus, the past is a recording of HIS STORY! It's unfortunate that vanity prevents so many people from accurately assessing their talents, but I don't think it calls for the reshaping of national policy as the authors suggest."
5,theoldALFER's affair with Nanette,"My fascination (or should I say obsession?) with the Bell P-39 and the air war in New Guinea in WWII is fueled by the pages of Edward Park's ""Nannette.""Park's likening of his tour of duty as a P-39 pilot to an affair with a strumpet named Nanette is a can't put down read for any aviation buff.While short on historical details such as dates and statistics, the human drama and personal feelings of a pilot and his squadron mates come alive much as Nanette did for Parks. Life, death, and reason for being are examined through the eyes of a reluctant combatant and pilot.My favorite all time aviation book."
4,Cute story,"I have been collecting children's stories for a while now , especially fairy tales from other nationalities . This was such a lovely book. The story used small words , probably because it was translated for ESL . And even included Vietnamese translation on the pages as well. Shipping was quick and came in two days earlier will definitely buy more books from this seller!"
5,At long last available!,"The crazy SONY people kept this important recording in their archives for over 2 decades. I just don't know what's wrong with them, (they still are hidding Donizetti's Gemma di Vergy with Caballe recorded live in NY in 1976. Surely one of Caballe's best recordings). As for Mignon it's a lucky charm of an opera. This recording is excellent, with Horne in spectacular voice as the heroine, but it is perhaps that great and underrated tenor Alain Vanzo who steals the honours. He gives an exquisite performance. Von Stade is also there. Don't miss it!"
4,Great CD,This music is so relaxing and it's just what I need for recovery from some hard times. I listen to it every night!!
3,Adi - a delightful & well-played actor,"""Kuch naa kaho"": While Aishwara Rai headlines this film, young character Adi carries the film. Two other points I noticed about this film (and probably other Bollywood films): A) First, editing script & screenplay would help -because too much 'twist-n-turns' (as in a moving vehicle) can make one 'carsick.' B) Next, Feminist theory is displayed in this film (watch it you'll see), which I find quite interesting for an East Indian film. Pretty progressive, pretty cool - and so I will end here and 'say no more!'"
3,feels nice,"This is ok, comes off when I turn on my pillow. Don't notice ant change under my eyes after 1 week"
3,It's okay but won't last.,It's okay but won't last. Mine has to be held together with a rubber band after about 3 years of sparse use.Pros:Loud tick that sounds like a mechanical metronome.Cheap.Get's the job done.Cons:Low quality and won't last long.No volume control.You could get this one and buy a new one very couple of years or buy a more expensive one that will last longer. Mine will come on but I cannot change the tempo. It's stuck at 100bpm.If your kid needs a metronome and you think they might not stick with music this may be worth buying.
3,Overprice,The product itself is good. But the price is not. I can find a same product in the store for at least 25% cheaper.
3,Sounds good but battery died within one week of purchase,The metronome worked well for few days but the battery that came with it died within a week. I tried to replace it with the new battery from Dollar tree store but no luck. It still shows low battery. I need to check this out with another new battery before I can call it a junk.
1,Might as well pay a little extra for something that lasts,"I've had several piano students purchase this metronome and now I know better to tell them to buy any metronome except Qwik Time. My biggest pet peeve is that it is always set at 100 when you turn it on, and the up and down arrows take forever to get to the right setting. A dial would have been much more practical. Also, the case breaks easily! Other reviewers have mentioned the lack of volume control is also annoying. Try the Seiko SQ50-V or Yamaha QT-1."
2,Annoyingly loud.,"I just couldn't stand this metronomes click, I had to put it face down on the carpet to make it at the very least slightly bearable. The headphone jack was a stupid idea of course because you can't adjust the volume.It makes you think you can dial a number and play, but you have press those slightly responsive arrows, which is a pain considering it resets everytime you start it again. The LED really fluctuates on it's timing so it doesn't help either.The only nice thing about this metronome is that you can stand it upright...oh and battery life is long."
1,You Get What you Pay For,Unit does not keep an accurate constant beat.It varies up to +-10%.This is realy no great problem for me; because I purchsedit for walking/running exercise pace.
1,Cheap and Awful.,"The beat of this metronome is irritatingly loud, to the point where it distracts from the music you're trying to play. The LED pulse is somewhat muddy, so it's difficult to tell when it's trying to beat. There's no volume control. The headphone feature is so loud, you'll damn near blow your eardrums. There is no memory feature, so everytime you turn it on, it defaults to 100 bpm, meaning you have to readjust everytime you use it. It looks like it has a dial for bpm-adjustment (an extremely desirable feature) but it doesn't.The casing broke after only a few uses.Do not buy.For a budget metronome, I suggest you check out the Korg MA-30, or if you want the dial (and can do without a volume control) then go with the Matrix MR500 or the Seiko SQ50."
5,Great teachers aid.,"I bought this metronome to assist my students in learning the correct rate for doing CPR. It is well made, durable and really helps them keep a steady rhythm during CPR practice."
3,Going for the Gold...same 'ol same 'ol,"This book isn't bad, but if you are already a fan of Apolo's and know his story, this is just a review of it. Granted, there are great pics from the Olympics, and it's a great book for someone who doesn't know much about him."
1,the real star is steven bradbury,"I have to say that the real staris really steven bradbury. if onesaw the olympics in the 1000 meters, he was the 1 that one. i dont thinki will buy this book. he came out on thejay leno show and the conan obrian showand he said absolutely ""nothing"" aboutthe sport if it was growing. one has to actuallycheck the websites to find information aboutspeedskating, and the history of the sport.If you want some one positive in my view, Checkout Gold Medalist Derek Parra. He was enthusiasticin his interviews. and trains at the utah olympic oval.i dont recommend this book. for the most part speedskatersstay hush hush about things. it is like they just want tobe the only ones doing it.sooner or later, African Americans will dominate this sport.it is just a matter of time."
1,Poor quality,"This phone was purchased for someone who needed the speakerphone function. The speakerphone was poor quality. An even worse feature was that the microphone used during the speakerphone function was so poor that the listener could not make out many words unless the microphone itself, at the base of the phone, was held up directly in front of the speaker's face. Holding the base of the phone does not make for an easy to use speakerphone."
5,Vision: Rare and vivid,"'Labyrinth' broadens the usual approach to science by recognizing the dialogue between humanity and nature. By calling up the image of the labyrinth, Pesic reminds us that so much as science is symbolic, it symbolizes and is interconnected with the natural world. I am reminded that the scientific scope refers to the nature of those who struggle to discover Nature's laws, and who find themselves within that struggle. 'Labyrinth' reminds us of the importance of unifying ourselves with the nature we carry with us but which may not have the courage to know. If a man's vision can be said to be the great fact about him, Pesic's is surely rare and vivid."
3,Its Different,Its very different and reveals good information about the relation between science and natue
2,Philosophizing,"Too much philosophizing. Too little science. There are numerous other books that discuss the ""meaning"" of science better than this one. I was bored senseless here, to the point that I couldn't even finish the book -- and I rarely leave a book unfinished."
4,Beautiful Pictures and Ideas!,"There are many children's books inroducing the child to varous shapes: Circle, Triangle, Square, etc. This book does the same thing but extends the imagination to look for shapes in things around us. For example, if you cut a paw-paw into half you will see a ""star"" shape; a plaintain is a ""crescent"" shape; some leaves are ""heart"" shape. The photograhs in the book are rich and colorful and give you an accurate depiction of life in a Nigerian village and the things that happen in daily life as well as the things you will find around you."
5,Perfect,My son (5) and I just found this gem last week. He loves the vivid pictures and shape placement. He also loves saying the words of the many things Adaora and her cousing encounter on their search. What a fantastic way to learn about a different culture while reinforcing basic knowledge of shapes. I would recommend to all.
5,great green tea,This proved to be an excelent green tea. It is low in caffeine so having 2 or 3 cups before work doesn't leave me shaking but it certainly wakes you up. A light bitter following refreshes each swallow and leaves the tongue craving more. Perfect with honey and a touch of lemon.
1,Tastes like the dregs at a bad chinese restaurant,"weak, unpleasant flavor. Won't be ordering again. Disappointed, because we love the other varieties from two leaves and a bud."
4,Smooth with a hint of grass,"My fiancee says that Japanese tea is ""grassy,"" and that aspect certainly comes out in this tea, although it is exceptionally smooth. It's great as an iced tea with Splenda, but much lighter than your black teas."
2,Not Good Tea,"While this is decent for mass produced bagged tea, the cost is not at all justified. I've had my fair share of Japanese greens, including many Tamaryokuchas, and this is not a good Tamaryokucha.Not only is the aroma and flavor lacking (this almost tastes and smells like a bad vegetal oolong more than a Japanese green), the color is completely off. Instead of the emerald green you'd expect from a steamed Japanese green, it produces a muddy yellow color. The lush mango aftertaste you'd expect from a Tamaryokucha is almost completely missing from this tea.If you want a true Japanese tea experience, go to a local tea shop and buy some high-grade Tamaryokucha, Gyokuro, Sencha or Matcha and a cheap kyusu to brew it in. The initial cost will be higher, but you will save money over the long run brewing in this method, and the quality of your tea will be considerably better."
1,Poor excuse for Sencha!,"This does NOT taste at all like sencha -- not even a bad sencha. Instead, it tastes like a bad version of the mass produced standard green tea. If you're looking for a sencha flavor or even a good green tea flavor, avoid !"
5,The Virginian - Season 5,"A ""must buy"" for all Virginian fans. For me, season 5 is the best of a wonderful series, perhaps because it brings back such happy memories from my childhood! It's great to be able to watch the episodes again in such high-quality. I do hope they'll bring out seasons 6, 7 and 8 soon."
4,Truth and Facts,"It seems some people are getting their facts wrong about the book, only reading small sections and personally criticizing me. I welcome all opinions and reviews, based on reading the book. Read all the reviews AND my comments, then decide for yourself. Thank you!"
1,Great book...for the 90s,"Who cares about public access anymore? The days of ""Wayne & Garth"" have long passed. Although the style of writing in this book certainly has a feel for a prior era, that doesn't mean that the overall effort is worth spending money on. Besides, all of this information is available free of charge at your local cable station. As I've said, public access is dead in Los Angeles, so I can't imagine it being such an enthralling subject in the obscure places that the other ""reviewers"" on this site are allegedly from. If any of you are serious about appearing on television, develop your talent and pursue it in a professional manner...this route is strictly for amateurs."
1,"a hard read, a true shame","Enthusiasm within one's own little world never makes up for bad, inconsistent and inaccurate writing and fact reporting. Having worked at Century for several years as a Production Supervisor, I can tell you 75% of this book is merely madeup or twisted to serve the agenda of the author. The worst crime being that he took credit for starting the APLA Telethon (AIDS Project Los Angeles) at Century Cable, when in fact it was another Production Supervisor (Steve) who created, developed and produced the show, and Century Cable/Adelphia was involved with APLA long before Darby ever arrived. This book is a true shame, and a slap in the face to those who actually cared about others and helped them."
4,A VERY GOOD FAERY STORY,I ORDERED THE FIRST TWO BOOKS IN THIS TRILOGY AND I WAS HIGHLY IMPRESSED. THE STORIES WERE WELL THOUGHT OUT AND IT REALLY TRANSPORTS YOU IN TO THEIR WORLD. I LOVE THAT THE AUTHOR MADE THESE WOMEN STRONG AND NOT GODDESS GORGEOUS LIKE MOST AUTHORS DO. SHE MADE THEM LIKE REAL WOMEN AND IT WAS VERY NICE CHANGE. I HAVE READ THESE BOOKS OVER NOW ABOUT 3 TIMES AND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE THIRD ONE.
1,Very disappointing and boring,"I eagerly purchased this book, because I had found the Peter Principle to be a 'five star' delight. But, where the first book was distinguished for its wit, creativity, and originality (particularly with its being so in contrast to the 'positive thinking' approach), this one is stale and boring.Peter borrowed the same tired self-help adages that one could find in any second rate magazine, throwing in the usual advice about the 'new food pyramid' and exercise. It was as far from original as it gets, and seemed to cater to current trends and cliches rather than demonstrate the least creativity."
1,Boring...and partisan,The previous books in the Kincaid series were clever for the most part. Not this one. William Bernhardt discovered his thesauraus for this entry in the series and his soap box. Clearly William Bernhardt felt his political views needed to come through - and they do. Repeatedly. Made the book boring.
3,Capitol Murder: Thinly veiled political diatribe,"I've never gotten so far in a book and then just decided to stop reading it. That happened when I realized that: (a) I really didn't care about whether the Senator was convicted or not; (b) I'd found out who the real murderer was 3 CD's before that, and (c) I couldn't stand another political rant about how evil Republicans are and how holy Democrats are. Bernhardt slanders Nixon (easy to do, I know), and Reagan, while showering pity on poor Bill Clinton for his legal troubles, all the while telling everyone how evil the insurance and oil industries are. I could read MoveOn.org if I wanted that.Give me Tony Hillerman any day."
1,Never Again,"I bought this at a used book store for 75 cents. Unfortunately it wasn't even worth that. I couldn't even come close to finishing it. I had read Criminal Intent by this author a few years back, but evidently I didn't remember how bad it was and I thought I'd give him another chance. Never again. I thought this was supposed to be a mystery. If any author wants to continuously espouse his political beliefs (whatever they are), go ahead and publish a book of them (and see how many you sell). I read books for entertainment, not this trash. A classic case of ""Bait & Switch""."
2,Sex Over the Top,"This was a very bad book, coming from a respected author. I've liked the Kincaid books, but this one was sleazy. I really hated it. It could have been a good plot if it was not so exaggerated. Congress may be a sex cesspool, but I hope it is not this bad. Skip this book and hope someone tells Mr. Bernhardt the truth about his new trend of books. It is scary to know he is teaching classes on writing, since he uses so many cliches and we really don't need more bad authors."
3,Too Much Party Bashing,"I enjoy all of William Bernhardt's Ben Kincaid books and this was no exception. Ben always seems to have an unwinnable case but manages to pull it off, and the cast of characters adds a lot to the stories.However, I'm getting tired of hearing and reading the political agendas of celebrities and some authors as I read fiction as escapism. And the bashing that goes on in this book is so one-sided and bias that it detracts from the plot. Now that Ben is a senator, will we have more of the same in ""Capitol Threat?""If it wasn't for the distraction and party bashing, I probably would have given this book four stars."
4,"Typical day at the office: love, hate, murder and politics","Senator Todd Glancy, a notorious philanderer is on trial for allegedly killing Veronica Cooper, a member of his office staff. The evidence of their affair was publicized on national television. It is seemingly an open and shut case. Ben Kincaid, his defense attorney and his partner Christina McCall have other ideas about the case. Ben and Christina's promising albeit struggling relationship is the most appealing part of the book. Another engaging aspect was how some characters were definitely not what they seemed to be. Ben and Christina's private investigator Loving discovers what Veronica and three of her friends were up to at nights. His discoveries are closely intertwined with the trial's events. At times, the narrative was long-winded; however the main characters kept me interested until the end."
5,"Excellent, fast pasted, thriller",One of William Bernhardt's best. This one could be made into a movie.
1,Garbage!,"These films are filmed on a camcorder and try to be Blair Witch style horror but they fail miserably. The costumes are laughable. Were they using dyed cotton balls for werewolf hair?You probably saw this at collection at your local Mart for 5 bucks. These films are so terrible, they make me start to appreciate the blockbuster garbage Hollywood has put out. I don't recommend this collection at all. Echo Home Bridge Entertainment puts out some stinkers but this collection takes the cake."
4,Jane Yolen's Mother Goose Songbook,"I was first introduced to this book while student-teaching in a kindergarten classroom. We were studying poetry and Mother Goose. We had a guest speaker (Mother Goose) come visit and she brought with her this book. I was impressed with the book by not only the collection of Mother Goose rhymes, but by the traditional tunes that accompanied them. As I looked more closely at them, I realized they were the same tunes my mother sang to me when she was putting me to bed as a child. I find it priceless to have a collection of what my mother sang to me as she rocked me to sleep. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Daughter loves this,"My three year-old daughter is in love with this book. After checking it out of the library multiple times, I finally went ahead and bought a copy for her. I just read the rhymes to her (or sing them when I know the tune), but the music is included and this would probably be even more fun if you had a piano and could play the songs. I find the illustrations to be vaguely creepy, which is why I'm giving it four stars, but they don't bother my daughter."
3,Not what I expected,"If you don't balance the weight on either side of the bottom extensions, it will collapse. Not my favorite . I give it 3 stars for the middle unit. Overall not happy with it."
5,Helped me give a great presentation!,"Even though I have to give a lot of reports, I was asked to speak to a somewhat larger audience that I was used to, and I bought this book because I've really liked other books I've had by Rhonda Abrams. It helped me focus and decide on my ""core message"" and I really liked the concept of a ""building"" for organizing my key points. I found this book to be very helpful, easy to use, I liked the graphics. Because I'm already strong in PowerPoint, I didn't really need the sections on how to use PowerPoint -- although they looked like they would really be helpful to someone who was new or who wanted to add a little extra zip to their PPT slides. I also liked that the book helped me figure out what to leave out of my presentation too. And, believe it or not, it helped me improve my presentation in much less than a day -- the time the title promised."
3,"Good ilustrations and photos, so so information.","The good:- Covers a time gap that most books neglects.- Color illustrations are very good and along with the photos show various schemes and in some cases schemes from various users.- The presentation is good and illustrative. It won't bore you with excessive text.The bad:- As is typical of this series of books the information is far from extensive and sometimes suspicious. I'm pretty sure of sometimes it's inaccurate.- The book is far from extensive. Many aircraft are nowhere to be found (Strikemaster, Vampire, Seasprite, Mi-2, Mi-4 to name a few). If you want an encyclopedia this is not it.Bottom line: Fun to read and look at. Not a trusty reference.Note: I also own ""Modern Military Aircraft (The Aviation Factfile)""."
3,"Good for terminology, but no substitute for experience","As an IT professional who needed to master many facets of foreign exchange rather quickly, I found this book to be helpful in gaining an ear for the terminology and basic concepts, as well as basic jargon of traders. This book might be best used as a companion to a course on the same subject, as it might give you an alternate explanation of the same subjects."
2,pink plastic,There is no orange it is mostly pink and all plastic. The stand and base are good quality as is the electrical portion however the shade is cheap. It is also horribly packed with styrafoam that breakes apart into a million pieces when you touch it.
4,Very moving! He could be the next Billy Joel,"I have only listened to ""all the waters in this world"", a beatiful, perfectly arranged piano ballad with touches of rock and a female singer as chorus, that reminded me of some of Billy Joel's work, except that his voice is, well, different.If the rest of his album is like the song ""All the Waters of this world"", Aaron could very well be the next Billy Joel!. I purchased Aaron's singles online as DRM-free downloads in OGG format and lossless FLAC files thru the ""Mindawn dot com"" music subscription service."
4,1911 Wrap-around rubber grips,You cannot beat Pachmayr for affordability. They fit about 97% right out of the package so I had to trim them a little to fit 99%. They are stable while in use and I get what I wanted out of a checkered grip.
2,won't fit my Kimber custom 2,"love pacmyer, bought these for a Kimber 1911 custom 2 and the don't wrap all the way around. I wouldn't suggest for a Kimber"
3,"Overall witty, funny but very slow in some spots.","This is nowhere close to the quality of ""Lake Wobegon Days"" but worth a read, nevertheless. While it is very witty and clever in many places, at other times it really drags and often becomes so silly as to be unbelievable even as the fantasized life of Jimmy ""Big Boy"" Valente. I think Mr. Keillor rushed this one to the publisher when it could have used some polish and revision."
3,"Not Keillor's best, but a humorous diversion.","Readers who try to judge this book with a partisan mindset will miss the point of the book entirely, and so would do well to not buy it. Others will find it a hoot, because what Keillor is satirizing is not so much one individual (as colorful as he may be) as the American political process, which has become the world's best example of performance art.For my money, this book was worth it just for Jimmy Valente's reference to the current Supreme Court Justice as ""Bill ('The Robe') Rehnquist."""
5,Me: by Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,I've read most of Harrison Keillor's book and rate this as one of his most hilarious as litterally from the first page to the last I was in tears with laughter! A great read!
1,Simply Awful,If I could give this awful piece of typewriting zero stars I would. Probably the worst thing I have read in years.
1,Raining on the Parade,"Keillor always thought if anyone from the entertainment world would be elected ""King"" of Minnesota, it would be him. And then he was beaten to the punch, shown up, supplanted and body slammed by of all people, an uneducated, loud, ex-TV wrassler! The result was this obnoxious little temper tantrum of a book.Rumor has it that Keillor will marry the sound of his own voice in a private civil ceremony. Music will be provided by Keillor, as well as all readings, officiating, and other auditory sounds. Keillor's ego will serve as best man. Keillor and his melodious vocal chords will then honeymoon at a slightly above-average Kareoke bar in Hawaii."
2,Disappointing.,"I expected better. Keillor comes off unnecessarily condescending and offensive. He has tarnished Minnesota's reputation for ""Minnesota nice."" I'm glad I checked this one out of the library and didn't spend any money on it."
1,Dull and spiteful,"This is simply Ms Keillor's high-handed, more-intellectual-than-thou attack on ""The Body"". If half as many people supported NPR as watched professional wrestling then maybe our Government wouldn't have to waste our tax dollars on Ms Keillor."
4,Fun Album,"This is really a very fun album. Seems it is out of print, so your only choice is to buy a used CD. I have hundred of CD's and I highly recommend this one. It will make your Christmas more enjoyable."
3,angie aparo,"I bought this old Christmas CD for one reason only: Angie Aparo. There are several other songs I also like on the CD, and it never occurred to me to go find the song on iTunes if I could. But that's okay, this CD showed up in perfect (used) condition in a timely manner and that was great."
3,An interesting new idea - but repeated over and over,"The premise of this work provides a very interesting and easily recallable way of thinking of IT resources - a pyramid structure the breaks down IT into 4 major areas. The only problem is that the idea is repeated ad nauseum. There are a few interesting case studies, but the 'core ideas' could have been stated in about 1/3 the pages."
4,Thorough Survey,"I found this book quite helpful for my team. It covers the current issues quickly and well. Although it is repetitive, the book presents a tapestry that steers thinking in IT toward strategic alignment. The book lays the foundation for the holistic integration of IT and business strategy, using techniques (though not explicitly) of portfolio management, continuous improvement, teambuilding, and enterprise architecture modeling.I highly recommend this book. It should be paired with a more enterprise architecture centric book to provide a complete actionable background. That said, the book stands alone to plant the foundation for successful IT/Strategy convergence."
2,For hardcore Zappa fans ONLY,"Man, I'm a pretty big Zappa fan, but this isn't the easiest movie to sit through. If you've seen 200 Motels, you have a basic idea of what to expect from Zappa the film-maker. However, while 200 Motels was bizarre, Uncle Meat is just plain inane. The movie follows no direction at all. Scenes of people talking about unrelated things are just stitched together to make the movie. The one thing that makes the movie worth seeing is the performance of the concert that appears on the ""Ahead Of Their Time"" CD. Even that isn't really enough to encourage anyone to pay anything over [dollar amount] for the movie. [...]"
5,Great Book - get it if you can find it,"This is a great book - wonderful patterns; I've probably made the ""Lucky"" as a baby gift a dozen times.Recommended yarns can be switched out successfully."
3,This is not live!!!,"It is a typical record where they just add a crowd and applause track to each song making one think that it is a live peformance. I really hate that. I was about to buy the Show of Frankie Ruiz but good thing I heard this because it has to be the same thing. If you are buying this Cd thinking it is a live performance, you are getting robbed."
2,Amatuer writing for amatuer DJ's,"I'd been djing for about a month when i got this book, and was extremely dissapointed with it. There was not much in this book that i hadn't found before in various web sites around the web. The style of the book is dissapointing, and I felt that i was perhaps not the audience Chuck was writing for, yet i got it to find out how to get a break in the dj business. Two reasons for buying this book could be: a) you want to know the very beginnings of djing, b) you need to teach your girlfriend/friends the basics so they understand what YOU do."
5,Outstanding,"I originally purchased this book under the presumption that it would some nice lite reading to add to my knowledge about Roman society only to be delightfully surprised that this was an indepth, accurate and insightful look into not only the world of the gladiator, but of all public preformers of Rome"
3,For someone that doesn't know about gladiators,"For me, coming from re-enacting Roman gladiators, I did not find this very informative. I guess I was expecting more out of the book but not really sure what to expect. It came very highly recommanded.I didn't find it very helpful because I knew the classes of gladiators, what type of armor they wore, who they paired against, the lifestyle they lead, etc....The only thing that really impressed me were the pictures of gladiator artifacts, and modern Roman gladiators in there gear!For someone that doesn't know anything or only a little I would recommend this book."
5,FR. KAPAUN WAS OUR REGT. CHAPLIN,"I WAS WITH CO.C IST BN. 8TH CAV. REGT IN KOREA. I HAVE BEEN A CATHOLIC FOR 48 YEARS, AND CREDIT FR. KAPAUN EQUALLY INSTRAMENTAL IN GUIDIND ME TOWARD THE FAITH, HIS LACK OF FEAR IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE, WHEN HE AND OTHER CHAPLIN WOULD GO TO THE AID OF THE WOUNDED AND DYING MADE YOU FEEL THAT HE COULD NOT BE HARMED. I STARTED PRAYING TO FR.KAPAUN SOME MONTHS AGO ,NOT KNOWING THAT HE COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR SAINTHOOD,BECAUSE I FEEL I HAVE SOMEONEIN HEAVEN WHO UNDERSTANDS MY FEELINGS OF SURVIVING GUILT AND WILL ASK FORGIVNESS FOR ME. SINCERLY DONALD H. SUMMERS 301 WILDHORSE COVE CLEVELAND GA. 30528"
5,Great Christmas Present,My Dad went to the High School that was named after this Priest. He loves it so far.
1,Terrible - do not waste your money,"This collection of so called videos is nothing more than cut outs moving across the screen. Terrible, do not waste your money."
4,Very Good Purchase for the Money......,"So much fun watching these old movies. I'm very happy with this purchase. Some of the first movies I viewed had poor sound quality, but I could still understand what was being said. Also, I didn't notice a logo being played as someone had mentioned. Both sides play perfectly. I would definately recommend buying this movie pack if you love these type movies. (meant to give 5 star rating, gave 4 by mistake)"
2,Worthless,"A waste of time and money, a poorly done set of very dubious value and little or no entertainment, not worth a quarter of what I paid for it, but any price would be too much."
2,Mr. L Mapes,"I was very disappointed in this product, as the recordings were the worst I've ever seen. I could have done a better job of recording these for re-sale. With all the Computor knowledge that we have today, it's a shame that a product of this quality would be sold. Amazon, you messed up good this time."
4,Dark Crimes Collection: 50 Movie Pack,"Picture quality varies from Poor to Good. Cost? 50 DVDs for less than $15. Expect some flaws. None are remastered. This is one of the best 50 Movie Pack collections. Have not seen them all but the few I have seen are great as far as story lines go. If you like black and white movies of a bygone era, buy this. Don't expect fine wine at the cost of a glass of beer. Enjoy."
3,"Good stuff, but trouble on the B side","Hard to not get your money's worth here, but I have found eight of the 12 B sides produce an error message and won't play, at least on my DVD player. Has anyone else had the same problem? That being said, this set is packed with good films--Inner Sanctum, The Hoodlum, Half a Sinner, The Great Flamarion, to name a few--that I had never heard of before but enjoyed immensely. So many good ones, I wonder what I'm missing on those B sides."
2,Selection is fine BUT no closed captioned,"My husband loves old movies but he is hard of hearing and can only enjoy a movie with closed captions. I bought this set because it said that it was close captioned but it is NOT!The selection looked good, but we are returning the set because of this issue."
3,subtitle,A strange request: have this set the english subtitles? I'm italian and so I prefer to have the subtitles for better understand the movies.ThanksFausto
5,A perfect beauty... and a wound,"Heart- and soul breaking. This book has a very symbolic meaning for me. It is one of the first books I had ever read in French, also the book that once brought me and my former fiance together. (To make the melodrama complete, I am a Bosnian refugee who has lived many years in Germany, so the part about love, war and German relationships applies as well, tiens)."
4,GOOD,"GOOD WORK ALTHOUGH I EXPECTED MORE SONGS. EXCEPT FOR INFIDELIDAD, I LOVE ALL THE OTHER SONGS. ONE OF HIS GREAT WORKS."
5,Oceanic Salt from PetSolutions,The price for the amount can't be beat. The salt arrived very quickly and without any problems what so ever. PetSolutions even sent me a product magazine which is great. I would definitely buy from them again.
3,Not sure if it's great,Seems like i've been having more trouble with algae; will probably go back to reef crystals or something else. But could be my imagination.
5,Excellent Salt for the Money,Excellent salt for a saltwater reef aquarium and you can't beat the price. It dissolves almost instantly and has some of the best levels of minerals for the reef inhabitants on the market. My pH is a consistent 8.0 and I've never had any nitrate or algae problems since using it.
1,Kindle reader useless for this title,"This is not a complaint about the book as such, but about the Kindle edition. Unlike an Acrobat file, when you change the size of the text to read more easily (on the Windows Kindle reader), the images and more importantly, the non inline equations, stay the same tiny size. So, it is useless to try to read this book on a laptop; the equations are just too tiny."
5,Get it.,"I never thought I'd see 'Cliffs Notes' for Thermodynamics, but here it is.You get the gist of it in just about two hundred partial differential equations.It's like water falling off a ducks back."
5,Outline of Thermodynamics,"Old things forgotten are better reviewed. Why study this after retirement? Prevent brain rot, brain decay. Excellent guide goes along w/ other Amazon.com texts."
3,Kindle version review,"In despite of the book quality, the Kindle version shows the usual problems I've found in all scientific texts for the ereader: poor quality of equations and figures.Equations are often too small to read or even go beyond the screen size, not being fully displayed."
5,Use it almost every day,"It took a little time to get used to using this pressure cooker because my mother made sure to scare the dickens out of me when I was little. Now this is required in my kitchen almost daily since my husband is from India. We used to have all aluminum pressure cookers but I've been worried about aluminum getting in our food so when the old one needed replacing about a year ago I got this one. Sometimes if the lid isn't on exactly right a little steam will leak from the seal (aluminum cookers didn't have this problem) so I reposition the lid and it usually works the second time. It's great for cooking any kind of beans, rice, vegetables, chicken etc. that you would usually have to boil. One or two whistles for most veggies and chicken, twenty minutes or so for beans and dal (lentils). Much faster than boiling!"
5,Awesome product,It saved me the headache of carting this heavy product from India!! The product works very very effectively. Highly recommended
5,"Wonderful pressure cooker, a must have",I use this pressure cooker and it is the best I ever have. It is very effective and easy to clean. It fits well with my 2 persons' home.
4,Learning Curve,"It's going to take some time.I bought this pressure cooker to make better rice. My first batch wasn't all that great. In fact, it was mush! Way over-cooked. Where cooking on an open pot takes 20 minutes or so, I cooked the rice for only 8 minutes and then let it naturally de-pressurize for another 10. (even then, I had to release the pressure) It came out like way-over-cooked spagetti.The fault isn't in the cooker. It's working exactly as advertised. The size I chose is perfect for my purposes. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't have a glass top. I think a glass top would be a neat feature to avoid over-cooking.So I'll keep trying different cooking / cool-down times to see if I can get better.Ken"
1,it was a defective product and i have applied for refund,"I have purchased hundreds of things from amazon but for the first time this pressure cooker turned out to be defective.The lid is leaking and the device does not develop pressure.it was completely worthless.We have applied for refund and we are thinking of buying a different pressure cooker.I thought Hawkins was a reputable name however they proved us wrong ,by selling defective pieces online.From now on I will double check ,anything i buy from Hawkins.."
1,Pressure cooker,"This is an extremely unsatisfactory and dangerous product. The one I purchased was returned and my account was promptly credited by those great folks at Amazon. This cooker spews scalding food and steam on your cooktop, kitchen walls, and the chef despite following directions explicitly. Beware, do not purchase."
2,Title should be: Authentic Art Deco Desings in Full Color,"This book is nice to have for the low price however, it was not what I had expected. The book contained only the illustrations of the designers' concepts for the rooms. It would have been better if it had included photographs of the rooms or any information about the designs or designers."
5,GREAT!,"I havent read this book yet but, being a student of Mrs.Boligers 9th grade Literature class I am sure that it is a great book. For all you ppl who are alwayz HATEING on her for the things she writes about of the things she says in her newspaper column, you need to get to know her before you critize her, even when you meet her that does not give you the right to put her down.!!!!Mrs.Bolinger you are a great teacher never give up!!!!"
2,Hard to read,This was a replacement one that I had for 8 years - and finally bleached out. This particular one is very hard to read and it doesn't line up right.
1,temperature is way off,"It says the water in my pool is 78 degrees. That is not even possible for where we live. The outside temperature hasn't been over 85 for almost 2 weeks and it has rained and rained. Before my old pool thermometer (and I should have bought the same thing-stupid me) broke, the last few readings were in the low to mid 50's.This is going back. what a waste of time."
4,Plays all well,I can rec this for its ability to play just about anything. I do not like the cheap and very slow input drawer. I think this unit is a little over priced. The extra book they include is nothing less than outstanding. Wish other mfg's would include things like this.
