1,I was deceived!!,I also bought this because it was listed under Karaoke. I am returning it and will make a complaint to the webmaster.
1,Another one that's just a cd,I bought this because it was advertised under Karaoke..it's just a CD. This is the second time this has happened. Someone should correct this mistake...it's happening too much. The songs are good but I wanted it for Karaoke!!!!!
1,Not as advertised,"I put this in my Karaoke machine and there are no words. It's not in the right category. This is advertised under Karaoke and it is just a CD!!!! The songs are good but I didnt' buy it for that, I bought it for singing Karaoke!!!! My daughter ad I are very disapointed."
4,Zildjian drummer gloves,"Really nice gloves. However, the extra pad on the right thumb is NOT on the left thumb. A mysterious oversight in design or a defect, I am not sure. The gloves should have extra padding on both gloves, not just one. Drumming is an ambidextrous activity after all.NOTE: I emailed Zildjian, and they are taking care of the issue - wonderful personal service from Zildjian. Thank you!"
1,Cheated,"Because THE person who sell me THE book, was cheated on my, this book was used and supposedly it was new! Never buy books with that person!"
5,lovely,"It reminds me in some ways of the Robert Frost poems the one about the two roads, except in Rebecca's case she was given a chance to taste what her life could have been like if she married David instead of Julian. When Julian came back it seemed to be the end of the type of life she had always craved for.The story is heart breaking in some part, as Rebecca and David were placed in a situation which they could not escape from because they were not ruthless enough to place their own happiness infront of others. The use of circumstances was wonderful and Balogh was incredibly consistent throughout the whole story."
1,Mary Balogh at her worst,"This is the worst historical romance I have ever read. The hero David is a pushover always taking the blame for his foster brother, and never standing up for himself. The heroin Rebecca is cold and heartless. And the ending is sad."
3,Book description,"Her beautiful eyes flashing with hate, Rebecca faced Lord David Tavistock. He had come back, wounded but still vibrantly, sensually alive, from the Crimean War. Julian Cardwell, her sweet, gentle bridegroom-and David's foster brother-had not. She blamed wild, reckless David for Julian's decision to enter the Queen's Guards, and for the devastating loss of her perfect young husband, whose memory even now broke her heart and filled her dreams.His blue eyes shadowed by dark secrets, David had come to claim the woman he had always loved. All his life he had protected the charming Julian, hiding the truth from Rebecca about the women Julian dallied with, the child he had fathered, the scandalous way he died. Now David offered Rebecca a life of privilege and wealth-as his wife. She wanted a marriage of convenience, but he intended to awake her deepest passions, to make her forget Julian Cardwell...and to find in his bed all the ecstasy of a man's true love."
1,depressing ending and implausible,"I like Balogh's recent books a lot, but this older one is a real downer. The ending is depressing, and it is impossible to believe the hero and heroine can justify to themselves what happens to allow them to be together."
3,Tangled Love Triangle,"3.5 stars. This has a similar sad, poignant tone as other of Balogh's works of this time. Many might find it depressing, it is definitely not a lighthearted read. The characters are tormented as with other of Balogh's books of this tone. The writing is good with often beautiful prose. One of the few historical romance I've read where the heroine is predominantly submissive with no defiance (except for one thing). This goes against most of todays historical novel's independent/fiery heroine.Although I like novels with emotional depth with tormented characters like these, this one didn't move me as much as others of Balogh's works (Balogh's The Secret Pearl being one of my favourites of hers of this tone)."
4,Review of sweatshirts,The materail was a little thin but the size I requested fits well and has held up well after several washes.
3,"For crying out loud, it's a hoodie.","I'm not quite sure what can be said about this hoodie other than the fact that somehow a unisex 3X adult size still was small enough for people to think that I was wearing my wife's clothes.Okay, so the hoodie is pink. But I like pink.Still, the fabric is not thick and the sizing runs small. If you're overweight like I am, this hoodie will leave nothing to the imagination."
4,Enquiry,I would like to order 5 jackets: 4 youth size and 1 adult size. Can someone please let me know if this is as option?
4,Sweet,"Objectively speaking this movie doesn't cover new ground. Rebel youth gets sent away to relatives in a 'healthy' environment(this time the countryside) to learn responsibility.However.. The way the movie tells its story is incredibly moving.Likable yet spunky characters, some fine acting and beautiful photography bring Firefly Dreams' world alive and within minutes you're drawn into the story.Sometimes the old stories just work. I mean if it ain't broke why fix it?This film is a great example of this. Recommended to fans of fine (coming of age) drama."
5,"Excelent all around. Music, lyrics, emotion, feature singers. A most have in ur collection.","Romantic, beautifully created."
1,Huge let down,I looove Alejandro but I'm so sorry to say that this CD is a huge let down. Donde estas Alejandro? que en este CD no te encuentro.
4,Spanish Music,"I heard some of Alejandro's music on the soundtrack for a movie. It was beautiful, so I looked for his albums and chose this one. It is really wonderful. While I am not fluent in Spanish, it doesn't make any difference, the music is so captivating."
5,Love Him - Amazing!!,"I love this CD - his voice sounds better than ever. The music and lyrics are so mature and unique and did I mention the voice? Alejandro makes studying Spanish fun. My favourite song is A La Primera Persona - it's so addictive I can have it on repeat for hours! I'm working on translating his songs into English so if you want to see, please visit my site alejandrosanz4englishspeakers. I can't wait for his English album - hope he sounds as good in English as he does in Spanish!"
2,Disappointing...,"Let me start off by saying that I love Alejandro Sanz' music. His last album, No Es Lo Mismo, is still heavily played on my ipod. When I first heard the first track off of this new album, ""A La Primera Persona"", I was amazed at the passion behind the lyrics and the beautiful score that accompanied them.So on its first day of release, I went off to buy his brand new album, El Tren de Los Momentos. How dissapointing!The few highlights off this album ""A la Primera Persona"", ""En la Planta de Tus Pies"", and ""Te Quiero y Te Temo"" do not warrant the purchase of this album. I should have just downloaded ""A la Primera Persona"" which was the reason for my buying this album. The rest of the album is full of uninspired songs (including his collaboration with Shakira ""Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No"")and awkward, fast paced rapping (""Se Molestan"", ""El Tren de los Momentos"")"
5,New fan,"I have to be honest, im not a huge Alejandro Sanz fan but his Colaboration with shakira interested me in his music, i bought his mtv unplugged cd and its just pure raw beauty, and such honesty in his voice..and yes music can be honest. I bought this as soon as it came out, since i knew shakira was a guest on one of the songs (Te lo agradezco pero no) I have to say i fell in love with it within the first listen. There's just this chill, feel good vibe throughout the whole album.. I love them all, not perfect but its such a good feel good cd! i give the singer/songwriter props !"
3,Decepcionante en verdad.,"Esperaba mucho más del nuevo disco del maestro. Qué le habrá pasado? Las canciones más rescatables son ""Enseñame tus manos"", ""Se lo dices Tú"" que es preciosa, y la misma ""A la Primera Persona"".Las demás están soportables y OK para escuchar pero no son la revelación que esperaba de Alejandro.La última canción, ""El Tren de los Momentos"" está verdaderamente horrenda. No la he escuchado entera ni una sóla vez.Las 3 estrellas se las gana sólo por ser quien es y porque es indudable la presencia de músicos talentosos en el disco.Si es tu primer disco de Alejandro Sanz mejor comprá uno anterior.Alejandro dijo que para este disco no escrbió una sola palabra y la verdad, se nota, no hay ni una linea citable en todo el disco."
4,"""El Maestro Sanz""","Alejandro Sanz is still the greatest composer in Spanish music today. This artist's music has definitely evolved throughout the years and in this latest compilation, Alejandro has expanded his music genres and attempted to mix several rhythms creating various styles of music. The simple ballads he once composed are no longer found; however, there are still some that remind you of his stylized thought provoking ballads. There are several songs Sanz decided to experiment with, which some people who loved his music may not enjoy; however if you are a true Alejandro sanz fan you can appreciate his genius in developing his music and lyrics. There are some very powerful songs and the lyrics are genius; however others are a little too experimental for my tastes. I recommend this compilation, probably not one of my favorite CD's from him but if you are still wondering about getting this CD, maybe just download a couple of his songs."
5,Love bioplast,I've used bioplast nose rings and nipple rings and I love them. So light and comfy!! I highly recommend bioplast body jewelry.
5,A must have for any Type XXI model,"I bought this book to help with a cut away model of a Type XXI that I am currently building. I only have one other of the ""Anatomy of the Ship"" series: ""Type VII U-Boat"" so I didn't have any expectations of the book format. Although it may differ from their normal layout, it has everything I need. And a lot more.To help with the layout and accuracy, I find this book indispensable. The photos and drawings are excellent, especially helpful since the instructions with the model (Revell #05078) are a little off.I have built five other sub models and have 16 other books on submarines: primarily U-boats. I feel that the ""Type XXI U-Boat"" was a necessary addition to my collection. Well worth the money. Glad I bought it."
2,another preview,I'm just going to be very careful while browsing. THis TV show can be seen on many TVs and Netflicks...my mistake.
1,Just an Advertisement,This is nothing more than an advertisement for flu shots directed at children. You get what you pay for on this one!
1,You get what you pay for!,"Sid the Science KidIf I could give this less than 1 star I would! Never completely downloaded to my device. It got 9 minutes into the download then said ""download paused"". I clicked options and selected ""Make active download"", but nothing happened. I've also selected ""cancel download"" and still nothing! I am able to stream it, but that is useless to me as I wanted to download it so that my son can watch it on long car rides. There isn't even an option to delete it from my library, so now I'm stuck with it! SO glad this was free, now I know not to waste money on other titles!"
1,"Daughter hated it, Pharmaceutical propaganda","I bought this based on positive reviews.Pros: Somewhat cute and bouncy animation.Cons: #1 My daughter had zero interest in it, I also found it very boring. #2 It's basically just a pharmaceutical advertisement, which I find extremely offensive. The fact that they are targeting parents and children is horrifying.Stick to Seasame Street and Yo Gabba, and Pixar."
1,Just a promo for shots,All about getting the flu vaccine... says its the only way to protect from germs and be healthy. No mention of side effects or ineffectiveness. haha. FAIL!
5,Sid the Science Kid,delightful cartoon for young children. Very well animated for adults to enjoy also. Good educational lesson for kids. Lively entertainment.
4,whats not to like,it was a free video on prime and if you have little ones this is an entertaining show. catchy music and always some kind of lesson
1,A bit boring,"The animation was odd. The movements of the characters was weird. It is public television type material, and you'll pick that up as soon as the first note plays on the shows intro. But, none of that really matters when it was being played for a kid. So, what did the kid think? That it was boring. Had to turn it off after only 2 minutes cause my kid kept trying to turn off the TV just to stop the apparent torture I was putting him through by watching this show! For us, this show stunk. For you, it might work... if what your looking for is a sleep aid."
5,We Love Sid,I downloaded this as our fist video download to our recently purchased Kindle Fire. My daughter loves being able to sit anywhere and watch this episode of our favorite little Science Kid.
3,Meh,"Even though I vaccinate my kids, felt like there was serious agenda behind this cartoon. It was just alright I guess"
5,Great Show!,My son is one years old and he loves this show and thank goodness his father and me love it too!
4,Shopping for elf ears is tough,"My daughter wanted to be an elf for Halloween, after much shopping these were the ears she selected. They worked well, stayed on and were not too uncomfortable for the princess."
2,elf ears,"The elf ears were realistic, but there was no way to keep them on, I ended up putting earring thru them to help hold them on. Even then sometimes the tops would start to slip off. They weren't that big but nothing to hold them. If you have suggestions for that I would like to hear about them. Did get lots of comments about them, but it made the ears sore from pulling on the earrings."
4,elf ears,"they were good overall, although a little bigger than I expected. They don't give a ""lord of the rings"" look (a slightly pointed ear-look) but are much bigger and obvious looking."
3,Elf ears,"These ears were awesome for my son's elf costume. They look great and were great quality, however they were impossible to stay on. Couldn't put them on my 5 year olds ears or my ears. We only needed them for pictures so I bought double sided tape and taped them on to him and it worked great. If this product was going to be used for a costume party where they would need to be worn all night, there might be a problem"
3,A little what I expected,"It is a little difficult to keep them from falling off. Once I get over that difficulty, they are pretty comfortable and looks great."
1,Does not fit a human ear; dont waste your money.,"The item came promptly and was packaged typically.Once opened I tried them on and they would not stay on.Since I am a grown man I figured maybe they would fit a kid/tween and so I tried them out on my niece and nephew, ages 12 and 15.The same problem occurred with them; the ears are not ergonomically designed to fit on a human ear.Looking at it, it MIGHT fit on a small child's ear, perhaps 8 or younger could fit inside the opening.This ""one size"" does not fit all.I gave it two stars because the shipping was prompt and the Amazon return process was easy.Purchase price: Eight Dollars and ten cents.Shipping: Four Dollars and eighty four cents."
3,For daughter's costume,"My daughter was an elf for Halloween so these filled the bill. You will need some sort of adhesive since they don't stay on by themselves very well. Other than that, they worked fine."
2,Elf Ears Purchase,"Very good purchase, not expensive, they are a good size and stay on your ears. Worked great for a Christmas Elf, just a few weeks ago!"
3,"entertaining, yes; informative, not really","This book is actually like a series of jokes about the protypical disinterested, stupid male and he how he survive his wife's pregnancy by feigning interest. In one passage about dealing with your wife's changing body, the author lists ""Avoid fat jokes."" C'mon, are we so stupid that we need to read that?I would suggest readers check out Armin Brott's, The Expectant Father, instead. It is also entertaining, but aimed more at the serious father, and it provides useful information."
1,Insulting!!!,"HORRID! DO NOT BUY! We would return it...had we not only spent $0.59 on it in the first place. This terrible book treats men like rude, purely self-centered, uninterested idiots. It talks to fathers-to-be as if they are going to be put out and annoyed by the entire pregnancy experience. This book tries to be funny, but instead falls way short, ending up being flat out disrespectful."
2,"Not very informative, maybe humorous, maybe.","This book contains little information for the expectant father, that isn't already known or common sense. The author wants you to think this book, by a guy, is all guys need to know about the birthing process, but it seems like this book was written more to appease women, under the disguise of a guy's book. If you want a book that let's your wife think your interested, but contains little useful information and is easy to read, then this is it."
1,Not A Worthwhile Read,"This entire book can be summarized with this sentence: ""Be nice and respectful to your wife.""There is virtually no content in this book for men trying to understand more about what is going on with regard to pregnancy, but rather its entire intent is to placate wives into thinking we have read and understand more. The opening chapter even acknowledges this.Also, this book has some outdated information in it. In 1997 when the author was writing his first version, renting a pager from a hospital was probably worth mentioning. With 2012 around the corner and with the ubiquitousness of modern cell phones, this chapter should have been deleted from the 2008 printed version.Even though this book takes no time to read, it is not worth the effort. Look somewhere else if you want to actually learn something."
5,Hurricane - Rockin' Better Than Before,"If you remember this band from the early '90s, you may remember ""I'm On To You...na, na, na, na, na, na"". No, not Journey, but lead singer, Kelly Hansen, does 2 Journey tribute songs on a new Tribute CD. Singer, Kelly Hansen, and drummer, Jay Schellen, are the only two members from the original band of the '90s. Kelly Hansen's vocals are stronger and the songs are not glamourous like hard rock became in the early '90s. A Warr Guitar is used on one song. Just an example of the band becoming more sophisticated. If you like this medlodic hard rock with a new twist (not Alternative), pick this up.Kelly Hansen has done tribute songs for Journey, VH, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and the Scorpions. He also got together with Tim Donohue, who uses a Harp Guitar and Fretless Guitar. And he sang with Joe Lynn Turner on Stuart Smith's CD (Ritchie Blackmore influenced)."
3,Nothing Special,"This CD is just ok. It is by far the weakest of all of Hurricane's releases. A previous reviewer said it was their most ""cohesive"" record. I guess that means all of the songs stick together (which makes sense since they all sound pretty similar). There doesn't seem to be a standout song that makes me want to listen to it again. I hate to write a somewhat negative review, but as a big fan of this band I was disappointed in this record. It is simply a collection of some decent songs with Kelly Hansen's excellent vocals. If you're a Hurricane fan and/or completist then get this CD, but don't overpay for it."
4,simple and easy,Great Camera for the price. It's simple and compact which makes it easy to point and shoot. I would have given it five stars but it came without battery. Overall very satisfied.
3,Almost everything we wanted.,"When we went shopping for a camera to replace our current one, this is the one that we came across. My brother even has the same camera and he loves it. We did research and found that it had everything that we needed until upon receiving the camera, we found that it doesn't have the date caption that we thought that it did. There are two different models of this camera, one says caption and one doesn't. We had seen the one with caption at many other stores and didn't realize that there was a model without a caption.It is a great camera, unless the date caption is an important feature for your family."
2,Flash is off,"I recieved this camera as a gift and while it worked alright for outside pitcures, in many of the indoor pictures, the flash caused the lighting to be drastically uneven."
1,To Love Again NOT A DUAL DISC,I just purchased and listeded to this CD. I was under the impression that it was a dual disc with both CD music and DVD music. WRONG - its a CD only. I likely would not have bought this if I woulda known it was not a Dual Disc with DVD stuff. Well Botti is good and there were 7 tracks that I liked and I moved the others to a NG folder.
1,dualdisc too hard to listen to.,so far I haven't been able to find a cd player that it will play on with the dualdisc. If you want to play cds this is not type you want to use.
3,"Chris Botti is ""Dave Sanborn+Rick Braun""","I now own three (3)Chris Botti CDs: When I Fall in Love; To Fall in Love and Midnight Without you.I will say this: No, Chris Botti is neither Miles Davis nor Wynton Marsalis! He is neither of their stature nor in their class. And, he knows this!The truth is that when his fans compare Chris to these true Jazz Greats, it becomes way too easy to dismiss Chris as a young and much less talented ""wanna be!"" Thus, these comparisons are fundamentally unfair to Chris. So, stop the madness!The real truth is that Chris Botti is a wonderful musician in his own right, in his own class, and he has his own style.His choices of vocalists are wonderful! Sting and Jill Scott and Paula Coles just seem to belong on his CDs!I appreciate Chris and enjoy what he is now contributing to the field of 21st Century Music!"
2,mixed,Product arrived quickly but the case was broken in half. Luckily Disk was not damaged too badly so I was able to swap out cases and it still played.
4,Lush but not hot,"A very beautifully conceived, lush album. But if you'relooking for trumpet pyrotechnics and zing,forget about it.This will lower your blood pressure and lull you into a coma.I recommend you listen to it with your partner over candlelight and some wine, but not too much- if you want to stay awake."
3,Nice music to listen to while driving to the mall,"Botti is a pleasant trumpeter who appeals to the type of causal jazz listener that lionized Chet Baker in the 1950s or Grover Washington in the 1980s. For the Amazon reviewer who said that Botti is better than Miles Davis and that Jill Scott's version of Good Morning Heartache is better than Billie Holiday-----well, I have to respond. Miles had more to say when he was sick trying to kick heroin and Scott is a mere vocal neophyte compared to Holiday. Study your music history.JB"
1,"Unplayable on my CD player, dangerous on my computer","I heard this CD at a music store, loved the music, but it would not play on my CD player. I was about to play it on my computer when I read the reviews on line here, so I am returning the CD. This Dual Disk business is a BAD IDEA. If I want visuals, I will play a DVD on purpose. Producers should quit attempting to force things on us we don't want. A pity because this music is great. A real waste."
3,Better Than Miles?,"That guy at the beginning of the reviews for this CD cannot be serious. Chris Botti is better that Miles Davis? Does he also think Kenny G. is better than John Coltrane?Jazz fans, when a review begins like that one, move on."
1,A CD I cannot use,"I listen to my music on my computer through iTunes. I bought this CD assuming I would be able to import it to iTunes like the others I have purchased in the past. That is impossible with this ""ENHANCED"" CD. In fact it includes a warning that you must uninstall it immediately to protect the security of your computer. The music may be good, I wouldn't know. The only thing I have been able to listen to is the samples on Amazon. I guess I will be buying my music through iTunes in the future. Amazon should be more persistent in posting warnings about SONY CD's."
5,Chris Botti - A wonderful Musician,"Loved it! Saw the PBS show and had to have it. Loved the music he chose as well as the artists. He has that certain something....great musician, personable. It doesn't hurt that he is Italian...very warm."
1,Charged up once and only once,"Save your money. This item may be cheap compared to the others on the market, but you DO get what you pay for.The battery charged up once, but will not take a second charge. I contacted the seller, Eforcity, via emailseeking a replacement, but have not received a response."
2,Not a top notch battery,This is an after market battery manufactured my whom I don't know. It does not keep it's charge very long and in fact just attached to the camera with all switches off the battery will still drain. It is OK when you first start using after a charge but them the charges dissipates very quickly. I did not get the same length of charge out of this battery that I get from the original Panasonic. On the other hand I paid a lot less for this battery. I think I'll stick to a name brand the next time.
1,Hoser,"Received battery in a timely manner. After charging through the night, the battery cut off every minute during taping. I was very disappointed as I missed most of my son's soccer game and I threw the product in the trash."
4,Mannlicher Military Rifles: Straight Pull and Turn Bolt Designs,"A useful book for collectors of Mannlicher Military Rifles, was easy to read and reasonably comprehensive. Only addition I suggest, would have been Steyr production figures and serial number rnages which collectors owuld find useful."
4,Somber Tale,"The South, the story of an Irish woman who falls in love with a Spanish anarchist in 1950's Barcelona, is captivating but tragic.Katherine Proctor, the Irish woman, was a well developed character and, throughout the novel, I was interested in herand cared about her. Often I wondered at her decisions because her chosen life with Miguel is poverty stricken, at timesviolent and sometimes impossible to continue. The most fascinating aspect for me was the revelation of the complexevents of the Spanish Civil War and, especially, the way Franco continued to hunt down those who had fought againsthis Nationalist army. The plot moves slowly, but that was not a problem for me. Overall,though, the book is a sad one; it beginsthis way and only becomes more so. Yet, I still feel it was valuable to read."
1,"Toibin's ""The South."" self-absorbed searching for self","Review of ""The South"" by Colm Toibin, received via AmazonThis Colm Toibin novel is a disappointment. It's about an Irish artist and mother who needs to fulfill herself by abandoning her husband and child to experience hardships and harrassments with an anarchist-lover in the aftermath of Franco's Spanish Civil War victory. With the support of another (self?)-exiled Irish artist, she has success as an artist, despite the nonchalant loss of an infant daughter. She ends up returning to Ireland to visit the son abandoned decades ago and basically remains a totally self-centered individual. There's really no character development here and one feels the same empathy for her as one might feel for the sometime Hungarian Nazi collaborator in ""The English Patient.""W.F. Ryan"
5,Marquez only does Superb!,"A set of short semi linked stories set in and around the wonderful Latin American Kingdom Maquez created in '100 Years of Solitude' including the novella of the Colonel, who fought in the revolution and has been betrayed;relying on a Cock to win him some money to keep starvation at bay.This is a superb collection, each tale in some way telling of the futile revolutions that never end up benefiting the people; the stiffling bureaucracy, the corruption, nepotism and autocracy of Latin American politics and life in a small town.Stand out stories ; 'There are no Thieves in this Town' where a pointless theft of the billiard balls from the pool hall affects the whole life of the town and reaps an innocent victim;the lyrical fable 'One Day After Saturday' and 'Montiels Widow'; a Town changes when the local tyrant dies...But the whole book is superb. Garcia Marquez just doesn't do 'average' and reading him is a pleasure."
4,a good hammer,"I DO ENJOY THIS HAMMER ,FOR THE PRICE ....A LITTLE PRICEY FOR SURE.I WOULD NOT GET THE RIPPLE HANDEL I TAPE MINE BECAUSE I GOT ALL RED IN THE HAND.THE RUBBER IS ANTI SLIP SO A SMOOTHS ONE IS OK. I GOT THIS OVER 2 YEARS AGO."
2,This hammer sucks,"I got this hammer as a gift, I would never spend $250.00 on a hammer. Everyday I have to tighten the bolt to make sure the face doesn't come off. When I pry wood apart I use two hammers, I was hitting head to head with the stilleto and a $30 vaughn hammer and the stilleto head blew apart, So I went to the tool store to get a replacement head and it was $40.00. So I walked out and the next day at the job site I threw the hammer in the dumpster."
1,"Once again, These are not real movies......","A movie has a script and a great cast. These movies have neither. They are trash. It's not even great trash, It's just trash. Daytime Tv soaps are better then this."
4,Wild Man Island,"Andy Galloway went on a sea kayak trip to Alaska. On the last day of the trip, Andy takes off by himself and heads to the island that his dad died on. He wants to find more about the island. He gets there. He explores it. Then on his way back to camp, he gets in a storm and the wind blows him to a whole new island. He is stranded there with no food or water or shelter. He is freezing cold and wet with no new clothes. He has many encounters with bears, wolves and dogs. He then meets a wild man that lives on the island. Will Andy ever get off the island and back to Colorado where he lives? Find out in this action-packed book."
2,Plot has obvious solvable conflict,"Warn this review has spoilers.I realize that in it's infancy TV production was low budget and they had to depend on the skill of the writers and big production values. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The premise of this story is that a writer is paid to finish fictional stories initiated by the devil, but with the resulting ending come true for real people who suffer the fate written by the author. Duh! Why didn't he just write happy endings, the devil was satisfied with anything he wrote and gave him no guidelines? Another thing, as the story progressed, the wife did become more and more unreasonable and unlikeable and it didn't bother me so much that she did die in the end.Oh well, good thing Leslie Nilson went on to more polished and professional projects such as Airplane. :-) (actually, one of my all time favorite comedies.)"
3,A fantastically magical book!,"I think this book is best suited for a younger audience (perhaps grades five and six). However, if you like a imaginative book that makes you feel as though you're being caried into another world I think you'll adore this one. No matter how old you are, you are never too old to imagine and this book will keep you doing just that. One of the things I liked best about the writing of this book is how the author used a little bit of reality mixed with some creativity and magic to make one of the best fictional childrens books I've read in a long time."
3,Average at Best,"As an avid reader of children's fantasy/magic stories, I found this book to be average at best. The idea was good, the main character traveling through time in the fog, but the story really didn't ""go"" anywhere. Not a bad read, but there are better books out there."
5,Economic Journalist Explores The Third World,"Major U.S. banks have knowingly dealt with the corrupt elites of the world's developing countries.They have harbored capital flight from wealthy investors who had lost confidence in their country.They have extended loans to corrupt industrialists, who promptly skimmed the profits and, through their political connections, convinced the national governments to guarantee the loans, placing the burden on the backs of the poor.They have lent money to violently repressive military dictators.They have accepted bribes; they have offered bribes; they have turned a blind eye to untold human suffering."
5,The Dark Side of Global Private Banking,"This book is an eye-opening account of the financial chicanery that lay behind countless poorly planned, badly executed, over-priced and economically unviable development projects that were undertaken in Africa, Asia and Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s. Henry exposes the role played by leading international financial institutions in fueling the growth of dubious forms of transnational economic activity and shows how their behavior has been tolerated and even encouraged by the IMF, the World Bank and the US Treasury. He also sheds light on the influence that international financial interests have had on political developments in the third world - from the overthrow of Allende's elected government in Chile and the funding provided to Nicaragua's Contra rebels, to the support of thieving dictators like Ferdinand Marcos, General Somoza and Carlos Salinas, just to mention a few."
5,Drums and Bass Lesson,"Here we have some of the greatest musicians to ever grace the earth. Anthony Jackson (one of the top five bass players of our time) who considerably raised the standard , and Steve Gadd, the greatest drummer in the world. If one wants to learn how to play music in it's purest form listen to this recording among the countless other recordings these incomparably brilliant musicians have touched with their genius."
1,Elevator Music In Disguise,"The problem with this and every Dave Grusin Disc is that it is listed in the Jazz section. Grusin knows how to play jazz, but this is not it. This is the beginning of the light jazz movement, the beginning of GRP records in the early '80's, where people like Grusin tried to make jazz palatable to the general public. It is palatable, but it isn't jazz. If you wanted to categorize this in the context of easy listening, then it's listenable. It's totally frustrating, because you are waiting for the players to play something, and they keep playing the theme over and over. I could never understand how this music didn't put them to sleep and bore them to tears. Also, the tunes are totally forgetable. If you want to hear jazz stay away from this. As far as the electric components that Grusin has integrated into this, there are far better selections to purchase than this. This is nerd music, really poor."
4,"Fascinating, Intriguing Stories for Mystery Lovers","I have read many of Alfred Hitchcock's series of horror/mystery books and this is one of the best. Almost all of the stories are worth reading. The most particularly notable ones are: Tomorrow and Tomorrow (Adobe James)(an absolutely horrendous story about revenge), A Good Head for Murder (Charles Runyon), Invisible Cat (Betty Ren Wright), and The Distributor (Richard Matheson). I think that A Good Head for Murder as well as Invisible Cat are absolutely two of the best suspense short stories that I have ever read.A great book for mystery/horror lovers."
3,Alfred Hitchcock Presents Stories to Be Read With the Door L,"If you enjoy thrilling short stories than this book is a fun read. Although it is my opinion that only one in two stories are worthy of recommendation, I was genuinely disappointed when I realized that I had read every one (I did not read the stories in the order they were published). Plus, it is worth mentioning that three stories in this book alone are worth the trouble of finding this book and reading it."
5,THIS CD IS EXCELLENT !,"JUST GOT THIS CD AND THINK IT IS SO COOL.IT HAS A TOTALLY CONTEMPORARY SOUND, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF A PIECE OF THIS MUSIC WAS IN THE BILLBOARD TOP 100 !!THERE ARE DIFFERENT TUNES TO DIFFERENT SETS OF AFFIRMATIONS, WHICH MAKE THIS CD, VERY VERY INTERESTING AND UNIQUE.IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS LOUISE HAS EVER RELEASED...AND CREDIT TO MARK CHAIT TOO.IF YOUR A FAN OR NOT, THIS CD IS DEFINATELY WORTH THE PRICE!!"
3,Questionable recording,"I thought the beginning was great. Then I got a little scared by some of the words that were used. I have gotten so accustomed to Louise hays voice it has become such a healing relaxed like state I was in and sayings like ""Doors Opening"" and the like quite frankly frightened me. So I skip the tracks I do not want to hear and just listen to the ones that do think is benificial to my overall well being."
5,Great Music,The music that accompanies the affirmations is very soothing and great to listen to. Highly recommend it.
1,Bad theology,"Suffers the same problems as Bernard's earlier work ""the Oneness of God"". That is, it is too blatantly biased to be taken seriously. Bernard simply ignores any and all evidence contrary to his distorted views."
4,Excellent!,"Hilary Hahn may not have the artistic depth of Nathan Milstein (yet), but her Bach is terrific. No nonsense musical ideas and unsurpassed technique and intonation."
2,Average,"Frankly speaking, album is far from being a great performance. Maybe she is very young, maybe she is very successful, it's ok. But if you look for German spirit, if you look for depth, I do not recommend. This is automatic, standart Bach, school Bach."
3,The bands great. The record is rough,"The Magick Markers are a really cool band. However the recording quality on Songs for Sada Jane are a little rough. This, in no way, takes away from the quality of the songs, which are great noise pieces. It's just that if you are looking for a really great record, pick up Magick Markers- Boss, on the Ecstatic Peace label."
2,Buyer Beware...Remakes,"Just for the record, these are NOT the original hits. They are remakes, however, I have only heard the remakes on my local radio station and am used to these versions and have not actually heard the original versions. The CD case admits, albeit in very small print on the back, that these are new stereo recordings."
3,No faces at all,"This book contains around 123 pictures in a variety of sizes. Some in colors and some in black and white.If you are only interested in viewing genitals then this book may be something for you. However, there are websites on The Internet that would provide much higher quality in that regard.I did not appreciate the book because there were no faces in the pictures. I did not find viewing genitals on their own interesting.That being said, the book certainly contains what one would expect. Hardly the best specimens, though."
5,Appreciation for the male appendage,Stunning photography and exceptional models set this book apart from similar publications. Definitely a worthwhile book.
3,For IT Managers Only!,"If you are a senior manager/general manager this book is not for you. If you are an IT manager, you will probably enjoy it. Chapters 5 and 6 are much too detailed for non-IT managers.This book is listed under ""strategic organizational change."" If that is what you are looking for, checkout Kotter, Beitler, Black & Gregerson, Collins, etc."
3,"Great CD, dissappointed by bad quality case","I love this wonderful Christmas CD so I ordered three new ones directly from Amazon (not a seller) for Christmas gifts. The ""new"" CDs have arrived and the covers are scratched up!!! They are in wrappers like they are new but the plastic cases are scratched and one is even cracked. I thought I was getting a new quality CD and case. If the covers are flawed will the CDs work? Because I want to give them as gifts I am very disappointed at the less than perfect quality of the cases.The music is beautiful so I am returning them and reordering."
4,An unexpected emotional ride,"I discovered the Midnight Louie books over 2 years ago and have ravenosly read them all. Cat in a Neon Nightmare is full of unexpected surprises. A major chapter unexpectedly closes here and through Mrs. Nelson Douglas' artistry we are made to feel the void opened by this event as closely as those it affects in the book. Almost every character this time around is exposed to a truth or happenstance that disappoints them/shocks them at a deep soul biting level and we feel it right with them. Everything is not black and white, not all things happen due to premeditation--like real life--somethings just do. A wonderful continuation of the Midnight Louie adventures and by the emotions it evokes, a wonderful example of what a writer can make their readers feel when they have a grasp of the craft as well as Carole Nelson Douglas obviously does. Huzzah!"
4,Mignight Louie,"Enjoyed the book. "" Louie"" and ""Louise are"" favorites as usual. Story was more in depth than usual but well done."
4,Very cute book,"A really cute story and great illustration. My son is 4 and really enjoys this book. Has helped him connect the concepts of friends and teamwork. Easy read. Illustration is very well done. We don't read this every night like a few others.. but, my son will surprise me somethings and say, ""I want to read Fox."" So, it sticks with him... definitely not a one-hit-wonder. I'd recommend and I am glad we have this book."
4,"It's Not Just a Circus, It's An Adventure!","I love the title of the book! It's mainly the reason why I bought it. However, I almost didn't read beyond the introduction. I began to think, ""This isn't for me!"" Among the folks who decided to ""run away"" included a stockbroker (yoga instructor), a lawyer (blacksmith) and a company vice president (winery owner), people who could most likely afford to leave the corporate world behind and yet still be financially secure when they started up their new ventures.I would have preferred an introduction that included what an everyday office worker or a laborer dreams about doing. They want to run away too, but can't afford to hop aboard the circus train. Whose success story can they read and really relate to for inspiration?Running away and joining the circus is a grand idea if you're looking for something new, exciting, and fun! The adventure lies in getting there. Just make sure you don't end up with the same bunch of clowns! And watch where you step!"
1,Poorly Written and Elementry,"I TOTALLY disagree with John Glenn, this is poorly written and reads like a grade school ""how to book"". Those with basic common sense and an IQ over 10 would spend their time more productively watching paint dry.I could barely finish reading it...."
4,Makes me want to dance,"Ken Holloway has a great way of talking about life with Jesus - in a way that finds me singing it later - if not actually dancing! He is real country, not just leaning toward county music. I couldn't help but love the music and lyrics - and find even those who are not fans of country gospel like this album."
4,nice album,Not often you get a country sound with christian lyrics. Nice piece of work. Ken haves a mellow voice that flows good with the music. Really enjoyed this album. A rare but classic album. MANY THANKS TO THE SELLER!
4,Advertising Bad,"Ordered this camera because it seemed like an amazing deal, for the kit with the lens and the dateback body. Package arrived, it's the standard body in the kit. Be aware of false advertising/very expensive typo..."
1,My camera dont work,"I have purchased this camera and it stop of working after 3 months, (I wrote The first review on amazon for this camera) I have lost my money :("
2,"Nice pictures, bad craftsmanship","I've owned the Ti for two years. I've taken many good photos over the past two years, and really enjoyed the quality of close up pictures with the included lens. I have been disappointed a few times with taking landscape night photos. Even when the camera is sitting still on a flat surface, its still hit and miss with a long exposure.Recently, the very tiny plastic piece that latches the film cover closed broke, rendering the camera useless. Once more it didn't break from a hard drop, or massive hit. It simply broke after I set it down on a table. Even though I've had the camera for two years, I'd say I've only gone through less than two dozen rolls of film. So it can't have broken from excessive use either.Luckily I bought an extended warranty and will not be out $300, but now I think I may make the move to digital. If you want to stick with 35mm, the Canon rebel series is good while it lasts, but be sure to protect your investment with an extended warranty."
4,Great camera for intermediate photographer/scrapbooker,"I purchased this camera 1 1/2 years ago under the advise of my sister, who is a professional photographer, and I LOVE IT! It is so easy to use, no other can compare. Beautiful photos outdoors but flash is a bit harsh indoors (lots of shadow and overexposed skin tones, even at a distance) I will admit that I don't use the manual modes (only the different modes of automatic) so I am certain there are ways to balance the light of an automatic flash, but I take TONS of photos of my 3 kids with this camera for their scrapbooks and I am rarely disappointed. Excellent for a mom/dad to get great shots of the family. I am currently looking into a digital camera to complement this one, but this Canon is sticking with me as my primary/predictable sidekick."
1,Juvenile and overwritten,"This is a ""Bridget Jones Diary"" wannabe but without: 1.decent writing 2. believable dialogue 3. likable or credible characters, or 4. wit. I've never written a review about any book, but if I can save just one person from buying this horrible thing, I consider my time well spent. The author is overcome with her own wit, which is so far from being amusing that I found myself cringing at every line. I finally put the book in the furthest reaches of my shelves with a note on it not to lend it to anyone I like. It's like a bad ""Three's Company"" type of sitcom."
2,Incredibly Crude,"Maybe I'm missing something by quitting halfway through, but I found the book annoying and disgusting. (And it's hard to disgust me)"
5,Just Too Funny For Words!,"Kathy Lette is one of the most talented writers I have come across in a long time. Her wit is sharp and her ability to bring it to the written page is magical. This story of Becky Steele, a woman who wants her cake and eat it too, will make you laugh out loud, wince in despair at her ludicrous life choices, astound you with her amazing ability to live out what should only be fantasies ... I could just go on and on. The book is funny, sexy, a little on the crude side at times - but I adored it!"
4,Naughty but Nice,"Becky is in her 30's and about to get married, but at the last minute...she asks herself, ""Am I really ready to be with just one guy for the rest of my life?"" No more one night stands? No more lustful encounters?"" And this is where the book takes off...with Becky and her journey through love, lust, marriage, divorce, betrayal, friendship, and well LIFE!Poor Julian, Becky's fiancée, doesn't know what hit him with Becky runs off with Zach, a new and upcoming rap star she meets in London - who is much younger than her to boot! Where will life take her? Who will she choose? Who will have her? Well, you will have to get this book because I am not going to give all of it away!This book has everything and will have your head in a spin! Your stomach will hurt with laughter! I highly recommend this book! I can not wait to read my next book by Lette! If you like Brit Lit - you will most defiantly like this book (Lette is Australian, but the book takes place in London)"
4,Hysterical,"I found this book to be simultanously well-written and poorly written. But, the author is so witty and the book so funny, that I quickly forgave any faults. What's good: An amazingly enjoyable read - everything that you think and can't say, wish you could do, but wouldn't dare, well... it's in here! What's bad: the plot is a little over the top (although, I admit, in all fairness, that is rather the point...) and some of the writing is mediocre at best (does any American speak like Lette writes????). Still, overlook the problems and enjoy! You won't be sorry..."
3,pocket-size reference for the Bodhisattva Vow,"This pocket-size book addresses ""The Bodhisattva Vow."" It includes lineages, aspiration/implementation Bodhichitta, commitments, downfalls, ceremonies, and vow restoration. It covers the informational aspects of its subject rather completely. It does not include much commentary or explanation however. It is VERY suitable as a reference for someone who has taken the vow and also is quite valuable for someone contemplating taking it in the near future. It does not begin to describe the actual Bodhisattva Path. For that, see some version of Shantideva's famous text such as Kelsang Gyatso's ""Meaningful to Behold."""
3,Mrs. Mike,"This was pretty good for the time the movie was made. However, Mrs. Mike is a true story and the movie left out many important events. The Flannigans had two children, a daughter and a son who both died from the Diphtheria outbreak. The movie also left out that Kathy and Mike adopted twins and also O-Be-Joyful's baby when Kathy returned from Boston. O-Be-Joyful was never mentioned in the movie, probably because she was Indian. Also, there was alot of interaction with the local natives that was left out and the little that was brought up, was shown in a poor light. Considering the stupid prejudice, that was shown toward native people at the time this movie was made, it makes perfect sense why these events were omitted. Also, Dick Powell was a poor cast. He did not fit the image of a rugged mountie. This is a great story! I wish Hallmark or someone else would pick it up and redo the movie. It has alot of potential. I highly recommend the book, it is wonderful!"
5,Great movie!,"If you have not seen this movie yet, it's a must see. Awesome cast, great film that you will enjoy over and over! Definitely a favorite of mine!!"
5,One of the best films of 2006 and of all time.,"I saw this movie and was blown away by how good it was. I knew it would be good because it had Jack Nicholason playing a Mob boss, it was one of his best rolls. Leonardo DeCaprio does the best performance I have ever seen him do, Matt Damon was good as usual, Mark Whalberg being the most hardcore character in the movie. And lets not forget Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Anthony Anderson. This movie should win oscars for best actor, best supporting actor, and of course for best director."
1,Misleading,"I have just read Message From Forever as with Ms. Morgan's first book, Mutant Message Down Under when it first came out. I found them to have a strong message we can learn from and live by, but at the same time, none of the writing regarding aboriginal wisdom or traditions or it's people can be believed. It is all made-up. For this reason, I would not recommend this book."
1,Whose wisdom?,"I would not recommend this book for Australian readers as its clearly written for US readers. In Australia we dont 'fix' drinks nor put 'diapers' on our babies. The lack of Australian idiom is a dead give-away that she does'nt know too much about this place. Her 10th anniversary comments (in Mutant Message Down Under) about Alice Kelly being the most powerful Aboriginal female leader on the continent is absolutely ridiculous, as there are thousands of senior law men and women and none of them would claim to be the most powerful, this very non-Aboriginal claim only goes to show how little Morgan understands of community, rather than individual interest. Its embarrassing that she is so far off the mark."
1,This Aboriginal Woman Says Please DON'T Buy This Book,Well it angers and saddens me that MM has produced another bout of cultural exploitation. When will she ever learn? After the last fiasco. As an Australian Aboriginal woman I can tell you don't waste your money on this book - it is an insult to Aboriginal people and many Aboriginal have protested against this woman's blatent lies. Obviously the author and her publishers aren't listening to Aboriginal people.She doesn't know anything about Aboriginal culture and the book is nothing but ego parading as literature. Please don't insult Aboriginal people any further by buying or promoting this book.
5,INSPIRING & INSIGHTFUL :0),"Marlo, You've done a wonderful piece of work. I hope to see this piece made into a film--it would be magnificent!To all seeking spiritual enlightenment and wisdom, consider reading this book. If you are seeking change, this book may help.Peace and bright blessings."
4,Who has fear to read the book?,"When reading the book I can't judge about historical correctness of it. But it's very interesting that this bad review from ""an Aboriginal Woman"" is not signed with a name, but ""a reader"".A review like this I would assume is written by one of the descendents of those white people who were (are) so sure to do the right things with the Aborigines in the past.Or:A review like this I assume is written by one who is not willing to accept that there is another way of life and that very basic rules of our ""civilized"" society might be wrong.There is one thing to be sure: Those, who accept the message of the book, those will be the last to blame anybody for their opposite opinion. So, why not critizing openly?"
5,Mutant Message from Forever,I bought this as a gift for a friend who is planning a trip to Australia. The story line in the booktouched my heart.
4,Good reference,"Barron's always had the edge on prep books and this one is no different. With test questions, interview techniques, and helpful tips and tricks, this book was excellent. I managed to pass my exams and interviews with flying colors! A MUST HAVE for the future Police Officer!"
4,Great book.,This is a very large and detailed book. The price is excellent and you can't beat what you get out of it. I've paid six times as much for a police book and didn't get what this book provided.
3,Barron's police officer exam booklet,"Since buying this book I have taken 2 test for law enforcement/security postitions. Before the test I was able to read about 60 percent of the book and take a few of the practice test. I certainly felt more prepared having the book even though I only passed one test with flying colors.From my own personal experience I did not recieve any memory questions, which I had practiced for using this book. I also found that there were a decent amount of spelling and grammar questions, and this book doesn't seem to have any grammar practice questions.Recently I just purchased Barron's Correction officer exam practice booklet. While the book and questions are very similar, the correctional book will help with your grammar.If your new to these test or if you want to brush up on the basics, then purchase one of Barron's booklets. I passed a test for one of best police force in the country and I owe some credit to this book."
3,VERY Informative,The best thing that you can do for yourself is find out what is on the test that you'll be taking. I used this book to study and the test i took couldn't have been further from the topics discussed in this book. It is a great way to get yourself to study better and think more bout the answers you give.
1,Poor,"this charger worked one time, but will no longer even light up, put it in another car and it still did not work. I would have returned it but had lost the paper work on it. I am still in the need of a charger for my car."
4,still carrying a Razor,Good product if you are still carrying a Razor. I don't need a smart phone. Maybe one day.
2,You get what you pay for.,"It worked fine the first few times I used it, then I had to position it a certain way for it to start charging, and if I didn't pay attention, it would randomly stop charging (before the battery was fully charged, of course). After about two weeks of that I had to hold it in the phone at a certain angle or it wouldn't charge. And after that it just stopped working all together. I would have rather bought the Motorola brand charger in the first place than to have wasted any money on this one first, only to have to buy the brand name later. Note: I was using this as my sole phone charger with an adapter for the wall plug (this adapter had no problems whatsoever with my Nokia car charger, which I used for three years). It was very inconvenient for me when this charger stopped working."
3,Decent for the price,"It DOES charge, but you have to hold the charger in the phone a certain way so it kind of defeats the purpose of charging while driving since you have to hold it in...but it was a good price, so it's okay"
4,Battery Charger,I can't believe the price markup on this product. I hope it works as long as I have my Phone
5,car charger,this was putchased for my grandaughter. She has used this frequently it came in very handy on vacation last summer.
3,Car charger OEM,"It does it's job. it will charge up the battery, what more could it do?The product was okay. I have never had a Blackberry, but it work on the razr."
5,Fits Like A Glove,"These drummers gloves fit perfectly.I'm glad I bought them.The seller was very prompt and his speed was quite fast.I did speak with him on the phone before I purchased and he was very friendly and helpful.I will do business with this seller again,if I have a need.These gloves are fulfilling a need that I had.I used to put wax on my sticks in order to grip them,but the wax began to dry out my hands and they cracked.These gloves allow me to eliminate the wax altogether."
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book thinking it would be in a similar style as the Eclectic Readers. I was wrong. It is just list of word with similar sounds or spellings. I suppose there is a logical progression for the material, but we choose not to use this in our homeschool right now for lack of exercises and activities to use the words. We need a more visually exciting approach."
5,This is a fabulous musical!!,"Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn are fabulous in this romantic and magical musical. The songs are classics, the scenery of Paris are breathtaking and Audrey Hepburn's wardrobe is to die for. I am a big fan of musicals and this is one of the best one of that time. This is definitely a must see if you are a fan of Gerswin musicals."
4,Funny Face 1956,"Paris , The city of Light , Shines even brighter when Audrey Hepburn (1929-1993) and Fred Astaire (1899-1987) team up for the only time and bring their luminous starpower to this exquisite musical featuring songs by George (1898-1937) and Ira (1896-1983) Gerschwin .This dazzling romp -Filmed on Location in Paris where you could go back in time and see Paris year 1956 , wonderful made on Tour Eifel ,Sacre Ceur , Notre Dame , Louvre and many other known tourist places ! . In role of a bookstore clerk transformed into modeling sensations , Hepburn showcases singing and dancing . Fred Astaire as the fashion photographer who discovers her , conjures up his inimitable magic sequeces of many songs . This Movie are a must for all nostalgic movie lovers and a RECOMMENDATION !. Super High Quality transfer !"
2,Not as good as I expected,"This movie was made on the downswing of what was known as the Golden Age of musicals, and I think it shows. By this time both movies and actors were focusing less on song and dance, and more on drama. It's easy to see that in this film. Except for Fred Astaire, anybody else singing and dancing in this movie is highly distressing. The romance between Audrey and Fred isn't very inspired and poorly developed. Any of the characters other than Fred and Audrey feel like a waste of screen time, because they don't appear to significantly contribute to the story. Honestly I had a hard time watching this."
3,Could've Been Better...,"I saw this on TCM recently, and I have to admit to being a little disappointed.I've always liked Audrey Hepburn, but frankly, I found her character a little irritating and a little too ""precious.""Fred Astaire is good, as usual, but the age difference between him and his co-star (who are romantically involved in the movie) made me uncomfortable. Astaire was actually thirty years older than Hepburn, but somehow the gap to me seemed greater. (I felt as if he could've been her grandfather!)Kay Thompson was good but lacked star power.The movie is lovely to look at, and the scenes wherein Hepburn is photographed by Astaire (with the slick use of stop-photography) are the best in the movie.And I thought that Hepburn was a surprisingly good dancer.But the movie just lacked a certain ""umph."""
4,Beauty before Age,"Funny Face is not a great film, but it is such a slice of the 1950s that one forgives it. What makes it work of course is Audrey Hepburn -- the amusing thing is that when she is dowdy she is contemporary, and when she is made up she is 1950s. Everyone else looks hopeless and old. That is the reason why Fred Astaire's age does matter in the film: he is a constant reminder that Audrey is the epitome of the oncoming cult of adolescence/childism which is just about to doom the whole ""older is better"" enterprise. But he is amazing: the best dance scene is the one in the bookshop, so subtle.The wisest person in the film is the director, Stanley Donen, who takes every opportunity to photograph Hepburn in closeup, as if he will never get another chance (though he will). She never really looked more beautiful than in the early scenes before the adults get to her.....I do wonder how they trained the swans."
5,Great quality,I love this movie. Great quality. Audrey Hepburn is awesome in this movie. Great seller. Brand new. I bought two copies. One for me and one for a friend.
1,Funny Face,The movie is great but the recording is terrible. I can hardly understand it.It must be a very cheap coppy of the original. Most likely a rip off of the originakl.
2,Not Worth Buying,"I wish I'd rented this movie instead of buying it. I was looking forward to watching a beautiful love story unfold between Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. Yes, there's a huge age difference between the two in this film but the romance between them was not totally unbelievable. It just wasn't very inspiring. And the entire movie wasn't very interesting or fun to watch."
4,A LITTLE CUTE BUT...,"Perhaps this musical is a little cute by today's often cynical standard,but that's because we lost the ability to dream.I beleive this film to be ASTAIRE's last good musical along with THE BAND WAGON.Not surpringly,FRED had starred with his sister ADELE in the 1927 original GERSHWIN show.What is important here is not the story but it's treatment full of ingenious fresh ideas by director DONEN.For example,the use of color is often amazing;you can actually feel the makers had a field day playing with it.The wedding sequences are fun to watch.We all know that AUDREY HEPBURN could have been FRED's daughter.To tell you the truth, i don't mind because they dance so well together."
4,Funny Face Needs No Botox,This anniversary reissue is surprisingly not dated. Audrey Hepburn is beautiful and charming. The dance scenes are amazing. It makes you remember what an innovative dancer Fred Astaire was. All in all a good experience in nostaglia and the American musical form.
2,Stodgy affair,"It's always nice to watch your favourite stars, and I expect this movie would fall completely flat if it wasn't for the presence of Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn. As it is, the first half of the movie is remarkably dull and stodgy and fails to entertain. Things start to pick up thereafter, from about the point of Astaire and Hepburn's photoshoot around Paris (with some nice location filming), but still the results are somewhat mediocre by comparison with the stars' other movies. By 1957 movie musicals were moving beyond the kind of lyrics that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but the writers of 'Funny Face' seem to have missed out on the trend, and most of the songs belong to an earlier era of movie-making. The star presence and a few memorable moments save the day, but otherwise the whole thing is rather a disappointment."
3,The music and dancing saves this movie,I had to write a review because I want to respond the people who don't like the Astaire/Hepburn relationship. It's just a vehicle to get these two actors together in a song and dance movie to showcase Fred Astaire. She dances well which was a surprise to me. So he was somewhat older? He was a monstrous star and he still danced really well.Having said that the story was a bit too predictable. The overall feel of the film was just OK. Can't fault the Gershwin music though and the dancing was good.
3,Fred Astaire as sexual predator.,"Overall as musicals go, this is ok, but I was very uncomfortable with Fred Astaire acting like a sexual predator. The way he aggressively approached and man handled Audrey was atrocious."
1,Comical Countenance,"This is a weak picture which tries to spiff itself up with the use of colour (primarily pink), clubs (invariably smokey and saxophoney) and dance routines (not nearly as good as some routines I've seen - take White Christmas for an example of excellence). Somehow all three of these attempts fail utterly. Audrey Hepburn alone shines here, but her light is fogged by steam from trains, cigarette smoke, and other actors who get in her way. I particularly refer to Kay Thompson's character, who was downright annoying, and the guru with the beard that Audrey's character loved so much until she realised he was human. All throughout I kept thinking, When are the songs going to stop and the real dialogue begin? It didn't. And, When is this going to end? It finally did. I don't think I'll ever bother to watch it again, or to spend any more time reviewing it here. I'm glad if you can enjoy it, but I somehow did not."
2,funny face..wonderful movie when sound's good,"I received this movie/dvd today and ran to my dvd. lol..It started and there was a buzzing sound. I figured maybe it would go away after a while but no. I'm not sending it back, but I'm warning all of you who order this that the sound quality IS AWFUL! This was supposed to be a 'new' dvd. :( sigh...sigh..what a waste and I simply adore Audrey's movies. :)"
3,We're simply tourist...,"Another fun and cheerful musical, but with a most unusual starring character. Audrey Hepburn is charming and delightful as a philosophical bookworm. I don't buy the romantic relationship between her and Fred Astaire's characters, but Astaire's dancing seems to gloss over that little flaw in the casting. The songs aren't great, but the music helps to keep the story moving. You really have to like the actors in this to enjoy it, because it's not a great story. It's rather sweet and tries to be interesting, but falls short of great. The costumes by Givenchy are incredibly beautiful and Hepburn looks fabulous in them."
5,Worth it for the clothes alone!,"Hepburn, Astaire, Paris, Gershwin - what more do you want? Add in stunning clothes and visuals, not to mention the amazing Kay Thompson, and you have two hours of blissful, escapist fun. Indulge yourself!"
5,Audrey Hepburn steals the screen.,"I was sick and plastered to the couch, changing from channel to channel, and saw that ""Funny Face"" was coming on. I'll give it a try, I thought, and I'm very glad I did! Hepburn plays an intelligent, but un-fashionable girl who is spotted by fashion magazine photographer Astaire. Despite her first rejections she is taken away to Paris where she and Astaire fall in love. Sure, the story has been done before, but Astaire and Hepburn make it so absolutely charming that you can't help but smile. I loved how Hepburn's character was not only elegant and beautiful, but intelligent and artsy as well. My favorite part is when Hepburn starts dancing in the Paris club, she was an amazing dancer. The Gerswhin music was another great touch. I have to agree with the reviewer below mine, I'm 14 and I would prefer a classic like this to any of that teen-flick junk we get. Funny Face is a must for anyone, it will surely lighten up your day!"
3,Worth it for Hepburn fans,"This is an odd little musical. Audrey Hepburn plays a book shop clerk that is discovered by a fashion magazine, and travels to Paris as their newest model. There she explores the underground nightlife and begins to develop a romance with her photographer, played by Fred Astaire.The performances are fine all around, and Hepburn's stage talents particularly shine through in one solo routine in a nightclub. But the overall experience just isn't very memorable. Stacked against the major MGM musicals from the era, Funny Face lacks the boldness and scale of those productions (though much of the production staff was supposedly part of the MGM crew as well). It's not a bad film by any means, and certainly worth the purchase for Audrey or Fred Astaire fans, but it's not one you're going to remember these classic screen icons for."
1,ridiculous,"Uh, the author is a lawyer, which means her first obligation is to uphold the law. This means gathering up the illegal aliens and getting them out of the country, quickly. Instead, this ""lawyer"" decides that it's more important to figure out how to screw what remains of middle-class America in order to get ""rights"" and such for the criminals. Nice."
2,McDrum & Bass,"I don't consider myself to be a hardcore D& B head but, after being introduced to Size and Reprazent through masterpieces like ""Hero"" and ""Brown Paper Bag"", his newest work, ""In the Mode"", proved to be a large disappointment. Where older CD's like ""New Forms"" showed a certain creative genious in the choices of beats, vocals, and Jazz tracks; ""In the Mode"" comes off as soulless and manufactured. Many of the songs, like ""Who Told You?"", were almost overrun with vocals that became really annoying after only a few seconds. They also seemed to lack the same thought shown in earlier works. It was almost as if he were asked to sit down with a drum machine and make things up off the top of his head. There were a few high points like the dancable ""Lucky Preassure"" and, ""Mexican"" but, there weren't quite enough to make me feel better about wasting my money."
3,"Beats Galore...... Yeah, He Got That.","I'm fealing this mostly because of the phat beats roni drops on this CD. Method Man, Rahzel and Zack De La Rocha bless some of the tracks with ill ryhmes. I think his previous work was much better but not to take anything away from this one. This sounds a bit commercialized not the R.Size I'm use to.oNe"
2,mediocre,"this album is not for die hard drum n bass heads. it's a crossover attempt to attract non drum n bass heads.get it for the production, because roni is spot on as usual. but the annoying vocals on tracks such as ""who told you"" and ""ghetto celebrity"" really killed my excitement for this album.think jungle mixed with MTV's ""total request live"" and you have this album in a big fat sellout nutshell.check out roni size's solo album for the realness."
3,see the future flex position,"The best thing about In the Mode is the sequencing. From ""Railing Pt. 2"" to ""Play the Game"", there is not one song that is out of place, making In the Mode a cohesive album statement. That being said, it is not without filler. Although it stretches for a diverse gamut of possiblities: R&B (""Lucky Pressure"", ""Staircase"", and ""Play the Game""), Rap (""System Check"", ""Ghetto Superstar"", and ""Dirty Beats""), and pure D-and-B (""Snapshots"", ""The Mexican""), it lacks consistency. But the album is almost worth getting for ""Snapshots"" alone, one of the greatest D-and-B songs ever recorded. The song uses the same ""slow,fast,break,fast,conclusion"" structure that New Forms' ""Brown Paper Bag"" has and when Roni Size and company use that formula, the results are breathtaking. However, In the Mode is nothing special. Give this one a pass. C+"
4,"Good Case, time will tell.","I got my first Protec tenor case about 8 years ago and was never really happy with it. It started falling apart after a couple years, and finally failed completely about 2 months ago. I looked around online for a replacement, leaning away from Protec, but after looking over the redesign for the newer model, I decided to give them another chance. I am much more impressed with the build on this case, and how well it holds my horn. One of the side pockets is large enough to hold a flute case, and the other one is almost big enough to hold a fake book. The backpack strap is also definitely a good investment with this case.Overall, for the price, this is a wonderful gigbag to take to rehearsal or a local show. Haven't put it thought the rigors of air travel yet, but I have a feeling it might not hold up to the TSA."
3,Two different horns did not fit.,"I tried both my son's Saxophone.com tenor and my Selmer Mark VI and neither fit in this case. I tried squeezing both horns down into it, no matter how scary this might be with the chance of bending a key. Neither horn allowed the top half of the case to get within an inch of the bottom half."
5,Pro-Pac Contoured Tenor Sax Case,"I have a Selmer, Mark 6 tenor.. and it fits into the pro-pac like a glove. Love the extra pockets located on the outside of the case. Don't like the way the two handle halfs snap together, have to line them perfectly"
4,Excellent case,"I bought this for my teenage son who play tenor. I figured that he needed a lighter weight and 'cooler' case than his old rectangle. He loves this case. Lightweight, solidly built, protects the tenor well and he doesnt look like a middle schooler toting his sax to school. The ability to attach a shoulder strap is a nice touch sinc ehe carries so much including school bag, and sports equipment."
3,"In depth biography, too many details for me.","Very detail biography of the prince who lived in Romanian. Sentence by sentence filled with dates and facts, not very entertaining for me. The same author writes another book that is much easier to read: ""In Search of Dracula"". It has all the disgusting things Dracula did plus some other infamous people.Stay away from this book unless you're a real history buff."
5,The inigma and the man,"I found ""Dracula: Prince of Many Faces"" to be a fastinating and accurate portrayal of the man behind the vampire ledgend. The noted historians who wrote this book frequently quoted original sources, which I as a historian see as a very solid foundation. They were very good about pointing out Dracula's qualities - excellent military leader, devotion to strenthening his nation - along with his violent excesses. They also tell us that his crimes against humanity were not considered uncommon in his day. The uncommon part was found in the huge number of exections rather than in their cruelty. He was both a charasmatic leader and a vicious tyrant - truly a complex figure of early Renaissance history. I found it very instrumental in the research I did for my own book, ""Vlad, a novel"" and would strongly recommend it for historians and non-historians alike.""Vlad, a novel"" is available at Amazon.com"
5,The Definitive Study.,"A truly comprehensive study of Dracula. The authors do an excellent job of not only recounting the details of Vlad's life, but the perceptions of that life, and what effects his actions had on the time period. So all-encompassing is this book that when I finished reading it I only had a single question (which was swiftly answered through correspondence with one of the authors)."
5,Eye Opening,"This book is one of the very few written in the English language to portray the historical figure of Dracula whose nickname was used by Bram Stocker. It is a work that was indeed needed in order to correct many wrong impressions about the historical figure of Dracula.Vlad ""The Impaler"" lived in a harsh world, an unforgiving one, full of strifes, intrigues from within his country and from outside. Written with a wide readership in mind this book succeedes to convey the sense of the age and the personality of the elusive prince."
5,Best Physics Book!,"This is really the best introduction physics book I have ever seen. It introduces beginners with (nearly) no knowledge in physics. All you should already have, is a basic knowledge in mathematics. You will learn in this book all physics topics as deeply as they are generally needed for a B.Sc. in General Sciences course, except you choose physics for your project, in this case you will need a further specialiced one for your project. Very important for me was also that it is very good for self-education."
1,Never even shipped my item and never returned any emails. Very poor seller.,"i ordered my item hoping to get it before classes started and it never even shipped. i've waited 3 week for the ""window of shipment"" to pass so i can buy from someone else. Seller never returned any of my emails questioning my item's status. Do not buy anything from this seller, it is a waste of your time and there are plenty of other sellers."
3,Excellent physics course book 4 stars,"(Sorry, my first review was on another book I received and I can not change the stars)This book is a physics course, from Richard Wolfson and very detailed brilliant with lots of pictures.R.Wolfson is a brilliant teacher on videos (e.g. the teaching company) as well.This book is rather an excercise book on physics fromgreetingsgiveandlive"
5,Good deal,I got a quick response to my email. Happy to do business with an organization doing some good in the community.
3,I agree,"I agree The Forbidden Planet and Five Million Years to Earth (AKA Quatermass and the Pit) are very good. It's been a long time since I've seen them, but they are both very clear in my mind.There is one thing...as a child I went with my parents to see the movie ""The Blob"" with a young Steve McQueen. Not the best movie in the world, if you see it today. BUT, the thing is, it all starts with a falling star. Can you imagine how I, and my sister and brother, felt when we came out of the theater and saw a falling star not more than five minutes later! Freaked the hell out of us then, and still makes me a little uneasy even today. I have to admit, I think my parents were sorry they took us to the movie that night. We, three, did not want to go to sleep that night!"
5,"How, Then, Shall We Live?","This is a wonderful book! It really has me thinking.How Then, Shall We Live?: Four Simple Questions That Reveal the Beauty and Meaning of Our Lives"
3,Couldn't find a connection,"I bought this book for a friend whose child was killed--and bought one for myself at the same time. In the intervening months, I have had serious family problems and hoped that the book might help me with a healing process. But then, I am just a regular person--no sexual or emotional abuse; just hurt. There's a condesending attitude in the spiritual part. It's sort of like, ""let me tell you about the how the African tribes handle things...and the beliefs of the Native Americans...and let me name-drop some celebrities while I'm at it...."""
5,Genius!,"What is better than learning physics from the giant in physics himself? The ideas in his lectures are so enlightening and well explained that it is a MUST read for anyone interested in physics, in despite of his or her technical background. Being a high school student, I have, nontheless, grasped most of his clear presentation. His explanation on quantum theory and the analogies he makes are just the best I've ever read. His lectures are, by no means, straightforward or ordinary. I have to read some parts twice or three time to fully understand what he is trying to convey. Keep in mind when reading it: This is a true genius talking."
5,Wonderful,"These are a collection of thought provoking lectures given by Prof. Feynman at Cornell University. Feynman briefly goes through the history of physical laws and brilliantly outlines their commonalities, ending with ideas to find new laws. In brief, its a short tour on the development of science in Feynman's style."
3,Not as good as the Feynman Lectures,"As a physics graduate student, I find this book not as inspiring and enlightening as I expected. The gravitation chapter is the best. The quantumn mechanics chapter is not clear. Feynman gave some interesting examples, but some examples are either too deep or too simple. Maybe this series is good for non-physicists. Or probably the audio version is better. That's all I have to say about this book."
3,physical theory,And such masterly attempt to explain the character of physical theory to the non specalist deserves every support and commendationno one need be in any doubt over the wonders of the world we live in scentifically speaking and here is a good chance to appreciate itG E STEDMAN'An orthodox understanding of the Bible with Physical science'
1,Audio Book - not original recording,"Ignore my rating. I have not listened to this tape. There are excellent Book&CD packs available with RPF's lectures. This however is only a spoken version of the book. It is not RPF. Thus, it was not what I was after."
1,what a dissapointment,"I have all the matt pond pa albums but for some reason I bought this one just recently and it sucks. All his cds have at least 4 goodies but this one hasnt one. How can this be the work of the band that created the masterpiece Emblems. Oh well, maybe i can save someone else the time and money i waisted."
5,Best Big Wheel Ever,I bought this for my son's 7th birthday. He is a big bike fan but that is gathering dust now that he has the electric scream machine. He can do 360's with no fear (from me) of rolling or flipping. It is a very stable and solid big wheel. I had a little trouble with the motor and Razor was awesome in getting me the parts I needed at no charge. We are very happy!
2,Always Needs New Tires.,"My son has had this toy for one year and we are on our third set of wheels. We would have needed more, but, it has needed to have the throttle switch worked on twice and now the battery is not charging even with a new charger. This was an expensive toy to have had so many problems. The body is constructed well, but, someone could have designed a longer lasting tire instead of the cheap plastic ones that it comes with. (...)."
3,Might be better for older kids...,"My one year old is very distracted by the busy pages. This book is not nearly so straightforward as ""Duck is Dirty."" Also, it is harder to tell what the animal is by the picture. It appears to be geared for an older tot."
1,Very Disappointed,"The theme music is not the standard that I think that we all remember. Only buy this video if you are into the early and I do mean early shows. See the list of shows posted by an earlier reviewer on this video. Maybe I should wait for the one that says the LAST 34 shows, now that one I would enjoy and at least the theme music would be the music that I remembered."
2,Warped Discs,"We bought this set at WalMart off the 2 for $10 shelf. The first set, we were able to get through about half of the episodes with no major problems (lots of small ones). The rest were not playable. We returned the set and exchanged it for a new set.We inspected each disc before playing and they looked okay, except for a few minor scratches on disc 4 from being loose in the case. After playing the discs, however, we saw new scratches in certain areas only and consistently, that indicated the discs were warped and were dragging in the player in the same spots each time around. This has not happened with any of our other DVDs. After one viewing that was the end of them, as the discs were too scratched to play again.We loved Bonanza the episodes we got to see (the Wagon Train bonus episodes were not really watchable, since the quality was so poor). Not so much bothered by the ""Spaghetti Western"" style theme music as much as by the lousy DVD stock that was used. Caveat Emptor!"
1,madacy quality,"I purchased a Madacy product years ago and found it to be of the poorest quality. It was so long ago, I don't remember. It may have been a music disc. The titles were all cut short. So it's no surprise they would make a lousy video as well."
1,The Worst of BONANZA & breech of copyright!,"These shoddy and pale bootlegs of BONANZA are a disgrace to a genuine fan of the series. They are in breech of copyright and fans don't even bother to buy them at the word a certain fan who thinks she is an ""expert"" who tells you otherwise.For the REAL DEAL, buy the Official Season 1 (2009) and Official Season 2, Vol. 1 (2010) by CBS Paramount and Best of Bonanza, Vol. 1 (2003) by Artisan.Bonanza: The Official Second Season, Volume OneBonanza: The Official First Season, Vol 1 & 2The Best of Bonanza, Vol. 1"
2,Not original theme music,The sound and picture quality is really good on these DVD's but doesn't have original theme song.
2,Disappointing in many respects,"While I was thrilled at the prospect of having so many Bonanza episodes at one time, the sound quality is poor on one of the discs despite turning the volume up all the way on the television, and there is much freezing and skipping. This is a poor tribute to a great series. The great Westerns like Bonanza and Big Valley (to name but 2), need to be available in high quality DVDs - by season. Big Valley has made a start in this direction and Bonanza needs to be available as well."
1,Terrible Quality,First time I have ever ordered anything off of Amazon and not gotten a quality product. The DVD doesn't even work.
1,bad bonanza cd's,"This cd is not as good as I would have like it. I'm able to watchone of the cd's. The other's does not play at all, I tried cleaningthe cd's, and I'm still unable to enjoy watching Bonanza. If there'saway I could get my money back I would appreciate it. Because the cd'sare not good at all sorry."
2,Don't waist your money!,The video quality is very mediocre. I can't imagine how anyone could watch an episode of Bonanza without hearing the theme song as those great characters are being intoduced. I love to watch repeated episodes of Bonanza but I was so dissapointed that I didn't watch more than one on this set. The Wagon Train didn't even come up. I'm donating this set of DVDs to Goodwill and I hope someone gets is for about 49 cents.
1,Worth the price- I guess,"Obviously made to sell cheap. They did not not pay the royalties for the Theme Song so there is some distorted, crappy public domain cowboy song instead. Video and sound are poor quality. Video does not translate on a blu ray player. On second thought, it's not even worth $10."
3,Not bad,I really enjoyed the Bonanza episodes. Takes me back to the good ol days. The missing theme song takes away from the series. Would have been 5 stars if the original theme song was included
2,BONANZA GOES BANANAS!,"What happened to the original theme music at the beginning & end? You will not find it here. And it bugs me so.The video & audio transfer is decent. Thank goodness I only paid $1.97 used for it. The DVDs & case are in goodshape. Buy it only until you can afford the REAL SETS. The bright side if any, is that you do get a healthyamount of episodes. That's why I gave it 2 Stars. And I feel that is being kind."
1,"Bad audio, Disks did not load, No soundtrack - Don't Bother","I was really looking forward to watching this with my sons.. But the problems with the disks, poorly synchronized audio, and lack of original soundtrack and opening score/scenes make this DVD a waste of time and money.. Fortunately more a waste of time as the cost was low.. The opening and soundtrack is an essential part of the ""Bonanza experience"".."
1,Do not buy this DVD!!!!,"Do not purchase this DVD. It is bogus! Counterfeit! Poor video quality, terrible audio quality and the music was not the Bonanza Theme. It is some sort of strange Chinese version which makes sense as this DVD was produced in Hong Kong. Again, do not buy this DVD."
1,Best of Bonanza (34 episodes),"This Is the worst DVD I have ever seen I have seen bad I have been collecting Movies for many many Years and all I have to say is Mill Creek needs to just give up and leave it to Shout Factory and Lionsgate to do the classic show releases. First Messing up 21 Jump Street and then Hunter and now Bonanza. All the classics need a good release not this crappy mill creek junk. The last thing I want to say isbuy the official DVD'SBonanza: The Official First Season, Vol 1 & 2Hunter - The Complete First Season21 Jump Street - The Complete First SeasonGod BlessMovie Man"
3,"Ok, I guess","It has some episodes that aren't on other collections, but it also had lots of areas where the dvd would freeze, could have been just my copy.Why can't they just start at season one?"
3,The listing is a misrepresentation!,"I love this movie and that is the only reason I am not returning it. However, the listing is false. The DVD does not contain and trailer or deleted scenes. It is the most basic of DVD's, with only a chapter selection and the movie. I'm sure this is the fault of Paramount and not Amazon.com. Just a warning to potential buyers."
5,VERY FUNNY!,"A friend recommended this movie to me. I never heard of it before. So I rented it at the video store. Wasn't sure if I would like it or not. But, I could not stop laughing. I Loved it, from the 1st second of it to the last. It was so funny! I could not get some of those lines out of my head. Every time I think about them; I laugh. Candy and Martin are perfect for this movie. I have watched lots of John Candy movies, And this is definatly his best. A Very Funny movie."
5,Gutbuster,While I've yet to see the DVD version of this movie let me just say that having seen it in the theaters I remember barely being able to breathe as I watched this highly entertaining picture! The only other picture that has come close to making me laugh this hard was KingPin! Rent it and try to watch it like any other movie...have no expectations and ENJOY!
5,HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!,"In honor of today being Thanksgiving, I thought I'd review this hilarious film! Steve Martin & John Candy are the perfect team. Neal Page is an advertising executive who is trying to get home for Thanksgiving. On the plane to Chigao, he chats with Del Griffith who is a sweet guy, but is very talkative and clumsy. They help each other get home, and nothing goes right. They are robbed and their car blows up. Will these two men make it home it time for Thanksgiving? I highly recommend PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES!!!"
2,Very Disappointing...,"I have been looking for this movie for quite some time...so I decided to order it. However, I was unaware there were different regions for movies, which was the case for this. It was never stated either when I looked at the description of the movie. Long story short, I am unable to watch this movie!"
4,CONFUSED,"WHEN I DON'T SEE THE SCENE ON THE PLANE WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR MEAL, I FIGURE IT IS DUMB EDITING SO TV CAN GET IN MORE COMMERCIALS, BUT WHEN THE SCENE IS DELETED ON AMAZON'S INSTANT MOVIE, IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE, I GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE, BUT WHEN I SAW THAT SCENE MISSING, I HAD TO STOP WATCHING."
5,Happy Thanksgiving Del Griffith,"It is difficult to say which is better - the 85 minutes of comedy that makes you laugh continuously or the 5 minutes of drama that will touch your heart. Undeniably Steve Martin and John Candy are at their hilarious best, but it's probably the latter that will have you pondering this movie long after the credits roll. I come back to it every year at Thanksgiving time - it is a very worthy addition to the many great Christmas season classics that follow. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is not only a great Thanksgiving movie, it is a perfect film to watch at this time of year because it reminds us of the true meaning of the season that follows."
5,PT&A is a Trip Worth Taking Every Thanksgiving,"First of all, PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES might just be my favorite comedy of all time. It's incredibly funny from beginning to end - and actually finds a way to throw in some heart-warming moments along the way. Steve Martin plays an advertising executive who is in a rush to get home to his wife and kids for Thanksgiving. However, a blizzard delays his Chicago bound plane and he winds up stuck in New York.He immediately crosses paths with John Candy (a shower curtain ring salesman), and the two set out on multiple misadventures. The film barely breaks the 90 minute mark, but you feel like you are on a wild roller coaster for a solid two hours. The fun never lets up and the emotional resolution is a fitting end to the movie. I'd like to say that this film is suitable for all age groups, however there is one scene that is rated [R] simply for repeated use of the ""f"" word. That scene also happens to be the best one in the movie, as far as I'm concerned."
4,Funniest Movie I've Seen in a Long Time,"I saw this movie last night on Cinemax and I laughed continually. I was trying to be quiet. My husband was sleeping. I couldn't sleep. I turned the TV on because movies usually put me to sleep, but this one didn't. I watched the whole thing. It was both touching and funny. John Candy and Steve Martin were great together. There were even times when I got teary eyed. I loved it."
5,Great purchase,"This is a great Holiday video, one of the best. It's so funny and heart warming. One movie you just have to see."
5,Where are your hands?,"This is a classic comedy movie. This is by far my favorite comedy of all time. John Candy as Del Griffith and Steve Martin as Neil Page make a great pair.I find that the movie is always funny, no matter how many times you watch it. It's a great movie to watch with friends. It does have some swearing in it so not great for the young kids.Great quote: Where are your hands? Between two pillows...those aren't pillows...."
3,A Good-Natured Buddy/Road Movie,"Out of all the buddy/road movies John Hughes made back in the eighties, ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" is certainly his best and most inspired. It's fast-paced and charming, with a lot of good moments.Steve Martin and John Candy are two of my favorite comic actors, and they have great on-screen chemistry together. There is some very funny and bittersweet dialogue between them, and, though much of the film is episodic, there are some unforgettable scenes, such as when Steve Martin blows his top with expletives at a car rental clerk, and when their car catches on fire.This is a fun movie to see any time of year, but especially around the holidays, with a poignant theme about families and togetherness."
5,FUNNY AND TOUCHING!,"Neal (Played by Steve Martin) is trying to get home to NY for Thanksgiving, because of a bad storm the airports are closed.He meets up with Del (Played by John Candy) who is also traveling and asks if he can help. Big mistake!You are taken on a semi-cross country trip as these two try to use every form of transportation to get Neal home for the Holidays.Neal cannot seem to shake Del, who has for reasons unknown until the end of the movie, decided to make it his quest to see that Neal gets home on time. There were many laughs in this movie, but I think for me the ending was what touched my heart and made it great. If you like Steve Martin and John Candy you will not want to miss this one. Humor, yet heart-warming. A very good experience!"
5,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles","This is a classic Thanksgiving movie to watch every year, it makes you laugh and cry at the same time, the performance of John candy and Steve Martin is superb."
5,Great Holiday Movie,Great movie that I had to have on Blu-ray. A holiday classic that we watch every year. Love the Holidays!
4,"Corny all the way, but heart-warming","I watched this 1987 flick for the first time today. Maybe it's because it was made 25 years ago and I personally have little memories of the 80s (or the decade before that), everything in the film seems corny, including the part where Del reveals what's up with his wife Marie! But the two actors do a fantatic job acting their respective parts, and the film turns out bigger than the sum of its parts! I liked the movie, to my own surprise. And it helps that it brings back memories of both NY and Chicago back in the 80s. How I miss those days, no cell phones, no in-flight entertainment, just people, even if rude people."
2,Too much profanity!,"Good story line but way too much profanity. Would not recommend for family entertainment. Would not have purchased had I realized how often the ""f"" bomb would be used."
5,"Lots of laughs, but...","If I could take out one scene it would have to be the one where Steve Martin drops the F bomb multiple times, but the Fast Forward button works on my controller;-) So we enjoy this movie often!! Hope you will too! >>>>>Can't beat the scene where John Candy gets his parka caught in the seat and the car careens out of control on the freeway!! Good stuff!!"
3,Excellent Movie with Lack Luster DVD,It seems most good 80s comedies are getting the same treatment. They are being released on DVD without any of the extras. This one isn't much different. Great movie but no behind the scenes anything. Wouldn't it be nice to sit down with Steve Martin and hear him discuss what it was like working on this movie?
4,Don't believe those highly paid critics on this one....,"I was amazed when I read the ""expert"" critiques on this movie. I thought it had great pacing, good humor, and unforgettable scenes. This movie is chock full of lines that are just begging to be recounted! Don't believe the critics...Judge for yourself."
3,"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles Review","I gave it 4 stars due to not having any problems with it whatsoever. The movie played without interruptions. The movie was clear with very slight digital problems. For slight problems that did occur, it wasn't anything noteworthy. The sound was okay. The volume fluctuated a little, but nothing noteworthy. All around, the movie was great; everything else was good.I would recommend the movie."
2,Where's the bonus stuff?,"I am a big PTA fan, it's my all time favorite movie. I was extremely disappointed in the DVD. It lacks any supplemental features such as outtakes, trailer, etc. What a dud."
5,"Fantastic movie , expensive bluray...Import instead!","Greetings to all my American friends ""from across the pond "" in sunny England. This is not a review of the movie itself as it's a comedy classic and everybody knows the story by now, but it's about the bluray. As a regular shopper of hard to find tv shows and movies that only you lucky people in region 1 land seem to get, from here on amazon, I noticed this extortionate priced bluray . If it's any help to anyone you can buy the UK region free version for only 13(around 20 USD) + shipping from amazon uk . And Its the same pillows edition as offered here, with deleted scene and interviews with John Hughes and retro interviews with Steve Martin, John candy. It's a great bluray. I hope this helps everybody."
5,Great Holiday movie,"Warm, funny and touching, all at the same time! Steve Martin and the late John Candy are wonderful together in this movie, and it never fails (no matter how many times it is viewed) to bring an emotional response. So glad this is available!"
5,The Two Semi-Trucks,"There are very few films that I have to have the remote nearby to place the movie on pause due to the side-aching laughter. These films include, ""A Shot In the Dark"" with Peter Sellers in the pool hall, ""Money Pit"" with Tom Hanks after the bathtub falls thru the floor and the third is ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles."" ""You are going the wrong way!"" This is after the (17), I presume bombs, Steve Martin (Niel) drops at the rental car fiasco only to be picked up by John Candy (Del) again. Besides the comedy and the unique possibility that this could actually happen to you(ever been caught in an airport layover for nine hours?) the movie is fulfilled with a very touching ending."
5,great price for a classic comedy,"I love this movie and that's all I wanted was the movie. I didn't need any extras, but it does come with an interview with John Candy, Steve Martin and John Hughes."
5,One of the Funniest Movies Ever Made!,"This is one of my all time favorite comedies. It will make you blow your favorite beverage through your nose. In my opinion, this would make a great family comedy if it were not for the string of ""f"" words in the one scene at the rental car counter in the airport. If they had used some other word other than the ""f"" word, then this could have easily made an excellent PG-13 movie. Our family watches this from time to time but I always mute the rental car counter scene. No matter how many times I watch this, it is always funny."
5,Amazon.com's Review,I just read the review by Amazon. He apparently has not watched this movie over and over and seen the great little details Hughes put in here. This movie IS a tradition movie and needs to be watched each year at Thanksgiving or Christmas to appreciate how little we have to complain about and teach us all to be more tolerant. There is a great message here and it is a hoot to watch with a few beers and friends.
5,Best Thanksgiving Movie,My husband watches this every year and our VCR tape died so it was great to find a DVD. Thanks
5,GREAT flick!,"This is one of my most favorite movies. John Candy is superb. There are sooo many great scenes; driving the burnt-out car, John Candy talking about his beloved wife, Steve Martin looking for his rental car and the hilarious following scene at the rental car counter to name a few. This movie will bring tears to your eyes, either from laughing so hard or from the moments that pull on your heart strings."
5,This movie has become our Thanksgiving tradition,"Every Thanksgiving our family watches P,T,& A. It goes with Thanksgiving just like turkey and the Lions game. Steve and John are great together, and this flick has many memorable scenes that will keep you howling with laughter. There's another side to this movie too, which is typical in a John Hughs comedy. There is a little heartstring tugging here, but not enough to bring the viewer down. When Steve goes back to the airport to see about getting his rental car, you may have to cover the kids ears, other than that, it's a great movie for the family.Watch for the cameo by Kevin Bacon as he races Steve for a New York taxi."
5,Thank You John Hughes!,"There's probably no better way to top off a Thanksgiving weekend then sitting down with friends or family and popping in this John Hughes' classic. Without question, this is one of the better road movies made in years (""Tommy Boy"" comes close).Someone needs to do a John Hughes retrospective someday on how he tapped into the American consciousness in the 80s. John Candy is at his best and Steve Martin shines brilliantly."
4,True Travel horror stories,"What can I say. ANYONE who travels a lot on business or for whatever reason has their own horror stories that make great cocktail stories years later. This is one long true travel story, albeit a little over the top, but not much. Many of us have sat next to or traveled with a ""shower curtain ring"" salesman, or some ""full of himself"" exec; had flights delayed, canceled, return to the same airport we just left; dealt with stolen or missing rental cars; ridden in pickups with the floorboards gone in January, etc, etc.Every Thanksgiving holiday we get together with 2 others families to watch it, tell travel stories, and commiserate with both John Candy and Steve Martin. In the end, we thank God we all finally arrive home, like Steve and John, and have a family to share it with."
3,Average,"This is a plain DVD. No special features, just the movie. Widescreen, Surround Sound. Good Graphics, but nothing special."
2,in Oregon,"I must have seen the tv version, I was shocked how many f bombs there were in this movie.I need to buy a ""cleaner"" version of this, still love the story"
2,2 stars for its (maybe) 2 laughs,"Long, drawn out and full of awkward scenes where John C's character, deprived of emotional/sensual gratification in his life presses himself onto Steve's char, in the bed, in the car, playing with his head. It was uncomfortable to watch.The pic on the cover accurately portrays the driving tone. Having seen J.C's work in the past I thought it would be funny but this one has a really strange premise.More of a drama than a comedy in my mind."
5,"Laughs, surely. But prepare to dab your eyes.","The background music and John Candy's face--his posture--in the train terminal was one of the saddest things I've ever scene on screen. The movie is certainly full of hilarious moments, but often what draws me back to watching it again is wanting to see this man's performance. He played so beautifully his character's contrast between depression and jovialness.Their male friendship became love, almost as intense as that shared between spouses. And BOY did they love their wives!I don't recall whether this movie was ever really adored as much be female viewers, but in any case, it's John Hughes' hats off...""To the wives!"""
2,"Great film, poor DVD version...","Steve Martin and John Candy are perfectly cast in this film about a straight-laced marketing exec mixed up with a bumbling salesman of shower curtain rings trying to fly home to Chicago from New York for Thanksgiving. We've watched ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" several times on TBS or USA network, and thought it was time to add a real copy to our video collection.This is a classic, modern holiday comedy unfortunately chopped up by Paramount. There are key airplane and hotel room scenes missing, and there are no extras on this DVD which I was expecting...is Paramount planning to put out yet another ""Director's Cut"" version? Only wished I had sorted through all of the reviews here for the DVD version before buying because now I want to re-sell it at a local store and purchase the VHS version...caveat emptor, indeed, for any future Paramount DVD purchases."
3,Airplane food scene not actually IN the movie,"I was so excited about what I thought was the uncut version of the movie. I was very disappointed when the movie went on without the airplane food scene. It is an ""extra"" on the disc. How hard would it have been to just splice it into the movie? The extras are good, but geez, let me know when they bother to actually put the scene in the movie instead of tacking it on in the extras."
5,Getting Home for Thanksgiving,This movie is very funny thanks in part to Steve Martin and John Candy who were the main stars and both of whom very funny themselves. That in itsself guarenteed that this was gonna be a good movie. Make that is one. This is the Thanksgiving version of Ill be Home for Christmas and they arrived just in time. Not to be a spoiler which technichally Im not because all movies like this end that way. Anyway as I said this movie is very good and funny. You should get it.
5,A Classic!,"I will always love this funny, funny, movie! I had to rent it for my grandson (11 yrs old). He also loved it!"
4,"Classic, worth the time",I haven't watch this in over 15 years and it was well worth the time to watch it again. It is a movie with humor that has a point and two actors who make me forget this is make believe.
4,Classic,I really like this movie and have watched it several times. I would buy it again and it does have several classic moments.
5,god bless john candy,"john candy puts on the best performance of his career. this move has it all. great cast, great comedy, great cameo appearances, great everything. its better than playing pick up sticks with your but cheeks!"
5,Great John Candy and Steve Martin movie,"What a great movie this is. One of the best of Martin or Candy. Too bad they didn't make another movie together.One thing about the ""deleted"" scene that some are complaining about in this film. That scene was NOT in the original theatrical release of the film. If you've seen the film on any of the cable channels (other than CBS) you will notice that the scene is not in those versions either. The missing scene was about 2 minutes more of Del Griffith and Neal Page on the airplane. The footage was obviously left on the cutting room floor for the original movie and was probably left in to fill out some of the scenes that were deleted for commercial television. At any rate, the DVD does contain all the footage of the original movie and those scenes that are in the VHS version. (Frankly, the missing footage was cut out of the original for a very good reason - it wasn't that funny).Great film. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of it.You won't be disappointed."
2,"Great movie, terrible language",We love this movie but the language was terrible. I really wish we could buy the tv version of this movie for the family
2,Disappointment,"This DVD is advertised as having bonus material, which is the only reason I bought it. It doesn't. If you already have the VHS, don't waste your money."
1,"5 for the movie, 1 for falsely advertising a deleted scene",LOVE this movie! Don't love reading on the package that there is a deleted scene and finding out there isn't.
2,nothing special,"I give this 2 & 1/2 stars. This movie had some amusing moments, but was definitely not as funny as I had expected, given that I had read the reviews prior to watching. If you want a funny John Candy movie, rent (or buy) Uncle Buck or The Great Outdoors or even Canadian Bacon."
2,Old Movie.....,"This was your typical old movie. It had great actors, a few funny scenes although this movie wasn't quite the holiday classic you would think it was going to be. Listen to the title because that is exactly what you are going to get with this movie...."
2,Dissatisfied,I could not play this movie on my DVD player. It must have come from a different country because none of my DVD players could read it. I was not happy with this product.
1,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles (Those aren't pillows edition)","The movie, as seen on TV is superb. However, this version has replaced the audio portion (the video seem the same as the TV version) with pure trash. I don't mind a little salty language, but this was embarrassing to listen to. I watched the whole movie, removed the DVD and placed it in the garbage can. The only good thing, I only paid 6.00 for it."
1,boring,people say that plains trains and automobiles is so funny people I agree with usauly touht it was so so funny but I thouht it was very bad and very boring but I think john candy and steve martin are very funny just not in this movie
1,What a groaner...,"This film was highly recommended to me by a friend, declared by him as ""the funniest movie I've ever seen."" He must've been drunk when he watched it. Throughout the whole thing you remain painfully aware that it's a movie, and everything looks contrived. They try too hard to be funny and it doesn't work. What it feels like is they take these two guys and put them in a variety of predicaments that are supposed to be funny and cause you to emit uproarous sounds of hilarity. Sadly, it falls far short of the goal. (About three miles in fact.) I don't think I laughed even once. The afore mentioned predicaments are not necessarily related to each other, and the order in which they are portrayed seems of no particular significance. My advice? Try ""Nothing to Lose"" instead."
4,for my fiancee,my soon to be hubby wanted this movie for our many camping trips every yr so he could watch movies in our camper. we bought it used and have not had any issues no scratching or freezing up or skipping. overall very pleased. we buy most of our dvds either here on amazon used or new ones here or walmart. its worth the money buying them on amazon even though used the play as good as new ones.
5,Love Cany,"Who doesn't love Candy, John Candy that is. And this movie has to be his best in my opinion. It has become a classic holiday movie and I like having it on hand to watch at my pleasure. No problems with ordering or shipping."
4,a little disappointed in the dvd,"this is one of my favaorite movies of all time,me and my wife watch it every year a few nights before thanksgiving and i was vey excited to purchase it on dvd this year.Although the quality in picture and sound is great, i am very disappointed that there are no trailors or deleted scenes.I have watched this movie when it is shown on cable,and there are a few additional scenes put in,one i can think of right away is an extra scene on the airplane.I was anticipating these scenes to be in the dvd or at least in an extra section,along with the theatrical trailors! i felt kind of cheated,but it is nice to finally have it on dvd, maybeb they'll put out a special editon PTA in a few years. with both versions on it, i would like to know what the deal is? i don't think i have ever seen a dvd without the trailors in it.anyway enjoy the movie and happy holidays!!"
5,Congratulating Candy and Martin on the greatest comedy ever,"This film cannot be described, it is truly stunning from beginning to end. It is absolutely hilarious but unlike most comedies it deals, splendidly, with the feelings of the characters and isn't just one joke after another. Martin's reaction in the rental car park when his car isn't there is priceless. This is, without doubt, John Candy's funniest film by a mile and I might add that his other films are very, very funny."
5,Wonderful Comedy,"This wonderful comedy incorporates what few films do--great humor with real poignancy. Steve Martin and John Candy are both superb, and together they are the perfect comedic pair. The plot is full of twists and turns, non-stop laughs, and moments of surprising tenderness. I loved this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone in the mood for an entertaining, funny, well-acted film."
5,"remarkably hilarious, one of the funniest movies ever.","A family tradition every thanksgiving. ""I knew I knew ya'"" ""Oh I thought it would be much worse than this, that'll buff right out"" ""we can laugh about it now"" ""THOSE AREN'T PILLOWS!!"" ""Two coins in a fountain... Flinstones, meet the flinstones"""
5,Another great one,"I seem to have a lot of favorite movies. This is my Thanksgiving favorite. Blu Ray gives such a sharp, detailed picture and the audio on this DVD is outstanding, as well."
4,Isn't this fun?,"This is the dress rehearsal for theAloha from Hawaiitelevison special. Some people prefer it to the ""official"" Aloha concert, but the concerts aren't actually all that different from each other. Elvis seems slightly more relaxed here, maybe too relaxed, he forgets some of the verses of ""Burning Love"" and ""Steamroller Blues"". The main difference is that this concert has two less songs than the other one. This CD includes three of the five special ""insert"" songs recorded for the American broadcast (the remasteredAloha From HawaiiCD includes all five of them). The ""insert"" songs include false starts and between song conversations, where the director gives Elvis instructions and Elvis expresses his annoyance at having to record these songs at 3:00 in the morning. This is a nice CD to have, but the remastered Aloha from Hawaii CD has better sound quality. Of course, ""real"" Elvis fans will want to have both concerts."
1,Sad,"This is a recording of the dress rehearsal for the concert from Hawaii the following evening.Presley's often off key and off-mike. He's tired, forgets lyrics, he's just running through the tunes and doesn't sound like he want to be there.He races through ""Suspicious Minds, is drowned out by the piano in ""My Way"", barely audible in ""It's Over"", does a sad fat Elvis self-impersonation of ""Hound Dog""He slurs like he's drunk or drugged on ""Fever"", ""I Can't help Falling in Love With You"" is so bad it's annoying, and all the audience screaming only makes it worse.The engineering is equally bad, with an audience mixed way too loud to create a phony sense of excitement for this pathetic performance.The actual concert the following evening was a masterpiece by engineered by the legendary Bill Potter.The notes makes outladish claims that this is ""A superb Presley performance from the acme of his career"", and that this is a ""truly extraordinary album"".Don't waste your money. It's a complete rip-off."
3,my conemara,"The book was fine and delivered quickly, my only complaint was that itwas signed by the author and someone took a sharpie and crossed out someof her words."
1,"I haven't seen this, but kathy lee gives me the creeps","Life is too short to waste on this kind of schlock. O.K., I haven't seen it so maybe I shouldn't say so, but you don't need to be nostradamus to guess that this is a pretty lame title. Give the money to charity instead."
3,Did Not Meet My Expectations,"After all the hype and reviews of this CD, I finally broke down and bought a copy used. I'm afraid I can't agree with most of the reviews here except the one that thought it resembled Dead Can Dance's 'Spirit Chaser', which it doesn't come close to. I found myself thinking about how boring this music was even though Ali's voice is fantastic and the musicianship is very good. I found very little innovation or insight in their music. Perhaps it lapsed into some kind of formula, but, nothing sounded as fresh and exciting as the work of Dead Can Dance which I believe are in a class by themselves. However, I think that Vas has potential, but, they must break out into something beyond what I've heard here. That would be a sign to me that this group is pushing itself, which at present, I don't feel."
1,Not good!,"This CD has a nice picture on the front cover but the music is totally lacking of devotion which is quite disappointing.Listen to Krishna Das ""Door to Faith"" and feel the difference!or any of his music!This CD from VAS is rated very good and I feel this is very misleading."
2,Gave it a few listens but....,"Like fingernails on a blackboard - the instruments, the singer's voice, the melodies."
1,misled!,"When I ordered this product,it was said to be 24pcs in the order. When only 1pc was delivered for the price,I was really upset. Guess that you have to lie in order to sell your product. Geeze!"
3,Lots to Love here,"In the mid 60s spy stories were riding the huge popularity of the James Bond films. Most were palid imitations of Fleming, but some like Leasor's Jason Love books managed to capture a little of that 'gee whiz' pulp excitement.Passport to Peril is the follow up novel to Leasor's ""Passport to Oblivion"" which had been made into a successful film ""Where the Spies Are"" starring David Niven as Dr. Jason Love, a village doctor who allows himself to be pulled back into the world of espionage with the promise of a priceless Cord automobile.""Passport to Peril"" finds Love helping out an old school chum who is the King of a small Himilayan kingdom. Leasor keeps the illogical plot rolling along with lots of action and a sprinkling of sex.Long out of print, it is only available in ebook format. The ebook version suffers from some bad formatting but hey when it's the only game in town...A nice taste of mid 60s spy fiction."
5,Great movie!,Arrived fast.Thanks a lot for the movie!It's a very good international movie.Great price.Highly recommended seller.Buy movie if you interested.You won't regret.
5,One of the all time greats!,"Love this movie! Good picture of life in Jerusalem for poor, religious people. Love the shots of homes and streets. Funny and touching."
5,Great movie for sukkot,My whole family loves this movie! It is great for Sukkot but for anytime of the year as well. You can become a different person and many times others who see us change can change as well.
5,what a surprise!!,"This is a charming, puzzling, film about two endearing people and the oddest couple of 'friends from the old days,' you'll ever meet. Somewhat like, ""Raising Arizona Meets the Sermon on the Mount,"" Ushpizin, has only a few flaws; and none of them spoils the fun or wipes the smile off your face."
5,Ushpizin,"Outstanding movie, that gets to the heart of being an Orthodox Jew in Jerusalem, but really gets to the heart of being human and overcoming obstacles and a dark past and coming out the other side. I have been showing this movie to 9th graders in a public high school in Maine and they get it and appreciate it and the movie is in Hebrew with English subtitles, never an easy sell to high school students. This movie should have won an Oscar for best picture."
5,"Realistic, thoughtful, and positive.","I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd. First off, it doesn't portray traditional Jews as ""ultra-orthodox"" lunatics, but as real people, with real problems. It's also a touching love story between a man and his (beautiful) wife, and what they have to go through to properly observe Sukkot, the Jewish festival of ""booth-dwelling"", which the Israelites first experienced upon exiting Egypt. Crazy ex-friends and some current wacky ones add to the story, which I found very nice. Two thumbs up."
3,pay new get old,the movie was great and everything i wanted for a program. but i paid the price for a new dvd and received something that looked all used. a broken case scratches ect... i mine as well of paid for a used one.Ross G
4,A must for those who like films about aspects of Jewish life,"This story focuses on an Orthodox couple who are so poor that they can't even afford a succah for the Succoth festival. Luckily, a donation helps them through that immediate crisis. Unfortunately, an even larger problem looms on the horizon. According to tradition, they aren't supposed to turn away guests who have no other place to turn. But what if the ""guests"" are willing to abuse the hospitality offered them? What if they are annoying and possibly even dangerous?I was entranced by this situation, watching a couple's faith being testing, as well as getting a glimpse into the Orthodox Jewish world. This is a film that anyone (of whatever religious belief or tradition) can watch. It is heartwarming, uplifting and inspiring."
4,Solid character study of a man torn between two very different sides of himself,"Intelligent, complex character study of small time hood with musical talent tryingto balance his hard and soft sides.A solid lead performance by Roman Duris, and some good supporting workaround him.Really nicely shot as well.But there was something a bit self-conscious, maybe even a bit sophomoric that keptme from flat out loving it. Still, I'd happily re-see it."
4,Wonderful Remake of Fingers,"This film is a remake of Fingers and better! Fingers was a film starring Harvey Keitel and directed by James Toback which has a cult following but was never considered that good. This film, The Beat that My Heart Skipped is a remake and immense improvement on the original. A young man with a businessman father who uses him to terrorize and wound people who owes his father money is still attracted to classical music and his late mother's life as a concert pianist. He decides to attempt to audition for a performance while continuing his day job. How does punching people affect your hands and fingers used to play piano? The star tries to improve his piano with a Vietnamese-Chinese female teacher who doesn't speak French. The love of the music transcends the language barrier. A very interesting French film."
1,Don't buy this from Amazon,"This is an excellent film which I highly recommend, but don't buy it from Amazon. I did and found that every few minutes a large title appeared on the screen saying ""PROPERTY OF WELLSPRING"". I returned it and got a second copy. On the shrinkwrap was a sticker saying ""WELLSPRING'. I returned it without opening it; it seemed obvious that it would have the same problem. I am astounded that Amazon is selling videos that were apparently made and labeled for some private organization."
3,Narcissism unleashed !,"The story at the beginning is an interesting tale of how a poor black share - cropping family from Louisiana persevered to produce a sharp young lawyer who was not afraid to take on the establishment, particularly the corrupt LAPD. Unfortunately, after the midway point the story and perhaps his life, deteriorates into a name -dropping, globe - hopping social whirl which I imagine should do little to endear him to the poor, suffering fellow African - Americans that he purports to agressively defend. One of those poor downtrodden people of course being O. J. Simpson."
5,Cochran will get you thinking about the judicial system,"Heard the taped version of JOURNEY TO JUSTICE,written and narrated by Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr. . . . I thoughtI had heard ALL I wanted to ever know about the O.J.Simpson case, but I was wrong . . . Cochran's storygot me to rethink the verdict again, and he makes somecompelling points about why the prosecution was notable to prove its case well enough to get a guiltyconviction . . . I particularly liked some insidedirt that I had not heard before; i.e., how RobertShaprio nearly blew the case for the defense . . . Cochranalso got me to think about how minorities have beentreated throughout time with respect to the judicialsystem . . . I feel I got to know him better as a resultof listening and one thing is for sure: he'd be on thetop of my list if I ever needed a criminal attorney!"
4,"read the ex-wife's book, too.","This was the book that started me off on OJ-iana. The guy is slick! It compelled me to compare his version of ""facts"" against everyone else's. And, more than Chris's book, or Marcia's book, or Bugliosi's book, or the ""friend's"" dad's book, what I remember is the ex-wife's book. I thought she did a great job with what seemed to be a tawdry premise. Her modest little book ought to be sold as a companion volume to Johnnie's vanity printing."
1,Try and stomach it.,"Johnnie Cochran is, simply, an appalling human being. He represents the worst type of person society in this day and age has to offer. He knew his ""race card"" would singlehandedly help change perceptions of black and white relations with each other and with the police for the WORSE, and he smilingly played it. Quite possibly, he helped take race relations in this country a step back. I find it impossible to have an ounce of respect for him."
1,What A Waste of Paper!,"The only thing this clown is famous for is busting out with a clever rhyme that convinced 12 of the dumbest people in the world to 'acquit' a known killer. Don't waste your time with this book. There are plenty of Mother Goose books out there if your pursuing fairy tales and nursery rhymes. If you enjoy this book, you'll also love the unabombers manifesto. He too, was on a journey for justice.jrobertson30@yahoo.com"
4,Sounds like a good time...,"I've never really been a big Hornsby fan. I was familiar with the singles and liked them, but he remained under my radar. But I kept catching him in performances on TV and thought, ""This guy is an outstanding talent."" So when I saw this one I figured this would be a great opportunity to hear him cut loose. Well, that's exactly what he does on this double set. A true Hornsby fan could give you a better breakdown of how this compares to his other work, but from a newcomer's standpoint, this is an excellent example of a multi-talented musician who doesn't limit himself to a sound; he blends rock and jazz into an amazing package. Not a five star for me as he occasionally overindulges on the free form jazz, but this is a nice listen. Crank it up a bit to really appreciate where Hornsby is willing to take his music."
4,"Hornsby live, finally!","If you've seen Bruce live, this album will evoke fond memories of his energetic, care-free concerts. How many artists encourage anyone from the audience to dance with them on stage? These CDs are a great portait of one of the great performers of our time. From the radio friendly pop tunes, to more jazzy numbers, to Grateful Dead covers, Bruce delivers in his own, downhome style."
3,Caution-,"There are two things that potential readers need to be aware of. First, that the author has been diagnosed as Bipolar II. There is a difference between I and II, so if you happen to be Bipolar I, do not expect to read about the extremes that you may experience. Second, this author comes from a Christian perspective. This is great if you happen to be a Christian; otherwise, you might find his references to God/He/Jesus rather annoying. I do have to note that the physician,Gerald Nelson, portrays a pleasing demeanor that makes reading his comments enjoyable. Therefore, if you are a Christian with Bipolar II, go for it. If you are not, borrow a copy before you buy one."
3,A good summary of typical support groups. Too expensive!,"This book is good, however, I wish that it had more information from the doctor. No two bipolars are alike. It did help my understanding of my mood disorder. The book was a bit on the expensive side, but obviously, I bought it anyway."
1,Will not do what it is advertised to do.,"It appears there is a major disconnect between engineering, marketing, and production at Stanley. This is advertised to have, ""Automatic hold-open feature"" and ""Controlled latching power."" Neither of these features exist on this Item Number device. Their stock photos do not resemble the product sold at all. It may work well as a standard closure, but do not expect the specially advertised features."
1,Absolutely dreadful,"I read this book getting on ten years ago now and my abiding memory is one of pain. It is a horrible novel, with flimsy characterization, impenetrable turn-of-the-century Midwestern slang and a plot that moved so slowly whole civilizations rose and fell. Some writers can do beautiful things with the English language. Richard Peck isn't one of them."
1,Not very funny,"Stoners might like it, no one else would. I was a Nat Lamp fan 35 years ago, but this is a sub par collection."
4,good workout bad dvd,"I was so excited to get this dvd. However, once I put it in my dvd player and got a bad disc error I was soooo upset! I can only play this dvd on my laptop, which is very frustrating. When you sell an item please make sure the disc is good, so that no one else will have this problem. On the bright side the workout is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! You sweat like you are at the gym, but its fun because you are dancing. I would suggest this dvd to individuals that have rhythm and that are able to pick up dance steps quickly. Love this workout."
4,Samba Reggae is great workout,"I exercise before work every morning and needed a new routine. I had been alternating between Turbo Jam, my own step aerobics routines, and jogging. I've taken Zumba classes so I thought this might be a nice change. I loved it! If you like to dance, this is a good workout. Even the Workout #1 which shows you how to do everything and repeats the routine several times, is good once you know all of the steps. The Workout #2 is a quick 7 minute routine that I do after crunches, lunges, and pushups.I just wish there was more than one routine on the DVD. I definitely recommend it."
2,Can't recommend it.,"A couple of things wrong with this workout. 1) Ribeiro is obviously a professional dancer and I felt I needed to be one to follow the steps. 2)She was wearing a mic but unfortunately it was not working so her instructions were coming in on the same mic that was recording the bongos & drums of the guys playing in the background, the result was that she was very hard to hear and turning up the sound also turned up the drums. 3) Finally, it wouldn't be good long term because if you did learn the steps, then you would be very annoyed with the long, built-in ""here's how you do it"" segments. I watched once--probably won't watch again."
4,The Samba Reggae Workout,"This video is fun but I feel some of the moves are difficult to master. It is a great workout though, really works up a sweat. In my opinion she uses too many moves therefore it is difficult to follow. However, for the money it was well worth the product!"
4,Good Workout,"I've been wanting this workout for a long time. I finally got an Amazon gift card and decided to purchase. It is fairly easy to follow, and it truly is a workout. I do however, feel like there is something missing..."
3,Not so good for the knees,I bought this DVD based on the good reviews. However this DVD is not for some with problem knees. I also found the moves somewhat repetitive. Somewhat disappointing DVD.
1,unreceived,i ordered this item in oct and still am waiting to receive it. i am not a satisfied customer.
2,Not what I hoped for,The dances in this video are either too slow or too fast. It wasn't as enjoyable as other latin dance videos.
2,Expected to love it too- but didn't!,"Here's the good: this IS a true workout, and its easy to follow the steps. The bad however: the drum beat gets tiresome and the quality of the DVD (lighting, staging, etc.) is very poor & amateurish and therefore distracting.I have many dance DVDs as dancing is my preferred workout and as much as I expected to like this (because of the many other positive reviews of it!), I didn't. I just didn't feel the same sense of fun and enthusiasm I feel with my other dance workouts!"
5,I loved it!!!,Dance Today! Samba - Active Lifestyle MakeoverI decided to purchase this DVD ( Samba Reggae) after I purchased Quenias first DVD ( Samba from Rio De Janeiro) and I gotta say really enjoyed this DVD. I am a dancer and personal trainer and I believe this has to be one of the the most thorough workouts on a DVD that I have experienced . There is a good warmup before the routine ( something that a lot of my excercise and dance DVD's lack) and then there are 2 versions of the same choreography ( the slower instructional section and the full throttle routine). It's best to do the 2 routines back to back. There is live drumming by 5 drummers in the DVD and the instructor is accompanied by 2 dancers. Their enthusiasm and energy is contagious. Having been to Salvador Bahia Brasil I can also tell you that the music and dance is both creative and authentic ... Good job !!! and 2 thumbs up for this oneAxe
2,comment,The music was only drums which played almost the same sound thru ought the exercise which does not inspire. Was disappointed.
2,low quality and boring workout,"I am a newly engaged 29 year old woman who is trying to lose weight for my walk down the aisle. I bought this dvd because i was sick of all of my other workout dvds and wanted something similar to zumba. first of all the sound quality was really bad. You could barely understand or hear the instructor. the whole workout is like learning a dance. you slowly add in each section and periodically run thru the dance, until you've learned the whole thing. There is only one dance on the dvd. I thought i would love this but was sadly disappointed. I thought it was boring and didn't get my heart rate up."
1,Waste of money,"No typical instruction don't like it, of course it is supposed to be a dance workout video. It was just basically drums with a dancer and her back up dancers."
2,The Samba Reggae Workout,This may be highly overrated! The routines are not ones that are easily done and not a very good workout.
2,instructional dance routine,"this is not a workout dvd. don't get me wrong the dance instructor is awesome, very energetic and fun. she spends to much time trying to teach the steps and repeats it over and over again (stopping and starting). it was so tiresome and frustrating. this is an instructional dance techniques video. in order for it to be a true workout dvd, the routine should last more than about 3 minutes. i wasted my money on this (and i hate wasting my money). DO NOT purchase this dvd if you are looking for a true aerobic workout. if you want to learn afro/latin dance steps then this is the dvd for you."
2,Samba Reggae,"This was purchase for a gift. It was not the quality, nor was the instruction done very well. You can't hear the instructor over the music. Too bad you can't return an DVD that you will never use."
2,Dance tape disappointing,"I was disappointed with this DVD. The music was all drumming, which did not keep me motivated to exercise. Based on the title, I expected some reggae music. The dancers were good, but not very high energy or motivating. I returned the DVD for a refund."
2,It does not get your heart pumping,"This routine is good because you can learn the basic moves of samba...but its not like a workout. You need a lot of space too to do all the moves, which doesn't work in a NY apartment. But she's a good instructor. I would recommend something else though if you really want to get your exercise done in a fun way. Just a thought"
2,not done in professional way,"i was dissapointed with this video, its not in a professional manner. Theres alot of distraction with the musicians and the drums are too loud."
5,Ever fell in love with a textbook?,"I sure as heck never had before. I am dyslexic, math phobic, and a graduate student in Psych who must take 1 full year of advanced stat. Terrifed of this prospect, I bought this book. It is, without doubt, the best text book, ever. It is funny (to the point of being downright cheeky), laid out exceedingly well, progresses from one idea to another naturally, and explains all these confusing concepts easily. I actually looked forward to reading it in my spare time, and I promise you, I am not a math geek! There simply is not a better Intro to Statistics book out there. Better than cartoon guide, stats for dummies, etc. Save your money and time and go right to the source."
5,"Exquisite, peaceful","I don't come from an Anglican or ""high church"" background, but this CD is simply amazing. If I walked into a cathedral or sanctuary on a Sunday morning with this kind of music going, how could I not fall down and worship? Simply gorgeous."
5,Mystical and lyrical!,"Susan King is a real voice in historical romance. I loved this book, and found it compelling. She is on my ""A"" list of authors!"
5,Love all of Leigh Greenwood's books!,All of the books in Leigh Greenwood's Cowboy Series are just wonderful and this book is no exception. Very enjoyable reading and each book makes you eager to start the next one in the series and sigh in disappointment when the last page of the last one is read.
3,Ladies of the Night,"Zeke and Hawk are returning to the ranch with their broodmares and stumble on a wagon with four ladies of the night. They cannot leave the ladies out there on the trail. This is an interesting and entertaining situation. Greenwood takes you on a trip with all these ladies through the wilds of the old west. Are there some attachments made along the way? Read it and find out what happens. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
2,The Mavericks,"Two couples that don't want love find each other on the lonely plains of the Old West. Zeke and Hawk both felt too outcast because of their heritages to ever find a woman who could look past that to love them; and Josie and Suzette were dancehall girls. Their past was not one that made for wives. Yet, once the two groups meet, neither can get the other out of their minds. They try, but when trouble forces them to reunite, they find love leading them home.** There is actually very little coherent or cohesive plot here to engage one's attention. The narrative seesaws from one to the other jaggedly, focusing mostly on angst, not romance. The friendships portrayed are noteworthy and heartwarming, but that is not enough to commend this tale as readable. **Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer"
5,This lets the small church sing to a great background sound.,"We use this and all the other chorus and hymn volumes we can find to lead us in our music worship every Sunday morning. By turning the balance to the background side, we can have a full orchestra accompaniment for each gospel song and hymn we sing. We no longer like to sing accapella after using these great CD's. I hope they will make more of them. It really enhances our worship services and it's easy to follow the music."
4,Great Product,"Whether the actual benefits are real or placebo, I have to say I'm satisfied. I did not buy this on Amazon, but at Home Depot. I wanted the full sized filter, but H.D. only had the slim line, which has turned out to be just fine. I do notice the absence of the chlorine smell in my shower, and my skin and hair definitely feel less dry.I am no chemist; nor do I have any equipment to test the legitimacy of Sprite's claims. However, I'll take their word for it, as at least the nasty smell of swimming pool is gone, and even if there's a bit of placebo going on in my head, It's nice to have one less thing to worry about in the morning."
1,Cartridge replacement sucks,It is worst filter as it is practically impossible to get it open to replace the cartridge.
3,water pressure is low compared to the high-output models,"This filter is okay if you don't mind low water pressure. I just recently switched to sprite's high-output version, and my water pressure increased by at least 50%. The inch or so space you save between the filter and the showerhead just isn't worth the loss in pressure, in my opinion."
4,Seems to do the job,"I bought this filter at Home Depot last week and it seems to work. My skin is not as dry and neither is my hair. My hair does feel cleaner and softer. Installation took all of 5 minutes, that package included a small amount of Teflon tape; enough to do the job. It only installs one way so it would be very hard to make a mistake. For $20 it was worth trying and I am glad I bought this product."
3,Not a 2 pack,"This is definitely not a double pack, it is a filter and the plastic housing. Very misleading! The description needs to be corrected. I was expecting 2 replacement filters, not what I received.Sprite Slim Line Filter Cartridge 2-pack"
1,Not at all what arrived,"I did indeed order filter cartridges to fit my existing filter. I was online today confirming that fact because today the order arrived. It was a whole new filter. Our crappy water supply will go through this filter in a matter of weeks, which is why I wanted two filter cartridges....so I didn't have to do this goose chase again. Amazon will not be where I find my next filter cartridge."
2,Not a two pack.,When will amazon change this description? It only has one replacement filter in it and nothing else. One of the big box stores sells a single replacement filter for much less $.
5,dont miss this!!!!,"Evan Margolis and Moira Denike are amazing and a very volonte Costa Rican! I love the way they systematically explain each and every move step by step and even the most difficult moves they make it simple for you. I've watched other DVD's before but nothing fascinated me as this DVD has and the whole package is totally awesome that you get so glued to it n leaving it behind becomes painful. I'm so attached to this DVD that I wana watch it everyday and dance with all my heart and energy no matter how tired I am. It just takes you to a far away place where it's just you, music and salsa.Go for it people. You don't wana miss something great!"
1,Too Pricey and nothing to write home about ...,"This is a very mediocre Salsa Dance DVD and the price is too high. For starters, the colors used in filming this DVD are very depressing and this guy (the instructor) would not shut up ... you can't even hear the music. All you hear is one two three, one two threee ..."
5,The Instruction I was Looking For (needed)!,"Turns out that the first couple weeks were the hardest for me. (Took me 3 weeks of regular practice with DVD 1 to get the basic step.) I recently mastered this second DVD and figure that by the time I finish the third, I will finally feel confident about my dancing.I have no doubt that my progress is because of the great instruction given on the DVDs and the fact that the methods used in the first DVD are the same as in the second and in the third. It's like a real teacher where once you get used to their method, you know what to expect and how to adapt.I always wanted to dance but time after time I thought I'd proved to myself it just wasn't my thing. Salsa (and these Salsa Crazy DVDs) have shown me that I had the dancing gene inside of me the whole time...just needed the right instruction to bring it out. Thanks Salsa Crazy."
1,Doesn't work in all devices,"I bought the Magicstor plus 2.2G drive for my Maxxum 7D and it does not recognize it. Be sure your device or camera is compatable. Do something I didn't, Google this card and see how many people are having problems with it. I wish I did that before buying it."
3,Action Comedy Worth Seeing!!,"Chow Yun Fat plays an experienced & some what arrogant cop to Conan Lee's rookie cop. The movie does have some Lethal Weapon themes, but I don't remember Danny Glover getting scared enough to wet his pants. If you are a Hong Kong cinema fan you won't be disappointed.If Conan Lee looks familar to you Jet Li fans, its because he played Mr. Li's brother in LW 4."
4,"Original sources, not for everyone","I have good news and bad news. The good news is that this book is outstanding. The bad news is that it is NOT for everyone. From my perspective as a former Khmer linguist with the US Military I remember the beginning of the Pol Pot era, the ""strange"" messages we began to intercept from the mysterious and scarry ""ankar,"" and most of all, I remember following the genocide in the news during the '70's and wondering ""how could this happen in such a gentle society as Theravada Buddhist Cambodia?""This book, which lists hundreds of Khmer sayings during the Pol Pot era in both English and in Khmer, is like an injection of ice-water. I read and shivered. There are several editorial mistakes but remember that the original was written in French and translated into English with the Khmer equivalent also provided. The book took me back 30 years. I believe this book will prove to be a valuable source far into the future despite its niche appeal."
2,Cool and uncool,"5 stars for compilation & translation.1 star for interpretation & opinion.Nothing more boring when an author hates & loathes what he writes about, and uses every chapter to prove it."
4,Great book,"I loved this book! I am doing a project on Native Americans and it helped a lot. The craft instructions were a little hard to understand as it was not really geared toward kids, but the projects were very authentic (not to mention fun!) and I wholly recommend this book."
5,Best ever soy powder,"I've tried many soy protein powders, and this is far and away the best. I mix it with soymilk and sometimes a little fruit and drink it nearly every morning. It has a pleasant taste (I use the vanilla), doesn't clump, and has a nice consistency as well. I'm never hungry before lunchtime if I drink it along with my usual egg or oatmeal. My local health food store stopped carrying it, and I was very excited to realize I could get it from Amazon."
1,map review,"this map is outdated. many trails that are indicated on this map are not existing anymore. please use caution before using it and check before using. the main trails that are not in use is the one that is going from Lower Wright lake to-the one going from summit lake to lower wright lake (a portion of it is non existing making that part of the loop impossible. )-the one from summit lake to elk lake is also non existant.the only way to get from summit lake to the north part is through Rock Creek Valley and reconnect to the trail going to Elk lake, Deep Lake and Lower Wright lake.so Beware."
2,phto shoot,"product very poor effort at movie production.. designed for adult viewers in anfoolish attempt to appear professional,ends up a comedy joke"
1,Very weak hold,This so called Sport gel with Ultimate hold is pretty much like just having water in you hair! I'm going back to the regular Ultimate hold #9 or higher
4,Dep Gel Great for Curly Hair,"I have been using Orange dep gel in my hair for at least 10 years! They have slowly stopped selling it in all the stores in my area. Recently the last store I knew that carried it have discontinued it, therefore I have to now buy in online. It works great for my naturally curly hair and holds the curl. It does get a little crunchy but not so bad if you diffuse it. Thanks for selling it on Amazon!"
5,U Can Never Get Enough Prince,"I loved the Girl 6: Music From the Motion Picture CD. I ordered it primarily for Vanity because I had forgotten the other terrific songs on this soundtrack, including ""Pink Cashmere"" and ""Erotic City."" If you like sexy and danceable, you will ""Adore"" this CD."
3,Girl6 Soundtrack,I bought this cd only for the Vanity 6 song which I could not find anywhere else. FUN!
5,Grooving soundtrack!!!!!,"Every song on the Girl 6 soundtrack is hot. A few of my favorites would have to be Girls and Boys, Nasty Girl, and Erotic City. Prince certainly knows how to make interesting songs. A must have soundtrack for your collection."
5,Last Prince,Forget Purple Rain this is the best album prince has given to date.The crazy lyrics alone are a good enough reason to get this album.Prince combine a AlGreenishEarlyRickJamesCameo F.U.N.K. to this album that all the big artist like Alicia Keys and D'Angelo to name a few have sampled.If you have any soul at all Prince will pull it out take it to dinner and run it though a meatgrinder all before you get to the fith track.
3,Just your average Prince,"Girl 6 is pretty much your average soundtrack. Basically everything here has been done before. The new songs ( ""She Spoke 2 me"", Don't talk to Strangers"" and ""Count the Days"") are well received songs, but can't stand up against what's already been stamped and sealed. Girl 6 is a great addition to any collect and is great to listen to (right after the movie)."
2,PocketPeeker Disapoint,"Overall the BarKeeper Pocket Peeker does have most usefull drink mix recipes for the average consumer and bartender, however, the size, shape and construction of this small ""booklet"" does not compromise the value. The book is held together with one small ring loop, and is quite hard to use as a quick reference guide if ti was in someones back pocket as it seems to be for. Even the pocket-knife bottle opener that the picture shows in the advertisement is not the same as the one shipped. The bottle opener has no knife and I could have bought the opener at any store for 25 cents. Dissapointed."
5,Great basic pocket book,"Great mini pocket book for all servers/ bartenders, or even people who want to throw mini cocktail parties at home. No pictures or anything, just a basic recipe for all kinds of cocktails you can imagine. It comes with a little bottle opener, what a neat idea. It might not have all new fancy drinks you see on HBO shows, but for the basics, this is what you need."
4,"Practical, No Frills Guide","This guide presents all the major drinks in an easy to read guide that fits discretely into your back pocket -- a nice helper for new bartenders. Unlike those big books that would be embarrassing for a bartender to thumb through in front of a customer, one can discretely pull this out while turned away from a customer and quickly confirm drink ingredients. This guide does not contain recipes for hip new drinks, but is good on the basics and a helpful backup to new bartenders."
5,happy camper,"The product is very good and so was the service! The product arrived quickly, very impressive . I had used this product before, so I knew I was going to like it."
3,Gio's solos shine,"I thought album was going to have more excitement, althought no a uperb album it is a solid work. Goivanni Hidalgo solos gives excitement to the album."
3,Leaves out some of his best nudes,"Egon Schiele remains one of my favorite artists. ""Nudes"" does have some excellent pieces included but should have been far more inclusive, since Schiele has such an extensive portfolio to draw from. Too many sketches that are only interesting because of the artist who drew them. This book is worth having if you're a true Schiele fan. However, I would strongly recommend ""Schiele"" by Wolfgang Georg Fisher if you want a more rounded perspective and those other nudes that should have been included here."
3,"Fun to read, like so - so si fi","This book was a fun read that is if you don't care about scholarship. Reading this book is like listing in a Sunday school class where two smart guys speculate about a lot of stuff that sounds cool, but it doesn't go much further than that. Many of their conclusions are improbable, and their so-called factual basis in ancient scripture to support their claims is only their private interpretation of those scriptures. They take a quote from some manuscript and interprets its meaning to support their idea, but the same scripture could be used to support another claim by another smart person too. Nevertheless, if you like reading spiritual/historical speculation this is the book to read."
1,The Ark of Millions of Years,"The Ark of Millions of Years: New Discoveries and Light on The CreationThis book is way off, the author believes that God came from a grand counsel of gods that appointed him the creator of heaven,earth and man.WHAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,not very helpful,"I got this book when I was first getting into minis, though Ive had big horses for a long time. There really wasnt much info in here specific to minis, aside from a short breed history, and a few pictures. It seemed to be more a general horse care book, which I already have plenty of! I would not suggest this book if your looking for info specific to minis, but its okay if your new to horses of any size and need to learn general info."
2,dissapionted,"I was unhappy with this book. I bought it expecting to learn about things mentioned in the title.I read the whole book and there is no real mention of training, except training for the blind. It gives a very vague topic of showing, and being new to miniature horses I was hoping to get a good idea about how shows are conducted.If you just want a narrow view of the topics you might like this.But if you're like me and want to actually learn about the topics listed in the title, I wouldn't recommend this to you. I returned my copy!"
5,very informative,This miniature horse book has all the info anyone would need. It tells you everything step by step. I knew nothing before I read it and now I feel as though I might know everything about a mini.
2,Uncomfortable straps,"I bought the 38B and it just doesn't work for me. Though I love the color (Toffee), the fabric, the comfort of the cups (which are molded), and the flattering cut of the cups, the straps on this have a terrible design. The adjustable feature stops right at the top of the shoulders, and there the fabric is sewn together so that underneath the straps, directly against your skin, are scratchy bumps where the fabric is stitched together. These leave my skin red and irritated. I'm not sure why the straps on this bra are designed this way because it is very uncomfortable. Very disappointing because the reviews on many sites made this bra sound like an excellent choice for everyday comfort."
2,bandwagon material,"Having followed miss Rebecca since her first album, I was disappointed in this one. She was just getting established into the light rock alternative scene, but Transform jumped head-first onto the current pop-dance bandwagon. At times I thought I was listening to the typical uncreative Britney album. The production of the album and it's attention to detail was good, which has only been getting better each album. Unfortunately Transform seemed too limited vocally and musically. Many of the songs tended to blend together and sound alike. Lyrically the album was solid, but the music did little to accent the song's mood. I was disappointed to see Rebecca jumping on the secular bandwagon of current trends. Perhaps that is why this album was called Transform?"
5,Danceable and Happy!,"I had never heard of RSJ until I heard ""Reborn"" and ""Don't Worry"" on the radio. I was immediately hooked. I love her edgy, upbeat sound and the lyrics are great. I'll be looking forward to getting her next CD!"
5,This is a rockin' CD!,"I am a music fanatic, bluntly put. I have SO MANY CDs! And this one, Rebecca St. James 5th album, is one of my all time favorites. Its unique and rockish tunes mix with the hearfelt and honest lyrics to create a musical masterpiece. The songs are very uplifting and totally AWESOME! You will love this CD, I guarantee it!"
5,Different,I liked this a lot. I don't like all her stuff. Sometimes her voice gets on my nerves. But this CD is very good techno-rock with a great Christian message.
1,Small Chairs,Please be sure and understand that the chairs are very small. They almost look like they could be for a child's room.
1,"Color doesn't match photo, poor quality","Color is darker than expected...reddish orange and doesn't match photo. Construction is poor quality. Assembly is easy, but I have low expectations. Seller deleted feedback when I ranked their product accuracy as part of their review. In my opinion, this is not a reputable company if they sell a shoddy product and try to delete unfavorable reviews."
1,DON'T EVER BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE,"The chair color as displayed is much lighter than the actual product (the chairs I received are nearly red in color). The chairs are extremely poorly made; many of the spindles spin freely as the holes are too big for them. I wasted several hours trying to return the chairs, to include a needless trip to UPS, and wasted at least ten dollars on packing tape to repack the chairs - all this because these people made it sound like they were going to pay for the return shipping. Then they came out and said I'm responsible for paying the return shipping. Sp I'm stuck with these things and had hours of my time wasted as well. These people are a disgrace and I hope they go out of business soon."
1,cheap and uncomfortable,Well...they look nice but are very uncomfortable and fall apart easily. We were looking for inexpensive chairs to replace old set and these probably were all we would get for the money - do not recommend at all.
4,Decent Purchase,"I received the chairs pretty fast. directions weren't too much help.. i ended up doing my own thing. however, once together, they're pretty nice. they match my oak dining table very well. they are a smaller seat. if you have bigger hips/ butt, the sides cut you. took me a little while to get used to that. 2 of my chairs had a couple dents in the seat, and the other two, have black marks on the back arch of the chair, almost like burn marks. the bottom feet of the chairs are pretty rough and don't slide easy on carpet. i may put the felt toppers on the feet to help them move better. i think that for $100 they're a pretty decent purchase."
2,Do not last much! Buy something else if you are looking for long term usage,This chairs look excellent. It was pretty easy to assemble. Recently I observed that chairs started shaking.Well! You would get what you pay for!!!!I would not recommend this to anyone if you are planning for long term.
2,Barely Lasted a Year,"You do get what you pay for, and these were wicked cheap. They seemed sturdy at first, then started to wobble within a few months. I added extra glue, which helped for while, but eventually even that gets loose, and now one of the chairs lost its leg and it is not repairable."
4,almost perfect,The scope mount works great. The only drawback is the height that the scope sits now. But with the new mount I can mount any scope I want onto my Barnett RC-150.
2,We need better quality camera work on the documentaries.,"The print of ST3:The Search For Spock is good but there are some disappointments with the extras. For example,the camera work done in interviews with Nimoy and Shatner on disc 2 look as if they were done by hopeless cameramen. The shots are ridiculously close,almost up Nimoy's nose! Why didn't the ""cameraman"",for want of a better word,have the commonsense to pull the shot back? The average amateur could do a better job with his homemade videos. What is it with Paramount that they aren't doing a professional job on the extras? The same thing happened with the interviews on ST2 and now we have pitifully amateurish camera work on this DVD. This is not good enough.The DVD also does have some good photos but no deleted scenes."
2,Why not some extras Paramount?,"I have around 60 DVD's and I am a Star Trek fan but I will NOT buy any Star Trek DVD's until Paramount starts providing extras as other studios do.What about some 20 minute documentaries(you do have them as I have seen them),some interviews,directors comentary,20 minute special effects documentaries(Paramount has them too)?Not good enough Paramount.You make a lot of money out of ST fans but you give very little in return."
4,A very good Trek movie,"This is a very good movie and a little on the light hearted side which is ok, the story is very good and it was a very good way to bring Spock back. My only complaint about this movie are that Kirsty Alley was replaced by Robin Curtis. They should have paid Kirsty Alley the money she wanted because Robin Curtis was not very good at all. I'm sorry she was very bad and it is painful to look at her act when she is on the screen. Now on the other hand Christoper Lloyd is the best Klingon I have ever seen and plays the role very very well. This film is in no way near the best of the Star Trek films but it is a decent one and worth watching and having in your collection. There are some very memorible moments in this film like Uhura dealing with the young ensign in the transporter room, and Kirk's fight with the Klingon. Add this one to your collection it is enjoyable to watch from time to time."
2,The Worst Star Trek Movie!,"People are always complaining that Star Trek V The Final Frontier is the worst of the Star Trek movies and I know I'll probably be blasted for saying it but I think the worst is actually Star Trek III The Search For Spock. This movie has it's moments but it's mostly boring and was just not as good without Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and I think the character of Saavik was just not the same without Kirstie Alley playing her, Kirstie made the character so interesting in The Wrath of Khan but even though Robin Curtis is not a bad actress she was just kind of bland in the role of Saavik, just didn't have the oomph that Kirstie Alley had! I rate this 2 stars but would give it 2 1/2 stars if this web site allowed that, I wouldn't give it any more then 2 1/2 stars though!"
1,Not good enough...,This had so much more potential but bad writing and animation made it seem like a drag...just watch a rerun of the show instead of getting this..
1,"Overated, dreary, badly written and poor production values","This shabby conclusion to the Wrath of Khan is the film that really started the star trek motion picture curse of the odd numbered films. Sadly, the Next Generation are still plagued by it."
4,STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK,"Naturally, the Star Trek franchise wasn't going to let Spock simply rest in peace, so who better to bring Spock back to life than Leonard Nimoy himself. Though a quality effort in every way, this has been a somewhat underappreciated Trek movie, perhaps because it had the simple misfortune to come right after the great Wrath of Khan. Star Trek III does pale next to its predecessor, but so does every other Trek film. Looked at on its own, The Search for Spock certainly meets every reasonable expectation. Good humor, the first appearance of a Klingon cloaking device, strong action, the return of Sarek, a stirring subtext on loyalty and friendship, and the dramatic demise of both Kirk's son and the Starship Enterprise itself. Not to mention Robin Curtis seamlessly stepping in as Saavik and the great Christopher Lloyd as Commander Kruge, the baddest Klingon ever. Not the definitive Star Trek, but stalwart sci-fi entertainment."
4,Great followup to Wrath of Khan,"I really like The Search for Spock.It's probably one of the more somber of the Star Trek movies,without a lot of humor,but it's still a great film.The Enterprise is to be retired,but Kirk and his crew steal it and race to the planet Genesis to rescue their friend Spock.Of course the Klingons want Genesis,too.The Klingon villain Kruge,played by Christopher Lloyd was pretty cool.Nothing personal meant to Robin Curtis,but it's too bad Kirstie Alley didn't reprise her role as Saavik in this film.The special effects are great,the musical score was very good,and it was great to see Spock alive and well!"
4,Search No Further,"An emotional and loyal movie, the crew put the good of the one infront of the good of the many. (A theme in films II-IV)The movie was of epic proportions. The final scene and the valediction of the Enterprise brought a moment to all of our eyes and our hearts.While it is unstated, it is assummed that Savik mated with Spock during his Pon Far, and that is the reason why she stayed on Vulcan in ST:IV (to bear his child). Watch and see what you think.Genesis becomes tainted, in so many ways, in this movie.Overall, a fun movie and a great time!"
4,"Solid sequel to ""Wrath of Khan""!","""The Search for Spock"", while not up to the par of the previous Trek movie, is nonetheless one of the better films in the entire series, despite the fact that the title character barely appears. Making up for his absence, though, is the return of his father, Sarek, as well as the heart-tugging ending on the planet Vulcan. Slightly marring the film are Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon captain (just can't picture Reverend Jim as a Klingon!) and a different actress playing Saavik instead of Kirstie Alley (from Trek II), who was born for the role. However, these are minor detractions. Seeing the destruction of the beloved Enterprise, being watched by the planetside crew, is worth the price admission (or rental fee), alone!"
3,Great movie. NO EXTRAS (French language doesn't count)!,"I would have given it more stars, but considering that there are NO substantial extras, it's overpriced (unless you buy it from HERE that is...it's retailing for about $27-28 everywhere else). I do think it's a really enjoyable movie. I am glad that they had the presence of mind to remix the soundtrack in Dolby 5.1.. That is a definite plus. However, if Paramount keeps releasing the Star Trek movies without deleted scenes, commentary, documentaries etc.., then they have to start charging less. Heck I think Amazon was selling The Abyss double DVD special edition for the same amount as Star Trek III! As a previous reviewer had mentioned, the extra footage and documentaries EXIST. If I'm going to buy the DVD, they should be on there. No excuses. Put them on there, or charge less."
3,Average Trek,"This was just an average outing into the world of Star Trek.You pretty much knew that they wouldn't let Spock stay dead.What would Star Trek have been without Spock?So this is how they brought him back from the dead.Too bad they decided to destroy the Enterprise,it was kind of stupid to destroy the original ship,only to bring it back at the end of The Voyage Home(ala the ressurection of Spock?)All they did was paint an ""A"" onto the original studio model of the Enterprise(Watch the end of Star Trek-The Motion Picture.When it emerges from the VGer cloud two lights can be seen moving along the upper,primary hull(saucer)towards the bridge.Then watch the end of Star Trek IV.Same scene,except for the added ""A"".)C+ rating at best."
5,I fine exsperience,I really don't have too much to sayI purchased the dvd from this sellerand it showed up in under a week.I have watched it and it plays
2,KIRK & CREW LOG WEAK ENTRY,"Given that Kirk & Co. already know where Spock is, it's not much of a ""Search."""
2,This Movie is Completly pathetic,"The Fans of Star Trek wanted Spock back, and the writers were working very hard on exactly how to do it. There sollution was this movie, and it was the of the worst Star Trek movie, except The Motion Ambombination and Star Dreak 5: the Boring Frontier. The replacement of Lt. Savvik was not a good idea because the replacment was nowhere near the talent of Kirstey Alley. This movie had to happen to set the stage for the best movie Star Trek Four: The Money making Journey Home. Star Trek is usually great, but this movie did not hit the spot at all."
4,"Good-bye, Enterprise","At least the freshly refitted but fictional USS Enterprise meets a noble end in combat. In the real Navy, the mighty USS Independence, CVA-62, was recently sent to the Mothball Fleet despite its multi-million dollar Service Life Extension Project overhaul here in Philadelphia.And you've got to admit, watching the Big E burn through the atmosphere is still thrilling, especially on a modern big-screen TV."
5,Great movie,This movie definitely holds up over time. I was surprised how much my wife and I enjoyed it. Worth the watch!
3,Good movie,"This film is an excellent direct-sequel to The Wrath of Khan. While not quite as good, it's still worthwhile."
4,A very interesting DVD,"Although this is not the best film in the series, that title went to the previous movie, The Wrath Of Khan. In my opinion, I think its the best of the reissued Star Trek DVD's so far. Why you ask? On disc 2, you get to hear Willian Shatner as the sorest man in Hollywood, slamming poor old Leonard Nemoy and the executives at Paramount. I am not going to ruin it for you, just watch as Shatner explains how he saved the day and what a wonderful man he is!"
5,The Needs of the One Out Weigh the Needs of the Many!,"Spock is missing, and the rest of our crew must find him.Leonard Nimoy picks off where The Wrath of Khan left off. This also includes the new and improved Klingons, which we got a glimpse of during the Motion Picture. We get the second chance to see a Klingon female. And this film brings back classic material from TOS.Unintentionally, this film, with Wrath of Khan, became part of a trilogy of trek films with the next chapter; The Voyage Home . . ."
3,Spock Lives Long & Prosper!!!,"After Spock dies from radiation and dropped on the Genesis planet, he is slowly reborn! Kirk and the crew are forced to go rogue, and steal the Enterprise in order to go save him. They must deal with greedy Klingons who want to control Genesis. This isn't one of the best sequels, but it's pretty good! If you are a Trekkie, you'll love STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK!!!"
4,"""It Was Fun""","As Kirk said in Generations. But I have one question to ask. Where's the director's edition? Afterall, this is a great movie, and the clean up and 5.1 sound is awsome. But why is this only a special edition? The extra features are great, but where are the deleated scenes? Espically the one where Kirk confronts Bones in the elevator. It's little scene's like this that made ST II:TWOK(directors edition) awsome.This is a must buy for any Trek fan, but I hope Paramount give the rest of the movies a director's edition(espically ST:Generations, put back the lost opening). But all in all this is still a great movie to watch."
4,"Trek Classic, definitely worth the $","I bought this DVD for my father, who, at 76 years of age, is a new Trekker. He enjoyed it very much. What's to say bad about Star Trek? Great DVD at a great price."
3,Search for Spock - he's ba-aack!,"Average followup to STII:Wrath of Khan. High points: Character development (every key character has something to do in this film), Leonard Nimoy. Low points: Comparatively weak storyline, a weak job by Christopher Lloyd (I guess I am just used to seeing him in the Back to the Future movies). Still worth having in your collection, though, if you like Star Trek."
2,Spend a little Money Paramount,"This is a great movie (like the rest in the series) that falls victim to Paramount Pictures typical piss pour packaging for DVD. This is common with all Paramount Releases that I have rented or purchased. Big on hoopla light on content, No behind the scenes, No commentary, No Story boards, No nothing except for a trailer, and foreign language support (isn't this on all DVDs? What so special about this?). Now I would expect this with a smaller release but this is Star Trek the mother of all Sci-fi Flicks. I really can't recommend buying, unless you don't already own it. Except for a little better picture quality than VHS, your not getting anything else. I think that maybe Paramount is saving real special features for a special edition, of course you'll have to pay 30% more for it. What a fleecing."
4,You know what this is.,"III isn't my personal favorite Star Trek, but obviously it is a must have for any Trek Fan. Finally they come out with the special editions. Dvd quality and extras are good but not great. Best there is though and certainly worth the price."
3,"Slow, but essential to the trilogy.","Star Trek III takes a lot of flak for being slow-moving and a bit pedantic and, hey, in many respects this is fair criticism. I choose instead to focus on two things:1. The ""Star Trek Trilogy"" (Movies II, III, and IV encompass one long mission) is a great story, and this movie is a fine bridge between the Khan encounter and the time-travel mission to Earth.2. (SPOILER ALERT FOR THE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE) This movie contains two of the most entertaining happenings in the Star Trek universe -- the theft of the Enterprise and the destruction of the ship.The new DVD will finally make the movie, rough on both widescreen VHS and the earlier DVD, look refreshed. The Search for Spock isn't the greatest voyage in the Trek universe, but it's a good ride and serves its purpose well. Recommended."
4,not as sturdy as I hoped,"This product was just what I needed, although it could have been a bit sturdier as the shower rod it's holding up is substantial. Loved dealing with the company as I paid extra for faster shipping and I actually got what I paid for!"
4,Excellent service,Experienced a shipping problem with UPS and vendor responded promptly sending another shipment. Happy with product and service which can be difficult working online sometimes.
3,Good video - marred by cruelty to animals - needs childrens warning,"You can read the reviews here on why this is a good video. For the aspects of keeping alive authentic Aztec traditions you have to agree completely. So this has really good information you won't find anywhere else.However, in the first part of the video there is a scene with brujos (black magicians) that goes on way too long. They are performing a ritual for dark magic and sacrificing a chicken and there is lots of blood. This is clearly either real or depicted cruelty to animals. There should definately be a content warning about this at the front of the film. So as it is this video is very inappropriate for children. Even adults will find that scene very distasteful and like I said it goes on way too long. It does spoil an otherwise very good video."
3,Insightful but where are the Mayans????,"First of all let me say that this documentary does break the mold. It is not your average documentary. The filiming is beautiful and it really does create a doorway into what Carlos Casteneda would call a ""non-ordinary reality"" however it is heavily focused on the last living Aztec medicine man and does not nearly talk about all of the great Mayan elders and their wisdom. It's one of the better 2012 Aztec films out there but don't expect it to be a Mayapolooza."
3,"Please don't sell returned items as ""new""","I received them in no time at all. However, they looked as though they were returned at one point...the fabric was soiled and the packaging (hard plastic covering) was stapled shut. Not that it's a big deal in that they were in serviceable condition and knowing the kids will have them marred in no time after opening, it's just dishonest to sell as new."
3,DON'T EXPECT THE COLOR YOU SEE,"Great first hockey stick for my daughter, but I am very disappointed we didn't get the pink sticks I thought I was ordering. Oh well...I guess as long as she learns to shoot the puck well, who cares about the color!"
4,This book brings up questions regarding faith and acceptance,This book has forced me to rexamine my beliefs on miracles and God's ways. Was Mariette faking? Was this really the work of the Devil? Or was this the sign of her exceptional devotion and her destiny for saintliness? I loved this book and i highly recomend it for religous and non-religous alike.
5,Achingly beautiful prose; poetic imagery,"Hanson's prose is achingly beautiful. His images are as objectively poetic as a Japanese landscape painting on a silk screen. His sense of the ""thinginess"" of things, and for evocative but not cloying factual detail, is wonderful. His depiction of the passage of time is so fine-grained that it is shocking to recollect that the novel encompasses only six months. If you have a taste for fine writing, drink deeply! If you want a sympathetic but grittily real portrayal of the work of spirituality, drink again. Ten stars!"
3,Intriguing,"This was ambitious of Hansen, who has labored skillfullly but without distinction in general. Worth the read, though without the profundity the subject matter might suggest. I am waiting for Hansen to break out with his masterwork (and beginning to worry that he is satisfied to interest and intrigue us without realizing his full potential)."
3,"well, it's different","Ron Hansen certainly went about a lot of research in order to put this book together, which as far as I can tell is a fairly accurate portrayal of an early 20th century convent in upstate New York. Unfortunately for me, I tend to like books that have some closure, and therefore I was not overly fond of this novel. The enigma that surrounds the main character, while enchanting at first becomes merely annoying, in that a reader isn't sure of what is really going on. Perhaps Hansen has a reason for this, but to a reader who is also a writer, I felt as though Hansen wasn't always sure himself what was happening to his characters."
2,A Nun in 1906 Upstate New York...,"I was quite surprised at this book after reading it in a single day. It's not a long book (only 179 pages) but it wasn't what I expected. I wanted a more intricate story with sub-plots and more controversy. It's clear that Catholic convents had strict rules in the early 20th Century. It took me into a loop when Mariette has a stigmatic experience that no one took seriously; whereby, she was dismissed from becoming a nun. The story really lacked a good plot and there were too many SISTERS in the story. One is better off finding the excellent film, THE MAGDALENE SISTERS (which is based on a true story). The writing by author Ron Hansen cannot be overlooked as he does have a special style. This was a National Bestseller in 1991. I think a lot of readers were intriged and 'let down' by the title alone. Oh well...it added a completely new subject as a follow-up to my last book (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN--Haha)."
4,"Beautiful and haunting, but.....","I agree with those who say the prose is wonderfully sparse and the novel gripping and seductive. However, I find much of the writing too studied -- to the point of pretentiousness. Sometimes,the descriptions seem so carefully, almost painfully crafted that one is more aware of the struggle of the writer than of the imagery itself. That awareness actually comes between the reader and the story at times, jarring one awake with a great desire to tell the novelist, ""Oh, puh-leeze. Just say what you mean and stop trying so hard to be clever."" Unlike some reviewers, however, I am not troubled by the enigmatic ending, because it reflects the very nature of such events and the human response to them. I like the fact that the author did not insult the reader by attempting to neatly wrap up the story by coming to a firm conclusion about Mariette's stigmata at the end."
5,Roses,This is a book I've read several times. The layers of meaning of the story are different each time. The emotions are touched and the ending unexpected. Questions are raised on the way that can be answered only by each one's heart. I've bought several for gifts and will buy more. Ah Roses.
5,STIGMATA,"Every book I read I am able to put down to accomplish chores and that sort of thing. Not Mariette in Ecstasy. I read it straight through and was dazzled by the richness of Hansen's words, by Mariette and by the cruelty of some of the nuns. It's an amazing read and it will take me forever to get over it."
4,Believeable!,"Who am I to say whether Mariette's stigmata was indeed real? Self-sacrifice and a longing toward selfless service could have been her calling. As Mother Superior suggested, we may need only be willing to serve in cloistered life; not necessarily be expected to carry out that willingness. Thought-provoking."
2,Spiritually manipulative,"The book is well written and engrossing, but the author uses his Catholic religious knowledge to build a ruse. The reader may involve themselves spiritually in the happenings, the Scriptures and prayers, to be let down in a manipulative ending. What a shame. I'm not interested in reading more of Ron Hansen's works."
3,Unbelievable,"The book revolves around Mariette, an eccentric young girl, giving one a rather weird and dark image of convent life. For a reader that is seeking an insightful portrait of religious life, I would recommend ""In This House of Brede"" by Rumer Godden."
4,Interesting Book!,"This was a very interesting book. I'd never heard of either the book or the author, until it was mentioned in another book I was reading,Beauty Will Save the World: Recovering the Human in an Ideological Age.Mariette is a young girl who joins a monastery to become a nun. While there she experiences the stigmata. The question of whether she actually experiences stigmata isn't necessarily resolved. What is most interesting about the book is how the different residents of the monastery react to her stigmata. Their hearts are truly revealed by their reactions to the stigmata.The writing style was different than I was used to, but having experience reading Cormac McCarthy, I am prepared to adapt to any style of writing.All in all, Hansen does a good job of peering into monastery life and the hearts, good and evil, of its residents."
4,Beautiful Read,"This is a very good book. I have now read three of Ron Hansen's books: Mariette in Ecstasy, Atticus, and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Atticus is the best of the three, but Mariette is a close second and may be the more impressive. How Hansen weaves a gripping story out of the ordinary lives of religious sisters and their new postulant is truly remarkable. I don't want to give away anything, but the way the book leaves things open to interpretation is intriguing. I am not sure I understand the book fully, but that ambiguity is part of the point, I think."
2,All recycles...again,"Improved sound but what a disappointment: a dependable reissue label issuing the same old re-recordings by a Rock and Roll legend.If Vee Jay was all Rhino wanted to issue, why not clean up some of the 10-12 great cuts Richard actually did for that label in 1964-65? A rarely seen alternate take of the Soul Classic, ""I Don't Know What You've Got (But It's Got Me)"", with Jimi Hendrix and Billy Preston, would have helped; also, stereo ptressings of ""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy"", ""Going Home Tomorrow"", ""Something Moves In My Heart"", ""You'd Better Stop"", among others."
4,"Great Propoganda, Not very Instructional","This book is a great testament to the fact that children can in fact be potty trained early in life, as soon as they are able to sit on a potty the author attests. Unfortunately she spends far too much time ""selling"" her readers on the idea of early start potty ""learning"" and not enough time actually teaching parents how to implement the practice. It is a great reference though and I intend to attempt the early start potty learning with my next child. It seems to be a bit too late for my nearly 2 year old this time around. I'm going to try Teri Crane's Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day instead."
2,Did not give tips to me,"I started potty training my daughter at the age of 10 months. All I've read about this book, promised that I would find guidance and tips on how to make my baby comfortable with the potty, but it's all theory there with ""Hallmark"" type stories. Some quotations are aggressive against modern American society and parents using disposable diapers. It even made me feel guilty and ashamed rather than enouraging. I come from culture where children are potty trained from birth. My parents started it when I was 3 months old. This book made me feel like I was lazy to postpone it till my daughter turned 10 mo. I found no guidance and no real tips. Only theory about how going in diaper is bad for health and Pampers corp. is evil. I regret for buying this book."
5,I plan to start even earlier with the next one!,"I just wanted to say that I LOVE your toilet training book and I've notonlyrecommended it to all my friends, but I've also bought several copies tohand out. My mother had 3 girls and 2 boys trained by 15 months each,and Ihad my own daughter trained at 17 months day AND night. (we had a bitof asetback when my husband had to go away for work for a couple of months,orelse I'm sure she would have been dry by 15 months too.) Both mysisters'kids are fully trained at 18 months, and thanks to your books, I'veconvinced several of my friends to start training their babies andtoddlersright away -- even one mom who didn't train her first one 'til he was 4,andis now training her 13 month old!Anyway, keep up the good work and THANK YOU for being that ONE personwhodisagrees with the rest of this miserable country."
3,"It's Okay, and I'd Still Buy it Again","I was hoping for more of a step by step approach. I find myself re-reading the paragraphs to put it into step form. My son is 20 months old and I think this book would do better for the 1-12 month old. I will keep this book and begin my next child right away! I think I'll have to find a different plan for my 20 month old. It almost has me convinced to use cloth diapers for my next child. Also, my son responds to the removable potty seat instead of the actual potty chair this book swears by. I completely agree that it's possible to train children much younger than 3, because yes they have to in 3rd world countries!"
3,For stay-at-home parents,The book is okay. Not the most helpful. It basically says that disposable diapers are bad and shouldn't be used. It's very hard to follow her advice for parents that aren't with their child 24/7. I wouldn't recommend this book for working parents.
3,It works... but no need to read the whole book.,"This book was very helpful helping me understand what toddlers can and cannot do... but there is way too much fluff! In other words, the book could have been about half the amount of pages. The author kept repeating the same thing. Once I got to the section on how to do it - it was great.I totally agree with the concept... no reason to wait until after 2 to start training. My son is 19 months old and loves going on the potty... I figure in a few months we'll be potty trained!"
1,good Deliverance and Bad deliverance.,"This is a group who has very little if any true talent. They play on theatrics and their ""shock them"" lyrics. This is music based soley on shock value alone! The metal ""christian"" group Deliverance that had great albums such as ""Weapons of Warfare"" and ""Stay of Execution"" and even the self titled Deliverance album all blew away anything this Deliverance group ever made! They made it MTV Headbangers ball which is unheard of for most Christian rock. this band not so.. probably because of the lacvk of true talent. So I must say it is ironic that one group is ""christian"" and one group is ""satanic"" because you can say one is the ""GOOD"" Deliverance and one is ""BAD"" not only lyrically but Literally!"
4,This is why I'm an Olay fan!,"I like this eye gel a lot. I don't have wrinkles yet but decided since I'm in my early 30's that it's time to start using eye cream sooner than later. This gel makes goes on cool and makes the skin tingle. For an added treat, put it in the fridge for an extra refreshing feel. The skin under my eyes does feel baby soft and moist but I don't know for sure if it's erasing any fine lines. The price was right and It came pretty quickly too. I will order again in the future."
3,"First of all, I didn't find very much ...","First of all, I didn't find very much information about the product on the package. I was looking for something to tell me what would happen after using the product. I probably used it for a week, and during that time, I lacked sleep. It was my understanding that the product was to be cool and refreshing when I applied it, but I didn't find that to be true. It's really hard for me to say if I noticed a difference after applying it. I'm kind of skeptical as to whether it really did any good. One good outcome is that it leaves a good base to apply your makeup over, especially when you have dark circles under your eyes."
5,This product will last a long time. Each ...,This product will last a long time. Each application takes only a small amount of eye gel. I would like to think that I notice a difference in lines around my eyes. I have few lines and I seem to notice them less. The product is easy to use. I would have liked to have received detailed instructions. I didn't know if I should use it just in the evenings or morning and evening. I would buy this product.
3,"no proof ""S"" holes","if you are only collecting the P & D coins this folder is fine, however if you plan to get the S coins there are no holes for them"
2,Bad packaging,This package was shipped irresponsibly. It arrived in what amounted to a shoe box and had holes ripped in it. I had to return it.
4,Perfect For Every Day Computing Needs,"I purchased this monitor (used) to replace the aging CRT for my Dell Optiplex GX-270 and I'm pleased with its performance. The monitor I bought, is 3 years old and my primary uses for it are: basic computing needs, watching live video feeds and live stock charts. My graphics display is an on-board Intel chip (not the most ideal) but the monitor still works like a charm. From my perspective, the only drawback is that there is no height adjustment. Otherwise, I would rate it 5 stars."
4,Not a bad monitor.,"The monitor works perfectly, my wife loves using it as her dual monitor backup. The only problem with it, is it came with a small defect in the middle of the screen, where pixels are slightly distorted, but we knew we were buying a refurb."
2,Why Bogie?,"One major reason Billy Wilder is now considered one of film's major directors is his brilliant casting. For Sabrina, he wanted Cary Grant for the role that eventually went to Humphrey Bogart. Big mistake. Bogie's fatal miscasting eclipses this film from being outstanding although it's fun watching Audrey Hepburn and gorgeous William Holden. Hepburn later recalled that Bogart was sullen and aloof during the filming and it carries over into his performance Ah, to think of what Cary Grant could have done."
2,That's a Gold Digger Right There.,"Viewed: 7/12Rate: 47/12: Gosh, was $abrina the original gold digger or what? Oh, David is adorable (but he is old!)...and he has money. Oh, wait a minute, he might be unstable. Oh, Linus...I like that name, and he is adorable (but he is way, way too old...old enough to be her grandfather). And he has money too! Ah, my life is complete. That's $abrina for you. A gigantic waste of time and a repulsive trip at that one. I hate the movie, and I hate Audrey Hepburn. What a fool. Humphrey Bogart got it right when he thought she was ""untalented"" and ""can't act."" All in all, puking sounds better when watching $abrina."
1,sabrina poor quality,The quality print of this video is very poor...I have seen this on tv and quality of print was very good..therefore I am not satisfied ..c.s.
3,"Hepburn saves what is a commonplace, predictable tale","Hepburn saves what is a commonplace, predictable tale.This is a romantic comedy that is in itself predictable but the vivacity and charm of Hepburn make it enjoyable."
5,MARVELOUS!!!,There is such chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. They are both terrific actors . The story is well-written and I really enjoyed when the father sat on the olive jar!
5,This Film has Charm that Movies just don't have these days.,"When I first saw this movie, I watched it in awe. And in the total of three days, I had watched it eight times. You'd see me walking down the sidewalk whistling ""Isn't It Romantic?"". I just couldn't stop watching it. This movie's charm just didn't wear off. I watch Sabrina every weekend. I feel, almost, as if Audrey is helping me through my problems, saying, ""Hey, look at me. I went after the cute one, but look at the good spot I ended up in!"" This is a movie I'll always be happy to return to, so all my stress in life can slip away, as I watch Sabrina."
5,Charming!,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie is a true classic. Hepburn and Bogart are two extraordinary actors and will remain two of my very favorites. I truly enjoyed this movie and will always enjoy it.
5,"One, two, three, Crack!","Susan Faludi, beware of this movie. This is a classic unfeminist supporting, fairy tale about an ugly duckling (played by Audrey Hepburn, can you believe it?) obsessed with a rich, unobtainable man. She goes off to paris to learn to cook, and ends up cooking for the rich unobtainable man's older brother for the rest of her life. It isn't the most ambitious of lives, but the story was well written and Hepburn and Bogart were stunning. Romantic comedies in the 90's just don't have the same charm."
4,Pretty good!,"Not my most favorite Audrey Hepburn movie BUT it is great nonetheless. Well... it can be because Audrey's in it. I love her in all her movies and this movie is a really romantic love story if you think of it. It's a wonderful story. The DVD I got was a tad bit on the dirty side but the CD-ROM was perfectly fine which is all that matters anyhow. My opinion is: I recommend! But! (keep reading) IF you are on a budget and are debating whether or not to get it, I say, PASS. It's not as good as Roman Holiday. (Once again, my opinion)."
3,Oh Audrey,"I love Audrey and I'm in my twenties so of course I've seen the remake of Sabrina. Embarrassingly I prefer it. This isn't my favorite Hepburn Movie, but it wasn't a waste of time."
5,Sabrina-The Centennial Collection,"This original black and white version of the movie Sabrina is quite enjoyable. It is light hearted with some poignant serious moments. Best of all, it has a happy ending. Spectacular acting by the principals, especially Audrey Hepburn and Humphry Bogart. It's also a treat to see a young Ellen Corby in the supporting cast. You may recall her as Grandma Walton on the Walton Family series.Sabrina - The Centennial Collection"
3,Golden Classic,"Good story, but don't be fooled by the colour photo: unfortunately didnt realise it was B&W when i bought it-- would have been 4 stars in colour. Audrey Hepburn is her usual cool calm and beautiful self in this classic title 'Sabrina'. A great film for those who can appreciate the classic hollywood era of movies. A treasured addition to any movie collection!"
1,Wouldn't work,I bought this DVD for my mother in law. She tried playing it and it would not work. It said region error. After several attempts at changing settings we still were unable to get it to work. We used a DVD player and a PS3 to play it and neither one worked. I took it home on my laptop and it showed the region was Asia (I live in the USA). There was nothing in the description or on the DVD case explaining what region it was in. Now I have a DVD that we can't watch and I'm going to have to buy a different one. Very disappointment that the description was not clear.
2,Audrey is excellent. Humphrey botches it all up.,"I only watched this after the 1995 version of Sabrina, and Harrison Ford is MUCH better than Bogart in every aspect. Someone esle should have played the role. It's OBVIOUS there was conflict between Hepburn and Bogart when this was being filmed. Terrible, terrible."
4,Classic Romance.,"A timeless classic that is the ephipany of romance. With Audrey Hepburn, William Holden, and Humphrey Bogart, this romantic comedy defines cinema."
5,Yeah; it's a five-star flick....,"True, it's pure Hollywood and there are some tiny flaws, but this movie is so enjoyable, that you easily overlook them. Bogart, Holden and Hepburn are all superb, as are most of the supporting cast, all of who work wonderfully as an ensemble. The remake simply can't hold a candle to Billy Wilder's direction and photography. Hepburn was never more beautiful, Holden never more sympathetic, Bogart rarely more charming. Trivia note: look for at least 4 future TV sitcom stars: Ellen Corby, Marion Ross (Happy Days) and Raymond Bailey and Nancy Kulp (Beverly Hillbillies)"
4,A PERFECT ROMANTIC HEROINE,"It might have aged a little, but AUDREY HEPBURN was always charming as a romantic heroine and WILLIAM HOLDEN and BOGIE are such an unusual pair of brothers that the remake could not improve on the original.JOHN WILLIAMS has one of his many supporting roles as the chauffeur.BILLY WILDER was one of the few directors who could alternate comedy and drama, and he had the knack to choose his actors well.As years go buy,we realize how AUDREY came to personalize a type of sophisticated woman that will culminate in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY.It might be nostalgia now, but it sures makes you feel good.Thanks AUDREY, we really loved you."
3,"Subtitles: English, ""French, Portuguese, Spanish""","I was hoping this movie had the Spanish subtitles, but it does not have any. It's a great movie though. I wanted the Spanish subs to watch it with my mom, but the product details are wrong and misleading. Only subtitles are English with English/French sound."
3,"remastered version, not colorized!","Product packaging, to include cover, lead one to belive this is a colorized version of orginal black and white film; but, it is not colorized. This is remaster orginal in black and white. As films go this is classic. With one exception orginal casting was for Cary Grant and not H. Bogart, which I think would have made this film even better. H. Bogart comes off a bit too old for Audrey Hepburn. Where as Grant, while older, would have been able to pull off the part better. If you love Audrey Hepburn, as I do. It's a must see."
5,Falling In Love With Audrey Hepburn,"Watching this great romantic comedy, it's not difficult to figure out why the men in the story, not to mention the real world at large, fell in love with Audrey Hepburn. She's charming, beautiful, and sexy, with a screen presence that's very unique. She's showcased well in this Billy Wilder comedy about a chauffeur's daughter and the two brothers that become involved with her. As the brothers, playboy William Holden is in love with her and serious businessman Humphrey Bogart needs to split them up to allow for a major business deal that hinges on Holden marrying another woman. Holden is well cast, and although I think Bogart wasn't the best choice for his role, he does pull it off. The dialogue is as sharp as you would expect from a Billy Wilder film. It's a classy film, with moments of great comedy and romance, and it's an opportunity to see Audrey Hepburn at her best and most beautiful."
4,Can understand its appeal,"*** spoilers ***Sure, it's sentimatental, predictable, sappy, and you name it. Yes, it is a piece of fluff, but a very well executed piece of fluff. The actors are well defined, as Sabrina tries to woo her childhood crush as Linus makes tries to wean her away so as to make a political marriage happen for the sake of his business. Of course, guess who falls in love with her also, and guess who Sabrina swoons for at the end? I know, real difficult.What makes this movie excellent in the incredibly witty dialogue, especaially Linus. Though It's unrealistic Sabrina would fall for Linus given his age, the amount of time together, and the extent of her crush on his brother, one doesn't really care because it's so well done."
4,Plastic drain,The parts that show on top are stainless steel. The rest of the drain is plastic. Will it hold up? I hope so.Update 8-17-2012 - Almost a year later and the plastic parts are holding up fine. It did install easy and did not leak at the connection. No doubt it will hold up for a decade or two.
4,Fun Concert..and correction for S J BUCK,"Basie rhythm section is of course tight, and I would agree that the front line is not always cohesive, but I still think its great fun. For SJ,in your reply to my Oscar review, the ""run"" you refer to in ""NightTime"" is not part of the tune. You have the transciption book taken from the ""Live At The Blue Note"" concert. He just happened to do a run before the tune and it was put into the transcription for some strange reason. I have no less than 6 recordings of the tune and have heard it live twice. In late 1989 and 1998. Not trying to be a smarty pants, but that is the deal"
2,They Tried - 2 Stars For Effort,"Outstanding rhythm section really swings, but over-all the ""Jam"" just did'nt jell... The Count was the Count - always great... But these sessions were just a series of ""tried-to-hard"" solos with no cohesiveness... 2 Stars...Fred Schofield, Alexandria, VA"
5,YOU NEED TO HAVE BOTH OF THESE ALBUMS,"IF YOU'RE TIRED OF ALL THE WACKNESS THAT'S RUINING HIP-HOP/RAP, AND ARE LOOKING FOR TRUE SKILLS AND LYRICS AS STATED YOU NEED TO HAVE BOTH OF THESE ALBUMS. DESPITE WHAT CRITICS SAID ABOUT THE FIRST ALBUM, BEING POOR PRODUCTION AND ETC., IT WAS A SOLID ALBUM. THE SOPHMORE, RASSASSINATION IS THE BEST TO DATE. DON'T SLEEP ON THIS ALBUM THE END IS NEAR. H20 PROOF FOREVER!!!!"
3,This album is a huge let down from Soul On Ice!!,"First of all, I think Ras Kass is the best lyricist in the West, but he sold out on this album. I recall him saying something about being a ""ryder"" which is unlike him. The lyrics were cool, but not his best, and the beats were better on his first album than this one(even though many may disagree with me). He could be the dopest if he wants to be, but I think he is too busy spitting rather mundane lyrics rather than being more conscious and positive which really makes me wonder if he even wants to be a pioneer. Oh well, I guess we will all know on Van Gogh."
2,Lacking of content from soul on ice,"How did the lyrics of this CD evolve from ""Soul on Ice""? It went from talking about religion, government, and other important issues, to rapping about meaningless junk about women, money, clothes, cars, and jewels. What a step down, from the potential he demonstrated on the last CD."
3,lyrically good,"when i bought this album i had only heard ras kass with xzibit on at the speed of life and 40 days and 40 nights, i was impressed by his lyrics in 3 card molly and thought i would give it a go as the featured guests were good(kurupt,xzibit,mack 10,dr dre and bad azz) when i first played it i started with rasassination which had a bumpin beat the first line shows you the lyrical skills that ras kass offers ""u aint got enough calcium to have a bone to pick with me"", the production is o.k. if Ras worked with better producers in this album then he would be recognised as one of the top lyricist on the west, his flow could be improved but tracks like H20proof are the highlight of the album, overall if you like to hear good lyrics then ras kass wont let u down"
3,h20 proof,"The first few tracks I used to skate to back in the day, and are dope. The rest of the album is garbage."
4,The End or The Begining,"Sure, his first album SOUL ON ICE, had some production problems, but the lyrics were so phat, you barly noticed. Now, the beats are slicker in THE END, but I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the thickness of the lyrics was compromised. Ras Kass could be said to be picking up where KRS-One left off. You can easily hear Dr. Francis Kress-Welsing, Dr. Ben, etc. al. The brother is definatly got the potential to move a portion of the masses toward consciousness."
4,Knocked Out Like Deebo,"Now that Van Gogh is in the stores and Ras is off Priority, it's a great time to check his first good album. The title track thumps and features the superior rappin' he is world famous for. I approve of Lap Dance, because it has the same groove as an old Prince tune and I like lap dancers, good folks. Easy Mo B has worked with Craig Mack and Miles Davis now he blesses Ras with a cool thump-thump beat on Grindin' , which closes the album out well. He does'nt drink Sprite but he knows how to change the game. This is dope West Coast hiphop."
2,Dull,"This book is geared toward the items in the White House more so than a Historiography of the building. While the book does a great job pointing out paintings and furnishings, it is a bit dull. You have to turn to the far back to read about the history of the building and the city. Recommended for Architecture lovers, not History buffs."
4,Great item for the most part,This was a great purchase accept for 2 things. 1 when it arrived the part with the toys was broken and it was easier to deal with Fisher Price to get the part replaced thrn it was with Amazon. 2 I 3 weeks later was able to go in to a retailer to find that this model is a last year model and they new one has some minor improvemants. If I had known this I would have ordered it through a different online retailer. I really suggest you do your research on the item if you want the newer model.
5,My kids love it.,"I have 6 month old twins and they both love it, now I have to buy a second one because they both want to jump in it at the same time. I have a saucer but it's not as fun for them."
4,great for active kids,"My daughter has loved kicking since (before) day 1. This toy gives her lots of joy. It's good for about 15 minutes of jumping before exhaustion hits. Good for getting the wiggles out before bedtime. The music is not my favorite, being slightly maniacal, but that's the curse of kids' jingles. She's 7.5 months and still bouncing vigorously. Place in front of a mirror (so they can see themselves) or a sliding glass door with outside views (if they love watching outside) for more fun. She enjoys being upright so she can see more.Only problem is getting her in and out, as sometimes the kicking legs get in the way, but that's not FisherPrice's fault."
4,Happy Baby,"Since I don't have a doorway sufficient for a regular Johnny Jump-up, the Fisher-Price Jumperoo was the next best thing. My 4 1/2 month girl loves it - whether I turn on the sounds or not. The high back is great for extra support and, until she becomes a little stronger, I just put a small blanket behind her for added stability. The biggest downside is the size. I wish it were taller and less wide. It's difficult to fit through certain doorways even with the movable front legs. Also, if it were taller, she'd be able to use it longer. She's already on the 3rd level!! All and all, she has a great time in it and that's what matters!"
2,Junk a roo,"Whenever a product turns out to be a piece of crap i go out of my way to tell the world. Our Junkaroo is only about two years old and is falling apart. And it's not from overuse or misuse. The legs fold for storage/transportation. They are supposed to be held in the open position when in use by little metal nipples that fit into plastic dentents. Yeah...plastic....that's gonna last. As one might expect, the nipple/detent system ultimately has failed and the legs won't stay in the open position. The whole thing is wobbly, dangerous and is basically going to wind up being more plastic junk clogging up our landfill."
4,Great - If you have a jumper Hyper Baby,Lexi loves to jump... but loves this item more if we bring it outside in the grass ~It has held up very well ... she in still playing with it 5 months later ~
5,WOW,"My grandchild adores this jumper! It was worth every penny. After a little while in this, she sleeps like a lamb!"
3,fun for a bit,"My now 6 month old liked this for about a month or so. now she will only tolerate it for a bit prefers the walker. or just hangin out on the blanket. also, it's so big and clunky doesn't really move around the house very well."
5,keeps baby occupied,"We inherited a Jumperoo for our older son from a friend, and also bought him an Evenflo Exersaucer. He definitely preferred the Jumperoo, and would jump, quite literally, for a solid hour a couple times a day if I needed him occupied (slept well those days!). Our younger twins both (slightly) prefer the Exersaucer, but enjoy both - they both like playing with their hands more, but the Jumperoo has enough there to fiddle with to keep them occupied. Depends on the kid - if a child seems like he wants to be up and jumping continuously, this can be a lifesaver. Oh, ours has withstood 4 kids jumping and it's not pristine, but still works like new."
4,Jumperoo,My daughter loves to play in her Jumperoo. She doesn't stay it for more than 20 or 30 minutes at a time but that is time I can get a few items checked off my to do list. I just wish it took up a little less space.
5,Very pleased!,Bought 2 Deluxe Jumperoos. They arrived quickly and were very easy to set up. Both babies love them!
4,I love it,Me & Baby love this! The only problem i have is that you can't change out any toys & she gets bored easily.
5,my baby loves this,"We got one of those ""hang in the doorway"" jumpers but we don't really have an good place to hang it so we exchanged it for this. My baby really has a good time in it, laughing and jumping all over the place! Recommended"
4,ONLY jumper like it!,"My 6 month old son can't get enough of this bouncer. Because it gains strength in their legs so well, I think all babies should have one. Definitely worth the money! I've had no problems with it...except for the fact that he likes it in half hour doses. I guess a chew-toy attachment instead of the wind-mill type toy would be better and keep him busy longer."
5,BUY THIS NOW!,We bouhgt this for our 6 and a 1/2 month old daughter and this is her favorite! Was worth the money. I travel a lot and its easy to break down and travel with. Plus it helps her legs get ready for walking! Must buy for your little one!
2,Don't order this from Amazon,"Spend the money at a store for this jumperoo. I had bought one several years ago that was much sturdier and smaller. The store bought one has the height adjustments on the bars itself and is not so flimsy. If it weren't for the cost of shipping, I would return this."
1,Our baby hated it. Get a Jolly Jumper instead.,"I initially picked this one up because we don't have a door frame to hang the regular Jolly Jumper from, and the stand alone Jolly Jumper looked too big for our small apartment.Big mistake. The height adjustment only had 4 levels. Not very good for a baby that grows. The seat didn't hold our son well, so he kinda flopped around in it as he tried to bounce. Two minutes in the thing, and he would get frustrated with it. The flashing lights and toys just got in his way - he wants to look at the world around him.I returned it after a week, and got the stand alone Jolly Jumper. Our son LOVES it. The first day we had it, he was in there three times, jumping like crazy, laughing, having a great ol' time.Get the Jolly Jumper before the over-rated Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo. Your baby will thank you.Jolly Jumper with Stand"
5,Wonderful,This is the best! My little one has been sitting in it since she was about 4 months old and loves it. She's just now started to really jump in it. It's a arm saver for me too since she likes to jump while we let her stand in our laps. My biggest reason for buying this was because i felt it was safer than the ones that hang from the doorway. In fact we borrowed a friend's when we were at their house that hung from the door and she didn't like it as much. She couldn't stay still if that makes sense...it would spin her around too much. Well worth the money for me!
5,So much fun!,"My son just loves this! We have always had the ones that attach to a doorway, but our new home had no place to hang one, so this is perfect. He would spend so much time jumping up and down, and even side ways. The higher he jumped, the more he laughed. The legs kind of fold together so you can fit it through narrow doorways if you need to move it from room to room, which I did. It's a little awkward trying to carry it, but not too bad. I like the height adjustment too. He has been able to use this for a long time (he is 10 months now). We have a new baby cousin waiting for her turn to use it!"
3,It's ok,"My 5 1/2 month son is not a big fan of it. He hasn't figured out how to jump yet but since loves standing, it keeps him busy for 10-15 minutes. Sometimes he gets frustrated because he can't put the attached toys in his mouth (he is teething). My husband is annoyed by the music, very circus-like, and no variation, other than turning it off. It's ok, but not really worth the money."
1,BORING!!!,"No wonder all the customer pictures above are of sleeping babies! This thing bored the poor things to sleep! It only has 3 toys for baby to play with. Not to mention it is hard to store and takes up alot of storage. Hard to move from room to room if you have narrow hallways (although I wouldn't have minded the storage problem if it could keep baby interested for even a half of a second!). Not to mention the one and only button that activates music and lights is kind of hard for baby to push. I even had to push it a couple of times to get it to start. Spend your money on the rainforrest, precious planet, or the laugh and learn. They have better reviews and tons more toys on them to stimulate baby. FYI: the laugh and learn on Amazon is around $300.00 new. If you are interested and don't like the price (I didn't!) try Babies R Us it is only $99.99 Hope this review helps!"
3,Get the Johnny Jumper Instead,"Our little man likes the Johnny Jumper (hangs from doorway and is about $19) much better. I would save the money and get that instead.Also the music on this thing will make mom or dad crazy!!!!Not a bad toy, just one of those things where the more expensive version of an simple old favorite isn't really worth the extra $."
5,"safe, fun and helpfull","it's a safe game, fun for my nephew .. and helpfull .. hlpfl .. coz my nephew sometimes changes into a devil .. can't stop moving and that bothered his mom alot .. i bought it as a gift .. and surprised her with it .. first i showed it to her and she said .. maybe i will buy it .. then i said no it's not good .. lol .. i was afraid that she may buy it while i have already bought it .. it's REALLY GREAT.. you HAVE to buy it really .."
1,Jumperoo not a good change,"My son is 9 months old and loved his exersaucer. So I thought that he needed to change his senery and would love to jump. I sold his wonderful exersaucer (bad mistake) and bought this online. Shipping was fast and very easy to put together. I put him in it and it was nothing but screams! So I try day after day and still he hates it. My hubby says that it is because he is too old to get used to something new. I hate that, beacause overall I thought that it was neat.Just a thought! Wish we could could return it, but threw away the box."
4,jumperoo vs. johnny jump up,"My son prefers johnny jump up a lot. Even though it doesn't make noise, he's able to turn in a circle and follow people moving around them with his eyes. The jumperoo takes up a large area of space and is hard to store because only one side collapses in and it doesn't make it much smaller. Unfortunately, we can't use the jumperoo in our house because there are no door frames to hang it from. There's no space above our molding to fit the clamp."
4,awesome product,"My 4 month old daughter loves this. It's also perfect because we can take it outside. While our older children play in the backyard, she can play in the jumper."
3,Better Out there,I tried my friends Jumperoo and it bounced but thats about all. I bought the Baby Einstein Motion Activity JUMPER. It's a jumperoo and activity center in one! It has more for my daughter to occupy herself with.
4,Best Buy for the Price!,"I LOVED this jumper. Our floorplan is very open, so we don't have doorways in which to hang a jumper. Also, that idea has always made me very antsy, so the idea of a free-standing jumper made me feel much safer. I love the 5 height adjustments, the washable pad and removable front toys. I love that almost every piece can be easily washed and the others just take a little more time. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the amount of space it takes up. It is very wide and even when folded, requires quite a bit of space. It does make some noise when your baby jumps, but nothing unbearable. All in all, I loved this product and so did both of our boys!"
5,wonderful product,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 1/2 months old and although it took her a couple of weeks to figure it out, she now absolutely loves it! It's well made and sturdy which is always something a new mother looks for. At 5 months, my daughter is jumping with the best of them! This provides tons of entertainment for her and anyone who's watching her jump. It's absolutely hilarious to see what a baby can do in one of these things...it's provided a ton of movie footage that she can enjoy when she's older."
5,Excellent product,This toy is a must have for babies 6 months and above. My baby Isabella uses it aboout 1 hour daily and after a few weeks she has developed her leg muscles amazingly.Assembly is fast and the stow away option works great. The toys that come with the jumperoo have not really grabbed her attention.
5,hysterical!,My daycare mom has this and the kids have so much fun bouncing in it. Their faces are bright and they are laughing the whole time. What a lifesaver! I might put the exersaucer aside and get one of these for my house.
2,NOT THAT GREAT.,"This was not that great. it took up to much room even when it was folded for easy storage. My daughter couldnt really get enough bounce out of it when she jumped and would only last about 5-10 min in it before she had had enough, so i sold it at a second hand kid store (lost alot of money on it) and i picked up the fisher price doorway bouncer with the tray and bumper around it. MUCH MORE FUN AND EASY TO STORE!!!!! My daughter had a BLAST in it from about 7 mos. to 13 mos. she got far more bounce out of it (catching a little air occasionally) and she would sit there spinning like a ballerina in it cooing and laughing. This product was in my opinion a waste of space and money."
5,My son just loves this jumper.,"My son just loves this jumper, we got it when he was 3 mo. old. He is 4 mo. now and has really got the hang of it. It took him a couple times of trial and error.But now that he has the hang of it, it's all he wants to do. He even tries to jump in his stationary play area."
4,Jumperoo - I bet your child will love this too,"This is a great toy for babies. It's a little pricey, but well worth it, considering how much your child will be in it. My son loves it so much. It is very safe, and works well in our house where doorway jumpers really wouldn't. I would give it five stars except for 2 things:1. The music it plays (2 songs) are shrill and annoying. We took the batteries out.2. The box says it is collapse-able and you can move it room to room. You can, but it is still pretty big to be moving around all the time.Neither of these things should keep you from buying this, however. It is a great investment, and will grow with your child."
1,Great music.....outdated remastering,"The selection of songs is great, and this is, arguably, Goodman's finest period. However, in the 20 years since this CD was released, re-mastering techniques have VASTLY improved, and there's no reason to buy this disc. There's a reason it's out-of-print. A much better choice for the same music, in far superior sound would be ""The Very Best Of Benny Goodman"" on RCA. A generic search on Amazon for Benny Goodman will put it near the top. It has almost the same list of songs, and he sound is cleaner, clearer, and more full and vibrant."
3,"Benny Goodman (sing,sing,sing)",This was a gift for my father. He has this on cassette and played it so much he actually wore it out. So I bought it on CD for him. I did make sure it had the same songs on the CD version Including his favorite song Honeysuckle Rose. As I saw and listened to the samples it did include that song. When it arrived it had every song but.... That's right Honeysuckle Rose. Even though he enjoys his CD but needless to say he was very dissapointed about that song not being there. So.... I was too!!!!!!
3,"Sing, Sing, Sing","Although there was about a ten day's delay in the receipt of the product, it arrived well packed and in good condition"
4,This book details why the Soviet Union collapsed,"This book shows from an individual's point of view, why the Soviet Union collapsed so quickly and completely. Who was Gorbechev and where did he come from. How did the Baltic states rise up and succeed. Why are the central Asian republics in ferment and uprising. It details the horrendous consequences of failed socialism. The mass executions of Stalinism, the ecological disasters of Breshnev and the simmering discontent and disillusionment of the populace are all presented thoughfully. This was a massive undertaking and although it is slow at times, after reading this book you could apply for the US Ambassadors' position in Moscow."
2,It Just Doesn't Last,"It was a great little phone for the first nine months. I'll admit, it did have its share of dropped calls but as long as I had a decent signal all was well. In the past month and a half the phone has completely gone to peices. First the battery life went from lasting me about three days to lasting just a few hours, then the phone stopped accepting the charger (I usually have to hold it in, so the phone is useless when out and about), and now almost every call gets dropped at least once. I took it back to Verizon and they told me I was going to need a new phone, that's a $100 purchase without a plan for a cheap phone that's not going to last the five years I had my Nokia for."
1,I've had this phone now for 1 year,"For about the first 6 months this phone worked great, but eventually the battery life and signal strength deteriorated. This phone says that it charges fully; then within a few minutes it has lost all battery life. I have switched batteries several times, so I know it's the phone. I have had so many dropped calls within these last six months: it's terrible. I would honestly say ""stay away from this phone or any LG phone."" It is a basic phone, but deteriorates to nothing within a few months."
1,"Bad reception, bad voice quality.","Reception is bad and goes into analog mode, drains battery in 6 hours. Cannot configure phone to disable analog mode/roaming."
2,buy something else. not worth it,"i've had this phone for a year now. it was my first phone. the first 6 monthes was great. until the reception started to die down and would drop my calls half the time. then the battery life started to go as well. the battery used to last up to 4-5 days.Im not so shore about the looks either. it was too simple for me. I just want something that has better looks, and more options kike get it now ringtones. i strongly suggest the nokia 6236i. my friend has it and he's very satisfied with the looks, signal, and battery life."
1,Not very good...if you need a really good phone.,"This is a really bad phone. My battery door falls off all the time, and then the battery falls out! Also, my phone just shuts down by itself. I've only had this phone for about a month! Don't get this phone!!"
2,Not well designed,These cable tips were advertised as pyramid and what I got was sunlite cable tips. The design is very poor since the thick part of the cable tip is on the tip instead of the end where the cable is inserted. Which is not how they are pictured. That said I'm giving them two stars since they do kinda work although I'll never buy them again.
1,I wasn't happy with this product at all. ...,"I wasn't happy with this product at all. The package claimed that they were more absorbent than other brands but this brand leaked on one of my lighter flow days, which I've never had happen before. I was also very uncomfortable with the fact that there was no applicator. It just doesn't seem sanitary to me and I could never get them positioned correctly. Based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this product to my family or friends and I'm sticking with my regular brand."
1,Not for gamers.,"Some three button combinations don't work at all, particularly combinations of ctrl, shift, w, a, s, d. Issue is with the keyboard itself, same issue in Windows or any word processor."
3,quiver,The mounting portion was warped and I had to do some fitting to make it work. After I did that it worked fine
3,Arrow and Quiver,Unit fit but I have not used them yet. Never the less I'm satisfied with their apperance. They will work well.
2,i thouth it was the crossbow,"it got here fast but i thouth it was the crossbow,the crossbow was in the pic like it was bing sold and it had the name of the crossbow and it did not say with out the crossbow"
1,Read very careful,Im glad i checked the reviews. This is NOT a crossbow for sale at a great price. Its just the quiver and arrows.
5,Top-Notch Modern Rock-Jazz,"Guitar ""shredding"" is not usually an appealing sound to me...it sometimes seems pointless and indulgent...but the pyrotechnics here from guitarist Lane (and he does sometimes just seem to shred ballistically) are balanced by more textured sounds and an attention to melody and harmony for an overall feel of intense musical energy. It means even the extended jams are worthwhile to listen to all the way through. This CD rocks and the sounds are memorable. Drummer Jeff Sipe is amazingly sharp and creative for a rock drummer. If anything, it is Hellborg who fades into the background a bit here."
5,This is a great toy,"I bought this for my eight year old nephew. It was the first toy he got out of the box after all the gifts were opened on X-mas eve, and everyone played with it all night . It is well made and works great, very easy to set up and start shooting. You can set the air flows to different heights and the balls float in the air perfectly. It comes with extra balls and the ""arrows"" have suction cup tips for shooting at targets. All the kids from ages forty down to four had a great time with it. Cats also find it highly entertaining."
2,Bruddah Waltah,"I bought the CD for one song and one song only -- ""Church in an Old Hawaiian Town."" It's a beautiful song. I also enjoy the sing along song of ""Sweet Lady of Waiahole"" and ""Hawaiian Lands."" Bruddah Waltah, in typical Hawaiian fashion, records other artists' hit songs. And in this case, not very well."
2,Not very good but at least it's expensive.,Doesn't come with everything it says it does and is not worth the price. The sponges it did come with came apart when I used them.
4,masters of the universe,"This is an excellent cd. No hype . Tunes like needle gun , masters of the universe, crank it up. i have a cassette and just let it play back to back. to back . It rocks and rocks . Still they play and play well: i wish I could find the lyrics cause this has tunes and images that are worth exploring further. From 72 to 01 still playing and playing very well."
2,Not what we had hoped for........,"Mostly disappointing book, not because of poor research or bad style, but poor subject. This book mostly concerns itself with the political infighting in outboard racing in the early 1950's. I know the header says it covers history to the late 1960's, but that is wrong, apparently written before the final editing cut was done. Almost completely devoid of any technical information about the motors themselves, slightly shakey on chronology at a few points. If the subject as I have described it is of interest to you, you will find this a very enlightening and interesting book, exceptionally well researched and presented."
4,Happy in the end,"This rug took an extraordinarily long to arrive. Apparently, the Colonial Mill Rug brand takes a while to ship things. I would have expected Outdoor Rugs to be more proactive about updating me on my order, but they were very prompt in responding to my emails.Now that the rug has finally arrived it looks beautiful. I selected the ""tea stained"" pattern and the colors online were very accurate. I was worried that an outdoor rug would have a really rough texture but that hasn't been the case. I walk on it barefoot without noticing. The rug is in a high-traffic area of my home so I'm hoping it will hold up better than its predecessors."
3,Plastic is discoloring,"It's a nice size ladle and works well with my non-stick cookware. But the ladle has discolored, the bowl part. It looks grungy and awful. Used soft scrub with bleach and the magic eraser. Still won't come clean."
4,All I can say.....,"A long time ago, I lost my virginity to a girl whom I had made listen to ""Slow Body Poppin'"" shortly before. That, to me, is powerful music! Also, the album was made a long time before the term smooth jazz was invented, and it shows. There is an honesty about this music not found in many modern, opportunistic recordings."
3,good but not what expected,"It was good but not crunchy at all. I expected more like a brittle, but they were chewy. Good coconut flavor, but didn't really taste cashews."
2,Look before you buy!,"Good news and bad news here.First the bad. The big named songs here, Roomfull of Roses, Almost, and Candy Kisses are all remakes done for Starday and Stop records in the 1970's.Now the good. This cd is the only available collection of his Stop and Starday recordings. ""Lilacs and Fire, and Sounds of Goodbye"" were all chart hits for Morgan. The sound is good and Morgan was always a great vocalist.More bad news, the packaging is generic. You can usually find this cd in a bargain bin or at a gas station."
3,a light hearted story line but focus on gays is confusing.,"the charachters depicted in this novel were very real and easy to identify with. relationships established while in college, i believe, maintain a stronger bond and therefore are longer lasting. i did not quite understand the strong emphasis on the gay relationships and how it tied into the dreams and goals of the main characters. i wanted so much to relate my experience with a new love to Yolanda's and Basil's but could not because of his gayness."
3,everything neatly wrapped up,"An interesting premise, and an easy book to read. It was just all too neatly wrapped up; it was too obvious and just too gooey to be given any higher rating. Even though the characters go through some pretty rough events, one never gets the idea that they are really suffering. Of course the coincidences in the story are just too much. How could one woman possibly be so closely associated (independently) with three different bisexual (gay) men who just happen to have their lives so related! And it all turns out so neatly! You won't be bored but don't expect the story to make you think"
4,INSIGHTFUL AND ABLE TO IDENTIFY,"As a fan of E. Lynn Harris I have been able to identify with his writings although it makes me ill that he doesn't start from where he initially leaves off. Towards the end of his stories it gets good but then you have to wait several years in passing to see what happens next with the original characters. In reading his materials it helped me find out who and what I was and it taught me to love myself unconditionally and that I was not alone in my feelings, and thoughts. I now know what I felt wasn't voodoo but that it was reality that many of us have to experience in order to actually deal with whom and what it is that we actually are. Thanks Mr. Harris for work well done!"
3,not as enjoyable as his previous books,I love Mr. Harris and the way he writes. Compared to his others this read like he had to meet a dead-line and breezed through it.
5,HARRIS DOES IT AGAIN,"Having read the three previous novels by Mr Harris, I could not wait to sample this. This book is a definate must read, intruiging, thought provoking and funny!!! Harris definately has a knack of drawing the reader into his stories without fronting or the use of vulgarity!!Itis a book that will hit you with your own prejudices right in your face. You will either love it or hate it!!"
4,"It was "" fair"" gift.","This was the first E. Lynn Harris novel that I read. I refused to read the other three novels a year ago when assigned by my Book Lovers' Club. I was not ready. Then my 20 year-old daughter, a junior at Hampton U. searched for it this past fall semester... I bought it as her Xmas gift. She left it @home for me to read,and I did. I laughed out loud a couple of times, but the plot was too predictable for me. Yet, I will read any future sequel about the complex John Basil Henderson."
4,IF THIS WORLD WERE MINE,"""If This World Were Mine"" by E. Lynn Harris is a well paced character driven story highlighting the trials and tribulations of four college friends almost twenty years after graduating from Hampton University. The plot revolves around a journal writing class the four friends form. Harris again proves a master at developing strong distinct characters and gripping dialogue to keep the story flowing. As usual Harris sprinkles the story with just enough surprise and scandel to keep readers completely engrossed"
4,If This World Were Mine,This was another book that I did not too much care for. One reason because the characters had too much going on. But then again this book did keep my interest. And I was shocked at the outcome of this book too. This book was on a different style and I really like that.
4,Good Book!,"I liked this book. I'm not saying I absolutely loved it nor that I couldn't stop reading but I can absolutely say I liked this book. I liked the way Harris gave the readers in in-depth look of a gay man and a bisexual man. Yolanda was truly a great character, she was witty and I think alot of woman can relate to her. I enjoyed this book. However; I wasn't engulfed. Reading it became on and off when the plot thickened so much I could hardly see clearly where it was going. But I'm glad I kept reading because it got exciting again.There was a suprising ending and it was very unpredictable."
4,I can't get my laundry done... it's this book's fault!,"""If This World Were Mine,"" by E. Lynn Harris.I just received this book and I haven't been able to put it down. It's so nice to see a book about black love and the many forms it can take. I think this is a must read. WARNING: If you don't have someone special, it will make you wish you did!! (: Happy Reading"
3,A must read,As usual ELH does his business of writing very interesting novels. If you haven't read the books in sequence it definitely puts things into perspective w/Basil and others.
3,It was a Quick read,"I enjoyed the book for what it was worth, it was not the book that will change my life or how I look at people. My problem with Harris' books are why must almost every man either be gay or have gay lust. I understand that from his perspective it would be nice, but damn can the sisters get a break! Of all of the male characters in the book only 2 wern't gay! Harris' writing is entertaining but at sometimes confusing."
3,If This World Were Mine is an average work by Harris,"I was able to read this book in one night. I think it is more due to a very predictable plot than to any innate reading skill on my part. At times, I felt as if I was reading And This Too Shall Pass with different characters. The similarities are obvious: Leland is a proud homosexual just like Sean from ATTSP. Dwight is a male Tamela and Uncle Doc is a male twin of Mama Cee. Harris has significant skill as a writer, I would like to see him use it for something more constructive than these predicable, sophomoric, sensational plots and characters. Harris is gay, and proud of it, but in order for me to read another one of his books he would have to tackle another subject than the plight of black homosexuals in this country. Furthermore, he can be truly over the top with his characters. Monty, the sex-crazed singer comes to mind on this subject. Overall, this book is a fun read, but if you have read Harris before it is just the same old story."
5,If This World Were Mine what magic would I do!,"This book kept coming into view & I finally took it home to read. What a homecoming! Friends from their college years, four African American Chicagoans face a year of change and tragedy, memories and a testing of their friendship. From the outset of journal keeping to the visits to special places in Chicago to the relationships, this read is wonderful! A great gift!"
4,"Well written, this should make E. Lynn a Star","After reading two of Mr. Harris previous books I was more than ready for this latest installment. He did deliver, I was a little more than pleasantly suprised to see some old faces and meet some new faces. ""E. Lynn ya don good."" A must read for everyone."
1,disapppointing fluff,"Wouldn't it be great if more folks who DID NOT like certain books took the time to reveiw them on Amazon? Well, here I am. And let me tell you E. Lynn Harris is not worth your time. He is, unfortuantely, a marginal writer with little to say. The only redeeming factor of this book, which I read while on vacation in St. Maarten, is that it gives a human face and voice to black gay men. But that was not enough. The characters and plot are superficial, trite, predictable and soap opera-esque. I felt my mind was turning to mush while I read this; eerily similar to the feeling of watching too much TV or eating too many potato chips. If you like Terry McMillan, you'll love this drivel. If not, read authors that challenge, teach and inspire. Harris does not fit the bill."
2,"Great MSG albums, poor sound quality","I'll keep this one brief. I picked up this 2-on-1 reissue ofThe Michael Schenker GroupandMSGbecause I thought it was a good value, and I've been pleased with these BGO reissues in the past (Angel, Fastway, Loverboy, etc.). Sadly, the sound quality of this reissue is just too poor. The ""remastering"" actually sounds worse than the original versions of the albums. If you're contemplating these early Michael Schenker Group reissues, you're much better off buying the outstanding EMI reissues separately. The sound quality of those reissues is absolutely incredible, especially when compared to this dud."
2,Big Disappointment,"I know there were a number of videos of this band from the old days on MTV but I had thought this record was better. Oh Michael's guitar playing is as phenomenal as ever and the riffs are quite heavy but for some reason, Michael cannot seem to find a quality singer since Graham Bonnet's debut on ""Assault Attack"". McAualey's vocals are lackluster and the lyrics are lame like there's no passion. The songs themselves are only lively due to Michael's guitar expertise with a good bass & drum accompanying him. I would not recommend this album for purchase at full price; if you're a hardcore Michael Schenker fan, then wait to find it in the used section or cut-out bin."
1,YOU'RE KIDDING ME !,"TO say this album is great is something very weird.. Goooooosh, look at the tittle of the songs.. love, love, girls, night is gonna last forever... THis nis nothing more than Schenker gone mainstream and pop, it's totally below the standard set in his days with UFO and recent works. Blergh !!"
1,When Michael Schenker meets Bon Jovi..,"MIchael's project alongside MacAuley was simply a total sell out.Nothing, I REPEAT< nothiong here is worth the quality of Michael's playing. Well, I guess he had bills to pay and needed the change...."
4,excellent,"Much of what you hear on 1985's New Faces by Dizzy Gillespie is not new. You get the bop-blues of ""Burks Works,"" the straight bop of ""Lorraine,"" and the Latin jump of tracks like ""Tin Tin Deo, and ""Tenor Song,""What is new are the younger musicians--Branford Marsalis and bass player Lonnie Plaxico--and the clean sound on New Faces. Gillespie was actually revisiting the various musical bases he touched through his entire career. His playing is here as speedy and detailed as it ever was.But it can be a very odd experience to hear this classic music in digital. This was a relatively new medium in 1985 and while you can't fault the quality of the recording, the quicksilver improvising is strange in juxtaposition with the buffered sheen of the audio. But musically, New Faces is beyond reproach, and if you have and if you have heard the classic Dizzy albums from the 1940 to the 1970s, this is without question one to buy."
4,Hmmmmm,"I have seen alkaline trio live on their UK tour and it was an amazing experience. This DVD is good, but it simply doesn't convey the complete rush that is an alk3 show. The sound is also quite poor but for anyone who has seen the trio live this is worth getting just for the memories of the gig that you saw."
2,No substitute for the real thing.,"I've seen the Trio a number of times and I think they're an excellent live band, but this DVD doesn't convey that. A lot of it has to do with the amateur quality of it - the shaky cameras, the relentless jump cutting, the poor dubbing. It's kind of offensive, really, that the Trio would release something so low-quality when they obviously have the means to put together a top-shelf concert DVD (or at least one where the sound and the picture even come close to matching). There are also problems with the sound that become apparent within the first two songs; ""Hell Yes"" and ""Madam Me"" are at completely different volumes. For a DVD that got delayed so many times, it sure feels like a rush job. If you're a Trio fan, you're going to buy it, but you'd be better off spending your fifteen dollars on a concert ticket next time the boys roll into your town. I, personally, cherish my memories of Trio shows much more than I do this cheap and ineffective DVD."
4,Good buy for the price.,"This is a good toy. My 6 yr old son is fascinated with it. I wish it had a few more point scoring options, it only has 3. You can score 4 points, 8 points or 20 depending on their aim. I also wish it looked a little more sophisticated. Its plastic with paper over it, feels flimsy. I can lean it against things so he can shoot at it at different heights but its not meant to free-stand. It should be hung on a wall. The gun shoots well! Good sound effects and 3 game types. I have had to buy extra darts, it comes with 3. Overall my son likes it, so I like it. Thanks for reading."
4,not bad,This toy is pretty fun for a while. But then you realize that you only have 3 darts. For example the one mode where you shoot the part of the board the sounds are coming from. You can't do it in time!! I bought this for the gun only
3,"pretty good, but gets old","i bought this set with my birthday money last year. it's pretty fun at first, but then it gets boring because you have to shoot a certain target to play the game you want. the gun's pretty good, but it only has 3 darts. i'd reccomend to save your money for the NERF Dart Tag."
5,Fun toy,"This is a really fun toy. I've played with my younger brother with this for longer than he has ever played with any toy. The target offers several modes for keeping score and it keeps me excited. Everything is not the best though, the sensitivity of the target is good enough, and sometimes the target sometimes does not seem to recognize a hit. The gun is actually very very powerful; the darts carry a good load which is probably needed to make sure that the hits register on the target."
2,An OK toy...,"Nerf toys are always a great choice for kids...a perfect birthday or Christmas present too! I get my boys a new Nerf or Nerf-like product every year for Christmas to add to their collection! They have great fun with them, and get them out of the house and away from video games! This one was not so great because the target got lost. The typical guns and ammo are the best because they can all be used together, and numerous kids can play at once. The target seemed to be for just one or two kids."
3,ok toy,"This toy is fun for a while but shooting the target gets boring. me and my friends use the target for practice and shoot the crap outta each other in a nerf war. Good weapon for sniping and recon, can give a lot of bruises"
2,No Good at all,"Hi,its me again Tom the 12 year old toy expert. This toy was a very bad toy, 2 of the 3 darts i had, broke, the tops got ripped off both 2 within 5 days after my grandma bought it for me. Plus if you give this to your kids, the gun packs a punch, so make sure they don't shoot eachother if there under the age of 6.***************My Top 100 Ranking: 92 ****************"
1,Broke quickly,"My son loved this target game but it broke very quickly. Also, it had limited appeal. He played with it a lot and then it was there. Skip this."
4,Nerf target game review,good toy teaches aim and is fun to play with others or alone durable just needs to be propped up against something but not a big problem
4,Very fun,"My brother got this gun and he likes it alot. You can use it for a lot of purposes. The price is worth it, too."
4,excellent for price,"this game works as advertised, target sounds off when hit, and darts actually do whistle when fired.nice game for age limit."
2,"Fun, but not very durable","My kids got this toy as a gift. They enjoy using it, but the 1st time we went to put in the batteries the screw that holds the battery cover got stripped and I had to break off the cover to get it open. Now it is held together w/ duct tape. Buyer beware."
3,Basically buying the target,"The gun was not a very good gun, somewhat fragile. If u buy this, ur basically buying the target. Use your money to buy the nerf n strike maverick. much better."
5,Great!!,"I never thought i would see a new Dolls Record and not one as great as this!! The new guys in the band play great and add a lot to the sound and David and Syl are as great as ever,The DVD is a nice touch and fun to watch,Looks like they are all having a great time making this record and it shows, a Great mix of Rockers,Ballads and Great Smart/Funny Lyrics.Buy this and while your at it pick up The new Pat Todd and the Rankoutsiders ""Outskirts of your Heart"" cd and you will have the Two Best Rock N roll records to have come out in Years!!"
2,New York Dolls 2006,"I wanted so much to like this CD. I was the first person to buy their 1st record when back when in another land and I still play them when Im in the mood.Got all the solo stuff and Thunders solo stuff too.Even though a few of our friends are not around now I would think the new musicians would play in the style of. In other words Mr. Thunders is missed hear,,,,RIP"
4,Dolls rock!!!!,New York Dolls still rock (even w/ only two original members!!) Listen to this album - it proves that even middle-aged guys can produce far better music than most of today's lame bands...Michael Stipe & Iggy Pop make appropriate guest appearances!!This album will make you wonder what has happened to quality bands...
3,All Dolled Up...,"... And looking pretty good, considering the circumstances. Only two original Dolls onboard, David Johansen and Syl Sylvain, so there's a certain Dollsy swagger missing. But then again, these days bands don't seem to know how to rock, so the ""Dolls for a day"" do a respectable job of channelling the missing Thunders/Kane/Nolan/Murcia mojo. Guest appearances by Iggy Pop and Michael Stipe are alright, but don't really add much to the vibe. Maybe they were called upon to add a little extra marquee value to the disc. Whatever... the New York Dolls have delivered a pretty solid CD and ""Dance Like a Monkey"" and ""Fishnets & Cigarettes"" are cool. I'll bet the Dolls are pretty pleased to be back. I'd give it a 3.5 if that option were available..."
2,A disappointment,"We all know that Johansen and Sylvain are the only original Dolls on this project. That's OK since they were part of the NY Dolls creative core and most of David Johansen's best solo material was cowritten with Sylvain. I had high hopes, but the songs on this disc have the feel of something that was cobbled together in a studio under a time restraint rather than that of songs that came to the New Dolls in moments of inspiration. The Dolls trademard dueling left speaker/right speaker half-lead-half-rhythm guitars is sorely missed. David Jo's voice sounds kind of shot. I don't know. This sounds like OK rock and roll. There's just nothing really special about it. This is too bad because I really wanted to like this."
5,"New York Dolls, Seems like old times","I've been a Dolls fan since I was literally a kid, and now as a middle aged guy, still love them. This album is fabulous, David Jo still sounds great. I really was impressed with how good it sounds, 35 years later! Bought it without hearing it, and put it on my I Pod Shuffle, and it brings back the old memories of being a youngster going to see David Jo in clubs from the Jersey Shore to lower manhattan. Worth the 15 dollar crap shoot!!"
3,Surprisingly solid,"The negative reviews of this disc seem a little excessive. I would much rather have a New York Dolls album than not, even if it is just two members. Think of it as contributing to their retirement fund. Aside from tracks 1, 2, 11, and 14, the music is quite enjoyable. ""Dance Like a Monkey"" is the catchiest song about the intelligent design debate I've heard, even if it doesn't really make a point. Sadly, it's the only song that I can imagine the original line-up would have performed. That still doesn't detract from the album's other strengths.For one thing, Johansen's voice sounds about three hundred years old. I don't know about you, but to me it sounds pretty neat. The lyrics are also ridiculously complex. ""Subterfuge Orwellian double-speak / unconsciously aware you little ego freak."" Nice. Ultimately the album comes down to two or three really catchy songs, and most of the remainder are thoroughly listenable."
2,Docked One Star For Calling This A New York Dolls Record,What we have here is a mediocre David Johansen record. Its better than Sweet Revenge and Here Comes the Night but not as good as the eponymous debut or In Style. And a New York Dolls record? Not even close. It sounds absolutely nothing like the two classic Dolls studio records. You can live without it. Go try to hunt up a copy of David Johansen Live It Up instead.
1,Tasteless and Tragic,"I can't begin to grasp why any alleged Dolls fan would even want to listen to this, let alone pay for it... I literally can't think of anything more tasteless and low class than waiting for every band mate who hated you to die and touring with the same name like nothing happened (especially considering the tragic fate of the infinitely more gifted Johnny Thunders and Johanson's openly dismissive behavior of his band mates as inconsequential props to his ""genius""- a belligerent assertion that seems almost laughable in considering the quality of his largely forgettable solo recordings in comparison with the few made by Thunders before his demise.) If Paul McCartney replaced John and George with two guys you'd never heard of and started recording as ""The Beatles"", I would imagine most people would be fairly disgusted, as they should be- the lack of outrage over this shameful display of ego and avarice remains a mystery..."
1,Just buy LAMF,"YUCK!!! How tired and contrived. Just buy all the Dolls older albums and Johnnys and listen to them over and over again, they don't get old and you don't need anything else. This is like an old fart in the wind. When people are young and sexed up they make amazing music, when they're old and all sexed up they make pitiful music. Sorry to all the geezers out there who don't buy that way of thinking but I wouldn't expect you to."
2,I waited 33 years for this??,"I love the Dolls old and new...The live Morrisey CD I quite enjoyed, but...I can really see/hear how much Johnny Thunders is missed after listening to this...This sounds like a David J. solo record..I would actually rate Johanson's first two solo records ahead of this...I realize they are in kind of a no win situation here, but they don't seem to have that down and dirty, gritty sound I always loved on this record (a little too polished)..Having said that..It's still better than having no Dolls at all..."
1,Lukewarm for the American Idol population.,"This cd gets worse every time I play it. More ""Grease"" soundtrack than greasy rock n roll, and the band sounds like a bunch of studio banana's rather than a real band. Cheesey rather than cheeky, too fabricated and totally tame. ""Personality Crisis"" for sure, these songs are weak pop rock for an aging audiance. Maybe they should have used this recording as the soundtrack to the forthcoming movie bio on the dolls, with Leo DiCapprio starring as David Johansen, Tom Cruise as Syl Sylvain, and Tommy Lee as Johnny thunders. Coming to your local multiplex, sooner than later."
5,If you love Rock n' Roll music - buy this!,"There's no point in repeating what others here have said. Had it not been for a chance perusal of the review in Rolling Stone, I never would have known about this CD. It is a great, joyful rock album - I never even listened to the Dolls in years gone by - but this one nails the spirit of the genre. I've worked backstage at Stones, AC/DC and Dead shows, and I modestly suggest that I know the real thing when I hear it. Tear the shrink wrap off, baby, and crank this one up on the way home with the windows down, while the weather is still warm enough to do so! If you're a guitarist, pay attention to what Syl is playing, and watch the video - he's really learned to do it right!"
1,TOO LONG TOO MUCH,THE NEW DOLLS ALBUM IS TOO LONG (50+ MINUETES). IF THEY CUT OUT THE SLOW SONGS IT WOULD BE A DECENT ROCKIN LITTLE RECORD. THE DOLLS FORGOT THE FIRST RULE OF SHOWBIZ: LEAVE THE AUDIENCE WANTING MORE! NOT LESS. THIS ALBUM IS EVEN WORSE THAN THE NEW STONES ALBUM.
3,Sociologist analyzes rock,"As Kurt Blaukopf, an renowned Austrian sociologist of music pointed out, sociologists have a tendency to pursue minutely specialized approaches and then overgeneralize about them. Fricke's prose is somewhat professorial (maybe the translation from German helped), but he seems to have a better handle on the rock phenomenon as a whole than the great majority of academics. David Szatmary's social history of rock is more meaty and interesting, but Fricke gets the big picture better."
3,not what it is marketed as,"This is a great insight into one of the great writers of our time. This book shows how he works. As a handbook for the upcoming writer, it's only value is in seeing how one of the masters works. though it does not ""help"" new writers, it is a valuable book because it shows the process michener takes."
5,SATigger,"My great-grandmother had the original version of this book with all of her penciled in notations. It has been passed down for years and it now belongs to my father. I've tried to finagle it from him, but it is such a family heirloom I can't convince him. These recipes have graced my family table for years. Pay special attention to the Sweet Potato Casserole. Amazing recipes! my dad did buy me one, but it's just not the same!!!)"
5,Maravillosa producción.,"Eddie Daniels es uno de los más grandes clarinetistas de nuestros tiempos. Músico reconocido en todo el mundo por su gran flexibilidad interpretativa en el lenguaje clásico y del jazz. En esta producción ambiciosa, Daniel da muestra de su maravilloso talento y virtuosismo a lo largo de los seis temas del cd. Sobretodo en el Solfeggietto, el derroche de virtuosismo es simplemente espectacular.Los arreglistas Jorge Calandrelli, Nan Schuartz y Torrie Zito nos hacen fantasear con el acompañamiento de la Philharmonia Orchestra nada menos.Es muy resaltante apreciar el interesantísimo Concerto for Jazz Clarinet y Orchestra de Calandrelli que se impone como uno de los más bellos conciertos modernos escritos para este instrumento. Maravillosa composición y orquestación.Es un cd simplemente hermoso, de un alto nivel interpretativo."
4,The Best Songs the Beatles Never Wrote,"""My Before and After"" and ""Password."" Just get it and listen to them - you'll be glad you did. Only the occasional Spongetones and The Orgone Box hit this level."
3,Good poppy songs - no need to say more,"This record is well put together and follows in the mid 60's Beatles tradition in that there are interesting sounds which are creatively mixed and solid songs to back that up .If you want to hear the above , then try tracking down this record .If you want the originals , try the Beatles !I happen to like both ."
4,"actually, 4.5 stars","when listening to cottom mather for the first time, sure, you think, 'dood sounds a LOT like john lennon.' well, that's music for you. people have similar voices. deal with it. and for what it's worth, musically speaking, cotton mather and the beatles are on opposite sides of the spectrum.reference points aside, 'kon tiki' is a brilliant album full of great hooks. alternately sad ('lily dreams on', 'spin my wheels') and exuberant ('my before and after,' 'vegetable row'). in the post-'ok computer' age, it seems people forget the simplicity of the standard vocal/guitar/bass/drum lineup. a band doesn't necessarily need all the filler if the songs are tight, and fortunately cotton mather has more than enough chops to forgo the 'wabbly keyboards.'with 'lily dreams on' featured in the final episode of veronica mars' first season, hopefully they'll start to get a little more well-deserved recognition."
5,BEATLES REINCARNATED,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PURE POP CD'S I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. GREAT 3 PART HARMONYS, GREAT WRITING, AND CREATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. CONSIDERING THIS CD WAS RECORDED ON ADAT AND 4TRACK CASSETTE MAKES IT EVEN MORE AMAZING. FROM A MUSICIAN WHO APPRECIATES THIS KIND OF MUSIC.... I LOVE IT....PLEASE RELEASE ANOTHER CD!!! From: Dan Van Elzen"
3,"Nice, but the Beatles resemblance is too close for comfort.","Actually it's more of a solo-Lennon-circa-1974-meets-Beatles-circa-1966 thing.This record satisfies my desire for new Beatles songs, but I'd be lying if I said it was the least bit original. The singer does the best John Lennon imitation I've ever heard. He sounds more like John Lennon than Julian Lennon does. That's the hallmark and the downfall of this band: they seem far more interested in recreating the Beatles sound than in exploring the Beatles' influence over their personal, presumably broader creative urges. Pleasant and probably worth the fifteen bucks, but forgettable.I wish I didn't care about the Beatles parroting, but I do. I can't get past the realization that if the Beatles had merely aped Buddy Holly or Little Richard, we'd never have know they existed. Either Cotton Mather is doing a good job of hiding that they really have nothing new to say, or they're playing some serious chicken with fate. Either way, they'll lose."
3,Ok I guess,"The people who say this album reminds them of Revolver era Beatles better have a good listen to that album again. A whiney vocal does not a John Lennon make. The melodies are ok, but there are countless powerpop bands that write better ones(the Shazam and Flashing Lights come to mind immediately). For a truley good Revolver sounding album get the Zombies ""Oracle and Odessey""."
1,pleese give me a break!!!!,"way too cute , contrived, i could not believe how much i disliked this cd, just play the songs out and stop trying to be so clever!!!!almost impossible for this 48 yr. old to listen to----give me the high llamas,lambchop,paul kelly and the messengers,or lloyd cole or beautiful south or lighthouse people,or big head todd or ben harper,or just about anything but this----i want my money back!"
2,Unbelievable,"I'm not a huge Tyler Perry fan, but I thought I'd give this one a try. This movie was just too unbelievable for me to get into. The biggest things I couldn't get past were 1) how CPS never got involved, especially after the oldest daughter told the principal that her mom's boyfriend gave her drugs to sell, and 2) how her friends could be so unnaccepting of Monty while setting her up with a trashy unemployed rapper. Julia's rapid change of snotty feelings and ability to drop her standards were too sudden to be believable as well.The characters were 2 dimensional and cliched. You have to really suspend disbelief to get into this movie."
4,CUTE AS EXPECTED,"I mean come on this is Tyler Perry... we all know he is not a award winning writer. Yes his actors over act at times but it's the message that is in the movie. He reaches so many people so that's what is important.Unfortumately there are all types of people in this world & mothers like the girls mom do exhist, the heartless Drug dealers do exhist, Women who can't find a good man definately do exhist & fathers who want the best for their kids do exhist...I am a little bored with the thug/drug dealer dude. Must be a cousin lol.I think that this movie was pretty good. atleast the men were not beating on women. I hope he continues to make movies. Practice makes perfect."
2,"Daddy""s Little Girls","This movie fell short of my expectations. The DVD release was scheduled in time for Father's Day, but the plot seemed to be centered (more) around a love-sick lady attorney who was looking for an excuse to hop into bed with the first man that she felt comfortable with, than the manner in which the father of the girls actually interacted with his daughters in times, other than dramatic-moments. I have one other Tyler Perry Movie, and the evidence from my viewing, is that althought his work center around family, it does not represent true African American Culture. It only reflects the thoughts that people of other races view African Americans. Those of different pursuasions no longer have to voice their opinions of us, because you can see it when you pop the DVD into the player."
3,Good DVD,"I think this dvd isnt as good as some of the others but I love Tyler Perry so I bought the DVD anyway. Its a good movie to own but its nothing like Diary of a Mad Black Woman, Family Reunion or Why Did I Get Married?"
5,Daddy's little girls...,I absolutely loved this movie. I have loaned it out to several people and the response is the same. I was a very good movie.
5,Excellent!,"Despite the ""no surprises"" storyline, I loved the movie enough to watch it twice in a row - possibly because I am a hopeless romantic! The actors work well together to bring life to a simple story. I've watched several of Tyler Perrys' productions and loved everyone of them. I must say he is making great strides in offering etertainement that is wholesome, funny and delivers a message without over sermonizing it. Plizzz keep up the good work! This is a must watch for all you sentimentals out there."
5,Tyler Perry's Daddy's Little Girls (Widescreen Edition),This is a great movie! I am glad to have it as part of my collection.
5,I love this story!,"Tyler Perry has done it again. A wonderful movie with Christian themes, that I can watch anytime, no matter who is visiting my home. Tyler Perry's productions are all a breath of lovely spring air in the crazy entertainment world of filth. Please, give us more Christian movies that are decent, with a good plot, and a sincerely good ending."
1,Not my favorite,This is a disappointing film by Tyler Perry & this comes from a fan who owns every single Tyler Perry Movie.
2,I would watch just to see Idris,"I watched this mainly because I wanted to see Idris Elba and also because I wanted to see and support Tyler Perry's movie. I must say watching Idris was the highlight. I'm not sure what happened with Gabrielle, I've seen her do good work but her acting was horrible. The storyline was predicatble and cliche.If using the boy from the wrong side of the tracks gets with the rich girl storyliine it should have atleast been a few twists thrown in. The little girls were even bad actors. Like the thought but wasn't executed well."
5,poetic novel,"I got this book for my mother. She has a vinyl recording of actress Lynne Fontaine reading ""The White Cliffs of Dover"" and it is fun seeing the text as well as hearing the record. Our recording is about three records and was made in about the 1940s, spoken word with orchestral background. It is a poetic novel. The story is set in England at the outset of World War II."
5,"a wonderful story poem. It takes place in England, during WWI & WWII","I first heard this poem on an old record with the actress Lynn Fontaine. It is a love story & some of the life of an upper-class family in England, during WWI & WWII. If you like England & hearing a great actress recite, you should try to find it. It also comes in book form. Very touching & a beautiful story."
5,Bonus Features,"You know why you want to own the DVD collection. You hope to be able to view the LOST series from the beginning and solve the mystery before anyone else.What you may find especially interesting, is one of the Bonus Features that shows ""a day in the making of LOST"". It is a condensed version of what takes place each 14-hour day from the standpoint of all the departments involved.A truly mindboggling amount of planning and organization is involved. Fascinating to watch. Enjoy!"
2,Good premise,"I'm late to this party and just recently started watching Lost on Amazon. Season 1 was GREAT! Season 2 became a boring soap-opera. By the time I was done watching season 2 I honestly didn't care if all of the characters died, and actually hoped they did.Note to writers-- piling on multiple layers of confusion into your screenplays is not storytelling. Even the actors look bored reading your 500+ subplots and back-stories.I started to watch the first episode of season 3 with hopes it would get better, but after ten minutes I was rooting for Jack to go on a hunger-strike and die on camera."
5,Best series on television,"Geez, these people here should just go spill on the Lost web sites and save Amazon a trillion bytes of storage. Look, the show is great - if you're even looking here obviously you like the show. Season 3 was excellent, if not the best yet - ignore the babble from the fanatics. Looking for a gift for someone that has seasons 1 & 2? They'll love it. The package is great. It's been mentioned some were missing the booklets, but mine was complete. No disc defects. Excellent quality. There ya go."
4,Lost on Lost...In a fun Way,"Lost Continues to be the only television show that I watch with any regularity aside from the office. I may not be the most savvy SCI FI consumer; yet I feel that if you open your imagination a bit and go for the ride Season 3 will take you on a journey of emotions that range from frustration to cheer, and then tears."
4,great show,I'm not sure I need to say anything. Season 3 was my least favorite but I have to have to DVD. It's a great show overall and the only one that I bought and keep buying the entire series on DVD.My parents and sister have gotten into the show now (well after the end of the 5th season lol) so they use my DVDs to catch up and for the extras.
3,"I Am Entirely ""Lost""",Talk about a dragged out TV Series. I don't think it would keep me glued to my seat if I had to watch it weekly. I 've been watching it by renting it from the library. I was kinda getting disgusted thinking that is this all it is (meaning the 3rd season). When I saw there is going to be a fourth season. So that means it'll will be awhile until I see the entire show. I just hope the members of the airplane get better housing this season. Being on the beach with that flimsy tarp and bush construction just won't do.
5,LOST - been renewed for 3 More years!,"Well im sure myself, and other LOST fans will be glad to know, as I'm sure any true Lostie keeps up with recent news, but I caught ""Kate's"" interview with Regis & Kelly and she confirmed they've been picked up for another three years. Some of this season was slow, while other episodes were that wonderful edge of your seat watching that makes us realize this really is a great, unpredicitable show where anything can happen. I'm looking forward to the Season Finale tomorrow night, will miss the 6 Month break I hear is looming, new episodes won't start again until January, but that will also enable us to have back to back new episodes next year. For those of you who haven't caught on to LOST yet, you've got time now, pick up a copy of this great DVD, or borrow a friends first, if you do I guarantee you'll want your own."
5,The Best Run of Episodes LOST Has Ever Had....,"Even though the first 6 episodes of Season 3 are rather slow, it is more than made up for with the episodes that follow. Starting with ""Not In Portland"" (and ignoring ""Stranger In A Strange Land"") you will not find a better run of episodes in ANY Lost Season. Fantastic stand-outs such as ""The Man From Tallahassee"", ""Par Avion"", ""Flashes Before Your Eyes"", ""The Man Behind the Curtain"", and especially ""The Brig"" are just absurdly entertaining and gripping hours of television.There was a lot of griping over this show in the beginning of Season 3, which unfortunately means a lot of people missed out on the absolutely stellar second half. Pick this up now if you are even remotely interested in the show, and if you are someone who stopped watching early on, I cannot even express how badly you need to see this season. 5 STARS."
3,too much of The Others,"Season 3 of Lost was for me the point at which the show started to get, well, lost. The show started to focus less on telling compelling character stories and more on The Others on the island. The Others, led by the ever-annoying Ben, are basically a bunch of thugs dressed up like suburbanites. They're definitely a disappointment after two seasons of mystery.Moreover, we don't really get any payoff from the storyline about The Others. The season ends and it's still not really clear what they're doing or why. All we know about Ben is that he always lies. Frankly, Ben makes Jack, Locke, and the rest of the crew look like fools far too many times. I nearly found myself screaming ""Just shoot Ben already!"" at the TV.Overall, season 3 is a letdown from the high standards of Lost. Fortunately, the show picks up in seasons 4 and 5."
5,As expected,"The season showed up as expected in perfect condition. That being said, the content of the disks is certainly worth it. Even if you weren't a fan of every storyline, or every character, the series was good. You can't take that away from it. As such, I'm glad that I can add it to my library."
5,Best TV Series ever. I've never been addicted to this show!,"The product came as described, brand new in packaging. Disks weren't used yet, which is good.Season three is a lot of adventure."
5,Finally! The Greatest Show In HD !,"With a show like Lost where there are so many vivid colors and beautiful beaches (not to mention women) it needs to be in high-def to fully appreciate it! Thank you disney for stepping up and releasing it on Blu-ray, I just pre-ordered it. I had the enjoyment of watching season 3 of Lost in HD and let me tell you it rocked my socks! sadly I don't own a tivo so I only got to watch it once when it aired on HD. I'm looking forward to finding out what exclusives with be on the Blu-ray version because I read they are putting extra things that won't be on the DVD version. And of course I am drooling at the thought of season 1 and 2 on Blu-ray in the near future! but for now December 11th can't come soon enough!"
5,love this show/3rd season is great,"Beginning of this season is not so great and it takes probably till the middle of it to really start getting into it again. By the end of the season you craving more information and, like usual, it ends you wanting more and more. Love this show and this season is great."
1,Lost 3,Ordered on Sept 15th and still have not recieved it more than a month later..sent emails to no availwhat a rip-off
4,The Series starts to slow,"I have the benefit of watching this series for the first time without having to wait a week between episodes. If I had been watching it live, I would have wandered away by now. Watching each episode in quick sucession will tide me through this season as I am told season four picks up again."

5,Increds,"LOST season 3, just like every other season of LOST was amazing. Sure it had it's downfalls like the finale when a certain character may have possibly died. But I don't like to think or talk about that."
1,Never buy from this seller,"As with the other poor victims of this false vendor, I have not received my product. Luckily there is the A-Z from amazon. Never buy from this person, ever. You will not get your product and the process to file a claim takes a while for results to show."
3,Ehhh...,"If you're LOST obsessed, then you probably liked the 3rd season. If you're just a normal television watcher who enjoyed the first season but thought the second season was too over the top and strayed away from what you loved about the show...well, the third season didn't help anything.Also, the third season sees LOST desperately relying on suspenseful endings that I guess are suspenseful because there is loud music and the camera pans really quickly. However, not even the directorial cues can hide the fact that the show's story is anemic at this point.There is a reason why this show took a seriously ratings hit this year, cause its just too rediculous to be believed."
5,Simply The Best Show on Television,"L O S T is the best show on television and probably one of the best television shows ever. This season is of course nothing short of excellent, the first six episodes are almost like a Lost mini-series, with the ending being one of the best climatic cliffhangers ever, and the seventh episode comes back with a vengeance which blasts off the rest of the season. If season one was survival and season two was the hatch then season three is exploration. And if you thought the season opener for season two was insane you haven't seen anything yet! You haven't already watched Lost on TV and are planning on waiting for the DVD and watching it straight through you are really lucky, thats the way to do it, personally I'm too addicted to do it.Favorite episodes includeEnter 77Not in PortlandFlashes Before My EyesOne Of UsThe Brig"
5,Love it!,This was such a good season! I have to say Jack's not my favorite any more :(. So sad when this season was over. I can't wait much longer for season 4 to start.
5,Lost - I JUST LOVE THIS STUFF!,My husband and I watched the whole season over a weekend and wished there were more.
5,WOW!,"when i first bought this season ,i was not Excited to watch it ,i thoughtthat it gonna be worst than season 2,but when i finally decided to watchit, i couldn't stop watching it. Its much better than season 1 & 2 (MUSTOWN),its worth every dollar i spent. And the season finale when i firstwatch it i was like what the hell!!!best episode everCant wait for season 4"
3,Slow to start,"The series gets a little off focus in the middle of the season, but it sets up the fourth season well. If you are a Lost fan it is a must."
5,Lost item,"I did not receive my order on time, I had to call amazon twice before the problem was fixed. It is kind of ironic that my 3rd season of Lost got lost!!"
5,Out of the Hatch and into the Others!,"Well, after getting out of the Hatch now the series takes us to the lives of the Others. Whole new world opened up after they introduced the Others. This was perhaps the most mysterious season of Lost. We learn the lifestyle of Others, and how crazy Ben really is and how everything started. The season was better directed than the second season. Which I think was little dull in the middle, still great season though. Coming back the third season, alot of things have been revealed to us and more questions arise...not surprisingly. The last three episodes are probably the best episodes of this series so far. Especially the last one. When we witness the biggest shock of all. Great Season."
1,"Lost, up in smoke shame to waste your time","When it aired millions chased the smoke monster and other devices left orphaned by the writers down the vortex. Instead of buying these discs, consider watching replays of yesteryear stump speeches for free on the Tube."
5,Perfect,I have looked in many stores to complete my collection. This arrived in perfect condition... and I am very happy my collection is now complete. Everthing delived as promised !
5,Best season!,Lost Season 3 is the best season of LOST! Lots of reveals but builds even more mysteries leading to the cliff hanger season finale! Highly recommend this box set and if you can...watch it all in one sitting. It's worth the day off!
5,You'll be a blu-ray believer!,I hate LOST... but my wife and I bought this on a deal-of-the-day from Amazon for something to watch during the writer's strike... and WOW. It snagged me almost immediately.The quality of the picture and sound is definitely above what you get on an HD broadcast. Very worthwhile purchase!
5,Can't wait for Season 4!,"This season was simply awesome! Everything, including the first 6 episodes were great. People complained cause they focused to much on Jack, Kate and Sawyer and not enough on the rest of the castaways but when you watch the whole season those episodes were extremely important. They set everything up so then the series can really end with bang. This season saw the castaways finally out of the hatch and exploring more of the island like in season 1. The tone of the show lighten up a bit, i think there was a bit more humor in this season that the last one.Answers that the fans wanted started finally coming, like the secret of Jack's tatoo, how Locke ended up in a wheelchair, who would Kate choose. New questions were also brought up as we move into the final half of Lost. The best thing about this season? The finale. It is truly as the producers said, ""a game changer"". Can't wait for Season 4!"
5,Where are the Other Seasons?!,"I have many Spanish relatives who would enjoy the ""ENTIRE"" show, so WHERE are the First Two Seasons, guys?"
5,just my luck.......,Season was really cool... VQ is amazing... but my 5th disk was actually the first disk labeled as the 5th. what the hell
3,"LOST in hi-def is great...getting two of the same disc, not so great.","Being a fan of the show LOST, I greatly anticipated this set, especially because it's on blu-ray, the best that HD has to offer. As I expected the picture was razor sharp and the sound was crystal clear. But watching through the set, Discs 1-4 were fine, just as they should be, but when I popped in disc 5 expecting to watch the next episodes. To my dismay, it was the same content as disc 1, only mislabed as disc 5. Regrettingly I had to send the set back to Amazon for a replacement. Keeping my fingers crossed hoping to finish season 3 of this great series."
4,If you love Lost cant beat it in HD,Lost Season 3 was a great season with the usual cliff hangers.The first time Lost was available on DVD in High Def. Doesnt look much clearer from the High Def tv show but still great to enjoy on your Blu Ray player if you are a fan of lost.Would be nice to get Lost Season 1 and 2 in Blu Ray as well to complete the collection thus far.
2,a little disapointed,The first and second season DVDs are 100% better than this set. I wish they wouldn't bother doing commentaries over some of the eps. if they only plan to sit and laugh at inside jokes the whole time. It's annoying. It¡s obvouis they don¡t want to really talk about the show because they don¡t want to give anything away. Fine. But don¡t even bother with it if that¡s your goal. It just seems like they phoned it in on this set.
1,Cannot Say,I am now completely fed up waiting for this package to arrive. I would like you to refund my credit card in full. Should your package ever arrive I will send them back to you if you give me instructions on how to do so?
1,Why is Hurley still fat?,2 years of being stranded on an island should work wonders for obesity unless one of the revelations is that there is an invisible McDonald's there.
4,One of my favorite shows ever,"I'll assume if you are looking at Season 3 of LOST you probably have seen Seasons 1 and 2 already.(No SPOILERZ)This season is great. I gave it four stars because I don't think it is at the level of seasons 1 and 2. It is still better then almost any other series I have seen. There is a point in the middle of the season where the story drags on a bit but it picks up towards the finale.If you love Season 1 and 2, you will probably like 3 as well!"
5,Not just for babies,"Ms. Hickey has included designs in this book that are very simple and quick to make but produce fabulous quilts for anyone of any age. It all depends on the fabric you choose to work with. Bottom line: Mary's designs make great quilts for babies and kids but with a change in fabric, they also become great gift quilts: stunning to look at but quick to make."
4,A great quilt book with lots of options.,"The title of this book is exactly what you'll find inside. Mary Hickey gives concise clear directions with patterns that could be transformed into a lot of different quilts from baby to adult. She has helpful hints scattered through the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves quilting, from beginner to expert."
5,Amazing For Statistics!,This book is amazing - There are so many Excel tricks for statistics that are in no other book - because of this book I am a much better Excel Statistics teacher!!
2,Excel for Scientists and Engineers,This book is short on content and give you list of formula names and descriptions. Most of this information can be found online in the excel help. I was looking for a more robust and detailed book. It was realtively inexpensive and you get what you pay for in this case.
3,"Good so far,, however not enough info on lookup tables","The book has some intresting topics however, they are more geared towards data analysis. I was looking for examples of lookup tables which this book only covers for half a page...."
1,Not a True Story...,"I have read every book written about Jim Morrison, and the story that Ashcroft writes does not mesh with any of Morrison's life history. I have kept every single book about him, but this book was so unbelievable, that I threw it away.Ashcroft portrays Morrison as a pedafile that wants to marry her, and she claims to be the only woman (really a child @ 15) that he wants for all eternity.My guess is that Ashcroft was one of his want to be groupies, that never got anywhere with him, except in her childhood fantasies. I doubt that she ever met him, or even attended any of his concerts.Oh, and I almost forgot. She claims to have written his music with him, and she claims to be a genius just like him. LOL...If you like a fictional story about the fantasy mind of a 15 year old child, then it is a fairly good book. If you want a book about Jim Morrison, this is not it. I hope this review helps you in your choice."
1,Uh-Oh.....,"You mean there are still people on this planet who haven't read Salli Stevenson's expose of this book? I can't believe any real Doors fan would take this book seriously! Lets get real, Linda's ""story"" has been compared to the Doors actual itinerary, and it doesn't add up or stand up. The Doors were on the road MOST of the time Linda claims she was with Jim in CA. Only those who enjoy reading romance novels might feel satisfied with this tripe. If you want any real truth on Jim, skip this! Linda doesn't have truth, just her imagination. It's well-written, but I want facts on my favorite musicians, not school-girl fantasy."
1,Do not buy this [book!!!],"I bought this book, and I have stopped reading it because I don't believe any of it. The book is almost 600 pages long, andI frankly don't want to waste my time reading something that might be total [not good]. The author gives no evidence that she even new jim no photos, just some copy of a paper that she says jim gave her. Some of the stuff this lady claims is just so outrageous that it's incredible. For example, Morrison showed up at her house. So bottom line the author gives no credible evidence that she even new jim so don't waste your time reading this. Read ""Angels dance and Angels Die."" or ""No one here gets out alive."" Linda Ashcroft go sell your lies somewhere [else!!!]"
1,Total Fiction,"An overblown romance novel masquerading as fact. If Linda Ashcroft (and her truly colossal ego) ever set eyes on Jim Morrison it was in concert. She and the equally mendacious Patricia Kennealy (""Strange Days"") ought to be horsewhipped for painting Pamela Courson as a murderess and themselves as the inspirations for or even co-authors of virtually all Morrison's songs and poetry.Anyone interested in discovering the truth about these two fantasists should go to the Doors Collectors Magazine website and click on the appropriate links."
3,Love Story,"Beautifully written love story - If you love Jim you want to believe this book, I cried all the way through it. However, I have to say like many others, I don't believe a single word of it is true. Linda has (conveniently) absolutely no evidence, photos or people still alive to corroborate one single word of her story. Nor does she get a mention by any other person linked to Jim. If he loved her so - someone else would have known about it!"
2,No Way,"This book does NOT read like a memoir. It reads like fan fiction. It is a beautifully written love story, but, so obviously NOT based on any relationship with the real Jim Morrison. If this book was published as fiction, I would give it five stars. That being said, I'm giving it one star for being well written, and one star for having Jim Morrison as the hero/romantic lead. I'm not saying this book isn't worth reading. If you have ever listened to the doors, or listened to an interview with Jim Morrison, and longed to know what it would be like to have the amazing artist/poet treat you as his muse, this book is for you. If you are looking for a factual biography and insight into what life with the REAL Jim Morrison was like, skip this one."
4,Her claim about the meaning of the song 5 to 1 is not convincing,Great storytelling but I just didn't buy her claim about the significance of the song '5 to 1'. I won't post a spoiler by revealing her conclusion but all the lyrics show that it's a literal anthem to revolution. Everyone who could confirm her story is conveniently dead. I still recommend this book.
4,Wild Dreaming,"I'm giving this 4 stars for the beautiful writing, what a pity Linda Ashcroft & her publishers labelled this book as non-fiction. She has the capabilities to be a wonderful writer of novels, which is of course what this book is. A powerfully evocative recreation of the intensity of teenage feelings & fantasies, with barely a fact in sight. I know the saying is ""if you can remember the 60s you weren't there"", but it's too unlikely that nobody from that era remembers Morrison's underage friend.Forget the outrageous claims & enjoy the classic story of the unawakened girl & the man nobody knows except her. Perhaps the writer will make enough money to get some therapy & develop her undoubted talents."
1,interesting fiction,"I enjoyed this book not for its revealing look into Jim Morrison's life and certainly not for its literary value. If read as a fictional love story, it's okay. If you really want to take it as truth, that's your choice, but I happen to know that it never happened. In fact, Jim Morrison's parents stopped the book from being sold in the UK because it contained so many untruths. (She claims that she tried to have sex with him at the age of 15. Was Jim capable of statutory rape?)You can decide. If you want an okay love story, read this book. If you want something that's more about what Jim Morrison was like, read Patricia Kennealy-Morrison's Strange Days."
1,a very bad fiction book,"I can't believe People actually believe anything this so called ""Linda ashcroft"" wrote. This is just as bad as Patricia K's book. I mean, where did Jim really fine these women, who are now, making money off of his good soul. These two ladies(can we actually call them ladies) are only out there for the money. How can they claim they own Jim's heart, when everyone knows he only Loved Pamela Courson.Don't buy this book, if you need to read it, just borrow it somewhere. Don't let these ladies make more money off of Jim Morrison. Buy Instead ""the Lords and The New Creature's"" instead. All dedicated to his real wife Pamela Courson Morrison."
3,deluded,I read this book many years ago after having consumed so many other books that were in or around the same as 'No one here gets out Alive'...so you get to know the in the short lifespan of the doors or at least a good idea of Morrisons footprints...all I could think of when I was reading this was .. did jim morrison have a double...could he be in two places at the one time...I was almost wishing at one stage that she was telling the truth because I feel so sorry for Jim that maybe if this book were true then he did indeed have some kind of sober normal life away from all the madness....but alas it does not take too many pages to figure out that this ladys mind is in overdrive....another review here mentions that if she sold the book as fiction that it would make a great read....I thoroughly second that.......Declan Harding
1,Where are my red slippers?,"Oh.... my.... God!!!! There is another Patricia Kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind. I thought one Patricia was enough. But after reading this book, I am faced with the frightening realization that there are TWO of them!Also, what I find very disturbing is that this version of Patricia may be even daffier than the original version. After reading just 6 or 7 pages of this hallucination horror show it was evident to me that the author is suffering from a case of Patriciaitis and a dose of Kennealyism.By the 40th page I was searching for my red slippers so I could click them together and get back to Kansas. Or anywhere else, as long as my copy of this book didn't make the trip with me. A pack of lies and a waste of paper and time. I would rather read Mary Poppins than wade through this endless journey of rubble."
4,At Last!!,"This is the book I hungered for. The simple honest truth! Of all the books I have read on Jim Morrison, this one at least shows no exaggeration of his wild life and by the end of this book I felt I had known Jim Morrison for who he truly was a poet,rock star, sensitive person who could love and who also felt human pain who was torn apart from so many different worlds. Linda Ashcroft's meanings behind some of the songs was very helpful. The only thing troubling me is that the dates don't seem to match up with the rock stars schedule back then?? I found myself reading this book twice."
5,best book ever written,"This is the second review i have done for this book, the first being for the edition that is available in the uk. All i can say is read the book, you will cry, you will smile. I have never been so deeply inspired as i have been by Linda Ashcroft's book. It has everything a true doors fan would want to read about Jim. PLEASE DO ME A FAVOUR and just read it, your life will never be the same again. WONDERFUL BOOK."
1,Wild Child: Arthur Rimbaud,"Arthur Rimbaud was known as the ""Enfant Terrible"" or terrible child, as referenced in wild child.Do you remember when we were in Africa is a reference to Rimbaud's time spent in Africa and the fact that Morrison felt he knew him. Buy this book with caution!"
2,More Holes then swiss cheese,"This is not a bad book if it was presented for what it was FICTION. This women has NO hard evidence to support her claims. Everyone that can substantiate her story are all...well,dead...all evidence to support her relationship with Morrison have all been...well, stolen and no one in Morrison's intimate circle (that are still alive) have ever heard of her.I would never say she never met Morrison, it is possible...but it is clear this ""true"" love story is more or all imagination and no reality. The reader will begin to doubt from very early on when the author clearly uses specific dialogue as if writing a play...Memory is one thing but to remember word for word dialogue from 30 years before seems ridiculous to say the least..I could have made a similiar claim and built a whole story around a love affair even though I was born AFTER he died..after all I have just as much ""evidence"" as the author does..."
2,Hmmmm...,"I've just finished reading ""Wild Child"" and am quite disappointed. It's not as well written as I'd anticipated from reading other reviews, and although I see myself as a romantic, her story was too saccharine even for my tastes.I will withhold my personal thoughts as to the validity of her account, not having known any of the parties involved, but it would seem odd that a brilliant, chivalrous, needy, tortured alcoholic could be as one sided as he is portrayed in this book. I'm more likely to recommend Patricia Kennealy- Morrison's memoir to those interested in learning more about Jim Morrison. It was infinately more readable and leaves the reader with more insight into who Jim Morrison really was."
3,WHERE'S THE PROOF???????,"It probably wouldn't be that difficult to say you had an affair with Jim Morrison (I'm certain many did) but a ""relationship"" is another matter. Although this book certainly qualifies as an interesting read, Ms. Ashcroft fails to provide any proof that anything more existed. Come on, if I was dating a famous rock star, I'd probably have at least ONE picture to show. Of course there is the obligatory break-in where all evidence (including the wedding rings!) was stolen....It was amazing that they went right to the closet where everthing was stored, took the evidence and left the closed box to be found by the author at a later date ....Call me a skeptic, but I'm just not convinced."
4,You'll Be In Late 60s San Francisco Via Kansas,"West Coast styled US 60s from Lawrence Kansas with complex melodic vocal harmonies, spaced out guitars and good original dreamy and melodic songs. Good all around album if you're into the style of music."
1,"wasste of money, BIG clean up due to orange dye","I had exact same one, mine is orange, and block doestnt dissolve quickly enough, thank goodness because my tank would be an even bigger mess, but it definitely ruins your water, everything will be orange....save your money, I am doubtful mine even worked, I can see the clusters of food that are attached inside the block and after five days mine had fizzed down to just 90% , if that...dont waste your money , do an auto feeder while your away, cheap one can cost $10 bucks at walmart"
2,Orange Dye,"I read the review from the person who said it turned their tank orange before ordering and thought that they must have had some other problem. I've used the small white block feeders in the past without problems, and didn't understand how this one could turn anything orange. Now that it has arrived, I see that the picture of a white squid shaped feeding block is misleading. The thing is actually dyed an orange color. I'm wary to use it because I don't want it to stain my tank an orange color and face the troublesome cleanup the other reviewer had to."
5,I really think this product works!,My son has Synovitis in his hip and since starting this product he has had less pain and falls due to his hip giving out. It has really worked!!!
4,Overall pretty good,This product provides the basic nutrients needed for good joint health. So far so good.
5,"I Love, Love this book.","The ""Creative Guide to Color & Fabric"" book is great. I had lost my whole collection of these during a move and am so Thankful to be able to replace them. Yes I would recommend this book to anyone who quilts."
2,Good and Bad,I have owned this book for awhile. It is a good overview of metal smithing but it is very weak on details. It is extremely difficult to actually make any of the items shown if you haven't seen them done by an instructor. I definitely would not recommend this book for anyone who is a novice and wants to make jewelry based on its instructions.
4,great place to start!,"This is a great book, specially if your are just starting. It has great advice of all sorts and it guides you step by step in the process of making with very easy to follow drawings and explanations. I highly recommend to anyone intrested in small scale metalsmith or jewelry making. It even tells you how to lay out your workshop."
3,Survery of jewelry techniques,"You will have difficulty learning to make jewelry using this book. It is more of a lightweight survey of techniques than a ""how to do it"" book. It can serve as a reminder for those who already know a technique but haven't done it in a while.When I first started making jewelry I bought the earlier edition and found it woefully lacking in depth in some ares, especially choosing torches and soldering. The new book has more topics but not much more depth. The sections on soldering and torches are still too superficial to be useful to either the novice or expert. It is much more of a student guide than a ""Professional Edition"". If you want more depth in a survey book get Jewelry Making for Schools, Tradesmen and Craftsmen by Murray Bovin."
4,Good reference,This book covers a wide range of metalwork activities. Good practical advice. Good illustrations. Nice to have the reference tables in the back in a handy place.
4,Very complete and technical book,"This book is very complete and technical. I would recommend it for someone who is serious about learning metalsmithing. I am a beginner myself, and some topics are beyond my ability. However, I think the book will be a great reference for a long time as continue to learn."
5,Complete metalsmith,Extremely comprehensive and clues given to different processes and the use of tools and elements. Great purchase and I would recommend it to anyone getting into jewellery.
4,complete coverage,"The book is very professional. Nicely hardbound and the pages are quality. The information covers just about everything to do with metal smithing. Only problem I can see is a lack of depth to each subject or photos showing the actual process. It doesn't go in depth on any one subject, but is a good reference."
2,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","The Good: Complete Metalsmith by Tim McCreight is an excellent basic text for the beginner jewelry maker. Overall it should probably be purchased by every hobbyist with an interest in working with metal in jewelry making.The Bad: Too much subject matter is condensed to a single page or even a single paragraph. Topics such as gold leaf and its application and enameling are much more complex than the single page definitions Mr. McCreight offers his readers.The Ugly: Because metal smithing goes beyond the simple jewelry making techniques and methods described in this book, Mr. McCreight chose a very misleading title for this book. Additionally many of the methods and techniques described fit better in a basement crafter's arsenal than in a professional metal smith's shop."
5,Perfect,"I'm a fairly new jewellery designer, while I'm not a 'jeweller' I do design and produce high quantity runs and I really needed to learn more about the materials, processes and finishes that are possible.This book has already become a favourite and I've only had it a few days. It is a relief to finally find a book that explains itself without being over the top, nor child like. The author just tells you how it is. This is a perfect book for students, professionals, or hobbyists.Thank you for making it."
3,Adorable (at least),"Another beautifull french singer , Zazie gave a fresh new prespective of what European pop can sound like with Zen. She has this genuin female voice which make her songs sound as sensational as they do. Her lyrics are poetic and in a way humorous ( "" a duck in the coffee !... "" she sings on the tittle track ) . Pop teaser "" Un Point C'est toi "" and majestic rock ballad "" Larsen "" are some of the tracks you should pay special attention to . In conclusion ""Zen"" is a record easy to love and unfair to ignore."
3,Weight Loss,It is beautiful relaxing music and helps me in falling asleep. I cannot tell that it has helped in any other way and definitely not in helping to lose weight. It just seems like one of those relaxing sound CD's to me.
2,Hard on the ears,"The first half of this CD is hard to listen to. Although music is a matter of personal taste, I find this music to be extremely irritating and grinding on the ears. It is played in a high scale on piano (electric or synthesized?) and I find myself passing over 1st half of CD missing the subliminal opportunity. Second half is fine. Subsequently, effectiveness can't be fairly assessed."
3,Where are the results?,"The music on this CD is innocuous even pleasing and you do know exactly what subliminal suggestions are being made, but I've been listening to it for several weeks pretty regularly and nothing new. No more exercise, no better diet, nothing! Maybe I'm not susceptible to subliminal suggestions........"
1,Swanmom,This rarely can play. The disc is so thin the player has an issue reading it and it skipped first time playing. I would not buy this product line again.
4,Easy to listen to,I've had the CD for about 2 weeks and am listening to it daily. It is very easy and enjoyable music. I feel like my desire for chocolate and candy has diminished has been eliminated. I will continue to listen and trust that all my cravings for sweets will diminish as well.
3,Wasn't A Great Fit,"The tape is certainly relaxing to listen to, but I just couldn't dedicate that much of my time to listening to a CD. It instructs you to sit in a quiet place where you are unlikely to be disturbed, and that's incredibly hard for me to do. I thought I'd be able to listen to it in my car on the way to work, but the instructor says it isn't safe to drive while entering into such a ""deep state of relaxation."" The CD has a very positive message, but I wasn't impressed."
2,Weight Loss: Brain Wave Subliminal,"It sure puts you to sleep, but as far as losing weight, I don't think so. I was very disappointed."
3,Kinda boring,"I found this subliminal message CD a little boring. This one didn't inspire me, just because there was no talking on a conscious level. Howell's CD may be good for falling asleep to, but I want to be inspired as I drift off to sleep. I haven't listened to it more than a handful of times, so I don't know whether it would be helpful for weight-loss. Just can't get past the dull sound."
1,What Crap!,"This is nothing more than a spa music.....total crap not even good spa music!How can spa music help weight loss, gimmick!"
5,5 Stars because it Works,"I started listening to this during my morning commute during the first few weeks. Now I listen to it a couple of times a week. In the last three months, my eating habits have changed and I've cut out alot of sweets and extra calories. My actual weight loss has been gradual (about 7 lbs), but that's why I like it. I didn't need to lose much and wanted to eat better. Now I do. I highly recommend."
3,pretty good,Not too bad but a little over priced. Don't like that the leg bottom doesn't have an elastic hem. The weight is good for everything except summer.
3,Maybe different people get different products when they order these?,"The reviews for this product, and many of the Champion sweat pants sold by Amazon vary tremendously. Some people say they are too light weight and others say they are good quality heavy weight. It makes me wonder if everyone is getting the same thing when they order these? Does anyone know? Have you every ordered the same pants a second time and gotten something different?"
5,"Champion Men's Double Dry Classic Fleece Pant, Black, X-Large","The product was delivered timely, exactly as described. Quite frankly, a better product than I expected for the price. The pants fit well, were long enough and very comfortable. I would purchase from this seller again and recommend them to others."
4,Pretty good sweatpants.,These are nice sweatpants and I would probably buy them again. Elastic in the bottom of the legs at the ankle is average. They have a string in the waist band that can't be lost and the pockets are a nice feature. I'm also going to use them in cold weather hunting as a layer because of their wicking ability.
5,Good Quality,"I bought these for my husband a few months ago. He is very picky with sweats. So far, no complaints. They are warm, have held up well, and look great on him. They do have pockets and elastic at the bottom."
1,NOT true to size,NOT true to size. Measured against another pair of Champion Fleece pants and waist band is the same but the seat is a GOOD 6-8 inches smaller. Quality control messed up on these.
5,functional sweatpants,"These are functional sweatpants that keep you dry and warm in vigorous activities. These pants dry quickly and help wick moisture away from the skin. I wear them in the coldest winter months and with proper layering, have no problems while walking in conditions between 50 degrees and 10 degrees. These pants have excellent material and a top grade construction."
1,Disappointed,"I have been a long term purchaser of many Champion products, so it was without hesitation that I madethe purchase of the Men's Double dry fleece pant which I use several times a week for my workouts.Unfortunately I was greatly dismayed when the stitching around the waist began to unravel afterabout 10 machine washings. I anticipate that they will be useless to me soon. This productdoes not seem to be up to ""Champion standards"" in my opinion. Too bad. I can not recommend."
2,No elastic in leg cuffs,"As others have said, they are much too long, and because there is almost no elastic in ankle cuffs, they slip down and hang off the bottom of the feet. I have to put some heavy-duty safety pins in the cuffs just to make them wearable."
3,Moderatley satisfied,"Only disapointment pertains to the elastic around the ankle which is not a snug as I would like. Otherwise, satisfied with purchase"
5,Oldie but Goodie for sure,This could be out of today's newspaper. Caruso and Franz deserved all those Emmys then and they would get them now if it were still on prime time.
5,NYPD Novice,"Episodes were realistic, the acting was good and the characters were believable. Gives you a feel for New York City."
4,Good police story featuring the political aspect,Jennifer Beal does a good job of acting and the story is mostly about the political aspects and personal aspects of the police. It has plenty of action also. I recommend it because besides being entertaining I think it reflects the complexity of the truth.
4,Robert H.,"Really enjoyed the 1st season. However, was not able to view one episode due an downloading error. One or two episodes displayed CC, but that function was not operating. Really find the CC function a plus due to my hearing issues when it is operating. I am enjoying the series though, a lot of entertainment through prime offering. Money well spent for all that Amazon offers."
5,Great Drama,This is one of the best police dramas I have ever seen. I truly enjoyed every minute of every show. I have ordered season two.
1,muy aburrida,"A mi me gustan mucho las series y peliculas policiacas, esta no me toco verla en su momento, pero me decidi comprarla por los buenos comentarios que lei aqui mismo, pero llevo cuatro capitulos y se me han hecho aburridos y repetitivos, creo que no voy a ver los que siguen por lo pronto, el sonido, la imagen y la traduccion al español estan buenos, la trama es la que no me gusto. Saludos y animo."
1,Try NYPD TV Trash.....,"This was the worst show on television. Dennis Franz can not act. Caruso had all the talent and personality of an oak tree. and the stories, it had none. Brain dead series for a brain dead TV auidence."
3,If Not for Caruso It would have been 5 Stars...,"Dennis Franz is spectacular in this role and with out question the reason the show was such a hit. Dennis Franz was there from the first through the last episode of ""Blue"" and just became better and better with each season. The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 5 is due to the presence of Caruso who only served to drag the show down. True acting genius is when a really nice guy has to play the part of a first rate Ass**** and manages to do it with a serious degree of humor, just as Dennis Franz did for the shows entire run. A miserable, self centered individual just acting the part is nothing special. I was glad to see Caruso go. Jimmy Smitts was a much better fit by far. Over all, it's the best Police drama ever. A series that was able to touch on if not explore every conceivable human emotion; giving due validity to all, while managing to keep it real."
1,Enhanced Regional Coding Suspected.,"Buyers outside the US, be aware that these Region 1 DVDs DID NOT PLAY on my DVD reader - although it ordinarily accepts all 6 regional encodings."
4,"Holds up very well, at least the first season","It's great to see the cutting edge editing and pace in a show as old as this one, and wonderful to see David Caruso before he became a parody of himself. This was network television with an adult and realistic vibe that can only be found, if at all, on subscription cable channels."
5,NYPD Blue is GREAT,Really enjoying watching Season I and looking forward to following seasons - used to watch this show all the time when it was on
5,NYPD Blue--One of the best series ever,"Rewatching NYPD Blue has been terrific. We can't stop watching. The writing is crisp and original. The casting is superb, and the acting is top notch. Seasons 1 through 4 are available on DVD. These might be a good purchase for the spring season since the writer's strike promises to give us a worse season than usual."
3,I love NYPD Blue!,I received the set but was extremely upset to find that the final disk was formatted different from all the rest and I can't watch it. I had purchased the set for a vacation with my husband and it really ruined the end of the vacation.
5,"Oh, How I Miss It!!!!",Today's drama series' cannot compare with this police drama. Dennis Franz is peerless! Every actor in the drama makes one believe they ARE the character they play. A must have series first to last. Regrettably we won't see it's equal any time soon.
5,LOVED IT!!!,"Best cop show in the world...just finished watching all 12 seasons and I gotta say it...loved it. Good stories, good acting and good show overall."
5,nypdblue season 1,"One of the best original cop shows. Enjoyed every minute of their cop speak. Also, it is one of the, if not, the first show on t.v. to show nudity. Just an all round good show. The cast was wonderful. So many t.v. and film stars got their start on this show. really enjoyed it and plan to invest in more seasons."
4,Good cop drama!,&#65279;This is television writing at a superior level. The stories in each episode mesh in a compellingway with the arc of the season. The actors are superior and well chosen. I particularly like thatthe actors are not Hollywood beautiful people but are more atypically attractive. The drawbacksto the series so far are the ham-handed music and the irritating device of jumpy camera work.These flaws were not enough to keep me from being enthralled by the series and looking forward to each disc.
5,Excellent DVD box set,This DVD box set is excellent! It is amazing how much more enjoyable the show is without the commercials.
5,Awesome Show,NYBD is a top notch show in my eyes.. When are they going to get the other seasons on DVD? Some of the DVD's out there are not that great...Love NYBD and sorry to see the series end this year 2005.
3,One of the best character developments.,I'd forgotten how captivating the characters are...glad I reviewed them...felt like old friends. And boy were they all young then!
3,cop show,"It,s OK . Did not watch it when it was on the major channel. Watch when in the mood and short f time."
3,Los illegales cometen el crimen de mezclar romance y calle,"Yo pase a oir la cuarta cancion ""como tu"" y la encontre muy buena, y al oir otra cancion de otro disco con Johnny Ventura yo esperaba algo parecido a Fulanito, que es decir una combinacion de rap, reggeaton, y merengue.Pues, estuve parcialmente correcto. Pero cuando el disco siguio empeze a oir baladas como parecidas a algo tocado por Franky J, o alguien en la ducha del gimnasio creyendose Franky J. Tal como no se mezcla el agua con el aceite, el romantico con callejero no mezclan tampoco.Pero no todo es malo aqui. Hay varias canciones con buenos ritmos de merengue, reggeaton, etc acompan~ados con buenas letras. El grupo tiene potencial, pero tienen que dejar eso de romanticos porque parecen ridiculos haciendolo."
2,"Read ""sex in America"" instead","The data in this book is deeply flawed. Reading this book will give you an inaccurate picture of what american sexuality is like. The data is responses from a survey in Redbook Magazine. The data is not timeless, nor is it correct. For full details, read ""Sex in America"", a fully designed and cross checked survey - and look at the differences in the numbers. Make up your own mind."
3,house of snot,"im glad i got this cheap,the dude does not shut up between songs, watchin the dvd is fine its funny and the tunes are good but you listen to the cd and you cant help but notice the singer never shuts up.if your a guttermouth fan get it, look for used."
1,POOR QUALITY - SHAME FOR G-SHOCK WATCHES,"AFTER 6-MONTHS OF USE, THIS WANNA BE G-SHOCK BROKE DOWN. TOOK IT TO A CERTIFIED G-SHOCK REPAIR CENTER, AND FOUND OUT THE WHOLE MODULE BURN OUT. IT'S AN OLD MODEL FROM 2001. AMAZON SHOULD CHECK THEIR SUPPLY BETTER AND ADVERSTISE THE YEAR MODEL ON THEIR PRODUCTS. WE PAY FULL PRICE FOR OUTDATED WORN OUT EQUIPMENT THAT YOU END UP PAYING MORE LATER THAN IF WE WERE TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE MANUFACTURER AND PAY THE FULL PRICE ANYWAY FOR A LEGITIMATE LATEST MODELS. VERY DISSAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON. I'VE BEEN A FAN OF G-SHOCKS FOR THE PAST 25-YRS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I GO AND BUY A G-SHOCK FROM A NON-CASIO LOCATION AND GOT BURNED!"
1,HORRIBLE,"reading this book i thought that i would learn about what happened at tiananmen square, but it is just a story about an american living in china. the whole tiananmen square section in the book lasts for about 2 pages in the very last chapter. in the end, the characters change to fit their roles. the punctuation in this book is also horrible, jack casserly did not proof read or edit this book, neither did anybody else. towards the end of page 262, the sentence starts off:""When T.G. awoke, t\The undertaker was already...""i dont know how 't\The' can make it past editors, on that page there is also two periods that are out of place.i did not learn a single thing from this book. nowhere on amazon did it say that it was a FICTION book, which it is. do not read this book, it will leave you upset and out $20"
3,The Word Is...Disappointment,"It's all about expectations. Knowing that Rhino was selecting tracks from throughout Yes's career, I expected they would pick only the best performances and best recordings. But much (most?)of this set is bootleg quality. Don't get me wrong, I love bootlegs. But the thrill of a good bootleg is hearing the entire concert as it happened, not select tracks. If Rhino had instead released a larger set (8 CDs?) featuring a full concert each from 71, 75, 80, 88, and making it clear that they would be bootleg quality, this would have 5 stars. Oh well. I will just put ""We Can Fly From Here"" on repeat and try to contain my disappointment."
2,A bootleg - in both sound & performance,"Am a MASSIVE Yes fan. Don't want to ever think I'd ever have even a small part in taking $ out of their pockets, but...this CD is very sub-par in both performance & especially sound quality. They obviously didn't have many master tapes to mix from; if they did please fire the mixing engineer now! It's cool as a collector of Yes recordings but beyond that, it's pretty awful. I so much wish I could say something different but I'd be lying. Very sad."
2,Should have a warning.,The Rabin era recordings sound decent but the rest sound like cassette recordings. Enjoyed the booklet but the audio is just too poor to justify the release.
3,thanks to the lapidarist...,"...but one correction re: the 'America' gem- it was not, in fact, wakeman who played keys on this track. believe ot or not, it was bruford. yes, bruford! wakeman was indifferent to the project, which was recorded for an atlantic records v.a. compilation and bill was willing and, obviously, at least competent to handle keys on the original studio track. otherwise, solid and helpful review from the jeweler!regarding the set itself, i feel that like many long-term fans i am in a poor position to give an unbiased review, as any unheard versions of even overplayed tracks are of interest to me. this is exacerbated by the fact that i am a guitar instructor, and love to hyperexamine steve's playing. i feel secure in stating that fans will want this; it just isn't the place to start."
3,Surprising YES concerts,"i like SHoot High AIm Low very much, also Yours is no Disgrace swinging. This live recordings are very different i never heard.I mean they play relaxing and dont know this concert been recorded."
4,"not flawless, but still essential for all you yes men (and women) out there","This compilation of live music is a real mixbag. Some performances dont sound that great do to poor audio quality, That being said when yes turns up the heat and does there thing NO ONE does it better. Im so glad they included tracks from the time and a word album. Many think there greatness started with the yes album but I think it started with time and a word. Disk two is the obvious highlight though, not only because of its audio but also because it includes the big medley a 20 plus minute epic featuring some of the best yes songs. Another bonus is tracks from the drama album that did not even make the drama LP. If your not super picky about sound and are a yes fan do not hesitate to buy this awesome collection of live music from one of the top 10 bands of all time."
2,THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF THE OFFICIAL BOOTLEG SERIES,"THERE IS NO EXCUSE IN THIS AGE OF DVDA, HDCD, SACD TO ISSUE SUCH BAD SOUNDING STUFF AND PRESENT IT AS A PREMIUM BOX SET. I THINK STUFF LIKE THIS WAS WHAT THE BAND HAD IN MIND WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED (AND THEN SCRAPPED) THEIR 'OFFICIAL BOOTLEG'SERIES.THE GRATEFUL DEAD LETS YOU KNOW THAT THEIR DICKS PICKS SERIES MAY NOT BE UP TO THE STANDARDS OF THE REGULAR RHINO RELEASES, SO THAT THE CONSUMER KNOWS WHERE TO SPEND THEIR MONEY. I FEEL CHEATED BY YES. I GOT THIS THE SAME DAY AS THE RHINO CHICAGO LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL BOX SET ($80 BUCKS FOR RHINO IN ONE DAY!) AND WAS ALSO DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SOUND. THE OLD 3 CD SET SOUNDED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME BUT THEY ACTUALLY BOTCHED THE DRUM SOUND ON THE NEW ONE. RHINO IS DEFINETELY SLIPPING."
4,Good effort overall,"This set is clearly aimed at serious fans who already have most other live product from Yes (and there's no shortage of it!) This explains the gaps covered by other releases such as Yessongs. For fans it's nice to hear the Crystal Palace material as well as the Drama stuff from MSG. And mercifully we're only given 4 tracks from the Trevor years. Plus I doubt that anyone will regret the lack of anything post '88, though one senses this collection merely scratches the surface and leaves the door open for follow-ups. One interesting observation: this set could have been subtitled ""The Revenge of Tony Kaye"" -- he's represented on this collection far more than even Rick Wakeman!"
2,And the word is....money,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Yes (See my other reviews) but with this release, they have gone too far on abusing fans.(Maybe the producer, not the band) It is a bootleg, the worst sound you can imagine.And the material is poor, do we really need other version of Yours is no Disgrace, I've seen all good people, Siberian Khatru, Roundabout or Awaken ? We already have high quality of theses on Keys to Ascension Vol 1 and Vol 2. I don't want to hear songs from the Drama tour...Be aware that this is really nothing more than a bootleg with some bad songs and be aware that the only good tracks can be founded elsewhere with a real hi-fi sound, no a poor quality one."
5,Why won't they release this in the NTSC format? We americans enjoy Jarre's music here too,"Jean Michel Jarre has even mentioned that he enjoys performing in America. So why isn't he making some sort of effort to get his DVD's released over here in the US?There are several Jean Michel Jarre shows that are available and viewable only in Europe. Jarre's ""Oxygene Moscow"" is the only NTSC DVD available in the US.I guess I'm going to have to invest in a Region Free DVD player if all my favorite artists are only available on DVD in Europe. This applies to Mike Oldfield too."
5,Good book,"Very informative, lots of references.One of the best sources for Mayhew.Details his life from childhood through his death. Good source for information on the American Revolution."
4,RECOMMEND FOR ARTHRITIC HANDS,"More pros than con. I normally use beaters on my mashed potatoes and needed something quicker and easier. Due to arthritis that creeps up periodically, the ergo feel to the handle is super accommodating. The masher does get into rounded areas nicely; however, I did have to shake off potatos several times at first that were in a big heavy blob thus the 4 stars (maybe I'm spoiled by the beaters). Clean up is a breeze. Other reviewers have used it on other vegetables and praise its production. The product itself is constructed to survive the test of time, so I plan to leave it behind to other generations as my relatives have left many treasures to me."
5,This Potato Masher really works!,"I tried several potato mashers and was not happy with any of them. This item is wonderful! It is sturdy and easy to use. This masher actually does what it is supposed to do -- mash potatoes and doesn't leave lumps. This was a difficult product to find, but the hunt was worth it. I just love it."
5,This Is A REAL Masher,"Like us, many have probably used the standard (similar in design but no comparison in construction) mashers. This one is as solid feeling as they can be built. No rust. No places for water to enter between the handle and mashing wire. Solid... If you want a real masher this is the one to get."
3,Pretty good garage-psych,1968 garage psych LP with some garagier pre-LP tracks added as bonus. Not compelling to my ears but not bad either.
5,Very meditative.,"I worked nights, this would help you block out the neighbor's kids and lawnmowers. I'm glad I bought it. It's very restful."
4,Quest 64 stratagy guide review,"This was a great book and helped me alot. It gives you where ALL the elements are, which is awesome. This has some in it that I've never seen on _any_ statagy guide before. Only the maps bring down the rank"
4,A good guide that needs map improving,"A good game with a good guide,the guide helped me with battling and other things.My one complaint is that the maps are very poor,they don't help me at all.Otherwise,the guide is great,just be prepared to travel with a bad map.Good Luck!"
2,Nothing original here as far as guides go.,"A decent guide overall it's focus is more on magic spells and battle tatics, and less on story which is a plus for some but not all. Good for people who don't want a guide full of ""spoilers."""
5,The first in-depth examination of McBride's popularity,"If you don't recognize the name of radio personality Mary Marget McBride, don't worry: she was one of the major radio show hosts of the 1940s and 1950s and had her own popular daily one o'clock broadcast where she interested presidents and famous personalities alike. Five decades after their broadcast her shows still hold relevance today: Susan Ware explores how Mary McBride influenced formats many talk shows still use, capturing the world of 1930s to 1950s radio broadcasting in all its social and political importance. It's One O'clock is the first in-depth examination of McBride's popularity and radio show, following both her life and upbringing and her impact on media as a whole. Susan Ware edits the biographical dictionary Notable American Women and is in the perfect position to lend depth and authority to McBride's achievements."
4,rock en español de pura calidad!!!,"Coda es uno de los grupos de rock en español con más calidad, ganador varias veces del premio a la mejor banda de Hard Rock en español por reconocidas organizaciones y revistas musicales. ""Enciéndelo"" es una muestra de buenas canciones, con letras bien hechas y un sonido bien logrado. Tono Ruiz, su guitarrista, ha dejado una profunda huella en el rock mexicano, y me atrevería a decir que Chava Aguiar, el vocalista, es una de las mejores tres voces del rock latinoamericano."
4,Good but not Classic,"Big Jack Johnson has made other records but this is his first without his band the Oilers. Kim Wilson was called into help produce an acoustic record with Jack Johnson and the result is this fine record. The set is a mixture of original tunes (Humming Blues,Lonesome Road),and some covers (Dust my Broom, My Babe)are done over well by Kim and Jack.I think though that it could have been done better, on some tracks Jack seems tired and almost unable to phrase vocally. Kim's in top notch shape though, but at times it seems that some of the magic slips away, he plays impeccably though and he is still probably the best old school blues harp player playing today. This record proves it(as do his other records).I like this album alot but I still think they could have done better. You should buy this record though, the performances are solid and its all from the heart. Thats all we ask for really isn't it?"
2,Ok at best,This is very geared to the process and structure. It gives little quality responses to typical oral board questions.
2,Disappointed,This CD player is a great toy to play with - when it works. My 3 1/2 year old is NOT rough with toys at all and ours is not working after only 7 months. The microphone fades in and out of not working and the CD player is now not working at all. It's a shame since our daughter loves to sing with a microphone. I will not buy this brand ever again.
2,doesn't work well at all,"My daughter really has wanted her own cd player, and she wanted one with a microphone. I chose this one because it was the lowest priced by a fair margin that I was able to find, but the old adage of getting what you pay for holds true. It won't play cd's with any surface imperfections AT ALL, including dust. It is also unable to cope with being moved at all when it is playing (that is assuming you can find a pristine cd to play in it), and stops for several minutes before starting the cd over. Very disappointing for my daughter; I am returning it and paying more for one that is better."
4,Great childs cd player,"I purchased this for my 6 year old daughter's birthday. She has really been enjoying it. The only complaint is that the cd stops momentarily when bumped. But, what can you expect from a childs toy? The sound is good and she loves being able to sing along with a real microphone!"
2,You get what you pay for!,"We bought this for our child last year. I had been eyeing the more expensive versions of this toy (by Chicco, for example, $60) and when I saw this one I snapped it up. BIG MISTAKE! The CD ""door"" seals shut with two small plastic hooks...less than a year later, one of the hooks has snapped off and it won't close! We'll be shelling out another $60 for the Chicco version this year because she LOVES it, sings along, really cute! But we've learned our lesson, that's for sure."
4,The M16/AR15 Rifle (A Shooter's and Collector's Guide),"Good book, very imformative and detailed, would recommend."
3,Additional title,I would recommendComplete AR-15/M16 Sourcebook: What Every Shooter Needs to Know (Paperback)by Duncan Longas an additional title you should check out if you are interested in the subject.
4,"Outdated, but good, concise technical info","Like the title says, most of the stuff pertaining to manufacturers, gear, and laws is pretty outdated. That being said, the run down of all the parts to the AR15 is solid and indispensable. Great as a general technical manual for AR15s. That, or your could get the Army/Marine Corps' FMs.I don't give it maximum stars simply because, while I was purchasing a revised 3rd edition, I assumed I would be getting up to date information, but I was sadly mistaken. Probably my fault for not researching better, but at this point, they need a 4th edition."
3,A good place to start,"This is a nice, little primer to whet your appetite for a more complete resource. The information is good, but with many gaps.For instance, there is a complete table of models, but it does not include dates of manufacture or serial number info, which renders it useless as a resource for collectors or even first-time buyers.Also, many details are missing and some things go unexplained altogether, which may be fine for those who already are experts, but this book seems aimed more at the novice.Still, it's an interesting read, which did answer many of my questions."
3,A different interpretation,"While the content may not be appropriate for high school classes and the story is slow, I showed part of it to a college class and liked the ""non-traditonal"" interpretation it provided. King Creon was well played. This is a good film if you like modern dance."
2,An uninteresting service report,"When I purchased this book I expected to read a detailed account about how life was in a World War II U-boat. Instead, this book is not more than a detailed report of attacks made by several submarines on Japanese ships. It can be somewhat interesting because it was written few years after the war and displays the time's state of mind, but the author's point of view is really uncritical, unsensitive and even cruel (sadistic) sometimes."
5,Spanish Class Work book,This was the brand new book required by my class. It was cheaper here than in the campus book store.
2,A disappointment.,I have several other translations of the Bhagavad Gita and I bought this one because I was looking for the most poetic rendering. This version is not it.
4,A Very Promising First Novel,"Mallinson tries, as he explains, to write an army counterpart to Patrick O'Brian's Aubery-Maturin series, and he very nearly pulls it off with this book. It is mostly a character study of his young Ensign rather than a book about war. Combat is limited to the very beginning and very end of the book, although the life of a cavalry officer is the main focus. Mallinson clearly intends to make a series of this book, but I am afraid he has run out of wars! O'Brian admitted regretting having started his series in 1800, leaving just 15 years for his characters' growth. Mallinson has started with the last battle of the Napoleonic Wars, so I'm not sure where he will go from here.Yet this book does stand alone as a good read. It certainly gives the reader an idea of the scale of the carnage at Waterloo."
4,First rate historical fiction with a welcome twist,"Nearly everyone agrees that Mr. Mallinson's extensive research and intimate personal knowledge of the life of a cavalry officer make this an engaging read. However, one aspect of this novel that has not been discussed much is the role of the Christian faith of the main character, Matthew Hervey and several supporting characters (from fellow soldiers to his pastor father and brother). Like many in England in the early 19th century, Hervey is a devout Christian. Hervey is written as one who views the world from a Protestant Christian perspective, and who strives to be faithful on the battlefield, at home, or wherever he may be. He is shown praying on the battlefield, quoting scripture, and meditating on Christian ethics and morality. The portrayal is honest and not in the least polemical. Christianity and Christians are not caricatured, but portrayed faithfully and engagingly. Thank you Mr. Mallinson for this welcome twist."
3,Refreshing read of what life's like in Wellington's Army,"The style of the writing unexpectedly reminded me of Jane Austin (The author even pays homage to Ms. Austin in the story), a fresh look at a simpler time. Like Austin's work it presented an idealized picture of what life's like back in the ""good ol' days"". If you are expecting cover to cover military action, then forget it. The only real action (Battle of Waterloo) occurs at the last 80 pages or so. The ""Flashman-esque"" explanation of historical events are much less satisfying than how Mr. Frazer might have handled it. There are detailed description of operations of a cavalryman, I wish the author would've included a glossary so I can understand some of the more obscure terms."
4,Life in the Early 19th Century,"A Close Run Thing is really about life in the early 19th century in Europe as experienced by a cavalry officer, and just a little about military combat. Patrick O'Brian's books take a stab at these topics, but inevitably turns to combat to carry the carry the story, and we all know that the hero will win. In contrast, Mallinson creates a hero who succeeds on intellect and compassion rather than unimaginable feats of courage and daring. Hervey is a real man struggling to live in a real world. O'Brian and Alexander Kent created characters who interacted mostly with the elite of the times. Mallinson spends many more pages having Hervey interact with more common people.The first few pages were tough going, but once I got going, I found the book difficult to put down. In addition to being fun, the book caused me to think about what it was like to live in those times."
1,Reads more like a bad romance novel than historical fiction,"Despite Patrick O'Brien's endorsement,comparisons to O'Brien's work are a far stretch.The characters are two dimensional and the author constantly strives to achieve a kind of cutesy authenticity by use of an arcane vocabulary much of it incomprehensible to a modern reader.It reads more like a bad romance novel than good historical fiction and in no sense remotely approaches the quality of O'Brien's work."
3,Good.. and bad and good and bad...,"Good: Fascinating subject. There's not nearly enough written about cavalry. Research that seems impeccable to me, a nonspecialist in the period. Essentially appealing characters and a plot where plenty happens.Bad: Mallison seems to eschew sensory description almost completely. We never learn what most of the characters look like. We never smell the black powder and the horse poop, see the colors of the banners, hear the roar of cannons -- and so on. Also, the pacing of the plot is strange -- several scenes which really should be ""shown"", such as Hervey's first reunion with his family after several years, are ""told"".Overall, I enjoyed this, and I suspect that the rough spots in Mallinson's writing may improve in later works."
3,Entertaining but not riveting,"One the whole, the novel was enjoyable: the characters were interesting, the plot moved well, and it wasn't too predictable - other than the outcome of actual events. Being a horse-person myself, I have always wanted to read more about the role of cavalry in Napoleonic-era fiction. (Bernard Cornwell never dwells upon the topic too long.)The elements of a great novel are all present, but somehow the book falls short of its potential. Perhaps, Mallinson tried to put too much into one book. I never felt that the plot was moving too slowly and would have liked to see the time in Ireland described in more detail.Overall, this book was worth reading, but I will examine closely the subsequent books in this series before deciding to purchase them."
3,Jackie the Animal Saver,"This book was alright, but it was a little boring. I wouldn't recommend this book to somebody who doesn't like animals. If you like to read Will Hobbs books then you will probably like this book then.This book is about a girl named Shannon and her brother named Cody. Their parents went on a trip for the summer and they have to go to their Uncle Neal's house. Neal has his own business of recessing animals. They have to live with him for the summer. Neal can't work because he gets hurt, so Shannon starts recessing the animals with Cody. Cody was witness Sept. 11, 2001, so now he is all worried because his parents are away. Can they survive a summer with out their parents? Read this book to find out."
2,Jackies wild Seattle,"Jackies wild Seattle is a adventure story about two kids that stay with their uncle in the summer in Seattle,Washington. Cody, Shannon, uncle Neal and they save animals. The two kids are the many caracters Cody and Shannon. Cody is the one saving all the animals. Shannon is the one woring about her parents. The plot of the book is that uncle Neal gets unjured and shannon has to save uncle Neal. On the way cody is the one saving all the animals. the authors styles is that he likes wrighting adventure books and the themes are that they save many animals and save their uncle. Its mostly sad range and the book is sick sometimes and also sad. I havent read a book related to the book. the book was a good adventure book I liked it. I didnt like that he saved a lot of bloody animals it was sick. the tipe of reader that would like this book is a person that is into adventure books."

Its mostly sad range and the book is sick sometimes and also sad. I havent read a book related to the book. The tipe of reader that would like this book ts a person that is into adventure story."
2,Schlock,"The dialogue in this book really bugged me. To me it was phony and read like a cheesy sit-com. In addition, as a parent, I couldn't get past the danger of the situations the children were consistently in. If it were real life, I think someone may called Child Services on Uncle Neal. If he had been a little more reluctant to take these kids on his rescues it would have added some tension between the characters. Instead of Shannon and Cody being sugary-sweet, they could have blackmailed their uncle. (""We'll tell our parents your secret unless you let us come with you!"") Shannon and Tyler could have been ""troubled youth"" together. Then the ending with them all falling in blubbery love with each other would have been a little less predictable. I wish I could recommend this book to children, since they'd love the wildlife aspect of it. Read Gary Paulsen instead."
3,why is it so slow,if you have spent as much time playing the first two as i have than you will tear your hair out when you play the game so much slower
3,Disappointed after the hype...,"After reading the previews and comments of other Amazon customers, this sounded like a game I couldn't live without. I bought it without trying it first, and it was the first time that I have regretted a game purchase on my Xbox system. The game has okay graphics, but the vehicle physics are somewhat lame (even for an arcade game), the gameplay is redundant and the only 2 standard controller schematics that they allow are both poor. I played the game through all of the ""X"" tests, which prime you for the actual game, and even after getting used to the controls & handling of the car I didn't have much fun with it. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the tests are much more fun than the actual game itself. The game's concept is a good one, but the gamplay just falls short IMHO. I only gave it a ""3"" rating because it's not a terrible game, and some people may actually find it to be a fun game. But my copy is going on e-bay..."
1,Stinks,Crazy Taxi 3 stinks on Ice same thing with the 2nd one. I only love the originial one. Do not buy this really really stinky game. It`s a big waste of 50 bucks. I will know not to waste money on a game like this again. This game is really bad. Only buy the original one.1.It has bad graphics.2.The people aren`t is cool.My opinion:Try it if you want but it`s a waste.I wish Crazy Taxi 2 and Crazy Taxi 3 never existed. The Original one Rocks And Roll!
4,"Solid, fun game - Recommended!","This is game is a must have if you are a fan of the Crazy Taxi series. It combines all the best elements of the previous Crazy Taxis but adds the element of Las Vegas. If you've never played Crazy Taxi and enjoy fast, frenetic driving action then I highly recommend giving Crazy Taxi a whirl. The controls are easy to pick up and the minigames provide a handy tutorial for learning the necessary cool moves to get through a course easily."
4,Wow...,"Vavrus' book outlines systematic methods for teacher-educators to facilitate radical classroom transformation. His precise critiques aim to dismantle status quo pedagogical methodology...and they succeed. Instead of stopping at debunking educational mediocrity, though, Vavrus uses his analyses to provide a framework for what teaching methods create success in schools.I highly recommend this book to any teaching program that wishes to produce dynamic professionals!"
1,DID NOT ECEIVE ITEM,I cannot rate this product BECAUSE I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT.Have not been able to find a venue to report this!!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON BECAUSE YOU ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT THEM AFTER THE PURCHASE.....
5,It has me dancing around the house...,Seriously funny!!! And the music is a blast! It's good campy fun and definitely something that I wouldn't mind letting the kids watch.
2,Two and half for effort,"SAw the film at a festival -- it's okay. Kind of funny but it wears thin. Be warned if you buy the DVD, however Heddy Burress is cool to see -- She was in Boston Common. Which she was in more films. And Kellie Martin is pretty cool too. It's not bad, it's just not great..."
1,THE TERROR OF OPEN HOUSE - TRUST THE 1 STAR REVIEW,"I was suckered in by the 5 star reviews and chose to ignore the 1 star (and only honest) Amazon review on this DVD. Needless to say, the 1 star review and everything stated in it is correct --but I would like to add something: Now it looks like the ""filmmakers and their cronies"" are putting a few additional reviews to their pseudonyms to make it look like they're real reviewers. This can't be the case. Even if you forgave all the flaws of Open House you would NEVER give it 5 stars! Now, I love independent film but hate it when it is absolutely merciless in its ineptitude. This is one of those films; just do yourself a favor and avoid it."
4,Mindless fun,"Open House is a very very silly movie, but that is what makes it so fun to watch. Anthony Rapp is really the best part but the ""sexy Swipers"" are quite enjoyable too.It is by no means the best movie ever, but it is really a lot of fun to watch and is something that you can watch more than once and catch some things you didn't in the first viewing!"
3,Open House is fantabulous,"My cousin and I rented this movie for New Year's Eve, wanting to A: not have to watch the New Year's Eve shows all night and B: want to see Anthony Rapp in something outside of RENT. Watching the first few seconds of the movie, I thought it was cute, but a little bizare. However, as the movie progressed and the plot went along, I found it to be very cute and funny movie. Of course it is no Casablanca, but it is a good movie. People nowadays go in to the theatre expecting every movie to be done the same way, and it is not so for OPEN HOUSE. OPEN HOUSE takes a step out of the box and has come up with a clever plot line, with mostly cute, yet sometimes predictable lyrics. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. :-D"
4,Great Start For Schnauzer Lovers,"This book gives good insight into what you can look forward to when owning a mini of your own. I had my schnauzer for 11 years from when I was 8 to 19. My sweet dog had to be put to sleep because of health problems though. In tribute to him I can say that owning a schnauzer will greatly imrpove the quality of your life. Read this book, learn what to expect, then go out and get a mini of your own and enjoy the never ending love that this dog will bring you."
4,Good but not the best,"This series is captivating, but the quality is somewhat varied. I suppose that it's hard to maintain the same interest throughout a series as long as this. I'd equate Lambdin with O'Brian."
2,Roger's review,Disappointed with this adventure as felt author used too much padding and not sufficient flow of the story. Although background detail is important I felt the attempts to captivate dialects made the reading very sluggish.I'm about to start on 'The King's Captain' and hope that this gets back to a good rollicking type yarn.
5,A worthy successor to Forester and O'Brian,"I have recently purchased not only this book, but the entire series. Dewey Lambdin is a worthy successor to O'Brian and Forester although with a touch more explicit sexuality and a streak of 'Flashman' as well. Alan Lewrie, like Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey before him, is witness to and participant in some of the major actions of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars with fascinating side trips to China and the West Indies between the wars and illuminates some of the lesser known aspects of those times."
5,The joy of sects,"Who says comparative religion has to be dull? Mencken is on his best behavior here, but his characteristic flash and dazzle light up the book. As ""The American Language"", reflects Mencken's enduring interest in words, so this book reflects his fascination for religion in all it's varieties from high-toned to gaudy. While innumerable histories of religion have appeared before and since, probably none are so gracefully written and engaging. Even the pious will enjoy it. As for the ""admittedly damned"" (HLM's phrase), they will enjoy it all the more."
4,Surprising how little has changed,"It is surprising how little has changed between the pub date of 2005 and this review in 2011.I especially liked the handbook format, including the two-tone illustrations, and the occasional whimsical aside. (When going through psychological screening, for example, the authors suggest potential space tourists avoid ""uncontrollable sobbing."")Some of the bite-sized topics included herein: astrodynamics, handy phonetic Russian phrases, pre-launch quarantine, and space lunch.At the current remaindered price, this book is a great addition to my growing collection of essentially vaporous ""factual"" books on space tourism."
3,Off Side,"My 5 yr old received this as a present 2 weeks ago from his grandparents. He's addicted to the game, unfortunately, the game isn't addicted to him or the other players in the family.In a matter of days, the rods controlling the right wingers either broke or struggled to turn smoothly, same with a couple other players. Of the 12 players on the ice only 7 or 8 work properly, despite the fact that we put the toy away every evening, don't slam it or abuse it."
3,Great toy but fragile,"We bought 3 of these as gifts for a few 5 yr. old boys. They loved it but be warned - these break very easily. The hockey players will break the piece that attaches them to the stick. The kids loved them though and for the 5 yr. olds, they don't even realize that a player on someone's team is missing."
2,"He's already dead,","I can't really say much for this book. It rehashed and reused monsters from previous games; having a head doctor in the story should have created far more interesting monsters. It seemed like the story started out with nothing more then an idea, and the writed decided to just see where the story led him. Stories should always be on a leash, guided and molded into what they are. otherwise you get this story. The only person EVER to have gotten away with letting the story walk itself is the creator of Bob and George of www.bobadgeorge.com .The art (both styles) are unaatractive, yet somehow fit. I liked the idea of having the riddles on the wall, and I felt like taking notes. But I didn't; the story was more like what a non-Silent Hill player viewed Silent Hill as.Nothing to see here, move along, move along."
2,Dying Inside? I Know I Was,"As a fan of the Silent Hill series and its twisted mythos, I was hoping that the comics would expand on that. That the one shot stories with original characters would be worth picking up. While Dying Inside is not as bad as the others, it wasn't that great either.The artwork may have worked if you could actually see what was going on. There were times when the scene was so muddled that I couldn't tell the difference from one of the living human characters or a piece of rancid flesh.The story isn't that strong either. I've seen fanfiction writers do better jobs with the Silent Hill story and create a greater sense of dread in me.Dying Inside does not capture the essence of Silent Hill. That's just my opinion though. I leave it up to others to make their own."
4,Good,The information in this book is so concise. The first two chapters are good for measure and integration theory.
2,Big disappointment,"Well if you collected club 12""s from the 80s & were hoping to finally get a few in digital form, you'll have to look elsewhere. The selection here is not very good. The one track I was hoping to finally get on CD (Air Force One's See the light), which rumor had was actually done by David Byrne (using samples of Ronnie Raygun), however the version included here is actually a dub/instrumental version, with very little of the sample included. To add to that, the tracks here have been transferred from vinyl....come on people, most of us can transfer our vinyl over on our own, at least have a warning on the label."
5,Pure Delight,"I agree with the other reviewer on this one--very few CDs make me feel as good as Stephane Grappelli Plays Jerome Kern. The most remarkable thing about this CD is what Grappelli does with the songs we thought we knew, the ones we'd dismissed long ago--songs like Ol' Man River, Pick Yourself Up, and I Won't Dance. He breathes new life into them, but without ever demanding that you take them seriously, or acknowledge ""the art"" that went into them. His approach serves to remind you that music, when it's done right, can make you feel really really good.So much of what we listen to nowadays is so ponderous, so SERIOUS. But as the Beatles also managed to show us, music can also be a lot of fun. If you want to listen to something that's been crafted to put a smile on your face, this is the one to get."
2,Low quality,"Not well put together, should have spend more money on quality. Started to fall apart at installation. Mesh pockets have ripped apart."
4,A whole new approach to punk rock.,"For those of you who are problaby already tired of the same punk rock cliches, this album comes to the rescue. Pure adrenaline filled rock, with an intensive beat, powerful guitars and interesting melodies. Scandinavia finally got its well deserved spot in the otherwise californian infested world of alternative rock n'roll."
3,Strange one this...,"Here's one of those albums that you get disappointed at first. You play it once, then you switch CD's. Then after a day or two you listen to it again. And you find that some song really aren't that bad. Then the third time you listen to it you find it really ok. And that's what it is. OK. Nothing more, nothing less."
5,What's courage and how do you get it? (Read on!),"What's it like to have painted, written, drawn or created something? You have been, writes Rollo May, ""like God in the Book of Genesis, creating order out of chaos."" Nice work if you can get it - and you can. What it takes is COURAGE - having the fear (of failure, embarrassment or coming up blank) but doing it anyway. This book will help you to conquer that fear. Looking for more inspiration? There's a musical - yes, a musical! - that's all about the ""courage to create."" Check out Stephen Sondheim'sSunday in the Park With George (2006 London Revival Cast)Looking for still MORE inspiration? See:Shake That Brain: How to Create Winning Solutions and Have Fun While You're At It"
3,"I have not read this book, yet, but I like the title","I believe if we are to create we must have courage. We must not be afraid to confront ourselves and our fears. Its easy to be apathetic, its easy to live off other peoples opinions, its hard to find our own, are opinions are our creations. It is hard to let ourselves feel comfortable with just our inside voice, why must we depend on outside voices, what we create is a reflection of what we have lived. Our lives are our creations, do we have enough courage to control it, why am I so vague?"
3,The dark side of Tehran,"The real life of a big city depicted in a way the Iranian censorship did not like too much. In this genre, the real masterpiece remains definitely ""Dayareh"" (The Circle) by Jafar Panahi."
2,"Okay, so actors are overworked and underpaid!","I was greatly disappointed by this book. A wide array of Broadway acting talent offering their ""woe is me"" tales about their difficult lives. The editors have an obvious bias against producers of larger shows and Disney in particular."
3,Be careful of scratches on your laptop,"Bought this some time ago.Unit is robust, combination is easy to use.A 17"" laptop can fit nicely in the case but my largest caveat is that there is nothing to protect the top of the laptop from being scratched from the other items in located in the lid of the case like pens (where are two pen holders there) and even the strap itself.Maybe a really thing laptop would be ok but I would try my best to place something in there to protect the lid.The unit is a little heavy but does a good job protecting everything inside."
5,Much better than the 84C,The 85C was not available anywhere so I bought an 84C initially. Unfortunately it was too small for my laptop and the notebook cooler I have. After several months Amazon had the 85C which is about an inch deeper on their site for sale. About $50 cheaper than the other websites that still didn't have it in stock. I can say it is a good purchase and the locks work just fine.
3,Not helpful when dropped,"Ok, so have had this bag for almost a year. Yea, stuff can come flying out on the inside, and scratch up the top of your MBPro, which is annoying. And it seemed to be nice and protective. As I was slipping the strap on yesterday, it snapped off down by the clasps. The computer landed on a corner. The body of the MBpro has bent. Gonna be hundreds in repair cost for this. Will go with nice soft, surrounded backpack with huge straps from now on."
4,"Great case, looks sharp, a little bulky though","Doesn't quite fit my 17 inch laptop AND the power supply, but still great. Dimensions are about half an inch less than stated, and can be a little awkward to carry, but it still looks very sharp and proffessional."
3,what i needed,I wanted a strong case to hold my notebook computer. This one is strong and tough. It is a tad small for a 15.4 inch laptop and the auxillary wires but will be ok
3,"It's okay, but not their best","This film is so frustrating because it COULD have been MUCH better. It's certainly nowhere near as funny as their Paramount films, but it has its moments. The best scenes in the film are with Margaret Dumont. Other than that, Kenny Baker is annoying and the brothers Marx just look old and tired. Groucho wears a toupee in this film that looks like road kill. MGM ruined every comedian who walked through its doors and this movie is proof of it."
4,A comedic treasure,"This movie is not only great for the Groucho's ever-present one liners or Harpo's physical humor, but even the music in this movie is a treasure. When Groucho sings ""Lydia (That En-Cy-Clo-Pid-ee-ah) it brings the house down and even Chico can help but crack up."
2,Bottom of the Barrel,"This was, in my opinion, the lamest Marx Bros I've seen(haven't seen The Big Store yet). The brothers timing was all off and the material was just lacking. You'd a thought Marx Brothers at the circus HAD to be great but the boys just don't seem into it as if their minds were elsewhere. Lines were not delivered with passion, especially Groucho. Just for reference, my fav's are Cocoanuts, Duck Soup and HorseFeathers. I even got a pretty big kick out of Go West(TIM-BER). I didn't really care for Monkey Business, though."
2,A Marx Bros. Quickie,"This film appears to have been done with little or no rehearsals to fine-tune the comedic timing, and it suffers for it.Glimpses of genius surrounded by pap.Put it on the bottom of the Marx Brothers list."
3,Bad Script Hinders Marx Bro.s' Performances,"The Marx Brothers are greatly burdened by this badly scripted film, which very nearly sinks under the weight of a simpering romantic subplot; still, Groucho, Chico, and Harpo manage to create more laughter than you might expect, particularly when aided and abetted by the amazing Margaret Dumont. Groucho's famous performance of ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady,"" Chico and Harpo's search of the train, and the big top free-for-all at the film's conclusion make AT THE CIRCUS worth the effort."
2,"Well, 2 and a half stars really.","I haven't seen all the Marx Brother's movies, but I think I can speak with confidence that this is their worst. ""At the Circus"" is a weak movie about the Marx Brothers trying to save a circus from going bankrupt.It's such a disappointment to see lame humour and weak jokes coming from the Marx Brothers, but I suppose every star makes a bad movie at some stage.""At the Circus"" does have a few good scenes but even they aren't up to the usual Marx standard. It's worth a look, but don't expect too much."
2,"""At the Circus"" Is Mostly Sawdust","Though it has a few classic moments, notably Groucho's rendition of ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady,"" the lackluster ""At the Circus"" (1939) ranks among the Marxes' worst films. A contributing factor to the depressing atmosphere is the annoying presence of romantic lead Kenny Baker, whose terrible songs and insipid ""Oh, boy!"" cheerfulness have no place in a Marx Brothers film. It's sad to see Groucho, Harpo and Chico brought down by poor material as well as a lack of creative input. Harpo, in particular, is diminished by the MGM gloss. Not even Margaret Dumont's presence can salvage this half-hearted attempt at comedy."
3,2nd rate Marx Bros. is better than no Marx Bros. at all,"Without the guidance and care of Irving Thalberg (who died during production of A DAY AT THE RACES), the quality of the Marx Brothers films started to slide. AT THE CIRCUS is a haphazard attempt to repeat the successful formula of RACES and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. There are still lots of laughs, but they are so loosely strung together that the overall impact is lessened. Also, Kenny Baker's presence really makes one wish for Zeppo, or even Allan Jones.But there is still plenty to enjoy in AT THE CIRCUS. After all, any film that shoots Margaret Dumont out of a cannon and lets Groucho sing a tribute to a tatooed lady can't be all bad!"
4,"Funny,very funny","The title basiclly describes the whole movie. It`s not Duck Soup, or A Day At The Races, but it`s funny anyway. I enjoyed watching this movie very much, mostly for it`s musical numbers, and for it`s once in a while hilarious momensts."
2,"OK if it is a good one, but poor quality control on many of them","The Gilmour Full Flow Poly Connector can be a good product with a large opening which does not restrict the flow of water. This being said, I have purchased a number of these in different configurations. The problem is the mating surface of the male end is not always molded properly leaving an irregular surface which will not seal against the hose washer which is inside the mating female connection. My experience is you have a 1 in 3 chance of having an end which does not properly seal. Disappointing as it could be a decent product if they only focused on quality control."
4,Country Hand Made Candles,"I was always interested in the art of candle making and I find that this book was the best and easiest to understand. Not knowing nothing about the candle making process, I had no trouble at all following the directions and the illustrations were very good. I have since been able to design a few of my own. I highly recommend this book for any beginner to learn."
4,Beautiful but dated,"What a beautiful classic about these marvelous butterflies. The book was purchased for grandchildren in the 6-8 year range although it would be suitable for much younger and older readers too. The visuals are delightful. The clear organization allows the reader to follow the butterfly through its life easily. Also included are guides to raising your own butterflies. Since this beautiful book was published, new research has expanded our understanding, especially of their migrations. The book is too lovely not to check out, just remember to update with a more recent source."
5,Excellent Non-fiction,Great non-fiction book. We use it to teach non-fiction writing using the Lucy Calkins Units of Study and we love it! (and all Gail Gibbons books!)
3,Nothing special,"Jimmy Hart's memoir was interesting to serious wrestling fans, but he played it safe and didn't reveal a whole lot most fans didn't already know. It read like a first-person, book-length website bio. If he would've taken the gloves off it could have been much better."
5,Wonderful,"When I was a young woman, I read this novel at the urging of a lecture from my university. I'm glad I did. For Love Alone is a story that many young woman should be able to relate to. Theresa Hawkins is feisty, strong willed and believes that she loves the cruel and calculating Jonathon Crowe, despite his obvious indifference. It is only through the interference of James Quick, Theresa's employer that she learns of love and her power as a woman.For Love Alone is a wonderful story of a young woman's journey to maturity by the author of ""The Man Who Loved Children""."
3,The Pentagon Paradox,"Interesting but biased. Simply put, Stevenson does not like Hornets. He uses any contradictory or circular argument he can to try to convince the reader that the procurement of the F-18 (he refuses to use F/A-18) was a horrid mistake. Given today's Navy's almost exclusive reliance on the Hornet and its progeny, the Super Hornet, his arguments on its percieved worthlessness, written in the early 90's, come off as laughable. Still if you are obsessed with the Hornet or the inner workings of military procurement, the book is worth reading."
1,There is a case for light fighters. This isn't it.,"The author argues forcibly for the case of lightweight fighters, and tells the story of the development of the F/A-18 and F/A-18E. His work would be far more convincing if it was not extremely rich in factual errors, misrepresentations of the facts, and twisted logic. Read it because it gives the views of some insiders; but don't trust it."
3,Very misleading,Count Basie is only on one number in fact.Ella's regular pianist plays with the CB Orchestra for the rest of the DVD/concert. I would also say that Ella was past her best by this stage. This isn't to say that its terrible. In fact its good most of the time - but not as great as if it had been filmed 10 or 20 years earlier.
4,Nightlight,I bought this as a present for a young child. He liked it but I don't have any information on how it works. I looks exactly like the picture when purchased.
3,it's just okay,I've had this camera just a little over a year and have made it through learning the modes in the rather large instruction manual and the one problem I have is not-so clear pictures! It either get a pixelated photo or it just is slightly out of focus! I thought there was something wrong with my camera alone but I went to: dpreview.com to their gallery and found pictures taken by actual digital cameras by actual people and in 18 pictures listed for this camera ALL of them were blurry/not sharp as well. If you are shopping for a camera go to dpreview first and see what kind of pictures it takes.
4,Good Bridge Digital Camera but a Battery HOG,I got this camera new back in 2003 and it served me faithfully for 5 years before the camera's compact flash reader konked out. I learned how to do better photography with this tool for my Maxxums. This is an intuitive tank of a camera and has an excellent lens that many overlook as it has a constant aperture of f2.8 and a zoom range of 28-200mm. This Achilles heal of this camera is it's mixed blessing of the use of the very common AA battery: and does this thing eat them! I already had a good supply of AA batteries and that an easy issue to deal with. I miss using this camera and took many memorable shots with it before it gave up the ghost. This review is a little late :) but I feel it's due because I really dig this camera and it was the one that got me using digital to help me be better at 35mm film.
2,Damage rather than Dimage and POOR service,"I bought this camera based on positive reviews by other. The camera came defective right from the box -- the memory card cannot be ejected from the camera. I called Minolta twice for this problem. The first time they said they would send me a form to fill up for repair and service. I waited for a week and nothing had happened. I then call again and the operator bluntly told me that they were not going to send me anything. But they would E-mail me a ""request for service"" form. Then I am supposed to find my own way to send the camera to their repair center. If I choose to ship the camera to repair center, they explicitly disclaim any cost nor any liability from shipping and handling.I am very frustuated that Minolta would take such an indifferent approach to their defective products. I find their attitude and product warranty policy totally unacceptable."
3,Cons,"You won't be disappointed by the quality photos the 7Hi will take. If you're still considering buying this camera, consider other options as there are newer models. Considering there are dozens of reviews on the product itself, here are the weaknesses that I've experienced:- Drains batteries. The 7Hi uses 4 AA batteries. If you're going on a trip, plan on bringing 4-8 extra rechargable batteries (at least 1800 mAH) and a battery charger. One set of batteries should last at least 100 shots (without flash). Do not use regular alkaline batteries as the camera will go through them quickly (Maybe 50 shots).- Does not utilize highspeed CF cards. I purchased a Lexar 512MB 40x CF Card, and did notice any increase in performance over the one included.- Many digital cameras now have video capabilities. The 7Hi records videos in quicktime .mov format at a maximum length of 60 seconds. The videos come out grainy."
1,Batteries will not hold a charge,"I love the features of the camera. However, after carefully following instructions about battery charging 4 times so that they would hold a charge, I have recharged them 6 times and they will not hold a charge. Even when they are fresh, they will not power the camera. It's going back to the store tomorrow for a refund. I am not interested in getting a brand new camera fixed. It is one week old and is obviously defective."
1,A Plot-theorist attacking scriptures.,"Salibi is no stranger to controversy and has now come up with an elegant way for attacking Jesus and the Bible. What is odd is that the author claims no particular expertise in Greek or Aramaic but still wish to tackle linguistic issues related to the scriptures!He seems to have a particular problem with St-Paul and his journey to Arabia. Further the church stands accused of destroying the ""real Gospel."" All that without proof or evidence and a mediocre linguitic skill in semitic languages.A plot theory par exellence.The book was a waste of time and money. Thumb down. Way down."
5,Soul Music,"I really enjoy Ayub Ogada's music. It is the fact that so much joyful sound comes from one man that most entices me. I first experienced Mr. Ogada at the WOMAD Festival in Redmond, Washington, and have been a disciple since. I believe he has tapped deeply into the root of life. I hope you enjoy his works as much as I do."
5,Habit forming!!,"Wow! This c.d. is great! It has something for everyone. ""There is a longing"" is a hauntingly beautiful slow song. ""Alle, Alle, Alleluia"" has an upbeat Jamaican style that makes you want to sing along. It also has traditional classics such as ""Celtic Alleluia"" and ""You Are Near"" that brought tears to my eyes. Every song on this c.d. is amazing. The sisters voices blend so well together and many songs have solos. Whatever mood you are in, there is a song for you on this c.d. These sisters are defintely habit forming!!"
3,This CD is ok,"The sound is not as good as it could be on this particular CD from this group. I believe it is an earlier recording than the better one, Celebrate. However, I love the fact they are sisters who auditioned for this choir and I do enjoy this recording as well."
3,Duke it ain't. Lord have Mercer!,"I have actually had this CD for almost 20 years, and occasionally I would give it a spin, but frankly there is something about the sound of this music, the way that it is recorded, that grates and irritates, so although it has many of Duke Ellington's best numbers on it, something is definitely missing. Then recently I got the album Masterpieces by Ellington, which you can also get here, which is the real Duke in hi-fi from the 50's, and the difference is stunning. If you listen to both albums and still prefer this one, then so be it, but it is like night and day."
2,Not the Greatest...,"To clear any confusion, this is NOT a digitally remastered collection of original Duke Ellington analogs. Rather, it is Mercer Ellinton conducting the new Duke Ellington Orchestra, with new musicians and arrangements. It lacks the feel/atmosphere of the original Duke Ellington recordings from the 30's-50's, not to mention that some songs are just BLAND. I can't stand the Branford Marsalis version of ""Take the 'A' Train"" on this album (what used to be a swingin', roarin' Train is now a schlumpy, elevator-muzak Train). Not a bad album if you don't mind them slapping Duke's name on something that's NOT DUKE!!"
1,Not happy with Amazon customer service,"I am not happy with the way Amazon took care of my complaint. First of all I would like a phone number to talk to someone direct and not by email. I received this item and assembled it and when I went to test it I noticed one of the gas control knobs was broke. I emailed Amazon right away and told them I only need the knob for the unit, but the first thing they did was to send me out another unit with freight charges and told me to send the other unit back which would cost me another $10.to ship it UPS. I called the company that made the unit and they said they would send me a part out at no charge asap. Come on Amazon listen before you take the easy was out.Not happy."
4,Review !,Item as promised. Assembly was easy and packaging quite secure. Delivery was veryfast. I plan to send one to my son to use as a fish fryer.
4,"Works great, but read the small print!","This is a great, simple stove. Make sure you read the small print - the regulator and hose is not included!"
1,Poor Quality,"Legs can not be tightened so it won't wobble. Not stable. Can not control the burners to a low setting, it's either high or they go out! Will probably give it away and buy a better product."
1,Garbage...,"Purchased identical item locally from a large outdoor Hunting/Fishing/Camping chain. First one had a bad valve, so I exchanged it. Second one had 2 broken legs, so I exchanged that. Third one lasted one camping trip before a crack started to show in the frame...threw it away once I got home. But something steel, not this Chinese cast iron crap metal..."
3,usable but not great,"Some holes are mis-aligned, so expect some difficulties when you assemble it. I wish they are provide some adapters/connectors for easy hook up."
5,Out of This World,"Unfortunately, the asking price for this CD is ""Out of this world"" as well. I'm glad I already have it.The cool-toned guitarist Ed Bickert sounds in fine form on this quartet set with fellow Canadians Rick Wilkins on tenor, bassist Steve Wallace and drummer Terry Clarke. Sticking mostly to swing standards (plus Jimmy Heath's ""C.T.A.,"" a Milt Jackson blues and ""Somewhere Along the Way""), Bickert varies the tempos while always sounding relaxed and lightly swinging; Rick Wilkins gets in some good spots too."
4,A light popcorn movie with little delights throughout,"This is a well-written and well-acted light comedy that goes back and forth between London and Paris, where the two protagonists (real-life husband and wife Yvan and Charlotte) are dealing with jealousy, art and the way life swings too quickly between the light and the heavy. Lots of fun little subplots, and beautifully lit and competently directed. If you're trying to learn French as I am, you'll also appreciate the dialogue -- quick, casual, real."
3,i love Charlotte Gainsbourg,"This movie is somewhat enjoyable, but nothing great. However, Charlotte Gainsbourg is uniquely beautiful and capitivating, and steals the movie and my heart. Worth seeing, just for her."
5,delightful - an escape from Hollywood,"I really enjoyed this film. The story itself was nothing extraordinary, but it embodied the lovely sensitivity of French cinema. I liked it because it gave me a glance of French or European film industry that was so different from the glittery Hollywood. The actress in the film was portrayed as a real, sensible and normal person. I also realized after watching the film that the main characters were a real life couple and the husband was the director, which added another interesting layer to it. They did not even change their names in the film! I really liked the human qualities of this kind of production in comparison to the manufactured qualities of many commercial films. I felt that it was a collaboration of a group of young people whom were working with a modest budget. However, they have done a great job with the limited resources because they had something to say and they knew how to say it well. It was really about making art than making a product."
3,Not totally bad,Cool shirt. The only setback is the fact that the image is not centered when you put it on.
5,The Best,"I brought this shirt as a gift for my husband and when he receieved it, he was amazed because Bruce Lee is his all time favorite. He loves the shirt so much.Thanks."
4,Very good practice bases for backyard use,"If you're serious about baseball practice, you need to have some bases for various drills.This product fills the void between the cheap, flimsy bases that don't stay in place & the more expensive, realistic bases that have to be staked into the ground. These are heavy enough to more-or-less stay in place (i.e. even when trod upon) but easy to pick up out of the way when it's time to mow the yard.Since these only cost $10 more than the flimsy bases, they are a no-brainer choice. You can buy a similarly made 'home plate' base on Amazon, too."
1,Dont buy this!,I wonder how this group manages to call their music vallenato... it would never match the beatiful songs as the ones original from the north coast of Colombia. It is a pity to let them use such a nice genre for the sake of selling low-class and poor quality music.
2,Meh,"The design was straight-forward. I had to cut a big hole in my backdoor and sandwich the penetration with the plastic frame. It actually installed pretty easily.Flash forward 5 years: The flap has been replaced twice. The in/out traffic eventually tears away the plastic from the frame. It's easy to replace, but irritating. Also the insert that is used to seal off the door (for when you don't want your pup to leave the house) is mangled to shreds. It is cardboard so if you use it regularly, the corners start to fray and in-climate weather will warp the face.Not good for a long-term solution."
1,A Brick is Brick and Red is Red.,I was a little unhappy when the towels arrived. Brick is more maroon. Also they are not as soft as EGYPTIAN cotton from retail stores. Sorry Amazon.
5,towels,"I love the towels, they are soft and wonderful. However they shed quite a bit, so much so that my boyfriend will not use them. But whatever, I bought them for me anyway!Would I recommend them, yes I def would because for the price I paid, the extra cloth should surely wash away.ShannaNew York, NY"
3,Good Value,I wish there was a way to know in advance where things are made. I was expecting Portugal which makes truly wonderful products but these were made in Pakistan. They are very good for the price and the wash cloths are almost like finger tip towels (very large). The taupe color that I purchased was not consistently the same throughout all pieces so I would not recommend that color. Again very good for the price but I always prefer Portugal!
2,Nothing special,"I bought these towels on a good sale, mistakenly thinking that they were actually worth the posted normal price. They are average quality at best. I have two sets of much higher quality towels that I purchased at my local Target. These towels are soft, but relatively thin and have already started to discolor."
1,Towel rip off,"DO NOT BUY THESE TOWELS. I read some of the negative reviews but still trusted Amazon naive, huh?) and ordered them. They are about as thick as a Kleenex, some of them had fabric faults, and even considering the cheap price, they aint worth even sending back (if I could). This obvious peddling of poor quality and ""seconds"" merchandise may color my attitude towards buying anything more from Amazon, especially from its own departments."
1,"pretty to look at, horrible to use","These towels look great, feel nice and soft. Unfortunately, when you use them after a shower it is like drying off with a plastic sheet. They do not absorb anything; they just smear the water around and eventually you dry off by evaporation. In fact, instead of making me feel dry and comfortable, I feel cold as the water is moved around on my skin. My suggestion: use them as guest towels for guests you want to leave."
1,Paper towels are a better option,"Don't waste your money/time on these junk towels ... linty, fade when washed, unravel at the edges, smell bad when opened, feel cheap ... Amazon should be embarrassed to peddle these. Getting towels from Goodwill might be better. Actually, these aren't totally useless ... you could ""encourage"" overstaying house guests to leave by putting these junk towels in the bathroom for them to use OR they could be a cheap alternative to dermabrasion!"
2,non-absorbant,the colors are perfect and the towels are soft but... they are the last thing that will dry you off after a shower. zero absorbancy! they seem to have improved a bit after 6 washes.
1,Poor quality!,"I bought two sets of these towels to use for guests. Towels were thin, edges frayed in the wash and they don't absorb like they should. Washed several times and they have continued to shed lint. Would not recommend these towels to anyone. Good price, fast shipping but not a good product."
3,OK,"For the price I paid (around $15) the towels are adequate enough. They're not as plush as I was hoping for from the pictures, but they feel decent enough for the price."
1,Not worth it,"I haven't used these yet, just washed them yesterday. EVERY single item in the set has fraying around the edges, some of it really bad (the complete edging coming off). I've had better luck with towels from Walmart. NEVER have I had any towels fall apart on the first wash before like these. I can only imagine what subsequent washings will do. In fact, I haven't even seen this from old towel sets I've had for many years. Very poor quality!!"
1,Zero Stars - Absolute Junk,"These are by far the worst towels I have ever purchased!!! After the first wash, on a gentle cycle I might add, the towels are completely frayed around the edges. It took 10 minutes just to clean up the lose threads from the washing machine, and no I did not overload the machine. These are absolute trash and I would not recommend them even as rags. Completely regret this purchase."
2,Pike Street Towel Set,"I am not a picky person but I can not recommend these towels. The color is not as pictured but that did not matter very much to me. They are absorbent, not the greatest but good enough. However, after using and washing them for just couple of months, the edges are coming apart on every single one of the towels.I have towels that are years old that look better then these, these will soon go for the dog. I know they are not expensive, but the quality of workmanship is just not good. I will not buy them again."
3,OK towels,"I read the reviews on amazon for these towels and felt comfortable enough to order. This towels are o.k., but they are not very luxurious. They have many strings hanging from them, and just seem blah."
1,Don't buy these towels,"I strongly urge people not to buy these towels! They are very plush, but almost right after I bought them they started to fray along the edges. I have had to re-stitch the two large bath ones several times. It's as if they didn't allow enough fabric tucked underneath the topstitching. The ones I bought from Walmart (Pike Street didn't have the complementary color for my bathroom that I wanted), while not nearly as plush, have held up fine, even two years later. And ""Egyptian cotton,"" while it sounds so luxurious, doesn't seem to be as absorbent when you get out of the shower."
1,Worst towels in HISTORY!! x 4,"I purchased this towel set (in four different colors) because it was a great sale/offer and i thought to myself how bad can towels actually be??!Well lets just say politely they can get REALLY bad!! Prior to this purchase i have had a lemon here and there throughout my life time but nothing can compare to this set!!!!!!These towels do not suck in even a drip of water they just rubbed it around while fuzz gets stuck on your skin.............Needless to say that is one of the worst and most disgusting feelings you can ever get from any towel!This set and a microfiber set i have bought from Jcpenney is really the worst towels i have ever bought and owned. I would not even use them to clean my house!!I would NEVER recommend these or ever buy them again!!PS: You can only review an item once even if you have bought it in multiple colors, etc. So this review is 4 different sets in 4 different colors!"
1,Very poor quality,The stitched edging of the four towels came apart in the first washing. The towels are now frayed on the edges and look terrible. I would advise anyone thinking about purchasing these towels to buy from a different manufacturer.
2,VERY CHEAP LOOKING,It was a mistake to order these towels. They are of very low quality and cheap lookig as well. Don't buy it!!
5,good towels and good price,recieved on time and towels looked great. Washed them separately since I got the red ones and they came out soft and fluffy.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Nothing is a ""deal"" these days. If you follow this motto in life, you will NEVER be disappointed- ""You Get What You Pay For."" Period. Come on, Egyptian cotton towels, an entire set for $19.99 ? You Get What You Pay For... They look & feel nice-- possibly for a few months, then they turn into $19.99 towels--for the entire set. Get it? Enough said. Good Luck."
5,Great Buy,I love the color and feel of the Terracotta egyptian cotton towels. I will never buy anything buy egyptian cotton towels again.
2,nice but fell apart,"hi, i love the soft feel, only one held up other 3 fezzled on edges,still use them, wish edges held up..bummer"
2,DON'T BOTHER!,"I purchased these towels that looked great when I opened the package. I washed them before I used them and now they look like I have had them for 10 years. The edges came apart, they faded and lost so much bulk they weren't even the same towels anymore. My old ones looked better."
1,Not what I thought I was getting,After one wash they were falling apart. Also not very soft as you would expect based on how they were advertised.
2,"You get what you pay for........no more, maybe less.","You get what you pay for........no more, maybe less.I was hopeful when I placed my order, they had gotten some good reviews. Then I received them and all hope was lost. These are seconds with loose threads, miss stitching and defects in the weave. I would expect to find this quality at Big Lots (but for a lower price). After washing a noticeable defect in the weave about 5"" long showed up on one of the bath towels. For $ 20.00 not worth the headache of returning them. I will use then for washing the car and the dog. They can not be on towel racks in the bathroom where guest would see them. The Bluestone color is more a periwinkle blue with purple under tones.Buyer be ware."
2,Who set the ridiculous regular price of $130?,I bought a set in cocoa color. I just washed them second time by hand and they are still discharging their die. They are huge but they shrink when you tumble dry them to a better size. And I have used scissors several times to trim loose threads around the hems-poor workmanship. And one wash towel has a visible tear right in the middle. And that horrible white tags!They are thirsty towels though.I am keeping them for the price I paid which was around 20 dollars.
4,Egyptian Cotton Towels,I found these towels to be soft and wash very nicely. I have been very pleased!Drying capacity could be better but it's not bad. Color was what I had hoped. Very good price for the product.
4,Love these towels!,"I used my towels for the first time today and I LOVE THEM! I highly reccomend them, and for the price; you cannot bet this deal!"
3,just bought these new towels,"Okay, I used a set of these towels at a relative's house - they were great. So, I ordered some - just got them yesterday and they are the flattest towels I've ever seen. Wondering if they'll ""puff up"" when I wash them or if I should just send them back..."
5,Super deal,"This towels are super-sized as well as super soft and absorbent. Definitely worth it, especially with this great sale price. The towels frayed slightly after the initial washing, but I cleaned them up with a pair of scissors and they look great. There isn't a better feeling than stepping out of the shower and into one of these towels-they dry me off and warm me up instantly. (They're so nice and luxurious that my boyfriend is afraid to use them and make them dirty haha)"
2,"Look nice, work poorly","The towels look nice and are good and heavy. Unfortunately, they are not absorbent. When toweling off after a shower you still end up wet (and cold). I went back to using my old towels."
2,Poor quality,"Towels are not very absorbant. They also have alot of lint. I washed them once before using and they left lint on my skin. After 3-4 washings and a filled lint filter each time, they were a little better but now thinner. The Walmart Egyptian towels are more expensive but a much better product."
3,disappointed,I washed the towel set immediately upon receipt. The towels were still nice and fluffy but there were a lot of loose threads at the edges. This leaves me with the impression they are not well made. I wonder how well they will hold up with multiple washings.
2,Disappointed,"I love new towels, and was surprisingly disappointed in your offer of 100% Egyptian Cotton towel set. One bath towel was ripped on the edge and the colors were different. One set looked faded.Thank you for letting me explain. It looked like such a good deal.Sue Porter"
5,Towel set,"I was very pleased with my purchase. The price was great and the towels nice, soft, and the bath towel large."
2,color off,The color was not the same as in the picture. It was gray instead of lavender. I have returned it.
5,Egyptian Cotton Towels,The quality of these towels is excellent. They are large and plush. I got a bargain deal on it.
4,Pike Towels,"I bought these ""Egyptian Cotton 725-Gram 6-Piece Towel Sets"" in Feb. on a Friday sale for under $20.00. I was sssurprised the quality had gone down from the three sets of this same set from four years ago. 1.) These are not as thick as before and 2.) they do not have the nice color saturation.I bought Taupe and Cocoa. The taupe has a very deep Olive Green undertone, renerdering them more a Sage color. The Cocoa is more a deep Coffee bean brown, which I like.For the price under twenty they are good and I would purchase agian, but with caution on color and thickness."
5,The best towels,"We LOVE these towels! They get better with every wash. They are soft, absorbant and very thick. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointed this time around,"I had previously purchased what I thought were the same towels in the wedgewood color but from a different listingPike Street 100-Percent Egyptian Cotton 725-Gram 6-Piece Towel Set, Wedgewood. You may notice that the wedgewood listing has a bit higher price but everything else looks the same. Well, I liked my wedgewood towels, they were a nice color and held up pretty well. THEN I decided to order a second set in Taupe (this listing) when I saw them on black Friday sale. I'm pretty disappointed with this set. First time through the wash (I have a front loading top of the line washer/dryer) a few of the towels came out with the sides totally frayed off. Although they look and feel pretty much the same as the towels from the other listing, they seemed to not be made as well. Very disappointing, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Not a good buy,"As others have said, these towels do not absorb moisture, so you can't really use them to dry...anything. And one of the hand towels completely fell apart in the wash - the night they were delivered. I would not recommend these towels."
1,"Shredded after one wash, gentle cycle, on cold","I read a number of the reviews indicating these towels were phenomenal - fluffy, absorbent, great color. Unfortunately the company must have changed something in the manufacturing process because I purchased two sets of these towels and washed them in cold water on the gentle cycle and dried on low to get any lint out and the edges are coming undone. There is thread hanging off all but one of the six piece set. In addition, after two washes they still leave lint all over me after drying and tend to just push the water around. Save your money and buy a nice Ralph Lauren towel on sale at Macy's - they are only $10, last forever, retain their color, and dry wonderfully. Very disappointed in this purchase but that's what I get for only spending $20 on six towels I guess."
2,Falling Apart At The Seams,After one washing some of the towels came apart at the seams with threadshanging from the edges. In one month a few of them went from the towelcabinet to the rag bag.
1,Sandi's worst ever buy 6 piece towel set,"These are the worst towels I have ever purchased. After one wash they are comming apart. Do not buy no matter what unless you need dog towels, or mop rags.They are truly horable. I boutht three sets one green, one blue and one taupe."
1,Rather Average Bath Towels,"These are rather average towels and certainly not as advertised. They are okay for everyday use but they are neither very absorbent nor all that soft. To me they are your average, run of the mill bath towel s. They also came with on towel slightly faded already and have already lost color after a few washes. The only positive are they are large and do the basic job they are designed for, drying off after a shower or bath."
2,If you don't plan on washing them....,"they will be great towels for you. I was impressed with the towels when I received them and after using them but after washing them twice they are falling apart. The towels are big, thick and absorbent but they are not well made. Not even worth the $19.99 I paid for them. I will pay more attention to reviews next time."
2,pretty disappointed after first wash,"I read all the reviews about shreds, figured, oh, it's a cheap price, maybe it'll work out, right? Wrong. I washed these immediately upon receipt, and in the first wash, one hand towel is already shredding. A couple of other towels have a thread here and there coming off, but maybe those will be ok? The shredded one, obviously won't. I am still optimistic that the remaining towels of the set will be ok, but the other reviews on here tell me that I should not get my hopes up. Well, meanwhile they are the softest towels that I own. I bought the brick towels, if that matters to anyone.UPDATE 5/23/2012: All of the towels have pretty much shredded. I want to like the towels but when you have it falling apart and snagging on you as you use them, it makes them unusuable."
2,You get what you pay for,For under $20 that's what these are worth. NO bargain here. I always wash linens and clothes before I use them. There was more of the towel left in the lint filter than there was on the towel. I don't expect these to last long. They should have stayed in China.
1,Terrible towels - wish I hadn't bought them,"Why would anyone make a towel that does not absorb water?????? These towels feel cold when you dry off and do not absorb water. I have read the reviews and did not do anything incorrect in washing them! They just don't hold water. They also shred! Glad I got the cheaper rate, but I wouldn't get these again EVEN if they paid me to take them - well maybe, but to use them as rags!"
3,just ok,these towels were slightly on the rough side with the color/material getting on wet skin. Not as good as I thought they'd be...but I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Not that great,"After the first wash these towels were ""threading"" and a bunch of its fluff stuck to the towels. I thought maybe if I washed it again it will get rid of the fluff, but not so. There are also loose threads hanging on the towels. I bought the sea blue set and its not as great as the picure looks. Granted, I only paid $23 for the set, but in the future I'd spend a little more and get better towels."
4,Nice quality,"I got these last year. Got white 4 for 3 deal. They are a very solid 4 stars so far. Very little lint, big size and soft/sturdy. Look very nice and feel nice as well. They will not last 10 years, but I don't need them to."
5,Fantastic for the price,"These are very nice, heavy and soft towels (set). The colors are lovely and true. I got them on a Friday sale with 4 for price of 3, so I think it may have been the best deal on the planet for the moment!"
2,Not that great :(,"I put these straight in the washer, with no softener. They came out with 6 inch long threads all over them. That alone wasn't enough to return them, but the fact they are just an average feeling weight and texture was. I looked at all of the reviews and decided to give them a chance.They're going back."
1,Already shredding,"The towels feel fine, they are soft to the touch. The problem is the edging on one bath towel already started shredding the first time I washed them. Second time they were washed more towels started to shred and of course the first got worse. The edges get very ragged looking after a while.I was very unhappy about what I consider a large defect in a new product after seeing a lot of 4-5 ratings. Funnily enough after re-reading some of those people mentioned this defect.If you don't care about the shredded side edging and are looking for something cheap, absorbent and soft go ahead and buy these for cheap towels. Personally, I think I could have done better going to Kohl's on sale, Marshall's or TJ Maxx for the price."
2,bath towels,i know these weren't a lot of money but enough that i thought they wouldn't pill up after one washing.......not a great product.
3,Towels were smelly,"Ordered these towels hoping they would be soft and absorbent. They were not and they had a horrible smell. After two washings the smell gone, but they are not soft."
1,Does not absorb water,"Do not waste your money - These towels do not absorb water which leaves you feeling cold and wet. Taupe color is not attractive either as it looks like the color of mud. Yes, they are soft and fluffy. Don't Buy!"
1,don't buy these towels,These towels were awful. The first time I washed these towels they shredded at the edges. The few towels that didn't shred barely absorbed any water when trying to dry off. Don't buy these towels.
2,Worst Towels Ever,"I am not sure about previous reviews... I have been using these towels since July (it is October) very lightly. First day I got it there was red stuff falling off throughout my room, and I didn't mind it because it was new so then I had washed it a few times and now its falling apart. Threads are coming off, covered my room in red thread balls, turned my other towels red, when I use this in the shower I come out covered red.Please look for better towels even it is $5-10 more expensive. I gave it 2 stars because it's cheap and you get a lot of junk.Thanks"
1,Terrible Towels,"The first set of towels that Amazon sent completely shredded on the edges during the FIRST washing! I wrote an email and Amazon replaced the set. Well maybe I got a bad set the first time, I thought, give them another try. The second set didn't start shredding until the SECOND washing. I actually felt guilty about returning the second set and thought maybe I would just use them for the dog, but in addition to shredded edges, they are not absorbant! So these are going back too. Maybe this brand used to be good, but my experience with two sets (taupe) was terrible. And really, even though the price was good, these towels are so bad that they are not worth it. You could get much better towels at Target for the same price."
2,Soft but not absorbant,"My wife and I really like Egyptian cotton towels. We were excited by Amazon's sale and took a chance. These towels are very soft. A huge plus! Unfortunately they lack absorbency qualities. The towel feels cold as we dry off and the water does not feel like it is being absorbed. Wet and cold is not a good feeling in the morning! We do not use dryer sheets or any type of detergent product that would coat the towels. As for pricing, we did NOT get a super saver discount as promised in Amazon's advertising but were attracted to the initial sale price. All in all, we will not buy this towel again."
2,Lost color immediately!,"These are beautiful, soft towels at a great price. Unfortunately, they lost color in splotches immediately after being used a few times. I washed the towels in warm water with Cheer detergent, and the pale green color had a tinge of orange in places. I have never had this problem with other towels. I was planning to use these as special towels for the guest bathroom, but now they will ""hide"" in our bathroom, since they are still wonderfully absorbent and nice to touch, but they look awful. I was quite disappointed, but at least they were cheap!"
2,Soft but not absorbant,"These towels are beautiful and feel extremely soft as described. The problem is that they aren't very absorbant. They just don't dry my body like other towels do. I thought maybe that would change after a few washings, but no such luck. Theyv'e been through six washings now and still no improvement.I'm disappointed. I bought four sets but now I find myself reaching for old towels from the back of the linen closet.Also, be careful washing them. The colors will definitely run in the first two or three washings. Don't wash with other towels (as I did). The old towels will come out the color of your new ones."
1,High hopes but disappointed,"I bought the blue color of these towels for our guest bathroom. They would not be used regularly and I thought that I had gotten a great deal. After the first washing, as per the washing instructions, the edges were shredded. I also noticed that there are orange and white splotches on the towels and now attempt to creatively hide all the damage. These are not very soft either, so don't be fooled by the description. I love Amazon but regret this purchase."
2,EH...,"They're ok. I can't say I was impressed. The price, of course, was great, but these towels certainly are not worth the quoted regular price of $130. They had a lot of loose threads and are not particularly absorbant. They feel nice, but you can buy better quality towels at any housewares store that do not cost $130 for a set. I would say they are probably worth their sale price, clearly it is worth it for a 6 towel set, but they are a fairly low quality towel, so don't think you are getting a great deal. I would suggest going to a discount housewares store and finding something there if you are looking for a deal."
4,Egyptian Cotton Towels,My husband and I truly enjoy these towels. They are so thick and absorb water better than any towel we've ever used. The material is soft yet thick. I wish all of my towels felt as good. I guess I'll have to order more.
5,Lush,"I'm amazed. I didn't expect anything as nice as these towels. I thought, for that price, there has to be something wrong. They are very large and very nice."
2,It's a good thing these were such a deal...,"or they would have been returned. Not the thick, absorbant towels I was hoping for. An odd color, too. My husband claims they are a moss green, and I say they are a mauve/tan. Oh well. What can I expect for twenty bucks?!?"
3,towels,I had ordered a set of Pike Street 100-percent Egyptian cotton 6 piece towel set in chocolate and like them so much that I ordered a second set in taupe. I plan to order more for Christmas presents.
3,"Iffy quality, but still a good deal","I've only been using these for a couple weeks. The first time I washed them a lot of the color bled, so what was chocolate brown is now chocolate with orangey mottling. Still, if they hold up beyond that I'll consider them an excellent deal. They feel nice enough, and the price is hard to argue with."
2,totally not worth it,"I got these because they were a great price and although some reviews said the towels weren't absorbent, I decided to take a chance. Bad mistake, I might as well not be using them when i get out of the shower. As a girl, I need a good absorbent towel to dry my hair and these continue to fail every time. I've washed them a couple times hoping to ""break them in"" but to no avail. I am now on the look out for new towels and have learned my lesson; don't risk a towel not being able to perform it's most basic function. Just pass these ones by"
3,"A little thinner than I thought, but good for the price","I gave these as gifts and thought they would be thicker than they were, but still happy for the price. I don't know how they hold up with multiple washings since I didn't keep a set for myself."
2,Don't Buy These Towels!,"These look and feel great, but DO NOT ABSORB water! One reviewer said after several washes they become more absorbant and I hope that is true, but I would not order these again."
5,VERY SOFT YET VERY USABLE TOWELS,"I'm a guy, so when it comes to writing a review on something, especially for towels...well, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't write reviews. I felt strongly enough about the quality of these towels to write a review. My wife purchased them and we've been using them ever since we received them. Very big and soft towels that are also very usable and now we're looking to buy another set for our other bathroom..."
3,Costly Egyptian Cotton Towels,"These towels originally cost over $100.00 and for the life of me, I can't figure out why! They are okay as towels go, but they are not nearly as soft and plush as I thought they would be so all in all, I like my Canon towels much better."
1,Is Zero Stars Available?!,My wife & I just bought these towels and received them quickly from Amazon. That's the end of the good news right there. We immediately washed them. When we went to put them in the dryer we noticed all the edges had frayed and the stitching had come undone... in ONE wash! My current towels from Macys have been washed dozens of times with no damage to the towels.These are the biggest joke of towels I've ever purchased and will be returning IMMEDIATLEY. DO NOT BUY THESE TOWELS.
3,"good quality, soft, pretty good thread","Overall, I am happy with these towels. They are very soft and absorbent, and I although I have washed them many times now, I have not had any problems with them loosing color. I like the pale green color - it is fairly neutral - more of on the mint side of a sage color. Recently, however, I have noticed that the stitching on the ends of a couple towels are coming a little undone. I have been able to trim that ok so it looks fine, but it was a little disappointing. The weave itself is holding up great - no loops pulling out. At the moment I'll recommend these towels, and will repost if that stitching issue turns out to be a bigger problem than I thought. Because of the stitching I was a little hesitant to give these a ""4 star"", but they are probably close."
1,Worst towels ever purchased,These towels when first used are like using wax paper. There is absolutely no absorption and they just move the water around on your body. After 7 or 8 washings trying to get them to perform better they are no more absorpant and they are unraveling around the edges and they are still bleeding in the washing machine.
1,Had the same problem with color loss,no problem with absorbency however i did notice the splotching after several uses. I have never had a towel do this and will probably not purchase another product from this vendor.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Order arrived as indicated. Washed and dried the towel set to get rid of the plastic wrapping smell. Towel set completely fell apart in the washer/dryer! Oh well, they'll make fair car washing rags."
1,VERY THIN - POOR QUALITY - TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I guess I did not pay enough attention to the detail. I searched for Martex towels and these came up. I thought I was buying Martex, not these cheap Pike Street towels. I guess when you are buying from Amazon you have to really pay attention. I feel like it was a bait and switch trick!"
5,A BEAUTIFUL SET OF TOWELS,THIS SET OF TOWELS ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL AND I WOULD ADVISE ALL TO BUY THEM ASAP AS AT THIS PRICE THEY ARE A GREAT DEAL FOR LUXERY.
2,Soft but sheds like crazy!,The towels are really soft and absorbent but they shed like crazy. I've only washed them once so I'll just have to see how they hold up after a few more washes.
2,"Soft, but lots of loose threads","When I received these, they were pretty nice, and they are soft, but about half had threads missing and they all had several loose threads around the sides that needed to be cut, so they will begin fall apart after a few washings. Fine for me, but my girlfriend will complain."
1,the good news is: Amazon makes returns easy!,"The bad news is: this product is absolute junk. When these came up on a Gold Box deal last month, I read all the reviews and decided that since I wanted to buy white towels, it didn't matter about the fading colors and funky dye smells. The towels arrived and looked nice...I washed them before use, of course, and one of the bath towels fell apart! Warm wash, normal cycle...and the hem came completely unravelled, and a long ""run"" showed up down the middle of the towel. That was enough for me, and of course Amazon refunded my money when they received the towels back."
3,Good Towels,"In my imaginings, these towels were fluffier and more luxurious. Truth be told, i don know the first thing about picking towels. These are better than my old towels. They are not thin. Naturally, it took a couple washings to make them stop shedding. But, still, they do not absorb enough water off my hairy husband. Just telling it like it is. They are good for the price - but I no longer feel that I got an awesome bargain, since they are not awesome, but good enough."
2,Very luxurious towels but they are not absorbent.,"We have had these towels for almost a year and a half now and they still look great!The color, Heather, wasn't the same as it was pictured but we kept them anyway as they felt great.They feel great and as I mentioned they have held up great to daily use but we are still disappointed in them.The towels just do not absorb water like they should.When you start to dry off the towels feels cold to the touch and that is the reason for only 2 stars.I have read where people say that you can not use fabric softners on them or they will not be absorbent.We have never used fabric softeners on them in either the washer or dryer so that is not the problem."
3,Good deal- but not ultra soft,"The reviews posted on Amazon are typically quite solid.I think that the towels are nice and a great price. However, the reviews that mention that they are extremely soft- influenced me to buy them- but they were wrong. They are averagely soft but not not overly so. Again, a good price for what you get."
1,no absorbency,The product sounded good but they do not absorb at all. I wish I never got them. A waste of money.
5,Worth The Price,"I read through all the reviews before making my purchase and decided to go ahead and take the plunge. Are they worth $130? Of course not. Are they worth $25? Yes, absolutely. What other customers say about the smell is true, they do smell when you first unwrap them from their packaging.I bought both the pale green and terracotta colors and found them both very soft, absorbant and hefty. They did not lose color when washed and the smell went away after the first washing. I noticed no loss of color. There were a few very minor threads on the green set. None noted on the terracotta.I would absolutely recommend these towels. Very nice product at a very good price."
4,"excellent quality, great price","It's hard to get towels at this price without them falling apart after the first washing. These are high quality, big & soft. What more do you want from your towel? =)"
1,"100% Egyptian Cotton 725-Gram 6-Piece Towel Set, White",These towels are not absorbent. We bought different colors and we were so dispappointed with the quality of the towels.
2,towels,Quality was generally as high as one would expect for the price. Material is nice. Sewing finish flawed on a corner of one towel. Manufacturer's quality control should have caught.
2,Amazon's Pike Street Towels,"I was disappointed in these towels. They do feel cold, as other reviewers have said. I had read that, but had never experienced towels that 'felt cold'. I'm guessing that they are loaded with some softener and so don't absorb water well. This seems odd for Egyptian cotton.The price seemed too good to be true. $24.99 for six Egyptian cotton towels? It was."
2,It is not how it looks,Looks good and feels thick and awesome price. You would thinks it will be an great towel for drying. It was a disappointment. At least I did not pay much for this product.
4,heavy,"I was surprised when I got the shipment. They are heavy and with high quality, but a litter firm not soft!"
2,TOWELS DO NOT LAST,I THOUGHT THESE WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TOWELS BUT AFTER THE FIRST WASH THE EDGES STARTED TO UNRAVEL AND LOOK HORRIBLE!
1,No absorbancy,"I never have used a towel that didn't absorb SOME water, but these defy physics in that they are fabric but are incapable of absorption! They must be made of teflon or nylon. I can't believe they are ""Egyptian Cotton"" since cotton has absorbancy. Needless to say, they have been relinquished to our dog's bed for padding - luckily she doesn't have urinary accidents or else we wouldn't use them for her either."
3,not so soft after a while,"These are lovely and super soft at first sight-though after a couple of machine washes, the color is gone, and these are far away from the first day softness.-"
1,Still wet,"Although these towels look nice, they are not absorbent. After a few uses, we have started using them to clean the kitchen floor."
1,Horrible Quality,"The quality in these towels is such a shame, as i had hopes they would be worth their original price, not the sale price i grabbed them for on black friday. Unfortunately i barely see these worth that price. The edges are fraying after washing them twice, gently and they were never really fluffy. I think i'll demote these to rags in our house. Their absorbency is beyond lacking, the water sticks to the surface."
3,Have to wash about 6 times,"Although these towels are 100 percent Egyptian cotton, they come with that oily coating on them which means that they won't absorb water and it is hard to dry off with them. I washed them twice before using and still no good, finally after washing them about 6 times they are starting to become useful. Other than that, they are a good large size."
2,Good thing I bought these on sale,I'm happy I bought these on sale because after one washing the wash cloths started fraying at the seams. After two washings - they were more than frayed - they were unraveling.
2,cold and wet,They look like a good towel... until you start to dry off with them. The water seems to stay on the surface of the towel so as you dry off it feels cold and wet to the touch. I bought the Columbia brand towels at the same time and have been using them all the time as they seem to pull the moisture into the towel better.
1,avoid these towels,"Recent purchase of the Pike St 6 piece towel set was an unhappy one.The towels are not even seconds. They should have been offered as discards. They are full of long , strings as if used for abrasion. They are just an awful product that should have no stars. Run as fat as you can.The poorest Amazon product ever."
5,Great towels,"The Pike Street Towels were perfect for our new bathroom. Great quality. We have used these exclusively since receiving. The have been washed and dried several times. They have retained there color, size and quality. A great value priced item."
1,Not worth the $$,"These towels were not worth the money. They are thin (which would be fine) if they weren't so rough. I followed instructions on how to wash them and still, horrible.I do not recommend that at all"
5,Luxury bargain,"These towels are thick, soft, large, and very luxurious. Excellent value for the high quality."
5,Love my new towels,"If I had known the towels were going to be this great, I would have ordered more of them! They arrived quick and were better quality than I had expected."
5,kelly,"I am very satisfied with the towels & wash clothes they are very much more then i expected they would be . they are big, soft & fluffy. even my husband liked them Thanks, Mary"
5,elegant bath towels,I purchased these towels in conjunction with the Egyptian bed sheets and made a 3 tier wedding cake out of them for a wedding gift. Everyone commented on how soft and what great quality both items were. I would purchase these again . . and again . . and again . . it's sure to be a winner for your bathroom or a gift.
4,towel set,I gave these as a gift and wish i hadn't....I wanted to keep them for my self they were the softest towels i have ever felt and such a great price I'm on the lookout for a set for me.
2,"""85% savings"", First Hint of a Problem.","As long as you are expecting $20 towels and not $130 towels, maybe you won't be disappointed. These towels are not great quality, they look and feel okay, until you add water! They wash poorly, fiber feels cheap on your skin, color changes and for towels that allegedly ""List price $130"", not a quality buy."
3,Quality seems to be color dependent,"I purchased two sets of these towels: taupe and dark brown. The taupe towels are great (5 stars) - soft and absorbant, and have held up to several washes already. The dark brown towels are terrible (1 star). While the are soft, they seem to ""push around"" the water on your body rather than absorb it. They also shed small pieces of dark brown material that stick to your wet skin."
2,Egytian Cotton 725 gr. 6-piece towel set,"Towels do not absorb water, it gets wet as soon as I use it. It feels like I am drying myself with a wet towel. I also wish that they would have put the length in the description of the towel, it is very long."
3,"Decent value, color not accurately presented","As usual, Amazon provided me a great value and fast shipping. The towels are fine for the price. I wasn't expecting super thick or phenomenal fabric for $22/set of six. The quibble I have is that the Brick color presented on Amazon's website looks so much better than the product that was delivered. On the site, the color is vibrant and a deep red tilted toward the yellow side of the red spectrum. In reality, these are a sort of raspberry-ish color that lacks any vitality. If red can be dull, well this is it.I'll use them and write later about durability. For now, please be advised for the umpteenth time that the color you see on your computer, (I looked at this on 3 different systems,) might not be accurate.David"
1,Don't buy these towels,I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought these. These are the least absorbent towels I have ever used. I hope that I'm not going to have to fight Amazon when I call now to ask that they pay for the full amount of the shipping costs to send them back.
2,Quality is not up to expectation,"We are disappointed with the quality and the feeling of touching the towels. The quality is similar to the cheap towels purchased from Wal-Mart.However, thanks to Amazon, it allows us to return them with no cost."
2,Non abosrbent,Very soft but not sure why they don't absorb water like my other towels.I've washed twice since buying and don't use fabric softener.
1,Frays when washed,"These towels seemed nice when they arrived, but literally seem to be falling apart when laundered. Really disappointed with the purchase."
2,marginally disappointed,"I liked the texture of these towels, however, the seams along the edges are beginning to fray on both the big towels. I can fold them so they don't look raggy hanging on the rack. I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,Poor absorption,"I washed the towels several times as mentioned in previous reviews, but I find that the absorption remains poor. Perhaps so many fibers prevent good penetration? I would not purchase these towels again."
1,Very Poor Product,I have never had a towel this bad! After washing and drying there is more of the towel in the washer and dryer then you can imagen When I dry myself after a bath or shower there is towel lint in the tub and on me. I spend valuable time cleaning that up in the AM. Also this towel does not dry you off. It is not obsorbant I need one of my old towels to do the job and do not think this towel will dry your hair it is not happening. I am very disapointed no I am angry I spent a lot of money for 4 sets of these towels. Two of the sets fell apart ravelled in the wash leaving the side stitching hanging.I tell everyone I can Do not buy Pike Street Towels from Amizon all I can say is THEY ARE AWFUL!!!!!Susan Neipertdtmsfmaz@gmail.com
2,misleading,"i was super excited to get these towels when i placed the order. when i opened the package they felt soft and i was impressed until i went to use them and they are not all they're cracked up to be. they don't dry out my hair at all, the absorbancy of the towels is garbage. i was very disapppointed in the quality of the towels. Very soft but not absorbant at all."
2,they were shredding after first wash,don't touch these with a ten foot pole. they began to fall apart after the first wash.
2,Not sewn well!,"After the first wash, several towels had the thread at the seams come loose or break; very disappointing as the towels are very soft and would have purchased more in the future if better quality in the sewing department. The taupe color is not the usual color, however, the brick is very vibrant."
1,Rip off!!!,"On the screen looks great, but the actual towel lack a good finish and touch.The label really says 100%egyptian cotton, they can say whatever they wnat in it....Go to any bath and beyond or linens.. and you will find better stuff for a better price. I'm returning the ones I got from my wedding...."
5,Better than more expensive designer brands,"I bought these in a few colors (at a higher price) about a month ago. They were purchased to replace some designer catalog towels that I mistakenly thought would be of better quality. Well the designer towels shed about 1/2 their heft in my drier.So here I came to Amazon looking for a better alternative.I ordered 3 sets of these and am impressed with their drying ability and their feel. The towels are nice and thick and absorbent (like a towel should be, right?). The package of six include two sets -- making this an even better deal.I just went back and bought another three sets for use over the holidays with out of town guests. You won't be sorry with these. I am tossing my old towels and using these sets almost exclusively."
3,Just OK,"I bought three sets of these towels, in different colors. While there were no glaring flaws, right out of the bag there were a number (perhaps 2-5) of longer ""mis-weaves"" or ""thread tails"" on most of them. I fear that if I were to cut these shaggy bits off, it could affect the overall wear of the towels, but to leave them on looks untidy. If I were to buy towels in a store, I could go through the stack and pick out ones which had few or no flaws, and if you're picky like me you might well wish to do that rather than buy these towels. Otherwise, they seem to be fine, although they do shed a great deal of lint in the dryer everytime I wash them-- but that may be normal for this type of towel?"
1,"Poor quality towels, nice assistance on return","The price looked too good to be true, and it was. These towels were thin thin thin -- had I known my metrics maybe I would have realized that from the weight. I called Amazon, which provided a label for free return shipping, which I greatly appreciated. I am rarely disappointed in the quality of goods I buy through Amazon. I hope they won't offer these in the future."
2,"Soft towels, but I'm finding bits & pieces everywhere","I bought these towels in brick (red) for my guest bathroom. Out of the package they were soft and beautiful. I did a first washing before my guests arrived and found that although the towels didn't bleed, there was a lot of red lint in my washer and dryer filters. This didn't bother me because a lot of times towels need a first washing to get them ready for use. When my guests used them, they got red lint all over the shower, their bodies and the bathroom rugs. I washed these towels several times while my guests were here and the towels still shed. My guests are gone and I'm still picking up red lint all over the house because people tracked it in from the bathroom. One of the hand towels is already raveling at the side. I bought these towels because of the price and, as my husband says, you get what you pay for."
1,poor quality,Received a set of the towels- liked how they looked. Put them directly in the washer as I always do with new towels and they came out with frayed edges. although I had seen that had happened to someone else they were such a good deal...as usual...you get what you pay for. I am retuning them.
2,Unraveling,"Soft towels, bright colors. But, after the first wash more than one of them started unraveling at the edges, and I have towel-lint coming off, even after 5 washes or so. Low price, but not worth it really... Color stayed good, but I can't use these as guest towels, as intended. So price being low doesn't really help - I have to go buy another set that doesn't shred at the edges or shed lint."
2,You get less than what you pay for,"The first set of towels had to be returned as the sewing around the circumference of the towels was poorly done. Long strands thread were exposed, the type that would lead to the towel unraveling. However, the color across all towels was the same.Called Amazon service and in less than a week a new set was received. The exchange was quick, painless, and free.The second set were sewn significantly better, color was true, but as in with the first set, slightly lighter than what was pictured. However, it's close enough to my existing stuff to be acceptable.The towels aren't as plush as my mid-grade towels from BB&B;, but then again, I paid the same price for two entire towel sets from Amazon as I did for one bath towel from BB. You get what you pay for, but they're good enough.Edited 9/6/210 after the first wash in a front loader, the hand towels started to come apart. Apparently, these towels dissolve in water."
5,great value!,We knew thew were going to be a good value but they are much nicer and extremely absorbant towels. Now we can't get the two sets away from our teen-agers. Well we will have to order more but we can't wait for the daily deal. 9.5 out of 10.
1,Not so plush,"The picture of these towels makes them look really plush. The color was great, but I found them to be thin, and scratchy. I returned them."
1,Didn't even get to use them!,"We got these for Christmas and washed/dried them as the tag said to. Little did I know, they wouldn't even make it out of the dryer in one piece. The hand towels were completely frayed on one side and the rest of the towels were starting to fray. It's so sad that we didn't even get to use any of these and they are already trash."
2,"Beautiful, soft, absorbent and covered with pills!","Probably one of the nicest towel sets I've ever purchased in terms of texture, color and absorbancy. But what a disaster when it comes to shedding! I washed the towel set alone the first time and went to use it and it was covered with pills. Not hard nubs but lightweight, clingy and annoying. They were everywhere. So, if you've the patience to deal with the lint coverage, get these towels. If not, I recommend you find something else."
1,Horrible Quality,"Bought these towels during the Black Friday sales thinking they were a good purchase. After receiving the towels I washed them on gentle cycle warm which is less then they say you can wash them at, and dryed them on gentle low heat which again is lower then recommended. First wash never used and the towels fell apart, the whole sides became unraveled. Definately returning these towels would not recommend to no one."
1,fell apart,"I washed the set before I used them for the first time. After washing the items, they were falling apart! Strings were hanging off and there were tears in all of the towels and rags. This is a very poorly put together product and you should not purchase it."
1,shoddy construction,These towels were bought in October and are used by one person.The wash cloths and some of the towels are frayed and coming apart at the edges by early December!Indeed they are soft but the falling apart is a big negative for me.
3,"$25 YES, any higher NO","If these towels were not so cheap I would probably be upset about the quality. I have three sets. Two were purchased at the same time and another a year later. I have one set that is nice a fluffy, another one is limp and in need of some loving, and one set should have been returned. So there seems to be a quality control issue. The towels will loose there luster, but the fading has seemed to stabilize. So far the towels have held up well, no fraying. I do find them absorbent (TIP: Do not use fabric softener). In fact I was able to dry myself off with one hand towel.PRO: Inexpensive, absorbent, have held up over time.CON: Fading, quality control."
3,NOT OVERLY IMPRESSED,The towels feel great but after washing them before use one wash cloth and one hand towel came out of the dryer with frayed edges. The quality in workmanship is not that good....so I don't expect them to hold up when washed and dried over a period of time. I purchased them for my granddaughter for her college dorm so I wasn't too upset....as the price was fairly inexpensive. You get what you pay for is probably the best description of this purchase.
1,Garbage,"Do not buy these towels. They are pretty much terrible. After the first wash, three of them have the corners fraying and the other 3 unraveled quite a bit. Spend a bit more money and get a better product."
2,frayed and open seams,"I've ordered 8 of these sets over a year or so(different colors for all), and all was just fine until I got this pale green one. After removing from package and washing/drying to get out the creases etc., the towel, face cloth and washcloth were all frayed and open seamed.....I was very disapointed, the other orders I made were just fine and the towelas etc. were great. Since I had to pay to return it wasn't worth it to return. Looks like quality and quality control isn't working for them anymore"
1,Poor workmanship,"I have never even used these towels, they are just for decoration, and I have only washed them 2 times and the entire side of one of the bath towels and one of the hand towels have completely separated and it looks all ratty and tattered like I've had and used it for quite some time. I have only owned them 1 month. Complete junk. Nice material, but really poor quality workmanship. It's like putting a diamond in a plastic ring setting."
1,Stitching is poor quality,"I purchased these towels because of the low price. I now know why they are on sale. After the first wash the towels, hand towels and wash cloths all frayed at the edges. The stitching on the edges is not a very good quality. I would not recommend buying these towels. I am sending the ones I purchased back. Thank goodness Amazon is taking them back for a refund."
1,A Disgraceful Product,"Doesn't Amazon audit products before they offer them for sale. And when there are so many negative reviews of a product, why does Amazon continue to sale the product. Like many other customers, I found the towels were indeed not absorbent and after the first wash they started shredding at the edges. A disgrace. I find myself with two sets of towels that do not even qualify as rags."
2,Cheap is as cheap does,"Not crazy about these towels, I liked the price, but was expecting thicker towels than this. I wouldnt buy them again, but perhaps if you don't care about thickness of the material, they might be fine for you."
2,towel set,"The bath towels are absorbent, large, and soft. The first time that I washed the set one of the hand towels unraveled where the stripe is so I'm not too sure about the quality . . .though I'm still glad that I purchased the towel set as it matches my bathroom tile."
2,Soft but not absorbent,"These towels are very soft, however they fail to be ""thirsty"" and continue to loose fibers even after repeated washings, leaving me damp and flecked with towel fibers."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY! Cheap Towel Set.,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. I bought two sets, one of which I used and disliked very much but decided to keep as a guest bathroom set. I am returning the other set. When I opened the package they were already falling apart, ie the threads were coming undone but it felt soft so I thought I'd give it a try and see what they'd look like after I washed them. The thread situation was even worse, non the less I tried to use them and all I can say is that if you like still being wet after a shower then these are the towels for you. The dont soak up any water. Yes they are very soft, but are not functional as towels. I am very let down that amazon.com would sell these as their own product."
1,These towels bleed color in every wash cycle,"I purchased 3 sets of these towels approximately 3 months ago, and every single piece has bled a significant amount of its color. I enjoyed the low price when I bought them, but I absolutely would not recommend them to anybody else. The old adage 'you get what you pay for' definitely applies to this product. Stay away."
2,Pike Street Towel Set,"These did not work out well! After only a couple of washings, the sides of the towels started to lose their hem, and threads were just hanging. They were wonderfully soft, but I would not order these again!"
5,Happily pleased with my towels,"Pike Street 100% Egyptian Cotton 725-Gram 6-Piece Towel Set, CreamThis towel set can only be described as plush. The soft cotton in these towels feels wonderful on your body as it quickly absorbs moisture. Though they are thick and luxurious, they dry quickly. Want to buy more, but the cream color was out of stock the last time I looked."
4,Great value,We love the towels and find that they are good quality at a very affordable price. We would recommend these towels to anyone. Thank you Amazon for offering this product.
