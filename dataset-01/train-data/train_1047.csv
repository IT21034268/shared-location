4,the Hunger Games,"All in All a pretty decent movie. I think Jennifer Lawrence is a Good Actor, It had good action and it didn't have all of the over the top special effects, which I am beginning to get tired of watching."
5,Awesome!!,"Great movie, i downloaded the books on my kindle before i went and saw this and i must say they stuck pretty close to the books."
1,Hunger Games,"I mistakenly ordered this film in HD. My system cannot download HD... I discovered. So, I have never seen the movie. But, I was charged for it. Customer Service said tough luck."
1,I didn't buy it.,I didn't buy it. I didn't buy it. I didn't buy it. I didn't buy it. I didn't buy it. O K â€” I didn't buy it.
2,I don't. get. these 4 and 5 star reviews,"""Brilliant""' ""masterpiece""-sure if you're into young kids being killed throughout the movie, I have 2 young sons at home and this movie scared the you know what out of me-I just don't get it."
2,Not too thrilled about the storyline,"This movie was very depressing, had me choked up half the time, crying, and upset that there is just too much bad things that happen........"
1,Pretty Turrible,"Yes I spelled terrible wrong on purpose, but honestly this movie was just awful. It can't have helped that I didn't realize it was pg or whatever before renting it, and therefore didn't get all the nudity and extremely graphic violence I was looking forward to. Anywho, the movie may be cool if you were into the books or are under the age of 9. Even though I was looking forward to imagined carnal undertones, this movie was lacking in every respect and I still stopped watching before the end, which is a big deal for me."
1,Godzilla Meets Bambi was better,"Terrible, To Long, Not Enough action, very slow, and just all around time consuming... its like they tried to hard with the movie, when all they had to do, was hit the off button on the camera. id rather watch mickey mouse slaughter goofy then this ever again. Disappointed...."
3,Hunger Games Video Review,"The video was good and I enjoyed it. I will probably watch it several times. Even though it followed the storyline of the book, it did not cover enough to explain everything that was happening, which made it a little dis-jointed. I think it should have been longer, at least enough to help the viewer understand why and what was really happening.I still gave it 3 stars because I enjoyed watching it and will again."
3,Not worth the hype,"I was so excited about the movie coming out on video because I only saw half of it in the theaters because I got sick. I finally watch the movie and it was not as awesome as everybody made it out to be. Yeah it was a good movie but not something to fall over and rave about. Basically, I've seen better movies...."
5,What I expected,"Great film, although I liked the book better. Very good visual effects and faithful to the original story. I liked that with the purchase of the DVD you also get a digital copy that you can keep in your computer/mobile phone. The extras are also interesting for those who are Hunger Game suckers!!"
4,Hunger Games,Never read the book but was familiar with the premise. Knowing there would be sequels took some of th edge off but still kept enough of the tension to keep you interested. Looking forward to the next one.
2,Where is the hype?,"Where should I start? This movie sucked so hard I felt I had been robbed $3.99! The hype for this movie left me wanting to see it. It failed completely. There is very little consistency in the story line. The ""rules"" of the game are changed, changed again, then changed back again, and then thrown out completely. They announce that there will only be one announcement during the game, then they make 4 more. The plot/storyline was so easy to read ten minutes into the future. Only two words describe this movie; lame & ripoff. I would recommend waiting till the rights of the movie expire, then watch it for free when you have nothing else to do. I hope there will not be a sequel."
1,BluRay software has to be UPDATED?,"Surprise! If you are like me and did not know there has been updates to BluRay software, you will not be able to get this or other new BluRay disks to work. since this is not a 3D movie, save yourself a headache and get the DVD instead of the BluRay."
2,Hollywood please stop!,Is this what people are capable of appreciating? This is a garbage movie. Stick to Tarantino and Coen Brothers if you insist on hollywood movies. Mostly everything else is so vapid it's not even worth the keystrokes. Namaste.
1,Horrible movie,"Besides its deliberately controversial theme of kids engaged in a violent reality show, the movie does not catch one's attention in any other way. It has freely drawn elements from the Roman gladiator arena, 18th century european aristocracy (only the make-up), WWII jewish ghettos etc., without contributing any original idea in return (not even on the sci-fi front). Can one use the movie as the basis of a discussion with kids of the horrors in humanity's own past? Not really, because it handles the theme of societies gone wrong in a cartoonish manner that does not capture any of the complexity behind these events."
1,Remember Eragon? Yup,"Worst film adaptation of a brilliant book I have seen in years. They are adaptations because wriitten story form does not perfectly translate to visual, things must be condensed, altered in order to tell the story in a decent amount of time, but it must be done carefully, with respect to the original work, the message, the characters, the fans, and the artist behind them. Honestly, I loved the book, usually I'm defending film adaptations of wonderful books; this time I can't. It was terrible, I haven't seen an adaptation this awful since Eragon. The acting was fine, the costuming was okay, the fault lies with director and screenwriter as far as I can tell. If you haven't seen it spare yourself."
1,Could not watch the streamed version,"Locked up every few seconds while trying to watch it. Gave up trying to watch it after about 30 minutes and drove to a Redbox to rent it. I have rented streamed movies from Amazon in the past without problem, not this time. It only takes once to screw me out of money though. I will not rent another streamed movie from Amazon."
4,Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic!,A great movie to go along with the book. As a parent I appreciate the way the movie producers handled the violence parts.
4,Cool.,A fantastic fantasy story. :-) I know this movie was made for little girls mostly but it grabbed me with the art directionand the interesting story. It's been a while since I've seen a dramatic sci-fi fantasy film that hit a homer.
5,Awesome Movie!,"I heard so many good things about this movie, I just had to see it. It met all my expectations and more. Great transaction, I love getting movies through Amazon."
1,Nothing like the book!,The movie was nothing like the book. I was awful. If you love the books don't watch the movie as you will be greatly disappointed!
1,hunger games,I really did not like this movie. Do not go to movies because of my handicap was a waist of my money.
1,Waste of film,Pointless cinema. Storyline was kind of original but that only due to the books. Some stories just aren't meant for the big screen.
3,Not THAT great.,"This movie has been way over-rated. The acting was subpar, special effects weren't that good, and the make-up looks like it was ripped off from Alice in Wonderland. Glad I waited to see it on video."
3,Great Story,Very good movie. I wanted the DVD because I was impressed with the screenplay and the acting. I found it very interesting.
3,Hungry for more,Unlike the book the main character is too pretty and well fed and this part bothered me because it removes credibility to her intentions and motivations.The Hollywood beautiful teeth and heathy people do not fit properly.The story was close enough that I enjoyed it but felt that it was too summarized and wouldn't have a crowd of followers would it not have been for the wonderful books.
2,Very sad they veered so far from the book.,I don't know if you have read running man and then watched the movie but the same happened for this. The things they omitted and changed to me ruined it. Maybe if I had not read the books first it would have been better.
3,The movie was so so,The Hunger Games movie was just so so for me but I am 66 years old so more for the younger crowd. My graddaughter (age 14) loved it. Amazon is so great to work with. Delivery is always on time and they make it so easy if you have to return anything.
2,For kids....,"This movie has created a lot of buzz, and being a fan of Jennifer Lawrence I decided to stream it from Amazon Prime.I'm a huge fan of Amazon Prime, especially the shipping, so I consider the opportunity to stream movies, icing on the cake.The movie premise was far-fetched to me. I've seen this story line before. It turns out the whole affair wasn't my cup of tea. Probably if I was only a quarter old as I am now, I would have enjoyed it more."
2,Not really that good,"Let me say first that I never read ""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins and maybe if I had I would life the movie more. But since I have not I can only just ""The Hunger Games"" the movie. After watching it, I can safety say that I will not be reading the books or buying any of future movies. I just thought that the whole movie was awful. One of the thing that I found strange was durning movie there were long period of silence, which seem strange to me.""The Hunger Games"" the movie was clearly made for the fans of the books and if you didn't read the books it would be hard to follow what is happening. Overall, for me this movie was not a keeper"
4,cliff notes,It felt like you are watching the book on fast forward. everything was cut down. one example was the parade scene. seems like it was about a minute long. i left the theater feeling exhausted because it felt like i was speed reading.
2,previews,I have played this title 2 times and it seems they force me to watch these previews.This totally destroys any possible postives about this disc. It's a shame.The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]
3,Weird,"I don't know what I was expecting but with all the hype I didn't think it was a movie about children murdering children, a little strange for me."
3,not as good as the book,"not even as close to as good as the book and i dont think the book is all that, either. the characters could have been much more developed, just a big let down for such a big hype."
3,Hunger Game Movie Review,"If you didn't read the book the movie might be difficult to follow. I don't recommend buying the movie, better to rent it for your viewing pleasure."
3,Not Bad but...,"Not as good as the book. I expected a lot more from this movie, but I probably shouldn't have because the book itself wasn't all that great. I still find it a lot easier to stomach than Twilight, which is probably what everyone says..."
3,Okay,"I saw this movie in theaters, thought it was just okay. Then I read the book and liked it a lot so I thought maybe I would like the movie more if I saw it again. I was wrong. I don't know why but I just didn't dig this movie. Hope the sequels are better."
3,Somewhat disappointed,I looked forward to this movie for a long time as my husband and I don't go to theaters very often. I was somewhat disappointed in this film.
4,Good movie.,The movie followed the book very well. I am very pleased with how fast I received the movie. Thank you.
3,For Teeny Boppers,The star has only one expression and botox type lips. Not appealing. Poor little Roux spear in gut but not a cry does she make. What a nice little teen romp. Lord of the Flies with costumes.LOL
1,Perpetuates Feminist Myths,"This movie perpetuates the feminist myth that women are as strong as men, and the myth that women are warriors.This only occurs in fiction, and with affirmative action, e.g., military and police lower physical standards in order for women to have careers there.Arghhh... a delusional backdrop to the movie, and a waste of two hoursJim"
1,Hunger Games.,This movie is supposed to be for teenager and all younger kids wanna watch this..I won't let my kid watch this because this movie is ignorant & i have no clue why so many people like this & I do let my kidswatch a lot of things that are not age appropriate.
3,so-so...book was better,"The movie jumped around a bit. I felt if I hadn't read the book the movie would have been harder to follow the story line. For being in a life of misery and doing with out in district 12, you have to admit Katniss is pretty hot!! Will wait and see how the sequel brings in district 13."
4,A very good movie,"I realy didn't know a lot about hunger games but enjoy the movie and now i am a fan,heartfelt action pack,real could happen movie"
3,Eh. It was ok.,"Movies are fun, but books are better. This movie is no different. It was neat to see the characters and the setting come to life, but you really must read the books to understand the complexity of the relationships between characters. The film quality appeared low budget and had a somewhat independent film feel to it. Bottom line, the movie is no substitute for the written- read the trilogy, you will not be disappointed. I purchased the books, I would not purchase the film."
1,The Hunger Games,"I had to take back the first copy that I bought because it would not play in my blu-ray player. when I got the sceond copy I traded in because the first one would not play it would not play either. This is the first time I could not get a product to work. I really wantedd to see the movie too. I just wonder how many more bad copies there are out there, that the public is buying that does not work. Neither discs worked, the movie or special features."
1,The Hunger Games,"I pre ordered it on June 28, 2012. The movie came out in the market I work in on August 17th. The Blueray is the same price as the pre ordered copy. And it's August 20th at 4:33 pm and it hasn't arrived yet. I am pissed!!!!"
1,worst movie of the year,"I watched this on pay per view and it sucks.One problem is the books are so detailed , and the film just skims the surface.it barely gets into her relation with Gale and her past, taking over the family after her father dies. It also does not go into detail about her past with Peta and the bread. The books are great and I enjoyed every one. The books also go into a lot depth about her life, and the movie does not. I have read countless books in my life, and this one i will remember.I liked the Transformers movies much more. The writers got the long history of the war and Megatron and Optimus Prime with out it being the focus of the movie.If only they had managed that with this movie.If you have not read the books ye, do that and forget this movie. I know I will.The odds were not in this movie's favor by a long shot!"
1,Ultraviolet,Doesn't matter how good the movie is I refuse to buy this due to Ultraviolet. Hollywood is taking us back to the year 2002 with their technology. Unfortunately I'm living in 2012.
1,hmmm,"so said you could watch it at 1201 , so I paid for it and now its not in my video stuff grrrr stayed up for nothing, guess I will have to wait till next week now unless i want to spend money again with xbox"
1,ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY REVIEW,Ultraviolet SUCKS! GIVE US THE OPTION TO BYPASS THAT CRAP AND DOWNLOAD TO ITUNES! Ultraviolet is the worst product ever!
2,Mediocre.,One star for Jennifer Lawrence. One star for the cool premise. The film itself is rather bland and cheap-looking when Katniss isn't involved in the games. Over-rated and doesn't live up to the hype.
1,Worst movie of 2012,"This is nothing more than propaganda to corrupt our children. After 30 mins into it, I just turn it off and went out to get some air as I found this film utter trash. Jerky camera, worthless plot, just skip this garbage."
4,Hunger Game,"The movie was wery entertaining but fell short in providing adequate background information. After reviewing the movie, I purchased all three books and then watched the movie again. I am anxiously awaiting the second movie of the trilogy."
5,Good movie....,"I'm not going to bore anyone with a long review of the story, that if you didn't already know you probably wouldn't be buying the DVD. Fast shipping, good movie, decent price. What more do you want ?"
4,Hunger Games,This film is packed full of action from the beginning to the end. Some of the characters were a little far-fetched but they played well into the film. A glimpse of future humanity.
4,"Enjoyable, but too short.",Movie was well made with good acting~really would have liked it to be longer so all the great parts from the book could be shown. Looking forward to the next 2 movies.
4,Hunger Games,The book was much better. I was a little disappointed in the movie although it was good I think it could have been better.
3,could have been better,"Cantiss was great, but the supporting cast was not so good. Sutherland as Snow was a joke. overall the acting was at best mediocer. the master of ceremmonies was pretty good. the tributes as whole seemed pretty nonshalant about there situation. they are all going to die but one. you would never know it by the way they acted. still i enjoyed the movie but it could have been better."
4,Left me Hungry,"I usually do like the book better than the movie but in this case, I liked them both. The movie you can understand why it needed to be cut shorter and left a few things out that may have helped the plot but all in all it was great. The make up was good, the acting was great, I really enjoyed it. I do Hope they have a sequel to follow the rest of the series."
4,Hard to translate,"The book was more involved but I thought that this was a pretty good adaptation to screen. The screenwriter was able to glean the important parts from the novel, and successfully keep the story. I felt that the book was more intense."
4,Well done,"A surprisingly low key movie that flows nicely. Scary stuff if you think very much about this dystopian world, but a well acted and directed movie that is enjoyable to watch (if a bit disturbing in places)."
5,My first blu-ray,"This movie was awesome, the blu-ray picture is so great! I could not believe how awesome the picture looked. AWESOME!"
5,Watch it,"Loved the book, the movie was well done and true to the book as much as it could be. Watch it."
5,Great movie...,"... even better book! Love the blu-ray. I have a big, awesome TV, and I really enjoy using it to it's fullest capabilities, which is what blu-ray is all about."
5,The Hunger Games,really enjoyed it had read all the trilogy and movie was pretty true to the book except not as much about her life before the games.
5,Hunger Games,The movie is as good as the book. I can't wait for the next movie to come out. I'm sure it will be just as good.
4,BATTLE ROYALE REMAKE - Just Tamer!,"The Japanese version of this movie was down-right brutal.Brutal you say? I thought Hunger Games was brutal? Well, not really if you've seen it's predecessor movie - Battle Royale.It's an interesting concept and a movie of ""Love Thy Neighbor, but Just Be Sure that you Kill Them Before They Kill You!""I recommend that you watch the Japanese version of this movie first. Then Hunger Games will seem like a nice Walt Disney special playing for the family on Sunday evening.I recommend this movie for anyone who is under water on their mortgage.Enjoy!"
4,Worth Seeing,A good movie that seems to be very true to the book. I am anxious to see if the next one is this well done.
5,Hungry for More,"This was an amazing film, and I love it! It has everything you could want in a movie: drama, comedy, romance, and plenty of action. I don't usually purchase DVD's, but this is a special movie."
4,good movie,"I enjoyed the movie, they did as much of the book as possible without making it 5 hours long...CGI is rough early on but good after the entrance to the arena."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype!,"If you've been living in a cave for the past year and don't know what a Hunger Game is...then this movie is for you. Not a bad flick, but had no chance of living up to all the hype around it."
2,Didn't Live up the hype,"The hype for this movie worked. I was excited to finally see the big movie. Well I learned that they spend most of the movie on advertising. With big actors in the movie with good writing, but movies showed all these lead to a boring and a surprising under eventful movie. I been told that the book is better.The Hunger Games"
2,Hunger Games Movie,"I've read all three books and was looking forward to the movie I purchased. I'm aware it's hard to make a movie from such an outstanding book such as the Hunger Games series. With that being said, I was VERY disappointed in the movie. It was a VERY poor example of what might have been done with that book. It covered such a few actual chapters of the Hunger Games story line and much of the information was incorrect (e.g. Madge gave Katniss the mockingjay pin NOT Prim). The actors were poorly chosen from the mental description from the book (e.g. Woody Harrelson as Haymich. PLEASE!!! How insulting). I'll not watch nor purchase any other of the series books movies if they are made. The books were AWESOME!!! I compare the accuracy to the movie made of Clan of the Cave Bear. It was ALSO a poor example of a GREAT book by Jean Auel!!!! I've not talked to even one person who really liked the movie compared to the book and they are also not willing to purchase another butchered movie!!!!"
3,Ok Movie,"Ok movie, worth your time if your bored with nothing else to do for an hour. The book is much better."
2,"Good premise, poor execution","After hearing so many people rave about this series, I felt I had to give it a try. While the premise was good, I felt the execution was lacking. There were so many dismal holes in the plot, I felt that it was a disservice to the young adult market that they were targeting. The author didn't give the young adults any credit for intellectual reasoning. I have read many young adult books that were handled much better."
2,Children killing children was disturbing,"The movie was well made, exciting and a little bizarre, but the biggest impact it had on me was a theme of children killing other children for the entertainment of the elite classes, and to win food for their very deprived colony, was disturbing at best. Ultimately the victory of a representative of the ""mining colony"" which they go to great lengths to have all colonies other than colony one (whose children are trained for the games their entire lives), is rewarding, but the movie ends with the evil leader of the planet upset over her victory, and you know it's only going to get worse in sequels. I will never watch it again, because the images of children killing other children, primarily for the entertainment of the ruling/elite classes was so upsetting that I don't consider that to be ""entertainment"" that I enjoy and would watch ever again.The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]"
3,"Well made flick, but read the book,,,much better","I read the book first. My wife has not read the book. While watching the movie, I kept having to explain what was going on to her, as the movie left so much of the storyline out. There's also some storyline liberties taken that were not in the book at all, but I won't spoil it for anyone here. It's a well made movie, good acting for the most part, and cinematography, but the screenplay writers and film editors should be go back to school and retake whatever courses they missed or flunked."
3,"Good, not great",The movie was pretty good. Katniss character was excellent.Omissions/edits from the book leave the movie a bit lacking.Woody...surprisingly pretty good.
3,Not that Hungry,"low fat , small portion..didn't really get moving at any time , and the games seemed pointless...maybe the books were more interesting...really worth 2 1/2 stars"
2,The Hunger Games,I thought the movie was lacking in a lot of areas. I had read the book first which was awesome but when I saw the movie it went through the scenes too fast and didn't concentrate on certain areas that I wished it had.
3,Better than I expected,"I am usually somewhat dubious of the hyped movies, but was pleasantly surprised that the movie was enjoyable. I don't like the typical endings that we see on most movies (allowing much room for a sequel) like this one. However, the story line was not as child like as i had expected after it was suggested by my daughter and not as gory as I had imagined it might be."
3,It was Ok,This movie was ok but a bit of a let down after all the hype. I really wish I had not read the book so I might have enjoyed it more. Just was a little flat.
5,Must have Hunger Games,I saw this movie at the theaters and had to have the DVD - It is a must for your collection
5,Great movie.,The movie represents the story told in the book very well which is unusual. A great addition to the video library.
4,Good Movie,I really liked this movie. I read the books and they were really good the book is better than the movie they had to leave some out that's why 4 stars
5,A pleasant Surprise,"I was surfing my amazon prime instant videos and came upon this movie by luck. I knew nothing about it nor recognised any of the listed staring actors. At a $3.99 rental fee for an evenings entertainment at home I figured what the hey. What a delightful surprise. Once into the movie I recognized some very fine costars and supporting actors and actresses in Donald Sutherland with superb but very little screen time, Woody Harrelson, who also put in a fine performance,the always enjoyable Stanley Tucci who is just absolutely on fire in Television and movie roles, and Elizabeth Banks (The 40 year old virgin and Seabiscuit. I did not see the burning Plain but it doesn't surprise me that the lead Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for an Academy award as she put in just a stellar performance in this movie. This was a very well made movie that keeps ones interest throughout with no weak, dull, or boring moments."
4,It was fine,This was a good movie. Will most likely buy the books because it was so good. It pulled yo in to another world of a possible future.
4,GayleeCA,"I expected a bit more based on the hype of this movie. However, I really liked it and look forward to the next sequel."
5,Awesome and engaging,"Beyond amazing! This movie is cutting edge, engaging, awesome, and exciting. I find myself re-reading the books over and over and now I can watch the movie to glimpse the world of Panam once more."
5,Hunger Games Has Us Cheering On Our Feet!,"The movie is an excellent film on just how bad civilizations can become if allowed! Children forced to kill other children in order to not only survive, but to improve their districts food allowances for the sake of entertaining the Capitol and it's citizens. Bucking the system can bring reprisals in unusual forms as the next movie in the series will demonstrate. It is a very good story on why ""not"" to allow a government to control every aspect of their citizens lives!"
4,Worth watching,"We did not read the book, so I cannot compare it with that. We did really enjoy the movie, although I found the ""critters"" that they used at the end in the climax to be a bit cheesy. I have been told that if they had attempted to use them as written in the book it would have been even more cheesy, so I'm glad they changed it. I have definitely recommended it to friends as a really interesting story idea that was well-acted and fun to watch."
5,Hunger games Blu-ray,I was very happy with buying Hunger games after watching it to see what many were talking about. And because I am a fan of Josh HutchersonI felt like I was part of the action as the game was being played. I would have to say this movie is well worth buying and watching for the unendlessaction in it. All the actors did a amazing job with the parts.
4,Enjoyable movie,"I loved the book and enjoyed the movie, as well. I didn't like it as much as the book, but still found it a reasonable portrayal of the story and characters. Seeing it all come to life was exciting. If you haven't read the book, I think the movie would still be very good. Several people I know saw the movie without reading the book and still really enjoyed the movie."
4,Hunger Games does not leave one wanting,Great all around movie! Young cast does an amazing job. Woody Harrelson fills our the role of the burnt out mentor to perfection!
4,very good movie,The picture quality on the Hunger Games blu-ray was great. The story was very good. I would definitely recommend this blu-ray movie.
5,Loved this flick,It was a great flick for me which kept me on the edge of my seat; I didn't read the books and now I'd like to.
3,Good Movie for Teens,"I watched the movie & I liked it because it was something different. It was somewhat of a Sci-Fi type of movie. I think it appeals more to a less mature audience. Teenagers will love it, especially if they are fans of Josh Hutcherson & Jennifer Lawrence. The movie was well done & it had it's ups & downs. I'm sure if you watch it you will enjoy it. I don't think it's Oscar worthy but all in all it was a pretty good, different kind of movie. It was something like the Avatar movie but not nearly as good. I gave it 3 stars but I'm sure kids between the ages of 10 - 15 will probably give it 5 stars."
2,Disliked,"Despite the crowds who did like it - I did not care for the Hunger Games. Making a game of violent death for the loser, is not my idea of family entertainment."
5,Hunger Games!!!,"I love this movie!! I would recommend it to everyone!!This movie is amazing and the cast was casted perfectly, I don't think they could have gotten anyone better to play any of the characters!"
5,The Hunger Games,"The movie was well done, as was the acting. There were a few moans and groans from those who loved the book, but that is to be expected from any movie adaptation. Looking forward to the sequel."
5,The Hunger Games,"The video we purchased was excellent; we have seen it at the theater, but wanted to be able to show others who usually don't go to the movies. Came quickly, no flaws in the packaging."
5,Kept your interests,I loved the movie. I do have to say the book was better because it has so much more detail and you know what the character is actually thinking whereas the movie skips a lot of scenes from the book. But I really liked the actors they chose for each character. Its a great movie and the books were great. Excited for the next movie!
4,Great Movie with an Original Story,"I really liked this movie because it offered something fresh from the movie industry that otherwise seems to recycle old trusted and tried storylines. I was initially concerned about the violent nature of the kids hunting kids theme, but found it was not overly portrayed in the film and thus not quite as offensive."
4,Worth watching,"I was unsure if I wanted to see this movie because of the disturbing and gruesome premise, but it was well directed with good acting, lending itself to the PG13 rating. It was worth watching."
5,Great!,Wonderful film. Looked great on my new flat screen TV. Looking forward to my next purchase.The connection was good.
4,Kept me interested,"I was a little bored the first 15 minutes and thought I was going to hate it, but once it got going, it was awesome. Has the action, drama, love story, and a little comic relief thrown in. I read the books and will really be looking forward to the second and especially the third."
4,The Hunger Games,"The movie was very good and the video quality, for the most part, was quite good. Amamzon does a good job of having quality videos to choose from and the Prime selection is getting better!"
5,Great MOvie!!,"I love this show, it is great. It follows the book well. I am excited for the other books of the series to come out too."
2,Poor Story!,Just a poor story all around. The actors looked bad. The Story line was bad.The lead acting was fair to good. I'm glad I didn't buy it!Skip
2,Dissapointed,"I guess I didn't realize the story was written for a 14 year old audience. It was ok, it just wasn't as good as I was expecting"
2,If you have read the book dont watch the movie.,This is just my opinion but if you have read the book I would not watch this movie. There is so much going on emotionally in the books that just never really makes it to the movie.
2,Let down,It played one time fine then the second time it started to skip by the third time it just locks up about mid way. Really diappointed. Never had a problem with anything I've purchased before.
3,Should absolutely be R-rated,"The movie, in and of itself, strikes an interesting look at humanity in general. However, when a tall teenager grabs a younger teen and spins his head around killing him, this movie definitely merits an R-rating. It's not shown off screen either. Taking a 13 year old child to this movie is completely irresponsible. The MPAA should be ashamed of itself. It's absolutely amazing what they can get away with now in PG-13 movies."
5,Really enjoyed both the books and the movie,"I was helping a neighbor of mine with her English 101 class - and she had the read The Hunger Games. So I read it, too. I'm no YA but I remember back to what I was reading when I was young - a lot of Ray Bradbury, to name one - and I found this a thrilling YA book. So thrilling that I consumed the remainder of the trilogy. The film was very, very good - very enjoyable - and stands on it's own even if you haven't read the book. Terrific casting, acting and directing. Kudos, too, must go to the costume and set designers for their view of the 'Capitol' - just the over-the-top look that you imagine when reading the book. All in all, a 5-star movie."
3,Nutty Movie,"Heard the hype, like everyone else in the states, but wasn't too interested in it. Haven't read the book, but finally caved a week or two ago... there's gotta be something to the talk, right? Well, it turns out to be one of the most surprising movies. Not because of superb acting, awesome visual effects, or extraordinary cameos (although I didn't expect Natural Born Killers dude to be in it). It was surprising because of the unassuming, ""natural,"" nonchalant way with which the kids in the movies killed each other. I understand that it is part and parcel of the world that the movie depicts, but I didn't expect it to be just so in a movie that seemed to be squarely marketed at young children. If I were a parent, I would not want my child seeing this movie, unless they were 15+.That aside, the movie isn't great, but the movie doesn't totally suck."
4,"Great movie, lackluster special features","Obviously The Hunger Games is great, but I wish that there had been a few more special features to round out this edition of the movie. Specifically an audio commentary could have been helpful to add more depth to the movie as it goes on. Instead we are left with mostly interviews which basically say how great and nice everyone was. Nothing we couldn't already figure out."
5,The Hunger Games,We all loved the movie. Almost like the book. Can't wait tell the other two books are made into movies.
2,Once is probably enough,"This is a film with high production value. However, the plot is simple and the outcome is easily predicted after the first 10 minutes. The storyline follows a Myth format. It's just a matter of enjoying each battle between our heroine and her foes to its predictable conclusion. You may not need (or want) to see it a second time."
2,kids killing kids,"This is not a very good movie. Perhaps if one had read the book, it would make more sense. But I have not read the book and so all I saw was kids killing kids and two kids win, just in time for a second movie."
4,"great movie, but really read the book first","if you hadn't read the books before you saw this movie, you probably had no idea what was going on sometimes. the momentary flashbacks, her sitting in the rain while peta threw her burnt bread, etc. those were probably really strange to some of you. i LOOOOVED the books, the movie was okay by hollywood standards, but it just does not do the books justice. i will watch the other two, but i am not expecting magic. please, read the books, then watch it. it will help."
4,The hunger games,"Good movie, was very entertaining, would make you jump out of your seat at times. I would definitely recommend it for viewing, the violeence is well subdued by director."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All I can say is the movie was graet,it looked real. I just hope we CAN DO BETTER WHEN OR IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS."
4,Excellent movie!,"Great movie, although of course a bit different than the book. Looking forward to the next installment in the series!"
4,Stellar adaptation from the book!,"Often, the movie adaptation of a book leaves you disappointed. That was not the case with The Hunger Games. The way they presented the story was absolutely fantastic and I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the book."
4,The hunger games,"I downloaded this movie through my TiVo! Thanks Amazon for having this feature on TiVo. Great movie, entertaining all through out! Cant wait for the sequel."
4,True to the book.,I had just read the book and was surprised to see that it followed the book very very very well.
2,the hunger games (movie),"the movie was o.k. I thought there would have been a little more ""umph"" to it considering all the hype up to its release. It kind of moved slow. The first half was good but then it started to get slow and I did not like where it was going. I hear the the book is way better but I do not like to read so I personally cannot tell you that. It could be the director of the movie that made it seem like it was drawn out. They say there is going to be a part 2, and part 3 to this but I most likely will not watch them."
5,Awesome!!,"A breath of fresh air!! Great movie, well done!! It's nice to see something in the movies that succeed other than vampires/werewolves"
5,great movie!,"great movie combining modern events, roman history, politics, and human emotions all into one. Definitely one to view if you like action movies!"
5,great movie,Very good movie my husband And i watched it And loved it. We never thought it was going to be that good.
4,Good... Not great.,"I thought it was very good but considering just how much killing is part of the storyline, I definitely think that the movies are made to please kids, more than adults. Jennifer Lawrence was great and so was Elizabeth Banks but the rest of the acting was just okay."
1,TERRIBLE,"The movie was boring and for it to be 2 and a half hours long, there could've been more details from the book to incorporate in the story line....everything happened so fast that it seemed to leave out the descriptives of why the different scenes were actually taking place."
1,Hunger games,This was mindless teenage drivel. The only thing it had going was an unlimited publicity budget.It was the same old bread and circuses with young love thrown into the mix. Do not bother with this one.
4,Hunger for More,Great first entry of this trilogy and pretty good adaptation of the book. Can't wait for the remaining 2 movies!
5,A decent variation of the book,"It's difficult to shrink a novel down into a believable two hours, but as a stand alone story, I enjoyed it, as did all my nieces."
4,Nice movie for the young generation,"Having read the book series, I was interested to see how the movie would play out. I have to say it was pretty close and the movie characters were lose to how the book describes them. Great movie for young teenagers."
3,"book much better, movie tries","If I hadn't read the book first would have thought this movie was just about kids killing kids. The movie doesn't introduce the characters the way the book did. Rue wasn't just this kid that got killed, she was more than that. I know in a movie you have to keep it short but the humanizing element wasn't there."
2,Skips,"My DVD set skips a ton. No scratches, no marks, no smudges. It just gets frozen at the same three places every single time. Because Amazon gave me the instant video version for free, I am still able to watch it. But this purchase is one I am really disappointed in."
3,The Hunger Games Movie,"THE BOOK IS INDESCRIBABLY BETTER. It was a cold shower for me. I rented this movie out of curiosity. It's not worth the purchase. Instead, I choose to read the Trilogy for the 3rd time."
2,A difficult job...,"I read the Hunger Games long before I saw the movie. The premise was the sort I loved as a young man but seems more implausible today. Nonetheless I forced myself to ""get into it"" and enjoyed the book adequately enough. But because of the restrictions forced by a movie of about two hours, hardly any book can be presented on screen in its entirety. And, in the case of Hunger Games, that restriction is fatal. Too much like using a cartoon strip to depict War and Peace. So if you stay away from the book, maybe the movie is passable (for example, I loved Avatar). But Hunger Games is a story that requires more depth than a movie can hold."
3,Not for seniors,"The Hunger Games is enjoyable enough. Well acted, good photography, special effects, sound track, all well done. But, the story is contrived and predictable right up to the end (an obvious setup for the inevitable sequel). The characters are unrealistic and idealized. The motivations, the relationships, the whole social ethos is badly out of sync. I think it's for young people looking for clear cut heroes that challenge the evil status quo. It's good action/adventure/romance but please don't consider it as serious drama."
3,Just not my cup of tea,"I thought I was going to just love this movie, but not so much. Everybody else I've spoken to says it's a great movie and they really enjoyed it."
5,Hunger Games Blu ray,The blu ray dvd set is excellent. The extras disk is worth the price alone. If your fan of the movie get this product.
4,I liked it: ),I feel that Hunger Games was a good movie. I did not think I would like it but it surprised me. I can't wait for part two. If you have not seen it you should check it out.
4,Sad!,The depiction of our future is bleak at best. Great acting and action packed right from the beginning. Ya gotta watch it!
5,Very entertaining movie!,"Well this is coming from someone whose never read any of the books. I had no clue what this movie was even about before I watched it. Well, it ended up being a pretty good movie. I would recommend it to everyone I know."
5,The Hunger Games DVD,I would recommend watching this movie! I would recommend purchasing this movie. It is one you will want to see. The acting is very good in this movie.
5,I love this movie,This movie was a great buy instores it cost at least twentry-one dollars I would definely recommend this one to friends.
4,Good Movie,Its not as good as the book but still a very good movie. Most movies that are made from books aren't as good as the book and while this is true for this movie I still think its better than most other movies made from a book.
4,Food for thought,"Did find this to be suspenseful and beautifully filmed but not as exciting as all the pre-releases stated. Entertaining, but horrific concept."
4,Hunger Games movie,Good movie. It mostly followed the book. I will watch the sequel Catching Fire when it comes out. Hopefully it will be as good.
3,Didn't live up to the Book,"As usual the movie couldn't capture the feeling that the book created. The movie was still pretty good and she is a good actress, but I was disappointed in the movie version of the arena. The book made it a very scary place to be, while the movie made it look more like a disney ride."
4,I like it but not up to mark as hyped.,Movie was good. I liked it. But it was not up to mark as hyped when released. It could be much better.
4,Hunger Games,Although the book was far better the movie was pretty darn good. I'm looking forward to the next two movies.
2,One of the most over-rated films of all time,"I never understood all the hype behind this movie. It was ""Good"" at best. It was painfully slow in parts and the acting was muted. This movie was clearly meant to appeal to the Twilight crowd. As a thirtysomething, I guess I am too old for what amounts to a teen movie, despite a somewhat twisted plot. Thats all I wanted to say..."
4,"The movie is great, and the digital copy is a great bonus!","While no movie adaption of a book ever really meets my expectations, this is a good action/dystopian future movie in its own right. Lots of adventure, and a good story. This movie is definitely a bit gory, and I would not recommend it for anyone under 13 or so, but it could be a good family movie for families with older kids, it has interesting themes.It was very nice getting the digital copy. It is easy to access the video, and the quality was fabulous. I would highly recommend Amazon's video service."
5,best movie of all time,it was awesome!! so many twists in the movie you would always be wondering what was going to happen next. definetly recommend a must see!!
3,The Hunger Games,".Not enough detail in the beginning, if you hadn't read the book you miss a lot of the story. Otherpeople that watched the movie and didn't read the book thought the movie lackluster. TOO bad because all three books were great."
4,Quite Enjoyable,I really enjoyed this film. I had read the book first and as usual the book has more detail in just about every way.Making movies from good books is always hard but the movie touched on all important aspects of the book and was very exciting. I highly recommend this exciting movie.
3,The book was better,"Wish the movie had followed the book. Wonder if the other 2 books in the series will be made into moviesl if so, will they follow the books."
1,Damaged dvd,"After reading the trilogy, I was anxious to pre-order the dvd. I finally received the movie, early in fact, and couldn't wait to play it. Right in the middle, it stopped. I couldn't get it to move forward or backward. At one point it jumped to about 3/4 of the way through. I was so disappointed!I used the return print-out & sent it back. I was pleased with how amazon.com dealt with the whole transaction of immediately returning my payment, with no shipping cost."
3,Ultraviolet - NOPE Don't want anything to do with it,"First Movie was Awesome!!!! Book was Better but thats to be expected. 5 STARS For the MovieI'm wondering how long it will take the studios to figure it out, WE DON""T WANT UltraViolet 0 Stars for having this.Sales of Blue-Ray's are down because we (the consumers) REFUSE to by the them if they include UltraViolet.We want our options, in my case iTunes Digital Copy. It works on my old ipod, iphone, ipad and Apple TV.I can use it on a plane train or car. No Data Usage Required. No secondary App to play it.One Stop Shopping, thats' what we want.Oh one last thing Joe consumer, The studios are making extra money off you buying this when, you do not collect your UVVU Copy.Don't buy it, send a meesage to the studios."
1,Good Movie - 2 Defective DVD's,"I love this movie. I read the books and saw it in the theater twice so I was eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD. I pre-ordered and received my first DVD right away. I popped the DVD in just minutes after it was delivered. Once I began watching I realized that it completely skipped scene 15. So I returned it and received my replacement DVD the very next day. I decided to watch this one as well just to make sure it was good. It started off okay but only the first couple of minutes of scene 14 played then it skiped to scene 15. After that, I did not watch any further. Unsure if I'll try another replacement or just request a refund."
1,Ultra-Violet Digital Copy is GARBAGE!,"It's a complete shame that my girlfriend wanted this movie to watch at home, because if not for her I would have NEVER purchased this movie with this Ultra-Violet ""Digital Copy"" it's the worst thing EVER. It's not a true digital copy, it's a stream from a service that can revoke your videos at any time. What happened to the good old days of receiving an iTunes code and being able to play the video on ANY of my devices freely. Hollywood sucks."
2,stopped in the middle,I choose this rating cause the movie stopped in the middle of playing. Changed to another DVD movie still stopped at that point.
4,on the edge of your seat,The movie was great and has led me to want to read the book and can not wait until they make the next movie in the series. Great story line.
3,Hunger games,"It was an Movie. it was a bit slow in the beginning. not a lot of character development, but overall I enjoyed the movie."
1,Sick movie,"This is a very said movie and one that kids should not be seeing, what does it mean to have kids hunting and killing other kids? To me it's pretty sick and unbelibale that it's marketed to a young audience."
2,How many 16 year olds do you know with a receding hairline?,"I spend much of the movie thinking about how badly it was cast. Expressionless faces, ""old"" actors playing children, non believable portrayals. maybe donald sutherland was reasonably cast as Snow. I think some of the details might not make sense unless one had read the book, but I""m not sure since I was too distracted by the innappriate cast. What a dissapointing end to such a captivating book. (my instant video got messed up too and kept saying I had only 6 hours left even though I just purchased a 24 hour rental)."
2,As shallow as a fashion magazine,"I enjoyed the book, the movie was too pretty.Even though the inhabitants of impoverished district 12 look like WWII refugees and wear frumpy frocks, Katniss sports a to die for outfit -- well-fitted leather jacket plus those marvelous boots -- while hunting a deer. No way would she ever gut a deer in that outfit! This implausibility made me laugh out loud and took me out of the movie at the very beginning instead of gaining my interest. And the laughs just continued...Sorry guys, but I got tired of close-ups of Katniss. The irony is that this vain fashion magazine approach is contrary to the theme of the book. How did Hollywood not get it? (Sarcasm, folks.)The characters lack depth, the ending lacks closure, the scenes are mere snippets, the romance is cold, special effects border on cheesy, yet it's mildly entertaining. For some reason, I liked seeing W. Harrelson and L Kravitz in their roles."
3,Didn't live up to it's hunger hype! J. Law is stunning!,"I had huge hunger expectation for this film because of how well it did in theatres and the great reviews it got. After watching it tonight I was not impressed in any way and didn't like the ending. I felt like i could predict the whole thing except for a few minor rewrites. The best thing is that the acting is good and Jennifer Lawrence is stunning! SHe's very pretty.IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS FILM IS THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IN 2000 BY THE JAPANESE. IT'S CALLED BATTLE ROYALE. Battle royale is much bloodier, interesting, scary and entertaining. Hunger games in my opinion is just a watered down americanized version of battle royale.All in all this was just another ordinary mediorcre film. I hope the sequel is better! Don't like my review? Go watch battle royale and i bet you'd agree. Thanks and Godbless~shauns movie review"
2,"Not Battle Royale, by any means","Unfortunately the writer has many similarities the amazing work done in Japan. The material appears to be stolen although the author claims to have never heard of Battle Royale. The Hunger Games has a very hollow feel and seem it may have needed a bit more in the way of character development as you never really felt anything for them. I really wanted to like it, but it just never took off for me. Watchable but very boring overall."
3,Ok - book was better,"This movie was something I was not really sure how they were going to adapt to film from the book. They did an ok job but, I would say they missed the boat on identifying with the characters and Peeta was cast wrong. Not sure if Katniss was cast correctly either. Prim was not as small and innocent as she came across in the book. I do like the casting of Haymitch, Katniss' mother, Effie, President Snow, and Rue.Anyway, the movie was just ok. Could have been so much better."
3,"Not bad, but a lot of what made the book so good is lost",It was entertaining. The book was much better and a lot of what made the book so good was left out of the movie or simply couldn't be translated to film in a way that had the same impact as the book.
5,Great Movie!!!!,"A little slow at the beginning, but once the action starts, you don't want it to be over. Loved it!"
3,"Fast paced, but lacked details that made the book compelling","I thought it was a decetn attempt to portray the book, but there were many scenes left out which gave depth to the conflict of emotions felt by Katniss as she moves from survival to protection of Peeta. I suppose there is only so much time to tell the story, but I felt the action was choppy and did not move well from scene to scene"
5,Very dramatic and well done.,"In a futuristic world, much of the population of the U S. is divided up into zones, where they are each required to send two of their children to compete In a survival contest where only one survives. The contest is a reality show that is televised for all to see. The participants are manipulated by the people running the game in order to maximize entertainment value for the masses watching at home. This was a riveting and realistic movie that features young people fighting for their survival and the instincts of them to either be ruthless or cooperative dictate how they will behave during the games. The handheld camera work may be nausea inducing for some, but otherwise this is a terrific story of a bond developing and of the efforts of young people to survive."
5,loved,Great movie. Cannot wait to see the rest of them when they come out... nothing more to say about that.
3,not the hype,watchable but I found it quite stupid and not in a fun way maybe it appeals to younger people but lame to me
3,Not as great as the hype!,"I mean, it was a GOOD movie - but DEFINITELY not up to the hype that everyone was taking it as. Like WTH? I was let down actually. But overall, its a story line that has been stolen from a Japanese movie director who has done this already - so yeah. Interesting and twisted - definitely not a waste of time. Worth watching :)"
4,Book to Movie Successfully Accomplished,I went to see this movie in theaters with my 17 yr old daughter and we loved it . If she were to rate it she'd give it 5 stars . After seeing the movie my daughter asked me to read the book . I was surprised how well they adapted the movie for the screen . This movie/DVD will get multiple viewings in our household . My daughter is excited to watch the extras which we will do soon . Highly recommend this DVD for any fans of the book or anyone interested in a good movie to watch with children 12yrs or older .
5,Great Fun,"Straight to the point. I have been trying to get the books from my son to read them. He loans them out before I can get them. He told me the movie was very close to the book. The movie was filmed fairly close to home (the North Carolina side of the Smoky Mountains). A high school friend of mine cooked the pigs and bread used in the movie. OK. Plenty of reasons to see the movie.The story line and characters were very well done! I was not disappointed at all. Despite my connections with the movie, the movie is tons of fun. Great suspense and excitement and action. Everything is setup perfectly.I love this movie."
5,"the hunger games, purchased at amazon","the hunger games dvd was longly anticipated by my self. it did not disapoint me. i have read the entire hunger games trilogy, and at 73, I thorougly engoyed it!"
3,pretty disappointing,Really hated that several of the key parts from the book had been changed or totally left out....like where the mockingjay pin came from which was a very important part of the story.
5,Amazing,"Although some things were changed from the book, it was still a pretty great movie. It was a great way for us to visualize the world of The Hunger Games."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever filmed!,"I paid good money to watch this movie based upon the pre-hype of it. I left after 20 minutes into the showing. If you pay 19.99 or even 1.99 for this movie, you'll be screwed!"
1,Thanks Amazon???,"Well, it's been quite a while & I see that my digital copy of this movie is still in my video library. I misunderstood & believed I only had access to it for 24 hrs.I LOVE my digital copy. I love the deal I was given.I did have to wait 20 min after midnite to access the digital copy. But, I still have it today.I'm sorry I responded so quickly, in assuming the worst.Amazon has been great to me. I rent a lot of movies, buy movies & I don't know what I'd do w/out it!!!!"
1,Sad state of affairs,"I think it is a sad state of affairs when we enjoy entertainment like this. However, I can see the parallels to this movie and our life here on this earth. I know, I know, it is just a movie. But I do not care for this kind of entertainment. Sorry I rented it."
1,read the book instead,"Another case where the 'writers' of the movie have chopped up and bastardized the book to fit into their timeframe. Jennifer Lawrence is plain, dry, and boring. Josh Hutcherson is awful as Peeta, terrible casting choice there. The Capital people look like Willy Wonka on steroids and are so over the top they blow the feel of the movie.Do yourself a favor and read the book while avoiding this crap. Terrible movie, waste of money and time."
3,50 and over,"I don't think this was a great movie. But it was entertaining.I am older and have not read the books. The movie was fun to watch - sort of- some parts had me saying to myself ""really?""."
4,The Hunger Games,It was a lot more interesting than I expected. Someone has a very good imagination. I would like to have a little more to the ending. Am I alone or did I have to use my imagination?
4,Inspiring,I liked the movie. It was very entertaining . Survival of the fittest in a manner of speaking. Expressed emotion which reached the heart at certain points of the movie.
5,Great movie,"I never got to go watch The Hunger Games in the movie theatre. When it came out on DVD, I bought it immediately and was not disappointed. I loved it! It wasn't as gruesome as I thought it was going to be (good thing). I'll be watching it again soon!"
5,The Hunger Games,If you read the book then the movie is easier to follow. Having said that you will fall in love with the lead characters anyway.I do not recommend for children under 18.
4,Good movie,"Definitely a dvd to add to the collection...This movie was well acted, well done and one of the few that does the book justice"
4,Pretty decent for a YA movie,"Watched this last night, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Still, it's not a five star movie for me. I thought the characters could have been fleshed out a little more. I am a little confused as to how these games control the population, or why the districts rebelled in the first place, etc, but maybe it spells it out in the book? YA isn't usually my thing, but I might have to go read these ones. :)"
5,Best Book-to-Film Interpretation Yet!,"When I read The Hunger Games, I wondered if there would be a movie. The movie represents the spirit and intent of the novel right down to the claustrophobic hand-camera shooting style. You can taste the terror of young Katniss. The tension between each character interaction is palpable. A fantastic movie of life and death, love and survival, self determinism and blind allegiance! If you haven't read the books, you will still enjoy every deliciously layered plot twist."
4,Good Movie,"I am collecting movies with Jennifer in it. But this movie itself is good, if not excellent or as I hope for. But this movie is when Jennifer get off to a best start or get more known to everyone."
4,Good movie,"Good movie, I enjoyed it but I won't probably be watching the rest of the series when it comes out. I find the topic a tad disturbing."
3,Pretty good movie,"Let me first start off by saying that the streaming service was excellent and would give it 5 stars. The rating and the rest of the review concern the movie itself.The Hunger Games is about a girl, Katniss, in an impoverished 19th century style community. Then when her sister is chosen to take part in the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is taken to the Capital City which is a futuristic city where the Hunger Games take place. The rest of the movie is about her survival in the games.I have to admit that I was at first skeptical about this movie, but the sudden twist by changing the scenery from an impoverished luddite community to a futuristic and eccentric society sold me on it. Overall the movie wasn't anything truly special to me, but it was still a movie I enjoyed watching. I don't have any intention of watching it again, but if you haven't seen this yet and nothing better to do, then I recommend at least trying this movie."
3,Poor acting,I was not expecting much and I was right. Their was no passion. The book is about hunger and the actors didn't look famished.
3,Degital Copy,"Degital Copy I was not able to upload to my Itunes , The redeem page keep on gives me error"
3,"Basically, it's the book","Follows true to the book, but without the detail, the background, or the depth of story. Like most book adaptations, fell short, but one of the better attempts."
1,Flawed DVD,"Very dissatisfied with the quality of the DVD. The entire middle section paused every 30 seconds or so. The only way to get it moving again was hit Play, Pause, Play"
1,terrible,not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not good! please dont watch it! actors terrible writting terrble script trrbl i cant even spell or write about how bad this movie is! lol but i mean it!!!!1
1,Awful!,"The acting was stiff and forced, so was the entire choreography and graphics of the nature and Panem, as well as the depiction of the Capitol people. The fight scenes were blurry as was the point of view that made me dizzy just watching. With the computerized world we live in, I felt like I was watching a movie filmed 10 (or more) years ago. Just watch Avatar, and you'll know how badly Hunger Games did on the graphics part and flow of the movie. I have never been this disappointed in a movie adaptation before. It felt like it was low budget."
1,Boring,This movie is one of the most boring movies I have seen since the Twilight series. This is a total waste of time.
1,Horrible Copies of this Movie,I ordered this DVD twice because when I first got the DVD it froze at one part then it skipped 10 minutes. I ordered another one and it did the EXACT same thing. Needless to say I will not be purchasing from Amazing for DVDs again.
1,Poor Service,Overal I enjoyed the Hunger Games movie. It was a great movie and was enjoyable to watch with my girl friend. Unfortunately I pre-ordered the movie three months in advance to receive it the day it came out. It took an extra four days to ship and rather than it being delivered to my apartment I had to go pick it up myself from the post office about 30 minutes away. Before that though when I called Amazon to see why it wasnt dropped off or taking so long the operator pretty much told me too bad call the post office not our problem. This is why ebay is considered a better site in my opinion.
1,horrible,"halfway through the movie it was skipping, pausing and wouldn't play. i am actually trying to find out how to return this. if anyone knows how, please help!"
2,Highly over-rated . Only good for ardent fans.,"Boring, predictable, derivative. Definitely Fi but little Sci! Can't believe there will be a sequel(s). May be worth watching on a plane if it's free and you have trouble sleeping. Probably cheaper than Ambien though!"
2,whats all the fuss about this movie?,I rented this because the movie created such a hype but I thought it was just a very average and predictable story. Not really worth the money. Jennifer Lawrence is good though..
2,Too much hype,Ok movie...too much hype on advertising. The plot was ok but not that well done. If there is a part two we will pass.
2,A great story ruined by stupid photography,"The epic struggle between ""The Capitol"" and ""The Districts"" is matched only by the struggle to see what is happening in the story because the camera is incessantly zoomed in too close, jiggled, pointed off-center, etc., until it is simply TEDIOUS to watch. If the same morons run the cameras in follow-on movies, they will not be worth watching."
2,Disappointed,"I felt very let down by the movie, was a huge fan of the books. I expected the movie not to fall in line with the book as they normally don't, but it gave no time to build up compassion or interest in any of the characters. I felt it left out anything of worth about the actual story."
3,UltraViolet code is invalid right out of the package!!!!!!,"I purchase all of my DVDs and Blu-rays with UltraViolet so that I can watch videos from my TV or computers when on the road without taking all the discs. When I opened this package to enter the code, it came up invalid. That really irritates me. I am hoping that someone from Amazon can assist me.Update:08/20/2012 - Amazon contacted me regarding my review. They are sending out a new copy with 2-day delivery. Very good work, Amazon!Update: 09/06/2012 - Received new movie with valid code. Watched movie and loved it. Better than I expected from the reviews. I cannot wait until the next one. Love Jennifer Lawrence."
4,Nicely surprised.,I'm in my 60's and thought: 'no way' but am glad I was the gazzilionth person to watch. Good story nicely done.
1,"So.... this was one of the ""best"" movies of the year?? Really??","Ok I'm going to review this movie as a movie and not a book, for you fanboys of the book I'm talking to you. A good book doesn't equate to a good movie and this one is a classic example of that. I'm seeing a lot of 5 star reviews of this movie which after watching it and reading some of your reviews makes me seriously question whether you're giving those reviews for the book or the actual movie.The cinematography was crap, the chick that played the Katniss character was ok, other than that the acting was pretty terrible, the direction was garbage, the storyline is flat, plots are uninteresting and the characters are incredibly boring. The romance was very cheesy.On a personal note I almost fell asleep twice, no movie has done that to me since I watched Eragon lol."
1,The Hunger Games,"This movie was flat out BORING! It dragged on for far too long before the action began, which was also BORING, but somewhat less so. Some people, including myself, would see this boring too long beginning as time used to develop characters in the movie. It succeeded in doing so for the main character, whatever her name is. As for the rest of the characters, it did a poor job.I don't want to characterize this as a bad movie, it wasn't. It was just BORING!"
3,Rented but never got a chance to watch,Ive never seen this movie but according to the rest of the world it was suppose to be pretty good. If I ever see it I will give a full review on it.
1,Digital Security Sucks,"Have not watched movie yet, but digital security did not allow my daughter to play on laptop while we where traveling. Very frustrating and disappointing!!!!! Seems to work fine now that we are home and have internet connection, but still frustrating as would have been nice to watch while traveling. Where we were staying had slow internet, so could not digital copy until got home."
3,Damning with faint praise,"It was OK. Another post-apocalyptic thriller with minute revisions of the same old theme: Roman bread and circuses to calm the hordes, good poor folk, bad rich men. Reminded me of the TV show ""Lost"" except no fat guy. The girl, however, shot a mean arrow."
3,enh,"This movie didn't really connect with me, it was alright and entertaining but I would of rathered watching something dubbed with a cheesy plot."
3,The Hunger Games,"The cast was appealing and the story was somewhat true to the book. Some of the important visuals, like the fabulous costumes, were poorly translated to the screen and much was lost in a pg13 rating."
3,Hungry For More,"I was disappointed in this movie. I have not read the book (generally I prefer to see the movie before reading the book--it almost ALWAYS disappoints if reversed)so approached it solely as a movie. It does not seem to stand on it's own. While Jennifer Lawrence was compelling to watch, and Stanley Tucci did his usual excellent job, I felt there was something lacking. The movie dragged in parts (on the train, for example) and moved too quickly in others ( the actual game.) There was not enough character development--I couldn't really bring myself to invest in what happened to these people. For example, I didn't get why Katniss cared about Rue so much. She made very brief appearances before their big scene.Overall OK--but doesn't motivate me to want to read the book. It's certainly no ""Harry Potter."""
5,I can't wait for the next!,I love this movie! Jennifer Lawrence is wounderful as Katniss Everdeen. I'm looking forward to seeing the next movie when it comes out.
4,Mostly followed the book,"I thought the movie mostly followed the storyline. I am usually not impressed with film adaptations of books but I thought this one was pretty well done. The graphics were terrific and the action was non-stop. Of course, having read the book, the story was easier to follow than for those who jumped straight into watching the movie first. I can't wait to see Catching Fire and Mockingjay."
4,Well Done Adaptation,This movie is a decent adaptation of the book. The characters were well cast and the actors did a great job bringing them to life. I can't wait to see Catching Fire!
1,Horrible movie.,"Don't even waist your time, it's a teenager-ONLY movie. Very cheesy romance, weak story and bad actors. If you want to see a good movie, rent the real one Battle Royale."
2,"Moving a camara around real fast, does not make an action movie","Moving a camara around real fast, does not make an action movie. And rigging the end results of the fight, along with changing the rules to suit the needs of the people who are running this F-up movie about forcing kids to kill one anouther, (arn't the kids messed up in the head enough already) for the poeple who made this movie for kidsAll in all this is a really stupid movieWISH I WOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY FOR A REALLY GOOD MOVIEBECAUSE THIS IS NOT ITand if this is a reflection of are future socity,WHERE SCREWEDALSO THIS MOVIE IS IN THE 1.85 ASPECT RATIO, not 1,27 like the Amazon ad says, and not 2.40 like the cover saidthe people who did not do their homework, must be relitives of someone at the movie company"
2,Take away the hype...,"...and you've got a classic B movie here. Think ""Running Man"" meets ""Twilight"". A terrible screenplay and huge plot holes. Just one example: ""Half of you will die from cold, thirst and hunger!"". Really? (not one actually faced real cold, thirst or hunger). This movie is not dramatic enough to move you and not campy enough to make you smile. Two stars for effort....barely."
2,I can't believe this movie ever made it to the big screens!,"First, concept is very stupid where kids are killing each other and society enjoys watching it. Second, it was a very boring movie! I was hoping that maybe the next 10 minutes will be a little more exciting, unfortunately that did not happen. I'm mad at myself waisting 142 minutes of my time watching this!"
4,"Book's better, but not bad.","Although the book was better, they did a good job with the movie. I'm always disappointed when they change something in the movie from the way it happened in the book though, and this movie was no exception. They mostly followed the story, but did alter some things (with less overall impact on the story, I assume), which makes the book better. Special effects were really good, too. Overall, a pretty good job."
4,Truth in Advertising,"Having read the trilogy of books before seeing Hunger Games, I had high hopes and personal concepts for the visual representation. This is always a precarious place to be, fraught with the danger of disappointment. I really fully enjoyed the movie and thought that necessary distillations of various scenes for the sake of time were well handled. The futility the population outside the city feels is nicely captured by the lighting and muted color used; and then the change of texture and sensation upon arrival in the Capitol is a glaring juxtaposition. The excesses of wealth and hardness alluding to those of ancient Rome can't be missed. Overall this movie sets up the sequels very solidly, and I look forward to seeing them."
5,Good Movie,"If you liked the books, you won't be disappointed by the movie. They did a good job of staying true to the books message and plot line. Definitely recommend it for any fan."
4,N,I do enjoy this movie but as always it was not as good as the book. It seemed like they skipped a lot of stuff. I thought I should rewind to see if I missed things. Seems to me that is you hadn't read the book you wouldn't get as much out of the movie.
2,Subtitles.....when will Amazon have subtitles?,Purchased the DVD and enjoyed the movie very much. Did not watch it on Amazon because there were not subtitles.
3,The book is better...,"As with most movies based on a book, the book is greatly better. In this movie things were dramatically different than the book. Things were left out. If you haven't read the book this movies will be good."
4,Just wish it would match the books,"We have watched this 3 times now.One with one set of neighbors and then another set after we watched it upon initial purchase.My wife read the books after watching vs I'd already read them to see what all the kids were talking about during classes at church.From my wife's perspective a very entertaining movie with a good back story til the end. She didn't seem to think or feel a sequence made sense. having read the books, the movie left out some key parts and references missed key interactions of being outside the wire hunting why it makes sense during the Games.an entertaining movie, not as good as the book, but few are. we are looking forward to another neighborhood movie night when the sequel(s) come out.digital copy is decent copy and allows me to show others on the plane during travels."
5,"Yay, filmmakers - yay, Hollywood!",One of the best movies Iâ€™ve seen in a long time. Excellent characters and actors who portray them. I love the concept. Thatâ€™s what Hollywood needs to keep doingâ€¦ giving us fresh ideas. Canâ€™t wait for the next one!!!!
4,One worth buying,"In this day and age of streaming movies and Redbox we have all but stopped buying movies. This one is a particular favorite of my childrens, so, I thought it would be nice to have a copy at home. They like and Dad is a heroe..........for 5 minutes. Still worth it!"
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"The movie was enjoyable, but slow to build. As hyped up as it was, I guess I expected more. 3 Stars"
2,The Hunger Games,"This was a very interesting movie. The concept is frightening, to think this may come to be. Movies have a way of predicting the future. I did have a problem with Children killing Children not only used to punish communities for their uprising against corrupt governance and to keep any future uprising suppressed but used for entertainment for the ""good, compliant people"". Disturbing."
2,"""Lottery"" movie knockoff","A very ""cheap"" expensive production of a movie we had to watch in 6th grade called ""The Lottery"". It was about a community of people that started involving people, to increase their prosperity, putting their names in a ""hat"" to be drawn to determine who's to die for the others. A little more action in ""Hunger Games"" though, and definitely more ""hyped"". Very disappointing considering the hype this flick got in the media, and certainly the number of copies I see on the discount rack in Safeway. (Very well charged with SFX for a 2 hour 22 minute flick...oooooh!) I did like it for the fact that it WAS over 2 hours long. Not too many shows out there that can make that claim. You should watch it; it's a great way to waste 2 and a half hours! Frankly, I am truly amazed at seeing how ""great"" other reviewers rated this movie. Maybe they liked the length of the movie too. Definitely NOT a ""Great Movie""! I've seen ""greater"" in the discount racks at Walmart!!"
4,Hunger Games,"Hunger Games was rendered well in this video translation of the book. True to most renderings of this sort (i.e., book to film), there were details omitted that fans would like to see, but, altogether, it was an enjoyable movie."
4,Hunger Games Blu-Ray Version,"Great movie. Have never read any of the books and that probably would have helped understand the whole premise and reason for the districts, since the movie never really went into the background of the why's and wherefore's of the plot.Great special effects and clarity in Blu-Ray version.Have finally switched to buying more and more Blu-Ray that DVD versions of movies.Will get the next installment of the Hunger Games if it ever comes out..."
5,hg,great moviesaw it at the movies and that is why i bought it and i love it and can't wait for the next one
3,Not Too Bad I Guess,"The movie wasn't bad. I wish it could have been more like the book. Not to say, the movie didn't get the main points across, it just seemed it was missing too much of the book. It seemed the movie was fast forwarded. I realize that a movie is 1-2 hours and only so much can come from a book that takes all day to read. But a few more scenes about Katnis' true love, a little more about her sister, a little more about the fights in the arena, a little more of what led up to the Captitol taking over the Hunger Games would have been good. I guess if one did not read the book first, then the movie, I am sure, would have been better."
3,Pleasant little tween movie,"The long-awaited (by some, not me) screen adaptation of the first novel in the 'Hunger Games' trilogy was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Plot and character development sometimes played second fiddle to the heavy-handed anti-establishment theme that undoubtedly made it so appealing to its intended audience. Other than the two tribute characters from district 12 and their drunken mentor, the other characters were puppets populating a wooden vista against which the drama played out. I wasn't expecting a lot, so the visual affects were a very pleasant surprise. Tarantino doesn't have to worry about being replaced in the action-adventure genre by Gary Ross, but his action sequences were 'OK'. I know this is a tepid review, but there wasn't much to get excited about. If you have a couple of hours to spare, by all means stream it, but I wouldn't watch it again so I wouldn't purchase the DVD."
4,Pretty good,Overall a very entertaining movie. A little disappointing if you've read the book but good never the less a good movie.
5,Great movie!,I wasn't sure I was going to like it but I DID! I really don't want to write about the movie...watch it and find out for yourself. I don't want to ruin it for anyone.
5,yea,This movie was slow getting into for me but really enjoyed it once it got going. Will watch it many more times.
4,The Hunger Games,I was curious about this book seriesand all the hype surrounding the movie. I purchased The Hunger Games and was pleasantly surpried and quite impressed with it.It was interesting and easy to read. I was glad I read all three books in this series before I watched the movie.
4,Very good!,One of the most entertaining movies I have seen within the past year. Excited for the second movie in the series.
2,A little disappointing,After reading the books I was looking forward to seeing the movie. I was disappointed. I didn't like the casting of the movie specifically Catniss. There was also a lack of character development and story line. The movie was just to rushed. I know it would be hard to get everything in the movie that was in the book but dam. I will no be seeing the sequel or at least I will not pay to see the sequel.
4,The Hunger Games,I am sure it would get 5 stars if I had not read all three books first... Watch the movie before you read the books.First Person: Combat PTSD
5,Very Satisfied,I bought this CD for my family to enjoy this Christmas. It also came with a digital copy. It is a great movie that follows the book pretty close. Thumbs up for the movie and the transaction
3,ok,The book was fantastic. The movie was more action than plot. But still a good movie. Read the books-- they were fantastic.
4,Christmas Gift,"Ordered early for a Christmas gift for my grandson....it arrived on time, and Christmas was a success. Always good to order early."
5,Good!,Clarity and sound is good and the overall movie quality is good too. Doesn't stop as some videos do to buffer.
1,This movie was weak! all hype no substance!,"Interesting storyline and plot. The wardrobe and sets are ok. This is good quality entertainment to fill your time, but not as bloody or gory as led to believe. This movie actually is very weird and kind of dry and almost boring. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography, and (A+) CGI effects. But overall, this movie is weak; I would never watch it again. Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks."
2,Warning about The Hunger Games DVD,"Preordered the DVD before it was release and received my copy Monday, sadly the DVD freezes at Scene 14 (1:13:00) only to resume 5-10 minutes later. Returned and received a new copy yesterday only to have the same issue after trying to see it in 2 laptops and 2 DVD players."
4,Hunger Games,The movie was interesting and the story was very good. We did receive the DVD on the release day which was nice.
5,"Hunger games, Great Movie, high Replay Value","I've watched the movie a few times now, and every time, it still brings the same feelings. For me, that is what sets a good movie apart from a bad one, a good movie will make the viewer feel emotions about the movie. All the gut-wrenching feelings that occurs within the viewer while the Hunger Games is absolutely intentional. it is a very dark movie, not the greatest for kids, but worth it. This is one of those movies with a high replay value, as in every time you watch it, it is still just as good as the first. I also like the fact that it explains what the book doesn't, while it doesn't rely on the book either. A must see, and a good purchase."
4,Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games is a good addition to a book series collection. I myself have yet to read the books, but after seeing the movie, I've moved it further up my books to read list."
3,Very disappointed,"This movie was very disappointing. It was slow moving and dull. We kept waiting for more action and a better story line. Others saw it and thought it was good, but no one said it was great. I would not recommend it."
5,great movie,I really liked those movie. It has a good plot and follows the book well. It will leave you wanting the sequel.
4,Great movie,This is a very good adventure movie. I gave it four stars because the tempo the movie kept. Events either occurred too quickly or too slowly. Other than that the actors were amazing in the roles and the director did great in representing the book.If you didn't read the book you may be slightly lost on some of the movie. It watch it twice an you should get a good feel for it.This is a movie you must see.
4,The Hunger Games,"It is a good movie, produced well. I must say the book was alot better though. Just felt the movie was lacking some content the book had."
3,Sending Teens off to kill each other as a National past time - really?,It was hard to get too into this storyline because it was so unlikely a concept. I had the same problem with the book and didn't finish it. I like Jennifer Lawrence and she and some other cast members make it worth watching.
5,Hunger Games,I read the book and wanted to see the movie. I thought they did a really good job on the movie. It was really good!
5,Haunting yet an eye opener,"The Hunger games made me think of what is happening today in our nation as our so called Government demands more from The People such as give-backs and high taxes while they- the rich- take and Lord it over us. The movie made me think that this could be our future if we don't stand up and demand back our Republic-Government of the people, by the people, for the people."
4,Well done,"This felt like Twilight to me. When I saw the Twilight movie, it was okay, but it made me want to read the book.Hunger games was about the same. Well done, but lacking the depth that a book might deliver.It may just be me, but it felt like the camera was bouncy. At the beginning of the movie the way everything moved felt fast and unnatural and made me a little dizzy. I tried adjusting settings on my tv, but I didn't notice a difference and I eventually adjusted to it."
5,The Hunger Games [HD],Great movie adaptation of the first book in Suzanne Collins' best selling trilogy. With a cast of little know actors supported by some older well established hollywood greats the story moves along at a rapid pace. Unfortunately not all of the book's undercurrents can be crammed into a movie. That being said I would recommend that anyone who watches the movie also reads the book. The book is a fantastic read!
3,"It was OK, not up to the hype","I think what this movie really lacked was action. The fight scenes were so-so. Didn't live up to the hype, but perhaps without the hype I would have had less expectation.Also the movie left a lot unexplained. I never read the book, but watched with someone who had, they were able to explain much that wasn't."
3,Read the book (but only the first book). Don't bother with the movie.,"You will probably be disappointed with this adaptation. The performances are flat, the design is unimaginative (especially of the capital and it's citizens) and casting is very hit-and-miss. Woody Harrelson phones in a completely off target performance as Haymitch, who was one of the most interesting characters in the book.If you haven't read the book, go there first. However I don't recommend the sequels, as they are disappointing."
3,The Hunger Games,"it wasn't one of our favorite movies,butit did get better as it went along. We hope the next one will be better."
3,Not as thrilling as advertized,"I was really anticipating this movie, a lot of my friends had read the book, so I thought I was in for a really interesting show. It was slow, it was mostly disgusting and it had a really un-interesting ending. Perhaps this should have all just stayed a book."
3,OK,The movie was ok. There was alot of details missing from the book. I hope the second movie is much better.
5,excelente pelicula,"muy buena pelicula, es muy apegada al libro , excelentes actuaciones , real y autentica.y esperando la proxima... en llamas , para comprarla ..."
5,Love it,"I never tire of watching this movie. Acting is really good, story is rich and interesting, I actually like this movie more than the book which is a rarity. Well worth the watch, can't wait for the next one to come out."
2,Disappointing despite hype,I found this movie to be boring. Actors seemed to be walking thru the movie without expressing much emotion. The costumes were nice which was about the best thing with this movie. The movie did not follow the book. I am glad that I chose to rent this movie rather than purchase.
2,Hunger games,Children's killing children. I really don't understand how something like this can be so popular. I guess it's just a sign of our times.
2,The hunger Games,"Never read the book .... weird and sick movie and story line strangely with echos of George Orwell, 1984. I enjoy watching movies again & again over the years but I Probably will never watch this again. Should have rented it at Red Box instead of buying it."
2,hackey,"just another female boasting masculine abilities. not realistic in its dealing with conflict, to much ""agonizing"". so-so acting grade. hope no sequel."
3,Pretty good movie,"Most of the movie is fair, but it gets good at the end when the boy and girl (can't remember their names now) decide that they won't take the route where they'll only be one winner (one left to live) and decide that they both will die. Anyway, the committee decided that both would be the winners."
2,Digital Copy doesn't work,Loved the movie. DVD works ok. A couple of little skips here or there. My biggest complaint is that this says it comes with a ultraviolet digital copy. I tried to download the movie in itunes using the code and then through the other way. Neither worked. I have no idea who to contact to find out what the deal is with it either. Annoying.
4,"Great movie, not great response time.",This movie is exceptional. What is not exceptional was how long it took me to recieve it. It took over a week from the time it was released to get to me. In the past when preordering movies I have either received them the day they are released or two to three days later.
4,Interesting,"Enjoyed this movie. It is different than others, but could be upsetting to younger children. Five more words required and written."
3,"So-so, falls short of book","If you did not read the book you will probably love this movie, if you did - be warned that this movie was pretty much a disappointment. I guess I find that to be true with most movies, when I have read the book beforehand then the movie fails. I just get so frustrated when they change the story line for no apparent reason. It was just ok, wouldn't watch it again."
4,Flick vs. Book,"I enjoyed both the book and the flick. I thought the book was more entertaining and informative. The author described the scenes vividly and included much more information about the characters. However, if the flick included all the author portrayed it would have been much longer or would have necessitated two films for one book."
4,Not what I expected,"Great movie, I was hesitant to watch this one. But I was nicely surprised, I have not read the books and can't wait for the next one to come out. Worth watching."
5,So much more than a kids' movie!!!,"Rented the film through Amazon steaming video to watch with my kids. They had read the books, but I hadn't. I absolutely loved the movie as did my kids. Often when we see a film based on a book they have read, they are disappointed. Not this time. I'm inspired to read the books before the next two movies come out."
4,The Hunger Games,"Watched the movie three times but I didn't read the book so I can't draw any comparisons there. The plot is a bit disturbing but not overly graphic. Probably not a movie for those who can't deal with a somewhat depressing theme. When the movie's over, it makes you glad you don't live in that world. Very good movie!"
4,Good Movie,"I liked the movie, but the book was far better because you knew so much more about the background of what was happening that was omitted in the movie. Still, it was a good watch."
5,Great movie!,You really 'feel for' the characters as they go through their trials.This isn't as bloody-violent as I imagined when I heard what it was about...but does have killings in it. Not for little children.
5,Great Movie,"Other than the 3 freezes we experienced with the streaming, great movie. *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***"
5,Great movie to add to any collection.,"This followed the book exactly, this doesn't always happen when the screenplay is prepared. Looking forward to the next two movies."
4,Great Movie-- Maybe Not The Best Adaptation,"I read the books before I saw the movie, so I knew what was going on... but I think it might be confusing for anyone who hasn't had that perspective into Katniss's head. I did feel like there were some key scenes missing, but overall the feeling of the book was captured pretty well. I bought it because I will definitely watch it again, but as usual the book was a LOT better."
5,Great,"I purchase a relative few movies for my library. But this is one from when I first saw it, I new I would have to own it. This was an excellent movie, and the Blu-ray only enhanced it. I am sure I will be purchasing the rest of the series when they are released."
4,Book was better,"Good movie, but as usual the book was better, they left a lot of key parts out. I guess the strict movie watchers will get the jist of the series by watching it ;)"
5,"exciting, suspensful",i saw this in the movies whem it first came cameI ordered it as soon as it was put on advance Amazon dvdI haven'tbeen dissapointed each time I watch it is just as good as the first timeThe character acting is great
4,Hunger Games,"Loved the movie. Very good character representations, though Gale was a bit stiff. Loved the book even more, but that's normal. Can't wait til the next movie hits the theaters."
1,"This movie is for kids, don't believe the reviews","We are in the middle of a huge teen population boom in America right now so media companies are all producing teen oriented movies, TV, music, kinda like the 1950's baby boom. Unfortunately because of this boom we are subjected to one insipid re-worked re-booted teen movie after another. Example - This generation thinks ""American pie"" is a classic. The Hunger games is one of those movies. Honestly the first book was just O.K.. The second and third books are just horribly bad. (And are currently being made into movies as well)But hey, if you love Twilight/ Selena Gomez, Justin Beiber, Lagy Gag-ga, MTV, Micheal Bay, boy bands, reality TV and everything else this generation produces you will love the hunger games... a lot."
1,horrible jerky camera,"Extremely weak adaptation of a mediocre book. They made a stupid chick-flick out of a halfway decent action-drama. Like we needed another effing Twilight... :/ Horrible, horrible camera work and poor editing. The starving heroine of the book is played by a fat-head chick. Bad, cheezy acting. The CGI of the ""Capitol"" was lame. Only the interior design of the train and their suite was decent. It's kinda said because the book did have some potential."
3,You people (KIDs)DING),"Don't worry! As soon as you all mature and grow up - this movie will fade to black.Really exciting movie with a real twist. Teenagers killing each other for food.Punishment by the meanie ""NWO"".An epic movie would be Gladiator, Open Range, WaterworldYawn."
1,Mrs Joyce Whitt,I think this is a mistake. I have never purchased the Hunger Games. I dont have it in my home.
1,Proof that more is not more.,"Simply put, this fad (and yes it is a fad) is full of holes, teen angst/drama, and ignores the opportunities avaliable to it to make it a great premis."
1,false aspect ratio,"I know it isnt out yet, but when this is correct , i dont buy this version of the movie, because in the cinemasthe aspect ratio is 2:35:1 and on the blu ray they switched it to 1:85:1. I hate that !!!!!!!"
3,JES Hunger Games Reveiw,"Interesting, but didn't care for young folks attacking each other. Otherwise, it was entertaining. It's worth watching at least once."
5,mostly disappointed,"I read the book first and couldn't put it down so I was excited to watch the movie. But it was nowhere near as interesting or intense as the book. The characters in the movie aren't really built up and much of the significance of certain events isn't relayed. I highly recommend the book over the film. However, Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job as katniss."
5,Better than the book,"This is one time that the movie was better than the book. However, the storyline followed the book very closely but it was exciting to actually see the actor's costumes and the scenery. The actors were superb."
5,Amazing Movie!!,"This is a must watch movie, especially if you like the books. This movie has such a great premise, you get caught up in the world and will obsess over it for a long time. They picked a perfect cast for this movie to, everyone does an amazing job. I would definitely recommend this movie."
5,Outstanding movie,Amazing DVD for cheap! Also comes with ultraviolet copy and has a digital copy to take where ever! And there's also an amazing surprise that comes with your purchase!
2,Book is better,I am a huge fan of the books! I read them all within a week and was so sad that I actually read them so quick. So when the movie came out I was one of the first to be at the movie theatre. I was disappointed with how they portrayed some things. I felt that they did not do the book justice. Now my husband who did not read the books really loved the movie. So that might be helpful for you to know...I will still go and see the next one when it comes out because I am just curious to see what they do with it.
2,I'm not a fan.,"I'm generally not a fan of the whole post apocalypse genre, but I tried reading this one in order to discuss it with my son. Unfortunately, I found the style of writing very choppy and uncomfortable to read.I well aware that The Hunger Games is a very popular book, it's just that it's not for me."
1,Oh dear! How sad!,"I heard that Hunger Games had great potential. It may have, but it never clicked. It was slow, unintersting and reminiscent of the poor quality after school specials of the 80's.Spoiler Alert:The final ""moral of the story"" - If you're willing to sell out yourself and everything you believe in, you'll be rich and famous. SAD!!!"
1,Dissatisfied,"I ordered this DVD as it was advertised as a two disc DVD, it was not. I received a e-mail after the fact that the product was not as described. The product had already been sent before I could respond to the e-mail not to send it. Unfortunately, the DVD was sent and it was some theatrical version something that no one would want. This product was falsely advertised and I will be sending this product back. Truly dissatisfied."
4,Hunger Games Rental,I won't review the movie as rotten tomatoes and imdb do a good job at that. Sound and video quality were very good.
3,Okay,It was entertaining but disturbing. People hunting each other for someone's entertainment. Not a fare that I would enjoy. Would have enjoyed this movie more if the hunters would have turned on those individuals who were seeking the entertainment.
3,okay,"Nothing special here, I didn't read the book but this story has already been told many times before. Not very original."
3,The book is better.,"The main character did an amazing job portraying katniss. Actually all of the characters were very very good. I just feel like if you just watch the movie without reading the book first you miss out on a lot of meaning and thoughts, things that I thought were important in the story. The movie was good visually but personally I think that the movie should've been in first person like the book, with a VoiceOver so we could hear katniss's thoughts."
1,The Hunger Games,"Terrible acting. A ridiculous story. Unlike other fantasy stories, (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc), I could not suspend disbelief and found myself constantly asking questions about what kind of society would do this. Based on the books massive popularity, (no I have not read the books), I think I am just missing something here"
1,Hunger Games,I am unable to watch Hunger Games because you consistently send me the wrong region code . My region code is B as i say on my orders but you continue to send Region A.
5,Best Review Ever,"I love the concept, the characters, and the plot. I enjoyed reading the novels and watching the film. That having been said, EVERYTHING is subjective. My advice ? See the film and judge for yourself. Yep, that's it."
4,good movie but should not be compared to the books,"This was a great action packed film, I would not recommend watching this film if you are under age of 12 without adult supervision. It is a very creative movie but some topics could be sensitive to people of younger ages (Child Gladiatorial Combat). This film was made after the Hunger Games Trilogy and follows the story closely but leaves some important detail out, it would also be a spoiler if you have not read the second book. Over all I liked the movie and recommend you watch it but just keep a open mind."
3,"Good Movie, but not as awesome as the book","I saw the movie with my son which in itself was enjoyable and read the books at his suggestion. I had just finished the book when I saw the movie, so it was very fresh in my mind. I was very involved in the book and felt great sympathy for the character so it was enjoyable to see her come to life in the movie. The actress did a good job of portraying her,but as are other Hunger Games fans, I am ready for the sequel, Catching Fire and the finale The Mocking Jay. It just stopped in the middle as all trilogies do. I loved the movie, but as usual, I enjoyed the books more."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I wasn't excited this was going to be made into a movie, but I wasn't surprised. I read the books a few years ago, and enjoyed the first two. However, I was convinced to see it. I was worried it would get the Twilight treatment, reducing it to nothing more than teenage fluff. However, maybe because I expected so little amid the hype, I was impressed. It is quite faithful to the books, and does a good job of translating the action of the arena into a PG-13 movie. I don't really enjoy Elizabeth Banks as Effie or Donald Sutherland as President Snow, but most of the other casting choices worked well. Also, the movie doesn't spend much time (hardly any really) providing information about the different districts, which is a great part of the book. But, it stays parallel to the book otherwise. Most people who haven't read the books may not like it, but it is about time fans who read have their own special movie."
3,EH,"After obsessively reading the book one weekend I NEEDED to see the movie. I don't know why I was surprised when the movie fell short, as is often the case with book to screen interpretations. The streaming was a little rocky, pixeling out during fast action sequences. BUT, it was available for instant play and at 10 dollars cheaper than buying it via itune/appleTV, so I appreciate the instant gratification none the less, let alone a more appealing $$."
1,Very disappointed!!!,"I ordered the HD ""Hunger Games"" video and viewed the show on my wireless ROKU.When the video was downloaded it told me it could not be viewed in HD. Since there were twoprices HD and non-HD why was I charged for HD if I did not get it. I know it was only $1but I think that is a false programing and I will not be using this service again."
2,"Overrated, Overhyped","I finally saw this movie on DVD, I never got a chance to see it in the theatre and I am so glad I did not. Every so often you get a movie that is big it and has great overall reviews and I can't understand why, this film is one of them. It had a weak plot, it could have been a TV movie. Also, when movie ends and the heros win the ""hunger games"" nothing happens like an attempt to over throw the evil goverment that is forcing these kids to enter this cruel games."
1,It sucks,I think Hollywood doesn't get it. This is a terrible Movie!!!!!I think the old movies are much better than this new Hollywood
5,Absolute Must See! Excellent!,"Catniss is the heroine of the 21st Century. The movie follows the book very closely and is non-stop action. Really, must see, adults and youg adults as well. Enjoy!"
3,Read the book. Movie was fine,Enjoyed watching this movie. I read the book and was looking forward to the movie. I am looking forward to seeing the other ones.
3,The Hunger Games,It was a little disappointing for me. This was so dramatically a cut version of a book that book was so vividly painted a story.
1,My Kindle wouldn't download it,Think I would have loved this as I loved the books but tried many times in the 24 hours I had rented it and could never download it. So I am out $3.99. Don't know if I have any options to get my money back or better yet be able to watch the movie. Hesitant to rent another too if I will just lose my money.
2,"Great visuals, roughly pieced together","Beautiful actors, greats sets, weak story line. This is an example where you leave the book alone until another script writer and director can get their hands on it. It's a shame that with all the talent the American film industry has, that this is the best they can do with this novel."
2,could have been better,"After my wife and I both read the book, we decided to give the movie a try. The books were great, and ""the movie never lives up to the book"" is an understatement in this case. No character development, slowly moving plot, and important facts left out from the book made this movie a dissappointment."
2,Hunger Games -- Needs More Meat on Its Bones,"I read the Hunger Games in a day and it took me about three days to read Catching Fire. I'm planning to read Mockingjay to finish the trilogy. I didn't plan to see the movie, but decided to take a look. I thought the visual look of the film was well done. The casting was also well done. The only problem with the film was that the story was flat and seemed to just string together choice scenes from the book. Not much time was spent on character development. So it was hard for me to root for the characters. Maybe it is an editing problem because some scenes are too long or some scenes jump ahead that it seems something was missing in between. If people that saw the Hunger Games haven't read the book yet, I'd definitely recommend that they read the book to fill in the blanks."
2,"Blech. Good book, terrible movie.","Six months ago (roughly) The Hunger Games movie arrived in theaters. At that time I had no idea what the movie was about, but that there sure was a lot of excitement surrounding its release. Last week I read the book and last night I watched the movie and all I can say is ... thank God I read the book first or I wouldn't have known WHAT was going on in the movie. Good book, awful movie."
2,Read the book,The book was so much better than the movie. Don't bother buying movie read the book instead buy the book
2,"Great Story, good acting, poorly executed","When I pay to see a movie, I expect to be able to actually see the movie. This is a case where ""shaky cam"" does not work. The camera was shaking during parts where people are only talking. I get the technique. It can help to create tension, but come on film makers, don't over abuse it. Are you trying to give people motion sickness?Rant over.All in all the story is great. The actors are good but many characters are not developed enough. As much as I like looking at Jennifer Lawrence, watching her sit in a tree for half the movie is not very entertaining. They should have showed Peeta's experience during the Games while she was hiding. (Yes I read the book.)Let's hope the sequels are done better."
1,The Hunger Games,"I wasn't ever planning on watching this movie, but I broke down and rented it to see what all the hype was about.what did I find? A 2 1/2 hr snoozefest, many other reviewers have said much better then I can, but I'll give it a go. I thought the movie seemed to long and yet for the length of the film you never really get to know or care about the characters.The cinematography was well to my mind just plain horrid, I hate *shake-cam*.Now for all of you, who would tell me to read the books. I ask you, why should I have to read the book first to 'get' the ins and outs of the story? Even if it's movie one of a trilogy it should be able to stand on its own, no homework required."
5,Must see!,"Loved this movie! As with all movies taken from a novel, the book has alot more detail, but the movie followed the book well and the casting was perfect!"
2,It left too much out.,Unfortunately I read the books first and this movie was just boring andit left too much out. Did not follow the book that well. I WASTED MY MONEY onthis movie.
3,"Didn't read the book, the movie was just OK for me","I haven't read the book but was anticipating the movie because of all the hype. It definitely caught my attention enough to watch the whole movie and I thought it was OK but nothing exceptional. I do want to read the book now, just wondering what they had left out."
4,Happy Hunger Games,I really enjoyed this movie. I haven't read the books but I saw it in the theater and thought it was worth watching. I think I'll definitely watch the other movies when they come out. I love Jennifer Lawrence. She's the only reason I watch it. I'm still not gonna read the books though. I'm not really trying to become obsessed with this franchise but I will continue supporting the movies.
5,hunger games dvd,i love this movie. It gets better and better everytime i watch it. I cant get enough! Im sure you will get the same kind of satisfaction.
4,Pays fair homage to the book,"Yes, it omits some stuff that some people seem to consider to be key plot points. But, in all fairness, they did the best they could with the 2.5 hours they were given. And, they did some things they could NOT do in the book (and still keep a clear point of view)."
4,entertaining sci fi thriller,I was unexpectedly surprised. This movie surpassed my expectations. I feel there is a deep messsage hidden in the plot and story line that keeps you guessing
4,"Great Book, Decent Movie","If you loved the books, you'll appreciate the movie. If you didn't read the books, you'll probably still enjoy the movie. It seems fairly hit or miss, but as someone that read the books, I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it captured the key moments of the story. My fiance watched the movie with him, and having never read the books, still thought the movie was entertaining and easy to follow. He's looking forward to the next movie coming out."
3,Was a bit hyped up IMO,"All I can say is Jennifer Lawrence! The only thing that kept me going was her striking beauty, not the way your thinking either, she is just amazing and natural, not contrived like most others in movie. I hear the book was good."
4,Hunger games,The hunger games was really good but had just finished reading books so of course so much left out. The movie didn't really get thru much of the first book but it was good.
4,"Enjoyed story, close to story",The movie was done well highlighting major stages in story. Wish it was longer to capture more details as it went by fast.
5,Awesome!,This is a great movie! Extraordinary performances by josh hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence! I recommend this movie to everyone! It is great!
4,review,I loved the quality of the picture and sound. I also liked i was able to watch where ever and for 24hrs
5,Great movie,I loved the series and them movie was awesome! The product came as described and was the cheapest price around!
4,better than described,This DVD pack comes with a Digital copy code that you can use for a Ultraviolet copy or a I-toons copy of the movie in the box. I managed to be able to use the code 2 times one for I-toons one for Ultraviolet so I am happy.
4,A good movie,This was an entertaining movie. I gave it a four because I thought the ending was lacking but not disappointing.
4,Good movie I would recomend watching it.,The Hunger GamesI enjoyed this movie. my internet conection was slow so I had to watch it in low quality but the movie was good anyway.
3,Hunger Games BD,"I heard so much about how good this movie was, but I didn't find it to be exceptionally spectacular. I like action movies with lots of suspense and this did have some of that, but I guess overall, the movie just seemed to be lacking something to me. I'm sure it had good ratings because it appealed to others."
3,not what I thought,The storyline was good. But the characters were terrible. Crazy makeup lady really ruined this movie. An attempt to be dramatic that was more comical than anything.
3,disappointing,"Loved the books, but the movie was disappointing. Didn't follow the book on some key issues. If you hadn't read the books you would not have understood half the movie. When they make movies from books they need to be truer to the written word."
4,The Hunger Games - Looking forward to part 2,The Hunger Games was a very entertaining and thought provoking movie. I have to admit I did not read the book. Sometimes that can be a benefit. You end up spending more time comparing the movie to the book instead of rating it on it's own merits. I would highly recommend it.
3,Hunger Games was more Hype than action....,"I felt that this movie was over-rated by all the hype & press/media coverage. It didn't meet my expectations of ""scientific wizardry"" from thecontestant participants. Kinda disappointed."
2,Great only if you loved the story,"The movie was well made and the acting was great. If you were a fan of the books I'm sure that you would have loved this movie. I did not read the books and was considering not watching this since I knew the storyline. Well I came very close to turning it off. I found the story very very disturbing and hard to watch. It actualy bothered me to think about how popular this story was and that people brought their children to the theater to see it. Call me old fashioned or over protective, but there is no way I would have let my children see this. Bottom line is this is about children being forced to kill other children and I do not call that entertainment. I gave this video to my best friend and she felt the same way. We both agreed that we do not want to see the sequals. This is my personal opinion so if you are hating on me I really don't give a crap. I know a ton of people who loved the books and the movie, but again I found it very disturbing."
2,need to read the book,I read these books just before the movie came out. I missed it in the theaters but heard great things about the movie. Once I was able to rent I did. I was a bit disappointed in the movie. I'm glad I read the books because otherwise I'm not sure the whole thing made a lot of sense. They do follow the story plot but I feel they missed a lot. MY husband got the benefit of me stopping the movie for back ground explanations.
2,Very disappointing and confusing,"The movie loses a lot of depth from the book, too much in this case. There are too many unanswered questions on why things are the way they are - i watched this with some people who had not read the book and they really hated it. The movie is not as polished as it should be for it's big budget - some of the effects are truly awful."
2,"read the book, skip the movie",There is too much missing and left out of the story line to make this movie any good. By leaving out crucial details like the relationship between Gale and Katniss will alter the story line.as far as movies go the special effects were mediocre.
2,What a mess,"Maybe for fans of the book this is a good movie because they know the rest of the background that the movie did not cover. And it owuld have to a lot of background. Never really understand why Peter joined the ""evil alliance"" or why Rue did not kill the heroine when she had the chance. Had Rue already made up her mind? Just too many inconsistencies and unfinished or disconnected plot lines to make the movie believable, and I am not talking about the basic premise. That part I understood and accepted going in. Also, nothing explaining the difference between the ""emerald city"" dwellers and the districts, etc. A little more on that an some less scrubbing and bikini wax moments would have been useful for thos that have not read the book. Yes, amovie cannot go into all the detail a book can go into, but a poorly done movie will not motivate anyone to buy the book."
2,A Step Back,"This movie missed it on several levels,,1. The haves and the have nots,,2. Mixing children teens and preteens, and finally 3. Children KILLING children for entertainment"
4,The Hunger Games,I thought the casting was excellent. The movie did an excellent job of translating the book onto screen. I enjoyed it.
5,The BEST,Awesome book. Read them in two days; I had to see how it all ended. Adding it to my list of favorites.
4,better than I expected,"pretty faithful to the book; just a few incontinuities. obviously they are planning a second movie because the end was just... the end of the film, not the end of the story. i'd say read the book first; it will help make the film make more sense. The Hunger Games series, while I have criticisms, is one of the many good examples of young-adult literature out there these days."
4,Good stuff,"Haven't read the books, but from what my wife tells me they did a great job building on the book's foundation to create the first movie. Looking forward to the sequels."
4,Good movie,"It was a little over hyped, but a pretty good movie. The whole family enjoyed it. I would recommend it to friends."
4,great movie,I saw the movie in the theaters about 5 times and loved it. although the story line is rather bloody I think the director was good at drawing the line so it wasn't too bad. the only problem was that I couldn't down load it to my PC so I had to watch it on line.
5,great movie,"Jennifer Lawrence is awesome as Katniss and all of the supporting actors were great. Loved the books, loved the movie"
5,Favorite Movie!,"I bought the movies for my 10 year old daughter. She had already finished reading the book series. The DVD arrived sooner than I had expected. This movie has become my daughter's favorite now. She has watched it again and again, alone and with friends. It's a great price for the value and use!"
4,great,the product was here to me within the alloted time and was a very good copy no problems scratches or problems of any sort over all a great product
4,Hunger Games,"Think this a duplicate request for review but liked it so much that I rated it again. All characters were well cast, particularly Katniss.Gave it a 4 rather than 5 because I'd read the book and the condensed parts of the movie removed some the flavor and excitement found in the book detail.GJ"
5,hunger games blu ray,Hunger Games is a Great movie I can't wait to watch the second one when it comes out next year!
3,original book was way better,"I'm the big fan of the original book. So even the movie was pretty good, i thought it was too PG-13"
3,Hunger Games,"I had heard alot about the movie and of course the items for sale in stores. It was a dark story line, and weak in the end. Maybe its aimed at a younger crowd. Still, it was ok."
5,hunger games,"My husband and I, now understand why the reviews from the theater were so high. This was such a great movie."
5,merry christmas,Great gift for a granddaughter! she will love it you always have what I need thanks so much for that
4,This movie...,First time I saw it I was upset about all the things missing from the book. But now I love it
4,Hunger games?? DVD from Amazon,"Fairly good movie. But if you expected reasons for why or how this society got to this deplorable state you need to read the book. The book shows what happens to a society that allows the government to control all aspects of you life, present and future. The movie showed the results of the governmental control in the games but neglected to sow the progression of this path as it progressed. I expect that there will be a second film to follow to show the resulting effects of a overcontroling government and a people that still long for freedom.For Amazon the movie was delivered promptly as promised as with all purchases from Amazon. Amazon is the best on-line retailer out there!"
5,Leave me alone..,"I loved reading the books. I. Couldn't put them down. I was afraid the movie would be bad like Twilight...but it wasn't! I loved it. If I have it playing in my room, you better leave me alone : )"
4,"Move is good, book s always better","The movie was really good and I enjoy watching it. Wished it told more back story that the book has, but I will still watch the others as they come to DVD. For someone who never read the book, they will absolutely love the movie."
3,OK show,"I would say that the show was done to add to the advertisements for the books. It was an OK film, sometimes people talked too fast to understand what they were saying - when often it was important to understand the what and the why of the hunger games. Acting was OK - I felt that they didn't develop the characters very well in the beginning probably due to lack of time and large amount of content. Others will rave about this movie I am sure - I just thought that the plot was rather thin and veiled -- maybe it will appear when episodes 2 and 3 come out?"
5,Hungry for more Hunger Games,I went to the Hunger Games movie at 9:30am the first day and went two more times. I am 63 years old and had read all 3 books in about 2 weeks time. I hadn't finished any book in years. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss and I was also pleasantly surprised by the acting of Woody Harrelson. I love the Hemsworth brothers (Liam and Chris) so that was another plus. As the cast of Catching Fire is being announced I know I will be reading the books again since the sequel won't be out until November 2013. I bought a copy of this movie for myself and for a Christmas present. My copy is currently being passed around my water aerobics class since some of the seniors have read the books but not seen the movie. I recommend this movie very highly
2,All been done before,I have not read the books but was looking for an interesting movie to watch so got dragged in by the hype surrounding this one.The story line has all been done before and better. Refer to movies like Battle Royale or The Running Man for the game element and Twilight for the love interest and you are presented with nothing new in this movie.I gave it 2 stars as I am giving the trilogy the benefit of the doubt and hoping that this movie is only setting the scene for the real story I would expect from movies 2 and 3.On a positive note I may have been inspired to read the books after watching this movie as I am interested to find out the reasons behind the uprising and why everyone in the Capital is dressed like Lady Gaga and JeanPaul Gaultiers offspring!
4,hunger games blueray.,"the hunger games was really pretty good...............it was handled well and the bluray was well done............would have given it 5 stars but, just didn't think it was all and all fantastic."
4,pretty good,"I wasn't expecting much from the movie, but after watching it I have decided to read the books. Interesting satire."
5,Wonderful Movie,"I watched this movie because everyone was just raving about it, and I really enjoyed it, you'd think whats so great about a movie of kids being forced in an arena to kill each other? but that is not the focal point of the story, its about so much more! and every time you watch it, you get a little more. I rented this twice, read the books, and finally I bought the disc and digital copy.I rated this 5 stars because the movie did not go to far from the book, and the actors portrayed the characters so perfectly."
4,Good Movie,"This was a good movie, I haven't read the books but I hear they're also good. Jennifer Lawrence was great and I look forward to the next movies."
4,Non-descript politics makes it more enjoyable,"Yes, the whole theme of the movie is about the big 'ol corrupt central government (Capitol City) but there were no preachy political messages so the movies only real ""theme"" was about the transcendance of the human spirit over an unfair, corrupt system. I understand there are two more movies in this series to come out, so I hope the next two are as politically neutral as this one."
5,Hunger Games DVD,"A wonderful movie, well made and well acted. Enjoyed it tremendously, recommend it to everybody. Looking forward to the next oneAMS"
4,UH,"I loved to receive this only a few days after it came out, after pre-ordering it. There was one problem and that is that when I got it the discs were loose in the box, and there was a tear on the outer packaging. But the discs work fine, and the box itself was fine, so I guess I'm happy with it."
5,Great Movie,"The books were wonderful and the movie does not disappoint. My husband had not read the books, and he really liked the movie. It made him want to read the books."
3,Left me hungry!,"The Hunger Games movie left me feeling hungry---for the book! I thought that so much was left out or glossed over that I was disappointed with the final product. See the movie, but read the trilogy. It is far better."
4,Excellent trilogy,"Very entertaining series of books, perhaps a warning to our time that if we do not pull together as a nation we run the risk of fracturing into the social schism of haves and have nots you find in this story."
3,HD was not full screen,"HD was not full screen, movie was fair. Needed more starting info as to how thay came to be, had to guess."
3,"Pretty good movie,","Overall the movie was pretty good. But I thought it left a lot out of what was in the book, and I thought some of the actors were not the right ones for the part."
3,"If you like the book, don't watch",This is a bare bones version of the book. Don't expect too many elements from the book except kids killing kids in a distopian society. I highly recommend reading the books and don't bother with the movie.
3,review,This movie was real close to the book. I am glad i read the book first. Movie skipped alot and was kind of lost. You must read book first.
3,Predictable plot and shallow characters,"While heavy on the action and CGI graphics, I found little that was compelling about the movie. Their was little - if any - real character development, and in the end I did not really care if the heroes won or lost, or lived or died. The dialogue was too contrived and there were far too many cliches."
3,Meh...not great,"Not a great movie. It was just ok. I watched it and it passed the time, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone."
3,another teen movie,"The acting is fairly wooden, but it checks all the boxes for providing blockbuster entertainment in the tradition of Twilight."
3,Lost my appetite,"Maybe it's just the over hype, but this movie made me lose my ""appetite"" for the hunger fans. Did I expect to mug after reading the books, probably.Alas, as mix as I tried to like it, I never really cared...."
2,Hunger Games left me hungry!,"Hunger Games, the movie, didn't come close to the book. It left no impression on me and I can hardly remember the actors."
4,Good movie,I enjoied the movie but didn't read the book. I'm not sure how faithfully it followed the book but it was good.
4,Very good,You had to have read the book before watching it. It helps to clarify reasons for different scenes and the significance of them.
3,Just OK,"I was expecting a futuristic Sci-Fi movie. Instead I got a futuristic Teeny Bopper Love Story movie. Not anything close to what I was expecting. I obviously did not read the book(s). According to my daughter, who did read the books, it was not faithful to the novels."
1,Horrible movie,"Not only was this movie just plain stupid, it was too easy to guess what was about to happen. I didn't connect with any of the characters and the killing was largely useless. Also, the long, drawn out crying bit in the middle had me rolling my eyes."
2,Huge disapointment.,"What kind of mind thinks up a plot of adults expointing children to hunt and murder each other using food as the motivating factor, a disturbed one!I had not read the book and rented this flick based on the hype and advertisements for it EVEYWHERE. Donald Sutherland once again proves why he is not in many movies, he cant act.The ending just, well sucks.. not leaving us wanting for more but wondering why we bothered.If you have not rented it dont, wait for it to come out on HBO or one of the other premium movie channels and even then you will be disapointed that you wasted over 2 hours of your life watching this flick."
5,Best Movie Yet!,"This is a very suspenseful movie, and Very well done. I really liked how the movie was very similar to the book. I think they found a great way to take out enough of the book so that the movie wasn't hours long, and that they didn't take out some of the more important parts. I think having Susan Collins help with the movie gave us a better feel of how she wanted the characters to be portrayed in the book. this movie was one of the better movies I have seen, but you definitely should read the books before seeing the movie."
4,love!,"I read all three books in the series and waited so long for the movie......it didnt deliver. I mean i loved the movie dont get me wrong, but i expected more......maybe with the sequel? A definite must see, just be prepared if u read the book that u of course will be a bit disappointed."
1,SO disappointed,The book was AWESOME. I eagerly awaited the release of this movie and boy was I let down! The movie left out WAY too much. I understand needing to shorten things- but not at the expense of flat out ruining the movie. This movie should have been another 30 minutes long AT LEAST if it meant maintaining the quality of the character development and story line. What a waste- I felt jipped. Really doesn't leave me itching to see the next 2. I hope there is an improvement with the next 2 movies.
1,Terrible,"1 star only because i can't rate lower, has anyone that rated this higher actually seen it? It is a terrible story. Don't waste your money like I did in the theater with my wife and 12 year old daughter. This movie has a terrible story, why would anyone want to see it or recommend it to a ""friend"", after sitting through this we all said the same thing, why? and what is the hype? Terrible Terrible Terrible ..."
2,this movie sucks,"Phenomenal box office opening and hype and then you have it: an overlong, boring, no-climax and compromising movie. And do they really need a triangle love story in every movie? The shaky camera was totally annoying and unnecessary. The only redeeming quality was Wes Bently and his beard."
3,Hunger game?,I think that maybe I should have read the books first. I could really not get into the movie that much. Really out there even for me and I watch some really weird things at times. Maybe the next movie will be better and get more of my attention.
4,Enjoyed it!,I had been waiting for this movies since I read the trilogy several months ago. I found it very entertaining and very true to the book (as much as a movie of this length would allow). My husband watched with me (he didn't read the books) and enjoyed it also. We're both looking forward to the rest of the series!
4,Good plot,"I haven't read the books,but my family recommended this based on the fiction series.It was entertaining. I hope they will do the other books as well."
4,"Hunger Games, not really hungry for more",Read Hunger Games (on my Kindle) and it was ok. Watched the movie and it was good but not breathtaking. I would put it at better than Battleship but below Iron Man.
3,Not hungry for more,"Entertaining but mostly formulaic in the plot development. Acting was above average, and watching the movie is not a complete waste of time."
4,The Hunger Games,"An exciting picture with excellent acting. I did feel that I was watching a modern day reenactment of Spartacus. Having said that, Spartacus is one of my favorite films."
3,"For me, just so-so.","I read the series after the movie came out, but before I saw it. While the books are fairly entertaining, this is for me one of the rare occasions where the movie is better. If I'm not mistaken, the novels were aimed at a youthful demographic. If so, this could be the cause of my boredom. I'm old."
5,Great movie,Very interesting dialog. This movie makes it hard to believe that you were watching for over 2 hours 20 minutes.
1,"Dissapointing, dumb, and waste of time.","First off Pita was cast by some whiny punk kid from Zathura....need I say more. Katniss was a fine choice with Jennifer, Stanley Tucci did a great job, Woody Harrelson was lame, most of the other characters were okay except for the kids. This seems to be about as cliff notes of a book to movie as one could really get only touching on about 30% of the content that was in the book. I was very excited to see this movie and left the theatre wanting my time and money back. Everyone is raving about the movie but I feel it is just poor acting and bad script writing. I could only see lame Twilight droolers loving this one."
1,HUGE disappointment,"They rushed the story, screwed up just about every major point of the book, got rid of Molly and most of the makeup artists that helped Cinna, Woody acted way too sober to be Haymitch, the ""girl on fire"" dress wasn't impressive at all compared to how the book described it, I couldn't get a feel for any of the characters, and overall I felt like if I didn't read the books, I wouldn't have a clue what the hell the movie was about. After being let down by how the third book was written and seeing this movie, I'm under the impression that the author doesn't care about her audience because now she's making bank."
1,Hunger Games fail to entertain,"I almost stopped watching the movie. First of all, it was shocking to see that the theme of punishment from previous rebellious sectors was carried on from one generation onto innocent subsequent generations. And then when twelve years olds were being slaughtered, I was shocked. The hair, makeup and costumes of the establishment were ridiculous. The idea that people would watch children fighting for their lives on teleivision was nauseating. I would not recommend at all. It was terrible!!!"
2,What is all the hoopla about?,This is such a letdown of a movie. A dreadful plot--haphazard direction--cheap art direction and design and a cast of solid actors overacting. Big movies just can't keep on being this bad.
5,Great book/movie,I am very satisfied with the movie. It follows the book very well. I don't think they could of picked better actors/actresses.
3,"Nothing wrong with the movie, but not up to the book","This will be the last ""pre-order"" I do with Amazon. There was no advantage to this because I actually received my copy later than the store release. I was out shopping Walmart, Sam's, and others Saturday. They were loaded with this DVD, and it was the same price. Although I was offered the streaming copy through Prime it was not of the quality I will have with the DVD. I read the trilogy prior to watching the movie, and it helps quite a bit. I understand that the movie cannot include the detail of the book, and it was evident with this production. Entertaining movie anyway."
5,Best Book to Film Adaptation Ever,"This movie captures the horror of being drafted into a hopeless battle perfectly. I have read the books, and the movie changes only a few minor details. Jennifer Lawrence is incredible (as always). I can't wait for part 2 and 3."
3,Download code wouldn't work,The code to download the movie to itunes didnt work. iTunes stated the code had already been used which leads me to believe this was a pirated DVD
2,WEAK MOVIE,I was disappointed with this movie. After all of the hype about it I found it to be a letdown and not very well done.
3,Disappointing,"Was intrigued by The Hunger Games descriptions, so I first read all three books. They were excellent, well written and they grabbed me and kept me turning pages. I really looked forward to the film, but it was so insipid and disappointing compared to the books. The opportunity for great visuals in this day of CGI, especially with costuming and sets, was totally wasted. Time constraints seem to have forced too many cuts to the story line, which looses important details.As is generally true when translating books to images overall, the film did not have half the impact on me as the books. The underlying messages however, are still relevant and powerful, making it well worth watching."
2,eh,"This is an alright kids movie but it's an Adult story, written at a young age reading level, adapted into a kids movie with no I dunno, substance. So a great idea but watered down with each incarnation."
2,not my thing,"Didn't care for this .There was alot of action but I didn't like the ""dog eat dog"" message.Plus I felt there was to much build up about it. When I finally watched it I thought ""what was the big deal?"" Not a favorite . guess I should have read the book because the book is always better"
1,So... the digital copy is actually an itunes download,"Which was annoying because I can't stand iTunes. I wanted to share this DVD with friends by allowing them to watch it on their own DVD players and I thought I could because it was supposed to have a digital copy... unfortunately it didn't and my friends were unable to watch it... I'm forced to download it onto my computer! How stupid is that? If I could return it I would. I even believe that you are only allowed to download it once. Ugh. Waste of money.The movie however is entertaining. The books are better, but that's the way it usually is :)"
1,Misleading,"I wasn't happy with the product I received. I believed I was to receive a two-disc DVD and the digital copy which, I didn't really care about. All I received was the digital copy so I had to go out and purchase the DVD. Your advertisment was misleading. It would be nice if I received credit for my purchase since I can't use it. As far as the movie itself, once I got the purchased DVD home and watched it I really enjoyed the movie.I have purchased other items such as ""The West Wing, the complete series and ""I Lve Lucy,"" the complete series along with other videos and some books and have always been satisfied but this purchase did not."
1,Disappointing,"Not worth the money should have waited to come out on tv,customer review not accurate,next time I will take a closer look at other customer's opinion."
2,"bad dvd!, but movie was good to a point","I got the movie on time with no problems, but I was only allowed to watch about an hour of it before it freeze framed. I removed the dvd and found some defects on the disk. tried cleaning the disk and got the same thing. I even tried another dvd player and even cleaned my dvd players and got the same results. I would have sent the dvd back, but the cost and time to mail it is that worth the effort. So I downloaded the digital copy which wasted another 20 minutes of my time and was not happy with the mp4 compression on the video as it was not the best quality. Also your stuck using apple's itunes or quicktime to watch. I can't blame the seller for this problem, but lionsgate needs to improve it's quality control! Amazon is going to send me a replacement copy, and shipping label to return the defective dvd disk, how great is that!"
4,Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games offered an effective mix of a post-apocalyptic, segregated society with an elite political class ruling at whim, and how the victims of this new world order coped under the oppression."
3,Condemned for kids,"So this movie is basically about a once a year tv show, where kids/teens are placed in a dome to fight for their lives for the enjoyment of the public. The last person living wins fame and fortune. That's about all the details I'll give, as to not spoil the movie.Overall it's a decent movie. I don't really understand the hype for this series (Maybe I'm too old to get it). My kids really liked this movie, they had read the book before hand and only complained slightly about the differences. My wife referred to it as remake of the movie ""Condemned"" but instead of Stone Cold and other men, they used kids/teens. Throw a love story in there and you have this movie."
3,Left me hungry,Ok for the younger generation(especially females).My daughter enjoy it more. Can't see why a 2nd part would be needed but I guess to complete the book series.
1,Total rip off... 75 pages of uselessness,"Wow, did I miss the details or what.?!?!? I thought this was going to be a programming guide. Instead, its someone joke on how to create a Hello World kernel module... and its only around 75 pages... for $18... I bought a Linux Networking book for $15 that was over 600 pages.. I got ripped off, and so will you if you buy this book"

3,"Good, Despite Deceptive Premise.","The author writes eloquently about the decline of a culture that by and large was a 16th-18th century creation by the likes of George Buchanan. He correctly points out that the decline came just as much from within as from without.Nontheless, I highly enjoyed the detailed analysis. ""However, I still recommend Malcolm Chapman's Celts: The Construction Of A Myth"" & John Collis' ""The Celts: Origins, Myths, & Reinventions"" as a balance to Mr. Tanner's fine book."""
1,Dont Buy This,"This meter is a piece of junk. It fluctuates between 5 and 14 ph when you are testing, if you move at all it wont give an accurate reading, and the calibration is difficult. You would be better off guessing the ph rather than using this."
2,A Good Basic Phone but...,The reason I use Nextel's service is that I get better coverage here in N. Florida. The telephone was on special but I can see why. The telephone gives good service and I do use the camera which is OK but the pictures come out a little small even at large setting. BUT I would not recommend this phone for one key reason: The charger/computer connector. I have bad thoughts about the designer that created the plug at the bottom of the phone. The waterproof cover gets in the way of plugging-in andf you have to fiddle with it until you get a connect. I would not have another phone that uses this connection system...:(
4,Meh..Not Bad,"I need a Nextel for my work so this was my ""step up"" from old Nextel (i560, worthless piece of crap). So far no real complaints other than the battery life seems a little conservative. Has good screen size and resolution, much better than my old one. Browser is much much better than earlier generations. Buttons are big and easy to toggle. Sound quality, both earpiece and speaker, are excellent. The digital camera gets the job done but it's mediocre quality. Not recommended if you are looking to snap a picture of something important. Has a stylish, not flashy, look and the blue readout is actually quite cool. Recommend if you are purchasing second hand, probably could do better for about the same money buying another model new."
2,Flippin Problems with this model phone,"i850 2 wks after received--would power off everytime I closed it & also during calls. Sprint gave me HUGE hassel when trying to get it replaced. On phone with them 2:15 PM until 4:43 PM, went through LONG list of people who couldn't make a managerial decision and would transfer me to someone else or just keep me on hold extremely long time. One tried to sell me more expensive phone and telling me they DID NOT HAVE another i850 IN STOCK--I called back and another salesman said i850 was IN STOCK and did I want one. During final call I requested anyone in management and a lady finally took care of my call properly and 2-day expressed new phone, no charge.The aesthetic design and ease of use is lovely.The durability and value is LOUSY.I'll post again if replacement i850 is faulty as well."
1,Avoid this phone!,"I ""upgraded"" to this unit after using the i90c for a few years, and I would much prefer having my old phone back. The i850's so-called ""camera"" feature isn't even a megapixel, making the photos good for caller ID and little else. The phone (this is my second i850, as I had to turn my first one in because of malfunctions) is very slow to respond, often shuts off for no reason, unless I'm trying to shut it off, in which case I have to push the button and then wait to see if it's going to turn off. This second phone, which I've had less than a month, is exhibiting the same problems that caused me to turn the first one in. Not really malfunctoning, just a crummy phone."
3,Great Phone...Baaaaaaaad Battery life,"I love this phone. Its sound quality is great. New speaker phones are way louder and clearer than even last year's models. Screen is sharp (maybe nextel could release some high quality res. wallpapers on its site as they still sell one with LOOOOW res. for phones with low quality screens. Purchased wallpapers from nextel look fuzzy on this phone. Good for the phone, bad for nextel) and the phone in general is REALLY nice.Negative props on the battery life. Maybe it is becasue I am used to my Tmobile Motorola a630, where standby time was 3-4 days, but if you use your phone even an average amount, you can count on chargeing it every 1 1/2 days at least. I have gotten in the habit of doing it every night (and I don't use it that much throughout the day)That aside, still recommended."
1,Plastic,"I am not happy with this phone at all. I have had several nextle phones and this one is the most cheap looking. It is very plastic looking and the buttons sound like they are going to pop off any second. The back lighting under the key pads does not fully light the 1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9 keys whick makes it difficult to see in the dark. The reception seems to not be as good as the other phones either. I would have rather bought a used i830 which i loved."
5,Best in da buisness,I love this phone oh and for all you dumb people out there if you want a perfect camera go buy one this a phone.The picture setting would be better if you change the setting to fine and size to XL it will be beautiful. The design of the phone is cool. It is not that big. And dude that talks about the razr all the time. here is a news flash the razr sucks okay. I850 rocks
1,I can't stand this phone,"I've had the same problem as many of the reviewers on here. This phone has a problem with shutting down at any random moment. This is my 3rd i850 in less than a year and I'm sick of it! I'm sick of losing all of my pictures, etc. each time they have to replace it. Anyone looking to buy this phone should reconsider."
5,Caruso Rarities,"This CD features several Caruso recordings I haven't found elsewhere. It even has 2 Neapolitan songs from his hometown. The sound is excellent, considering these recordings were made almost 100 years ago. They were recorded by singing or playing music into a horn which had a needle at the other end, cutting grooves into a master record. My favorite selection is the song King Gustavo sings to Ulrica the sorceress from ""Masked Ball"" by Verdi.(""Tu se Fedele"")."
2,Sheldon wrote this????,"Not typical Sheldon thriller. Either he was in a hurry to publish something or his assistant wrote it for him. Okay fast reading, great for teenagers"
1,Are You Afraid Of The Dark,"This is the most puerile, ill plotted and poorly written novel I have encountered in years. The improbabilities are legion and the plot contradictions staggering especially coming from an author with Mr. Sheldon's credentials. This will definitely be the last time I even glance at one of his books much less purchase one. i"
3,Press PLAY on the DVD Player in your brain,"A nice return to form from the guy who gave us ""Master of the Game"" and ""Bloodline."" For awhile there, his books weren't exactly ""Sheldon like""; ""Tell me Your Dreams"" and ""The Doomsday Conspiracy"" were good examples of just average books that seemed almost thrown together.""Are You Afraid of The Dark"" reads at a break neck pace, with great character development, an original plot, and classic situations that leave you wondering how the characters will get themselves out of them. Amazingly, Sheldon keeps his creative edge in these said situations and pulls off some doosies!As usual, the main character(s) are heroic women who seem to have it all on the surface, but are really just human beings like the rest of us.Sydney's getting up there in years, so I wonder how many of these he can possibly have left. Keep it up!"
4,"not his best, but still worth the time","I've read all of Sidney Sheldon's books and do agree that it's not among his best books, like Master of the Game, but it was still a great way to spend my commute on the El."
2,Well.......,"If you like novels that are beyond reality you will like this book. Two goodlooking, but normal wives come together, and outwit professional hit men while at the same time seem to have an endless supply of cash. I agree with other reviewers that this book reads like a bad T.V. movie of the week. I would hope that a seasoned author like Mr. Sheldon could come up with something better or at least more realistic."
1,Not worth the money,"Oh, Mr. Sheldon. If you had something to say about our government's weather manipulation experiments, couldn't you have wrapped it around a good story? This book read more like one of your screen scripts, i.e., choppy. The characters were boring and predicable and so were the events. This one's not worth the time or money."
1,DUH?,"An average of three and a half stars? From people who are literate? So I ran through the first twenty or so reviews and there they are. Well, the reason I give it one star is because zero isn't offered as a choice and besides I finished the book.(I finish everything, including those lenghty pamphlets that come with new drugs.)Every chapter (remember, I read it all) has at least one event that is illogical, unreasonable and stupid. I've read better comic books and seen B flicks that are intellectual by comparison. Fogeddabout it!"
2,least Favorite Sheldon Novel,"I have read 10 Sheldon Novels and this was my least favorite. Kelly and Diane either are cats with 9 lives or those pursuing them are the most incompetent clowns in the underworld universe. Also, with there lives in constant danger there is a such thing called police to seek out help from. Oh yea, Diane tries this and the detective is transfered. That means he does not turn his case over to his replacement? Was he the only detective in NYC?The other books I read had narrow escapes but the ones that Kelly and Diane get out of are so unrealistic that I found myself reading a comedy. I was waiting for ""Angel"" (Kelly's dog)to also be involved in the conspiracy also. (Heck, the rest of the characters in the book was including the person I bought it from at the store. I hope the next Sheldon novel I read has a plot along with twist that are more plausable."
2,A MUST SKIP!!!,"No way near what hes used to writting. I didnt even finish the book. I was completely lost, bored and had to stop reading. I have read all of his books and the rest are amazing. I discovered Mr Sheldon when I read If Tommorrow Comes, back in High School, its top on my list! Read it in high school and was amazed! I can now say school served its purpose..hehehe"
1,"DUMB,DUMB,DUMB!!!!!","I agree with the above reviews. I was so excited that this book would live up to The Other Side of Midnight, esp. after reading the 4 and 5 star reviews. Obviously these people don't read much. This book was so predictable, and the characters were so awful! The dialog was just stupid. He writes of one character dying on a respirator, but he is talking to them! PEOPLE ON VENTILATORS DON'T TALK, SYDNEY!!! Sorry folks, Sydney is not back."
1,Not up to his usual skill,"Sydney Sheldon has always written great books so I bought this one on faith. I believe he used his name and his readers to push his political ideas. Not good, I don't want to be used, I want to be entertained. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Terrible!,This book is terrible and it pains me to say so! I have been such a huge fan of Sydney Sheldon and have really enjoyed many of his books but the dialog alone was at times so corny I would cringe!! Save your time and read one of his earlier books!
1,Who wrote this tripe,"This is bad beyond words. Terrible characters, plot and narration. Decent cover though! And what has the title to do with anything? No more, please, I give!"
1,A slow-witted and stupid story.,"I have read many wonderful books by Sidney Sheldon however, this better be the last one. 'Are You Afraid of The Dark?' is a childlike story about a couple of half-witted women chasing after a conglomerate army of equally half-witted thugs. It's a stupid story of epic proportions and not worth the price.Mark HillerChehalis, WA."
1,What a waste of money and time.....,"I've previously quite enjoyed Sheldon's other books but there seems to have been a massive decline in quality since his first few books, either that or I've gotten smarter. From the first chapter I kept thinking how ridiculous the book seemed to be getting. This is easily one of the DUMBEST books I've ever read. I kept hoping the heroines would just die and put me out of my misery. Everything was so highly implausible and disjointed. I mean, for example, when the heroines are having a shopping spree in a pharmacy. Please someone point out the relevance?! I still don't know why (or how) I finished the book!"
2,A bit disappointed,"After waiting so long for the next Sidney Sheldon novel to come out, all I can say after having read it is that I am disappointed. If you love Sidney Sheldon then you will be happy with all the international cat-and-mouse chases, evil-evil bad guys, gorgeous brainy independent women, and lots of references to sex. However, the plot is transparent and the technological wizardry stuff is just plain hokey. With this book you can see every thing coming four pages before it happens. There is no suspense, and you know what is going to happen to each character the very moment that they are introduced. However, if you have nothing better to do, and just want to spend some time being amused, go ahead and read the book. It is without a doubt Sidney Sheldon's ""lightest"" read. There just isn't enough to it after such a long wait."
1,Horrible Piece of Fluff,"This book sucked. I'm sorry to say it so bluntly, but I had definitely expected more from Sidney Sheldon, and this was a barley laughable waste of time...there is NO character development, and the girls, as noted by an earlier reviewer, got out of EVERY situation in the most corny, unrealistic ways. What was even more irritating than that was Mr. Bad Guy Kingley's remark EVERY SINGLE time they did that..kinda like a newer version of ""Curses, foiled again!"" The girls would escape and he'd go ""Damn those bit**es!!"" Hahaha, okay, maybe that was laughable, but really, don't waste your money. This plot would have been better off sometime after midnight on any B Movie cable channel...I.E: Lifetime."
3,Still waiting!,"I keep hoping for another novel as gripping as The Other Side of Midnight, but alas this isn't it. Are you afraid of the dark? was okay, but just didn't grab me. It took me a month to get through it and would typically only take a few days for a novel I really was into. It was enough to keep my buying Shelton in hopes that he'll wriite another thriller that captures my imagination, but ---"
2,Surprise! It's Sidney!,"Said the World's Master Storyteller Sidney""Of predictable life will you rid me?""A nod. He said ""Swell!""As they reached the motelWhere he woke in the bath minus kidney.Danger! Shock! High voltage! Oh, I can hardly contain myself it's so exciting reading Sidney Sheldon!Yeah, more of the same from Master Sidney. Why do I even keep reading these things? I should know by now that The Other Side of Midnight was a fluke and nothing else he ever wrote is even close to being as good. Stupid me, still hoping Sidney Sheldon will surprise me..."
2,Not worth your time,"This story is predictable, trite and utterly clichÃ©. The successful author that Sidney Sheldon used to be is no where to be found in this B-movie book. I do not recommend it."
5,Cassettes are better 2,"If you didn't see my other cassettes are better preview, this was basically it. My father lost most of his vision and prefers cassettes to CDs because he can stop and then start where he left off rather than trying to find where he stopped by skipping forward on CDs. He loves Sidney Sheldon and mysteries."
3,not dat bad!!!,The author starts off the book well but... it gets boring half way through... everything gets predictable and boring...
2,The worst yet!,"The good part is that the book is easy reading, anyone (even a ten year old) can understand what is happening. You will finish the book in one sitting over a couple of hour.Sadly the characterization is appalling, the author has not even tried to give a semblance of personality to the main characters. These key players are there for a purpose, which they deliver and vanish. The story has no sub plots but it has a lot of deviations which amount to nothing in the context of the main plot.In all the writing and the plot are too simple and predictable.It is tired effort by the author, who has written much better books. This time he has taken his readers for granted.Avoid it if possible, don't expect much if you do read it."
2,"Good Story, Poorly Written and Bad Characters","I have never read a Sidney Sheldon book, but I heard from my sister that he is a great mystery writer. So, I checked the book out or actually I borrowed my sister's copy and let me just say that it was a piece of work that was mesmerizing and interesting. Although it had a good plot, the characters were really sucky and obvious. Plus, it was a bit of obvious writing as well, it could have been better if Sidney Sheldon had a more developed writing style for this book and better characters. Other than that everthing else is find."
2,Are you afraid of the dark?,"Are you afraid of the dark? Sidney Sheldon- A fairly disappointing novel from the standpoint that it was very predictable and farfetched. This novel gave the appearance of someone's first attempt or a writer that was tired and just putting out a book for a quick sell. My guess is about 1 - 2 months of work with many interruptions. Some research involved but all in all, research that could be had over the internet with a day or two of searching. Some technical phrasing appeared as if it was quoted directly from the source. This book would be good reading for someone that doesn't want to think too much and just be carried through a implausible story. I am sorry to say, it appears to be written for a quick ""made for T.V."" movie with a possible sequel of two unlikely female private detectives. * October 23, 2004"
1,waste of time,I always try to finish a book after I start one. This one was hard labor.First book I read by this author and it will most likely be the last.
1,Ridiculous,"I know it's Sheldon but this book was laugh out loud funny for it's stock characters, cliche-ridden dialogue and a plot so outrageous that ""suspending one's disbelief"" is impossible. Overall quality? Think ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."""
2,Did Sheldon actually write this?,"This is one of the worst I've ever read. Were his earlier novels that much better, or is it just because I was much younger? Master of the Game is one of my all-time favorite books, but this one is awful. I didn't care about the characters, and the evil genius was so over-the-top bad, it was laughable."
2,No Longer Master of the Game,"Story of a maniacal businessman/scientist who wants to control the world by controlling the weather.Two women whose husbands he employed have died mysteriously. One of the women, Kelly Harris, immediately hops a plane for Paris to New York when the Grand Pooh Bah summons her for a talk. If only she'd had the common sense to stay home. The two women have a series of misadventures, which include a shopping trip where they are thrilled to purchase pantyhose and slips. I don't think so, Mr. Sheldon.Although neatly tied together, this novel is not credible. Might make a tolerable TV movie."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!,This book is so horrible that I won't even pass it on for my friends to read. They would hate me forever for wasting their time.The reviews for this book are a far more interesting read. I can't help but wonder who would give this atrocity 4 or 5 stars unless it is a ploy by the publisher to up the number of stars so that people will purchase this substandard book.I am not a picky reader. If a book is entertaining I generallly like it. This book is so horrible it is insulting.When I ordered this book I also got Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking. Now THAT was a good book!
1,Not anywhere near his usual...,"I found this book to be so far below the quality of Sheldon's other work that it is hard to believe he even wrote it. I have enjoyed all his other books, but this lacked plot, character development and a decent story line. The outcome was predictable and that is unusual for his work also."
1,don't waste your time or money,It's obvious people have different tastes in books! I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The underlying gimmick - whoever controls the weather has power - is cute but the story is stupid and badly written. The characters are stereotypes - stick figure stereotypes at that - and the power and resources at the hands of the bad guy(s) are over the top. Maybe it's supposed to be a parody but to me it seems like the author whipped of a quick book to squeeze a little more money out of his name.
4,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"All around the globe, people are being reported dead or missing. Taut with suspense and vivid characterization. Sheldon, a master at the storytelling game. If you want a novel you simply cannot put down, this would be a good choice."
2,Stormy Weather,"Around the world in different places, four people who are connected with a ""Think Tank"" company, are murdered. The company is headed by a charismatic go-getter, Tanner Kingsley and his brilliant scientist brother who suffered a tragic accident while reviewing a nerve gas and is now reduced to a mumbling shadow of himself. The beautiful widows of two of the victims join forces to outwit the resources of the powerful and influential Kingsley when he sends his hired goons to kill them, in case their husbands had talked too openly about their current project. The women whisk themselves around the world in an attempt to escape Kingsley's clutches....I can't go on! This is the silliest, most juvenile book ever, written in short, staccato sentences and I find it difficult to believe that it was even written by Sidney Sheldon."
3,"Interesting, but forced.","I enjoyed Sheldon's characters, but found the writing to be forced in places. The flashbacks were just painful to endure- he may as well have placed ""This is a flashback!"" in huge block letters before the event. The foreshadowing was just as subtle, with every victim ending their life at the sentance ""And he/she did not know that this would be the last breath/night/word he/she would breathe/see/say.""I gave two stars for the plot and one star for technique."
1,What a disappointment!,"I'm usually a big fan of Sidney Sheldon . . . so when I sawhis latest novel--ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?--I listenedto it with great anticipation . . . and was I ever disappointed!It was terrible; in fact, the worst Sheldon I have ever readand/or heard . . . it is a supposed thriller about two widowswho race around the country, trying to discover the secretbehind their husbands' deaths.I found the underlying premise (a company with a machinethat can control the world's weather) unrealistic . . . even moreunbelievable was the fact that the women were able to escape,over and over . . . make that, over and over still more times . . .from the hands of supposedly proficient killers.Only the narration by Marsha Mason managed to keep my interest."
1,Simplistic Junk,"Sidney Sheldon's ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" is a prime example of the generic crap that a `name' author often churns out just to make a buck.Nobody would buy this book if some no-name had written it, and no publishing house would even consider putting something as boring and generic and just plain stupid as this in print had it been the work product of an unknown.This book is simplistic formula to the max and is not worth your time or money."
2,"Amusement, yes; Accuracy, No.","Yes, the novel is fluff. Yes, the plot is more than far-fetched. Yes, the author leaves too much unexplained.BUT, one of the protagonists is taking a shower in an American hotel, ""The water was getting cold."" Right on!Two of the protagonists buy disposable cellphones that they use in Europe. Hello?? European standards for cellphones are not compatible with U.S. standards.One of the evildoers is in the Barcelona, Spain airport, and gets on a plane by stating (without identification) that he's with the FAA. Hello?? The FAA has not jurisdiction in Europe, they might grant him some privileges after seeing identification and talking with him.At least this book will soon disappear, unlike the writing of Charles Dickens or that fellow from Stratford-on-Avon."
2,Did Sheldon really write this?,"I really find it difficult to believe that Sidney Sheldon wrote this piece of fluff. The characters are one dimensional cardboard and the plot rolls along from one implausible miracle to another.You have four murdered scientists, two beautiful rich heroines (Kelly and Diane) and the villain who has discovered how to manipulate the weather and wreak havoc unless particular countries cough up a king's ransom.This is one of the poorest novels I've read in years."
1,Not worth the wait or time needed to read!!!!!!!!,"One star doesn't begin to not rate this book. Sheldon has joined my list of ""not worth reading again"" along with Grisham and Clark. He has totally lost his touch and anyone who gives a good review of this book has incredibly low standards or is being paid to do so. There is no character development - characters are wooden at best. Storyline is completely predictable and jumps all over the map. Don't spend your money or even check it out of the library. Sheldon has been on a long slow decline for several books and has finally bottomed out. Time to retire Sidney - your magic is gone."
1,The Worst Sheldon I've Ever Read,"This is without a doubt the worst I've ever read from Mr Sheldon. So much that I'm having a hard time believing this is a novel of his. He was such a master of the game (hint). Over the years I've enjoyed his novels mainly because of his beautiful writing and portrayal of strong women. The two women in this novel weren't the least bit interesting. I never came to care whether or not they made it through their predicament. I just didn't care. I'm always willing to suspend my imagination in just about any given situation, but most of the scenarios here were so simplistic and implausible that it was laughable. So disappointing. To give this harsh a review isn't easy, but I take my reading serious and usually expect much better from someone who's listed on ""My Favorite Authors"" list. Even if they've been around a long time."
1,I know 6th graders who can construct a better story.,"This novel doesn't even comes close to any previous Sheldon work. It is trite, the plot is non-existent, the characters are cardboard at best and say the stupidest things, and the whole thing is a huge waste of time. I gave it one star because that's as low as the ranking goes. For work of this caliber Amazon needs a line of minus stars.The sad part is this novel was most likely only published to trade on the previous well-done work by this author, and that is the only reason i read it.You know, there is much validity to the cliche ""quit while you are ahead"" and it is really a shame that Sheldon 's editor didn't remind him of that."
1,Terribly Disappointing,"I have been a Sidney Sheldon fan for years, but could barely get through this book (as opposed to his previous books where I would stay up until 3am to finish). The majority of the text is boring flashbacks that add very little to the plot...you can skip over sections of the flashbooks and not miss out. The story itself had a promising backdrop, but none of the classic Sheldon traits are visible. No real suspense or suprise endings, very flat, obvious characters. True Sheldon fans will be highly disappointed."
3,3 1/2 stars,"I agree that the believability factor is not really here, especially as far as the weather machine and the escapes are concerned, but I did enjoy this novel--much like I would enjoy a burger over steak sometimes--it's simple to read with not a lot of added verbiage. It was fun entertainment."
5,Not Holdsworth....,"In response to a previous reviewer, Bill Connors does NOT sound like Allan Holdsworth. I suppose if you have a completely uneducated ear there is a similarity in their legato approach. Both guitarists love Coltrane and strive for a horn-like feel in their lead playing. Enjoy them both for their stunningly unique and creative voices."
4,Is This Holdsworth? Or...,"This music and Bill's guitar playing sound too much like Allan Holdsworth. In fact it sounds exactly like Allan Holdsworth. Don't get me wrong, I love that sound, but it seems kinda odd that an established guitarist would want to sound just like somebody else. Enough of that. This cd is full of great music and should be appreciated by all those who love great guitar."
5,it's love,"I feel in love with the woman who would become my wife when she played ""Texas Jail Cell"" for me. ""Sexual healing,"" indeed."
5,"Very good, covers all ground unless you're a specialist.","I may assume you have updated this book, as mine does not have disc cameras mentioned. Covers most topics untill you become so specialized, you need to find out your own information- sometimes very difficult. Excellent standard text for the average collector.Peter Venema"
1,Very Disappointing,"From the title of this book, as a Collector's guide, I would have expected to find the current values of the cameras listed instead of the original purchase price."
4,"Funny, cute and cheap little things","I've bought the Bumblebee and Soundwave pack because they were the transformers i liked most when i was a kid.These figures DO NOT TRANSFORM, and you must have that in mind if you buy them for a kid.However, they are poseable and you can twist their arms and their heads around. They are very stable and they will keep standing up in almost any position; they also seem to be made of some kind of rubber.The main reason why i like these little robots is that they look exactly like the cartoons. Not like the transformers G1 toys. Instead, they look chunky, cartoonish and fun. Bumblebee has a smirk on his face just like he did on the animated series. Soundwave seems to be pointing at himself like asking ""Who, me ?"". They seem to be having a lot of fun and i've just blue-tacked them to the top of my computer monitor as an ornament. I will probably get all the other figures."
3,Needs further revision,"I should have paid closer attention to the copyright date (2003). Some of the wrecks illustrated in this book have changed quite a bit in the last 5 years so the drawings are of little real use. There are newer wrecks that are not mentioned at all since, at the time of publishing, they were still afloat.There is still a lot of good information regarding older wrecks and reef though."
3,Good as one resource,"I have used this book as a primary textbook in a short-term tutorial course for undergraduates. Their goal is to prepare to be volunteer medical interpreters and assist monolingual nurses who serve farmworkers in under-served rural areas. Advantages: 1) one can hear frequently-used vocabulary in a clinical setting 2) the medical vocabulary has a context - recordings of patient interviews - and is therefore more helpful than memorizing endless lists of medical terminology. Disadvantages: 1) the book comes with audiotapes rather than a CD - technologically out-of-date 2) the anatomical drawings are rather rough. I recommend purchase of a Spanish-English medical dictionary as an important supplement. Despite what one reviewer wrote, I see nothing demeaning about the cultural content and my student volunteers - many are Latinos - have never complained about any stereotypical portrayals of Latino patients in the book."
2,The title is a stretch at best,"Comprehensive ? Yes.Dictionary ? Yes.Illustrated ? Emphatically, no!I do not count >30 miniscule black and white charts and bar graphs as illustrations. My wallet feels abused and has a bad taste in its mouth."
1,knobs by cns,unfortunately when i orderd these knobs the page from which i ordered them lead me to believe i was purchasing these knobs in antique pewter. Whenthey arrived to my house they were in fact ploshed brass so i sent them back. CNS was great to work with and it was an easy return. Amazon told me the purchase page was a mistake and apologized
2,Flowed Only One Time,"Today, my friend was hosting a baby shower & asked to borrow my chocolate fountain. I had only used it one time before. We set it up according to the directions & the fountain flowed for about 2 minutes and then it stopped. The plastic rotating piece in middle that creates the flow of chocolate had been deformed: the metal twisting auger melted the plastic .Since I just bought this a few months ago and only used it once, I called Rival to find out about the replacement of this part (they supposedly have a 1-year warranty). I was told that they could not honor the warranty since the product has been discontinued. Furthermore, even if the product had not been discontinued, I was told that Rival does not honor warranties on products bought on Amazon. Basically, I now have a really expensive chocolate fondue pot. I wonder if this is why this product has been discontinued."
5,Was a hit at the baby shower!,"I bought this to use at a baby shower I was hosting, and everyone really enjoyed it. We left it on for about 3-4 hours and didn't have any problems. I didn't feel right giving it fewer stars based on cleaning it, because it was not hard at all in terms of the product itself, but seriously, what can you expect when you have to clean a chocolate fountain? :-) Assembly was easy, melting the chocolate and oil was easy, and all worth it to have something unique that had people talking."
3,chocolate fountain,This product was very noisy. I am trying to contact the seller to see what I should do. It is too loud to use in the house.I called Monday and have not had my phone called returned.
1,Oil in my CHOCOLATE ???!??!!!,"I was so excited to recieve the Chocolate Fountain, but when I read the directions it required adding OIL to the Chocolate.YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know I read a discription for one that did not put oil in it. I will be returning this item! Sadly disapointed. :("
2,It doesn't work,I received my chocolate fountain in September 2007 after it had been delivered to the wrong house. I didn't try to use it until December and found out it didn't work. I have tried to contact Rival about this problem and I haven't heard from them. I'm pretty sure this is a great item but I will never know because it doesn't work.
4,Great fountain for home use!,"This is a good fountain for the price. It is easy to use and easy to clean. It is a little bit noisy, but certainly not loud enough for it to be a major draw back.HUGE HIT at every party!I would definately recommend this product. It is a great value. Your guests will get a real kick out of this! Loads of fun."
5,Rival Chocolate Fountain,"Great product. Great for the holidays. I used candy melting chocolate instead of chocolate chips. I set up a big bowl of ice beside the fountain with a plate covered with wax paper in the middle of it. The kids dipped strawberries, pretzels, animal crackers, ritz bits and marshmallows and put them on the plate to harden. They loved doing this and after the chocolate hardened they used the plate to serve everyone.The only problem was the cleanup of the fountain. I had to do this job and it was really messy."
1,Poor Quality Fountain,"If I were to purchase another chocolate fountain I would spend more money and get a better quality one. I couldn't get an even cascade of chocolate, even though the fountain was perfectly level. The chocolate doesn't stay hot enough either. It only stays hot for a few minutes, then it stays at room temperature. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this unit."
4,It's bigger than it looks,"The fountain is bigger than it looks, but is wonderful for a big party.The seller had to ship it twice (at no additional cost), since the first one arrived broken.An awful experience turned into a very good one."
1,urgent,"hello i ckecked my credit card and appeared you charged this product, and you sent me a email and you said me ""the order from Noble Direct has been canceled""... ""Your credit card was not charged for the order"" please i need you arrange this error, it's urgent."
2,one time fun,"I baught this chocolate fountain and brought it to a baby shower and it was definitely fun. I used the liquid chocolate from J&D Fine Foods, so it was really easy to set up and tasted really great. Unfortunately it only lasted for two hours and then the chocolate cascade stopped. After the cleanup I noticed that the auger was all worn out, since it was just made out of plastic. Too bad. I contacted Rival but this product is discontinued and I could also not get a replacement part from them. However, they offered me to get another item as replacement. If I ever buy another chocolate fountain I will probably get a smaller unit."
5,Great customer service,The chocolate fountain broke but the company was great at giving me a credit....no worries!
5,Strut Mount,Arrived on time. Easy/essential to install when replacing rear struts. Exact fit and fixed an annoying strut knock I had in one rear strut.
5,very pleased with purchase,My wife was very pleased with her gift. I was pleased with the prompt delivery and the items received.
4,Somewhat difficult but quite revealing,"As the French monarchy began to implement ""absolutist"" policies, the pays d'etat, provinces with their own representative Estates which handled tax collection, were a barrier to crown policy. Hickey's book considers the implementation of ""absolutism"" in Dauphine, and shows how, ultimately, it wasn't crown policy but instead the inability of provincial factions to agree that brought about a restructuring of the tax system, the great herald of ""absolutist"" government. This is a difficult book, and requires some level of knowledge of what was involved with ""absolutist"" government and how French taxation worked, but it is an important work in considering ""absolutist"" government in provincial France."
2,Disappointing and Forgetable; more like a Star Trek episode,"I have always loved the mysteries surrounding the Irda, and have had several ideas around them. I was more disappointed by their portrayal in Summer Flame (actually, my only disappointment with that book), but this one doesn't have a plot to back it up. The characters are nicely colored and attention is given to the fact that they're still ogres, but nevertheless, I cannot remember for the life of me what the plot was. I suggest the Kagonesti, instead."
1,"Not the greatest, by far.","To start I am an avid Dragonlance fan, in fact, it is my favortie series and I personaly have over 35 paperbacks and a few hardcovers. I am writing this review to tell all other Dragonlance fans to find another book before reading this one. This is the first Dragonlance book I had to put down because I just couldn't read any more. I dont even recall what the story involved. Usually with a Dragonlance book I read untill the roof falls on my head. Even then if I didn't die I would keep on reading. However this book bored me, failed to excite me in any way, and was in my opinion poorly written. It took me a span of 2 years to finish. Other novels have been devoured in a day. Now Linda P Baker has written other books and Im not saying she is a low caliber author, but this book was just plain bad. I didnt like it, and this is the first Dragonlance book I have said this about. Thank you for reading, thats my two steel."
1,The Worst of the Series,"I had looked forward to reading this one because I had found the Irda to be fascinating when they were mentioned in other Dragonlance books. But this novel was an absolute disaster. First of all, the author does not know how to write and should be sent back to grammar school. Secondly, where was the fantasy? Basically, the Irda were depicted as Krynn's version of blue-skinned, modern-day Americans. On top of that, the most important element of their culture -- the fact that they were transformed into ogres -- happened so fast and ended so abruptly that you had to wonder if the author was just plain tired from writing such a pointless story. The book was boring, disappointing, and a waste of time and money."
3,"Not bad, but not good either","This is a good book, but it's not DragonLance - it reminds me of a soap opera. It's really odd for a DragonLance book. By no means a failure, but I expected something more along the lines of a typical fantasy novel when this is more dramatic (of sorts). I didn't like it that much, but I have to give it credit because it's storyline isn't that bad and everyone wanted to know how the Ogres fell from the light."
3,It Blows...,"Compared to killer blaks, this album is rubbish. I have both and I hardly ever listen to tanked and pogoed."
5,libros..,Buena vista homurosa de nuestro politicos en latino america. Llego por correo rapido y a precio bueno.
5,Cuentos chinos,A book that everybody should read. Excellent book to share with friends that still give credits to socialism way of government.
3,Verdades y Falacias,"Disculpen la falta de acentos.Como cualquier ser humano, Andres Oppenheimer tiene sus matices objetivos y subjetivos. Es un libro que se debe leer con reservas y hay cosas cuestionables como la generalizacion de que un obrero aleman gana 38 dolares la hora, que le van restando credibilidad poco a poco.Tiene sin embargo muchos conceptos rescatables y el libro se debe leer con apertura.Un detalle que me sorprendio en la seccion de Irlanda es que siendo el mismo Oppenheimer reportero, pasara por alto a la asesinada periodista Monica Guerin que sento un precedente muy importante en la sociedad irlandesa y cuyo asesinato acelero una serie de reformas legales para combatir el crimen organizado en Irlanda."
3,Can I get it in English?,"This is not a review, but a question. Is this book available in English? It is also a complaint. Amazon.com does a terrible job of listing books from other languages. I have had this problem repeatedly. Very often the listing doesn't say what language the book is in, sometimes it is a translation but no translator is listed, etc. I went through hell trying to decipher the Amazon.com listings for Martin Fierro by Jose Hernandez. Ended up ordering a Spanish version that I thought was English. The same problem exists with books from other languages."
3,"Not what I expected, but still entertaining","I don't know whether I'd call this one horror or not. There's not much scaring going on, and almost everyone in the story gets along, except for the antagonist, who is mainly seen through toward the end. Sure, there are horrifying scenes, like with the sadistic, snake obsessed, drug dealer, but overall this one reads light and comical.The main characters are easily latched on to. They seem real and although they pity themselves a bit too much at times, their personalities are amusing and deep.The thing that wins this novel over from stale to something- you -cant -put -down- to- save- your- life is that there are surprises along the way that jarred me to the floor. Things about one of the protagonists I would have never imagined. Some of it was predictable, sure, but for the most part: complete disbelief.In the end, I wouldnt pay a lot of money for it, but it was still worth reading and, when read, kept my attention big time."
1,"""Pretty Woman"" meets Vamps","This book lacks a decent story-line, the plot is unimaginative and not detailed enough and too fast-paced, the sex scenes are crude, there is no in dept study of any character... I'm an Anne Rice & Laurell Hamilton fan so I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to Vamp stories. I'm sorry but this is the worse book I've read on the subject"
4,Good introduction to one area of post-modern thinking,"The idea of a solid, centrally located ""I"" or ""self"" somewhere in our psyche is fast becoming history. We are all becoming chameleons responding to ever expanding social roles and identities. The ""I"" is becoming a group of ""we"" in the post-modern age. Anderson does a good job in exploring the ground of this aspect of psychology. Some chapters are better than others, but all in all a good introduction. I am not a psychologist but a general reader, and this book was pleasant and easy to read, and was filled with lots of others names associated with the field. However I'm sure someone in the field would find it a trifle superficial and old hat. So be it."
2,A book that practices what it preaches,"Anderson describes a world in which the self is endangered, nearing extinction. Though his style is charming, funny, appealing to the masses, his ideas, as innovative as they seem, really have too many loopholes to be accepted in the academic world. It is a glitzy, superficial book making a circular argument about the ""liberation"" of the human being from the concept of self. The idea is good, but each chapter really needs a lot more explaining to really get to the whys and hows of things, if he's really serious about making a social statement. Otherwise, this book is as souless as the society he describes."
1,Little scientific rigor in Anderson's analysis of the self,"Anderson basis his book on an argument that has little to do with analysis and much to do with superficially convincing the reader to accept his position as true. It makes me so upset when writers attempt to manipulate the reader, as if we are stupid and cannot distinguish between real evidence and the general, abstract references he has presented. I hope that this book will not be taken seriously by the readers, and that someday someone will explicate these theories in a REAL analysis."
1,BE WARNED: NOT THE DVD ADVERTISED,"Potential buyers should be warned that this is not a DVD version of the made-for-film production that includes Angela Landsbury in the cast, though her name certainly appears on the box cover in the advertisement, the product description, and the reviews. It appears that none of the reviewers actually own a DVD copy of this film, and are therefore commenting on a different production than the one being sold (which I already own). As I remember, the production being sold here has sound issues, and the volume fades in and out. Nonetheless, ""Hyacinth Bucket"" gives a very strong performance as the foolish nursery maid, and the production has other appealing features to collectors."
1,NOT THE RIGHT MOVIE,"Unbelievably, the sellers of this product changed the credited name on the photo of the cover from ""Patricia Routledge"" to ""Angela Lansbury."" This is the STAGE VERSION, not the movie version which includes Angela Lansbury in the cast. If you are looking for that movie, it was not produced as a DVD in the US- you will either need to find a pirated (no pun intended!) copy or a VHS copy.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you are looking for the stage version!"
1,unfair return policy,"this DVD will not play on 4 out of 5 DVD players that we tried, and when we did manage to play it we discovered it to be very grainy and of poor quality. Even so, it is non-returnable because we opened the package in our attempt to enjoy our purchase."
3,Wrong production.,"This is not the production of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" that was described in the Amazon information. I sought the coveted 1983 production with Angela Lansbury as the maid Jane. This production is another one which employed Patricia Routledge. I returned it unopened."
2,Historical value but limited playing capability,Product will not play on a Blu-Ray disc player. Had to play it on my laptop. Still -- it is historically a gem to see Patricia Routledge in this role captured on film.
4,Italian Charm--Jane Austen,The charm is of course smaller than pictured. It is fairly detailed for such a tiny link charm. I like it.
2,Confusing and difficult,This was the required text for a gradate course in buckling that I took. It's kind of a mess all over the place. Uses whatever method he sees fit for a particular problem but little explanation why. I didn't get much out of this book except for a few solutions that I needed. Buy Galambos's book instead even though it's more expensive.
1,Bad luck or bad quality control,"I bought this frame and it came on time and everything was okay until I try to put a picture of my little one in and found out that those rotatable holders on the back is all broken and comes of easily. Hey, maybe is my bad luck but I would buy this."
3,god kings Video by Philip Gardiner,"Once again Philip Gardner has managed to ruin a perfectly good idea by making a crappy, low budget movie with the worst sound quality I have ever heard in my life. It even made my brand new flat screen sound staticy, with that being said this has no bearing at all on the author Hugh Montgomery's work and I give Hugh Montgomery a 10 and a bravo! As far as philip garder and his reality productions go, he needs to find a new career or a new sound man. And He needs to turn down the loud background music so you can hear the author speak."
3,Genealogy of Jesus,"This is pretty interesting from a historical and religious perspective. Retired Belgrade Prof. Of Applied Sciences, Hugh Montgomery talks with Philip Gardiner about the process of tracing the lineage of Jesus back through the Norman Conquest, and how he personally became interested in the subject when he was doing his own family's genealogy."
3,Solid research,"The genealogy of Jesus is something you can access pretty much anywhere, just look online. But this DVD presents good, solid research without huge leaps in logic, and it presents it in an entertaining, neat form. The expert on the subject is trustworthy, not just some nut on the internet. I feel like I gained a lot from this film."
1,Series of Movie trailers for other movies,This is not a documentary on the God Kings Book. It starts talking with the author and not very well shot because most of the time the camera isn't on the guys face when he is speaking. Then it goes into a blurb about the real documentary and after that it handles other documentaries that the guy made. It ends with a supposed snipit of a TV show that was made by him and aired?
4,beautiful photos,"I bought this book for myself after I discovered a hidden love of flower gardening. The photos are so colorful and beautiful and they've really helped me choose which flowers to add to my garden this year. The sturdy magazine-like paperback with plastic cover is durable, and not to mention water-resistant (at least the cover). I suggest using the index to find particular flowers unless you are very familiar with botanical names. The plants are listed alphabetically by botanical name, not by common name. This is a good starting book for beginner flower gardeners- it sort of reads like the back of a seed packet. The book looks small, but by keeping each plant description short but informative, they've really paked a lot of information into it."
2,Important Literature in the Ruins,"I am sorry to say that the Kindle edition of this book requires proof-reading and correction. I have no explanation for how such an important piece of the classic literature on meditation could have been treated so lightly, but perhaps there still remains the possibility that the error shall be rectified. Kindle? What say you?"
3,Deeply satisfying,"Good information and fittingly esoteric. Would like to have seen more analysis. Vast amount of information that addresses some of the issues with Qi Gong, although it isn't called that in the book."
5,The Secret of the Golden Flower: A Chinese Book of Life,This book interprets Tao in the words and mind of western culture with amazing clarity !Its the best I have read with out losing the reader with concepts and subject matter that is difficult to comprehend with out it being explained poorly which other books written about Tao have a habit of doing .I personally think that other authors have used the saying Tao is unexplainable with words as a way to justify there crappy interpretations and writings then again that could be said about every religion on the planet ! but I wont say that at risk of offending some religious nut as even Jesus didn't get away with that with out coping nine inch nails.
5,great product,"At first I wasn't sure this was going to help me out, my problem has always been that people tell me I don't have good inuniciation when I sing. After watching it several times I must of got it because my band tells me they can actually understand what I'm saying. Wayd Johnson, Tulsa OK"
2,Slouch and Breathe,"We learn a lot about breathing. I'm a complete novice and have never taken choir and have never sung in public. However, I like to sing-a-long to opera (at home when no one is listening.) I bought this DVD because I wanted to have some official training before joining the choir at church. My husband thinks I can sing--but then so do all of those parents of the deluisonal folks trying out for American Idol, right? I expected voice exercises and actual INSTRUCTION -- But that didn't happen. Instead, it is full of self-promotion and name dropping of famous clients. I found a much better DVD --the Berkley Method, at a local music store and I recommend it."
4,Works like it is supposed to,"VW Cabriolet application. The pump arrived quickly and at this price, it was hard to beat for convenience and timing. Doesn't everybody that owns an old Volkswagen know you have to be patient with these cars anyway?All the parts needed were included although you will need hoseclamps if you need to cut of the stock crimped style clamps."
4,Internal Fuel Pump,"Fuel pump was installed into a VW Fox. Was easy to install and worked perfectly. Takes about 2 hours to install as you have to take out the back seat of car to access fuel tank. I would recommend you have a full tank of gas, as its less explosive than a empty tank. Be careful of any static electricity, as you are dealing in Gas.."
2,Cold Ending,"I agree with Penelope...lots of built up suspense (partly due to his repetitive style) with no satisfactory conclusion!! I can't stop thinking about this novel, but mainly because I feel so let down by the ending. I'm off now to try a Graham Greene novel as suggested by Penelope :}"
3,Amram's dark Americana unearthed on CD,"Using a harmonic vocabulary from the post-Alex North school of film composition, David Amram provides a nice balance of modern effects, rich string writing, and scene support. Unfortunately he also has the tendency to let his ideas run away with him, forcing the sound engineer to blanch back the volume on Amram's bold crescendos simply to allow for the dialogue to be heard. On the CD though the sound rings true, with no interruption from Frank Sinatra, and with very little audio analog hiss."
3,"Nice, but I dont know that its worth the price","Maybe I'm out of touch with the pricing of these, but they are pleather. Nothing really special about the quality of them. If a regular binder costs $5 then is it worth it to pay $25 for these? Well, they have a nice zipper and the pleather cover is nice, so I will keep them, but not sure that they are worth $25. Maybe $15."
5,Binder,"This was exactly what I was looking for and much cheaper thru Amazon. It is good quality and has the appearance of leather. Never been disappointed with Amazon,"
2,Eh,I would recommend going down to Walmart and buying this same product for a much cheeper price. That is the quality you're getting here. The inside liner is plastic. The metal is cheep. You don't get your money's worth with this one.
3,It is big,"I liked the quality of that ring binder, however, it is quite big in size and I didn't realize that while ordering it. I wish it had handles - this product would have been totally perfect then."
4,This is IT!,I bought this because it looked like the one Det. Bobby Goren of LO-CI uses. Very useful when I interrogate suspects. He he he.
4,Good.. sad....,"i'm not sure how to describe the book.. i liked all the parts when Sam was remembering Jules and how hard it was and stuff, and how she and Sandra remained close.. i just didn't like Mona at all:S..overall a good read, a real tearjerker too.."
3,Interesting Read,"This book is a sequel.Though I did not read the first title I was not lost about the characters.This book gave catch up so I understood what happen in the previous book. Samantha is getting over the death of her friend Julianna. During her sadness she meets a new friend named Mona in summer school.Mona let her feel alive again and they end up living together.But as time draws near for Juliana birthday Samantha goes into a withdrawn state and neither her mother or Mona knows what to do. An interesting read though I do not like books that have death and sadness in them it was not bad. They are also very diverse characters in this book Mona's mom who is bi-polar who sometimes goes after Mona, Samantha starts dating Noah who is model who is very narcissitic and they ended up breaking up and Daniel who dates Mona and ended up breaking up with her."
3,Not Really Impressd,"I read A TIME FOR DANCING over the summer,and recieved this book for Christmas.I read it,and frankly - It did not live up to my standards.While the plot was fairly good,and the first book was summed up well,I didn't feel the emotions of the characters nearly as much as I did with the first."
2,meh,"I bought this for the MaryJanice Davidson story because her short in Secrets Volume 6 was extremely sexy. This one, not so much and nothing else in the book is particularly memorable."
2,Okay,"Reading this book wasn't the most terrible thing, but it was also not the most exciting, fascinating, etc. I thought that the actual storyline was a good one, but it left the reader wanting. The sterotypical ""bad guy,"" Creedath, was just that: sterotypical. And, the big fight scene that you just keep waiting for never happens! He is so easily overpowered in the end that his whole bad guy persona just gets blasted into oblivion. The heroin of the story never does do anything remarkable either: sure, she fights like a man, wears mens clothing, but geez, how many times have we read this? Make her do something that makes the reader say ""wow."" Also, her romance wasn't all that exciting either; it was a very typical love/hate relationship, and just left you waiting for something more to happen.But, on a good note, the storyline is an interesting concept in itself, and I would like to see it further explored in future books."
2,More like a script less like a book.,"After reading this novel, I felt as if I had just looked over someone's script, rather than a full length novel. The characters never really leapt out at me, or even cause me to care about them in any way. The villain was a rough draft of any villian out there.Overall there were some great ideas I wished had been explored in more depth, however by the end I was happy to get it over with and move on to something else. Feels like it was published before it was finished.Much like the other reviewer I hate to bash a new authors first work, but this was flat and needed more depth throughout its entirety. I find this more to be a problem with Avon's Editor than the author."
3,Too much bashing! Not enough unbiased information!,"This book goes over tricks that a small percentage of dealers still use. Not that informative. Some interesting tidbits, but I'd spend my money elsewhere."
3,Matta- Seldom Recognised Genius,"Matta did huge paintings that combined the energy of Abstract Expressionism with the weirdness of Surrealism and a thorough knowledge of color, composition, form and perspective, yet this is the only book I have seen dedicated to him. It's not a big coffee-table book like he deserves, but the paintings look good. I would have preferred to see more paintings and fewer drawings."
5,Like a refreshing river--read it!,"Essays and journalism and very good footnotes deal with starvation in Europe, prevention of literature, Gandhi, an attempt to form an organization which would deal with issues like expelling people from their homes, people forced back to Soviet Russia, and much more including civil liberities for anarchists."
4,"A little dry, but very insightful",This book does a great job of showing the differences between predominately white churches and predominately black churches. A real eye-opener for this Caucasian ministry professional. I learned a lot!
1,bed shampoo bath,"This is a fine item, but without some way to bring water to it and to drain it, you are talking about needing a pail and two people to transfer the water safely."
5,AND MAY I INTRODUCE TO YOU...MEET THE BEATLES!,"This book is a treat anybody would love. There are a plethora of delightful photographs that will make readers, from the inveterate fans to those just becoming familiar with the Fab 4 feel as if they are ""meeting"" the Beatles.This author has a real flair for natural expression and the writing style is crisp and fresh. This is a book with something to offer everyone and I cannot recommend it highly enough. As the only Beatles' fan in my family, I've ""introduced"" many relatives to the wonderful phenomenon that was the Beatles!This one gets a stellar endorsement and an enthusiastic ""YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!"" from me! I love it!"
2,"Overdone photo ""memoir"" book","Freeman really doesn;t have a lot to say about either the Beatles or the photos he took of them...no professional insights on photography and no intriguing thoughts on the Beatles in the context of the British pop culture scene in the 1960's. Photos are nothing new beyond the album covers, nothing we haven't scene in Hoffman's, Gunther's, Benson's and even Beatle Biographies from Davies, Schaffner and Norman, etc.Don't waste your money - by Hoffman's or Lewisohn's chronicles book if you want nice photos, and more insightful text."
2,"Build , Operate,Transfer : Paving the Way for Tomorrow's Infrastructure",It is Useful for having General & History of BOT .
3,nice lights tho they are oh so blue,"These are nice little lights. The don;t have much light to them, and you'll definitely want to replace the stock batteries with some that have better legs per charge for sure. But they are nicely put together and charge up quickly. Oh, they have the traditional ""blue white"" color to their light. Not a warm white or a white light, but bluish to be surish."
3,A solid movie,"I am a major collector of John Le'Carre books and movies. My favorite book is ""A Call for the Dead"" which is where this film finds it plot. I could accept the changes to the story to make it play for Hollywood but I did not see the point or reason to alter the plot the way they did. I could more or less accept the casting choices and character portrayal but I have to admit I was not pleased with most of the casting choices nor their portrayal. I found the soundtrack to be very intrusive and almost over-powering. I think Quincy Jones was a poor choice to prepare a soundtrack for an English ""Spy"" film. Yet with all of these seemingly negative comments I have to say that overall it was a solid film. Well directed and acted (minus the soundtrack of course). My problem is that I am a die-hard Le'Carre fan but I have to say that If it cannot be perfect, this would be close enough."
2,A Deadly Disappointment,Over the top acting by Mason and an idiotic ending. Not the best screen adaptation of a Le Carre novel.
4,Great sounding Headphones!,"I don't use headphones that often, so I decided to try these out. I highly recommend these headphones if you're looking for great sound on a budget. The plastic is kinda cheap so be careful with them, but the sound quality is worth buying for this price."
2,Book not in great shape,"The description of the book had no mention of writing on the pages. There is some writing on a few pages. But, when the book is closed, there is a lot of scribbling on the page ends. I feel the book was overpriced for the condition. I have tried to contact the seller, but can't figure out how. I keep getting knocked into their customer reviews."
4,True Rock,"If you like good time rock,you will like this album,Brownsville Station is not very appreciated,but they were a very talented band."
2,Ehhh....,I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the DVD format is not user friendly. You can't forward from pose to pose. There aren't short or long workouts to choose from. It looks like a 70s video tape stuck on a disc. He also doesn't explain the poses very well and this dvd is definitely not for beginners. But if you have experience the different poses may be relavant to your own personal workout. I'm still can't decide if I want to return it or not. It's just not very appealing.
4,good product,have not had a chance to install this on my car due to work schedule. but product looks like its made of good material. being the oem product for my car i know its good quality. first time changing it since car rolled out the assembly line.
4,Wonderful Camera!,"I love this camera! It is easy to use, and the prints I have had developed have turned out beautifully. Clear, sharp images with beautiful color! I am delighted with this purchase and would recommend this camera with out reservation to anyone who is looking for a good quality SLR."
4,good camera,I think this is a fair price for this camera it is a good camera and can have many attachments to make it great! I recomend it!
4,Very versatile features! Clear picture!,"I purchased this unit for a motorhome and loved it because it had 3 power sources: 12V, 110V and a lithium battery.It's small and compact and has amazing features. Plug in TV Cable and you get a great picture.I still have lots of VHS tapes and players are getting scarce.This is a very solidly made little unit!"
1,A last resort,"The ""doctor"" has written many books on the subject. The only reason for him to do this is just to rake in the cash form people in need. The only people this book will help are those that would believe in the easter bunny. He does nothing but say that you have no pain or problems. Its all in your mind. About 180 pages that sounded to me he replays the same 20 over and over. I have no idea how he got any more books printed on the same thing. I figured I would spend the money before I jump off a bridge. Should have saved the money for the toll booth. How can sleep knowing that he takes advantage of desperate people."
5,This book changed my life!,"It's true. Since I was a teen-ager I had severe back pain, neck tension, etc. Although I have always kept active, it had become increasingly more difficult. I saw a chiropractor as often as 3 times a week, and though it helped tremendously, I had to keep going back if I wanted to be pain free.There were days when I would feel fine, and then there would be days when I had pain in my neck, my shoulders, my low back, my hips, my knees, and my jaw. I had headaches. Even when I felt good, after a few days, I would begin to feel panic--wondering when the pain would start in again. It always did.UNTIL I read this book.It sounds ridiculous, but after seeing osteopaths, sports doctors, etc., a book held the key to my current state of wellness.Will it work for you?I don't know, but God, I reccomend this book to anyone. Try it."
5,Mind-Body Healing,"I would highly recommend this book to any back pain sufferer (or other pain, too). As a practicing doctor of chiropractic for the past 20+ years, I have seen every cause of back pain there is. I have also used a mind-body healing technique for the past 12+ years in my practice, and I can say without any doubt that everybody has at least SOME mind (stress, emotion, memory) connection to their condition. Once this is removed (or reduced), healing can occur much more rapidly. I have used very similiar techniques as Doctor Sarno, with greaat results! I give his book to many of my patients for another approach to healing and also get very good results from them just reading and applying the concepts."
5,A follow up &#65533; and a response to the warnings,"It's been over a year now since I read this book and posted my review and I'm still 100% pain free. I now also know several other people who have been cured by this book. I wanted to respond to some of the bad reviews and warnings that seem to be cropping up lately. Most of these people distort the information given in the book (I get the feeling that some of these people haven't read the book or have never suffered from severe back pain). I say read the book and decide for yourself. Half the problem is misinformation and fear. These reviews only contribute to the problem. If you've already tried everything else (like I had), what do you have to loose?"
5,Body Pains Cured in 2 Weeks,"I heard about this book from a friend after 18 months of constant back, shoulder, neck and arm pains. After holding on to the book for 2 months, I had to return it so I was forced to start reading it. Half way through the book ALL...YESS ALL of my my pains were gone...GONE! The mind plays tricks on you my friend and until you can control the vibes your brain is giving you, pain will continue to dominate your life. The key to being successful after reading this book (or book on tape) is simply to keep an open mind and believe. It's literally all between your ears. This book has helped me and several of my friends. It's a must have if you're living in pain. As the book states, be sure to be checked out medically prior to committing to this book."
5,Should be required reading,"I read this book around 10 years ago and have not had back pain since. I was very skeptical at first, but was absolutely amazed by the information in this book. If I could just get everyone with back pain to read this!! I recently suggested this book to my boss, who was becoming more and more immobile from a ""bad back"". Well, he read the book and recently told me that it cured him! I now recommend this book to anyone who has back problems."
3,I HAD SURGERY INSTEAD,"I heard about this book, saw all the rave reviews, and decided to try Dr. Sarno's techniques. I read the book and tried to do what he said, but found that it didn't work. I ended up feeling like kind of a failure, like I'm not sophisticated enough to control my pain with my mind. Anyway, I opted for surgery, had my L5 S1 disc removed (herniated), and have felt like a million bucks ever since. Don't be afraid of the surgery - it's not as bad as people tell you and much better than the pain. Having said all this, it can't hurt to try his techniques - it obviously works for lots of people. Just don't beat yourself up if you can't do it."
4,Ending years of back pain,"Using the information and tactics in Dr. Sarno's book, my lower back is much much improved over what it used to be. I never realized that the mind played such a role in healing the body. This is a ""must read"" for anyone suffering back and neck pain."
5,Life changing!,"After trying 3 or 4 orthopedists, chiropractors, physical rehabilitation, etc. the pain was still there. I couldn't move.Then I read ""THE BOOK"". In a few weeks I was free of pain. It's not magic, boodoo or a trick. It is just science at its best. My Bible..."
1,Worthless,"The book works great if you don't have an injury, ie, it is in your head. Unfortunately I ""Really"" have a herniated disc. It's funny how back injuries seem to be blown off this way, when other injuries are not! Anyways, if you are not injured but think you are, buy this book! If you really are injured, don't waste your time money etc. It is an imaginary cure for a real injury!"
3,What's Next?!,"Sarno's book helped me understand the cause of my back pain, but I was left with no clear steps to take to get rid of the pain. Rapid Recovery from Back and Neck Pain gave me the information and steps I needed to get rid of the pain for good. It would be nice if somehow the two books could be integrated to make it easier for the readers to get all the information they need in one book!"
1,Not helpful and false information,"This book was not helpful to me at all.The author also lacks understanding of basic scientific principles and facts. The author completely ignores proven facts and replaces them with unproven, unresearched ideas!!"
4,just what the Dr ordered,"My Dr. suggested this book, because I have Myfacial pain syndrome. The book is great in that I could learn more about what alis me. I was surprised on how fast it arrived. I am glad I got the book."
2,An advertisement in the shape of a book,"If you don't know anything about psychosomatic pain, you might learn a thing or two in this book. However, if you are looking for a method to really treat your back pain, you will not find it here. This book is just a teaser.In short, it says ""Hey, I can prove that back pain can be cured without surgery or medication in 90% of the times. I have a very efficient method to do it. Come to my office and I will help you"".Finally, even if you are just only looking for a easy interesting read, this book is also disappointing. It is poorly written and has no clear structure. It feels as a big mix of quotes about scientific studies and anecdotes about patients who got better using the authors amazing methods.The reason I don't give just one star is because - no matter how bad the book - it gets you thinking."
5,BUY THIS BOOK,"This book is incredible. It literally has changed my life. I suffered from terrible back pain for approx. 6 years. It was getting worse and worse and I was at my wits end. I tried chiropratic sessions and massage to no avail. The day I purchased this book I could hardly walk. Literally hours after reading I felt better, not perfect but better. A few days later I was much better. Now several months later I'm just about 100% cured and have been doing any physical activity I want pain free. Anyone who puts this book down is a liar and probably has an agenda(doctors,chiropracters, etc.)I can't recommend this enough, it saved my life. thank you dr. sarno."
5,Miracle,"This book and what it teaches saved my life!!!! For years I took pain medication and for years I was diagnosed by chiropracters and neurologists who helped me little, except for the huge medical bills and addiction to medication. I used this book to get rid of daily migraines and back pain. Dr. John Sarno has the answer most of us are looking for."
5,The proof is in the pudding - it works!,"I have had back pain since I was 11 yrs old and just celebrated my 58th - but this one was pain free, thanks to the Sarno book. Even while I was reading it, my pain went away. So did my acid stomach (no more living on Tums) and my seborrhea! I have resumed physical activity that used to cause extreme pain for days. And now when pain returns, I know what to do about it, and it works instantly! Do yourself a favor, and work on the causes of back pain, not the sypmtoms."
5,Dr. Sarno saved me from a life of chronic back pain,"I had been experiencing low back pain for 6 years, and especially a lot of pain on the sides of my back, so much that I couldn't walk properly or stand or sit for a long time without pain. By chance I saw Dr. Sarno on 20/20 TV show and hoped he could help me. I ordered the book right away which was easy on Amazon.com, and I have been reading it for about a week. It is hard to believe that I am almost completely free of pain right now. Thanks to Dr. Sarno for improving so many people's lives."
1,Dangerous insulting drivel,"This quote pretty much sums up the book: ""Neck, shoulder and back pain syndromes are not mechanical problems to be cured by mechanical means. They have to do with people's feelings, their personalities and the vicissitudes of life."" So, if you can be brainwashed into believing this statement, then this book is for you. Personally, I got insulted and outraged by these sorts of statements that are liberally sprinkled throughout every page of this book."
1,Worthless book that could have been summarized in 3 pages,"Dr. Sarno should have giving his ideas to a writer or someone that could easily translate his methods to plain English. He used superior English words to describe truly simple concepts. My only conclusion is that he wants to sound smart being an MD. This book is seriously useless and a waste of time. One can get the jist of the concept (which is that muscular pain might be associated and triggered by deep emotional stress, so look at what is causing that), in a 3 page flyer. This book is a total money waster."
2,"Kat, PT Spine therapist","I deal with many different type of people of all ages with many different type of injuries. I am always on the look out for new books on the subject of spinal pain. While this book talks about the pain and how the mind tricks you into pain rather than just being in phyiscal pain, the author does not offer sound advice to active people trying to improve themselves and thier condition as far as being for the lay person,I disagree, the reader needs a strong back ground to understand what the author is trying to say.I strongly recommend instead of this book is the BackSmart Fitness Plan by Dr. Adam Weiss, this doctor takes the subject matter of back and neck pain not as a lession in why you have back pain rather he teaches you how to over come your pain and how to get into shape without inuring yourself. A very good book for anyone of any fitness level and age."
2,"Information good, but how to heal? Not so much.","Healing Back Pain was highly informative, but it could have been more helpful if skills and strategies to reduce the pain were more concretely addressed."
2,Content great but Cheapo Reprint book,"The content of the book is 4-Star, but the book is a cheap reprint. It is very small and the font is very small; paper quality is low. The chore of reading the book is annoying, unlike the earlier printing. Holding the tiny book and reading the tiny font gave me TMS and pain in my lower back...Sarno's work is excellent and helpful -- I know from experience with back pain and conventional treatments (that did not work).This is not the first time that I purchased an Amazon book reprint that was inferior. In the future, I will confirm size, font, and original content (one book I purchased from Amazon was a 'shortened' version of a good book)."
5,Healing Back Pain,Very informative book. Interesting concept -- very helpful. It's great to ease pain without medicine. The Doctor who wrote the book shows lots of research and lots of information.
5,A Must Read!,Anyone who suffers from chronic pain should read this and all of Dr. Sarno's books. As should all doctors and health care practitioners.
1,Not buying the hype...,"Give me a break! Gentle exercise, massage and learning proper biomechanics is working. Believing there are emotions I am not addressing just doesn't make sense to me. I don't hold anger in. Either I journal, meditate, or read somebody the riot act when I am angry! I don't give it a chance to do me harm. As far as I'm concerned, I can't see how unacknowledged anger in my life is causing me back pain. I seem to be one of those who don't fit the profile of the fuming, seething individual who has emotional turmoil and indeed has lost touch with his/her emotions. For that readership, I guess they give the book five stars.Save your money and go buy a nice journal instead. Do you a world of good."
5,Truly Worth the Read,"This solved my son's ruptured back issues. Highly recommend for those with unending, unsolveable back issues. All medicine is common sense married to science and this book achieves this blend."
5,Excellent book!!!,This book changed my life forever as well as the way I look at pain in all forms. I suffered from many different TMS imperatives throuout my life and Dr. Sarno has lead me out of those dark places. I wrote a book about my journey through TMS and I hope it helps many people as well.Kevin Jarviskevinrobertjarvis.com
5,This changed my life!,"I'm a 40 year old male that suffered from lower back pain for the better part of 20 years. This audio book cured my lower back pain after 2 weeks!!! With that said, I'm the perfect patient that Dr. Sarno describes in his audio book, often stressed and my back flare ups always occurred after stressful events (parties, holidays, work issues...). I would have 2-3 major pain episodes per year lasting 3-4 weeks. This program taught me to let go of the tension in my lower back and help me realize that I had nothing structurally wrong with my lower back. Although my back still gets sore, I can mentally stop the soreness from turning into a full blown lower back pain. Thank you Dr. Sarno!Watch the 20/20 segment that they did about Dr. Sarno and his treatment, this convinced me to buy the cd's.WOW, WOW, WOW! Still pain free after one year."
5,This really works,"I came down with a bad bout of sciatica last fall of 2007. I was in excrutiating pain. Pain started in my buttocks and radiated down to my knee cap. I could not sit, lay down, or sleep. I tried everything. I went to the chiropractor and had the electrodes, massage therapy, adjustments, acupuncture nothing helped. I went to the PC DR and was prescribed steriods and an MRI. The MRI showed a slipped disk on my left side note my pain was on the right. I researched the net to try to find an explaination of why this was happening and what I could do. My pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 10. A colleage shared the idea of this book with me. I went home watched the DVD and then read the book. My pain subsided in a matter of weeks. The self talk explained in the book was what really worked for me. Dr Sarno I thank you for relieving me of my excrutiating pain and allowing me to return to a normal life. I now have the knowledge of what lies beneath this pain that is 100% real."
5,Search no more - this is the real deal,"After wasting hundreds of dollars on chiropractors over the last 10 years, I was urged to buy this book by a friend, another back pain sufferer. People, there is so much we don't yet know about the human mind - this stuff works! My pain started to decrease within days of reading about the disorder known as TMS. For others it may take longer but for 98% of the population (as the good Dr. Sarno says) will benefit from learning about TMS. The remaining 2% may need further psychotherapy, as explained in the book, however, do not despair! $15 or less is all you need to ""fix"" you. Learn about TMS and conquer it."
5,holistic approach,"This book is a boon for those who believe in the mind-body connection. It's a quick read through the arguments & evidence in support of the approach, and has several pages of helpful, practical advice."
4,A review of the mind's role on causing back pain,"This is a very readable book on the way the mind can affect real pain - in the back. It is very readable and convincing. It offer that stress and repressed anger can actually physically constrict nerve impules and its related affects in ways that cause the lower back pain that affects millions of Americans. The key to Dr. Sarno's remedy - and this is the key to being able to believe it and apply it - is to confront the psychogenic origin of the pain and drop all other therapies and aids. In other words, no more physical therapy, braces, exercises or adjustments since these are crutches that preclude confronting the mental origin of the problem. His argument is convincing and worth reading - but as one who suffers from chronic back problems, its an awful tough call to quit the physical remedy in lieu of the mental one.Nonetheless, its worth a read because it does provide insight whether one takes on Dr. Sarno's remedy or not."
5,"Six years out, and still cured!","Twenty years of back pain, usual horror story with docs, etc. Read Healing Back Pain about five times, six years ago. This book has revolutionalized my life. Back to weight lifting, sprinting, carrying the groceries, lifting boulders! Have told several hundred people about the book over the years. Have yet to meet a single person who has ever heard of it, or the concepts involved. What a shame, what needless pain. What an enormous waste of medical resources. Skyrocking medical insurance premiums are necessary to pay for the useless therapy billed for so very efficiently. If Sarno's books were handed out by every chiropractor, GP and back doctor, the nations medical costs would plummet. Never has a book cured so much for so little, or been so ignored by the money machine of the back pain business."
1,It didn't work for me.,"My review never appeared here when I posted it two months ago, so I'm posting it again in hopes it will appear this time.I read this book and faithfullyfollowed everything it suggested, and it didn't work for me at all. In such cases, the book suggests that the reader should consult with a psychologist to see if their back pain might be due to unresolved psychological issues -- I did that and it didn't work for me either. Several years later, my back pain is just as bad, and it has since been diagnosed as fibromyalgia.Although Dr. Sarno's techniques may work for some people, they certainly don't work for everyone."
3,Pain Free for 6 Months,"Reading this book cured my back pain and changed my life! When my back was ""out"", the pain was so severe that the muscles in my buttock contracted so tightly that I walked with a limp. I read the book, accepted the scientific plausibility of the theory, and now I'm cured. I haven't had an episode in over six months. I'm no longer afraid to lift heavy objects. I engage in much more physical activity. I bought a dozen copies of the book and gave them to the my friends and relatives who suffer from back pain."
5,Great Book! Answered my questions.,"I was suffering from chronic pain in my back, legs, knees, feet, neck, arms, and hands, and was almost completely disabled. Healing Back Pain answered the many questions I had about my condition. Combining guidelines provided by Dr. Sarno with techniques used by Olympic athletes, I was able to design a nine-step repid recovery program that allowed me to improve immediately and recover within four days. My story is detailed in Rapid Recovery from Back and Neck Pain: A Nine-Step Recovery plan and serves as another testimony to the accuracy of Dr. Sarno's diagnosis."
1,Complete non-sense..Blame the Patient mentality.,"Here we go again...doctors blaming patients when they don't have answers. I guessthe ""stress"" that was told to my Grandfather by 4 different doctors that ultimately turned out to be bone cancer was TMS. And I guess the Pancreatic Cancer that my Grandma died of must have been TMS also. Geez, if they only would have known Dr Sarno. They could have lived a much longer life. Also, I guess the millions suffering from toxic poisoning (MS, FM, CFS etc...) are really just stressed. What a quack. They need to take this guy's medical license away."
3,Dissapointed a bit,Not what I was expecting and not very helpful for me- my personality and specific needs
2,It's all in your mind,Save your time and money. Serious back-pain is usually not cause entirely by the mind. Take **lots** of rest (nothing more serious than walking) and you'll heal. I read the book and kept waiting for some gems of wisdom which never came.
2,"lee,",I think when doctors tell me it's all in my mind suffering from chroinic back pain-I felt hopless then picking up this book made me think there was a connection to the mind and pain- I felt the author spent most of thier time trying to tell me it's all in my head and there was no phyical problems? My MRI showed otherwise!
1,Don't waste your money,"This is one of the worst books on back pain I have ever read. This guy has no medical knowledge which becomes clear in the first chapter yet he poo poo's the whole medical profession . Basically he is saying that all the medical science and study over the years have done nothing to advance the care for back pain . Yet he has no background or basis toake this claim. And the gist of his book is that it's all in your head, so just evaluate your thoughts and change your thinking and your back pain will disappear. While this may help for some and I do believe in the power of the mind, it is ludicrous to throw out the notion that real injury and pathology lead to pain . And that the solution may be physical and mechanical. This author just loses his credibility with me by dismissing all ideas but his own. Not toe room it is poorly written."
1,inaccurate info,"every ailment is part physical, mental, and chemical- in differing proportions for each person. dr sarno carefully ""screens"" his patients.clearly they are those who have a larger mental/emotional component.i have first hand experience of meeting one of dr sarno's patient for whom his program was unsuccessful.after treating his injured disc, he is now pain free.sarnos explanations for why back pain can not be from the common physical diagnoses is full of mistakes.his understanding of neurology appears limited.if you would like some real answers try to get your hands on stuart mcgill's low back disorders,evidence-based prevention and rehabilitation.when you are through please send your copy to dr. sarno. if he truely cares, he'll read it."
1,256 reviews CAN be wrong,"I believe the other reviewers are honestly inaccurate in their assessment this book is and could be beneficial to anyone with real pain cause by aging bodies, injury or sorts. I am always amazed how many people out there are cool aid people (GUANA). I mean any disrespect but I don't respect the majority of opinions (Pro book review) for obvious reason especially since the cant explain the reasoning for the pain relief besides to name it TMJ.I wish all pain weary information seeker the best of luck but I believe it take more than this books approach."
1,Very Dangerous....potential benefits of book less than Risk,"Ordinarilly, I would never give even a poorly written book one star. And although this book is fairly well written, I would actually give it negative stars if at all possible. Dr Sarno makes the mistake of strongly suggesting that virtually all back and joint disorders are the result of mind driven oxygen deprivation...resulting from stress. This, while true for many, is also likely equally untrue for many more. However, if you follow his advice and try to physically perform as though your ailments were imaginary, as he seems to suggest, you could very very possibly turn an already damaging condition into a crippling one. If, for example, you decide to lift heavy objects like you used to, operating under the premise that you shouldn't give in to the ""illusion of injury"" that your mind is creating, then you could very well rupture discs, tear weak ligaments etc...."
3,"Great background info, but not enough about healing","Howard Stern has talked about this book for years and I've always been interested. I finally picked it up after a neighbor with severe back problems had read the book and rid himself of his pain. I think Sarno does a great job explaining TMS and linking that pain back to your mind (and not some injury). I was extremely disappointed because the entire book is spent discussing TMS and that mind-body link. He does not go into detail about how you can go about healing. Sarno really goes into no detail at all unless you count his advice to ""talk some sense into your brain"". My hope is that his latest book will go into more detail."
4,A Different Perspective for Pain,"If you have a ""bad back"" Dr. Sarno's book is worth reading. There's an emotional component to all forms of chronic pain, and this book will shed light on how much thought is a factor. Some people think he's saying that you're to blame for your pain or that it's all ""in your head,"" but this book is just giving you a different way to look at it. Very enlightening! I recommend it to all my clients with chronic pain.Anita Boser, LMP, CHP, author ofRelieve Stiffness and Feel Young Again with Undulation"
1,A bunch of balony,"I have had a re-accuring back injury for the past three months (keeps flaring up) so I purchased this book and read it. While I understand that holding tention in one's body can cause problems, he doesn't address that you really can have an injury. Also, he says that there is no right or wrong way to lift, bend or move and that there are no exercises that help. He says that all the pain is emotional pain. Well, there is something called PHYSICS and you CAN move in the wrong way to injure a muscle, tendon, ligament or even cause a herniated disc. Not to mention that am pretty in touch with my emotions. I don't hold a lot of stuff in. The book just seemed liked a bunch of balony with no basis in science. I would not recomment spending the money. Go see a good specialist."
2,Book is very myopic,"Book has a catchy title but way too simplistic in approach to low back pain..being mainly of a psychologic origin. Yes, there is an input albeit large from fear and anxiety when one has the low back pain but just psyching yourself to have a better day does not do the trick to permanently relieve for most people. His recommendation to stop all physical medicine modalities like acupuncture, chiropractic, physical therapy is total bunk. This stuff rocks."
5,Healing Back Pain..Mind Body Connection by Sarno,Healing Back Pain: The Mind-Body ConnectionI have purchased several of these books for friends. This book has really good information regarding back pain and a different way of dealing with it. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has back pain and thinks that only surgery or pain pills will work!
4,Excellent description and thesis,"This is Sarno's second book on back pain, andit's much better than the first, ""Mind Over Back Pain"" as it offers steps on how to rid your body of the pain. Worth reading and trying if you have pain and don't want surgery."
5,If there ever was a Book of The Century....this is it!,"After suffering from debilitating back pain for over 12 years my wife convinced me to read Dr. Sarno's book (She had heard about it while reading one of Andrew Weil's books).It has now been nearly two years since I've read and studied the book (5 times to date) and two years that I've been pain-free. I'm now back to doing all the things I thought I'd forever have to give up.If you have any kind of back pain.....READ THIS BOOK!!!! It seems a bit far fetched, but what Dr. Sarno says is absolutely, with out a doubt, TRUE!!!I wish someday I could meet him in person to say thank you from the bottom of my heart!"
1,Anti-depressants may cause back pain,"This book was recommended to me during a time I suffered from severe back and neck pain. The pain went on for over a year. I went to see many doctors and physical therapists, and none of them mentioned the side-effect connection. Finally, a massage therapist brought it to my attention that the anti-depressants I was taking was causing the pain. I stopped them, and my pain went away. It blows me away that Dr. Sarno has written a book without considering any of the many, many causes of back pain. He is doing his readers a real disservice. Doctors in general need to be much, much aware of side-effects. Any one with back pain, who is on anti-depressants, should consider whether these drugs could be causing the pain. Of course the drugs may be extremely important to one's overall health, but side effects should be taken into account."
2,Too narrow minded of a view,"I understand that sometimes back pain can be in your mind, but to attribute every type of back pain to always being in your head is a little far fetched."
4,What finally healed my back pain.,"I have had back pain for years and avoided one of my favorite activities, golf, because of that. This book put back pain in the proper context. It is often associated with psychological issues and when you realize that, the pain improves dramatically. I now have little or no back pain and when I do get the pain, it improves far more quickly than before. I am a physician and I know that low back pain is one of the most common problems we see. This approach will help thousands of back pain sufferers. Thank you, Dr. Sarno!"
5,Mind Over Matter,"As my pains had shifted around for years from migranes, to anxiety to carpal tunnel to now my back without any provoking injuries to speak of, I thought this might work and it did. He does indeed tell you how to instruct your brain literally to think otherwise and it works. Simple and great!"
5,this book saved my life!,"after years of searching for a cure, who would think that 30 pages into a book I'd be cured. Thank you Dr. Sarno!"
3,"Interesting theory, but I am skeptical of Sarno's theory","interesting theory of chronic back pain. The author's theory of CBP is very different from today's mainstream medical theory. I would love to believe that Sarno's theory is true, because it make it easier for me to overcome my Chronic pain problems. Unfortunately,my personal experience and my own reasoning tell me that Sarno's main theory is probably flawed. On a positve note, the book does mention and expain the important role psychology plays in chronic pain (however i don't believe it to the extent that Sarno claims) which will give the reader empowering insights that emotions play in chronic pain."
1,Summary: It hurts because your ticked off about something,"Your back pain is a psychologically manifested from your problems in life...at least that is what John E. Sarno is trying to convince you to believe. Actually, he has probably gotten a lot of publicity because it give's psychiatrists the ability put people on psychotropic drugs for life. Yes the fact that you are probably over worked and underpaid is probably why you are ticked off and you have back pain. This book completely disregards the fact that people weren't made to sit in front of a computer 8 hours a day. Face it John Sarno- Our back's are messed up from an injury- too much work and not enough time to re-create and exercise."
5,Healed my life,"I had had sever back pain for 4 years. I hurt it on the job just lifting something and for 4 years it was horrible. I had 2 mri's physical therapists, acupuncture, spinal decompression which pulled my body apart, everything I could think of. It was horrible. I thought horrible thoughts about why i should live anymore with this horrible pain day to day. Then i finally read this book a friend gave to me on a subway platform. He was paralyzed in bed for weeks on end with back pain and he was 33 years old. I am 35. He read this boook and now is a regional cross-fit competitor.YOU have to do the work though. It all depends on you. If you believe in it it will work. It worked for me. I haven't had any pain in a year since I read it. I am running, lifting weights, pilates again, and my life is wonderful all because of this book. I didn't know if i wanted to go on living for a while because of this pain and this book actually i believe saved my life.its 6 bucks. what have you got to lose."
5,"If you fit the symptoms, this works!","I had read the original of this, Mind Over Back Pain, years ago and thought it didn't apply to me. I just read this updated book, Healing Back Pain, and WOW -- I fit the profile exactly -- pain in buttocks, small of back, top of shoulders, sides of neck, gastrointestinal symptoms, and anxiety and anger. Since reading this book, whenever something starts to hurt, I tell my brain to ""knock it off"" and breathe oxygen into the area (tension restricts oxygen). It works and I'm much healthier and out of pain these days!"
5,Changed my life,"I read this book several years ago now. I had been suffering quite severe back pain. There were times when I could not even work properly, and walking was too painful. Reading this book showed me what the other doctors had overlooked, and completely turned around the problem.I have since lent this book to other people with back pain and they have had similar success.I hesitate to write such a positive review as it might sound fake, but I am serious. If you have back pain you need to read this book."
2,"Valid, but leaves out the body to mind connection.","While I agree with the importance of the mind and emotions in influencing our health and well being, I think it is also important to remember the corollary. If the body is in need of attention, healing, repair, then treat the body! That may require help from someone outside ourselves. Often, if the body is re-set, so to speak, the mind follows suit. That's often as true as the mind being primary. So, don't get discouraged if Dr. Sarno's method doesn't work for you. Think also: Free the body of its stresses, which frees the mind, which helps the body. Sometimes you have to approach the problem from a different point on the loop."
5,experienced this first hand--it works,"Was told by a doctor that I would be paralyzed & incontinent over 3 years ago without emergency surgery--Dr. Sarno showed another way while still having me follow through to make sure that I was mediclly sound via conventional means--referred me to a neurologist who gave me ""the benefit of the doubt"" and here I am stronger than ever without any surgical procedures. It's hard and emotionally painful--but it works..."
5,Very inspirational and direct.,"I guess I shouldn't be suprised at how negative people are about a prescription that costs next to nothing. We have all been well trained to believe that you get what you pay for. As for me I have suffered from severe back pain since I was 17 years old, and it has become more frequent and debilitating over the years. I'm going to give Dr. Sarno's approach my best effort. Drugs, exercises, gravity beds, and an endless stream of advice from other sufferers has never done much, except to make me feel ever more disillusioned and hopeless. It has become blatently clear to me that the medical community knows next to nothing. One has only to observe the frequency with which they retract findings and treatments. The medical and pharmaceutical community would like all of us to continue filling their pockets, and they cannot endorse anyone who so rightly exposes their motives."
5,"Author Clark Night, William H. Bates Review, Book Video","Good Book. Teaches me to keep my mind off the tension in my neck. When get vertigo from the injury, I know I am still in repair, but no vertigo lately since stay away from those chiropractors that injured me. The way of thinking described in this book helps. I get the courage to go out, keep moving."
2,"Interesting, but not true for many back pain patients!!!!!","I found Dr. Sarno's book may be useful for patients with Chronic Fatique Syndrome and Fibromyalgia. However, many chronic back pain patients certainly do have structual damage. Such as Degenerative Disc Disease, severe Lordois, Stenosis and many other true structual conditions. I and my patients did not find his daily reminders particularily helpful, since their conditions were much more then TMS [ Tension Myositis Syndrome ]. Many doctors have their own opinions. He did not have the clinical studies to back up his hypothoses. Many of my colleques just do not agree with him. Sandra Ashley, M.D., PhD."
5,Addendum,"As an addendum to my earlier review endorsing Dr. Sarno's approach, you may read an extended excerpt of Rapid Recovery from Back and Neck Pain: A Nine-Step Recovery Plan, which includes research information on treatments that don't work, by visiting www.rapidrecovery.net."
1,Didn't help!!!,This book may help some people as I see it did in the customerreviews. As for me reading this book didn't help me at all.I wouldn't recommend it to a person that has been diagnosed witha herniated disc plus degenerative disc that I have especially ifyou have any pain down your leg!!!
1,This book has no useful information,"This book's basic premise that the pain is all in your mind is insulting and not helpful. If you are in crippling pain and it is due to a real condition such as a herniated disk then wishing the pain away is not going to work.My advice, bypass this book."
2,For Skeptics Only,"Despite the inference contained within the title, this book has painfully few words directly applicable to how the reader may address his/her own back pain. It is definitely not for the reader who is seeking a ""how to"" book. Rather this book is directed toward the reader or practicianer who does not believe that the mind has an influence on the physical experience of pain, and/or the reader who wishes to review the author's model candidates of those whose pain may originate in the mind. If you are a non-believer, this book just may be for you. If you are already a believer, prepare to be bombarded with a sufferably heavy dose of redundant justifications and patient stories aimed soley to convince the reader that the mind does influence the body."
1,tere may be another answer for you....,"Some of you may have what I have and it's called PYRIFORMIS SYNDROM. The muscle is trapping the sciatic nerve. A test can be done to diagnose this painful problem. Dr. Sarno discounts this information completely. His methods did work for me, but never more than a few hours at a time. I had no life,just pain down my left leg and it never moved anywhere else for four full months, 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week."
3,"ok, checking It out","I love the stern show, Mr stem talked about this, and I actually purchased twice. Twenty, twenty, twenty twenty, twenty, twenty twenty"
3,Little Witch's Big Night,"This children's book is about a little witch who has to stay home on Halloween for being too good. When three trick-or-treaters come to her door asking for treats, Little Witch doesn't have any treats, so she gives them a ride on her broomstick. This book was well-written and well-illustrated, but I thought it was a little boring. Written by Deborah Hautzig and Illustrated by Marc Brown, an okay book to read, but not one I'd want to buy."
5,Another Little Witch success!,"Little Witch's Big Night (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)In this story Little Witch was too good and her mother punishes her by making her stay home on Halloween night when the rest of the witches go out. She is sad but three little trick or treaters come to the door. She has no treats to give so she gives them each a ride on her broom stick. It turns out to be the best Halloween ever. In her usual way she befriends the three normal children and amazes them with her magic spells.Mother Witch as usual is cooking some gross stuff and yelling about Little Witch's too nice behavior but in the end she loves her little witch in spite of these faults. It is charming and funny."
3,Dave Edmunds Rockin',"When I purchased this album I was disapointed.The best tracks on the album were done live, instead of the original studio recordings. It should be stipulated on the front cover that several songs are not the original version. Camden is a budget record label so this is probably to be expected."
4,Must have for the mage inclined!,"This book is a must have book, for those that want to do campaign s where you have mixed characters, or just want to give extra flavor to your stories. It about time White Wolf released a book to explain in cleaner detail, what really happened with the Tremere, what is all that brought them there, and how the Order of Hermes really feels about it. This is besides the point of making rules for the revenant, ghoul mages..."
2,"I Wanted A Source Book, Not A Play...","Blood Treachery has an engaging premise. A second, modern war between Mages and Kindred. However, other than a thin section of crunchy bits in the very back of the book, very little useful information is cleanly delievered. The majority of the text is taken up by gaming fiction written in the style of a Greek Tragedy.You're on your own for crafting the rules you wanted for Sphere vs. Discipline."
4,Informative Despite shortcomings,"As a Mage LARP Storyteller, I found this book to be very useful in helping me deal with the problem of vampires. (And in particular, a certain ghouled mage). The greek style drama about the Massasa War was both interesting and informative.Other than giving information about the Order of Hermes' reaction to Tremere and vampires and general, Blood Treachery also gives some information on the Celestial Umbrood amd gives information on ghouled mages.My only complaint really about this book is that it lacks Mind's Eye Theatre conversions. But the information packed into the book more than makes up for this."
3,serve the purpose,"These do what they are supposed to do but they look really goofy on, especially the blue. I would go ahead and spend a few more bucks to get the hard plastic ones. I ended up buying a new pair for my son after his first wrestling practice once I saw what all the other kids used. We were new to wrestling so I really didn't know what was what. However they were sturdy and comfortable for a 7 year old."
4,Good read.,I liked the Song of Acadia series but I was a bit disappointed in how it ended. Not sure what happened to the little boy :(
3,Good until the last chapter,"Last chapter overly repetitive, preachy. Good until the last chapter. A good Canadian view of the American Revolutionary War and religious beliefs at the time."
4,The Beloved Land Song Of Acadia#5,I loved the Song Of acadia Series. They were heart warming and very well written.The story was so informative and alive. I couln't put the books down once I started reading and had to buy the next book.
3,confused,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. It has been totally captivating, but one thing I can't understand. How can John Price's older half-sister (Louise Robichaud), be the same age as his daughter, Catherine?! Can someone halp me on this one? Other than that, it was a wonderful book. I can't help but feel somewhat let down that something like this slipped by the proof readers and editors."
5,Bogus Balloon,"We have a fireplace we rarely use and it was leaking cold air like an open window. I bought the balloon thinking it would plug the opening. It did at first, but the next morning I felt that crisp morning air chilling my hot cup of coffee as I sat in my recliner right by the fireplace again. I pulled the balloon from the fireplace flue and it had a hole on the seam so the cold-air-leaking-fireplace had a cold-air-leaking-fireplace-balloon leaking cold air into my home. Thumbs down on this one for me. It might have worked except for the leak on the seam."
2,disappointing,"This does not compare well with the older releases. There are only a couple of good tracks on this release (by soulshaker and bodyrockers), and the rest is generic filler material.Either there isn't much good new dance music being made anymore (which I find hard to believe) or Hed Kandi is not doing their job."
3,Read this if you have free time & are patient,"The 8th Habit is a good book for managers to read if they have a lot of spare time available to them.This book would be most beneficial if read over a long period of time as Covey suggests. The book can be preachy and overcrowded with repeated information, and it reads similar to a textbook. Overall, the personal stories and information provided do bring a new perspective to the working world and by and large were helpful to me."
4,Stephen Covey did it again!,"This is the perfect book to followThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Read this book, get your Voice heard."
1,Poorly written without passion or purpose,"Who wrote this book.... or what group of editors? IF there was something valuable in the book, it is lost because the reader can't get through to it. The only ""new"" concept here is ""spiritual intelligence"". It is the balancing force between IQ and EQ. I liked it... it made sense to me. So stop reading after chapter 5."
2,"Too cumbersome, not at his best","This book carries forth the concept from Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. While there are many good concepts contained within the book, I find it to be a bit cumbersome, overwhelming and a tad repetitive in getting the message across.The book is divided into two primary sections. The first is finding your voice. This section is significantly smaller then ""Inspiring Other's to Find Their Voice"". Nothing really new is contained within the book - principles, values, adding value, modeling the way - all of which is a repeat.The most significant aspect of the book is the section ""Twenty Most Commonly Asked Questions."" Real questions with, real time answers."
1,Big Letdown :-(,"I love the 7 habits, and eagerly snapped up the 8th Habit when I saw it in the store. It turned out to be *very* tedious reading, and I ended up returning it. Like others here, I'm amazed how the same author could produce works that very so greatly."
4,"Topical, but tedious","As with most of his previous writings, Dr. Covey has a great point to get across and does an excellent job of motivating it and presenting it in a way that makes it easy to apply to yourself. Unfortunately, unlike his other books, this one was a bit tedious to get through. The mixture of inspirational content (quotes and motivational passages), reiteration of concepts, mapping of his concepts onto the presentations of others in the leadership and self-help community, and just general pacing added up to make this far longer than I would've preferred. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who isn't a speed reader."
3,I agree with other readers,"I'd have to agree with many of the reviews here. Loved Seven Habits, read it many years ago. This one... is... just... a bit... slow... and goes on... and on. I glazed over and haven't read the last bit. I also tired of the repetition - the book is over long as it is, so why add in stories from other books? It seemed unnecessary. Anyway, I admire his intent."
3,"Sad, but true","I am a long time fan of S. Covey's work and a living example of using the 7-Habits as a platform to assist in managing my life. I have seen Covey speak on numerous occassions and have attended many a seminar.As a Covey fan, that's what makes this review tough. I am positive that there are jewels of wisdom contained in The 8th Habit, but I just can't get to them! The book is really tough to get through. Mixed messages that get off topic, visuals that aren't intuitive....just not very good.I had recently signed up to attend an 8th Habit Seminar in Denver. After attempting to reconnect with the book, and failing, for the 4th time, I call FranklinCovey today to ask for a refund for my seminar.If this wasn't a Covey book, I would have given it one star. The three star designation is more out of respect for Mr. Covey and his work vs. how I really felt about his latest effort.Sorry to leave such an awful review, but, that's the way I see it. Terribly disappointing."
2,Covey's 8th Habit - To Sell More Books,"Rehash of the 7 Habits which was a great book. Covey's application offers impractical solutions to today's complexities, and perhaps in a ""Rockwellian,"" cookie cutter society of yesteryear would be much more EFFECTIVE."
3,Bring a Paddle,"Ok I'll admit, I didn't read the first 7 Habits but when I found the 8th at the library, I figured I'd get right to the point. I can imagine copies of this book have logged many frequent flyer miles, with middle-upper management types studying earnestly while sitting in seat 29B, on their way to Corporate Headquarters.As I'm not in the a corporate/business world, I really lost interest in the book. There could be one or two brilliant points per chapter that could be applied to personal life, but I don't think I'm very keen on paddling through to find them. If you can get through the overhead projector/PowerPoint-style illustrations (very dry, very dull) then you might find parts of this book to be of use. I think Covey is banking on his name, rather than the content, to move copies."
2,Confusing and disorienting,"The original book, ""7 Habits"" was brilliant and a life changer. This book was nearly a distraction and I didn't enjoy it very much. rather spend your time rereading the original a couple times! Loved that book!"
3,DVD defective,"This is a heads up regarding the DVD. The DVD that was in my copy appears to be formated for region 2 (Asia, Japan). That makes it unplayable in the U.S.A. I know others are having the same problem."
2,for the systems analyst in all of us!,"This book does have a lot of good stuff, way too much good stuff, way way too many concepts and principles to coalesce into a main idea. I sometimes enjoy the self help genre because they are usually inspiring and fun. Not so here.Unfortunately, I think Covey has made this too systematic. It lacks the emotional content, inspiration factor. Give me a Tony Robbins CD over this any day!Covey's 7 Habits was a much more focused and enjoyable."
1,I am really dissapointed,"Well if this is the 8th habit I guess it has 1/7th substance of the book ""the 7 habits..."". One seventh is maybe a fair judgment - then I should be rating it 0,71 stars since I gave ""the 7 ..."" 5 stars. I finished it and was not totally bored, but I was far from impressed either. Save the money - you will not miss out on anything new."
1,Not evolved enough,"Covey takes way too long to get to the point of the 8th Habit, mostly repeating material covered in his earlier books. Practical examples were always his weak point, and while he tells a lot of stories, there are really no demonstrations of how this ""8th habit"" is applied in real life. The DVD has a couple nice bits, but mostly it's just distracting. Check this out from the library if you can, before you spend any money on it."
4,No DVD but very good,"The product is very good, I was disappointed that i did not receive the DVD with the Companion films. This book is a must read for everyone who is in, or is considering being in a Leadershp position."
4,"Could also be called ""Buddhism for Business""","My personal belief is the entire 7 Habits/FranklinCovey collection can best be described as ""Buddhism for Business"". The values-based leadership models get to the core of some of the most basic tenets of Buddhism's focus on helping yourself through compassion and understanding others from their point of view. What ""The 8th Habit"" does is it adds depth to the 7 Habits material. Whereas the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People brings a person from dependency to interdependency, the 8th Habit brings it further from interdependency to leadership. It very nicely ties it all together. I would highly recommend this book, but only to someone that has either read or taken a workshop to internalize the 7 Habits material first. This book is worth reading but only as a sequel to the original."
3,Fair to middling,"Get down to brass tacks...Gee whiz! the message conveyed in this book could have been fit in few pages. It is almost a thesis and certainly cannot be used to teach( as Steven refers to, in all his books)! Steven's previous best seller, 'The 7 habits of most effective people' still stands tall and this book seems to be a mere repetition of those ideas...almost seemed to me like a fifth wheel!All in all, an OK book..some good quotes and an interesting question/answer section at the end of each chapter got me going.DVD is worthless and does not effectively communicate the gist of the book."
2,Should have stuck with Seven,"Seven Habits - gave me some terrific idea's however the 8th habit was as fun and interesting to read as the manual to set up my Tivo. Seems line Covey didn't spend enough time sharpening his saw, this book feels like an attempt to cash in and out."
1,A better book is A Brush with Darkness,"If you need to find your inner voice, learn to communicate with others better, to motivate and lead, to discover your own personal path and change the inner person that you are in order to be more effective as a manager or a person I recommend a book that is NOT written as a self help book. A Brush with Darkness is the most fascinating, enlightening book that has come along in ages. A friend gave me both books and said I would find the Covey book more to my liking, but in fact I was inspired, rejuvenated and astounded when I read A Brush with Darkness. Looking for more effective behavior in your life? then dont buy the Covey book but look beyond the self help shelf to this one."
1,Flagellants wanted.,"Another revelation from the Great Karnak of motivational manure. ""Without passion"" Covey write (and I paraphrase) ""people achieve nothing"". With passion production increases. Passion is motivated through pain. By inflicting pain through the company we don't have to wait until the market inflicts pain. The Seven Habits book was enough hyper-analyzing for most of us, but this Eighth Habit is too much. Just wait long enough...used copies will become available."
5,An explosive book,This book is well written. Do not wait to finish reading this review. Go out and buy this book.Ishmael
1,"Disappointing, tedious and MUCH too long","I just read several of the other reviews of this book on the Amazon site and they were obviously written, in my opinion, by people who either haven't read the book or have some interest in selling the book. I have loved Covey's other books and I think his software and paper products are terrific, but this book is the ultimate in taking something simple and making it complex (and very tedious to read). Way too long. Tedious reading. I have a feeling many of the other reviews originated from areas near Provo, Utah."
2,"Long-winded, scattered, unoriginal, lack of application","Given the high-expectations most people have for Covey, this book disappoints.Long-winded: Covey takes way too long to explain what he is trying to say. I found myself saying 'OK!, lets get to the point already'. This book should be a quater of its size.Scattered: The material and thoughts in the book are scattered.Unoriginal: Alot of material from other authors were used. Alot of time spent reviewing his ideas from the 7 Habits. Alot of pages wasted mapping his ideas to other authors.Lack of application: No substantial application for readers to apply.Overall disappointing. Book has good intentions but message delivered poorly and uneffectively."
4,Reactions- Jeff Kucharski,"The 8th Habit will take you from effectiveness to greatness. Stephen R. Covey creates the road map that will expand your mind to a higher level of thinking. Leaders will be challenged to ""find their voice and inspire others to find theirs."" Covey uses a mix of personal experiences, inspirational quotes, and short stories to get his points across. Sixteen inspirational companion films are included in a DVD for viewing at your leisure."
1,Poorly Researched and Redundant,"Having admired Dr. Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and First Things First (the latter written with the Merrills), I admit to be highly disappointed with the current volume. It's a shoddy piece of work; a real cut-and-paste job.Here's just one example: There is a lengthy quotation given, which readers of self-help books will recognize as ""The Paradoxical Commandments"" by Dr. Kent Keith. I can not quote them here for copyright reasons. The point is that Covey has erroneously attributed them to Mother Theresa, who no more wrote them than I did. And that's only one example.Stay away from this book, and if you've already bought it, see if you can return it. If not, hurl it in the garbage."
4,Does not look like what I ordered.,"The name of the product is ""full length hooded panne veleet cap with spider trim"". And that fits the description of what I got, but what I received and what's in that picture are completely different.Also, short girls like myself, this is indeed FULL LENGTH. The hood fits way too big, so big that the point doesn't stick out at all, and it drags on the ground (i'm 5'2, so that was expected).In the picture, the cape is grayish and almost sheer looking, and the cape i received is velvety and black, a little shimmery. And the spiders on the front are very childish looking. I would return it but I know I wont get another cape in time for halloween unless I spend a fortune on shipping.I still give this product a four out of five stars because its a good cape. Just not what's depicted."
5,This little book is one great emotional rollercoaster.,"If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know I'm a devoted fan of Ms. Fetzer's work. It started with Timeswept Heart and then whatever I could get my hands on. This book makes you laugh, cry, and love the characters. Chase is one in a million guy who you'd want to father your child. He wants to have kids. He gives a sample of his semen thinking to help out his ex-wfe, when he finds out she played a trick on him. Tess wants a baby also and gets artificial insemination. That's all you need to know to want to read more of this book. This book is short and fast, so enjoy every second of it. It's a beautiful story of love. Fetzer gives Johanna Lindsey, Julie Garwood, Virginia Henley, Amada Quick, and Kathleen Woodiwiss competition for writing great romances."
1,"Factually Incorrect, Out of Date","I am an experienced Red Hat Linux user and was disgusted at how much incorrect and/or misleading information is in this book and the others in this series. The book is years out of date on config tools, printer tools, etc. They explain linuxconf. :| They talk about LILO but not GRUB. :| I know one of the technical editors for this book, who said that she was paid to proof the books, but the publisher decided to pay no attention to her comments. I am saddened that this book has the Red Hat name, and suggest you avoid this title."
4,I use it every day,I found this book to be a very useful reference for me on the job. If you are new to Linux this book is perfect for getting you started and familiar with the Linux system. The writing style is straight to the point which makes it very easy to look up information on the fly. I use it every day.
2,"Great for installation, but tails off rapidly after that","This is only a really great book if you want to set up your computer exactly the same way the author did. As a newbie (with some Unix experience), I was dissapointed to find the info is not very in depth after the installation & setup chapters. The installation process walk-through is not only dated, but at several points the author says there are other options, but I'll just assume you're going to do this my way.It was fairly helpful while I was installing the OS, but I don't think I've touched it since."
5,Perfect companion to David Page Coffin's Shirtmaking,"Currently my favorite sewing book. Make that my favorite book. It's very useful for sewing shirts as well as blouses. The most useful chapter is no.4, The Best Sewing Techniques. As opposed to Mr. Coffin's illustrations, (another excellent book) this one has very clear color photographs of each technique and it's various steps. Her techniques appear to come from the within the industry and should be part of any serious sewer's arsenal. The instructions are some of the clearest I've come across. Don't sew another yoked shirt/blouse until you've looked at the technique shown here. Ms. Long's work, shown as examples, is absolutely flawless. The beauty is in the crisp execution of details such as welt pockets and plackets. This book inspires me to improve and perfect my sewing skills towards that of Connie Long's."
5,Answers questions I didn't know to ask,"This book answers the questions I didn't know to ask. I bought it for sewing techniques for professional looking garments ... section 4 of the book. The first part of the book covers fabric, tools, measuring and pattern fitting. I've sewn for years and already have a book on pattern drafting and adjustment so I didn't plan to read that section. As it turns out, I am also using the first sections. This book simplifies everything in short, concise, easy to understand words. The illustrations are exactly right. I'm really impressed!"
3,Tons on folklore...,"Anthony Masters really did a good job of digging up all the legends and myths of vampires from around the world. Half the book deals with vampire traits and practices, with follow up chapters on Pagan Vampires and vampires in Christianity. Where the book fails to really dig in and give us the deatils we want is when he starts to write about vampires in fiction. The chapters on vampires in literature and in the field of entertainment are slim. Even the chapter on vampires today seems to be nothing but an afterthought. The bibliography is useful for those interested in going to the raw sources.Overall, if it had just been on folklore vampires, I would have given it five stars. But the title promises more and, frankly, did not deliver."
3,it is ok,"Masters gives us a detail description of vampire's believes in different countries, what makes me doubt about how much of this is fact, it is the big mistake he does when he talks about the vampires in Peru, the name of the god in his book is not an Andean name (quechua, aymara, etc.) it is a Mayan or Aztec name. If he makes that mistake how many others the book might have."
5,SOPHIE CONRAN BY PORTMEIRION SOUP BOWLS,"THESE BOWLS ARE A GREAT ADD ON TO ME SET OF SOPHIE CONRAN. VERY VERSITILE FOR SOUPS, PASTA AND LOOK GREAT AT THE PLACE SETTING WITH DINNER PLATE UNDERNEATH. WILL ORDER MORE."
3,BBA is the Low Point of Beck's Career,"I've had this for years and didn't pay anywhere near this price.Considering Beck has played some of the most incredible guitar in the history of rock, his playing here sounds uninspired. Carmine Appice's vocals are nothing short of annoying. Take this money and buy as much of Beck's catalog, including his Yardbirds work, as possible. This one is for completists and collectors."
4,Period piece for school play,This was purchased as part of a costume for a school project. I doubt if it has been worn since because it is not the style of a 12 yr old boy. But I found it to be well made and would be worth the money for someone who does wear this style. It suited our needs because it fit the bill and I didn't have to go from store to store to find what we needed.
1,Really didn't like this one,The quality of this hat is poor. a huge rubber inner band which was uncomfortable. The hat felt crumbly the wrinkled texture felt of poor quality. Would not recommend this hat.
4,First Love - My Opinion,"I listened to all of these artists as a young christian, and through the years. They are great examples and leaders in the Jesus Music period.The only person who I think they should include on this recording would be Phil Keaggy. Not sure if they asked & he refused, but he certainly was as influential as these folks.Not to lessen the impact of these artists, but Phil is still recording great music."
4,The Perfect Gift,"I bought this dvd set for my dad for Father's Day. He loved it, and was pretty emotional through some of the testimonies. It is a great gift for anyone who has an interest in Jesus music.Each person shares his/her personal testimony, and then presents a couple of songs. Most of them sang old familiar hits. They also did a presentation about Keith Green, which included some old home videos and a soundtrack of a song I wasn't familiar with.I missed a few stars, including Michael Omartian and Phil Keaggy (although both answered a few questions in separate interviews). I would have enjoyed seeing them perform some of their early hits as well. All in all, I highly recommend this set!"
4,Heart warming,"Very good to see and hear these pioneer christian artists, that they still love Jesus and are so passionate. With short interviews and various filmshots of the Jesus movement in between. It is moving and touches the heart. All the played music is also delivered on two cd's, so you can fully enjoy the music. A nice product for a nice price!"
4,Wise selection,"This fan/heater/light combo functions very well. Fan is very quiet. Heater is a little louder, but not bad. Very sturdy construction, heavy (which to me means quality build). I like the way the total mounting system secures it tightly against the ceiling. Had to modify where the brackets mount on the unit to make it fit well where I removed the old fan/light unit. Also had to pull a couple of wires. Make sure you get the right bulbs, regular shape bulbs won't work. Have had it installed for a month or so now and very happy with it. Seems like a high quality unit."
3,imagery explained,"The imagery of the bible has always fascinated me...it's all so similar, it seems to all be pointing at the same thing. But what is that? This explores that imagery & more, and was very entertaining & informative. It brought up possibilities that I had never heard before. It's so nice when you get fresh takes on a subject you know a lot about!"
5,Complicated and interesting,"Already having been a Gardiner fan even though my faith differs, I was excited to watch this DVD and he did not disappoint. He facts were clear and interesting. His passion for the subject made for an interesting documentary type film with great sights as well as information. Great to watch!"
1,A joke,"Tell me they're joking, the earlier reviewers. This DVD is a dreadful piece of work.Gardiner's arguments are all over the place, and time after time he makes assertions without any evidence at all, then treats them as fact.As for the production, it's so OTT it's laughable, with the ridiculous over-use of jangling artwork and the music frequently drowning out the speech (though maybe that's not such a bad thing!).Bad, bad, bad. Save your money. Avoid."
5,Excellent book by superb author,"I agree with P Shipman. The reed review completely misses the point. Narrative necessity and the entire flavor of the story requires the ""key event"" be out the main narrative flow.Additional enjoyment for those who like Masterpiece Theatre type programs will be pleased that one of the plot strands has the characters' filming one. Additional humor."
1,tekno,"Was a complete disappointment, but due to condition of the merchandise upon receipt.After opening the package, the toy appeared worn, dirty and scratched. The box was obviously opened and retaped by someone else (perhaps someone returning the item, attempting to make it look like a new box).The toy did not work, so I cannot fairly review its performance. Even after we replaced all of the expensive batteries, it did not work well.We returned the item and are still waiting for a credit."
4,"Neat toy, packaging tough.","Kids liked it, appropriate for younger kids over age of 4 btw. Packaging was really, really tough to get open (bring a screwdriver) but quality of toy was ok, funny to watch."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this to gift to my nephew. He was amazed looking at it.Here are some pros:- Very sturdy and robust.- Good battery life.- Voice activated and make you feel like real puppy.Here are some cons:- Can walk only in straight line, cannot change the direction when obstructed.- Bark could have been more realistic.- You can teach tricks to the puppy, but only canned tricks by complex combination of pressing multiple buttons.Bottom line, it makes kids happy."
3,Great Toy for Kids (Not above 6 or 7),"We bought one for our oldest daughter last year; however, she seemed a little too old for the limitations of the dog. Obviously, since it does a lot of barking and not a whole lot else, it was a ""great toy"" for a week. We bought one this year for our youngest daughter who has been wanting one since last year. She is 5, which appears to be a better age range for this dog."
4,My son loves it.,"My son, who is a toddler, loves this thing. We were concerned at first that he might be frightened by it,but he seems to be very curious about what it is and how it works. The lights and sound effects are alot of fun as well. Once we turn it on he follows it around like it was a real dog. I recommend it."
2,Very disappointing,"We purchased this for our four year old son after reading favorable reviews on another shopping site.What a disappointment. Tekno doesn't do half the things promised on the packaging. We've replaced the batteries, followed the instructions to a T, and tried their customer service line (which always seems to be a recording saying ""All representatives are busy, please try again later."" no matter when you call).So... customer service is non-existent AND you can't return him to the store. It says right in the instruction booklet, ""This product cannot be returned for a refund after it has been unpacked and used."" How do you know it doesn't work until you unpack and try it????In short, save your money. This one is a real loser."
1,Tekno - a major disappointment,"It took us about 15 minutes to liberate Tekno from his Chinese prison (you need some tools for this). You basically have to destroy the carry case/package - this is a very poor design. Then it took us quite a while to get Tekno to ""respond"" and even more time to get him to work properly. We hung in there, and after a lot more time and frustration, we finally figured out how to get him to do his tricks. Unfortunately, by the time we had accomplished this my 7 year old had lost interest. The ""tricks"" are quite rudimentary and not very interesting. My son has not touched the toy once since Christmas. This toy was a big disappointment and a complete waste of money."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this product as a gift for Christmas. Truly disappointing! First, it was a major hurdle just getting this thing out of the box. The whole process took about 40 minutes or so. But then, the pre-installed batteries did not work in either the dog or the remote. So, off to a local pharmacy to buy batteries. After the new batteries were installed, the product turned on but did not work as was claimed. The remote does not work at all and it seems that the dog just walks back and forth. If you expect anything more from this toy, it's a bad investment."
5,Magical book for young readers with strong heroine,"I probably read this book once a month during seventh and eighth grade. I was entranced by the first strong, compassionate woman heroine I had discovered, and the lovely descriptions of romance and intrigue in an exotic setting. I read this book nearly forty years ago and can still quote some of the lines!"
4,Still a good read,"This book was given to me as a Sunday School prize when I was 10 or 11 years old. I loved it. I recently found another copy which I plan to give my granddaughter. I re-read it and found it is still a good read and I will check out other books by Gladys Malvern. ""Behold Your Queen!"" may be more myth than reality, and in some aspects is today not quite ""politically correct."" It is nonetheless a gripping story. I even read the Book of Esther and could see where the author incorporated descriptions of the royal palace into her narrative. I recommend this book which stands the test of years because it is well written and is the type of book which would send a reader off on other quests for knowledge."
3,Wonderful Colorful Illustrations..but...,"This 2 volume set has some beautiful colored photos of many rare and unusual conifers. However, one must constantly check the back pages for the many 'corrections' in the photo captions. Very annoying because there are many! As a pictoral reference this 2 volume set would be fine, but for any serious gardener or professional that wants more than just a pretty picture I would not recomend this set. Nothing is included on individual zone hardiness, mature heights,culture,disease and insect problems,or suggested landscape uses. All of which one would expect from a book of this caliper."
4,Fodor's Rome,"Good price, shipped fast, good condition. Only problem was tear out map of Rome was missing. Very pleased overall."
2,"Um, it fell apart... twice","I purchased one of these, about a month or two later the spring blew and I had to get another one... that one broke too *sigh* I didn't bother getting a hold of anyone (I'm sure they would have been more than willing to help)I was just too busy to bother"
5,Tennis Shoes,"I adored this book as a child. I can't believe it's out of print in the uk. It tells the story of four children training to become professional tennis players. Nicky, the heroine is an interesting character and it gives a real picture of her struggle, as well as the points where she loses motivation. There is also an interesting point where her older sister discovers she is not good enough and has to give up. This is a great read and also has depth."
4,When two french girls meet and enjoy eros,"The tres belles Parisiennes, Liz and Beth, meet in this premiere volume, and take an instant liking to one another. They prove it in bedrooms, forests, and swimming pools without vulgarity but hot sensuality. There's a touch of bondage and spanking in here as well. Very beautiful album with fine graphics. Definitely a must have for those who like erotic comics."
2,Words that don't go together (with apologies to George Carlin):,"Jumbo shrimp, Random order, Pretty ugly, Army intelligence, Baby Grand, Act naturally...And now:Erotic comics."
4,Nice but,"These shams are nice, but I purchased some very inexpensive ones that I like just as well.I do like the two-tones and versatility of the simple design."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"I bought this book at the same time I bought ""Raving Fans"" by the same authors. Though the book does contain a message I have to say that I was a little disappointed by the author's method of conveying the same. I feel like they kind of take you around the world just to get you down the street. I would NOT recommend this book."
5,Inspiring,I actually downloaded the audio book of this for my wife. She needed a copy of it for work and wanted to listen to it in the car on her commute. I started listening to it one day out of curiosity and found myself hooked by the story. I have listened to this book around a dozen times now and love the story and message it brings. I highly recommend this book to anyone and not just those people looking to form better work habits and environments.
1,Insultingly contrived and fabricated,The entire story is obviously fiction and built around several basic business principles that get stretched over 150+ pages. The print covers only half the page so they can stretch it out to book length. Insulting.
5,Simply the Best,"This philosophy is applicable in your professional or, personal life. Based on a true story, what Peggy and Andy accomplish together is nothing short of amazing! I want to work in this environment! Heck, I want to live in this environment!"
4,Great read,Uplifting ideas for team building. Ken Blanchard is a genius when it comes to writing about business...Raving Fan and Gung Ho are a terrific partnership. Get them both
5,Awesome Book,"This is an easy to read book. A must for anyone in any organization. I was able to read the entire book in just two evenings -- however, it is one that I will continue to refere to again and again. I have shared it with my boss and co-workers."
4,You may be able to take something from it,"Managers may not be able to enact all of the principles of Gung Ho, but they will be able to walk away with some valuable insight in the world of motivation and performance. If your not sure if you really want this book or not I would recommend that you go for it. There is truly nothing to lose and the reading is entertaining and informative. Every person will be able able to take something from this book and be able to apply it to their work environment."
1,Laughable/Insulting,"We were subjected to the full Gung-Ho experience about 6 years ago. If you want a management video that generates uncontrollable laughter, this is the one. The native american character passing on timeless secrets of business management is SO believable--cuz if there's one thing Native American's care about, it's effective industrial management! Gotta make the big bucks for those CEO's! After all, ""Gung-Ho!"" is an old Haida word that means--no, wait, it's a word GI's brought back from East Asia. Blanchard can't even keep his shallow stereotrypes straight. Pure rubbish."
2,Am I missing something?,"I purchased the audio version of the book. First, the reader, Agnes Herrmann, was terrible. Her reading was at times comicle when it wasn't supposed to be.The content of the book was below average in my opinion. Again maybe it was just the way it was being read but I could not take it seriously and the content came across as being ""Made Up"" or ""Fake""...just did not seem genuine to me.I bought Gung Ho becasue of the overwhelming positive reviews about it. I was very dissapointed."
3,gung ho!,"If you are in need of learning how to make people work more productively than then this is probably a good book for you. It has interesting ideas, and isn't too boring. It tells the story well, and is probably very helpful for people who need this information. All in all it is a good book. It's not necessarily the classic afternoon read, but even if you're not in charge of productivity for an entire factory, this book can give lessons that can be applied to life."
5,"Excellent, straightforward book","I enjoyed the positive, straightforward, simplified approach to making a difference in the workplace. Today's economy has created an atmosphere of fear and negativity that has spread throughout most businesses from the ground up. A book like this - put to use - could make a real difference."
5,Inspirational Lesson,"Gung Ho! Shows many different aspects in the busines. How you can be at the bottom, and change your attitude and head straight up to the top to reach success. This book will change your feelings about work itself. Its a great book."
5,Mandatory reading for all supervisors and managers.,"Blanchard, et. al. have done it again: delivered an important lesson in an easy to digest style. This book is as entertaining as it is instructive. It is notable that a book that can be read in a lunch hour can be filled with a careers worth of instruction and inspiration. I am an unabashed Blanchard fan and this book helps me justify my enthusiasm for his work. Read it and thank me when you are done."
5,"Every CEO, employee, and manager should read this book.",Everyone reading this book has to agree that it hits home in every aspect of business practices. Why companies and people don't apply these principles or even think about them until it's to late and the business is failing is beyond belief.
3,"A little hokey, but good advice, although nothing new","As always, a Ken Blanchard book takes less than an hour to read. Gung Ho! offers up basic management principles in a unique format, but its sentimentality wears thin."
5,Why did we need someone to tell us?,"After reading this book, all I can say is that there must be quite a few embarassed managers out there. The Gung Ho concept is so simple, it seems that educated people shouldn't have needed someone to put it in writing for them. The 3 basic principles described in the book are things always talked about in management meetings, but they just aren't put into practice enough.This book is a must read for anyone (management or not) who would one day like to work in the best organization in the country. Unbelievably Motivational!!!!"
1,"If you are a manager using this book, your employees hate you and ridicule you behind your back","Are you kidding me? First, this book was written at the 4th grade level, and badly at that. Second, comparing your employees to rodents is insulting. Third, Beaver?!? Beaver?!? Is the author completely unfamiliar with the decidedly unprofessional connotation with this large furry mammal? If you bought read this book, or made your employees read this book and think that you learned anything in it that will assist you with managing today's employees, you are so horribly out of touch with the modern workplace that you will definitely not be able to get a job in 5 years. Everyone under 40 will think you are an idiot."
5,outstanding!,i love heroines with true strength! this is one of my all time delinsky fav's... lets get heart of the night on kindle...
1,why do authors re-package their old novels and sell as new?,"I was quite upset after receiving this book to find I have had read it years before. This should be stated in the ad about the book. Although , I love Mrs. Delinsky's books, I have found her and her publishers to make this a habit! Plus I was charged to return it......"
5,Great Read,I loved this book! The twists and turns keep you entrigued. There were plenty of times by jaw dropped. I was disappointed to finish reading. It is definitely a book that keeps you guessing.
2,Ever so tiny..........,"Its a very nice book, quality wise....except for the fact that it is tiny. I have only myself to blame for not checking the dimensions but i was in a rush and what not. However, please take to heart that this is not your 'traditional' coloring book. Im hitting up the bookstores for a replacement....."
3,"Worth it for ""Clock""","A so-so collection featuring the amazing ""Where It's At,"" two so-so remixes of that track and two atrocious remixes of ""Devil's Haircut."" (Remixes, in general, are a waste in my opinion). However, if you're a Beck fanatic like myself, it's worth getting for ""Clock"", a magnificently funky, hip-hop track that stands with anything on ""Odelay."""
4,cool ep,"Where It's At! This is probably the coolest of the many cool Odelay import eps out there. Clock is an excellent, highly catchy song... and the remixes of Where It's At are worthwhile, too. The Devil's Haircut remixes are all available a number of different places..As is always the case with these deals, though... it's way expensive."
5,Great for a 4 year old,"My daugther just received this CD-ROM game for her birthday. She just turned 4 and she has really enjoyed the game. I like that she can manouver around the screen without my help (I do have a savvy 7 year old who likes to help)It isn't an educational game, but she does enjoy beautifying everything. And it has enough to occupy her for more than a few minutes.We also enjoy the Barbie Princess and the Pauper game, which, perhaps I think is even a better one."
3,"Cool looks, good features, but poor sound quality","Looks good, has a lot of features, but I found the sound quality to be lacking in two areas: 1) the greeting that I recorded sounded very muffled when I called my answering machine to check it, and 2) the handset earpiece didn't have very clear sound."
3,Caller recordings muffled,"The Achilles heel of this otherwise excellent phone is that the incoming caller recordings are muffled. Unfortunately, this occasionally means not being able to understand the phone number a caller is trying to leave."
1,Lasted all of one week,"Worked fine out of the box, but one week later phone would ""freeze"" (just like a computer freezes) periodically, and buttons would operate random functions. Pushing a 9 would get you the phone directory, for example. Obviopusly the circuit board has gone haywire--and the product back to the dealer."
2,Just OK,"purchased a phone from them. although they marked it as used, this thing should have been marked done. The keys are mostly rubbed off. the battery for the cordless part was dead...but it arrived on time."
1,Do not buy this product,This telephone did not work at all first the caller ID failed and later the phone did not hangup stay on all the time. Please do not buy this brand give a lot of traubles and have a no good custemer service
2,Cheaper price.....Cheaper phone,"This phone works ok, but it is not a quality phone.........but it was fairly priced. Sound quality is not so good. Next time I'll opt for a better quality at a higher price.My service from the seller was excellent...I just made the wrong choice in phones."
3,Western Noir?,"Claimed to be a Western noir movie, Pursued has a convoluted (Althusser would call it overdetermined) story, and too many killings to make it plausible. Like other Olive Film releases, this Blue Ray version has no subtitles (what's the excuse?). After my third viewing in VHS and now in Blue Ray, I find Pursued overrated because it lacks plausibility. The characters are simplistic; they are not well developed, and the timeline is too long for a film that is not a saga. If you have a DVD version, there is no reason to acquire this Blue Ray edition. Olive Film has to do more to make its (company) Blue Ray releases more rewarding."
2,Not so great,The graphics are pretty dull and it wasn't as exciting as I would have hoped. There just wasn't as much to do as they claim.
5,"like wine: the older, the better!!!","outstanding performance!!! those 4 people really know how to perform and get audience 100% attention! Mix of really famous songs and some not so much , but a perfect balance."
1,Extremely annoying band,"This concert tour is hard to watch let alone own, and it's not because they are getting old, it's because they were never good to begin with. It's a wonder how some of their songs like Love Shack ever became hits. Maybe because they were played so much and it's hard to get out of your head, but it's not quality or even fun music. For fun 80s pop with replay value go with something by Madonna, Michael Jackson, or even Toto. This one is for fans only."
3,For Beirach Fans,"On this CD Beirach presents a seven piece suite (six pieces are his own, one is by Lee Ann Ledgerwood) on the theme of Antarctica. His solo piano here is appropriately cool, detached, mysterious, and abstract. However, there is an overall sameness to the music and, despite the icy subject, a little too much tinkling. Beirach fans, like myself, will want this in their collections. Others, who want a taste of this fine pianist, might be better served by his solo piano on ""Common Heart"" or his trio work on ""The Snow Leopard."""
1,Some good scenery but lacking a lot.,"This DVD is probably one of a kind about the Santa Fe -- especially the footage about the last run on the Santa Fe Branch. But it lacks a lot in video coverage of some of the most beautiful parts of the Santa Fe - such as the area around Raton Pass. The video coverage wastes a lot of time on street train coverage and doesn't cover some of the areas that are more interesting -- for example, Kansas City.Twila"
5,"Great introduction to the science of ""How we got here.""","This truly enjoyable book is a very readable overview of what I find to be some of the most interesting areas of science. The author clearly explains the formation of the universe, the formation of our solar system, and the mass extinction that eventually brought mammals to where they are today.I have recommended this book to many of my friends who have shown an interest in layman's astrophysics."
5,"End of the Spear a great cinematic production, but misses the point.","The point of the lives and deaths of the missionaries and their lives was to share Christ with natives who needed to hear of salvation through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. The movie only made reference to their devotion to the Gospel and therefore the spear missed the mark. At any rate, I recommend this movie very highly as it was writeen, produced and acted exceeding the standards of today's dismal cinematic standards."
5,Great movie,I loved this movie! Based on a true story. Awesome story of love and forgiveness. Scenery was breathtaking and actors were excellent.
2,End of the Spear,"I expected more of the tribe and the way they are living-not a story of Steve Saints search for the truth about his fathers death, Since I have been to the Aucas(waorani)village in the jungles plus spending time on the Protectorate, I found a lot of history was left out of the film-I have pictures of Palm beach, and of the plaque placed (now) in the protectorate. I spent time with Rachel Saint and Dayuma - left out of the film was how Dayuma's son played a part in the tribe's development in contact with western civilazation. Also, how Dayuma became Materiarch of the tribe and worked hard to get the protectorate formed, The last scene showing Minkaya down on his knees was terrible, Minkaya is to bashful to ever have preform in that way.Since I am so familuar with these people, I guess the film was not what I expected."
2,The Spear Missed Its Mark,"I was disappointed by the End of the Spear for one major reason: they avoided the whole reason that Nate Saint and his team went to the tribe. The main reason was not to stop the killing althought they wanted to stop the killing. It was not to change their culture although it needed to be changed before they killed themselves off. It was not to bring better living conditions, health, and clothing although these needed changing. The reason the missionaries risked their lives to go to this tribe was because they sincerely believed that since these people had never heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ, they would never have a chance to believe and have eternal life with God. Their earnestness came from this conviction. Aside one or two vague references to this, the movie missed the point. This is not merely an opinion. Read the primary sources yourself. These include: Through Gates of Spleandor by Elisabeth Elliot, Jungle Pilot by Russel Hitt, and The Dayuma Story by Ethel Wallis"
5,"If your interested in Missions this movie is a ""MUST SEE"".","This movie was very well directed and produced. The acting was supurb. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in missions and/or even if you are not,it is a ""MUST SEE"". This true story will touch your heart, and leave you in awe. I have watched the movie, and read the book (which I could not put down until I finished reading it) and I am planning to watch the movie again soon, with my family."
5,Wonderful film about forgiveness and faith.,"I know a lot of the details of this story and have heard many interviews of Steve Saint. The movie is very well done and entertaining It is an extraordinary story of missionaries who sacrifice their own comfort and safety to reach a people lost to violence and self destruction. I still find it so amazing that a group of American widows would go to live (with their children mind you) and care for the South American tribe who murdered their husbands. Only having a personal knowledge of God and his grace could explain their action of forgiveness. I recommend getting 'through the gates of splendor' as well, the documentary with the real people involved. Definitely recommend 'End of the Spear' to own and share with others."
2,"Real ""white man's burden"" stuff","I ordered this from the library only to discover that it is an unfortunate piece of christian propaganda. The movie doesn't reveal very much about the culture of the Waodani (aside, that is, from the racist suggestion that they are nothing but ignorant savages). It does, however, subtly and unintentionally reveal a great deal about the genuine ignorance and ethnocentrism of north american culture. The epilogue, where Mincayani is introduced to such facets of american high culture as the fast food drive thru and the grocery superstore, is particularly telling."
5,best Christian movie,"A movie after the Lord's own heart. By far, the best Christian movie I've ever seen, and I'm getting up there in years. A wonderful gift to give."
5,Please watch,The true story told so well. These men gave up their lives for something few understand but all need to.
5,End of The Spear DVD,"Superb true-to-life story of life among the ""Aucas"" (Waodani) of Ecuador, especially honoring the five young men who were speared by the Aucas. A grand, compelling story told by the adult son of one of the martyrs, who himself grew up in Ecuador and returned to visit the village. Outstanding!"
2,"Important story, not well told","This true story is an important one of Christian forgiveness at its most difficult, but it is not well told. Scenes of tribal warfare and bloodshed dominate the early part of the film and they are confusing and disjointed, with subtitles which don't do much to enlighten the viewer. I agree with the reviewer who said that the missionaries who give their lives in Ecuador are shown as rather silly, instead of the dedicated Christians that they were. The photography is quite beautiful at times, but that is sometimes lost in the disjointed editing of the film. The supreme sacrifice which the 5 missionaries made deserves a better-made film than this."
2,disappointed,"the DVD arrived on time, no problems there but unfortunately it was scratched. It froze and skipped repeatedly through out the movie and we had to bypass whole scenes just to keep the movie moving forward. Disappointed, will never buy a used DVD again."
2,Pointed repetition,"Appreciating that this film is based on a true story and has outstanding cinematography, I stopped taking the plot seriously somewhere in the middle due to the depicted Waodani tribesmens' obsession over both the noun and verb form of the word ""spear."" After the intense opening scene, the rest of the spearfest got a little old -- almost to the point of satire, where viewers can use a stopwatch to time how many minutes pass in the film before something or someone gets impaled."
3,correction to previous reviews,"I'd like to set the record straight. The indigenous language spoken in the film is not the Waodani language. The actors are from the Northern Embera people group of Colombia and Panama and they are speaking their native language, Northern Embera. The Waodanis are portrayed by the Embera actors, all filmed in Panama. A few of the actual Waodanis do appear in the scene of Rachel's funeral, but all the others are Embera actors."
1,This worse thing I ever bought from you,This is just disk with almost empty excel files that all. This CD does not have any value.
2,Good idea gone bad......,"What started as an interesting idea for a Book turned into this rediculous nonsense....honestly, i couldn't even read the whole thing. If this is the first book somebody reads about marilyn that never read anything about her before, that person will get an inaccurate, distorded view of marilyn and somebody else's imagination.Stick to the real Biographies if you want the real story and this type of thing if you want pure fiction."
1,DESERVES ZERO STARS...BUT THAT ISN'T AN OPTION!,"Thank god I received this book as a gift!!! I would never spend my hard earned cash on something so awful. I tried to read Oates once before and am not even a fan of her style of writing. It is just not user friendly. There is too much weirdness going on. I am, however, I very big admirer and fan of Marilyn. It still amazes me that someone actually spent money and bought this book. I couldn't even finish it, I made it about 1/4 way through. Hoping that it would get better, but that didn't happen. I have nothing good to say about this book, it was boring. It is also very poorly written. I saw the picture of Oates on the back(she got hit with the ugly stick), and I think she was just jealous of Monroe's beauty. this was her revenge."
1,nothing to say,joyce carol oates never has anything to say --she dreams up these shallow things and then writes ABOUT THEM like theres no tomorrow --- great writers GOOD WRITERS write abOut things they have lived or imAGINED AND WE GET THIS VICARIOUS THRILL-I.E.LIKE BOOKS BY HENRY MILLER JOYCE VONNEGUT HESSE HAMSUN D H LAWRENCE BUKOWSKI GREAT BOOKS LIKE IN COLD BLOOD --- MS OATES SEEMS TO WRITE CAUSE SHE IS WHAT AFRAID OF LIFE -- LOVES TO HEAR THE SOUND OF HER OWN DUMB VOICE --SHE NEVER STOPS WRITING-- THIS ISNT TALENT ITS JUST THE OBSESSION OF A PEDANT WHO WONT SHUT UP __ IGNORE HER~~ MAYBE SHE AND HER PROMOTORS WILL GO AWAY ~ THO I DOUBT IT--HOW MANY BOOKS HAS SHE WRITTEN ANYWAY HUNDREDS RIGHT ? WAY TOO MANY I TELL YOU -- STOP THIS WOMAN ---ITS EMBARASSING ALREADY ~~
1,"Oh, no, not ANOTHER Marilyn book","When a writer has to resort to writing about someone who has been dead for so long, that is a sign the writer's talents and ideas have just about run out.Please stop this silly notion that Americans are obsessed with Marilyn Monroe, the Kennedys and Elizabeth Taylor.Who cares about any of them?"
1,Complete Fabrication,I saw the movie and it was horrible. Marilyn Monroe was a real person who does not settle for abuse. The author is a woman who has no respect and is incorporating her own sex life in the book. As a English Literature major I can tell she is suffering from a lack of sex. But I know that there are good writers out there who write Marilyn out of love and respect and do their homework.
3,too much,"I found Blonde sad, depressing and fascinating, But I couldn't finish it. I stopped reading about halfway through. I have stopped reading novels before for many reasons: boredom, dull plot, poor characterization, or just plain bad writing but NEVER have I stopped reading because I got to angry/depressed to continue. It seems poor Marilyn couldn't buy a break."
2,The Pits!,"I adore Marilyn Monroe. I have read numerous biographies and novels based on her life. Of everything I have read in the last 15 or so years, this is the absolute worst. This book was very disjointed and hard for me to follow. On many occasions characters in the book were given initals instead of names which made it even harder to follow. Worst of all, it was just plain boring. I am not one to give up on a book without finishing it and I toiled through this one down to the very last page and I cannot say it ever captured my heart or my attention. I would not recommend this book to anyone but particularly not to anyone who considers themself a fan of Marilyn."
4,masterful prose -- long but worth it,"Just because a writer produces many works should not mandate that we ignore new output -- like many of Oates' earlier works, the writing is breathtaking. I have to admit that since I'm in my early 30's, Marilyn Monroe per se holds little interest for me, but Oates' insights into the human condition and her winding prose held me to the very end of this 700 + page book. I would encourage readers who like well-written, literary works to give this a try even if the topic does not interest you. Its gives special pleasure to read the work of a great 20th century voice who is still living. Yes, much of the book is depressing, especially the early chapters about her attachment to her crazy mother and her search for love and affection. Despite the somber tone, the prose itself breathes life into the subject and shows hope. It made me want to find and read more of Oates' earlier works."
3,Interesting fiction.,"This is a really great novel, as long as you're not looking for anything super accurate about Marilyn Monroe (who the book is ostensibly about). I quite enjoy Joyce Carol Oates, and from that perspective I thought this book was great. However some of the subjects she glosses over or mixes together are almost appallingly inaccurate and clearly based on some shoddy biographies rather than good, original research.Still a solid novel, and a pretty decent summer read of the more ""literary"" sort."
3,Classic Oates,"I read everything I can get my hands on written by Joyce Carol Oates. Never was a character more suitable for a novel by Oates than Marilyn Monroe. One must remember when reading this novel that, as the author warns, the book is a work of fiction based on the life of Monroe. I was fascinated by the book, but I was both saddened and repulsed by the main character. Oates does a wonderful job of reacreating the fog in which her character lived, but this is often disconcerting for the reader. I've commented that I don't think someone who wasn't an Oates fan would make it through this book. What it did do was make me want to read a nonfiction account of the life of Marilyn Monroe."
5,Oates's masterpiece,"Oates has written some great novels in the past, but in ambition and skill of execution this tops them all. I'm puzzled by reviewers who have some kind of personal attachment to the historical Marilyn Monroe and do not understand that A NOVELIST, as opposed to a biographer, has unlimited freedom to reinvent and mythologize a cultural icon in the service of an artistic statement about our culture and our century. This Oates has done brilliantly in BLONDE. And not least of its achievements is that (unlike some of her more experimental works), this is a gripping, compelling ""great read."" Don't deny yourself the pleasure of this enthralling masterpiece."
5,Fan-bloody-tastic!,"This book is one of the most heart-wrenching novels I have ever read. I had never seen any of MM's movies, and knew basically nothing about her before reading this book... afterward, I went out and rented everything. There is something so empathetic and real about Oates' Marilyn... she's just a normal girl who got caught up in something much bigger than herself. Maybe it's not a good sign for my own sanity that I understood the way Monroe thought, talked, and phrased things. But this book truly brought me closer to this lovely, tragic, modern-day royalty than I ever would have dreamed possible. If you read one book, read this one. It is a powerful, moving testiment to a 1950's woman in a man's world."
1,total trash,"I thought publishers hired editors, not here. I still suspect authors are paid per word...700 pages could easily have been reduced to 300. How many times need you mention her father left, and Norma never knew him? Is it really helpful to describe the decorum of her Mother's nursing home in much depth?And what is this ""ex athelte""; blonde actress"", Mr W, TC? We are all aware as to the referal. Ms Oates even refers to Ms Monroe by her screen names roles. It always bothers me when imtimate conversations, and emotional feeling are conveyed as though this is based on....interviews with the dead? One would be mislead to believe Ms Monroe was an acting genius able to influence her directors. Perhaps, this is based on Ms Oates own ability to convice the editor to publish this trash. Any future for Ms Oates exists in the tabliods. Martlot"
1,BOOOORRRRIIIINNNNGGGGG!,"Couldn't get past the first few pages. Hard to follow. Boring. If you're a Monroe fan, save your money because this book is definitely not worth purchasing. Sorry Joyce---try again!"
4,Sad but addictive reading,"I enjoyed the book even though it was pretty bleak and mostly depressing but how could it be otherwise? Monroe's life wasn't exactly the happily ever fantasy what with her rough beginning, the abuse, the sex and the drugs. I thought Oates did an enviable job of recreating Monroe's voice, her motivation and getting to the heart of the woman behind the myth. It begins with Monroe as a young child and portrays the abuse she suffers at the hands of an unstable mother and sets the ground work for Marilyn's unsuccessful search for a normal life which clashes time and time again with her overwhelming drive to become a successful and important actress."
2,Even The Best Authors Can't Always Be Great,"Oates is fond of taking iconic figures (Marilyn Monroe in Blonde) and watershed events in American history (Ted Kennedy's Chappaquiddick incident in Black Water; the Detroit riots in them) and novelising them. Usually Oates is dead-on in her re-workings of fact but in Blonde, she misses the mark. I know some people who read this long, stumbling book and liked it, but they were major fans of Monroe. Personally I found the story uninteresting, the message of tragedy and blame unworthy of the intricate genius of Oates, and the Marilyn of the novel less exploited and pre-programmed to failure, as Oates wished her to seem, and more of an annoying fool too hamstrung by her own inability to learn from mistakes to successfully manage her own ambitions. Joyce Carol Oates is still one of the greatest writers in American letters, but in Blonde she fails to deliver a work that meets her own lofty hopes for the ideas out of which it grew."
2,Another misfire from JCO,"I'm am a very big fan of JCO. I've read them all and I have tosay that Blonde is a huge dissapointment in everyway especially aftera lame Broke Heart Blues. The character of Marilyn is just a cookie cut out from her previous novels. Another woman excessing about bodily fluids and functions and being a poor abused waif. I didn't find the story compelling or interesting even though it was about Marilyn. I'm not sure if this book was a ploy for JCO to get more readers by writing a story about a popular person. New readers I';m sure will wonder what all the hype was about. Here was a missed chance for JCO to get the acclaim she deserves. Blonde for me, will be the last book I buy automatically before a review. I wish she had spent her time writing a novel that made her explore her many talents as a writer. END"
5,Better than the other reviews,"I read the other reviews and was disappointed in them. JCOates is an incredible writer for starters (having read several other of her books) and she chose a superstar icon as her subject...getting perhaps too close to the truth for some. Her portrait is profound. She imagines a reality that may or may not be close to the truth, we have to remember that, but she got the essesnce of NJBaker and MM as I have understood her. I wasn't at all disturbed by her technique of using titles instead of names: The Author, The President, ""C"", etc., just added to the bit of mystery that was MM. Face it, most people wouldn't have survived her life. Bravo, Ms Oates. A fine read. I am now going to read the MM biographies, however, and create some balance in my mind and heart."
4,Hey...,"Am just here to say that I liked this book, contrary to many other reviewer's views. I guess, from reading the comments, that one will either hate or love this book. Joyce Carol Oates has a very original, thought-provoking prose style that presents Marilyn Monroe wonderfully. Read if you have spare time and find the idea of Marilyn interesting."
3,endlob,"Endlob is, obviously, Blonde spelled backwards and all mixed up, and that is how I feel after reading the book. It probably didn't help that I managed to finish it in 3 days (sick in bed and not being able to sleep), pulling an all-nighter that last night just so I could finish it. No, it wasn't because it is a non-stop page turner. In fact, I had to force myself through the first few chapters and was at times turned off by the author's style of writing. What kept me reading was the subject matter. Marilyn. Insanity. Drug use. Hollywood. Sex. I don't know how much liberty the author took (or how liabelous she was) in interpreting Marilyn's history because I never really read much about her before... dismissing her as simply, fluff. Now, however, I want to know the real truth. I also want to shake off this depression. And if JFK was really all that ""Mr. President"" was, Clinton, in my opinion is a saint."
2,If you have a bit of respect for Marilyn don't read it,"The Editorial Review says: ""If you like biographies, you'll like Blonde. If you like novels, you'll like Blonde. If you like mysteries, you'll like Blonde"".I like biographies, I like novels and I like mysteries. But I hate Blonde. For me Marilyn counts more than the literary aspects of the novel. If your a Marilyn fan-you'll hate Blonde.It's another degrading book about Marilyn. Who cares if it's fictious or not - the line between the truth and fiction (lies?) regarding Marilyn's life is blurred enough already but this book makes it disappear. People know that it's fiction but they forget about it while reading it and soon everyone thinks it's all true. If you don't know anything about Marilyn from other books, please don't read it. For Marilyn's sake."
1,Unreadable,"The famous are victims of us all - poor Marilyn, psychoanalyzed by a great writer gone amuck. I found this book self-indulgent, excessive, unremitting and completely lacking in insight for her main character. I gained more understanding of Marilyn's personality from Norman Mailer's self-indulgent tome on this sad actress. Of course, this book gets by under the guise of fiction ... whatever, I could not finish it."
1,"Awful and pretentious, eh?","I kept from reading this novel because of all the terrible reviews it was getting all over the place; but then I decided no novel could be that bad. I was wrong--it's worse. The prose is at times undecipherable, and I kept reading only to see whether it would become even worse. It did. Ostensibly the story of Norma Jeane who became Marilyn Monroe, it amounts to drivel, hot-house imaginings about another's sexual life, pretentious pronouncements about acting and just about everything else Oates can conjure up, including (really!) stuffed birds. And why does every character have to end sentences with, ""Eh?"" .... And pretentious? Oh, my, just glance through all the italicized passages and you'll get an idea, just a hint, of how awful the whole thing is. I've never read any of Oates' other novels, dozens and dozens, but this one is enough. More than enough."
5,Blonde,"Miss Oates style is at first hard for me but once I get the cadence I love every minute of it. I've read several of the books including Brokeheart Blues. This is the best I've read. She gets to the very heart of Marilyn. I think she understands her better that the people who knew her. Her vague, spacey interest in the intellectual life which was never encouraged. Her great need to be loved so apparent in her very appearance.Her fasination with death and dying was part of this complex personality. She was more that a pretty face.The writing style was so poetic.Thank you for a wonderful experience."

5,Great Gun,This thing is great coming out of the box. It fires fast enough for any woodsball game and has pretty good distance and accuracy. The electic hopper is also a very nice feature.... jut make sure you bring an extra battery with you
1,I had to return my copy,"No one is a stauncher men's libber and supporter of men's rights than I am, but this book was so lousy that I had to send it back. Sieberman comes across as the sort of guy who rushes out of his house to yell at the kids to get off of his lawn. The writing was only marginally coherent, and while I might agree with some of his anti-feminist positions they just weren't approached from the right perspective IMO. I think he really missed the point, and he made me feel somewhat embarassed to be on basically the same side of many of the issues he dealt with. There are many much much better books out there which handle these topics better."
4,Another side of Faulkener,"My wife worked for the Greenville,, MS paper and knew the author. She thought the book might give me some insights since I teach some Faulkener in my adjunct English Comp class. It did; an enjoyable read, but things end quickly when Faulkener severs the friendship, which had lasted a logn time. The reader can guess at what might have happened,but no one will ever know."
4,"Great book ,very exciting.",You should really try to track this book down as it is very well written and a exciting story.
4,"Good, esp if you like detente/defense issues.","If you're interested in the nuclear arms limitation issue, this is an intelligent, well-researched novel. Author is a talented entertainer, if not the master of the mystery craft."
4,Good Product for Older Players?,Bought this for my son who plays tackle football and just got braces. It is a nice guard just not for him. Kind difficult for him to take in and out of his mouth as much he like to without too much of a hassle. It does open and close so technically you dont need to take it out. He Ended up going with a regular mouth guard. Quick delivery.
4,Reasons for R&D Internationalization,"This book provides an excellent summary of the most important factors leading to todays internationalization of R&D, including types of R&D centres, variations of coordination and success factors.120 easy to read pages."
3,"Good movies, TERRIBLE transfer.....","These are good movies; of the two I liked ""Guilty Concience"" better, but that's just a preference -- ""Blunt"" was quite interesting as well. The price is right too.However, this is a NASTY tansfer. Obviously vidoe source, cheap, careless transfer, audio noise & hiss so bad that the dialog is often unintelligible, wobbly color, and sectors so bad that my DVD player choked and to be forced to skip the chapter.Personally, I'd be careful about any DVDs from this publisher."
3,"Read this, not Gavin","This is a well-meant and partly successful effort. De Valk likes or at least judges his subject with restraint. After reading James Gavin's depressing, bloated, and thoroughly jive claptrap (as detestable as the equally bogus ""Let's Get Lost"") this book was a welcome remedy. Not great, by any means, but it's terse and direct. His biography just 'gives us the facts, ma'am', and trusts our intellect to do the rest. De Valk's annoted bibliography also reveals a true jazz fan/scholar's desire to inform and share about Chet Baker the MUSICIAN.He's nicer to the people in Baker's life, too.Worthwhile."
5,another review from Boston Ma.,"I found the book most helpful in learning about Chet Baker. Grateful for the reviews of the music, it steered me right to incredible finds. If it loses something in the translation to english, the information is there for those interested."
5,Cadillac Capo,This is the Cadillac of capos. Not to say that alot of the others won't work just fine but I really like this thing. Wish it was a little cheaper but it is well made.
2,"Looks nice, but not impressed","This capo looks amazing, but it does not hold well. You cannot get the pressure of a Shubb or other similar capos. Consequently the sound it produces is not as clean. As has been said, this also contributes to other problems. The guitar does not stay in tune while using this capo and bending strings, or during hard strumming. It is also more expensive. I would send it back if it were worth my time. I would not recommend this capo or buy it again."
3,It's Okay,Doesn't hold as well as my shubb but it's okay. Would have liked it to have been cheaper considering it doesn't do a whole lot of special stuff like play your guitar for you!
5,Simply the best capo I have ever used,"The G 7th performance capo has blown me away. When I have played with other capos, I sometimes had issues with them dampening my sound. This is NOT the case with the G 7th performance. The capo works perfectly in its basic function, that is having a crisp clean hold on the neck. Also, this has been the quickest capo I have ever used, in the sense that is takes moments to reposition. Plus, to put a cherry on top, it has a very sleek appearance. Totally worth it to pay the extra money compared to other capos. I haven't had mine long but I know of many who have had theirs for several years and it functions like brand new every time.Bottomline, this capo is the capo for people who want performance, durability, and would appreciate a good looking capo."
5,Great,Great quality sounds amaazzing by far the best capo out there 5 stars would recoomend it to anyone. Great Product!.
5,Perfect fit everytime!!,"Just one thing to say about this capo......AWESOME!!!!!I have read the reviews on this capo and have used one in the past. Finally decided to get one for myself. It perfectly fits the fretboard and provides the ""just right"" pressure needed to bring out the best tone in your guitar. Whether you are a serious player or a casual player, it would be a great investment. This capo stays out of your way while you are playing. Its extremely durable as well. They even sell replacement grips!!! To sum it all up: ""You get what you pay for and this one is definitely at the top of the list!!!! Have a great one!"
5,Love it,"Purchased for my husband and he said, ""I love it, works really well, easy to use, and seems to be very well made."
5,"CAPO AS IN GUITAR ACCESSORY, NOT MAFIA",ONCE IT'S IN PLACE IT DOESN'T MOVE AND THE GUITAR STAYS IN TUNE. THERE IS REALLY NOTHING ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT IT IS A GREAT VALUE AND EVEN LOOKS VERY EDGY IN A GOOD WAY.
5,Should last me a few decades!!,"My last capo dates from the 1970's. Worked well, but I always had to worry about gouging the neck of the guitar.This capo is simple, doesn't interfere with my hand position and provides a tight pressure on the strings at almost every fret. The first and second frets require just a bit of positioning to get it just right.I rarely used a capo in my playing, but this capo makes on/off so easy,that I am using it a lot more.Well made piece, looks good and was a great purchase."
5,I just came here to review this capo.,"I was using Kayser's capo for 1 year till the metal broke off. (I've been using it 3 to 4 hours every day).I was getting constant string buzz and thought maybe it is my cheap guitar that is making that noise.after using this capo for a week, I haven't heard any string buzz! and it is solidly built!I am going to buy one more for my electric guitar. this is an awesome capo!"
5,Just right!!!,"I previously reviewed this capo and stated that it might not intonate or function well unless your guitar has a light action. That being said, I just purchased a new Seagull acoustic and decided to test my theory. Turns out I was right. This thing works very well on the new guitar, allowing just the right amount of pressure to be applied. With the right guitar, intonates perfectly. (and looks very sleek.)"
3,G7 Disappoints!,"I was excited at the prospect of finally getting a Capo that a. does not impede my playing and b. does not require re-tuning. Well folks, this AIN'T it! For $40 I can definitely buy 2 and possibly 2&1/2 Shubb Capos, which don't impede as much, still require a bit of re-tuning but aren't as nice looking or as easy to use as the G7. The G7 is good looking, sleekly designed and extremely easy to use. But again, at $40 (I know, stupid me!) I would stick with the Shubb and/or keep looking!"
3,"It's OK, but barely","I just received the G7th capo from Amazon and couldn't wait to try it out. It works OK, it's easy to use - one hand or two and it looks nice. Big problem, though...It dampens the tone of the guitar more than any other capo I have ever used - and that's a lot of capos over a 45 year tenure. I was shocked by how much it dampened the tone, so I checked it against other handy capos - Shubb S1, Kayser, even a lever action G7th. The verdict to my old ears...the new G7th gets returned for a refund. On the plus side, the Shubb provides the cleanest tone of all and is the least ""in the way"" when attached. I guess you could say I'm a Shubb man!"
1,Its not even wood,They feel like a mix between cardboard and Styrofoam my hamsters wont go near them and who can blame them?
4,Seem nice,"I dont know if it's just my hamster or what, but he doesn't care for these much. I dont consider it a waste of money because it was cheap and a simple add-on to my main purchase, its worth a buy, see if your hamster likes it :)"
2,There are better Buffalo books out there,"I got this book because I plan to go buffalo hunting some day and I am reading all that I can on the subject. This book had some interesting stories, but it is not that great a book. Boddington on Buffalo is great."
5,Horned Death by John Burger,"This is a very interesting book. I enjoyed the stories leading up to the actually conflict of man and beast. It isfilled with griping tales and suspense. You become asorbed, just as if you are the one hunting the dangerous andcrafty buffalo, make a mistake and it will cost you, most likely your life. There are grave yards in Africa that house many hunters, that under estimated the ability of the dangeous ""buff"". If you like hunting dangeous game,then you will like this book! Best prices were on Amazon!"
3,Okay but passable,"The story itself is weak and in parts, it does come together. While watching I thought it is just a copy of ""pulp fiction"" complete with psycho.The acting is okay. Snipes is about the best and at least his character has some character.The filming is good.If you have an hour or two to kill it is okay."
5,hard luck,"wesley snipes is at the top of my list as a favorite actor for years. he can act out any type role. this one was a mixture of seriousness and comic. enjoyed the entire movie. this was the first time i had seen this movie and had not heard of this one. i recommend this movie to others that enjoy watching wesley snipes, the actor."
5,Great Speakers - Just Remember Placement!,"I got these speakers over 2 years ago and am still loving them. I have them hooked up to a Denon 3808 and use them mostly for movies and my playstation 3. I am still thoroughly impressed with the sound quality. The sub provides great thump with practically no muddy sounds. The center provides great voices and all of them are great for music.As with any speaker, make sure you place them about at listening level. I've moved twice since owning these units and it made a huge difference. My first place there were physical impracticalities associated with listening level and man did it make a difference at my new place. Everything sounded so crisp!"
3,"Mediocre quality of sound from satellites, good sub and center","I have read good reviews of other buyers and that shaped my decision to buy this speaker system. However, when I bought and installed this system I was rather disappointed with the quality of sound from satellites. My full range JVC speakers (supposedly lower end) produced much richer sound. Sub did make a difference but could not compensate for the dullness of sound coming from the satellites. Center speaker is not bad. I have Yamaha RX-V663 receiver and receiver has been proven to produce excellent sound with other speakers."
2,Sigh.,"The only reason I read this book was because a coworker gave me a bag full of used books (including a few Savage books) and I can't say that I was impressed by this book. I mean, Gray Wolf tries to have sex with Danette so soon after meeting her - even a 'savage' knows better than that, especially a kind/honorable one like Gray Wolf.I hated Danette's vacillating attitude and her wanting to go back and forth. Yes, she might be a bit afraid to leave familiarity behind, but it just wasn't handled well in this story. I also didn't like his attitude towards her or the first child they had. So Gray Wolf didn't like the baby because it looked white? Come on, that's what happens when you yourself are half-white and the woman you take is white, too. I also found the ending rather cliched, and the ending line was just... ew. I can't really recommend this book to anyone."
5,Outstanding Incredible Sound!!!!,"I was pleasantly surprised after first listening to this amazing device. It has plenty of warm, rich, pure sound; with no shortage of bass. It is difficult to fathom the sound that this thing generates.More accurate sound than the Bose. Best 300 dollars I've spent!"
2,Does Not Fit iPhone,"I'm ticked...the product lists the iPhone 3G and 3GS as compatible...and it does work with it...but the iPhone doesn't fit into the well, so it's loose; and thus if you were to, say...take this to the beach, or walk with it, your iPhone will probably fall out. How would you feel about that?It's just not cool, you know?So, there ya go. It works, but it doesn't fit.Good luck with that. Mine's going back."
2,Danger!,"This product looks cool but it has big problems delivering a quality product. I ordered one for my dad. It arrived at his place with one leg different than the other three. This meant it wouldn't sit level. Okay, accidents happen I understand, so he sent it back to exchange it for one with four legs that were the same. When the replacement came, BAM, one leg was different again. Buyer beware, I don't think this one can leg it out over the competition."
5,Amazing Sound - Very Portable,"The Harman Kardon sounds GREAT!! Even when I have it playing inside, you can hear it outside in the backyard! Anyone I've shown it to, gets a smile on their face when I turn it up.It's hard to believe this little thing sounds sooo good. Base is rich and the sound is crisp. Couldn't have asked for more."
5,dock,"We love the dock station, the sound is what we were looking for without paying a fortune, bass is real good, volume is more that enough. Very clear, compares to the Bows. Don't mind going up to it to see the i-pod for changing, would need to get close anyway to see; love the remote! it's a hit in our music loving family!"
4,"Loud, crystal clear sound, great bass, with a couple design flaws.","Sounds better (and plays LOUDER) than the Bose. Had an Altec Lansing iM7 before this, which also had great sound, but didn't play as loud, and had shoddy construction (ipod dock ""door"" broke after less than 3 years.)First the negatives: Handle blocks view of docked iPod (which faces up). Makes it harder to use the iPod also. Remote light as a feather and feels delicate and a bit cheap. No bass and treble controls. Newer model ipods will not charge in dock. (supposedly latest model fixes this issue though)Now the positives: Outstanding crystal-clear sound with surprising bass and ridiculous volume when cranked. Handle is a sturdy, comfortable design for transport. Remote is RF(!) so you don't even have to point it at the boombox and have line of sight to function."
1,Worst company ever to deal with,"Harmon Kardon is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with. I ordered this product directly from their website. Just call their number from their website. I have been trying to reach somebody there for that last 4 day. Everyday I am on hold more than an hour and then I give up. I sent emails to their customer service (btw they say they prefer email and they duly respond to emails) and I have never received any response. I will never buy any product from a company that doesn't care about their customers like this. These guys are supposed to be premium audio, but if they don;t care about their customers I can only imagine the quality of their products."
5,Excellent Product,"I am a research executive by trade and as a result reviewed many IPOD speakers before making the purchase of the Harmon Kardon unit. They were a X-Mas present for my teenage son. While more money than most this speaker is durable, has great sound, and unbelievable base response. I own 2 sets of the Bose speakers that so many people praise and both sets failed in less than one year due to a faulty cord connection in the back of the unit. The Bose cost the same as the Harmon Kardon's, but in my view every aspect of the Harmon Kardon speakers are superior, especially the build quality."
4,excellent sound,"It has excellent bass, it sounds like a big amplifier.It would have been better if you can take a better look at the ipod screen, the handle obstructs the view. The remote control works excellent."
5,duuuuuuuude - this is one sweet ipod dock,"Okay - it's expensive, but the sound on this dock is amazing - not to mention the fact that it is far from the eyesore that so many ipod docks are.We have this one prominently displayed in our living room, and when it is on you can hear it clearly all through the house. The remote is great as well; it works from almost any room in the house!My wife was skeptical when I asked for this for Christmas, but I think she has been converted.It is solid, with great sound and great style.Can't miss!"
5,The best of its kind,"I tried various brands Sony, Bose etc, and as a professional musician and studio artist, I can say this has the best sound for an iPod player. It is perfectly equalized, and very powerful for its size. The remote is very handy also, being rf, and able to switch between playlists. Very well thought machine. The only strange problem is the iPod docks under the handle, not the most ergonomic design, but who cares about such a minor inconvenience, when everything else is so perfect."
2,"Boyd & Cilla's story is ONE star, Deborah & Gage's Story Only marginally better","Nora Roberts is usually a master storyteller, but Boyd & Cilla's story moved at an excruciatingly slow pace. Cilla wasn't even pleasant and Boyd came off as an overbearing doof, when I'm sure he could have been much more if he'd had a different heroine and a different story. I appreciate that Ms Roberts did her research into radio DJs, but after the initial set-up of Cilla's occupation, it got really boring.Gage & Deborah were a bit more interesting, but not much. At least they were likable people."
1,Predictable and uninspired,"I bought Nora Roberts' latest book in conjunction with Stella Whitelaw's newest book and a really great emerging author, Lori Davis. I have to admit, although I have been a fan of Roberts in the past, this book (a two for one deal)was a disappointment. The hero is the predictable burly, strong, silent type who must swoop in and rescue the damsel in distress. This theme has been exhausted in all of Roberts' books. Enough already. Time to think outside the box. Readers crave more than the usual recycled tripe."
2,Too short for closure; not Roberts' best,"I liked ""Night Shadow"" better than ""Night Shift,"" but both of these were shorter than they could have been and I would have liked. Just didn't feel there was enough time to get through all the plot points. The characters seemed more ""real"" and were more likeable in ""Night Shadow."""
1,An abomination,"I'm a fan of ROMANCE, this was rape pornography. The author buys into the old canard that ""The difference between rape and seduction is salesmanship."" If you abuse her physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually enough that she believes she wants it, it's no longer rape. It perpetuates the destructive myth that women REALLY want to be forced, they just don't know it. And if your body is forcibly aroused, you really want it.I'm giving it one star only because I can't give negative stars. The author should be ashamed to let this obscene story see the light of day. And other women should be ashamed to let her get away with it."
3,Baby Boy Bank,This is a cute bank for a baby boy. I really like how it has a lid on the top so you can easily open it and put bills in it. It also has a slot for coins. The front has a small picture frame to put your baby's picture. I was disappointed in the size of the box though. It's roughly 4 inches by 3 inches. It's a nice gift for a new baby or baptism.
3,Cute Bank..,This is a super cute bank but it is only made of cardboard material. I am afraid it will fall apart soon.
2,Had to glue it together,It was not as I expected. I had to glue many things back on and the lining inside back to the sides. But when I got it glued back together it was OK. I had to use it so I tried to do what I could.
3,Not really what I expected,"I haven't been inspired by this book to try anything they suggest. It all looks rather awkward. Maybe at a later time. For now, it will just sit on the shelf gathering dust."
1,"Not a romance, or a vampire book.","I was hoping to see what Thea Devine could do with a paranormal plot, but was very disappointed. She is a GREAT writer, with her other books always pushing the envelope and having elaborate plots with trademark character buildup.What happened here? The heroine gets no development time, leaving us to think for the whole book that she is just a TSL (too stupid to live) gold digger. The whole plot, what there is of it, involves the two MALE characters playing foil off of one another. The heroine is merely background, except that the furniture was described better than she.A vampire romance where neither the hero nor the heroine is the vampire doesn't work. Even if the hero is pretending to be the vampire, or whatever he is doing.The ending is given 4 pages from the being in the middle of the plot, into a resolution that doesn't make sense. Still no idea why the pair got together -- all they did in this book is have rough sex, and almost no conversation.Skip this one."
3,"Good story, bad editing","The story line is pretty good, if confusing at times, but the poor editing job done on this book really irks me. I know Thea Devine's writing style is very unique and probably hard to edit, but come on! If I was her I would be absolutely livid at how many mistakes the editors did not pick up on. It takes away from the story and is quite a distraction. Otherwise, this review isn't very helpful for deciding whether or not you'll like the book, it's just a warning to be on guard for numerous typos and a heads up to the editors at Kensington - spend a little more time on the copyediting in the future!"
1,Flame of Barbary Coast,"The quality of this DVD was so poor, much of the movie was inaudible and very grainy. One of my chief complaints is that Amazon.com provides no feed back after the merchandise is received.Also, I wish Amazon.com would provide a wish list for items they currently don't carry or are unavailable at the time. That way they would have some idea of how many people would be interested in an item and they might then add it to their inventory."
4,Another great product for your Visor,"This is an excellent module for a Handspring Visor. I got this for my fiancee' for his birthday. It is the only 56K modem available for the Visor and it is the smallest and lightest modem of all. Its additional 8MB of memory makes it even better. The only flaw I saw with it was the browser software it came with did not work well at all. We had to go on Handspring's site and get a different browser. But as far as functionallity and ability, I highly recommend this modem."
5,Should make every American angry,"This is a very good overview of William Heirens case. Dolores Kennedy did a very good job with a complicated and long story. I wish that everyone could read this book. What happened to Mr. Heirens is a travesty of justice. What is really hard to understand is the fact that he is still in prison today. I urge you to buy this book. I feel for the families of the victims, but keeping an innocent man locked up for 63 years is compounding the tragedy. I do not know why it is evident to me and so many other people that he is innocent, yet nothing is ever done.Melissa A."
5,Sven Kirsten defines an era!,"Truly a wonder of nature this Book of Tiki. Chances are, you might so your parents or grandparents in the pictures, from the days before you considered them old.The text of the book goes briefly through the various sources of Polynesian pop-culture, and where it branched off. From Michener's South Pacific, to the Lanai apartments in Anytown, USA.The pictures, brought through the archives of time in the form of various postcards and of the now empty lots that once were Tiki bowling alleys and apartments, show us a fascinating time of tehnicolor wonder and primitive naivete. This was before PC was PC.All around, a fantastic read, whether you're a full on tiki freak, or you simply wonder why grandpa wore a Hawaiian shirt to your wedding."
5,Beyond Cool,"This book is a total hoot, part serious scholarship, part tongue-in-cheek good natured sarcasm, always funny, and a great collection of the polynesian-hawaiin craze memorabilia. Anthropology with a happy face!"
5,Perfect!!,Item came quickly and exactly as described. I am so happy to finally have this book! It is just what I wanted.
5,A much needed effort,"Tiki worshipers -- we are not alone! Our friends at LuxuriaMusic.com live and breath Tiki, and the Millionaire has kindly written a thoughtful review on ""The Book of Tiki."" A notable excerpt from this is:""Possibly the most difficult aspect of reviewing this comprehensive study of Polynesian pop is that it stands alone, unassailable. It's difficult to apply any critical distance to a work like this, and it's not that nothing else approaches its thoroughness or insight: the fact is that there is simply nothing else of the sort available. Whatsoever. Anywhere. Kirsten has literally ""written the book"" on a phase of pop culture that once encompassed architecture,interior design, clothing, music, food, entertainment and much more, yet passed from a ubiquitous vogue to decay and disregard without ever having enjoyed critical respect or even any substantial recognition."
5,good model to put together,"this aircraft, the SBD Dauntless, is fairly easy to put together and required very little filler putty to make things look right. I took a cordless drill and a small drill bit and drilled out the air brakes so that they wouldn't look too phony...the only thing that makes this model look odd is the cockpit area. The cockpit looks kinda cheesy so I just glued the windows closed and called it a day. Testors spray dark and light grey worked wonderful in creating an even paint job and the stickers went on easy and looked realistic!! Anyway, great product with very easy assembly."
3,Revel Model,While Revel has been in the model making a long time it appears they are reducing their scale as the 1: 48 appears much smaller than I remember of previous ones.
2,Poor quality for price,Received the model and noted that some crucial parts had not been molded properly and the pieces would not fit properly. Loved the moving parts like the dive flaps just wish the wings were molded and every thing fit together.
1,Get the original,This edition obviously has today's typical junk illustrations. Get the original which has truly artistic images to accompany an amazing and wonderful story.
5,Provides updates relating to Volume One only,"Just to be precise, this supplement only provides updates regarding java packages in Volume One, not Volumes One and Two both, as one reader indicated. The authors were thoughtful enough to include complete class summaries for those classes which were revised in any way. Thus, they did a fine job in compiling the supplement."
4,Almost wonderful,"While the contents of the book as a wonderful as Volumes 1 & 2, I have to drop a star based on the utility of the format. Besides the class library additions, there are updates to classes in the other volumes. Collating the three volumes can be a pain. Still, it's better than waiting for a third edition."
5,leo the lop,"I actually bought several Serendipity books to send to my niece in Oregon. I'd read some of them as a child (and admittedly still read them occasionally now). I had this book as a child, and I read it again as soon as it arrived, and I have to say, it is wonderful. The Serendipity series is something that you should keep forever, and read every now and again. It really does explain, simplify, and drive home many things that even we as adults struggle to grasp."
1,Good Directing,"I like Mattie Rich. He is a very good Director. However, I never liked this movie. I entails too much on the point that there is no way out for the African - American of the 60's and 70's. True we don't have a great past, and true we are the only race since the days of Nebekenezer that was forced to another land just to be enslaved, but it is clear that there is always hope for freedom in every aspect of life. Straight Out Of Brooklyn is a lie."
5,One of the best of the urban realism films,"Excellent screen play and performance by George T. Odom, as a Husband and Father who somehow missed out on the new opportunities of the Great Society; he's intelligent and so is his son, Dennis, played impressively by Lawrence Gilliard, Jr., who is not willing to settle for a gas station job; and a stop at the bar on the way home. Where a wife waits for psychological and sometimes physical abuse.Dennis forgos his College education, so he and his two friends can go for the ""easy money"". He feels the System works that way...just on a larger scale. His view of Red Hook is that it is permanently in the shadow of Manhattan. Books can wait.The Director makes the most of apparent location shots; and some supporting actors with marginal acting skills.Overall, this movie, despite some rough edges and unreachable aspirations, is worthy of an Oscar, in the writing and acting department - the latter speaking of George T. Odom."
2,"Was watchable, and had a decent storyline","I noticed most of the cast didn't go on to other things, but this movie was ok. Even though, it came first, but it is sort of a ""Menace II Society"" wannabe. Not a great movie, but decent if you want drama."
3,An interesting insight into the life of Princess Alice,"I expected the author to go into more detail in the lives of Alice's children and grandchildren. Instead the book focused on Princess Alice and her elder daughter, Victoria, Marchioness of Milford Haven, giving less time into the lives of the remaining children, except where tragedy played a part. The sad life of Prince Ernest and Tsarina Alexandra and their families, the strain of hemophilia, war and revolution. Still an enjoyable book, that really delved into the life and personality of Princess Alice. Of her early life, marriage, family and charitable works."
4,Common sense approach,"If you are looking for a magic bullet do not purchase this book. But if real, down-to-earth suggestions for getting out from under the monster of debt is what you are looking for buy this book and apply the concepts. They are easy and effective."
5,Happy user,"I ordered two copies of this book for myself and my daughter and now my niece requested to have a copy, so I will be ordering this book for her birthday in Fed. I am very happy with Amazon."
4,Fun,"This book was pure fun! Peter Stark who has written on winter sports for Outside magazine, has penned some interesting and informative essays on his lifelong fascination with snow, the Arctic and winter sports. The author packed up a 1974 Volkswagon minibus and set out to drive to Greenland. Full of fun escapades and musings on that wonderful fluffy, white stuff-snow."
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY VHS!!!,"This is the video title for A Swingin' Summer with Raquel Welch. Don't wast your money--HORRIBLE quality!!!! This stupid video company put two videos taped on EP in a boxed set. Why not put both films on one tape if it's on EP??? Anyway, the quality is just awful-- don't waste your money as I did. There is a version of A Swingin' Summer on VHS taped in the SP mode (it's not available on DVD)."
3,Including instructions and less scratched would be nice.,"This came unassembled and I had to decipher from the picture on Amazon.com how to put it together so it would attach properly to my basement drain hole. Took off a star for not including instructions because if I had never owned this product before (unfortunately I threw away the old one before obtaining the new one) I would have no clue as to how to assemble it for use. Once assembled, it fits well. Not happy that the one I received was terribly scratched up (took off a star for that)."
4,charming account of English coastal sailing in the 20's,"The Magic of the Swatchways is a collection of stories and annecdotes written by the author during the decade following the first World War. His knowledge of the Thames estuary, the fisheries and the wildlife is extensive and authentic. Griffith's knowledge of the local people and local craft provide the substance for his accounts, yet there is an easy charm and a timelessness to these stories which sets them apart from others of the genre. The book is among the best of the type."
5,Very pleased!,Was hesitant to order on line. Gave it a try and I am quite pleased with the product and delivery service.Thank you! Will most probably order thru Amazon again.
3,"Good product, fair price","The books is a great addition to anyone's library, it will challenging even the most experienced negotiator as it reminds you of those often forgotten points that make the difference between a good and great negotiator."
2,mind and heart of the negotiator book,"Book is for school, seems like an excuse to over-complicate common sense negotiation ideas and terms."
3,Oops. Where's my book?,"The only complaint that I have about this is how long it took to get to me. It came from Kentucky and went to Illinois and took 13 days to get to me. I needed the book for a class and it really put me in a crunch. I ended up having to buy a second book at the bookstore and then luckily they let me return it once I got this book.Other than that, the quality was fine."
2,never received,I placed the order and then the company i bought it from stated it was in the mail. One month has gone by and no book. they are saying that they are invistigating what went wrong. and gave a full refund.
5,Comprehensive and Practical,"As a professor of Organizational Leadeship and Conflict Resolution...as well as a practicing mediator and negotiator, I found this book to be of great interest. There are many books on negotiation that either focus on the simplistic bargaining tactics or the theoretical implications of negotiation. This text skillfully integrates both of these elements providing the reader with a comprehensive viewpoint as it relates to negotiation.Of specific assistance were the many helpful examples and tips placed throughout the book. If I had to criticize the book, I would only say that it is not a simple read per se for the beginning negotiator. That is, there are elements of logic, weighted analysis and such that the novice negotiator may get lost in. Looking past that, there are many helpful tips, tactics and theories that any negotiator could benefit from.Now if the price could just come down a bit (I'm negotiating), then this would be a perfect book for a course on negotiation!"
3,Used in MBA program - not that useful,"We used this book in our negotiations class and actually found Getting to Yes to be more useful. This is one of those textbooks that I have written about in other classes that has a lot of common sense in it but it actually makes thinking about negotiation harder than it really is. The book could easily have been shrunk from 430 pages to about 150 pages. The book actually presents too many things to think about in a negotiation that you end up becoming confused about which strategy to use or how to play defense. Of course, like any book some people might like it but I know myself and other classmates did not find it that helpful."
1,Out of date - out of touch,"This book is not new. Rather it is an reprinting of a twenty year work that has not been undated in any way. Even back in 1980 this tome was seriouly flawed in that it considered the Irish Distillers monopoly of the Irish whiskey market to be ""benine"". As it now stands the book does not even refer to Cooley whiskey, nor the huge growth in the volume of Irish over the past five years. A cynical publishing venture. Full stop."
3,Men's G String Knit Silk Cobalt O/s,"Nice material. WAY to big around the waist. If you are a thin guy will need some sissors, needle and thread."
5,John J. Plenty and Fiddler Dan,"John Ciardi's tale of the grasshopper and the ant is an old one, but it is told in such a charming and delightful manner that you can not help but smile. Our John J. Plenty collects food all spring and summer, but when winter arrives he finds he can not eat it. He is so fearful that if he consumes his food he will eventually starve. He is stunned when his sister (who ran off with the grasshopper whose name was Fiddler Dan) arises come spring fit as a fiddle. I guess it was all that music Dan was playing. The story teaches several important life's lessons not the least of which is ""the world won't turn without a song."" The music of the earth is powerful and beautiful and that was something our intrepid hero didn't know. We can not live our lives in constant fear, but must truly LIVE them to the fullest. This is a classic and should be in every child's collection as well as the young at heart."
4,"Far-out, man!","The H.P. Lovecraft were one of the truly acid-soaked bands of the late sixties. Not in it to commercially benefit from the popularity of psychedlia at the time, but simply tripping, their way through their music. Luckily H.P. Lovecraft consisted of good diciplined muscians, which prevented their music from turning into complete chaos during live-performances. With this album they proved to be able to recreate their trippy studio-sound on stage. It's great stuff to (if you allow it) be taking on a trip by, though watch out for some dark paths they take here and there. This creepy dark aspect reminds me of the Doors. Fortunately, they have a self-assured, upbeat Santana-like jam-quality, to compensate this. Spicy stuff!"
4,"H.P. Lovecraft - 'Live - May 11,1968' (Sundazed)","About as good as their 'H.P.Lovecraft/II' 2-lp's-on-one CD release(see my review).Very nice live archive performance offering of this short-lived psych band that took place at the Fillmore West.Good sound quality,so I can assume it might've been a soundboard recording.If the crowd sounds a bit thin,it's because H.P. was apparently the opening act and much of the crowd hadn't showed up yet.Tunes I thought the group performed extremely well were the ten-minute opener ""Wayfaring Stranger"",""The Drifter"",the trippin' ""At The Mountains Of Madness"" and ""The White Ship"".Line-up:George Edwards-guitar&vocals,Dave Michaels-keyboards&vocals,Jeff Boyan-bass and Michael Tegza-drums.Might appeal to fans of The Seeds,13th Floor Elevators,The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Arthur Brown."
3,"Eclectic, aggressive and fun","Valitsky's album is an interesting collision of styles. Rock and funk rhythms, dissonant bits of melodic heads, some djs and rappers and a few jazz soloists - Thomas Chapin being the best known and the most exciting of them - struggling to be heard in the soup. And they are. A fairly democratic mix, but murky too. Resembles some John Zorn discs and had it been made by him, released as a Tzadik album and mixed/mastered by Allan Tucker it might be considered a classic.Valitsky has not relaased more discs, but it seems he is not gone, he has just gone composing contemporary classical and left this punkjazzalternative thing behind. Whether it's a good or a bad thing I don't know as I've not heard his later compositions, but at least Species Compatibility is a nice album to have and to listen to."
2,"Good brand, but ...","After buying SM5179, I bought SM5180 so I would do both side together. Although 2 mounts were from same seller made by KYB in India, they had different appearances in a few ways, i.e. lug sleeve, direction mark (5180 does not have mark at all), number of bolts (5180 came with 2 sets of bolts). These 2 could be from different batches, but they should meet same KYB standard.I had sent inquiry email to KYB, but I have not received any response. I did put both onto my car and both have worked OK so far."
1,Grinch Belt,"This belt wa smade of very cheap, inferior materials. I wore it once, and the grommet separated from the belt hole after sitting down in my suit. I was very unhappy with the quality and workmanship."
2,It has its moments but it's more suitable to be a TV show that is one hour long.,It has its moments but it's more suitable to be a TV show that is one hour long. Some of the dialogues are humourous and witty. It's obvious some scenes were dragged to make the movie 90 minutes long.
3,ok movie,"Ordered this because I knew Tom Hardy was in it, big fan. Cute flick, well worth the price I paid for it as it was under $5 I believe."
3,Seen This Style Done Better,"Certain scenes are good, and certain scenes could have been cut out. I would probably watch this movie again because there are some interesting lines (here and there). There wasn't a problem with the acting. OFr the most part, the actors did great. However, the story lines were just not that interesting in some cases. Most people have seen films like this by now where viewers are looking in on different people revolving around the same theme, and I just think that I have seen this type of movie done better.If anyone has read some of my other reviews, then they would know that I working my way through Tom Hardy's films. I thought that he was hilarious as Noel when I could hear him."
2,Want to see beautiful aircraft interiors? that's the book,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I expected more design details such as section views, construction details, mechanisms, installation details, venneer application details and so on. I was left disappointed. However, this book is a good source of ideas on the artistic design aspect of aircraft interiors. I wished it could have been more than just a load of pictures."
2,The Magic Christian,The stellar cast is waisted in this clumsy absurdest effort. The movie is pointed but seems to try too hard only to wind-up a bit of a Freudian mess. It's an oddity of its time.
1,Idiotic,"As one who has read and loved the book, I was disappointed by this mindless adaptation. It should have been better--Terry Southern was, first and foremost, a screenwriter and the book itself is a series of hilarious visual images. Read it and skip the video"
4,The Cute One on the Silver Screen Again,it's always so nice to see Ringo. Peter Sellers is such a funny fellow. Knowing that they were good friends makes me wonder what they were putting in thier pipe and smoking while filming. And let's not forget the drinks to wash it down.
2,Searching for contemporary redeeming value,"Certainly this was of a piece with the time it was made and so serves a historical purpose. Perhaps there were many of this sort and there are certainly aspects that point at things like the MP's and the Beatles' own movies -- heck this is Ringo after all. Peter is not the same as many of his other films and that might make for an interesting discussion. My hope was that it would be useful in a classroom situation but I am left searching for a contemporary redeeming value other than remembering how weird things could get, or can get. I can use ""Being There"" but not ""The Magic Christian"". Is it just my own lack of imagination?Certainly the message is not lost on anyone today but neither does anyone need to hear it. Pierre Bourdieu ""Firing Back"" may be ignored as easily. This message is lost to ""Losing Ground"".It at least completes my Peter Sellers collection."
2,The Boring Christian,"Tedious tale of the world's richest man(Sellers) and his adopted son(Ringo) out to prove that people will do anything for money. This results in a series of comic(?) vignettes that are out to prove this point. Many cameos (Raquel Welch, Yul Brynner) that prove to be a waste of our and their time. One of the few times I laughed was during a cameo by John Cleese as an auctioneer. ""Come and Get It"" by Badfinger is played at the beginning and that's pretty catchy. Otherwise, it's a waste of time for both Sellers and Beatles fans."
3,Yul Brynner in drag!!!!,"Normally, this type of comedy is not my thing, but I saw the clip online of Yul Brynner in ""The Magic Christian"" and feel that this vignette alone would be worth ANY price! (Can't imagine the masculine Yul as a woman? HAH He is excellent!!!)"
4,Mocking Greed and Arrogance,"I don't put much significance on the social commentary of movies, but I enjoy this picture's insulting of human greed and pride. And, it is hilarious while doing it. It doesn't even take itself seriously. I think it is very funny while targeting some of Humanity's worst characteristics."
2,Odd,"I saw this in about 1969, a time of ""awakening"" to ideas, but now it seems just odd, off-the-wall, campy. The premise isn't dated though, just terribly dry. I guess movies have become so much more clever since then and my tastes have been honed to higher standards. Peter Sellers is as good as in any other movie but Ringo Starr is just 'okay'. Still, where else can you find a movie with them both and I still love the subject of a 'fool and his money'."
3,"good film, lousy DVD","It's a pity : the audio is often very bad, and the are no extras (like trailers), and the presentation is not in widescreen... I hope that someday someone will issue a better DVD-release"
3,"""Now Getting It Ready for You""","A decidedly uneven, often vicious black comedy adapted from Terry Southern's 1959 novel. Virtually plotless, the satire in director Joseph McGrath's ""The Magic Christian"" (1969) remains hit and miss. Peter Sellers delivers one of his finest performances as the wealthy iconoclast Sir Guy Grand - assisted by a deadpan Ringo Starr. Cameos aplenty, some more successful than others. McGrath handles the vaudevillian traffic to the best of his ability. Spike Milligan once summed up the cult movie's enduring appeal: ""You've really got to hate people to love this film."""
4,"Great Jig set, wish there was more size variety","These are good jigs, love the colors but wish they came with more variety of sizes. smaller ones would be awesome."
1,Pointless...,"Bored housewife, unappreciated by her husband etc. interviews two student prostitutes, gets intrigued and then turned-on by their seemingly more exciting, more liberated lifestyle. Lots and lots of questioning looks and smiling between the interviewer and interviewees and... that's about it. No real exploration of the realities of these girls' lives, or their clients, a couple of fairly graphic but unerotic scenes and huge amount of well worn cliches. All explored before in the equally insipid, superficial and cliched Belle de Jour. The issues it raises are interesting but, like Belle de Jour, it delivers no answers and the real question is what on earth is Juliette Binoche doing in such a boring and pointless film? A waste of her and your time."
2,Snore,"Could not get past the first 20 minutes. Not only was it uninteresting, but i was also not expecting subtitles. I watch foreign films quite often, but i have to be in the right mind set to read my movie and something has to keep my interest. Neither of these 2 factors were aligned on that day."
5,Spanish-English Dictionary,Great dictionary for a beginner learning Spanish. It helps a lot when using RosettaStone software lessons to figure out some of the words.
5,Excellent Dictionary,"Just beginning to learn Spanish and this dictionary is easy to use and light weight enough to carry in my purse. I am finding words with ease. I was also impressed with the bonus feature of a free electronic dictionary available for download. If you are interested in Spanish, this is a must have!"
5,Buy this one! Do not buy the Kindle edition!,"This is an excellent dictionary and it includes an ebook version that will work on most readers. It's much cheaper to buy this book than to buy the Kindle version from Amazon, and you get a Kindle version anyways. Great buy!"
2,So so,"I have been using the dictionary and I find that it is missing many words that I need. Many times I can find a word translated from English to Spanish but not from Spanish to English, which is what I bought the book for. I want a better Spanish English dictionary!"
3,Good dictionary,"This was required for my 3rd grader's Spanish class. It appears to be a great reference, as all of us in the house have been using it."
4,Hard for Young Kids,"While the box says it's for 3+ years of age, ha! It is tough to figure out how to maneuver the controls. I would not recommend this game for kids under 6 years old. The graphics are great and it's creative, but for older kids."
4,Ice age 2,"We have had great fun with ourselves and the grandchildren over 8 , 4and 6 a bit young yet."
5,One of a Kind!,"I found this book delightful and culturally significant, as it's the first children's book I've seen to weave its story around Cambodian culture. A wonderful message of hope and commitment, I plan to donate copies of this book to our local libraries. It's the sweet story of a girl from a poor rice farming family who steps out of her little world to become a court dancer at the Royal Palace in Cambodia. With rigorous training and the special opportunity to perform with her troupe in Paris, she ultimately sees herself transformed from a simple country girl to a graceful dancer through the drawings of the famous French artist Monsieur Rodin. The book's illustrations beautifully bring the book to life. Enjoy!"
4,Man vs Wild Season 1?,"When I purchased this product, I was under the impression that when it said ""Season 1"" it was the whole season. Nope. It contains only a few episodes of the First Season. By the time I found this out, my brother had already opened his gift and used it (so I did not return it). It plays and works fine (hence 4 stars), but it is not the whole season."
4,Nice elegant light with quiet fan,"One of our prettier light fixtures, and an asset to our new bathroom. Fan is quiet and seems to pull a lot of air.Only snag was that the fan didn't work as delivered! Tested it and found that the fan motor was open circuit - not fixable. Annoying since the whole assembly was already installed.However, called the number for Hunter in the enclosed documentation, and they sent out a new fan assembly without question or delay once I sent them the Amazon email as proof of purchase.Not too hard to replace and it looks and works great now."
3,flaws you can't see on line,"I gave it a 3 star for 2 reasons:the 2 part metal design over the glass is not a good fit, it is offset and outer piece does not properly line up with its matching piece.the fixture does not accept a regular bulb or an energy saver; must use a regrigerator bulb which is short and fits in the limited space provided.it is quiet though"
5,phenomenal and super for ideas and inspiration,"unlike other plain, boring books with a bunch of text and black & white print....this is a refreshing break :) I am so happy I stumbled upon this book (which comes with CD rom) because the way it is color categorized and organized and the selections of sites in the book are super spectacular. Looking at this book initially really inspired me to get into multimedia art and it is so motivational to see and admire other people's works. If you want a book with more visuals and less blah, blah, boredom then this is the book for you. I just ordered web design index 3 and im waiting on web design index 4 to come out on amazon :)"
4,Hysterical,"Every time I see Tom Hanks staircase crumble while he is on it, I just can't stop laughing. I have seen this film numerous times and every single time, it makes me laugh.A True Comedy"
5,Excellent Movie!,"This is a great film, as I've seen it numerous times and it keeps getting funnier every single time I see it. I'm a big Tom Hanks fan, but I would like to see him more films such as this one where he can showcase his comedic talents. I highly recommend this film!"
4,The Money Pit,"Has there ever been a bad Tom Hanks movie, but this is not just entertainment value watch this before you do major renovations I could have saved $250,000 had I watched this first. Even as an oldie its still good."
3,SCENES MISSING,"I love this movie, but in the DVD version there are some scenes that are missing. The entire sequence where they spend there first night in the house and actually break the step is totally left out! Also the scene with the trees falling is cut short. Those were the two I noticed but there may be more. Why do studios do this? It is a total letdown to fans."
5,The Money Pit,"I recommend this very funny movie to anyone who has ever done any home remodeling! It is one of our family's ""classics""!"
3,Carefree '80s comedy.,"The Money Pit starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long was a childhood favorite of mine, I used to watch this film all the time but watching it now, it is dated and not that funny. Tom Hanks can make any horrible film moderately good, his comic timing is impeccable, he is a genius. There are some funny moments but mostly this box office bomb is pretty lame now, just watch it if you are a die-hard Hanks fan."
5,Hilerius,"Thanks for getting this DVD to me, I have been searching for this product here in South Africa for the past 3 years going to various video retailers. So I finnaly got this classic video which is one of the most amazingly funny comedy's i have ever seen. So thumbs up cant wait to get my next video through amazon."
5,The good old days,"Ah the 80's. Back when John Candy was alive and Tom Hanks did a string of comedies before he became all 'serious'. This is a great movie about a couple who buys an old 'fixer-upper' for a house and get in way, way over their heads. Everything needs to be redone (wiring, plumbing, etc.) and everything constantly falls apart.Shelley Long is her usual cute self. I have to admit I've had a real soft spot for her ever since Cheers. So if you want an evening to remember your favorite decade, or a family night with the kids, 'The Money Pit' is right on the money."
4,Anyone who is home owner will enjoy the humor in this movie,"What a pleasure this movie was! If you are a home owner and have done any ""fixing up"" you will laugh uncontrollably. Some where in the movie you will see yourself at some point. Enjoy."
3,[Three and a half stars] Very good and funny Hanks / Long comedy,"The last really good Hanks comedy andsurprisingly where he met Spielberg(who was Exec. Prod'r!) Director RichBenjamin does better job here than withBurt and Clint in City Heat, though hisdirection wasn't the real problem withthat *** star (mostly) bore. Supportingcast here is outstanding!"
4,Class for home owners,This movie makes me laugh every time I think about buying a new house. Good comedy... highly recommend.
2,This film is a money pit,"This is a moderate movie co-produced by Steven Spielberg. I'm surprised the house hadn't been destroyed already if it was so weak. Some of the people brought in to do maintenance were charging excessively high prices. It really sucked when Walter (Tom Hanks) managed to knock over the scaffolding while the construction crew was trying to rebuild the house. Why was the couple pretending to be married when they weren't? In the end, Walter's dad buys a house in Brazil from the same con artist who sold to Walter."
5,One of the best comedies of all times,This movie makes me laugh so hard I almost cry every time I see it. It is certainly one of the most funny movies ever... A super young and pleasantly hunky Tom Hanks shines as always demonstrating his undeniable talent for light stories. The whole plot and the impossible situations this poor couple is subjected to when trying to repair their new acquired home in the outskirts are beyond anything. I truly recommend it.
4,Truly a hysterical movie,"Even if nothing else in this movie were good, the scene where the bathtub crashes through the floor and Tom Hanks' ensuing reaction of maniacal disbelieving laughter (he honestly must have hurt himself laughing like that) makes the entire movie worthwhile. Even though I haven't seen this movie in awhile, just thinking of that scene makes me laugh. As an added bonus, the rest of the movie is great too. I'd rate the scene with Shelley Long and the raccoon as a good runner-up for funniest scene. There are so many others though... one of my favorites was really an audio-only scene. The frazzled couple had turned the lights off after a somber discussion of marital fidelity and Tom Hanks roars at Shelley Long in the dark, ""You WHORE!"" His inflection is perfect and that line just always makes me laugh. Don't miss out on this priceless comedy if you haven't seen it yet."
2,"A few laughs, but dated and poorly written","This is not a good comedy, it is a bad one. Let's remember that this bombed when it came out. There is no story in this movie except a house falling apart, and that is the only gag as well, a lot of ridiculous scenes of parts of the house spontaneously falling apart. As implausible as this is, it's occasionally mildly funny, unlike any of the dialogue, which is just implausible and not funny. Tom Hanks is in his forced acting stage, and very plastic. And Shelly Long, uff, let's not even go there."
1,Poor,"The case was still wrapped in plastic, however there was no DVD inside the case. Don't know that I will order movies from here again."
2,Only slightly redeemable--,"I bought this dvd in order to round out an order for free shipping. I had high hopes. I ended up fast forwarding through much of the film. I realize this is supposed to be a comedy, but the state of the house was so atrocious that I kept thinking--why didn't they have someone check it out first? The redeeming parts (and the most funny, in my opinion) were the construction crew that fixed the house, the last scene in the film, and some of the other smaller parts."
2,The Money Pit,"I was pleased with how quickly the process was in getting the product. However, I was not impressed with the sound quality of the DVD."
5,It splits well,I bought this to split the 2 nuts holding my toilet down. It was a hard area to reach and this tool worked great.
5,Wombmates,"If you have ever lost a loved one, whether it be a sibling, parent, child, relative or friend, you need to read this book. Even though the title ""Wombmates"" suggests siblings, it is a story of life, death and acceptance so beautifully written that it has helped my mother in grieving the loss of her daughter, and my mother-in-law to overcome the loss of her husband. This wonderful sharing of the author's experiences allowed me to finally be able to grieve for the loss of my sister and move on. It is a very heartwarming and touching book that I was unable to put down until it was finished. Because of this and the affect it has had on me, I bought copies for each of my own siblings to help them through their grieving process also. A truly remarkable story, I can only say thank you to Jane Samuels for sharing her pain in order to help the rest of us overcome ours."
5,This is a Must-Read!,"Jane asked me to proofread this book, and I agreed to do it, as a friend.So I began, not knowing what to expect...but within the first couple of pages, I was hooked! This story, the true story of Jane's experience during her brother's final illness and death, and her journey through the wrenching experience of grief to healing, drew me in as few books have done. In addition, it is beautifully written; Jane has a way with the written word that makes her ideas and experiences come alive before your eyes.One of the best books I've ever read."
3,A lovely story hindered by tentative writing,"You will enjoy the story in this novel if you can ignore the writing. The author clearly lacked a good editor. The writing is sprinkled with poor grammar (this author needs to learn the difference between lie and lay). What drove me to distraction was the use of every tentative word in the thesaurus. It is so bad I found myself going back to count how many times the author used the word ""quite"" on a two page spread--13 times!The story is great. The characters are well developed and you will like them. MK is an excellent story teller. I recently heard that her next book will be published by Blue Feather and she will have a respected editor working with her. I'll buy the next book based on my respect for Blue Feather and MK's ability to tell a good story."
4,"Sometimes, Love Finds You... Not the Other Way Around...","Tall, raven-haired, blue-eyed Jessica Harrison, an attorney and junior partner at a local law firm, finds she needs help. She has a reputation for being difficult to work with, so petite, blonde-haired, green-eyed associate Robin Williams is assigned to assist her. (Are you starting the get the picture?) Both women believe they are straight and each has a difficult past to overcome - Jess was left abruptly by James and Robin's fiance died in a car wreck just after they had a terrible fight. Despite everything, the two can't deny their feelings and fall quickly into unrequited love. Neither is willing to admit her feelings until Robin unexpectedly kisses Jess. They keep their fledgling relationship quiet, but still have consquences to face.This is a very good book and I freely recommend it."
3,Undeniably long,It is worth the read but I would by it second hand if I were you. The author could have cut a good 150 pages. Nice to see a romance develop but this one was way over kill.
2,Not Impressive!,"The moral of this story was very good, but the acting was poor and noticeably fake. We have two younger brothers, and they were not very interested in this DVD."
3,average quality but she did research it,"As both a writer and a historian I am always pleased when it is clear that someone has done research. Unfortunately, while it is very obvious that Hand has done more than average layperson research into the Amazon legend, especially the Achilles & Penthesileia legend, she does not pull the story out well. For example, I could forgive the embellishments to the narrative, it is, afterall, a very short legend only truly expanded in Late Antiquity to anything than just the battle. But there are too many characters who get their own chapters in this book. Given the title I wanted the book to focus on Penthesileia and Damonides -- when it did, it was very well written and interesting to read. Instead we seem to spend time in several characters' heads and it gets distracting. Also in the first part of the book, Achilles et al take off for Amazon regions and the Amazons know they are there but nothing happens -- why was that even in there? Overall disappointed."
4,Great Read,"Long review short - this is a well-written book about the life of an incredibly interesting man. Whether or not you believe in seers, this book is a page-turner for its riveting story of a very ordinary yet extraordinary person."
5,Highly important read,"An important read for anyone who wishes to heighten themselves spiritually and acquire a better understanding of the laws of nature, simply so.Robert E. Milliken author of, Stupid In Montana As America"
5,Harmonizing at its best,"This is the orginial Four Freshman, I use to see them in person, a couple times a year.When they were in Minneapolis, in the late 50's.I still play their music, they are GREAT!!"
5,Satisfied Customer,"I took my '88 Honda Civic 4WD wagon to the local Honda dealer to have the fuel pump replaced. They said they couldn't find a pump. After it was there for about a month I lost patience, went online, found a pump on Amazon, ordered it, received it within a few days even without expedited shipping, took it to the dealer the day it arrived, had it installed, and have been driving the vehicle ever since. That was over a year ago. I recommended to the dealer that they start ordering replacement parts from Amazon since their supply line apparently couldn't supply what was needed. The Beck Arnley pump works well, was without a doubt cheaper than the dealer's pump (assuming they could have found one), and has a comparable warranty. Delivery after my order was prompt, shipping was free, the car runs great... What's not to like?"
2,not very exciting,"i don't know, i just don't care for his style. it's seems kind of like non-jazz almost classical jazz. his solos are uninteresting. if you're looking to get some good piano in trios, try thelonious monk."
4,mazo de la roche and the jalna series,I read all of her books as a child. I am suprised that they are less well read now. But what is more suprising is that i recollect seeing them in french and sold in french supermarkets about 15 years ago. Is this because of the quebec influence ?? They really could do with being turned in to a television series. Also there was meant to be a film called Jalna - does anyone know anything about that. Tim Armstrong
4,Whiteoaks of Jalna,"I just finished reading this Jalna book,reread I should say after having read it when I was a teenager. I enjoyed it as must this time . I think I have read all the Jalna books when young,now I am interested in the author & can find no information on her,Is there a biography anywhere about Mazo DeLa Roche? You can find a long long list of the Jalna books on alibra.com."
5,Business Law - Down to Earth,"This book was one of the best Business Law books I have ever read. The authors write the book that makes Business Law easy to understand. It is very well written and once you start reading it, it is hard to stop. I highly recommend this for any Business Law Course or if you want to skim the surface of the subject, then this book is the proper gradient."
5,Great Case!,"This 3/4 size cello bag is well-made and well-padded. My middle schooler can tuck her music in the side pockets and use the straps to wear it like a backpack. There enough little pockets for rock stops, the bow, music, rosin and any other necessities. This is a nice case!"
5,Comfortable shoes,Love these shoes. Not only are they comfortable but look good on your feet. Shipping was quick. I am very satisfied with this product.
2,mah...,While the shoes are indeed easy to walk on and they fit well with my wide feet. They do rub on the inner side of my arch and in a short walk will cause blisters on them. Can't wear them without socks which defeats the purpose of clogs....
3,"reasonably as advertised, but order at least 1/2 size larger",Shoes are not true to size: Save yourself the expense of returns and order at least 1/2 sz. larger than your normal sz.
4,"My bosses story,Shadows on the Wall","I stumbled on to this book while looking for Australian soldiers stories during the Vietnam era to our present confrontation in Afghanistan.I read the book and found it to be something that I found very interesting and informative about the man as Capt Stan Krasnoff.I enjoyed Shadows on the wall I found it very interesting to know we had people attached to aggressive units other than our RAR Battalions SAS and AATTV.I also find myself in a very lucky position as I was lucky enough to be in 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment under the command of Lt Col Stan Krasnoff. AKA (crazy horse KRASNOFF)this man did not expect anyone to do anything he wouldn't do, he would always be there at the start and at the finish of all tasks carrying his SLR.Yes SLR not an M16 rifle he led by example and I am proud to say that he was one of my Commanding Officers.To the person who wrote the review ""Shadows is Fantasy"" If you can't sign your own review than what can we say...."
3,"Not one of 'Bo Gritz' best, in fact written by a russian decent, Aussie, who severed under Bo...","Bo Gritz wrote the forward and it IS ABOUThis first tour in the Cambodia region ofSoutheast Asia. Written in vulgar (and non-Christian) style by an Aussie named Krasnoff,who served under Gritz for about one-and-a-half years. The previous reviewer, who issuch a coward, he won't reveal his name, thisstory IS MOST ASSUREDLY not fiction. By thewritting style is best suited for someone otherthan a fine Christian like Bo Gritz to be assoc-iated with. Bo's intro is very good though. Itadds to: 'A Nationa Betrayed', 'Called To Serve',and 'My Brother's Keeper'. Interesting if you canstand the language..."
4,I love this thing,"I've never been a Lazy Susan person, and I also don't like my trash out in the open. This is a fantastic idea, and the item does exactly what it looks like it does.The instructions on getting it together could be much better (for example, I don't remember the name of the piece, but you have to insert the set screws into the piece before you slide them onto the pole, and only the bottom one needs them as the top one is what rotates,) and the supplied pole didn't fit in my cabinet (an adjustable pole would be ideal) but I was able to fit the supplied hardware onto my existing lazy susan pole and after a little calibrating it works just fine.So, the 4 stars due to the instructions and the pole not fitting. If I hadn't had an existing lazy susan in there I would have been out of luck. Shipping and packaging was fine, came right on time. This really is a great product, I love it."
5,Pretty Cool!,"I ordered the rotary recycler in December, but because of previous reviews, hesitated to install it until yesterday. Yes, the instructions are pretty weak, and yes, you will most likely need a saw to shorten the main bar, but oh, I had it installed in less than 30 minutes! I wish I had done it sooner!If you already have a lazy susan in your corner cabinet, taking that out and installing the rotary recycler is pretty simple.The bins are quite large and easy to remove. Over all, I think I will be quite satisfied with this purchase"
3,Looks very realistic but payout way to high,"I enjoy playing the slots every now and then, so I picked this up on sale at a local store. It's very realistic, right down to how it spins, the bonus games, scatter, etc., however, it pays out too high. I was hoping for the payout percentages to be as realistic as how it looks. Believe it or not, I WANT to lose money. I want it to feel like I'm really at the casino. It's not so fun if you keep winning all the time, at least it isn't for me."
1,Not my wife's favorite casino disk!,"My wife owns all of the casino disks you can basically buy. She loves the slot machine games from Phantom EFX but according to her this game disk is dated in the style and types of the slots. When compared to the newer versions of the slot machine disk out now there is no comparison and in her words, ""This disk was boring."" Most of the new disks offer video graphic slots and cute bonus rounds with animation. This disk was released in 2004 and so it is almost 8 years old.She told me that she didn't even finish playing all the machines on this disk. She recommends that you look at the other slot machine disks from Phantom EFX."
1,You need the CD in the computer to play the game!,"I carefully read all of the reviews and bought this game. When I installed it, I played it for a while and it was okay - not wonderful. But when I tried to play it the next day, it wouln't work without the CD being inserted into the drive. This is not acceptable.If I knew it needed the CD, I would not have bought it.Also, although it said it was new, it looks like it wasn't - there were no papers in the box, just a tiny slip of paper telling you how to load it. Commercial games come with papers, even ads for other games."
3,Reel Deal Slots Nickels & Moore,"I previously had Reel Deal Nickel Slots by Phantom & really enjoyed it. The CD became damaged & I had to buy a new one. I was looking forward to an improved version, but this was somewhat dissappointing. I love the nickel slot games & most of these are ok, but nothing to get exited about. It seems that the technology should improve with time. I would love to see something that was closer to what you get in the casinos."
2,carb tool model w1187,good service good looking tool but it didn't work i think it was manely for car carberaters the socket was to thick to go into the carb on my weedeater brand blower i sent it back for a refund
1,"I sent it back,were'smy return money?","It was'nt the right tool.so i sent it back,has been about 4 weeks now still have'nt got my money returned to me yet.I have a routing mail # when i sent it.so if you want it email me."
4,A solid explanation for Africa's economic failure,"Sandbrook looks at the disappointments of independence, the reasons for the failure of capitalism, colonial roots of contemporary problems, class and tribal issues, the phenomenon of personal rule and neo-patrimonialism, and how citizens survive under disfunctional governments. The book is well written, easy to read, and offers some thoughts on why Africa didn't do better after independence."
2,Not the correct size,"This item for the price was great, but this particular one is not a size D cup as stated. It is much smaller, so keep that in mind if you order it."
5,My home town,"What a terrific novel . Being from the Buffalo area made the story more familiar and the places more enchanting. We local people all remember Love Canal & all recognize the allure of the falls and the enticement to be carried away by the hynotic spell it casts. By the end of the story, I cared about Dirk Burnaby's children and was hoping for their success. This is a great book club find. I recommend it highly!"
3,The falls,Long book but pretty good about the Love Canal (eventually).They want me to write at least 17 words to submit the review but I gave an accurate evaluation in the first few words of these comments
2,What Did I Read?,"Or better yet, I can't believe I read the whole thing! Great premise for a story, but the characters, especially Ariah, were just plain unlikeable, boring and unbelievable. The only character with any redeeming qualities was Dirk, and the author killed him off way to early in this overly long, confusing and downright boring book. Just when you think this book is going somewhere, the author takes the story into another direction. I finished this book because I kept thinking something great was waiting around the corner, sadly it fell flat at every turn.Save your money and your precious time with this snooze fest."
