1,quickly dulls,I have used only one of the bits so far and it dulled and became usless within 30 minutes of use on MDF. I expected more.
4,"Urgent, insurgent punk rock","Loads of energy, tight playing, and lyrical pathos all nicely balanced with brains a sense of humor. Lots of revved-up start/stop punk stuff that, like the last reviewer, reminded me more than a little of early SST stuff, even though I'm thinking more Minutemen than Black Flag(the Robbies don't go anywhere near metallic...) Even amid all the rhythmic chaos, power surges, rants, howls, and raves, the New Rob Robbies thankfully don't forget to bring the melodies, and their lyrical images (even the throwaway lines) are (whether they mean it or not) often insightful and linger in your head. ""Come and Go"", ""Leaving The Nest"" and ""Twas the Arrival Of The Cockroaches"" are bound to wind up on my year end ""best of"" tape..."
3,Additional Reading May Be Required,"OK, First thing's first, this is a tie in. It's a tie in to the Marvel's new Secret Wars story arc, and that's it's biggest problem.Bendis seems to get a lot of things right regarding Jessica in this that may have let down readers of Alias from the previous Pulse book, but, the trade off is that this story has the feel of those old star trek episodes that excluded the main characters with the intention of presenting a different perspective on the universe. You get the feeling things are going on without any idea what they relate to, but, by the end, the book never does clear this up.As an Alias mini-series tie in to Secret Wars, this might have been an acceptable book, but as it stands, it's a mess. That being said if you're a fan of Alias, you've probably already picked this up, but if you're only experiance with Jessica Jones is the previous Pulse TPB and you haven't read the new Secret Wars series, then this is probably not the book for you."
2,Hardly any plot here,"Following on from Pulse Vol 1, this vol 2 is a real let-down. As this is tied in with a Secret War Theme running in other Marvel titles, there is no further resolution of what this Secret War is about except that Nick Fury and SHIELD were responsible for Luke Cage to be injured by a mysterious woman. The whole volume centres on Jessica's on-going pregnancy and her hysterical search in trying to locate Luke Cage. The drawings are pretty ambiguous in showing locations and events. The whole point appears to be a muddled attempt to portray scenes of confusion."
3,could be improved,"I got some solid use out of this--enough to get me to buy replacement heads for it. But soon after I did the small plastic piece that holds the brush head on snapped off. So now I'm ordering another so I can use the replacement heads that I had stockpiled. (The bristles could be a bit stiffer on those heads, but this seems to be a problem with just about every dish brush I've ever had.) I did not have any problems with leaks by the way."
1,TOTAL COST FOR SOAP ???? +++++,This is the worst product from OXO & I must have over 70 products from oco this rates a 1. Soap leaks ALL THE TIMETotal waste & I LOVE OXO PRODUCTS! Oh Well No company or anyone is perfect!
2,OXO brush,Not as nice as the one with permanent head. Seller should consider new shipper. The package was left out in the road.
2,Leaks.,"The one I purchased leaks from the black stopper. Unless I leave it at a particular angle, I come back to detergent all over my counter."
5,Great brush!,"I've used is product for a long time now. I hadnt used it during the time others say it had a 'design flaw'. The brush dispenses the right amount of soap for quick cleaning, especially if you have a dishwasher that requires decent debris removal. Beware of the brush staying too moist, as it will mold like most things with trapped moisture."
2,"Doesn't last, rubber soap dispenser ""button"" doesn't work well","This brush will last 1-2 years at most. You can buy brush head refills which is great because they wear out quickly. The bad part about this brush is that after months of use and pushing the rubber soap dispensing button, the rubber will develop a split, then you can push until finger goes right through it, but it would dispense any soap. After having this same problem with two brushes, I've moved on to a different brand that dispense soap differently."
1,Omigod! It's an Oxo!!,"For several years I had what seemed like a great kitchen brush with a detergent reservoir. The only problem was that the brush leaked detergent, leaving a gooey mess on my sink. With time, this problem became worse, and so I resolved to get a new brush made by a reputable company like Oxo. I researched kitchen brushes on Amazon and found a couple of promising Oxo brushes. One even looked like the one I had. Then it occurred to me to check the brush I had to see who made it. It was difficult to distinguish the name, but I finally made it out: Oxo!Avoid this brush like the plague. It looks great but is poorly designed and manufactured. While in principle the detergent reservoir is a good idea, in practice it just creates annoying messes and wastes detergent. There is another Oxo brush that appears to be much better but is also more expensive. This brush, however, is just a waste of money."
4,It's fine.,"When I bought this item, I thought it was one of those brushes where the soap comes out when you used it no matter what. (I probably should have read the product description better!) Then when I got it, I found out that to make the soap come out, you press this little black button, and soap squirts out. I think this, and I don't like this.I like this because when you use the other type of brush, you always have to be using the soap. You can't just try to wipe something off before you put it in the dishwasher, or use the brush while you are rinsing off the soap.However, the amount of soap that comes out each time is not always the same. Sometimes it's the amount I would use to wash 4 pots. Other times, I have to press the button a few times to get the amount I need to wash one item. Thankfully, I have figured out that the amount of soap dispensed is dependent on the amount of soap in the brush. Now I just need to figure out how to change the amount I dispense."
1,Failed after 3-months,the thumb soap dispenser cracked and split after three months of use. This one replaced the same unit from 5 years ago that was configured a bit different so that soap was filled at the dispense point so the plastic piece was thicker and more robust so it could stand up better to normal use. Very disappointed.
2,Good while it lasts,"I have purchased this product twice and each time the plastic connection piece that accommodates the brush head has broken. Poor design and execution. I thought at first that I was too rough with it when changing heads... but despite my careful handling the second time around, the cheap thing broke. I will not be buying this again and I recommend you find an alternative too."
3,It's OK,"This product is just OK. I like that it is comfortable to grip, and the brush is good. I don't like that the soap dispenser always stops working! I've had two of these, and on both of them the soap dispenser just doesn't work after a while."
1,broke during 4th week of use,"I thought this brush would be great...my last one from OXO lasted a few years. But this time I used it the way I normally use dishwashing brushes (not too vigorously), and the rubber button you press with your thumb to dispense the soap pushed completely through and is now permanently broken and useless. Complete waste of the money I spent on this brush, and on the 2 brush refills that I bought separately."
4,Easy to use,"Easy to use and to fill/refill with soap, my only complaint is that I wish the bristles were a bit shorter to make it easier to use, but it works great and I will continue to use as an easy way to dispense soap as/while I'm cleaning pots and pans in the sink."
3,Unnecessary Flaw,"Sad that this brush works so well for a short time until the rubber soap pusher splits. It happened again soon after we got a replacement with admonition to avoid pressing it with fingernail touching. So a sign went up ""use flat finger""...no difference! For months now we tilt the brush to leak a dollop of soap from the slit, then reverse it to brush the offending article. Then to store the brush it has to be propped up both sides by other sink items, or it will fall over and spill its oily contents--and have ever tried to mop up dishwasher soap?! My wife finally bought a plastic item for a few cents from Stop n Shop and it works beautifully, but I'm a sucker for design even when if doesn't function (forgive me F.L.Wright). Gus Vasiliadis, NJ"
3,Not universal in use - but has some pluses,overall it works great to get into the nooks of all sorts of cookware. The fact that it has different detachable brush/sponge options is a big plus. the built-in soap dispenser on the other hand could have used some better testing. I pump and pump and pump and pump and still no soap. I give up.. I just squirt some soap on the bristles.
2,Leaks Constantly!,"If you're reading all the reviews for this item then clearly you already know that it leaks. It's just such a mess that I had to add another 'leaky' review myself!The good news, and why it got 2 stars from me instead of 1, is that the brush is actually quite nice. It doesn't scratch my non-stick pots but it does do the cleaning job well. With that said however, the amount of soap that I've had to clean off the counter is ridiculous! There is no angle that makes it stop. Face up and the loading seal leaks; face down and the brush's dispenser leaks. NO WIN!!!There is nothing more irritating that having to clean the counter before I clean the cookware! ..and let's not even talk about the waste of soap! The aggravation FAR outweighs the benefits!"
3,I am not sure if ours is OXO but,"I bought a dish brush that looks almost identical to the OXO, but I am not absolutely sure if it is. The problem with mine is the same as what other reviewers are saying. The seal doesn't stay shut,and I have only had it for 3 months. Also on mine the soap dispenser never really worked quiet right. We have had to hold the brush at a certain angle to get a little soap to dispense. Now , the other day it fell apart, and my fiance said it came unglued, I would think this is how other dish brushes are made, but maybe not. The up side of my brush is that the brush part of it is excellent. I haven't had any problems with it. It is sturdy enough to do pots and pans, but gentle enough to do glasses and dishes without scratching."
1,Very disappointing quality,"I've used Oxo's older version and this new version. I bought this because I hoped the twist-off cap feature would solve the leaking problem in the old design, where the squirter button was also the fill cap. This new design is even worse. It took much more pressure to squirt soap solution. As a result, the squirter button tore after a few weeks.I like the idea of a soap dispensing scrubber. The Dawn offeringDawn Fillable Kitchen Brush (Pack of 2)is cheaper and better designed. By including an internal lever that opens a dispensing valve, very little pressure releases soap. This makes it a sturdier, longer-lasting product."
1,won't last,Bought this brush 3 weeks ago and the rubber push button seal cracked open and now soap won't come out.I bought many OXO products and most of them failed within 1-2 months but this one after only 3 weeks! I'm done with OXO. Why would you make a product with replaceable brush when the actual handle do not last. It is a beautiful product but really cheaply made. They should test their product a little longer!
2,Works great until...,I really like the way these things work until the rubber gives out around the push button. I've had both versions of these (the old ones you use to fill through the button and the newer ones you fill in the handle) and both have failed to the point where they are ineffective as a self soaping brush. I average around 4-6 months of use out of them before I have to buy a new set. I really wish they would fix them so they are more durable.
5,Powerhouse 70's style NY Salsa for 2002,"What a great CD! When i read the previews on the album, the line-up of artists alone sent shivers up my spine. This is a cool all-around album. Mostly salsa dura, with a cha-cha and bolero thrown in. You can hear many different styles of salsa incorporated into this modern repetoire. If you have [X], buy it."
5,El Poder de la Salsa,Wonderful CD for those of us who DJ get it own it. Infectious grooves and sexy rhythms only enhance the experiance. I recommend it for those people who want to hear Salsa as it should be played. True soneros who use of voice add to the beat. For those people experiancing salsa for the first time do not confuse Marc Anthony for a salsero. .....
3,Solid but not great,"This album claims to be the ""answer to the Buena Vista Social club"" from Spanish Harlem but it falls short of BVSC type status on many levels. It's mostly an album of covers. Typically, one or two covers are performed on a CD of this type but I counted at least three or four covers. There's something to be said about originality of composition and arrangement. Now, this is not to say that the band doesn't hit high notes (no pun intended) on certain tracks. Their rendition of La Banda is great. However, most of the album is just flat. If this CD is to answer BVSC and capture the essence of NY Salsa, then I would have liked to hear more percussion descarga as well. There were virtually none to be found. This album does not stand against albums by other artists like Jimmy Bosch (Soneando Trombon) and Ray Barretto (Indestructible). All in all, could have been much better."
2,Basic and unmoving. Unoriginal.,"With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of ""filler"" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once."
3,The true Nuyorican experience,"The 12-piece all-star band gives us a glimpse inside the secret history of the Nuyorican experience, turning out fiery dance music, rhythmic passion, and latino soul. The only salsa album you'll ever need."
4,They've Meant Nice,"There hasn't been a whole lot going on with country music recently. Nevertheless, with what has been going on with The Dixie Chicks within the past few years was just difficult. From the fallout of their President Bush bashing, to many people not being interested in their music with a public steamrolling of their music, Natalie Maines and company went through a difficult passage of time. Nevertheless, their latest single Not Ready To Make Nice from the #1 album Taking The Long Way Home, is a delightful song that shows their impressions of what happened to them from the past. The song is one of the best songs out there on the radio right now, and it is just delightful. Their feeling for the song sounds better than most of the tracks from the beginning of the groups' longtime career. I really like this song a whole lot.Song: B+"
2,nothing,It did nothing for me..But i will get it some more time.I have not been able to find anything that works well.
5,Smells and works great,I use this with a few other things and it works wonders. I love the smell and the ease of use. Rolls right on! Seems to last quite a long time. I will begetting more when needed.
3,Warm Relief,"It does help for a while before it wears off. It warms the problem area, but does not irritate the skin."
3,Works Great but had to modify manufacturing oversite,"Works great. Motion sensor detects people when a room is entered and it automatically calls my cell phone number. However, one problem: I had to drill a hole in the plastic case for the telephone cord to run through...apparently the quality inspection department did not catch this oversite."
1,Arrived DOA,ZERO rating!!! I had to give it ONE star rating in order to post this review. It didn't work after opening the package and following the instructions. I sent it back and the seller refunded my money. Obviously not the sellers fault but quality control at the manufacturing end must be really poor. A nice idea but cheaply done.
5,Will,Perfect little alarm system. Lets me know when my kids arrive home. Loud and a very easy set up. I will be making a second purchase for a friend. In an earlier review someone said you have to drill for the phone cable. You do not have to drill phone cable runs behind it through a small slots provided.
2,"Good idea, not not deliver.","It does not deliver consistently. What they really should do is to make it cellular, using sim card. I would image much better results."
2,Crap!,Bought this for home use and it never worked. The siren would work when movement detected but it would not make a call no matter what I did! Save your money and buy something different!
2,works,Works but does not meet my expectations.The 10 second delay is way to long for my place.I live in a small place and bye the time they kick the door in they might have enough time to take the alarm off the wall.
3,Works great but does not like 0's in phone numbers.,Easy to set up. Works fine so far. It dials one of our cell phones but when programming the second phone it makes a funny beep whenever a 0 is inputted. Does not call second phone.
2,"This is an abridged version, not the real deal!","I bought this book a couple of years ago. It wasn't until recently, when I was leafing through a very old copy that I found on my shelves that I realized that this book does not contain the following stories that were in the original: How the First Letter was Written; How the Alphabet was Made; The Crab that Played with the Sea; and the Butterfly that Stamped.In particular, the Crab and the Butterfly are two of the finest Just so Stories and should not be missed. I certainly would not have bought this book had I known it was an abridged version. I suppose that's why the publishers have cleverly entitled this book a ""collection"". What's an added disappointment is that there is no indication or explanation anywhere in this book regarding the excluded stories--though I can guess at the reasons.If I were buying, I'd look for a complete edition."
1,Not what I expected,"I had the impression the stories would be good to read to a child, they weren't."
4,"Cleans nicely, but no sprayer","The Citrabright All-Purpose Spa cleaner cleans ""ring-around-the-hot-tub"" off the surface with very little elbow grease. But it doesn't have a sprayer as pictured. Instead, it just has a typical flip-top - at least the bottle I got was that way. Of course, I have plenty of sprayers around the house, so that is no problem. But be forewarned that you might not get a sprayer with it if that is what you are hoping for."
2,Don't Bother,"Don't bother to buy this book if you own the Divine Hours series. There is nothing new here. All this is is a reprinting of the Lenten and Easter readings right out of the other book.If you haven't used the Divine Hours series, you might consider buying this one, but if you like the series and buy all three volumes, why buy this?Save your money and buy the series."
2,Didn't work to my expectation,This product easily removes excess touch up paint but I was not able to make the surface completly smooth and blended in. It could be just me but I'm sure most people buying this don't know how to wet sand either. I'm just a regular joe. I would only use this to remove big blobs and then just start over with a touch up paint pen.
3,sue price is very nice,"I orginally owned this movie on VHS which is why I decided to buy it on DVD. Unfortunately, this is the 4th installment and the only one available on DVD. The only name brand actor in the movie is Andrew Diveoff. Sue Price at the time was a body builder and looks great, but not so for the acting. Special effects are cheap. So then why buy the movie... just to see Sue Price topless ..yep, you better believe it..she has a great body and displays it quite often. If you like cheap sci-fi with some body building nudity, then this is one to add to your collection."
3,just for nemesis fans,"This is the last act of the nemesis story and it should be the last. The story is just boring referring to part 2 and 3. Of course the ultimate star Sue Price does her work, some nude scenes for her fans are concluded, but the hole story, effects and handling have not the same quality like the other three parts."
3,Through the wall exhaust fan,"The fan works as promised, the only problem I encounter is that the knob that turns the fan on and off is a little short after installation.It is noisy, but it's not meant to be running all the time."
4,Broan 509S Ventilator,With the addition of a $10 variable dimmer switch (purchased separately) this ventilator works well.
4,it really sucks... no it really pushes air.,"This fan works great, the on/off knob is very short, so your install location will have to make this work. I had to wire in a switch to make it work. It really moves air, but man is it loud."
5,very powerful,"we have this venting a 30 sqft bathroom through a 12 foot flexhose to the outside wall, with a Famco Louvre vent cap instead of the big metal cap included. It works very well and blows full speed against the resistance of such a long path. quality made in usa."
3,"Good Unit, but rather noisy",The Unit is all that it is noted to be. It works well but I believe it could be better designed to operate at a lower noise level and still move 180 cubic feet per minute.
3,Not a bad book but bad spelling and punctuation,First thing that I have to say about this books is this author needs to FIRE her editor!!! I have never seen a book with this bad of spelling and punctuation ever!! It's annoying for me because it's like no one ever edited this book. If you can get past the bad spelling and punctuation and the fact that the author repeats herself a lot it's a good book. I wouldn't spend $3 on it though.
4,Fast Paced,From the moment I opened this book to the time i closed it all I can say is - Fast Paced. Alot of times while reading romantic suspense novels they either have no supsense or no real romance. Well this book has both. I really enjoyed it.Addison is looking for her birth mother after the death of her adoptive parents tragic death. She decides to hire a P.I. and in turn meets Randall a complicated man helping his brother at the P.I. office till his manadory leave is up. These two characters together have good chemistry and lots of drama. Her character development was done fairly well and the romance was pretty convincing. Solid four stars for me.
1,unrealistic romance,"I absolutely love the Kate Burkeholder series and eagerly ordered this book....ugh, it is on kindle and I cannot even donate it to the library or anywhere. I got thru 3 chapters and I liked the premise...but the romance is unrealistic...The heroine is in a dangerous situation and attracted to a guy who is a threat..ok..that can happen.....but the way these 2 characters behave at that initial meeting is just dumb. Who would check out the body of someone who is posing a physical danger to you while engaging in lengthy lustful thoughts? Hello?! fight or flight not a time out for sexual fantasies!.....could not get past the first couple of chapters and that is a shame because I am sure that Castillo as usual has a lot of insightful things to say....maybe I will give it another chance someday..after skipping those first chapters....I am SO disappointed at one of my favorite authors....."
2,More Romance than Mystery,I thoroughly enjoyed all of the Kate Burkholder series so I expected to enjoy this book as well. Characters were one dimensional and not very appealing. The mystery was uninteresting and predictable. I'll wait for another Kate Burkholder before reading Castillo again.
1,"Cheesy, implausible romance novel.","I'm a huge fan of Castillo's ""silence"" series. Love them, couldn't put them down. This one is ridiculous. Embarrassingly bad romance novel!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I always enjoy reading Linda's books, however, this one just didn't do it for me - too sappy and predictable."
2,Poor kindle quality but good book,"I love to read on my iPhone at night and I use the black background with white letters for less glow at night. Unfortunately, most of the pages on this book do not convert that way. At first I thought it was my phone but this is the only book that this happens too. So disappointed. However I love this authors writing style and this book is good as far as I have read into it."
3,Very poorly proofread,"I have purchased several of Ms Castillo's books from Amazon's ebook selections and while the stories are pretty good the proofreading is horrendous! Many times you think 'WHAT?' and have to go back and reread a page to see if you missed something - no, just no editing! The first 50 or so pages will get your attention but then the proofreader went to sleep or just skipped over to the last 50 pages! For instance, 'ten thou sanddollars' should have been 'ten thousand dollars'. You lose the story line completely! There is of course bound to be some errors in just about any book, but these are ridiculous! I won't be buyung anymore of Ms Castillo's books. But if you don't mind the errors the stories are OK."
1,Heroine is beyond belief stupid,"I normally do not write reviews as I generally am in agreement with the reviews provided by other people. However, in this instance I feel as though I must have read a different book from everyone else.I normally like Linda Castillo's books; however, I found the heroine acted stupid beyond belief. Everything was an argument with her and she just didn't get it that she and others around her were in danger even as people were dropping like flies.I found myself skimming over annoying passages just to finish the book. I wished that I was the villian and could have shot the heroine myself--that would have made the last 1/2 of the book much better."
2,"Good story, cheesy writing","The love story in this book was absolutely burdened with cliche. The plot line was compelling enough to keep me coming back, but I found the end fairly thin and unsatisfying too. Meh."
3,Javanese court gamelan,"I find this quite a ""difficult"" CD to listen to, not so good as the similar ""Music of the kraton"". However, it still has some very nice soft instrumental music with good examples of male singing.To me though, its similar to other gamelan CD's of court music - but still a valuable example."
3,This is not original,"I much prefer the music of Macolm McClaren's album, ""Fan."" The opera is better, and most importantly, McClaren's piece was the original 'inventor' of mixing opera with modern music. I could not believe that this album included many of the same arias that were included in the ""Fans"" album!"
5,good workout,I used these when cleaning/sweeping etc and the provide a decent extra workout. I recommend them for this purpose and they were surprisingly comfortable.
4,Good ABE Intro Book,"This book is geared specifically toward the beginner ABE (Adult Basic Education) learner. While it might be usable for ESL on some level, it is NOT specific to that purpose - regardless of the previous reviewer's comments involving learning English.If you are an adult trying to learn to read, or are assisting an adult who is fluent in English but is functionally illiterate, then this series is an excellent resource."
5,Excellent quality and sound,Best chimes you can buy. The sounds cannot be matched. Purchased this as gift and my mother loves it. Item arrived quickly and well packed. Success!
3,mr flibble is very cross,"main reason to acquire this set was for the episode ""quarantine"" with the mr flibble hand puppet: ""we can't do that mr flibble; who'll clean up the mess?"""
4,More Dwarfing,Honestly - if you enjoy one episode of Red Dwarf you must watch them all.I watched Seasons 1 - 2 on various channels when I would see them - but mostly never got a chance to see Seasons 3-8 until I bought them on amazon.I would have to say that the best Red Dwarf is found from Seasons 2-6 hand down. Season 1 is raw and good - Seasons 7-8 have totally diff production styles and other concerns from fans - but some prefer the last two Seasons. /shrug.Either way - these 2 DVDs hold up with great additional features including some discussion on the US Pilot creation and then the re-shoot of the US pilot. The US Pilots are not included (unless in some secret Easter Egg) but they showed some scenes from the original US pilot but not the reshoot in the bonus material. When BBC makes DVDs of the shows they don't slack on bonus material good for them.After the wrap up of Season 6 there was a 3 year production gap before Season 7 started back up.
5,Thanks to all!,"As the author of Bill Kroen's Golf Tip A Day Calendar, would like to thank Amazon subscribers for making the calendar a top best seller every year. Thanks also for the kind letters and thank you's for learning through my golf tips. Best wishes.Bill"
4,EMT Gel,I haven't had to use it yet. I keep it in my first aid kit incase myself or the dog gets hurt.
5,Overcoming Thyroid Disorders,This book gives the latest information for the persons who want to prevent or improve their own thyroid conditions without drugs.
4,Very informative,"Interesting book, but I was hoping for more info on hyperthyroidism. But still enjoyed all the information that was in the book."
4,book review,"This is a very informative book. If you have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and are still suffering from symptoms even though you are taking the prescribed medication, this book can help."
4,Brownstein's Book on Thyroid Disorders,"Dr. Brownstein, an M.D., is considered by many in the field of holistic medicine to be an authority on these disorders, and he is committed to helping people recover when they are stuck suffering from the symptoms, yet the tests of their thyroid levels meet the allopathic measures for a generalized range of ""normal.""He lays out a natural plan for encouraging thyroid production naturally. I follow it as I can, and will incorporate more components of it as it becomes feasible.The nutrition dovetails well with the Abs Diet plan, which I'm following, leaving out certain foods like cabbage and limiting others because of his list of foods that interfere with thyroid production.Also, his citations to relevant medical studies and the literature from past publications help me further my own research into it and try to sort out what I need to know to partner more effectively with my health provider."
5,A MUST for Thyroid Patients!,"As a practicing physician and someone new to the ""alternative"" world of medicine, Dr. Brownstein's book was indeed helpful. My wife has Hashimoto's and the detail and references in this book have helped me to guide her therapy. Easy to read but detailed, this book supplements Richard Shames' ""Thyroid Power: 10 Steps to Total Health"" as an excellent addition to any thyroid patient's reference library!"
5,Good Digestive Enzymes,I sprinkle this on my dog's food and her digestion is much improved. She use to throw up a lot and have itching issues and these have gone away. Ordering and shipment were prompt and I will continue to get this product.
4,It is what it is.,"If your are looking for a carrier for in cabin travel on the plane then this is it. The measurements are perfect for airline travel. Construction: This item construction wise is very ok, thin plastic, easy to clean.Sturdy handle. This item is not designed for daily carry its made to bring on a plain so it's not the best for other purposes. If you are looking for a carrier for birds,small puppies or small cats this item will work for you. Function, The clips slide easy but when slid to close position there is a piece that you need to push down to slide. The carrier is what it is, It's a perfect size for airline travel, its nice enough that it will last if taken care of. And yes the metal caging at the top does slide open so its perfect to calm or feed your pet. I bought this for a Sun Conure parrot and it is the perfect size."
4,The Eagle and The Iron Cross,"Although fiction, it is based on factual history. Extremely interesting that German prisoners were kept in the United States during World War II. Gave an interesting history of a camp in Arizona. The prisoners were lightly guarded as they had no where to go in the desert. An interesting history of Native Americans also."
3,good,"hard to install after 15 years, get the right tool to install with, what can you say , it's a fuel filter"
5,Spanish Book,"This product came on time and has been very helpful in the study of Spanish. This book is used for those who need a ""refresher"" in the language or those who have never been exposed to it."
5,Teach yourself Spanish,I needed a way to brush up on my Spanish since I started learning Spanish in the 3rd grade. I just wanted to keep up with the language. I was always better in Spanish than English in High School. Product arrived in excellent condition.
3,Teach Yourself Spanish Complete Course (book + CD pack),"The CD's begin by asserting that the course can be used at home, in the office or car. Yet the recording constantly refers the student to follow in the text. Try it while driving, a challenge if not frustrating, to say the least. And without the text to read & follow (while driving), one is quickly lost & confused. That precious time while driving is critical to me because I am just too busy otherwise. So, I hit STOP/REJECT & listen to the news (in English). Further, the CD constantly refers the listener to ""Practice by going over this again"". And then the CD does not go over it again, but merely continues with Spanish conversation unintelligible & too fast for the beginnerMy son gave me for Christmas ""Eyewitness Travel 15-Minute Latin-American Spanish, a complete course with book and two 60-Minute CD's"". By comparison, this course is much, much better, more elementary in the beginning & more methodical."
2,Shoulda bought another,"I've had Spanish in high school 20 years ago so some stuff is familiar. I was hopintg to learn how to conjugate verbs, numbers, and simple stuff. But this starts out as if you know the language and have p;roblems speaking it. I'd have rather purchased Spanish for Dummies."
5,This is an impressive program.,"I have reviewed many learn Spanish C/D's, tapes, books, etc.I think this is probably one of the best programs out there.It is designed for people traveling in Spain and uses Castillan Spanish."
3,Fairly Solid Book and CD but Need Behind the Wheel Spanish,"I would only conditionally recommend 'Teach Yourself Spanish' as a supplement to what I consider to be the very best Spanish course on the market; Behind the Wheel Spanish.One CD is not enough to teach you Spanish. Also, you need the American version of English to make you more comfortable.Behind the Wheel Spanish offers all of this and more. 8 CDs, native Latin American Spanish speaker, American instructor, lots of repetition.Still, I must say that 'Teach Yourself Spanish' is definitely worth the money as a 'back up' to Behind the Wheel Spanish."
2,Not really impressed I ordered Rosetta Stone...,"This system is okay but reminds me of high school language class, a little dry. You can use the program if you have time and are really patient.Average learning system."
1,Student learning Spanish,I thought that tapes did not help at all. The engish is english . I like the book but the tapes are a waste of my money. They don't repeat enough the phases in spanish.
4,RealReader,Prisoner of Passion (Harlequin Presents)I enjoyed the book. I'm knocking off a point for needless angst and harshness at certain points from the hero. The first portion of the book was great--the latter portion mixed with great and not so good. All in all I thought it humerous...so I agree with those who found it funny at times. I'd read this book again.
3,"Basic, introductory information","This is a helpful reference for people who aren't familiar with magazine publishing and gives some useful advice on how to deal with common problems. However, the writing is sometimes convoluted and redundant and the authors' perspective can be narrow. I would expect better writing from people who choose to write for a publishing industry audience."
2,Not as good as usual,"I have a lot of Playboy DVD's and this is my least favorite. The trouble with it is that nearly all of the film is cut from other Playboy films. In addition, some of the cutting wasn't done so well, as sometimes the clips only lasted a second or two. With all of the other much better Playboy videos out there, I don't see any reason why you should get this one."
2,Not one of Playboy's best,"I wasn't convinced that all the models were natural. A lot of them seemed unreal. Playboy has had much better videos. I bought the tape because it listed Kelly Monaco on the back, yet I'm not convinced I saw more than a fleeting shot of her. END"
2,Vignettes gallore,"Hosted by three natural girls, this video was quite boring. Rather than video pictorials of natural women, it is vignette's of about a dozen natural women, from big to quite small. There are three pictorials out of about 15 segments though. Each pictorial is of one of the three hosts for this video. There is not much to say that Amazon will allow me to say, other than with all of these vignettes as soon as you see something you like, you see it for a whole second or two, then it fades to another clip."
2,Too Tame Even For PLAYBOY,"This tape is way too tame, even for PlayBoy. The only reason I gave it 2 Stars is because the women are beautiful but unfortunately not sexy. If you enjoy PG-13 movies then buy it. If you enjoy R-rated movies then don't even think about buying it."
4,Good but not the best I have read.,I did like this book. I liked the part where Zara told Jamal she was pregnant. I also like the part where they told his mother that Zara was pregnant.
2,Not good copy,"I was very exceited about getting the book until I opened the package and got a look at what I ordered, then I was disappointed and upset because I felt like I was mislead about the quality of the book. The seller stated that the copy was in like new condition, may have been read with slight cracking on the spine. In reality it had a very heavily cracked spine and on top of that there was a large rip on the back cover, then there was also an oder of cigerette smoke. I was so unhappy with the book that after thinking about it for 24 hours I decided to return it and get a new copy of that book from a different seller and I also returned the book. All in all the service was great the item arrived in a timely manner and when I had it returned, which was done through a pick-up by UPS it was also timely. Just the quality of the book sold was not what you would expect with a like new sale."
1,Just plain wrong,"Sex, sex, and more sex. How two people fall in love without ever having a conversation is beyond me. The sex scenes were very steamy but that was about all that ever occured between Jamal and Zara. A little more dialogue would have been nice."
3,Almost 4 stars,"This was a very predictable piece of erotic fluff. But really,who reads romance for the action? The love scenes were very very steamy and well written. The only fault I found was how I knew what was going to happen next. It is a plot that's been used many times before, but one I enjoy reading.If not for the forseeable story line, this would be one of my favorites. I will definitely try Connie Mason again."
1,"Oh, please!","The only reason I read this was because I was deathly bored and there was nothing else available. One of the many reasons I no longer read romance--how many times can the harem storyline be used! I don't expect much from romance, but women who read and like this should wonder why they get little to no respect. This book is housewife porn, plain and simple."
2,Half & Half,The washing part of this machine is excellent. The dryer part keeps breaking down. Lint gets caught in the dryer fan and the fan cannot blow hot air into the tub. Mine is broke now for the 4th time.
5,Great help,This is a great help for my grandchild with words and spelling. This had made him want to do his work.
2,Just OK,This book feels like a textbook and is not exactly fun to read. I was looking for something interesting and to be used as a reference. It's just ok.
5,AWESOME!,This book is GREAT for anyone who has a difficult time teaching phonics. It is very easy to understand and gives the teacher in depth knowledge of phonemic elements.I highly recommend this book!!!
5,Can't wait to use this,"The book is wonderful and just what I was looking for. The delivery was swift, and the book was packaged in a way that it arrived in perfect condition."
4,very insightful,"A chilling insight into where our education system was moving even back in the 60s - it is concerning that all this information has been available, and still we seem unaware that education has been highjacked."
3,Do you remember Hansoul?,"Hansoul was a rising star in the early 90's (""Imagination"") before he just fell straight off the radar. Well he's back in the new millenium with a crew, new faith, but with a style stuck in the mid-90's.This album would be considered underground due to the lack of clarity in some of the music (budget). The delivery is somewhat hit-or-miss and at times Hansoul is obviously freestyling his way through a song (i.e., loses direction and/or focus). But his message concerning his faith in Jesus Christ is heard and felt. The collaborations with other artists don't strengthen the CD but detracts from it.Overall, it's an okay CD but I was honestly upset at having to pay $$$ for it."
1,False Claim of Gluten Free,"The manufacturer of this product claims that it is gluten free. There are two gluten bearing grains listed in the ingredients, Kamut - which is an ancient wheat variety and definitely always contains gluten, and Barley which is well known to contain gluten.If you have celiac disease avoid this product. If you are a cow the chlorophyl in this product is great for your four stomach digestive system."
4,FRITZ REVIEW,"THIS IS WHAT I HAD EXPECTED IN THE PRODUCT I HAD BOUGHT IS WAS PERFECT FOR WHAT I AM USING IT FOR AND EASY TO INSTALL, ALSO I GOT IT WHEN I WAS SUPPOST TO THANKS FOR THE SHIPMENT."
3,"Question, what is the difference between the 130 and the 130r?",Just want to know if anyone knows what the difference is between the 130 and the 130r? One is $1300 and the other is $900. Need some help.
1,Great printer from an awful company,"I've had this printer for two years and it prints marvelous prints. The problem I have is with HP: they decided to stop making paper for this printer and, instead, told me to go with 3rd parties. A company that doesn't stand behind their products is one that will not get future business from me."
1,Worst Printer ever designed,"This printer is absolute crap. Trying to feed a large poster size piece of paper into is, well, forget it. Crap! It is good for an 8 1/2 x 11 test page only."
3,HP Designjet 130R Engineering Drawings,"HP 130R was purchased to print CAD Drawings on Vellum drawing paper. It did not print true black, lines appeared grey and not black. I spent 2hrs with HP tech support online only to be told it does not support Vellum paper which is standard engineering drawing paper. I was also told it does not print true black, even though there is a print option for black and white in the driver. Other reviews indicate color fades over time. Bottom line is you want a printer to produce high quality engineering drawings this is not the machine you want to buy. I had extensive conversations with HP prior to purchasing this printer and as assured it would work. I have now returned the printer and looking to purchase a Cannon IPF750"
1,Great when it works right which is not very often,I bought this printer but constantly have to power it up and down and reset it to get it to work. It will print half a job then quit with no indication of what is wrong. The LCD display and buttons make no sense. Shame on Hewlett Packard....
1,Useless with Windows 7,"It is quite unbelievable- HP still makes and sells these printers, which are quite nice, but does not NOT support Windows 7. While there is a driver available, their Designjet System Maintenance Utility, which is absolutely necessary for quality printing, does not work under Windows 7 (does not recognize the printer.) Attmepst to resolve this issue did not elicit any response from HP support.As a result, I have a barely used printer, for which I originally paid $1,400 and just spent additional $260 on print cartridges, that I might as well toss in a dumpster.This was my last HP printer."
1,BEEP!!! BEEP!!! BEEP!!! BEEP!!! BEEP!!!,"If u r looking for a $1200 machine that beeps everytime then this is for u!!!I have yet to successfully print ANYTHING on this printer.All it does is spit the paper out no matter where i load it from.And when this happens a loud BEEP comes from it. Every time!!!I hate it i hate it, i hate it.Dont let the 24"" wide fool you. This only happens if u buy the ""extra"" roll feeder.If u dont have it u can only print 13"" wide. If it does print."
1,PIECE OF CRAP!!!!! DON'T BUY IT,"Well like may Graphic Artist I wanted to produce layout s in largeformat. I have always heard how good HP was and how easy it was to use so I figured that me next printer should be the king of printers.I can't tell you how upsetting this piece of crap is.It is so picky that you need to load the paper just the right way for it to grip it and if you don't it will keep kicking it back out to you over and over again. I must have done this 8 times before I just wanted to beat the living hell out of it. Oh but it gets better, this thing is so stupid that it does NOT calibrate the colors on its own. It takes you to a website and you have to have HP do it for you. It still didn't print sharp. And get this I try to call their customer service for support and they charge .69 min. Where do these jerks selling crappy printers get off charging for customer service????My god save your money and just print your stuff at Kinko's or a small needing printing company.HP is a crap brand!"
3,Recipe Box,"This recipe box is really nice, except I thought 4 by 6 recipe cards would fit in it, but they don't. They are just a little too big. Because I had already copied all of my recipes onto the 4 by 6 cards, I couldn't use this recipe box and had to look elsewhere. I kept the box though to use for other purposes because it matched my Desert Rose china."
4,Ah Salchichon...,"You have no idea how many salchichon sandwiches I consumed while in Spain. Neither do I but it was a lot. Salchichon is somewhat like a hard salami but milder and less greasy. This particular product is pretty close to the salchichones I had in Spain. I prefer salchichon to chorizo for sandwiches but I prefer chorizo for eating as-is. Now someone just needs to open a good bakery around here that makes a good so-called ""french"" bread like the ones I had in Spain."
3,Bleak New Zealand...,"From the author of ""Once Were Warriors"" comes another gritty tale set in New Zealand's underclass. This book focuses exclusively on two thieves Jube (white), and Sonny (half-Maori) who also share an apartment. Their miserable existence sitting around a nasty bar full of ex-cons is rendered in full detail as they drink through the weekly welfare check. Jube is a insecure loudmouth of the kind that likes to drive his muscle car real fast and brag about everything. Sonny is more of a thinker and feels trapped and out of place. One night they rob a fancy house and score big, changing both their lives. It's a pretty nasty read, and gets a little tiresome at times as the duo move through a familiar cycle of hopelessness. Duff strings the two men's conversation together into single blocks so that who's saying what is a little confusing at times. Reminiscent in some ways of the Australian film ""Romper Stomper."""
5,Delivered as Promised!!,Received the Action Jacket on time and as promised. Appreciated them meeting the delivery schedule as it was a gift for me wife...
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM,"HELLO,I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO A REVIEW, SINCE I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE BOUGHT ITEM IN THE MAIL. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT I CAN DO TO RECEIVE THE ITEM I BOUGHT. WHO DO I CONTACT? I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS, SINCE I DIDN'T RECEIVE IT IN THE MAIL. THANKS!V/R,TRASY"
5,How did I Miss This!,"Wow! What a great record. I stumbled upon this music while researching the recording timeline of the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ). This intriguing music gave me another unique perspective on John Lewis' compositional skills and how he uses different colors and textures to convey his musical ideas. This disc swings nicely and is very subtle at first listen. It grows more intensely with each additional listen. After my third time listen around I found myself closing my eyes and drifting into a very calm and pleasant state - feeling like I was wrapped in a warmth and soft glow. I look forward to repeating this experience as often as possible. John Lewis is an exception composer and with ""Kansas City Breaks"", I have a deeper appreciation and understanding as to why I love MJQ's music so much. If you like great Jazz that leaves you in a great place afterwards you should check out ""Kansas City Breaks"". Enjoy!Stan"
5,One of the best products I have ever purchased,The sound is wonderful. The construction is outstanding. I have owned it for over a year and have only good things to say about it. I have it hanging from a branch just outside my screen porch so I get to enjoy its tones very often. I wish I could be able to say this about products I have purchased.
3,Some good tips that you'll want to try,"This is a quick read (less than two hours) but it has enough tips in it, that once you've finished it, you'll want to go back and reread parts of it again.Don't be turned off by the title - this is not a guide to mind manipulation nor will you learn how to hypnotize people. It's a combination between a beginners guide to NLP (neurolinguistic programming), where it breaks down techniques into easy, manageable exercises and a common sense guide to dating, reminding you that if you never leave your house, you'll never meet anyone new.A word of warning though, simply reading this book is not enough to change your life. If you're not willing to try some of Boothman's suggested techniques, nothing will change.Target Audience: You want to be dating more, but you need a more confident and approachable vibe. This will give confidence in the dating scene, and you'll quickly see the more you practice these tips, the more confident you'll become."
5,useful insight and techniques for the dating world,"I stumbled across this book in an airport store and spontaneously bought it anticipating I would share some of it's insights with a singles group I facilitate and utilize it in my singles coaching business. Although I'm not fond of the title, I love the book! I found useful insights and techniques that even I, an experienced dater, will be able to apply to my dating strategies. Two areas I found especially useful were the techniques focused around first dates and the four personality types and what each needs to feel loved. It certainly made me ponder my own dating strategies and whether I could be even more effective given these techniques.Although I haven't yet personally used the strategies, I recommended the book to a friend who applied some of the techniques to a first date and reported a much more enjoyable experience than usual."
5,Amazing Book,"This book gave great insight into communication. A very good read. Makes you look at things differently. I loved it, Looking forward to reading more of his work."
4,Be more charming...,"I was inspired by the simplicity and practicality of Boothman's approach. This audio book is packed with tips on how to connect to people and is presented by the author in a snappy and entertaining way. When you've finished it, you'll want to go back and listen it again. It's insights help me to be more charming when interacting with other people instead of more alarming! :-)"
2,Average.,"This book is okay and does serve a purpose.This is a book to give you some guidelines on dating for men and women.Its all commen sense here.Nothing here that hasnt been printed in other dating type books.Has some ideas.The author doesnt stay focused for long.He must have remembered things as he was writing.Its a distraction.For men,if you want good books on how to meet women I recommend these:1)""Understanding women"" By Romy Miller.2)How to pick up girls!"" By Eric Weber.3)""The pocket idiots guide to getting girls"". By Lisa Altalida.4)Booby trapped:men beware! The dirty seven sisters.(the author alse wrote a similar book for women).You can buy all these books right here."
2,Narrow market,"Surely this book has taken niche marketing too far. I know that in the modern age companies have realised that limited sales to smaller markets can still be a cost-effective way of selling; a book (or any other product) doesn't always have to be a mega-seller to make it worthwhile from the seller's point of view. With the publication of this book, though, I think the publishers must realise they've hit the wall. Making a great first impression is all very well, but how many people with 90 minutes or less to live are going to care about building a lasting relationship?"
3,"Slightly dated, useful nonetheless","Published in 1992, before the advent of the full line and subcompacts, this is a useful resource for Glock devotees, critics, writers, and perhaps most of all, the media. The ""debate"" about Glocks still rages and misconceptions still abound more than a decade after it was written. Covers the genesis and history of Glocks, the media fiasco, early lawenforcement resistence, the original 9mm models, Glock pistols from the inside out, how they function, maintenance, design features, operational advantages, early accessories and a small resource list. Useful both for the casual owner and the aficianado as well. You should come away with an understanding of how ignorant Glock bashing really is."
5,Spectacular,"This book on Glock guns features all information about this ""terrorizing"" weapon ranging from its establishment by Glaston Glock, its details of each model, to other Glock accessories such as knives, etc. Couldn't be more useful!"
1,Do Not Use This On Plastics,"I purchased this (Krylon Fusion Spray Paint) to paint some Rubbermaid Totes that I had. I read on the label that it could take up to 7 days for it to become scratch proof. Well that is a flat out lie. I waited the 7 days and the paint chips and peels so much, I had to throw away the totes. Now I'm out the cost of the paint and totes.Take it from me, if you need to paint plastics, then find another product or else you will possibly ruin your item or at the very least have to buy a paint stripper and be out the cost of the paint, stripper and labor."
1,Doesn't work,"I have used this on lawn furniture which chipped off and then, thinking it chipped because the furniture was out in the weather, tried it again on molded plastic chairs that I painted for my daughter's 50's style dining set. One can of paint gives 2 chairs a thin coat. I spent $4.99 a can for 6 cans to paint 4 small chairs--took 3-4 coats. The paint kept chipping so I spent more money buying more cans to touch up. So far it's never ending and we'll end up throwing the chairs away. I would not recommend this product to anyone and would like to get my money back, but know that will be a lost cause."
5,Fantastic!,I have been using this product for about 7 years now. I refinished a plastic louge chair first & just redid it last year. No problems at all. This year I am redoing a kids play set. I am sure it will be great!
4,Up to par,"This product was exactly as I expected it. I own and manage a high-end custom cabinet company, and we use these bits all day long. The two-piece design allows for a denser square bit material, and should last long."
4,This book is good,This book is about when Amos and Dunc found a note in the cannon. The note told them that there was a timeportal that sent them back to World War 2. They had to write about the World War at school. there was a man that was standing there that thought that Amos and Dunc were prisoners. the bad thing Ididn'tlike how the aurthor wrote the book. If you want to read more about this book check it out at your library.
4,Surprising and gripping book,"Honestly, this book sat on my shelf for five years. I kept avoiding it, although I loved *The Passion*. But, all I finally picked it up the other day and all I can say is wow, I am sorry I waited so long. First of all, I never expected it to be so FUNNY! The ""genderless"" (read: female) narrator's description of previous relationships were hilarious. This allowed the rest of the book where it was by turns lyrical and sad to just soar. Winterson's prose is some of the finest around. Don't wait to read this..."
3,Sometimes The Best Company Is Your Own,"That line is in this book. Jeanette is a wonderful writer. I loved underlining so many passages in this book. There was one line about how life is a maze and we all seek to get out of it in order to win. She wrote about how we ALL take our parents wherever we go. And she reminded me that Kinsey found that so many prefer sex in the afternoon (right after I saw the movie KINSEY, starring Liam Neeson). She is very original in the way she tells a story. I'd recommend this to anyone who has ever had an affair or thought of having one. You'll get some interesting insight."
2,Whine Upon the Body,"This was a book club read and initially I was looking forward to it. I read that it was written with a narrator sans gender...interesting with potential, but in the end it just ended up being boring, redundant and whiney.I will say that it was beautifully written--poetic, descriptive, vivid. But ohhh my...could we please stop the whining?!Weak characters in books, as in life, are full of self-centeredness and excuses...unfortunately this book was full of the same...I had high hopes...but alas...it was not to be."
4,love is a strange thing,"great book. a look at love stripped to its bare essence. Told thru the eyes of a narrator of unknown gender. Interesting idea, and you find it doesn't really matter.Love transcends gender.Many great philosophical meditations. Do not be afraid of love. Without it life is like a broken poem.the best line is about the distinction between passengers and customers."
3,"lovely prose, mundane topic","This tale is derivative -- see, for instance, The End of the Affair, which is the same thing, only different. But it is a skillfully done soft porn tale of obsession and intellectualized lust. The voice of the narrator, self absorbed and libidinous, is nicely unisexed, so even at the end of the book the reader is still wondering ... though, of course, we know, don't we -- because the London tabs have told us.Still, certainly a lovely bedtime read and a book to share with a lover."
5,One of my favorites,"I've read this book twice over the last few years, and the second reading was even better than the first. Winterson's writing is nothing short of exquisite. I wanted to drown in her words, they moved me that much. Truly a beautiful book, and I look forward to reading it again."
2,made me laugh out aloud,"JW writes fluently and well .... BUT at times she is shamefully self-indulgent: ""I looked into her hands and thought 'here is the campfire that mocks the sun'""? puh-lease! skip the middle bit with the anatomy-waffle. the first few examples are interesting but as with any gimmick it loses its appeal and becomes predictable, merely an exercise to be completed. the ending was good, though - unexpected."
5,Great book to re-read at different times in your life,"Although ""Written On The Body"" can go off on a few more tangents than I'd prefer, it is otherwise a stunning work of art. The words of this novel are often more like lyrics than prose, and the characters are richly explored. I've had this book for 5 years now and read it at least a dozen times; each time I read it I get something else out of it. Especially good to re-read at different stages of your life, since I think the meaning you might draw from it as a young adult, for example, will differ from what you see in it at 30, or 50, or 60.My only other criticism is that the story has a somewhat tedious beginning. But in the end, it's definitely worth slogging through (or skipping the beginning altogether on subsequent reads, as I do)!"
4,twisting and tangling passion with confusion and wisdom,"Written on the Body pulled me down into the thoughts of the narrator- there were giant holes for me to fall into Alice-like, there were no places of emptiness, only new kettles of fish- the narrator gives you a green view of passion- of decisions, of human behaviour in the context of love, and i tore through it quickly- an enjoyable read, not heavy, not light, and definately caught between poetry and novel."
5,Wonderful,"In a college course, Writing The Body, I was assigned ""Written on The Body"" to read. From the first word to the last I was enthralled. The story is intriguiging and the language is intoxicating and irresistable. This is the most beautiful book I have ever read."
1,Worst book i ever read,"This book doesn't make it as poetry, does not make it as a good romance novel, does not make it as a good memoir, and fails miserably as an example of an alternative lifestyle of lesbianism."
3,What's the big deal about this book?,"I found the characters to be extremely flat. The main character did not have an identity of his/her own. He/she didn't have a life beyond going from woman to woman. I need to know much more to be able to like a character. I could not connect with any of the characters in this book.Though I did quite like the description of a kiss between two people unsure of their roles. (The Denise kiss, if you've read the book.)"
3,got what i needed but not great.,"I needed this for a class so i wasn't too concerned with how it was, but there were notes written in the book and i tihnk i remember this copy being described as in pretty good condition."
2,Barely worth it,"The only parts of this book that stand out are the anatomically-titled sections, which feature the most original writing in the book. Within these sections the body of the loved one is examined and glorified in poetic prose. JW can spin a good phrase occassionally but over all the book failed to arouse the same passion that other readers experienced. The fact that the gender of the narrator is left ambiguous neither distracts nor adds to the book. Also, I was unable to care for the characters. This was my first JW fiction book to read. I am still planning on trying _The Passion_. I hope it is more rewarding than this book."
3,It's a Girl!,"While I enjoyed reading this book it's obvious that the proclaimed ""genderless"" narrator is a woman. The author is going to have to do more than not use gender specific pronouns, etc., to make this story genderless."
4,very descriptive,"it was very descriptive and all but I believe the character was a male and the feminist, lesbian author did a good job of making the protagonist a male."
1,Tedious and narrow,"This book was selected by my book group and I had to choke it down. The characters felt like stick figures with narcissitic personality disorders, the ambiguity around gender didn't really go anywhere - was it just chosen to titillate?, and I got really tired of the narrator feeling so sorry for him/herself. Whaa, whaa, whaaa. Get a life, I wanted to scream."
5,Larger Than Life,"This is a beautifully written book that digs deep beneath the surface of the main character, to define what it means to be truly in love. Winterson has a very lyrical writing style in this novel, the flow of her words takes you deep into the love our protagonist has for Louise. To sum it up, ""What you risk reveals what you value."""
5,Begin the roller coaster ride!,"And what a ride Marmalade Boy is! This series is long but the manga moves pretty quickly.You'll fall in love with all the great characters, especially our main hero and heroine - Yuu and Miki-chan.This series is pure soap opera by the way, with angst and drama by the bucket full. I plan to get them all!"
5,Best manga ever!!!!,"Marmalade Boy is the best series. There's no magical powers or weight-lifting girls. It's a down to earth story that you'll love. The first thing I noted when I saw the books were the incredible artworks. There's ads in the back of all mangas, compare Marmalade Boy's artwork to the rest, you'll see what I mean. It's no surprise that Marmalade Boy is Wataru's best selling manga series. Don't listen to the people who hate Marmalade Boy. If you need more insight, go to a bookstore and read a few pages of it, you'll see what I mean."
3,Great quality but way too heavy,"These wings are beautiful and looked great too, but the jewels made them way too heavy to wear. If I had known they were going to be like that, I would have went with the cheap child wings....the good thing about the childrens wings are that I would have been able to wear them all night and people would have known what I was....instead I wore the purple fairy wings for all of 10 minutes. Beautiful and well made, but way too heavy."
4,Quite good,"This is a very savory honey. It reminds me of a weak liqueur. There is a malted flavor I can't quite place, like a mild bourbon or whiskey. There is also a caramel or molasses undertone. While it may overpower mild tasting teas, it would be good in black tea or strongly flavored herbals. I look forward to cooking with this; I think it will be good."
2,BETTIE PAGE ACTION FIGURE CLEOPATRA,My son is fascinated with Bettie Page. I thought the action figure would be a nice addition to his collection of her. It really didn't look like her that much. He kept her simply for a conversation piece but we were disappointed in the likeness.
5,A New Appreciation for Police Work,Rick Stone's new book kept me on the edge of my seat. I especially enjoyed the behind-the-scenes details of professional police work. I admire those special relationships that exist among the cops on the street which are at the core of this scintillating novel.
3,Too much C++ and not enough builder,"I bought this book to get an introduction to Windows development using Borland Builder 4.Now, I must say that if a person knows little C/C++ then this book is good bacause it leans towards teaching basics of this first.However, for someone that is not new to C/C++ there are a lot of pages to jump over. Then there is not enough builder. You get the basics, enough to get started but...In conclusion a good book if beginning to program in C/C++ but not really for the advanced."
4,Slow to switch and dumb software,"First off, the image is very, very good. It's clear and bright from multiple viewing angles.If you only plan on using a single video source, this is a very good monitor.That said, if you plan on using this monitor with two video sources, be prepared for slow switching between video sources. It takes about 2 seconds to display video from the other video source when you switch. I've twiddled the monitor settings trying to get it to remember settings so it can instantly switch back and forth but no luck there."
4,Silver or Art?,I give this 4 stars for the effort to get our country's inflation in control. I support the liberyt dollar movement and the abolition of the federal reserve. I just can't see the reason for buying silver at a higher price when the value is in the silver metal itself and not the artistic design of the gold or silver. Silver have been hovering around $12-$14 dollars per troy ounce. Paying extra for the clean cut design is more Art appreciation than it is silver value itself. I have alot of gold and silver bullion but I would have to have a pretty good reason to pay a premium price for the same amount of precious metal content than any other bullion bar/coin. Maybe I don't understand bullion vs currency.Vote Ron Paul!!!
5,Popular Intro to the Field of Christian Apologetics,"Geisler is a philosopher by education and has been a author of many apologetic works. This text serves many as an intro into the field.Geisler is a Thomist in his approach as an Evangelical Protestant. He first builds a test for truth claims, then applies each worldview (philosophy) to this criteria. Then, having shown theism to be true, he presents evidence for its claims.Primarily does Geisler rely upon the tests of unaffirmability for a false worldview, and undeniability for a true worldview.When moving on from theism to its competing worldviews (Judaism, Islam, etc.) Geisler abandons the previous tests and uses rather ""systematic consistency.""For this reviewer's apologetics, Geisler cides too much on the reason side. I prefer more of a classical approach, particularly William Lane Criag."
1,Well written falsehoods,"This book simply fails. It misrepresents several of the worldviews it attempts to undermine, and for most of them it doesn't adequately logically refute them (though it claims to). But if you read this without a critical eye, it's easy enough to get past that. The real disappointment will hit you if you're a Christian hoping to find a solid adequate defense of Christianity. You want find it. It's more or less the same old arguments reworked that have already been adequately rebutted. He asserts that everything except God is a contingent being by nature. Whereas God is a necessary being. What about matter/energy? How can he say that's not necessary? Even logically prior to the big bang, matter/energy still existed. There is no known or accepted realm in cosmology at any time when there was ""nothing"" from which God could create something. Matter/energy is eternal, not contingent.His other arguments are equally unconvincing and weak."
4,Great toy that lasts,"My daughter received this as a gift when she was two. She's almost 5 and we still have it in the toy box. This toy is so durable and held her attention longer than most toys, also good for travel."
2,Not fun at all!,"I bought this toy based on great reviews. I needed something to keep my busy 8 months old son occupied, but, unfortunately he didn't care for it at all. He wouldn't even look at it. Maybe, in couple of months he'll like it more. Otherwise, well made toy, but extremely overpriced!"
4,Love this toy!,My seven month old enjoys this toy. Right now she likes shaking and chewing on the little birds. She's not at the stage where she can take them out and put them back in the house but she still has fun playing with this toy.
5,Great for put and take!,"This is such a wonderful toy for teaching put and take. The birdhouse and birds are so colorful and there are lots of different textures. There are also several holes in the birdhouse - so there are different ways to move the birds. My daughter LOVES put and take - so I knew this would be a big hit when she got it for her 1st birthday. And it was - she still likes to play with this toy at 19 months. It has a carrying handle, which is good for kids who like to carry things around (as my daughter does). This birdhouse is also great for practicing fine motor skills - pulling the birds out and putting them back in. Opening the door and roof is excellent practice as well! Awesome beginning learning toy!"
5,Perfect for little baby hands!,"My 6 month old LOVES these birds. They're the perfect size for her little baby hands. Right now, she just chews on them, but she's starting to learn to drop them in their little bird house."
5,Manhattan Toy Put and Peek Birdhouse,"This is one of the cutest baby toys I've ever seen! I bought it for my 1-year-old granddaughter for Christmas. She knew just what to do with it. I wanted to play, too. Squeezing the darling little birdie puffballs made me a baby again. This is one toy I wouldn't bother to pick up and put away. It's too cute."
2,Kind of lame,This toy is kind of lame. The roof is hard to keep open in order to put the birds into it. It did not interest my 1 1/2 year old.
2,Bummer for my 1yo boy,"I purchased this toy based on the great reviews for my son's first birthday. He does not care about this toy in the least. He never picks it up to play with it. He would much rather play with ""guys"" or cars. Looking back I wish I would have purchased the ""dog"" version of this toy as he may have had a little more interest in it. That said, it really is a beautiful, well-made, ""no batteries"" toy, just not enjoyed in my house."
3,Not much use,"I bought this for my granddaughter a year ago, and she hardly plays with it. The house must have a cardboard form under the fabric, because it has gotten warped by being in the toy chest. I can't straighten it out, that and the fact that she doesn't enjoy playing with it, and the cost, means that it was a waste of money buying it."
2,not fun at all,"My nephew who is 1 year old does not care for this toy at all. I thought it would be bigger in size, but disappointingly the birds are tiny and so is the bird house. it really isn't all that fun taking the birds out and in repeatedly."
5,Great toddler toy,This toy is an excellent addition to any toddler toy collection. My 1-year-old loves it. She loves to carry it around the house by the handle and take the little birds out and put them back. She also puts other things in the little bird house. She hasn't show this much interest in a toy before. I highly recommend this fun and safe educational toy.
5,Best toy ever for curious tot,My 11 month old LOVES this toy. I mean LOVES. It's great for the curious kid who likes to open and close things. Sometimes in the morning I put this in her crib and then go back to sleep for 15 min! She stays totally occupied.
3,Okay toy,I thought this we going to be a little more entertaining for my 1 year old. The birds ended up getting spread around the house and he didn't dig going through the house as much as I hoped. He did spend some time opening and shutting the lid.I would recommend this only if you can find it cheap. or cheep! ha ha!
5,Fabulous!,"My grandaughter loves this toy, she is learing to put the birdies back in their house and enjoys teething on the edge of the house at times. She will cuddle the birds and when she pulls one out I will tell her the colors of the birds so she learns her colors. She loves the handle on the house and wraps her fingers around it easily. This is a ""soft toy"" so if she falls over sitting up and lands on it she meets soft landing which I have found it important. Some of the other toys are hard plastic and when you hit them tumbling over they can create a booboo. A good cautious toy when they are just learning how to sit up and want to play with thir toys. It holds her attention for awhile. A good choice for 5-10 month old babies!"
5,Always the best quality,"There is another review on here that I did today for a third-party compatible cartridge. It wasn't good. We used Lexmark cartridges in the past. I believe four to date, and tried a cheaper one. It wasn't worth it. A week later we bought this genuine cartridge and the quality returned. With the bad cartridge our mailing labels smudged and so did many document. With this cartridge there is no smearing and documents are crisp.I am one of those people that don'e always pay the premium that is asked of companies that sell overpriced ""native"" supplies, but in this case it seems to be worth the extra cost if you care about quality. The toner is just better."
2,Lexmark Toner,This toner is too expensive for the number of pages it prints. I think Lexmark sells their printers cheap and then rips off the customers on the cost of the toner. Next time I'll check on the price of the toner before I buy the printer!
3,Meh,Wasn't very impressed with this book. There isn't any information in it that you can't find in a quick Google search.
1,Don't buy it,"Very disappointing book. Information in this book pertains to any breed. If you want a book with information on the rat terrier - background, health issues, temperament, conformation, types, colors, breeding concerns - and the like - this isn't it. Buy the Hibbard book or Anne Blair's book. These people know ratties."
5,Buy this book!,"I bought both this book and the Linda Hibbard book. I could have just purchased this one because I think it is the best of the two. It covers everything! A very comprehensive book for me.I am an experienced mother of 4 kids, but I have never had a dog before,so I needed to know everything! I re-read parts of it all the time to help me be a good mommy to my rat terrier puppy. It has everything from the History of the rat terrier to training and behavior and vaccinations and everyday care. The training section has been particularly helpful."
1,Disappointing Item -- Old and Shabby-looking,"Video item was described online as a used item. But I never imagined how used and very worn it looked. It was not just used and worn, but it even had an old Bronx Library sticker still on it. Very disappointing appearance, so there was no way I was going to wrap it up as a Xmas gift.I just handed it to the family that would soon be moving to Tokyo and explained that, if the DVD worked, it was simply for their information before moving there."
1,A travesty,"Having listened to the Prologue alone, I tuned out. The tuning is too high, the engineering incessantly forte all around, the allegri are too presto -- sometimes it's so fast that the music can't be heard. Incredibly brusque and unmusical, this recording cannot be recommended at all."
2,Kind of good,I read this for school and hated it. It was hard to understand. Now that I've re-read it I seem to like it a bit more but it still is not that good. Read the Odyssey instead
4,Very unusual.....kind of a regency - cw historical in one...,"This book has much to recommend it. Mostly the incredible research that the author has done which lends itself to obvious authenticity. This starts as a 300 page 'harlequin' that usually, to me, means little depth. But I love civil war era stuff so I read it anyway. We have the typical injured yankee anddevoted reb belle.....and the belle trying to get out of an arranged marriage which leads to a prank where she meets our embittered hero. Pretty standard stuff. There aren't any hot love scenes, just tender words and emotions conveyed through sharkespeares sonnets and a few embraces. The 'hero' volunteers to get arrested so he can lead a bunch of officers out of libby prison...and the reality of the nightmare of that prison are fairly vivid. You'll either like this story or dislike it a lot, I guess but I enjoyed the change of pace. The author did a really good job fitting in historical info in a easy read."
4,A tear jerker,"This was a bit of a roller coaster ride. Amy was such a sweetheart, the all-American girl. While the kids around her wandered through their lives without purpose, Amy knows what she wants to do. Unfortunately cancer intervenes and the peppy little encourager of all others finds herself in the position of needing some encouragement. This had a nice subtheme about interacting with kids who are loners. The acting was decent, allowing us to get emotionally involved in the threat to Amy's life. Definitely worth watching."
1,Two strikes and your out,"I ordered The Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker in anticipation of a summer of barbecue. Unfortunately, the unit arrived structurally damaged. Based on the state of the box, I would say it occured prior to UPS picking it up, but have no way of knowing. Sadly, the replacement unit was also damaged. There were huge dents that broke the welded seal. I gave up, have requested a refund from Amazon, and will seek a different brand of smoker. I would definitely advise not to buy this product."
1,Do not buy this smoker,"I bought a Great Outdoors gas grill several years ago and like it. I thought the smoker would be the same quality. It is not. First, the smoker came damaged in several places, enough so that the door would not close. Second, it is not made of heavy gauge steel, it is more like the steel around air conditioning ducting in your attic. Never used it, and have been trying to return it ever since. The only thing worse than the smoker is Amazon's customer service. I have not been able to get it retuned, they are not responding. The smoker is made in China, they used to be made here. Evidently Great Outdoors has been sold a couple of times, and now is a big supplier to Wal-Mart which explains how they have gone from high quality to tin metal. I researched this smoker and found mostly good reviews on barbeque sites. But they are a couple of years old, from when these things were made here. Overall, this has been a very bad experience. I will not be continuing as an Amazon customer."
4,An appropriate blend of vocals and drums,"LADY DRUMMER is even more focused on an appropriate blend of vocals and drums: harmonies introduce the drums in the first cut 'Legba salute', and Fatu retains that delicate, welcome balance between percussion and vocal which sets her sound and cds apart from the usual West African all-drum compilation."
5,very good,worth seeing. very comprehensive. the main issues are addressed. eye-opening and well worth a view for a good overall introduction to the basic problems of healthcare coverage.
2,Slurped to Death,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to agree 100% with Joost Kiefter on this. Billy May's signature ""slurping sax"" sound was done TO DEATH on his recordings. I much prefer the albums he did to back singers, because he didn't rely on one gimmick continually. Billy May was a wonderful arranger, but he fell into a trap of his own devising."
4,Billy May,This CD is one of the best of all Billy's collection; his orchestra is simply wonderful to listen and dance.
2,The children in the background sound far far away!,"This seems like this could be a fun Spanish program but whenever the children speak you have to strain to hear them. Also, the exercises to try to learn the Spanish are not fun or interesting."
3,poor sound quality,"Nice product, but tracks 4-11 on disc one have terrible sound quality. I don't know if this was a problem with just my copy, but the publisher refused to replace it, and exchage time had expired on Amazon. Beware. - Johanna"
3,"From a teacher's perspective, not bad","I bought this to use with my four to seven year old Spanish class. I didn't use it because I didn't feel it was clearly and concisely introducing words or phrases - it seems a little confusing for that age group.I do like the bright colors and that there are CD's with the set, as well as the songs (which REALLY help little kids learn a second language.) As a parent and teacher, I just wish it was a little less jumbled in the lessons...Not a lot of writing to do - just reading and listening. There are many more interactive approaches out there, which comes with a CD, or you can get some board books in Spanish by Boynton or Wemberley. Ana Lomba has several good child-focused products as well.Sra. GoseMother, Teacher, AuthorFlip Flop Spanish Series"
3,disappointing sound quality,"I purchased this set for our five year old daughter. She as ""studied"" Spanish a bit in her Montessori pre-school program (songs, counting, very simple stuff) and I thought this might be a good was to encourage her to pick up as much Spanish as possible at an early age.At first I was very happy with the set. The workbook is very colorful and engaging. The CD audio lessons are fun and fairly logically organized. There are one or two songs per lesson that make it fun for children and keep them interested.However -- somewhere around lesson 3 the audio quality deteriorated dramatically. It sounds as if the CD was copied off of a warped cassette tape or something. It is not totally incomprehensible, but it is hard to listen to. I don't understand this, especially since the first couple lessons were fine. We're going to try a few more lessons and see if the sound returns to normal -- if not, I may have to return this."
2,"Would be great, but the sound is garbled","We enjoyed the first couple of lessons, and I was really excited about these cds. Unfortunately, the sound became almost completely incomprehensible after the first few lessons, sounding almost like a robotic or synthesized voice. I see other reviews that complain about this, too, so purchase this at your own risk. It's hard to imagine that a company would ship so many defective cds, especially cds where sound quality and comprehension are the most important aspects!"
2,I have to agree with the others...,"I was really ready to like this product, because the book is charming, and the presentation of concepts is good. It appears quite kid-friendly. However, the sound quality is the pits. It sounds like an old inferior analog recording put straight over to disk. My opinion is that this is a defective product."
2,Misleading!,"Don't be mislead by the title and picture. In the title is tays ""...Tablets 120 each"" and there is a picture of a twin pack. IT IS ONLY ONE, 1, UNO BOTTLE! Ethical advertising would dictate having an appropriate picture or at least describing it as only 1 bottle of 120 tablets."
4,Talent,"I was introduced to this CD and, despite initial my initial cynicism, it is great from start to finish (I can't figure out which song is my favorite, probably Firefly, Best of Me or Cold July). It has resided in my CD player for the last month and I can hardly wait for her new album which I heard is coming soon."
1,No attention to detail,"We saw the movie last year with my then 2 year old who loved the movie. We bought The Polar Express book and he loves having it read to him. This year we bought the DVD and he has watched it many times this Christmas season. Someone gave my mother The Magic Journey and when we read it to my now 3 year old he has found some of the errors in it and I have found more. Some of the pictures are directly from the movie and others are not. The Lonely Boy, Billy, is dressed differently at the beginning of the book than he actually was in the movie and is at the end of the book. The hero boy pulled the brake in the engine to stop for the cariboo, not the girl. There are more errors than this, too many to list. Don't buy this book, buy the original. It is beautifully written and illustrated. This book is a joke."
1,Disturbing and Disgusting Dribble,"Why Disney Film Studios have decided to put their support behind this sacraligous and disturbing novel suprises me. Not even Walt Disney, who lets face it, is not commonly regarded as one of the stalwarts of mental health would treat Cordy's novel as ""normal"".This book is not entertaining.This book is not clever.This book is not good.This book is disturbing.This book is religously corrupt.This book is not the type that should be encouraged, supported, or turned into a feature film.Do not waste your money on this book, especially if you have or at any time have at any semblance of religous faith. If you possess any compassion or understanding of Christian ideals, again, do not purchase this book. You will regret it."
3,"Nice idea, but... eh...","The main character's side-kick didn''t seem to do much except hang around, and I wasn't too fond of the doctor to begin with. Cordy kept doing this annoying thing of building up to something - only for nothing to happen. After the third or fourth time I got really bored. Nice idea, average execution."
4,"A definate ""must read""","From start to finish Mr. Cordy displays a storytelling talent that makes me wonder if this is really his first novel. The characters are real people with fears, hopes and expectations that come alive page after page"
5,A great book,This debut novel for Cordy is great. It poses a very interesting question: what would we find in the genes of Christ? A great science fiction thriller with a religious twist. I am a devout Christian and I loved this book. You should read it. I heard it's being made into a movie. It would do very well as a movie and be a relief from most junk movies of present. Everybody should read this!
2,"Techno_religious bable, the strain.","Writen in a formulaic way using the two main subjects of the day: religion and genetics. Hey , why not mix and match and apply the principles of good movie-making (not book writing)? I have nothing against best-sellers except if the stink like one. This one does. An all-powerful secret society keeping the flame ,a serial killer with the same genetics as Christ, a machine developed single-handedly to create holograms of bodies from a strain of their genetic material . Sounds good, could have been good, but it isn't.Too much of a faith leap for a book. Did I mention a movie deal ?"
2,Unconvincing science makes for unscary reading,"Science, medicine and even technology make great subjects for thrillers, but only when the science is believable and the plot at least passably believable. There are so many gebuinely scary developments in the world today that a writer who has the power to take you inside them, helps you to understand them, while at the same time telling a compelling story with well-drawn characters, can work wonders. The problem with this book is that it does none of these things. The scientific part relies up geniuses (ordinary folk, you know) and becomes less and less credible as it goes on; and as for the secret brotherhoods and global conspiracies, well... they belopng in the world of pure fantasy. Fantasy, of course, can be wonderful, but if it that's what it is, why not propel your story along with magic instead of all the bogus and inaccurate science. There are better reads in the science thriller genre than this by far. Pete Singletary"
3,Little League's Official How-To-Play Baseball Video,"I actually have had this tape for a few years. And yes it may seem outdated to the younger coaches, but the tape is for the players. I have shared this tape with all of the youth teams I have coached over the last eight years and have had great response from those who paid attention to the tape and concentrated on their particular position. A player can get in front of the TV and mimic what they see on the tape."
2,Almost Unwatchable,"I bought this video for my six-year old who is fanatical about playing baseball. While there is a lot of information in this video, it is explained too quickly to be easily understood. But the biggest problem is the grainy, streaky, poor quality of the video image. Watching the players' bushy hair and the coaches' unflatteringly tight jerseys makes clear that this video was made a long time ago. Since the information is valuable, it would be wonderful if Little League remade the video with modern video technology and sold it as a DVD. Until that happens, this is not a video that is worth your money."
4,review of our tv controller,"Everything seems to be working well; as it is a replacement, we were already familiar with product.Quite pleased with our purchase so far, although have had it only a relatively short period of time."
4,"Works well, but not what I expected","I ordered this remote as a Christmas present to replace a broken remote. It works well, but I purchased mine from WINCHEL'S ELECTRONICS and they sent me the 6.4 remote instead of 6.3. While it still works, I had expected to recieve the 6.3. Either way, the remote works with no problems."
5,What You Didn't Think to Ask Your Obstetrician,"Mom's & Dad's to be: Excellent Book.... Lot's of information that you'll never think to ask until you browse. Doc Poliakin delivered our Son, Edward in Thousand Oaks, CA. There's so many things in this book that are pratical, simple, common sense guidelines with general information to help influence confidence in parent(s) to be. Believe me, he's a down to earth doctor that speaks the truth and reflects it in his book.David Norman"
5,The perfect pregnancy book!!,"I highly recommend this book to all expectant mothers and fathers. This book gives you straightforward and down-to-earth answers to all your questions, without causing undue concern as some other books tend to do. The Q&A format makes it easy to read and refer back to. Buy this book!!"
5,this book helped me make my decision to have LASIK,I was worried about having LASIK and what could go wrong. THis book explained it in terms that I could understand. The photos and illustrations were also very helpful. I would recommend it to anyone considering LASIK
5,A must-read for anyone interested in luxury retail in America,"A terrific story of a merchant and a store, like few others. He re-invented Bloomingdales in the late 1970's, a model which many other retailers tried to emulate. Truly a ""merchant prince"" in the legacy of people like Charles Tiffany, Marshall Field, Stanley Marcus and Geraldine Stutz. A book as fascinating as Stanley Marcus' ""Minding the Store"". Read it!!!!"
2,Reduced quality from the past,"Disappointed by the decreased quality in is really a medical care device.My old Conair WJ7 Interplak cleaner worked perfectly for about five years. When it finally wore out, I bought a WJ7B from Amazon. I tried it for the first time last night. I was not impressed.The new model has significantly less water pressure. When I accidentally touch the tip of the jet to a tooth, the motor bogs down. The base unit of the new one only weighs about 1/3 as much as the old one, which suggests they've put a much smaller motor inside."
2,WATER HOSE BROKE,"Model WJ7 was used for about a year with no problems during the time I had braces. I was happy with its performance. However, after a year's use, the white water hose became embrittled and cracked, thus I was not able to use the unit. Customer Service provides no replacement hose making the unit worthless. Website provides no useful repair / replacement information. So I surmise this model is a throw away. Very sad!"
3,the last one I had was quiet this one is far from it and doesn't have the water pressure from the pump to give you more.,"bought this and looked all over to fine one and bought this made a big bo bo.this doesn't get the job done, well shop for anouther in the furture."
1,Not a good product,"This product did not work, the water did not come out. It is just sitting on my sink doing nothing."
2,Water jet,I have always bought the same model of Conair Interplak water jets and this recent water jet is not as good. The jet spray is so much weaker than previous Interplak water jets of the same model.
4,Works great,"I had this for well over a year and its working great, only thing is the knob to chnage pressure gets stuck but otherwise good working order."
2,Less than satisfactory,This was a replacement for a Interplak Water Jet I had for approx. 7 years. This product is not as satisfactory. It is really pretty noisy and doesn't seem as powerful.
1,Do not waste your time.,"Purchased this unit two weeks ago and finally returned it. It was less money than water pick---well, you get what you pay for. Half of the time while on the high setting I would only get low power surges. I would move the unit around and this would correct it until the second week were it was just low power. Also, the irrigator tips moved around too easy and I would have to constantly adjust to keep the jets of water in the right direction. As far as I am concerned, this unit is garbage.I went to Bed and Bath and purchased a Water Pick WP-65W and am extreamly happy with its performance. Now get this--this unit on the Water Pick site goes for $$$$, I found it at Bed and Bath for $$$$$, plus I had just received a 20% off one item mailer coupon. At the store, there was also a $$$$Water Pick rebate promotion, until Sept 2003. My final cost was $$$$ plus tax. This ended up costing me less money than the Interplack!!!"
4,No More Poppy seeds......,We highly recommend this product for anyone out there that would like to protect their teeth & have healthy gums because this item really cleans between your teeth with water pressure. Also a great way to get your kids to keep good dental habits They will think this is a fun way to keep their mouth clean & fresh smelling.
1,Save your money,This unit will last between six months and a year before it fails. Maybe sooner if used daily. It's a cheaply made knockoff that's great initially but continually loses pressure with use.
4,Product works but - it's not quite as good as the older model,The product works but... it's not quite as powerful/sturdy as the older version that it replaced. The older one lasted for years.
2,I wanted the Power - But didn't get It,"I had a WaterPik many years ago, and have really missed it. The Interplak just doesn't have enough power. I was able to use Level 7 from day 1. Since it doesn't have much power, I run out of water before making it around my whole mouth. It is better than nothing, but I wish it had more pressure so I would feel more refreshed. My suggestion is - keep looking for a WaterPik."
2,Does a poor job of getting the cleaning done,It simply does not have enough power! The water reservoir is way too compact as well. It's merely 10 ounces! It was annoying to refill the water during the middle of cleaning. I bought a Waterpik brand oral irrigator instead and am much more satisfied.
1,Conair should be ashamed,"Out of the box, this piece of equipment should have worked perfectly. A strong sream of water should have been jetting from the hand-held spout but alas, the stream of water reminded me of one of the stone cherib statues peeing water into a fountain basin.I thought that maybe I got a lemon, but after reading other comments regarding this piece of junk, the odds are I didn't. I will be returning it to where I purchased it for a full refund, unless, between now and then, my opinion on this product can be altered.What a waste of time and money for me as a consumer, the store from which I bought it, and finally the manufacturer. Did they think that letting this mistake of a product was going to be accepted by the public as a vaiable dental aid? What are some of these corporate decision makers thinking? Why? If the answer is money, then that doesn't even make sense. Because everyone loses money on this kind of product offering."
2,"Well, it's not the WJ7","First of all, Target.com is selling the wrong unit. The WJ7 has received rave reviews elsewhere, and I made my selection based on those.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I received was a WJ7R. That ""update"" has not been as well received. I have seen a number of complaints concerning low-pressure on the ""R"".<br /><br />To make matters worse, the unit wouldn't pump. I followed the instructions, including the adddendum inside the reservoir, to the letter and got no water to pump.<br /><br />When I took the defective unit back to Target, all they had on the shelves were the WJ7B, still not what I ordered."
5,BEST WATER PIK YET!,"Many years and several types of water jets, I had to replace the exact same product having plugged it into Argentinian 220 outlet and burned it out. Before this new one arrived, I had a small battery operated travel unit and with twice daily use, continues on its 2 batteries for more than 5 weeks! Amazing.Reading other's reveiws before buying the new product, I bought it anyhow as noise level, etc. was not a concern. The design and large water reservoir makes it available to use 3-4 times before refilling. Its size makes it possible to travel with, too.Anyhow, it is better than the previous one which I loved having and using! I've a mouth full of crowns and my gums and teeth are better for using a water jet.By the way, it is quieter then I expected and plenty of water pressure to spare."
3,Preferred earlier model,"I find that this model does not always come up to full pressure until I've turned it on and off a few times. Very Frustrating. I rarely had that problem with my previous purchase, which I used a couple times a day for over three years. (I replaced the old model because the hose developed a hole.)"
4,Review of Conair WJ7B Interplak Dental Water Jet,"This product works well. The reason I did not give it a five-star rating is that it is not quite as good as its predecessor, in my opinion. (I had been hoping to buy the same product that I was replacing.) This WJ7B model works almost as well as the older model, but it is lighter in weight (which might be preferable to some), and, thus, is more easily knocked off the counter than the older model."
2,Just OK at best,"The Conair WJ7B Interplak Water Jet works but the noise level is high and nearly vibriates off the counter. However, after a few months the water pressure began taking a few minutes to get up to jet speed. The lack of water pressure when you first turn it on is too big of an annoyance."
1,"Terrible power, very cheap","Stick with a better brand. This has a lower price but you'll soon see it in the bottom of the trash like me. It was okay at first -- not as good as the water pik it replaced but alot cheaper. it then steadily lost power until it was down to a trickle after about 9 months. why does nothing last anymore? well, the walmartization of the country demands everything be under a certain dollar amount no matter what a piece of you know what.I'm going back to the better brands that do what they say they'll do."
3,"Reliable, but loud.","We've used this particular product for years. The last one we owned worked for 4 years before the water starts to clog. It's very reliable and does the job pretty well. The problem is it is too loud. If you're looking for a dental jet under $40, this is the one to buy."
2,What were they thinking?,"My wife & I have used an older version of the Interplak for about 3 years before it lost pressure. We decided it was a pretty good buy for $25.99. WRONG! The ""replacement"" is not the same at all. It is:NOISIERHAS LESS PRESSURETHE PRESSURE DOESN'T adjustAND WORSE, it causes static to occur on the TV while running.Don't waste you money on this one. We are very disappointed!"
1,did not work,"I followed instructions exactly as enclosed with product. It worked off and on for about two weeks and then would not work at all. I contacted the company directly and basicly was told ""to bad"".I sent the product back to Amazon for a refund."
3,Conair WJ7BR Interplak Water Jet,The shipper was great. The product was a replacement for a Water Jet that wore out. Over the years it seems the quality of the product is not as good as it used to be. I don't expect this Water Jet to last as long as my last one. I was disappointed in the quality.
2,NOT MADE AS GOOD AS BEFORE,"We've owned the same previously for the last 5 years and the tube finally punctured spraying water out below the stand. Purchased this new one which is supposed to be the same but what a BIG dissapointment. Turning up the power knob to the maximum of 5, this didn't even provide anymore pressure out of the nozzle than a setting of 3. This one is much noisier than our first Water Jet. They must have some third world country putting these together. I would not recommend purchasing this model."
2,Works well for a while...,"I purchased this water jet from another retailer and it worked well for quite a while (when I remembered to use it) - fine for the price. I bought it to clean around my new crown (protecting my investment, you know). It worked very well for that purpose, and since I am the type that detests flossing, this water jet stuff was great. Admittedly, this has been mostly a bathroom counter decoration for me. I clean the dust off occasionally. Last week when I tried to use it, nothing noticeable happened other than a slight ""hum"". I tried another outlet, I tried scrubbing parts clean - nothing worked. I would say the total useable life of my product was perhaps a year (I've had it for around two years)."
4,Conair WJB Interplak Water Jet,"The water takes time to make its way through the hose, but it gets the debris out well."
1,loud or broken,"Had to send it back. Really, really loud. Had one before, this was not the same machine. They made me pay shipping both ways for something that did not work. A rip off! Avoid!"
3,Not likely to replace with same product again,I have to use a water jet dental cleaning system and Conair has cut their costs in the mfg of this. The hose line cracked on my previous one in one yr. and it was out of warranty. Can't say I'd buy another of this brand when this one goes. My original Interplak lasted over 15+ yrs.
2,"Short Life, Low Power","I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out, the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I'd rate this unit as ""build quality: poor, life span: short, effectiveness: disappointing""."
1,Piece of Junk --- Do Not Buy,"1. The attachments are held in place with an O-ring which lost its grip after 2 months.2. The unit doesn't build up enough pressure to clean.WaterPiks kept failing every 2 years, so I tried this and it is much worse. Save your money."
2,Not Enough Power,This water pick has 1/3 the spray force of a Water Pick brand model 72. Be careful not to put warm water in the resevoir of this Conair. The piston will seize and the unit will be done for.
3,You might consider WaterPik first...,"If you go to my review of WaterPik's oral irrigator, you'll see I'm quite critical of their product, although I own one and use it regularly. In fact, Interplak has improved upon quite a number if issues I took with WaterPik. However, Interplak's irrigator simply doesn't measure up.Although I very much like their tub being able to be removed with water still in it without spilling, it's simply too small. Having to add water half way through is a pain in the keister. Also, it's much quieter than WaterPik, but the reason for that is it's motor is much less powerfull.In my mind there's only one decisive factor for choosing this irrigator over WaterPik -- cost. It's half the price.Now, if Conair ever puts out either an improved version of this one, or if they release a Professional version, I myself will burn my WaterPik in my yard and make the conversion happily!"
2,Weak,"Very disappointed with purchase. Had used Conair in the past and worked wonderfully. Expected newer version to be at least up to par or even better. Instead, water pressure is very weak and barely cleans my teeth. Take that into account when purchasing your next irrigator."
1,Am I Blue?,"Yes, it's true. I'm blue.This is a POS. Do not buy. Stay away from all blue receptacle waterpik's that cost below 50.You'll regret it. My last waterpik was Hydrafloss. It lasted two years. I went with el cheapo thinking it would do much the same thing for my teeth.WRONG! It's all cheap plastic. So the water can't get up through the hose due to--poor design. If you do get it to work for a day or so, I commend you.But be warned, if all you hear is motor and there is no water coming up to irrigate your teeth, do what I did; smash it into a thousand pieces and take it back to customer service at Walmart.No you won't get your money back, but the look on their faces is worth the 30 for crap I paid for!"
1,Forget it. Use floss,"The manufacturer says that this device is a supplement to floss. In other words, it cleans the dirt out from between your teeth and thatr is it. You are better off using floss to clean between your teeth plus your gums. My dentist does not recommend using this alone, so why bother and use floss in the first place"
2,Needs A Lid,"It ran good and I liked the different attachments, but I gave it away because I was uncomfortable with not having a lid like my previous one did."
1,A real disappointment,This product is a real disappointment to me since I'd so enjoyed its predecessor ...it would still be in use if I hadn't broken the well. The new one has a very irregular water flow going from Niagara Falls to a slow trickle on its own without touching the controls. It is very irritating and I would not buy one like it again.
1,"NO power, waste of money","I bought this for my kids. After awhile I noticed they weren't using it. They said it didn't do much, so I took it into my bathroom. It's definitely not a Water Pik -- I have had several of those when I was a kid, when I was in college etc, and those all worked great. This thing is terrible! Absolutely no power on any setting and my biggest regret is taking too long to notice -- it was bought many months ago. I will be trashing it and looking for a ""real"" Water Pik soon."
4,Beautiful,"As you may have guessed, a tenor wind chime is big. It's also heavy. And it's also fairly loud, which I had not thought about before the purchase. If you're used to small, high-pitched chimes that you have to pay attention to hear, this is a very different experience. The sound from these chimes is so beautiful that the louder volume is not a problem, except occasionally on a windy night when it was so loud I had to remove the sail thinking it might wake the neighbors. That said, I wouldn't trade these for anything else, as the sound is amazing."
4,"at least a few good points, too much to evaluate easily","Here's what I like:pages 20-21 list of factors in dealing withfeelingspages 25-26 list of mental blockage indicatorspages 30-31 kinds of resistance to changepages 40-48 emotional strategies ==> howto improve emotional intelligence!!!pages 136-138 list of inappropriate communicationtechniques.The general strategies developed in pages 1-96 areapplied later to anxiety, anger, loneliness, depression.An appendix expands this list to confusion, disappointment,envy, facial tics, frustration, guilt, and helplessness."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"This book is an excellent guide to ""Hands On Healing"" for horses. It is a very practical and compassionate book. It will give you the confidence to give safe and effective healings to your horse. I recommend it for both beginning and advanced healers."
1,Believe the haters,"OK, so maybe ""hate"" is too strong a word. The trouble with this album is that it's so different from the previous one. It's like we're in an alternate dimension and SBL is the same in name only. If you liked the debut album, and don't like disco/70s-funk style music, then don't buy this album. The melodies are forgettable, generic and derivative. I'm very disappointed."
2,run of the vanilla mill,"I loved the first album, and was expecting big things from their sophomore effort. SBL did not deliver. This sounds like every other neo-lounge release out there, and I just hated the James Bond vibe. Go buy Shirley Bassey stuff for that; at least she's the original. There is nothing inspired, unique or original about this album (again, unlike their first release). Whatever influence the departed members of the band had, SBL needs that back, and badly."
1,Not as good as the first album,"If you liked the first album, don't buy this one.The first album was really lounge-like--cool and laid back just like the picture on the cover of the album.This album has a horrible cover that reminds me of an adult contemporary album from the early 90s. And the music is just as lame. They went from making cool music to lame attempts at house/funk/disco.It's too bad. This band was so good, and now...they leave much to be desired."
2,Never the same band twice....,"I wrote a longer review but I guess ""they"" don't want to post it. This album has hints of the first album on it but the hints seem deliberate and not creative. Call it growth but I'd rather this seed stayed dormant. I really wished I would have a second album as tasty as the first. If you want to to buy this new album wait for it in the used section. You'll thank me later."
2,Nowhere nearly as good as the debut...,"They lost that edgy, modern sound in exchange for a more disco/funk theme. The debut was a lot more...innovative? The only standout tracks on this CD are ""So Much More"" (has that awesome trip-hop beat to it, sorta like some of the works from Lamb), and maybe ""Rock And A Hard Place"". The others are okay, these must be tracks that take a long time to get used to. If you wanna check them out and have neither album, definitely check out their 2000 self-titled debut."
3,Somewhat underwhelming,"Based on the fact that I like most of the CDs and artists listed in the ""customers of this album also bought these ones"" list, I thought to check this CD out via a birthday gift certificate. My biggest gripe is that stylistically it is inconsistent and does not flow well when listened to straight though. While I definitely dig the more chill, ""James Bondish""(to borrow another reviewer's apt phrase) tunes, w/ the exception of ""Divine"" the more peppy disco-ish songs come off as ersatz and disrupt the mood set by the more low-key selections. On the other hand, the female vocals are excellent and come close to redeeming this album in and of themself. Ultimately, however, I only like about 1/2 the songs on this album, which is why I am somewhat underwhelmed upon listening to it."
3,"Edge of interest gone, replaced by disco guitar","When I got the previous album, shortly after it came out, I was in love. The music was hypnotic, mellow, and interesting. It was unlike anything I've heard before or since. Close, certainly, to Morcheeba, but with a distinct sound that was all their own.The new album seems to have effectively removed that distinct sound and replaced it with the wakka-chika guitars and homogenized strings of a bygone disco era. It's still smooth, mellow, and even hypnotic in places, but it's no longer interesting. This sound seems to be available on any number of other albums.I'll give the band credit for putting out a well-produced album, full of cohesive songs, but something vital is missing.I'll hold on to my copy of the album for now, but after several playings, the music still fails to grab me."
3,I can dig it,"from the first album i was expecting a downtempo set but you know true music is diverse so I will say the ""house music"" feel was a nice change of pase. some of the songs just keep me listening and listening"
4,Mostly Information back to Revolutionary War,"My Grandmother wrote this book. There were only 100 copies made, as far as I know. My mother has a few copies left. It is dry reading but it does trace the Warburton ancestors back to the Revolutionary War."
1,Fell Apart the First Day!,"The content of this book is great, but the binding is JUNK! The whole purpose of a field guide is for it to be a handy reference tool you can flip through frequently. Too bad we now have to shuffle through a pile of loose pages to get at the information. Big disappointment."
2,Great while it lasted,"I purchased 2 for my restaurant, to be used daily. It had issues the first time I had to replace the staples, but we got that sorted. Both staplers have gotten jammed and had to be fiddled around with to be fixed. One of them we decided not to waste our time fixing anymore so I'm going to buy another- a different one. The other one doesn't have much life left (it's been 4 1/2 months for both). It was great while it lasted and I like the upright feature. But they don't last long with daily use so I won't be buying again."
1,Horrific,"I only wish Steve Miller's review had been posted on Amazon before I purchased this. I cried knowing I just spent money on STARWARS 1999 Dance Mix . It's ambient, repetitive electronica w/drum machines (mixed over [sometimes with]simple Star Wars melodies) made me wish I was stuck in an elevator listening to muzac. I was compelled to read Amazon's return policy on CD's after playing it through. Unfortunately, I opened it, thus, I bought it."
5,DEZROK IS THE BOMB !!,IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GREAT SOUND YOU FOUND IT HERE! DEZROK MADE THE BEST REMIX EVER OF STAR WARS!!! THIS CD IS A MUST BUY! IF YOU THINK THIS IS GOOD CHECK OUT DEZROK.COMM ! HE IS THE BOMB!!! ****FEEL THE ENERGY!!!!!!MM-SMILEY FACE!
4,WAY above average remixes for this timeless saga.,"Exceptionally good remixes here! Should appeal to just about every DJ and music fan. Loved the 'Imperial attack' Drum Dub, even if it is a bit quick for my taste.(140 BPM) - Certain cities will eat this up! The Club mixes are fun and DJ friendly, as the Flip is sinister and biting. Ace engineering and mastering job on the 12"" (vinyl forever!!!!) Glad to see that Hex Hector and Hani agree!"
4,"""Imperial Drum Dub"" kicks butt! this track is BANGIN'","I'm not really a big Star Wars fan, but I'm a DJ and I heard about this record through a friend. I couln't find it in a record store so I tried Amazon. I was so happy to find it here. All the mixes are great. My favorite are the Dark club and Imperial mixes."
1,"lame, boring and a HUGE disappointment-don't waste your $$!","After reading the several ""glowing"" reviews for this remix cd - I ordered and eagerly waited for it- However what I heard on it was a HUGE disappointment - think ""Revenge of the Nerds does Devo"" - only much worse! This cd is insulting to Star Wars and John Williams. There is no excitement or energy, just boring elevator-type synthesizer music....maybe good for bedtime.....BUYER BEWARE!..Dezrock is a crock!"
2,TOO REPETITIVE,"The pieces are cool, because they're by John Williams, but you can get tired of it VERY quickly!"
3,It sounds like a video game!,"Very likely to the music that you might listen while playing a Nintendo video game. Too much Tecno for me. ANYHOW...i think it's a must buy. Would not do any harm to your collection if you buy it. For any further comments, email me."

1,A waist of my money !,"This book was overly detailed for so few pages. The Author jumped from one plot to the next.. NOT to mention the ending ruined the entire book for me... And to top it off, I find out that the author is WHITE..... Oh hell no...What a dissapointment..."
4,Excellent Tool,"I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it. My only suggestion is that it be in English alphabetical order instead of Latin. If I want to look up a word, it is hard if I have no idea what it is in Latin. But overall, it is a great tool to go with her curriculum. Thanks."
5,Very Helpful,This is an excellent reference guide and it has stood up just to a lot of heavy use in and out of class.
3,Useful but Unexceptional,"There is a lot of good data on this sheet. I teach (among other things) Latin at a prestigious Military Academy and College, and everyone uses this materal. I chose it over other sheets that provide the same type of data."
4,A fine introduction . . .,"This is an excellent book, primarily addressing practical and contemporary matters rather than lore and legend, and therefore well-adapted to explain the Asatru or Odinist folkway to a beginner or a curious investigator. It does not cover much of the mythology or esoteric practices of the religion, but I understand these will be addressed by later volumes."
5,Best basic Foundation Book for Asatru I have read in Years,I received this book on May 27 along with The Asatru Edda. This book is one of the best I have read for a basic foundation on Asatru. It cuts through the so-called Pagan reputation and Judeo-Christian misnomers ofOur Heathen Ancestral religion and gives an excellent introduction to those searching as well as those of us that hold Asatru/Odinism as our Tru Faith. HTR.
2,disc could be so much better if...,"Yes, there are nice songs on this CD. But several of them have the introduction cut off and song starts with singing part immediately. For those who knew the complete version it could be annoying. I just find it bizarre that professionally manufactured disc could not contain the full versions of the songs. It sounds like it's home made. Selection of the songs is great, though."
5,Saxon After Shave,"The Saxon After Shave smells just as wonderful as I remembered my husband wearing it 25 years ago...however, I puchased a bottle of 2.5 oz and it was only 1/2 full...with no explanation and no response to my email questioning this."
5,Saxon is excellent.,"Saxon is an excellent product. I have used it for many years. Shipping was prompt. Price is a little steep, but the product is good."
4,A terrific light read,"I too wasn't a big fan of Pullman's work for older readers, but this is really charming."
3,Not Pullman's best work,"Good enough tale for young'ens with morals aplenty. Just not at the level of the ""Dark Materials"" novels which entertain not only young people, but provoke thought in adults as well in a superb way."
2,new clues to harry potter book 5,"Puts the tic in fanatic. Some interesting insights, but not many, unless your interested in researching Assyrian theology or other obscure quests for clues. This is a good book if you have nothing else to do with your life but contemplate JKR's use of words or the frequency of various types of words. I did read some of it, but most of it was worthless since I don't have the time to read thier list of 40 or 50 novels inorder to find the clues to thier hints of clues. I did like Blacks family tree which shows how Ron and Malfoy are 3rd cousins once removed. Snape being a vampire seems pretty far fetched, but kind of interesting. Overall it has some entertainment value, just not much."
1,not so good,"really, if I had the time to research all the references and books the author mentions, I would write my own guide!! Not worth the effort unless you aspire to PhD in Philology..."
2,If I were an English lit scholar....,"I might have enjoyed this book. As it was, the hints were too vague and arch (as in mischievous, saucy) for the non- philologists. I have gotten clearer explanations of esoteric references in HP out of reading the boards on the various web sites. Speaking of the boards, here's a link that will take you to a discussion of Galadriel and WWF on The Sugar Quill.Galadiel Waters and her team have spent a great deal of time on this quest, but IMHO, the WWF books are for the Hermoines of the world who solve every problem by going to the library."
3,Misleading,"I got this book as a present and I figured it would help me understand the world of book five better, but I'm really not that kind of deep insightful person that can figure out the insightful hints and secret and concealed clues like that. If you are like that, then this is the book for you, if you aren't than get the full analysis when it comes out, like I will."
3,"Interesting, But Mostly a Tease for an Upcoming Book","While some of the ""hints"" are quite interesting, you shouldn't buy this book if you are looking for the conclusions made in The Plot Thickens... Harry Potter Investigated by Fans for Fans. The first 30 pages are a repetative explanation of the fact that this book is hints only. You are told several times how the next book will give possible explanations of the hints given in this one. While the ""hints"" given are interesting, those Griffindors of us are too busy to go through the multitudes of books listed as possible help in deciphering the ""hints."" I'll just have to wait for the next book to come out to see what conclusions can made from the hints in this one."
3,I thought this book was OK,"I think this book is OK. I liked the chapter analysis better,thought. Also, I think that running bits is going too far.It was kind of dumb how they thought that about every other wordwas a running bit. I did like their clues. I also liked the Snape: Vampire or Non-Vampire. This book is good, but I'm a young reader of it and could not possibly read books like Shakespear's A Winter's Tale and other huge books just to find a few related things. Anyways,this book was OK, but you might want to see what other people think about it before you buy it."
4,Just a little tease........,"Others have noted this book was never meant to be a substitute for Galadriel's actual Guide, just something to have fun with until the Guide for Book 5 comes out. This one is designed to help you learn how the authors figure stuff out and come up with their theories/predictions and how you can do it too. Some of the clues are easy, of course, but many will have you digging out the previous HP books, literature, and researching the internet for info about constellations, mythology, history, and just about everything else! If you're not looking for one book to lead you to read a bunch of others to figure out clues (actually, what a great concept!) wait for the regular Guide to Book 5, which I believe comes out this year sometime anyway. If you're up to the task, however, happy sleuthing!!!!!"
1,Not as expected...,"The book is just a ""for fun"" read. Some of the author's theories are really far-fetched and I could see no connection between some of the clues and why it was so important. For an example, why is it so important that the readers remember Dudley's best friend's name (Polkiss and Piers)? What does that have to do with clues to reveal book 6? Also the author really emphasizes that Neville has had a memory charm oh him! The exapmle they used did not make sense in my head and I saw no connection to it pointing to Neville's memory being modified. The running bits really confused me, I mean what does wheels and spindels have to do with the outcome of the book?I honestly think that if you are a person who is looking for help anaylzing the book, then this is NOT the book to buy."
5,Love this book!,This book is AWESOME! The information in this guide made re-reading the Harry Potter books a thousand times better the second time around. Can't say enough.... Mike
1,Poor.,"I am a true die hard fan, and i feel that this book lets people down. The first book giving clues about books 1-4, was so helpful. I was so glad that the same author was going to write about book 5. As there was no review available, i had to buy the book first to find out about. Not impressed at all. I know another book is coming out in November, will wait and see the reviews first before i waste more money!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Short and quick analsis. So so in my opinon,"I felt that this book did help in some way. The review of each chapter was very short and concise. It did not offer lengthy in depth analysis of each chapter. The information was general and filled with cute bits of information. The book has a funny way of its paper. Its frilled at the ends. I do not know why they did this. I was hoping for more information and more substantional information to read. Overall, I felt that this was a good book with limited information. I thought that the analysis on book 1-4 was much better and filled with more data. The price is not worth the book. I did like the cut out tab of the last page. The book is worth reading but only for short information to read."
5,"Holy Sleuthing, Batman, it's Harry Potter!!!!","A thoroughly enjoyable HP sleuth effort. I read the entire extant HP corpus 5 times last year (I AM NOT obsessed!) But this little gem made want to read OotP again. I missed many clues, apparently! This one goes into my permanent library for re-reading after the new HP 6 is read! WWP SCORES A PERFECT 10!"
1,Annoyingly Little REAL Information,"I was really disappointed in this book. While I realized it was advertised as a ""hints only"" book, I didn't realize how little they actually tell you. They refer you to many other books and literature which I do not have access to. And then leave you hanging. I also think the ""running bits"" parts are just going way too far! I think people are reading far too much into these books! I do LOVE the Harry Potter books with a passion, but this hint book was completely useless to me!"
3,What was the deal with the Running bits?,"Overall I enjoyed the book - I couldn't put it down. The FAQ's and hints were good and it was fun seeing things you never noticed before. That said... the running bits and some of the other overanalyzed material was annoying. According to the authors JKR had hidden meanings behind every other word she wrote. If this were the case it would have taken her 20 years to write the book.Another thing was that some very obvious things were pointed out as if they were very deep, which really made me wonder why some of the other ideas they had were totally beyond my realm of understanding.Anyway, for the most part it was good. Just ignore some of the more outlandish ideas."
3,An okay-rated Book,This book was okay but I found it rather annoying because I couldn't figure out any of the clues! Its full of hints but not good enough to figure them out! I wish they could give answers at the back or sumthing because I don't have the patience to spend my life looking for clues. Anyway if you don't mind spending a lot of time searching then I guess it's a good book but not if you want answers!-14
3,worth it for major fans,"First I just have to say one thing: *Galadriel* Waters and Astre *Mithrandir*? Is that for real? Anyways, it's worth it for those of us in desperate need of a Potter fix, but I wouldn't recommend it for casual fans. This leaves you to build your own theories and conclusions, but doesn't guide you through anything, persay. Definitly for the older, more serious fans."
1,Very Dissapointing,This book is not like the first. It basically rewords everything leaving a lot still in the dark. As the half blood prince comes out next month when will this be done. Hopefully book 7.Not recomending anyone to buy this.
1,Useless waste of pulp,"This book does nothing but pose a lot of questions (many of which are obvious) and suggest a lot of far-fetched theories. The book is a model of disorganization. The author states that she has written the book as a ""hints only"" guide to allow you to have fun figuring things out on your own. Well, do you really need a guide to do that? Doesn't that suggest that either this is a lazy attempt to capitalize on Rowling's success or that the author has no answers (or correct ones anyway)? Just read the books and think for yourself and you'll be a lot better off."
2,Not too well played,"These four violin concertos by Nardini leave a lot to be desired. I had high expectations when I ordered this however, after hearing them, I am quite disappointed. I find the concertos not too interesting and the violinist lacks finesse and polish. The violinist, Mauro Rossi tends to egg-shape many of the notes which is very distracting and this disturbs the musical line. Not being able to hear snippets before buying this CD, I thought the last concerto (A Major) was the very same concerto I have with Herman Krebbers playing however to my disappointment, it is a different concerto altogether. By the way, Mr. Krebbers plays much, much better. I think I'll squirrel this one away in a cabinet and forget about it!"
4,hidden gems,Boyd Rice collects some rare tunes on this collection. If you're into the girl group sounds of the 60's and want to dive in deep this is a pretty good collection. The Mastering is so-so but it sounds as if the source 45's these were pulled from were pretty rough already. The Honey Ltd songs are both wonderful.
2,Avoid if you understand the basics,This book would be great if you have no knowledge at all to with regards to anything dealing with research papers. However if what your looking for is something to help hone your writing skills to produce better research papers look elsewhere.Honestly this isn't a terrible book. It is all about relevancy. Again if you have no knowledge as to what a research paper is or how to organize and write one I would say go for it. If you have that basic understanding but want to improve and brings your B's and C's up to A's look elsewhere.
1,APA? Chicago? Couldn't find them,"I bought this book specifically because it says it has APA and Chicago formatting style and yet NO WHERE in the index do you find either style and looking through the book, it isn't there either. Waste of money."
5,One of the best!,"Sid the science kid is a must for young kids. My grandson starting watching it at age three and has picked up an amazing vocabulary and science concepts. I find it entertaining, too. Quick delivery, reliable seller."
1,Can't handle the work,"Glad they stopped making this. Second time I used it, the motor burned up. I threw it away...but don't do what I did! Keep the base and call/email cuisinart for some kind of replacement."
2,I really wanted to like this,"I'm a huge fan of all the period pieces that come out of the BBC. Sense and Sensibility, Jane Eyre, Tipping the Velvet, Bleak House, Emma, Fingersmith, etc. I can't remember a time that I was truly disappointed... until now.Maybe one reason is because this film is only 92 minutes long. The way it begins makes you feel like you've missed an hour. We're basically plunged into it. The story and character's were not fleshed out at all. I felt no connection with them or what was happening in their lives. I felt nothing for them at all. Well except for Anne. The character of Anne was very unlikable. She came across as very arrogant, cynical and forceful. I couldn't understand where she was coming from. She was a real turn off. Another reviewer states that it get's better but in all honesty, I couldn't sit through it. By the time a story begins to form, we're already half way done with the film. My concentration was pretty much gone by that point."
2,Fire the hostess,"The material was good, the hostess was TERRIBLE! Hard to believe someone hired her to be on camera. Save your $1.99."
2,Disappointed,"This sander sanded fine but there were two important things about this tool that disappointed me. First, I have two Shop Vacs and this sander would not attach to either of them. Second, the ability of the sander to collect dust was marginal at best. The boat yard where I was working had to ask me to quit using this sander because it was allowing too much dust to escape. I had higher expectations from Porter Cable."
2,Timothy t;he Tool Man,"It hurts my hands because of vibration. Also my wife says it's to loud and I should sell it at the garage sale.Not one I would recomend to anyone.I own 2 other brands that work a lot better and were cheaper to purchase,"
2,Puts up quite a fight for a little guy,"I received one of these sanders for Christmas when my PC 333VS finally died. I had the 333VS for about 10 years and loved it. I had to replace the little band a couple times, but that was quick and easy. So when I needed a new one, I went with the PC 343K.I used it a couple times, but the main problem I had with it was that I always felt that I was fighting it. It wanted to go where it wanted to go, and I had little say in the matter. It didn't matter what grit paper I was using or what type of wood I was sanding, it was a struggle to move it where I wanted. It also vibrated enough that my hand was tingling after using it for about 5 minutes. Sanding is arduous enough without having to do battle with the sander.I've since donated it to a military base woodworking shop and bought a DeWalt D26453K, and love it. It's a little dustier, but it runs smooth and does a great job."
3,NEW Dust Collection System - VERY POOR,"I've owned both Porter Cable & Dewalt orbital sanders and still own both. I have never liked this push on type of dust canister as they always blow off while sanding and dust goes everywhere.PORTER CABLE/DELTA - Go back to your old style, PLEASE!!!I've needed a couple of new sanders but refuse to buy these now because of the dust canister. I love the sanders...just hate the canister connections."
2,Not Impressed,"Having owned several PC products, this is one of the first in which I've been completely unimpressed.On the positive side, for an orbital sander, it's very aggressive in removing wood. Plus, compared with other sanders, it seems to effectively use the entire sanding disc, rether than just wearing out the edges. It also comes with a nice hard case.Unfortunately, the dust collection system is completely sub-standard. It's impossible to keep it firmly attached to a shop-vac. Amazingly, it doesn't even work well with a PORTER CABLE shop-vac. Additionally, unless you hold it on with your hand, the dust canister continually rattles off during use. Lastly, in the rare instance when you can get the canister to stay in place, dust blows out past the seals.I've come to expect much more from PC, even for a low-cost tool."
3,"Decent sander, bad dust collector","In my experience, which is probably not as extensive as others here who work on hundreds of cabinets a year, this is a decent sander that is powerful and controllable enough for common woodworking jobs around the house. I'm on my third piece of furniture now and it would have been painful without the P-C.However, like many of the others, I have to also report that the dust collector will no longer stay attached... Good thing I have duct tape."
2,Not great !!!! Porter Cable could do better.,I had there older model for years. In fact just wore it out I used it so much. So I had no question about what brand to replace it. But I was very disappointed with this. It is not balanced properly. Uncomfortable to the hand and doesn't sand as good as the older model. I think the leader today is Makita. Buy theirs and save yourself a lot of grief.
2,Mine broke after first use.,"I bought one of these at Lowes the other day. I used it for about an hour before I turned it off. When I tried to resume using it, it would not start. I tapped on it a few times with a hammer, and it started right up. The next day I took it back to Lowes and got a comparable DeWalt modelDEWALT D26451K 3 Amp 5-Inch Random Orbit Sander with Cloth Dust Bag.I think this is probably a good product and the issue with mine was a fluke. While it worked, it did a fine job. I decided to go with the DeWalt model because I gave PC their shot and for whatever reason, it failed.After using both, the DeWalt version is marginally better. If the PC model would not have failed on me, it would have gotten 4 or 5 stars."
5,Quality,"A quality tool ,a tad on the heavy side but at $59.00 and no shipping charge i can live with it."
4,PORTER CABLE 343K ORBITAL SANDER,"THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS SANDER IS THE VACUUM HOOK-UP DOESN'T ACCEPT THE 1 1/4"" HOSE SECURLY"
4,"So far, so good","I have only used the sander for about a month on several occasions but it appears to work well. My only complaint is the inadequacy of the dust collection attachment. It captures some of the dust but the fines are airborne and will cover the surrounding work area. Overall, I would recommend this random orbit sander"
4,Good Machine,He have own this machine for almost a year and a half it performs very well its sturdy and ergonomic we own another sander i dont know if happends with all the other sanders but the dust collector broke out i think it's a matter of time to happen in all the other sanders.
3,"Wanted to like it, but...","I'm partial to Porter-Cable products, and had high hopes for this sander. It replaces a Dewalt RO sander. I chose the P-C because I liked the dust collection arrangement and the ability to connect easily to a vacuum hose. Unlike some of the other reviewers I had no problem making a firm connection, but that may be because of the hose I used. And I also like the action - the sanding job is quick and smooth. What I don't like, and it could just be that I've got a lemon, is that the unit vibrates far more than my DeWalt did. Sanding for more than 5 minutes tires my hand out with intense high-frequency vibration. Despite the other appealing aspects of the sander, this vibration problem would send me back to the DeWalt."
1,"5""PorterCable random orbit sander","Anyone interested in buying a random orbit sander should read your one star reviews on this product. I did just to see if anyone else had the same troubles. My dust collector fell off almost from day one so I attached it using self-tapping sheet metal screws. I don't check it often because it rarely collects anything anyway. I only use it outdoors now in a breeeze. I am online now trying to buy a new hook and loop pad. It does sand nicely, but I wish I had never seen it."
3,Can be a pain!,"I own several Porter Cable tools, and this one leaves me wondering who did the R&D.; Its not as comfortable to use as previous models. On the bright side, the dust collector is easy to empty..actually it never gets much in it as it always falls off and blows clouds of dust in your face!If you like the look of duct tape on your new tools... go for it.I do hope someone at PC looks at these reviews for feed back."
4,Urban D. brings back what's been missin' from hip hop...,"Urban D.'s album calls for accountability. One of the tracks which sticks out in my mind is Substance and Content. The listener will definitely think more carefully about what he or she listens to after hearing this song. We are also introduced to 813 Familia, a collaboration of brothers in christ who wish to spread his message. Tight tracks and appearances by Sup, Dirt, and Goldenchild make this a must-have for any person seeking the missin' element. Much love goes out to all the other TruHipHop groups about to blow up; DNA, Remnant Militia, Walking Dead, 1Way, Ill Harmonics, Mass Reality, and on and on... Keepin' it Jesus, Chief"
1,not happy at all,"This basket even with the description is bogus all items were purchased from a dollar store except for marinade sausage and basket this is a 25,30 dollar basket at most. Quality and quantity suck very upset with this purchase.off brand materials are used to complete this do not buy....did I mention I hate this it was a gift for someone I feel like money was wasted and it cost to much to send back."
4,Worked great on my BMW f650 dakar,Bought this to put on a 2003 dakar and was no problem to install. This is a good solid fender that I hope to get years of service out of. This fender was made in Italy and shipped to US then to me in a plastic bag so with all the shipping and moving the finish on the fender had a fair amount of scratches. Would have liked to have a perfect fender to install.
3,babbitt always knows best,"Bruce Babbitt continues to labor under the self deception that he know best in determining the future of the ""common people"" his ideas always consume like serfs found to be useless in the feifdom. Read it for the future it suggests of an end to private property and a beginning of the sort of Stalinism and federal tyranny that Babbitt favors. Don't think it was written by any true westerner who ""grew up on a ranch."" It was written by a political lackey and opportunist who was kicked off his grandfather's spread in Arizona and has always yearned for power--especially power over what he calls the ""agricultural apparatchiks."""
5,Authentic Instrumentation by Leading North Indian Artists,"""Festival of India, a Hindustani Sampler"" combines both folk and classical Hindustani music performed by leading North Indian artists in different stages of their individual careers. A variety of native Indian instruments are used. Musical artists include Sultan Khan, V.G. Jog, G.S. Sachdev, Purna Das Baul, and the Dagar Brothers. This album offers a rich, authentic and varied sampling of traditional music of North Indian heritage."
2,Boring and lackluster.,"For some reason I seem to have a different set of standards for one of these novels than others. The novels plot is so slow that I've fallen asleep while reading it (in broad daylight!) And this part if a trilogy? Lord! The author regularly has Dinah mention that an encounter with Cordell ought to be memorable and just so ""hot"" yet when we finally get there, it's a huge letdown. I feel almost cheated. You would hope that the plot could save this book, but even the plot is amazingly dull - Dinah is suffering from PTSD and needs help getting over it. This isn't't what made it boring, it is the abrupt way in which this is handled. I can determine I will not be purchasing anything by this author in the future."
4,The backup plan,The backup planLives up to expectations of a good read from Sheryl woodsAnd why do you require a certain number of words Ok
3,The Backup Plan,"There is no denying that Dinah Davis has been very successful as a foreign correspondent reporting from the war zones of the world. However, when she is involved in a horrific accident in Afghanistan, she leaves work and comes home to Charleston where she is left with nothing but her back up plan....to rekindle a relationship with Bobby Beaufort whom she left ten years ago.Once Dinah returns home, she discovers that not everything has remained the same. Bobby is engaged and Dinah finds a sudden interest is his bad boy brother Cordell who infuriates and intrigues her all at once.I actually enjoyed this book more than I thought I would, expecting a typical romance with little plot. What I got was a story with well developed characters and the plot of a woman dealing with post traumatic stress disorder...as well as a love story. A good read; I plan on reading more of Sherryl Woods in the future."
4,A Fun Fluffy Read,"This was a fun, fluffy read - romance genre. The main character is a war correspondent who comes home after her life falls apart. She's got a backup plan man at home - but is that what she really wants? Will her plan be derailed? A nice summer diversion of a read."
3,Nice Refresher,"this is a nice refresher for a high school class. However if you want to truly get the concepts and learn how to prove a formula, this book isn't for you."
5,Better than Valium . . .,"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Precalculus is an excellent book for readers who want to venture into the Land of Calculus, but fear they have neither the skill nor the ""mathematical mind"" to do so. At the end of this journey, you'll feel calm, confident and ready to do battle with ""The Calculus."" Highly recommended to math-phobes everywhere!"
4,Precalculus,A very good book for learning the basics of precalculus with clear explanations. It was full of clear examples of almost all the topics in a precalculus course. Some sections could have used additional example problems but overall the book covered precalculus well.
4,Great help..but moves fast,"I purchased this book to study over the summer before taking precal in the fall. So far so good, but my algebra skills are very weak, so I find I have to review previous chapters or refer back to them once I start the next chapters. I like the practice problems, and ""final"" at the end, the author does really try to explain concepts as througly as possible but I think it will be a great reference once the class starts in the fall, I would recommed this to a friend."
4,Decent,"Not bad works quite well for a small piece of lexan, great for dry erase markers, not much else to say"
5,Great TV from a Solid Company,"My 32"" Sony went out after 10 years and i was on the hunt for a new TV. It had been many years since searching for a television and they have come a long way. Although i had been happy with my sony and was looking at sony tubes the big screens caught my eye. I looked at the Mitsubishi, Sony, Akai, Toshiba, Phillips. I did think the Mits and Sony had the best picture quality for a rear projection and was just about to purchase a 65"" Mits for 2,499$ when my wifed noticed a green tag laying next to the Phillips and it was for 1,499$ for the 60"". After further help at the store with all the features and hooking up a DVD player to view the picture and an HD box to check out the HD view I was sold. For the price nothing could touch it in quality and size and have been very pleased with the picture quality and sound quality. At my price point im must say im overall pleased but wouldnt we all want the 61"" Plasma, dang i dont have 20,000$ to burn, LOL....."
5,An Excellent HD TV,"We bought this HD Tv in March and couldn't be happier with it. We've now added HD cable to the house! The sports programs we've watched have been amazing. The picture quality is excellent. The only problem is with the remote for where Philips put the ""AV"" switch - under this concealed area that's a pain to open at times. Other than that, we'd buy this tv again in an instant. We bought it at $1800 with no delivery and no sales tax. After more research, we could not find a better deal anywhere - internet or local stores."
3,.,"I would love to give this tv a five. I am no expert but it is very nice. my father has a 61"" sony and this one has a way better picture. my problem is that it arrived with a crack in the screen and i have written two emails to amazon and have not received a response. the tv ""in general"" is a good bargin. if my problem ever gets fixed I would defiently recommend it to anyone."
2,Doesn't work very well,"I tried these tools for dipping chocolates and they don't work very well The oval loop is large enough that truffles tend to get stuck. The Ateco stainelss tools work much better. They might work for dipping fruit, but most fruit is easier to just dip by hand."
2,Light reading,"This book takes you through the different regions of Portugal, their places of interest, food, life style and types of property. It does so in an easy-to-read, chatty way. The author travels with her husband. 'My husband and I' are often mentioned. They do a three-week train journey in northern Portugal and are invited to the Portwine Institute in Lisbon. The personal touch extends to socialising with the locals and expats.How to go about buying property is explained, but advice can be a bit basic. Some is just common sense, like to find your property you look for it in local newspapers or the Sunday Times property supplement for places abroad. There are vocabulary lists with Portuguese words. On page 87 there is an overview of the purchasing process. This is useful, but it can also be found in other books. The thing is that we are spoilt for choice with so many books coming out on buying property and living in Portugal, some very good indeed."
2,"Catchy title, good cover, not enough","The saying that you must never choose a book by its cover is entirely applicable in this case. For an insider guide, as claimed on the cover, this book is too superficial. It does not come to grips with the key issues of buying your property. The summaries at the end of each chapter are a good measure of the poor level of information. In the chapter on the Purchasing Process the summary has nothing more substantial to say than it is a good idea to give Power of Attorney to a Portuguese lawyer if you are buying from the UK.An annoying characteristic in this book is that common place statements are delivered with great solemnity. What the book lacks in useful information it exceeds in platitudes.I fell for the title and the cover. It served me right. I had to spend more money getting another book. I am pleased I have now found a couple of excellent books on buying property in Portugal. I hope my experience can help others."
2,They arrived all crumbled.,They taste all right so I converted them into bread crumbs. I guess it's just one of those products that doesn't ship well.
3,OK trivia book covering most well-known horror series,"This book has sections on the following series: Alien; The Amityville Horror; Child's Play; The Evil Dead; The Exorcist; The Fly; Friday the 13th; Halloween; Hannibal Lecter; House; The Howling; Night of the Living Dead; A Nightmare on Elm Street; The Omen; Poltergeist; Prom Night; Psycho; The Return of the Living Dead; Silent Night, Deadly Night; The Stepfather; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

5,Excellent Performance,"I am an active storm chaser and use this router with my Kyocera 1xEVDO Passport card with U S Cellular. We have been able to share the internet between several laptops in our storm van, going up and down the highways and backroads of Iowa. Have used this Dlink router and setup for two years without any problems. Have used both the wireless and hardwired (ethernet) setup. Have been very pleased!"
1,Another defective unit,"The DIR-450 seemed to work at first, but within 1 hour it went into power reset/cycling over and over. Hard reset, power off/on, nothing worked. D-Link tech support worked with me for 25 minutes and gave up. He said the unit appeared to be defective and told me to return it to the store (Fry's).From the other postings, a DOA unit seems to be way too common. I am looking for a different manufacturer now."
5,Great book,this is a great book. I enjoyed reading every part of it. very spiritual if you're looking for that kind of reading. The meditation excercises are excellent!
4,"Very motivational, positive music.",This CD is a unique blend of R&B and positive messages rolled up into one.
3,full spectrum of writings and translation,"The content in the original French ranges from the beautiful ""On ne meurt jamais"" to the confusing ""Le personnage"" Some works are interesting but others seem tedious. The collection presents to the reader a wide range of contemporary French literature and, if one is a student, an excellent opportunity to see the French language used in all its various applications. The editor takes the liberty of translating the sense of idiomatic phrases rather than attempting to force the words into something that resembles the original, with mixed results. The longest piece, 'David' is also one of the best, as is 'L'objet d'art'; my favorite 'On ne meurt jamais' made the purchase worthwhile all by itself."
2,Useless on a Kindle,"Excellent in hard copy but not very useful on a Kindle because the translations are completely separated. They are therefore very difficult to flip back and forth to, from one translation to the other."
1,disappointing,"I am not familiar with most of the authors, and a quick review of the stories shows me why. I should have paid more attention to the other reviews. I was hoping to use this to teach a class in French short stories, but instead it goes directly into the library donation pile."
4,in my own words,"Well we've been using the product for a few weeks now and it seems to be working quite swell, no complaints"
3,At least the dogs like them,"Not reaslly sure if these work or not, but my dogs do love the flavor. A little disappointed you have to give one per day as I thought it was one per month. But they still itch and scratch not sure if fleas or alergy."
1,repellant flea product,"I tried this thinking it was a good idea, and it did not help what so ever. I will never get these again, they do not work."
2,The Dog & Cats are still scratchin',"I was really disappointed with this product. We live in an area of Louisiana that is infested with fleas. When I got the opportunity to try a product that was not harmful to my pets and affordably priced I decided to try it. There was only small change in the level of fleas that were on the dog or cats. This included treating the yard, bombing the house and treating the animals. Save your money on this one, it does not work."
3,Didn't really work for us.,"This product didn't really work for us, all of animals continued to scratch and have fleas on them throughout usage. Later on we heard, from where I cannot remember, that some of the ingredients weren't good for dogs, so we decided to stop using it."
2,"""No Chemicals"" is a noble thought, but it does NOT work on fleas","We all love our pets and we want them to be healthy, happy and ideally chemical-free. That is the reason why I gave this product a shot. No fleas and no chemicals sounds great and believe me, I wish this product had worked.I had to go back to 'Program' and 'Capstar.'"
1,Does not work as stated!,"While this may be a vitamin supplement, it does not repel fleas at all. Used one whole bottle, 100 days worth, and saw no visible improvement in my dogs' coat. She ate the tablets like a treat, which tells me there may be more flavoring type ingredients than actual vitamins/supplements. Will not buy again or recommend to anyone."
2,good for fur bad for keping fleas off,the product did make my pets fur softer but did nothing as far as a flea repellent.
1,Save your money!!,"Used this product for 3 months but my dog now has the worst case of fleas ever, it's back to Frontline. Check out 'Flea Away' website, a single lonely testimonial to product efficacy... that should tell you something."
3,ok,this product is ok my dogs still have fleas and so like I said its ok I cant believe its not great
3,flea away chewable tabs,"I was hoping that this product would work for my dog, it does have nutritional supplements but the flea part did't work for my 11 yr old puppy, she needed perscription medication to cure her flea issue, the dog never had fleas and one day after 11 yrs she got them, I tried dips at home and at the pet grommers and it really didn't work after a few days.So a perscription was the only way to really go with."
2,Did not work,This product did not get rid of the fleas. I have gone through the whole bottle and there just isn't a change
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing......Flea Away did not keep the flea's away as was advertised! Don't purchase, caused my dog to have itchy skin."
2,Can't sleep? Play this game.,"I bought this game for my kids to play, and after they bored of it after 30 minutes, I decided I would give it a try. Well, save your money and go buy a grande Starbucks coffee, at least that way you can stay awake. The ""action"" is boring and the gameplay is very lame. Not recommeneded."
2,Alterate time-line for the Marvel mob,"Niel Gaiman has created some amazing illustrated fiction, the kind that combines literate storytelling with masterful artwork. I regret that 1602 is not part of that ouvre.If you're a dedicated fan of the X-Men, Nick Fury, Drs. Strange and Doom, the Fantastic Four, and Marvel's other standards, you may well enjoy seeing them all transplanted into the early seventeenth century. I'm afraid that I outgrew my interest in those characters some time back. For me, this looked less like an exploration of the comic medium and more like a mechanical attempt to inject novelty into franchises that desperately need it.If the usual Marvel crowd holds your attention, then go ahead, enjoy. You'll probably find a lot to like here. My interests have moved on.//wiredweird"
2,Beautiful Deception,"What begins as a beautifully illustrated, intriguing and well written story becomes a cheap and unintelligent political statement. Neil Gaiman is one of the most talented writers in modern day comics, it is sad that some one of such talent feels the need to take such potshots. The work is worth having for the art, but the potential of the story dies about halfway through."
3,Inventive recontextualization of classic Marvel heroes and villains,"I rarely keep up with comic books and graphic novels these days, so I know very little of Gaiman's work with the Sandman series. That said, I think this reinvention of some classic Marvel heroes is strong on creativity and short on a coherent storyline. In this collected series of 8 comic books, Gaiman tells of an Elizabethan England that is threatened both by Count Otto Von Doom's Latveria and by the religiously motivated machinations of James of Scotland, heir to the throne. Familiar characters like Dr. Strange, the Fantastic Four, and Thor show up in altogether unfamiliar places and contexts. Many of the details are thoroughly enjoyable (e.g., Gaiman touches on the spiritual consequences for the Christian who turns into the Norse god Thor), but there are an equal number of plot threads and loose ends that go nowhere."
3,7/8 of this is amazing,"I reluctantly give it three stars. I have never seen something that seems to be as well done as this flop so badly in the end. I found the end to be heavy handed, forced, implausible and not alluded to at all.The first 7 issues of it deserve 5 stars each though. Gaiman brilliantly interprets so many Marvel classics for the Elizabethan era.If you really want optimal reading pleasure then stop at the end of issue 7."
1,I dont get it,The good news is I didnt buy this book but signed it out of the Library. This gets very good ratings but I found it to be god awful.The animation was good but the story bounces around and doesnt make any sense at all.I guess its a novel idea to insert Marvel characters into another time zone but the story just rambles along in a confused fashion. I didnt get it-didnt like it. I have never given any book a one star before. Maybe if you are 13 it would make better sense
3,"Great artwork, not so great story","I particularly like and enjoy the artwork of this comic. Marvel 1602 has been created based on an interesting idea supported with great art work execution. The idea is creative by mixing all the well known Marvel characters into one story with a bit of time twist. However I find that the overall story can be better. I don't like how it flows and not really enjoying the ending. Somehow it failed to make use of the great opening that this comic already has.Value for money? I would still say yes. Eventhough the story is not that good, this comic is still worth for collection. There are not many comic like this out there."
3,"3 stars for ""No Noise...""","Beautiful package with great liner notes. Beware however that these Cd's were remastered using the ""No Noise"" technology. This results in a significant loss in musical information (most noticably in the vocals). 5 star music, but 3 stars for ""No Noise."
4,Milan Collection Caryall Tote Black,"This is a large bag that I purchased to carry my hair products and tools in. I am pleased with the purchase. The package came on time, and there was no issues."
5,High quality for a great price,"After looking through the offerings on Amazon, we chose these cat food can lids. We were a little bit worried because of how cheap they were, but decided to try them anyway. What a nice surprise they are! They're made of a thick, rubbery plastic that has a good amount of flexibility. They're a bit different from the grocery store variety since they fit better, so you actually have to learn how to use them. Instead of hooking them on one edge of the can and then pressing the other side down over the other edge, you just place these flat on the can and press the center and they snap nicely into place. I'll definitely be buying these again and would recommend them to anyone who needs pet food can covers."
4,Cat food can tops,"Fits a big size cat food can tightly. Since my cat doesn't eat a big can all at once, these are helpful."
2,Doesn't fit.,My fault I guess but the tops are too big for my dog food cans. And they took over 2 weeks to get. Should have gone to Walmart or pet store to buy them. Would have been much faster.
4,Multi-uses..,"I use them to keep my canned creamer fresh.. any canned foods that I don't finish ready for the next meal and of course dawg's (that's my cat) meals ready throughout the day.. Will fit most any tin (except individual portions) but then who would save anything from an individual can of spaghetti-o's??. Not a flimsy plastic, this.. Easy clean-up as well."
1,Not even worth it if they were FREE!,"Cheaply made, cracks easily and after a week I am throwing out! If I could have given this less than one star I would have. DO NOT waste your money!"
5,Great product,These simple lids cost more at the store and don't seem to last as long. A Great product at a great price.
4,Holy Cat Food Lids Batman!,"These lids are awesome! They fit great and so far seem very durable. I was so tired of buying can lids from my local pet stores (who shall remain nameless you know who you are you vileness corporations you! MUAWHAHA!).Seriously though, all the other lids I've tried seem to break or crack fairly easily. Sometimes they crack in the dishwasher and others break just by trying to get them on the can. Very frustrating, but look no further these are your pet food can lids SALVATION!"
5,Such a savior!,Where was I before? I just don't understand how I would miss this amazing product! I have been putting opened cans in ziplogs to save the food. But with this thing my suffering is over! I am so happy I found these. And the teal color is my favorite.
3,Not for small cans,"I mostly use the 3 oz cans of cat food and this product's description said it fits on almost any size can. These are way too big for the small cans but perfect for the 5 to 6 oz cans. Was disappointed, but will use for my few larger cans on which they work just fine. Just beware, THESE ARE NOT FOR THE SMALL CANS."
2,"OK if you have a pet named ""Spot""","These lids are made more cheaply than the nice set I got at the dollar store. the dollar store set also has cute raised paw designs on them. When the store ran out of them I bought 2 of these sets at Amazon, and I don't like them. They all have ""Spot"" written in raised letters on them. I have a cat - not named Spot. They also costed me more than 3 times the price of the ones at the dollar store.These fit only the 5.5 oz. cans of cat food, not the 3 oz. cans. I don't know about dog food cans."
4,Good Quality,These feel sturdy and well made. I don't put them in the dishwasher though because I don't want them to shrink or get deformed.
4,Very good lids,"They sell these in my local supermarket. Great price, good quality lids which last a decent amount of time - I typically get 2 to 3 years out of them at least. They are the softer plastic, i.e. not as soft or as long lasting as the rubber-type plastic but much better than the harder plastic lids. I removed one star because they only come in the colors shown and they don't come in a size small enough for the 3 oz. cans."
2,Warps in dishwasher,These lids fit cat food cans beautifully but after 2 runs through the dishwasher they are too warped to use anymore :(
5,"works great, fits perfectly",fits out large cans of dog food tightly and seals perfectly. highly recommended to keep opened can food fresh for longer.
5,great product!,Very convenient item. I love that it keeps the food fresh in the refridgerator. The colors are very cute too.
3,OK,"These tops are ok, not great. The plastic is sturdy, but looks like the stuff that cracks after a time. I bought two of the rubber lids...and they are easier to use."
3,Wasn't what I expected,"Although they can be used for standard 15oz cans, most of the canned food we have for our pets are smaller than the caps."
3,Pet food can covers,"Reasonably priced, but the fit is rather tight, really have to press down hard to make them fit but then they do. Can overlook that because they were rather cheap."
5,Fit great!,"I have had a hard time finding lids that fit my dog food cans properly and held up over time. (I buy the large Pedigree canned dogfood - not the small.) These lids are flexible, fit wonderfully (unlike others I have tried) and seem to hold up well after being washed in the dishwasher! Time will tell, but so far I am really pleased with these."
5,Works great!,"I love these! They work exactly as they're supposed to, and will fit two sizes of cans - the short ones like the ones cat food come in, and bigger ones, like the 13 ounce ones we get our dog food in. I couldn't find these anywhere in stores!"
3,Pretty but not so good for my cat,"I bought this litter pan when I got my first kitty. It's a pretty shade of lilac and I thought it would go well with my female cat. She used it but after a while she started to not go up the ramp and into the litter area. Day by day she would ""do her business"" on the ramp and further and further towards the opening. After a few weeks she wasn't even in the box anymore!It might just be my cat but I thought I'd put that out there.Other than that, the dome itself is rather nice. The clips don't securely hold the lid to the bottom so you can't really pick it up that way. Also, the liners aren't worth using. When the cats actually went into the litter area, they would scratch and rip right through the liner so it served no purpose."
4,"Exhaustive Study, Exhausting Read","Leverich gives us a comprehensive look at Tom Williams before he became the legendary playwright Tennessee Williams. It was not a pretty picture, but it seemed to be well documented and accurate. Leverich's writing is hard to get through because he places the same emphasis on each fact, and they should be weighted differently. How important is it to read several times about his fear of becoming like his mentally ill sister? Quite. Now how important is it to hear that he wrote home for money at least thirty times during the course of this book? Wouldn't it make more sense to have said that throughout his lean years, there were constant pleas for funds from his mother and grandparents, than to go into detail about each one?A good editor was sorely in need.On a positive note, Leverich treated Williams with respect, but never let his admiration minimize his shortcomings."
5,"""Tom"" is a must-read for Tenn fans!","I've read them all, everything from his highly ""colored"" memoirs to Dotson Rader's companion-book (literally). ""Tom"" is both a scholarly and exhaustive work that blows away the veils of mystery and hyperbole and just, plain apocraphy surrounding Thomas Lanier Williams, the man. I highly recommend this book for T. Williams fans, for it is not only a history of the man but an artistic history of his progress toward the pinacle of his success in the theatre, the days of his wine and roses and menageries and streetcars. Mr. Leverich parallels the grow in Mr. William's theatre as well as personal ""self"". And when I get the cash, I'm a gonna buy me a copy, but for now, I just read it in the library! Read it. Enjoy it. Keep it forever."
5,Tennessee William Bio,"This book is a new book, never used. And what an interesting book it is.Williams is a very interesting man and the book gives many details of hispersonal life....excellent reading"
1,not happy,"Item arrived today, perfume box was old (i know this is an old product but I guess I expected it to be sitting around untouched) I have perfume and box from more then 15 yrs ago in perfect condition. Perfume looked old too, it was dried up in the cap and left it discolored, the cap as also stuck on the bottle because of this, when u got the cap off it pulled the paint off the neck of the perfume. Spraying this reveals why u should never buy old perfume. Its kinda rancid. worst part is Amazon wont let u return flammable liquids so I am stuck with this junk and wasted my money. Thanks amazon."
3,Good book but narrow scope,"This is a great book if you just want to build a frequency synthesizer for RF Kind of applications. However, it doesn't do much else.For instance, the author doesn't do a good job on frequency dividers, which could be a big chapter by itself. Likewise not much emphasis on different ways to do oscillators, theory behind it etc. etc.I use it because it gives a good reference on the mathematical equations for phase margin, Xover frequency etc.My background: I have 15yr experience doing analog IC design."
5,"yep, It's as good as everyone says:","This one rocks. Here's why: I don't own many music dvd's but I had to get this one. Aside from being great musicians, these guys are BRILLIANT showmen. There aren't many bands out there these days who put as much into their shows as these guys. Their concert is more of an experience rather than just seeing some band jam. I would really love to see them in person. Oh yeah, they sound just as good (if not better) live as they do in the studio. If you get a chance, pick up the cd. It will not dissapoint. There are some pretty good features on the DVD. All in all, a great buy."
5,Just to let you know,"I just want to let you know that Rammstein created an English version of Du Hast for the United States with the name ""You Hate"" I fluently speak German and 'Hate' In German is spelled hasst. The song is spelled hast. The correct translation for the song is 'You Have', so whoever wrote the review on this dvd is stupid to talk about Rammstein making kids do crap, if all you critics got what you wanted, we'd have some pretty lame ass bands.."
5,Great!!,"After seeing Rammstein this summer I was hooked and excited about the video and it lived up to my expectations. They are so great!! They give a great show for 100,000 people or 2,000 people like when I saw them. I am in awe of them. They are a complete package band."
1,"Dissapointed, DVD-9 not compatable in US","My sister is a big fan of rammstein and has had trouble trying to locate this dvd, I found it here at amazon, where I've found many items that are hard to find, however this DVD is made in germany and is a high tech DVD-9 which does not play on the DVD players here in the US. I had to return it and hope that they come out with a US version soon."
5,One Amazing Concert,"Rammstein never stops amazing me with their aweome videos and even better music. When I got this DVD i went crazy over how awesome it is. The pyrotechnics rock, the music is better than a studio recording, and it is, overall, an amazing experience. Not to mention the interview, still concert images, and the SECRET MUSIC VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Simply the best,I love Rammstein music.This DVD blew my mind the first time I played it on my DVD player.I cant say anything else.This brilliant DVD has the most powerful sound I've never heard.It's like being on a live show.perfect image quality with the best 5.1 sound of the marketIt's a must.Go for it
3,Almost as good live!,If you have ever seen RAMMSTEIN live you know that it is the ultimate rock experience. But if you havn't seen them live this movie is as close as you can get to the real thing. RAMMSTEIN RULES!
3,WHY,"This dvd is a great buy and is a good rammstien live dvd. but why in earth would they take ou buck dich, one of the best parts of the eniter concert on the dvd and leave on a VHS it makes no snice and is inferating,theres no where to get it on dvd why destroy a great dvd by chopping it"
4,Misconception?,FYI- Du Hast does not mean you hate. Du HASST means you hate. This song is actually about marriage- not about hate. Mass media can confuse those not familiar with the german language.
3,3 1/2 STARS - WORTH THE MONEY,"This video is pretty well put together - the camera angles most of the time are in the right place, and the sound is absolutely awesome! My Problem with this DVD though is the energy, or lack of it from the band - For about 95% of the concert the members of the band just stand in one place and play their instruments with very little emotion, and thus the crowd is very boring too. There is very little dancing, headbanging and moshing. But on the upside, the interview is pretty cool and the beats and rythm of the songs are very powerful. This one is pretty well worth your money."
5,incredible. inhuman,Bikram Ghosh's drumming is the most intricate & complex I've ever heard. He's a tabla player of absolute mastery.
3,GOOD FILM,"OBVIOUSLY, THESE PEOPLE HAVE RIPPED OFF THE THEATRICAL RELEASE OF 'BATTLESHIP' STARRING RHIANNA BECAUSE THEY MADE THEIR OWN VERSION OF IT. THE STORYLINE IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EXCEPT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. BUT THE THEATRICAL VERSION IS BETTER."
2,American Rattletrap Ships,"Not all at similar to ""Battleship"" Hasbros Production. The Movie is less than B rated, the Ships looked phony or bad, the acting was really put on and terrible, The Navy Seals in this were not like the real Navy Seals, the ""Martians"" were like real bad puppets, the plot left a whole lot to be desired and not even 1/10th as cool as ""Battleship"". Yep I bought it even after reading some bad reviews and they were right on the money as far as the critical ones went. If you have seen both ""American Warships"" and ""Battleship"" then ""Battleship"" has to have been superior."
3,American Warships,This isn't too terrible of a movie. The graphics were not too bad. There were a lot of old cliches in the movie though. Overall not too bad.I did record this movie on SyFy channel Saturday night.
2,Tracfone Nokia 1100,"Pros: Sounds goodAlarm clockFlashlight is very useful, though not awfully bright.Good calculatorOK gamesLong battery life (so long as its not restarting constantly!)OK signal, though does drop calls in the mall occasionallyCons:Horrible customer serviceTends to restart, and when it does it will for several hours, even while charging.Randomly turns offCrappy ringtonesOverall: Some nice features, pretty basic and very unreliable."
2,Shipping fiasco,"Love the Riedel glasses and had ordered them in the past from Amazon. Unfortunately, the Amazon shipping department seems to have difficulty packing delicate items: The first shipment included a couple of heavy books which shifted during mailing and broke the glasses. The replacement box had the glasses jammed against one corner with air packing around three sides. Those arrived broken, also. Guess we'll purchase the glasses at a wine shop! Love Amazon and this is the first time we've had a shipping problem with you!"
3,Good Wine Glasses,I think most people buy Riedel glasses because they are Riedel glasses. They are a fine wine glass and because of the name make nice gifts but don't count on them making your wine drinking experience any better like they claim.
2,"read Professor Sherwood's - "" Vindication - a Novel""","In my opinion a better conceptualization Of Mary Wollstonecraft'sLife, Ideas, and Experinences is author: Frances SherwoodTile: Vindication.However the Gordon book is an adequate read"
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this pan in March 2007. I paid $110 because I wanted a pan that I would be able to use for several years. At first it worked well in terms of food not sticking, but after just two years the coating started to peel and everything started to stick. I never washed it in the dishwasher or used metal utensils with it. Calphalon has agreed to replace it if I send it back, but that still involves the hassle and cost of shipping it in addition to what I paid for it. On the other hand, I have a small Cuisinart anodized non-stick saucier that I have used even more than this one. I got it free along with a food processor I bought. That is truly a non-stick pan that is still is great shape after almost ten years of use. Next time I'll buy that one."
4,Great omelet pan,"Had our first one of these for 5-6 years. The non-stick has a few marks in it, but still works great - and is perfect for a one person omelet. So when we went online to buy a second one and it appeared that the pan is no longer being made, we bought 2!"
4,Christmas present,"gave to my husband who asked for it. what more can i say, it was a gift for christmas, ok"
5,ELVIS TREASURES,"ELVIS TREASURESThis book is a must for every Elvis fan,, the little extras are fasinating,and very informative,, you love Elvis?? You will definately love this book!! From beginning to end it is great!! received this book from Amazon,, the service is great,, an added plus."
4,Review of Hanes T-shirts,"Exactly HOW is one to review T-shirts? They were white as advertised and they were cotton also as advertised. I would love to say that wearing the right undershirts will improve your financial life, but would that not be a lie? I wish we were not asked to review every item we buy from or through Amazon. Most things are just OK, they are not excellent or very good or whatever."
4,Larger than expected,"These t-shirts are pretty good, however I was surprised at the size. I ordered the large and should probably have ordered medium instead. The shirts are larger than my existing large undershirts (Fruit of the Loom). That being said, they still fit fine as an undershirt and are comfortable."
4,Just a little bigger than I expected.,"I'm content with what I received from Hanes, except for the fact that medium sized shirts were rather loose fitting on me, and I'm not a skinny customer. Apart from that the shirts look and feel great,and I plan to get some more."
1,Shoddily Produced,"All 5 Undershirts that I received were misshapen (had uneven shaped neck holes). One side of the the neck appeared to be longer than the other. Under a dress shirt it is fine, but it is quite noticeable when not wearing one. I won't buy from hanes again"
3,Hanes Comfort Soft,"There was no indication that these t-shirts were Hanes Comfort soft. Therefore, the material was not what I expected. They are very thin not like the real Hanes T-shirt that I am accustomed buying."
1,Too big!!!,I ordered the small size and they are way huge! I even washed them and they are Huge! Bigger than they used to be.
3,Baggier and Looser than typical t-shirts,"If you're used to wearing fitted american apparel t shirts, I strongly advise you to get this shirt one size smaller. This item is baggy and loose. Other than that, it's what you'd expect: a thin and light undershirt."
2,THIN,Flimsy and thin. I don't think it will hold up in the wash. I'm going back to Fruit of the Loom.
3,"Don't Go is Hilarious, if not completely accurate","If anyone would know about the accuracy of ""Don't Go: Europe"", it would be an original ""Ugly American"" as the author himself would put it. Having lived in Europe for three years as a child of the military, and after travelling through several of the suggested areas, I would call Europe much more breathtaking than ""Don't Go"" makes it out to be.Paris, which ""Don't Go"" makes out to be the worst place on earth, was probably one of the bst places I went, and Heidelberg, which is only momentarlity mentioned in the book, has kept a wonderful place in my heart.Some things are accurate: Munich is the city of sticky sidewalks, and much German food is extremely scary, but much of the book is way off base.Read the book before you take your trip to Europe, then be pleasantly surprised at what you find. But it is very much worth reading for a laugh."
1,Crappy craftsmanship,"Painted by a blind person, the clasp in back is awkwardly positioned so the belt sticks out weird, it should be a little above center since the buckle is taller then it is long. restocking fee plus s/h back doesn't make itt worth returning"
4,Good review tool,"I'm using these along with 'Japanese for Everyone' and 'A Guide to Writing Kanji and Kana.' I got a little confused until I rearranged the cards to follow the order in 'Kanji and Kana.' =) Now I use 'Kanji and Kana' to actually learn the kanji, then stick a handful of cards in my purse so I can pull them out and review the ones I've learned during slow times at work, while I'm waiting for seating at a restaurant, etc.All that to say this: I wouldn't recommend them as your primary way of learning the kanji, but they're a good review tool and easy to carry around with you. Recommended, although my extremely nearsighted eyes wish the compounds were printed a little bit larger. =)"
5,A great book,These stories are easy to read and educational. The text is clear and pictures are both romantic and realistic. It is one of my favorite books.
4,"whimsical ""Life with Father"" set in Tuscany","Frank Schaeffer is great. I realize many think the book is an unfair jab at his family, but speaking from an objective standpoint, the book is damn funny. I grew up in a similar situation, though much less tragic, in Northeastern Italy, and Schaeffer's depiction of the Italian coastal town is beautiful. He correctly identifies the struggles and interchanges that take place in a fundamentalist Christian home overseas. I do not think I have read a more accurate depiction of being thirteen, in a missionary family, in Italy, and in love. It was a great read."
3,Slander of Family,"This book was well written and enlightening as to what Franky Schaeffer really thinks of his family.. All the details of this book are just a little too close for comfort to the way he grew up. Although I enjoyed the book for its literary merit, I thought that it was a very warped view of Protestant Christianity. I've also met some of his family, and most of them were extremely hurt by this book, especially because he was taking pot shots at his deceased father. It was , a very bittersweet book."
5,The new Huck Finn is Calvin Becker!,"Portofino was given to me by a friend. I missed a meeting because I stayed in my hotel room reading this book, unable to put it down. Portofino comes as close to being the most perfect novel I've read. It is ceryainly the funniest book I have read in years. I bought the sequal, Saving Grandma with a great sense of relief because the only thing I didn't like about Portofino was that it ended too soon. The two books taken together are not only a great comming of age saga but the best commentary on growing up in a religious family I've ever read. The women in our reading group all agree that these two books are the best we've read together. The generated the best discussions about life and the loudest laughs. I've gone broke giving out copies of Frank schaeffer's books."
1,Hitachi & bad service,"I have had my Hitachi for a year and a half it went out and now I have a 55"" piece of junk sitting in my floor,I also bought a protection plan and it's been sitting in my floor for the past 60 Plus days since Oct.22 past contract limits and looks like I'm getting a lawyer, the protection plan and Hitachi makes excuses and lies and breaks contracts Please be warned."
3,IS THIS A DBZ MOVIE?,DON'T BUY THIS DVD unless you like frieza. GOKU IS BACK! He knows the moves spirit bomb and kayioken attacks.I like GREGERY because he's cute!
2,Eh....,"I didn't care so much for these crackers. I know that they are supposed to be better for me, but I suppose I'm a die hard Cheese It fan. I like the Kashi granola bars because they are definitely healthy and chick full of good ingredients, but these had a weird aftertaste and the texture was a lot like the reduced fat Cheese Its. I didn't like the flavor and they were pretty bland anyway. Sorry, Kashi."
3,OK...not excellent.,"Having read A SEPARATE COUNTRY, by Robert Hicks, I decided to order THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH, as well. The reviews were good for the book.Both books are written a tad choppily, and do not flow as a novel usually does. However, THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH was good. The attraction between Carrie and Zachariah Cashwell gave a human touch to the book.Carrie McGavock and the Carnton Plantation are not fictional and provide a solid backdrop for the events in this historical fiction.I could recommend the book."
4,2008 felt more like 2004,"Very good political critique, but it could have gone further in its projections. Set in the election year of 2008, the revelations of fascist security measures were less shocking than what we'll probably see in the future. The torture scenes didn't even live up to what torture has already occurred. Good read, but Weber is a cautious futurist."
5,Beautiful and unusual,"I purchased this book this afternoon, and have already read it to my three year old twice. The effects on the wall are beautiful. I do wish it were longer, and it takes some time to find the best angle, but a wonderful concept."
1,"""The Journey Begins..."" Where's the Journey?","I must agree totally with Shannon. Very boring book. I bought this book assuming that there would be a series of books that cover ""the Journey"" all the way to the end, but nothing yet. As a stand alone book, terrible. As a beginning of a series, there is potiential.GIVE US THE SERIES!!!"
2,Polar Express Shadow Book,"I wish I could have gotten my hands on a local copy before buying it online. The proper affect was difficult to execute using an ordinary flashlight. The direct beam of a flashlight washes out the images. A more diffused light source is needed. The only solution I could find was to use a box with a cutout window and a light mounted inside not directly in line with the window. Using the indirect light source allowed a more diffused light which was able to create the shadow affect. In the end I did not use it because I did not have time once I received the book and was able to test it. I also would have to take the book apart. It was too unwieldly. A nice idea, but the execution was poor."
1,Certainly not what we expected,"My children and I are all fans of The Polar Express book and we did enjoy the movie as well. My youngest son, for whom I purchased this book, came to me with his 'review' before I had to ask... and then we gave the book away. Unfortunately, the book was not worth the money we paid for it, and even if it had been free, we would have not enjoyed it. This book is truly `the beginning', only telling the very first part of the story. While it is a Early Reader, it just wasn't interesting or enjoyable for my `beginning reader' to read, especially since we have the original book and the movie. Perhaps if it were sold in a set with other books that continue the story, it would be more enjoyable.."
2,not what i expected,we love the movie and the original book so we were disappointed to find that this reader was so short. where's the rest of the beautiful story???
2,Not much depth,I was a little disappointed. This book doesn't go into a lot of detail and depth like the other Polar Express books I've read. Quite boring!
5,"Very HOT, STEAMY as well as great scenery.","This video is Playboy at its finest. For all of you, who want HOT, STEAMY action, Sex on the Beach is one flick you won't want to miss."
2,Not Too Great,I personally think there was only one really hot woman in the entire thing. SO much for my expectations.
3,Playboy have done better!,"With the exception of two ladies, Sex on the Beach does not contend with some of the earlier releases. I enjoyed the quality of the video photography and the location is fantastic, but the models lacked the personality and beauty I expected. Sex on the Beach is a good buy if its the first playboy video you see. I would hence, suggest something else!"
1,"""The Right to Choose... What?""","It's a shame that Ms. Michelman spent a life protecting a ""right"" that she can't even bring herself to name in the title. I would have far more respect for her if she had the courage to use the word ""abortion"" instead of hiding behind the vague and misleading ""right to choose."""
1,A LOST SOUL,This is a book which encourages and enables people to live in rebellion against every moral standard that our country has been built on!
5,Kate Michelman has been the heart and soul of this claim for justice.,Noone has a better right to tell this story nor a better vantage point from which to tell it. Kate has spent her life fighting for women's rights and we need to hear what she has to say so we never forget what justice is all about.
4,Powerful case for choice,"I was very impressed by this book. Prior to reading it, I was (moderately) pro-life. Michelman convinced me I was wrong. She makes an eloquent argument for the pro-choice side. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind on the abortion issue. I would quibble with a few of her arguments- e.g. parental notification, but I still think she makes a strong case."
4,Good read.,"I bought this book based on the second part of its title: ""Mysteries of the Tropical Rain Forest and the Scientists Who Are Trying to Solve Them"". I thought that it was going to cover Central and South America. It does not. The author only covers a small island in Panama: Barro Colorado. But, don't let that stop you from buying this book. It is very interesting and well-written. If you are interested in learning about the plants and animals of the tropical rain forests, and how scientists attempt to unravel what's going on, then you will enjoy reading this book. I also plan on looking for a couple of the books the author read and gave as references."
3,Sounded alot better,This is cute but your child will have to use it on a slick surface for it to be able to move and I found that the rattle has to be pretty close for it to work. It's ok but I was disappointed in the product with the price I paid.
4,Richards Mom,"This was a fun toy for Christmas. Everyone seemed to enjoy watching it roll around. It is not a very interactive toy, but good for entertainment."
3,This is a very cute toy....but has limitations.,"Overall I like this toy but I wish they had tweaked it a little more. The rattle is not very sensitive and requires a vigorous shake or hit on the floor. When the Pooh is active it always seems to get too far away from you and you have to move for the rattle to be in range to activate Pooh again. When Pooh runs into and object he does not correct and change directions, you have to go and turn him around.I love the songs Pooh sings. It grabs my baby's attention. I would buy this again."
3,Very Cute with a Few Problems,"This is an adorable toy WHEN you can get it to work properly. This was purchased as a gift for my 1-year-old granddaughter. The first one Amazon sent me was obviously used and didn't work at all (huge disappointment on Christmas Eve). They promptly replaced it (return procedure is GREAT!). The new one works with the following exceptions: (1) It has no sensor to tell it to change directions when approaching an obstacle. Therefore, it runs into walls, furniture, your feet, etc. (2) You have to hold the rattle at just the right distance/angle to get the thing activated. (3) It will not work on our carpet AT ALL (granted, we do have pretty thick pad).Granddaughter loves it, so we're having to work around the problems. It sings 3-4 different songs and all are catchy and cute (i.e., not quite as annoying as some toys can be)."
5,I'm not alone,What an amazing book! Now I know to always trust my God given instincts. I was nervous about motherhood but you have reminded me that I can do this and do it well. Thanks and recommend this book to any new mom or mom going through a difficult time.
4,Now You Know What I Know,Outstanding! Pat takes you for a memorable walk down the path of reality and shares insights every parent can benefit from. A fun approach that's fun to read.
1,Hack writing in the sci-fi genre,"Before reading Omnifix, I enjoyed Pandora's Star by Peter Hamilton and Broken Angels by Richard Morgan. What a massive letdown Omnifix proved to be after the other books. Hamilton and Morgan know how to deliver interesting characterizations, page-turning plots, and are conversant in the fields of science germane to their respective novels.Omnifix's characterizations are juvenile, and calling major stretches of prose ""stilted"" is an understatement. Adding insult to injury, the plot is at best snore-inducing; at worst, outright silly.This book needed an editor in the worst way.Placed roughly 400 years in the future, the technology descriptions made it obvious that the author is woefully lacking in the science background necessary to make a hard science fiction story believable. The explanations given for the ""nanogens"" at the heart of this story are laughable.My advice: look elsewhere for reading enjoyment."
1,"Awful characters, awful book","Completely unbelievable characters in an unbelievable world. The whole book reads without any excitement, even during battle scenes. In fact the largest ""battle"" in the book, the climax, gets about 2 pages. The main character never really seems to be in danger. His relationship to the other characters makes him seem like a robot, which would have been an interesting literary device (considering he practically is one through most of the book) if I actually thought the author intended to do that.I've never bothered to write a review before, but this book was so bad I felt I had to."
2,sounds more like l.a. metal,"The track Wanted Man sure sound like an L.A. hair metal act, listen to those vocals. They sound much better on Thunderstruck, Riding Free which is more in the vein of euro-metal.Don't be fooled by their Denmark stamp."
2,"small, cheap - no frills","i had been thinking of getting the small size for my 38 special; and glad i opted for the medium. when they say medium, they do not tell what guns will fit; certainly not my 357.the item is lightweight, formed plastic with very thin foam inside. i paid 4.62 and that is a tad more than i think it is worth."
1,Way too small,"The quality of the case is just okay (cheap, thin foam) but they shouldn't advertise it as ""medium"". That lead me to believe a medium sized pistol would fit which it does not. In fact, I tried to pass it on to a friend and neither of his compact pistols would fit. I have my doubts that even a sub-compact pistol would fit. I can't imagine the small sized version fitting anything but a tiny Derringer. If you have any doubt whether your pistol will fit in this case, it's safe to assume it won't. Amazon did, however, give me a full refund."
2,"Measure twice, buy once",Had to return this because it was too small for a Beretta 96 or a Ruger P85. Makarov fits fine.
4,Fits the Ruger LCP,"I ordered the small for my Ruger LCP, but ended up getting the medium because the small was a bit too snug of a fit. I'm going to use it for securing it in my luggage when I travel."
5,Don't be fooled!,"This is about a whole lot more than baseball or growing up a military brat. This is about a generation that inherited a sense of duty and obligation from an earlier time that led them on a path of disillusionment, and in many cases, destruction. This beauty, a work of wonderous art, asks the unanswered questions of millions, and in its' own round about way, answers them. I love this book. I really love this book"
5,"Great Book, Great Service",The book arrived in very good condition in a very short period of time. You can't ask for more.
4,Good Source of Information,I'm just beginning to try out felting and bought this book upon a recommendation. It's very informative and easy to follow.
3,cute but a little disappointing,"really cute pieces to knit, but as a beginning knitter, it was disappointing to only find only one or two items I could do. It's a great book to look at but not one I could really use."
4,Fantastic beginner book,"I definitely agree with the review titled ""A Felting Must Have"". I looked over 3 books to get ideas for a felting project, as I have never done this before. I am also a novice knitter. I find that the tips and patterns are well presented and provide great guidance. I specifically like the various footwear items, which I am excited to try, and the suggestions for what to do with your test swatches is also very helpful."
2,If you saw the movie...,"This is one of those rare instances when the movie adaptation is MUCH better than the book. If I hadn't seen the movie, I might have liked the book, some what. There is little similarity between the book story line and the movie story line. I was hoping to find out more about the movie character from the book and instead met an entirely different character."
4,The World of the Airborne Worker,"Unlike the many who found this book to compare unfavorably with the movie, I have not seen the movie and therefore have no platform of comparison. I enjoyed this social commentary on modern corporate homelessness and ruthlessness, along with the skewering of ""downsizing,"" being ""let go,"" and all of the euphemisms for economic murder. I did find some aspects of the plot odd, such as the (spoiler alert) sudden health issues emerging quite late in the story. Moreover, will someone please not spare expenses with respect to proofreading? ""He payed his debt...."" Really!!!!!"
5,the secrets of airworld,"I just got finished reading this one. It's really funny, yet sad in a way. These guys always up in the air have these fleeting personal relationships, but business is everything. It's an interesting behind the scenes look into what you can do in airports and cities that you fly into. I haven't seen the movie because I didn't want it to spoil it for me, but it would be interesting what sort of actresses are playing the fleeting personal relationships roles the main character has."
2,A Good Short Story,"Funny premise, and a frequent business traveller will want to read the first 50-60 pages. No ""there"" in this novel and its story peters out quickly."
2,A hard book to get through.,"I had a really hard time getting into this book. I kept on reading and was hoping for the best, but I never really got into it. I'm going to still see the movie. Maybe it will be better.*UPDATE - 03/18/10*I watched the movie based on this book, and I liked it much more. I can't say that happens very often. It's almost always the other way around."
3,trying too hard,"Anyone who has obsessively checked the balances of their frequent flyer accounts (I have) will relate to some of the characteristics of this novel's protaganist Ryan Bingham. There is much in that regard to entertain fellow road warriors. The down side is that the author tries too hard to humorously satire the world of business consulting and corporate culture. He has less success here and some of the writing leans toward pretentious corporate babble. Binham's inner dialogue runs the gamut from very witty and insightful to just plain boorish. The worst example...""I"" I say. ""I"" I continue. ""I"" I offer. I pause. (page 267). I kept reading though and found some redeeming moments in the scenes set in Vegas. Kirn obviously knows the territory"
3,Professional travelers alert,"This is a fun book about traveling. At least it starts that way, if you fly on commercial airlines a lot you'll love the main character's flying habits. The book has some laughs. But it seems to wander, I mean the main character is quite a character. I'm not sure what the book is saying, maybe it is too 'smart' for me."
3,Just O.K.,I knew when I purchased this book it was just going to be O.K. (based on previous reviews). And...it was just that. I thought the beginning was strong and then things got weird and strange toward the end. I didn't really connect with any characters.
3,Quite a Mess,"There are some wonderful bits of writing in this novel and it's interesting to see the original work that was adapted into the award-winning film. Anyone who has traveled frequently on business will relate to the protagonist's perception of ""Airworld,"" and the disassociation of dipping in an out of multiple states and cities and lives. But overall the book cries out for an editor with a sharp pencil. There are too many characters, many of whom are introduced and then forgotten. There are too many subplots, and the minor characters are only sketches. And the twist at the end seems tacked on. You can see why it was picked up as a promising core for a screenplay (and why the book sat on the shelf for nearly a decade before that happened), but also why the film excised and adapted so much of the content."
4,Surrealistic farce and apt social commentary,"While the initial reviews of this when it came out in hard cover last year were lukewarm, seeing it (appropriately) in the airport and in paperback, I decided to pick it up. The reviews prepared me for a farce featuring a warped, disfunctional, and somewhat pathetic lonely guy. However, that is a distorted underestimation/misinterpretation of this work. Kirn has created substantive, thought provoking lampoon of the ongoing incessant, cynical, and invasive science of the study of consumer behavior and the marketing that it supports.Being a frequent traveller, I found this both amusing and depressing. It reinforced both my cynicism about the service industry, and my dissatisfaction with much of it.Beyond the social message, this is a novel with which frequent fliers will identify, and they will view Kirn's depiction of the quotidian existence of business travel as representing their ongoing plight, and grind."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I had never read a Walter Kirn book before and saw this one at a local bookstore and it looked interesting and it seemed interesting based on what I read standing there. When I got home and started reading it, I was very disappointed.I was so confused and upset because of my confusion that I had a real hard time reading this book. After I finished it, I said ""that is the worst book I have ever read.""Please don't waste your time or money!"
1,A bomb,I understand the world of airline travel (I'm a former gate agent for a major airline) and thought Kirn's book was a series of endless bourish rambling about life as a frequent traveler. One of the worst books I've ever read.
1,Crashed and Burned,"The cover of this book features seven travelers in suits jetting through the air in various directions. An eighth shows a trail of smoke behind him and has crashed and is burning. Right under this figure on the cover is the name Walter Kirn. He is the author of this mess and all I can say that from the cover itself, the reader is fairly warned. Christopher Buckley, who may be singularly responsible for the early success of this book by writing the feature review for the NY Times Book Review a few weeks ago, must have been suffering from some bad gin when he favorably reviewed this. Then perhaps, I am not avant guarde enough to appreciate it, but I found it a monumental waste of time and money. I will send this book to anyone who will pay the postage, but act fast because it isn't going into my library."
3,"Ok Book, But Would Have Liked More Airline Jargon","Being a frequent flyer, and one who really gets in to the miles and points game, I eagerly bought this book and read it.I liked it overall, and appreciated the insights in to the travel lifestyle. However, some parts would go on too long that were not interesting.Also I would have hoped that the character would have given out more airline jargon, and educated the general public on the special favors that a million mile flyer might get from ticket agents, etc. The book should have examined both the printed frequent flyer rules, and compared that to what actually happens at airports as agent and passenger have one on one interactions.However, I still would recommend the book, and cannot think of anything better that is written in a book. For travel advice and for information about the frequent travel lifestyle, would also suggest you see the web site:http://www.flyertalk.com"
1,Throw Up in the Air,"As a consultant who has traveled weekly for the past 6 years, I was looking forward to this book. Wow, was I dissapointed. Mr. Kim rambled and wandered as few writers can. The plot (if there was one) was painful and the character development was poor. I really didn't care about one singel character in the story. It wasn't surreal, it was just bad. What a waste of time and money."
2,Platinum Disappointment,"Up in the Air is perhaps the best written awful book I've ever read. Walter Kirn assembles words well, and he's an astute observer of some aspects of frequent traveling. But the story never reaches a comfortable cruising altitude. There's nothing likeable about Ryan Bingham, his seatmates, the woman he occasionally sleeps with, or the family he grew up with. The several weak plots badly woven throughout the book made me feel like I was sitting on a plane, overhearing parts of several conversations, none of which I cared about. As it droned on like the engine of a 767, it was clear the book had no flight plan.A few pages of this sad, cynical tale might have made a good essay; maybe a few pages more could have been spun into a readable short story. But a novel it's not. And the tired little book certainly isn't worthy of all the publicity it's receiving."
1,"Great Movie, Horrible Book","As a frequent business traveler, I loved the film Up In The Air. When I saw that it was based on a novel of the same name, I picked up the volume eagerly and read it. Very rarely is a movie better than the book, but that is the case here. Do not bother. The names are the same, and the protagonist of the book flies for his job, but that is where the similarities end. The novel is basically a week in the life of a self-absorbed business traveler obsessed with gaining one million frequent flier miles. There is no wedding, no tag-along business trainee, and barely any Alex. The screenwriters for the movie did not adapt their screenplay - they rewrote it, to much better effect. I am amazed that this novel was even published, and it is a crime that it is again seeing the light of day due to the excellent film. Do yourself a favor and give this garbage a pass. There are many, many books out there that are a much better way to invest your time."
1,A post-modern turkey,"I bought this book, fortunately in a used bookstore and as a paperback, because I was so impressed with the movie. Well, the book is nothing like the movie. Maybe Kirn's writing style may work for a short-story in a magazine like ""The New Yorker,"" but I found his too-clever observations and mental twists and turns, unsuspenseful plot, ambiguous characters, and forced dialogue to be tiring after reading more than a chapter or two at a sitting. Save your time and money and avoid this crappy post-modern imitation of a real novel."
3,An ideas book (and there's nothing wrong with that),"I love the desparate romantic stuff in this story. I like the ideas behind the 'leaving the baggage behind but then understanding its all about the baggage'. There is something a tad cloying but perhaps it is that the ideas feel a little bit obvious. But if you like ideas books, you might likeA Life Lived Horizontally"
2,Falls apart midway through,"Like many others, I saw the movie first and bought the book because I enjoyed the movie. I think the plot in the movie is much stronger, in part because because of when it was released; it more accurately reflects the sad reality of today's business climate and post 9/11 air travel. Both offer a cynical look at that business climate, but movie does it better. The secondary characters particularly Alex, are more vividly portrayed in the movie.The book starts off fairly well, but starts to fall apart midway through, and by the end, it's a confusing and uninteresting mess. The characters have become caricatures. The finale is particularly disappointing. I don't mind an unresolved ending (such as in the movie version of Sideways), but here, too much is unresolved, nor is it believable. Not worth the time or money."
3,Questions in the air..,"It started out witty and seemed to have a point. But it seemed to be just one long conversation with himself by the end. I didn't think it was as bad as some reviewers stated, but it wasn't as good as other have stated either. I liked it a lot and thought it was a fast, intelligent read until near the end. Then it lost it's purpose, or I lost what it was trying to convey. I thought it was actually going somewhere but by the end it just kept flying and where it was suppose to land is beyound me. I'll watch the movie just to see if goes along with the book."
2,Having read the book I still have no idea what it is about. I await the movie to explain it to me.,"Why I read ItI heard a segment on NPR about the Toronto Film Festival in which they praised the new George Clooney movie based on this book. I always like to read books being made into movies so I picked this up.The GoodThe character was engaging and I like the idea of following a person who is a consistent air traveler.The BadThe plot was all over the place, and only took shallow dips in each location.The Ugly (my opinion)Having read the book I still have no idea what it is about. I await the movie to explain it to me."
5,What a wonderful book...,"I hate watching movies before reading the books they are written from, because the books often times will be so different (ie: Forrest Gump) that it makes you wonder what anyone was thinking when they wrote the screenplay.This book turned out to be a pleasant surprise, not only because it stands on its own, but it is a different story in some ways (good ways).The story is so much more raw and has an honesty the movie tried to portray, but trying to be appealing to Hollywood and Clooney's grin, came only slightly close to achieving.I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an honest look into one man's life, but also for anyone who saw the movie and is iffy about picking up the book, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise. It's the same, but very different, and worth your time. Congratulations on a wonderful piece of work. ~ Vincent Yanez (author, Einstien's Shutter)"
1,A MAJOR disappointment,"As a frequent business traveller, I was excited about this book after reading the strong review in the NY Times. What a great premise! What a terible book! The characters were completely one-dimensional and the ""insights"" into corporate America were trite at best.Like a couple of the other reviewers, I considered putting this book down, but kept plugging away to see what would happen. As a warning to other who may be in a similar quandary, ""Don't bother - nothing happens.""Luckily, I DID get this book out of the library so at least it was ""only"" my time that was wasted."
1,DREADFUL--A waste of time and money,"Up In The Air is one of the most dreadful books I have ever read. I bought it on the strength of Buckley's review in the NY Times. Several times I considered putting the book down, yet stayed with it. Too bad- it was a waste of time."
1,The worst ever!!!,Sorry but this one is the worst book i've ever read. I would give it a ZERO star if it was possible.
1,I'll skip the movie for sure,Being made into a picture I thought the book would have promise. Somewhere around page 20 I was ready to toss it. Plugged on but found nothing else of interest. Just a story of a man depressed by his job; the story around the million miles isn't that entertaining either.
5,"A couple of years old, but still fantastic to play!","Jedi Knight is a first person shooter game, like Doom, or Quake, but with a Star Wars twist. To me the familiar Star Wars aliens and even the new ones make this game a true joy to play. Jedi Knight easily has one of the best game soundtracks ever with the booming symphony sounds in the backgroud. The graphics and gameplay are also a sight to be seen. A truely fantastic game, anyone who enjoys first person shooters should try this one out."
5,Add Spice to your boring computer !,"My computer started collecting dust until I saw a video game ad in a magizine . So I went out and bought it. My best choice ever ! There is only one set-back , you don't get to fight Darth Vader (Like on the Box) . When I got home and started playing it. I digged into the box and found the Mysteries of the Sith! It is more confusing (weird missions and creatures). And the Teen rating is a bunch of bull , the Star Wars movies are more violent."
5,One of the Best,"This game not only impresses through expertly designed levels, but its graphics and opponents are also some of the best in the genre. The big force, however, is the story, where one has the ability to choose between the dark side and the light side. The perfectly produced movies, or cutscenes, will keep you at this game for hours on end; its force powers introduce an entirely new variable into the category of action games, of which it is one of the clear leaders."
2,"Dark Forces 2 Good, Mysteries of Sith Bad","The Dark Forces may be the best first-person action video game, but it gets Marred by MOS. It was too easy to kill myself in MOS simply by force jumping. I died a hundred times because there was something overhead when I jumped. Once I died because I jumped straight up, but took damage from the fall. Another time I was on this ledge and couldn't get back up--every time I jumped, I would bounce off the wall and die. When I went to several web sites to get help on how to get off that ledge, the best that I could find was 'it is tricky' to get off the ledge. After dying several hundred times I got bored and quit. I've never gone back."
3,dated,"This game was good in it's time, but by today's standards is lacking in terms of graphics and gameplay. I would wish for a better mapping system that is easy to comprehend. The levels are mazes, and I got lost so often I had to use a cheat to complete most levels. The shooting was easy, while navigating the game map was hard. If not for the cheats, I would have found it unplayable. In addition, Mysteries of the Sith cutscenes would play at a speed too fast to see or hear. Perhaps my system is too modern for this ancient software.I suppose for the diehard SW fan, any game is good, but if I want to see Mara Jade, I am better off with a book or comic. The MOT renditions of Mara left much to be desired graphically.I wish that you were not stuck playing Kyle Katarn most of the time. He is just a minor character, and not very interesting."
2,Ok but the levels stink.And the weapons are very bad.,"I love the star wars games from x-wing to the phantom menace. I have them all. But there is one game that is not worth it,and that is jedi knight dark forces 2. The story is not exciting. (But it would make a good movie) This game should have been a movie. Not a game. The weapons are very bad. Very bad detailed weapons, bombs,explosions. The explosions suck! Very Very bad! Mysteries of the sith should have been the first part of the game, and jedi knight should have been the add-on. And multiplayer is ok not very good. This is what I don't like in multiplayer. Some players join and mess up the fun in it. Lucas arts allows hacks in games (or cogs) which is bad. The skins are not good and detailed. And thats what I think about this game. I do not like this game. Buy it and be disappionted."
2,Not nearly as inspired as Dark Forces...,"Better graphics but less fun to play. Better sound but the music doesn't ""fit"" as well. Less interesting storyline and nowhere near as fun to play.Dark Forces II is, quite honestly, a bit of a bore."
5,use the force,the grghics are good the filmclips are cool. you get to use a lightsaber its like doom with a story line and one more thing a morality scale you must do good to have light side powers but if you want to go crazy you can use dark side powers. motsit better in one way no morality scale and just as fun.
5,Wild about wild about books,"What a totally delightful book! My granddaughter loved it, and equally important, so did I as the outloud reader. Judy Sierra's wit is clever enough to appeal to both the child and the child within us. Recommend it totally."
4,"Great book, but arrived damaged","This book is fantastic! Funny for adults, and fun for kids. This copy that I ordered did arrive damaged (torn cover) and looking shabby, but I contacted Amazon and they refunded part of the cost. I definitely recommend this book!"
5,Wild About This Book,"This book is a joy! I found it in the library at the elementary school where I teach Special Needs students ages 5-12. While the kids were spellbound by the pictures and the cleverly written rhymes, I was just giddy with delight reading the engaging text! References to Seuss, Harry Potter, and other familiar names (for the students!)made the book all the more personal for the young and not-as-young (the adults in the room!) I can't wait to get my own copy!"
2,If you like air raid sirens you might like this.,This is a very beautiful teapot. If you collect them this wouldmake a great addition to a collection. If you want to use it ona daily basis. Id think twice. I dont know if it is just the onethat I got... but mine sounds like one of those air raid sirensthat go off.
3,Cover your ears!,"Attractive, good functioning kettle. However, the ""whistle"" sounds like a smoke alarm or car horn & is very unappealing."
5,You don't want this book to end.,"This was a great book! I feel like the characters became my friends and I miss them since I finished the book. Your heart will ache for the pain that Wendy, Josh and Louie feel.I know this was a novel but it feels like a true story. Joyce Maynard has taken a tragic event in history and made it deeply personal. In addition to feeling the personal sadness for anyone who lost a love one on 9/11/01 this book is also a coming of age book for young people. I highly reccommend this book as a way to open dialog for blended families.Old fans of Joyce Maynard will enjoy this book and those less familiar with her will want to read eveything she ever wrote."
5,A Book for ALL Audiences...,"I picked up ""The Usual Rules"" at the recommendation of a good friend. I was completely impressed! As a former middle school English teacher and current middle school principal, I found the portrayals of the young people in the book to be extremely well crafted and accurate. I've worked with kids like Wendy, Amelia, Todd, and Violet for nearly thirty years. Their experiences with grief, friendship, and growing up ring true. As a father I was deeply touched by little brother Louie's response to the loss of his mother and the absence of his older sister.I worry that this book might be pigeon-holed as a ""chick-book"" or a work just for young adolescents. That would be completely unfair. This former football coach was moved to tears at times by the skillful portrayal of the characters. I've not only recommended the book to friends, but am sharing it with my faculty and students. Kudos, Ms. Maynard! Thank you for a brilliant and moving piece of work!"
2,Swivel Stool - Revisited,"Pros: modern look, good hydraulics, good range of height adjustments, solid materialsCons: seat could use a little more padding, sculpted edges should be slightly tallerHere's an update: after 3 months of use the welded spots on the base (underneath where the shaft goes through) that stabilize the chair failed. I thought not problem, a couple of nuts and bolts would hold it in place again. Well they did for 15 seconds then the metal plate that is the stabilizer torn (yes the metal tore as it's very soft). Very poor construction!"
3,Not as good as expected,"I bought this because of the positive reviews, and was very disappointed.1) The handle is flimsy, so the pot actually moves around while holding it (which is scary if it's hot).2) The lid doesn't actually fit well on the pot.3) Every part of hit heats up very quickly, and it's difficult to grab any part of it with a towel or mittens.4) The surface scratches and stains very quickly. The bottom of my pan is already messed up from only a few uses."
3,Archetype,"the best part of this CD is the drumming. Dave K. played drums only on this CD, then he left the band shortly after. he used to play for an awesome Philly band called Self Induced that broke up years ago. he now plays in a kick-[butt] band called Wreck The Day. check 'em out!"
5,Vanilla makes you feel close.,"What a great name for this pack-o-goodies! The natural ingredients in these products are amazing. I am a nutritionist and always search for natural and clean products, and V'tae is the company I am always happy with. It smells good enough to eat!"
4,Rangiroa and Huahine,"The guide helped out a lot during our research and our 10 days on Rangiroa/Huahine. Especially useful for those close aiport hotels when arriving at 2am. Some of the information on Huahine was out of date because of the hurricane they had in early '98 (>), especially the recommended dining section.However, the guide was great in helping us enjoy our vacaton to the upmost"
1,Will it ever end?,"Sometimes it's a good thing to look at what a band can do over a period of time. Sometimes it is those who score a knock-out on their first CD then fade into oblivion thereafter, but in the case of Magellan one can hope that the possibilities will improve. If it does, the earlier ones won't sound so bad after all. Not so with these guys. Any one of their CD's is so predictable that you can exchange CD's with the jewel boxes and not know which one you're listening to. I just cannot imagine that they sell enough to retain a contract with a legit record company. It could mean that they're buying enough personally to make it look like their titles are 'selling' in order to maintain the contract. I spent nearly 10 years with large retailing corporations (whose identities will remain anonymous) and buying one's own discs is as old as the record industry. Product buyers nickname them 'slimes'. As lackluster as Magellan is I'm not surprised at all."
3,I keep hoping and I'm always dissapointed.,"Its Trents goofy voice...thats what it is. Let Steve Walsh or Labrie or Damian Wilson sing...anybody but Trent. He just annoys the heck out of me. But I keep buying the dumb cds hoping for better days...but alas, same ole same ole. Call me biased, but I hope you like it better than I do cause I know the guy is trying real hard to write great tunes. Luckily I bought it second hand for 6 bucks. That was the saving grace of the whole deal."
4,Great Book,Good Philosphy book. I needed it for a Philosophy course. Good to have if intereste din Philosophy. Easy to understand
3,over-scholarly and sterile,"This is a useful academic tool - you have the Greek fragments followed by translations, and than the commentaries. For those interested in understanding the presocratics, rather than getting a map of the field of study as it presently stands, this is highly useless and even possibly inhibiting. The academic apparatus is overloaded and makes the book cumbersome to follow. The commentaries are extremely sterile, and the end seem to be sticking to the most common-sense and uninspiring interpretations in the name of scientific warrant, that you end up thinking you don't (and probably nobody) have much to learn from presocratics, unless you need to pass some exams and write some papers to get a job. Not recommended unless you are a pro in need of a reference tool."
1,Buggy buggy buggy,"ACDSee gets a lot of user-interface ideas right, but they have a long and very serious problem with quality control. I've used every version of this software since 4.0, and the bugs just drive me crazy. It crashes, it writes messed up jpg files, its resizin filters have off-by-pixel mistakes that shift images. And it just never gets better in this regard. Hire a new programmer, guys!"
2,There are better for better pricing,"It only prints good quality when using HP paper. Using any other glossy or photo paper is impossible, the ink just blodges completely and the print comes out like a blodgy waterpaint painting. After comparing with my old Deskjet 950c (only A4 though) i'll rather stick to my old Deskjet. I used the same non HP photo paper and tested on my Deskjet 950c and the prints came out Beautiful! yet however the same paper in the designjet, oh no, forget it, if you hold the paper scew the ink starts running down the paper. I tried every prossible setting, even low ink high drying time and minimum quality print, nothing works, it just blodges to a complete mixed color inkball. I also compared printing speeds, and the old Deskjet 950c still prints 10 A4 full color high quality prints ALOT faster then the Designjet 30... sorry, but that Designjet isnt worth the money. I regret buying it."
2,Low-priority Astor,"Umm,... why did this label spread 60-some minutes of music over two cds?It's not like this is prime-time, essential Piazzolla. It was recorded in 1977, and, on the plus side, it is decently recorded. But the music feels a little bloodless to me, compared with live recordings of the era (check out the Milan-label issues with the 1920s looking paintings/illustrations on the covers) and studio recordings such as Zero Hour, which I'm sure you've already heard if you are reading this. Here you will find some string backings which don't add much, and some 1970s-style studio drumming licks, which take a little away from the mood. I'm not an expert on Astor, but all of the four or five albums I have of his (on American Clave and Milan) beat this. This one might be for completists only."
2,Missing Pieces,"Aside from the fact that my son opened this at Christmas and it was missing the connectors, end caps, and the bolts and screws, it was nice. I guess next time I'll buy him a piece of pipe since that's what I felt arrived."
2,Very Very Modern,"I was disappointed in this book. As a traditional lace knitter I was anxious to see what was being done currently. Nothing appealed to me in the entire book. This is of course a matter of taste; it reminded me of ""modernized"" editions of Shakespeare, or operas that don't work at all.knittingduck"
2,"Yummy Pictures, Unreliable Recipes","I finally got the book after waiting for a month. The food in the photos all looked so delicious that it made me drool. I was eager to try out the recipes and I thought I start with the Raddish Cake. To my horror, the instructions were unclear! The author did not mention what to do with the raddish! Luckily, I had another book which has a perfect recipe for it. A few days later, I thought I try the Crystal Duck Dumplings and although I followed the instructions perfectly, the dough did not turn out well at all. I think it would be a long time before I would ever try any of the recipes again. Maybe I am just not good at making dim sum."
1,Bad recipes,"I bought this book and was very excited when I read about the author's background and list of dim sum items. When I started making some of the recipes, I realized that the recipes were a joke. It is well known that dim sum chefs will not truly tell all the methods/secrets of making the items and this is true with this book. I have a culinary background and my grandmother knows how to make some of these dishes. It seems as if the author purposely left out the correct ingredients or had incorrect measurements. I tried the black sesame roll. When my mother read the recipe, she laughed and said that he left out the most important ingredient:rice flour. Without it, it's just sludge. I tried making the steamed buns and they weren't successful. I won't even try to make his radish cake because I think my grandmother's is the best. Don't buy this book, you'll have better success searching the internet for recipes that are better written."
2,Recipes were clearly not tested.,"If you want beautiful photos, this is the book. Many of the recipes are a joke and inedible.Example: If you try making what looks like taro root hash browns in the photo, you end up with a mash potato texture mush that is sooooo salty that it's inedible. The recipe calls for too much sugar as well as salt. I measured the ingredients accurately."
3,Difficult recipes for novices,The recipes in this book are beautifully illustrated but the majority will be extremely difficult for novices to follow. Wrapped dumplings in particular are tricky to master and this book gives scant instructions and no step-by-step pictures to illustrate the techniques. I also note with interest that some critics have had very disappointing results with many of the dishes even though they claim to have followed the recipes faithfully. The book is also badly indexed and I wish that the author included pinyin transliterations in addition to Cantonese. I look at the book from time to time when I am looking for ideas but I have to say that it is not a particularly useful item in my collection.
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"Exactly what I would have gotten if ordered through the company directly, but I got it 3 times as fast! There were no bugs no unsightly wounds or cut marks on the tree, and to me the pot it comes in looks like a rock... not like what other users have described. I also had no issues with the tree as other reviewers have experienced. The tree is healthy, well rooted in the pot and had no dead or damaged foliage. This is only maybe my 10th bonsai tree so I'm by no means an expert, but I do know a thing or two about bonsai trees and the tree I received was extremely healthy and ready to be trained, easily into a broom style or, with some work, another popular style or two. Overall, I received a healthy tree very quickly (as I have Prime and got 2 day shipping for free) and I give this product and Amazon's care with packaging the tree 5 stars."
3,Umbrella tree,"This is a nice looking plant, but absolutely nothing like the picture. I guess the people will see how it fares."
4,Excellent Baby Book,I loved this baby book. I can't wait to fill in the rest of my book throught the duration of my pregnancy. It will be so much fun. I would definetely recommend this book to all expectant mothers.
1,Dissappointed,"This baby book is very poor quality. The giraffe sticker on the front pops off, the pages are not glossed, allowing ink to bleed through to the next page, and the pages are covered in colored dots which makes it hard to read handwritten entries. I'm very disappointed, and had to replace it with the Pearhead Babyprints Babybook -- which is higher quality and better looking on the inside."
5,Love It!,I looked at a lot of baby books and this one is just perfect. We do not know if we are having a girl or a boy and it is great for either. The pages cover just about everything you would ever want to remember ....down to how much weight Daddy gained during the pregnancy :) Very cute on the inside and well laid out.
5,Everything you need,WE have this book for our first son and are buying one for our second child. Very complete with a few pages for pregnancy and plenty of pages for pictures. It was the most complete book I could find with just about every first you could think of without being overly ridiculous about details you could never keep up with.
2,Not my favorite,"I am a Chamberlain fan, but this book does not compare to her others. The story line is contrived and rather unrealistic. I don't see how the events in this book could ever happen in real life. The main idea, a mother who takes off with her child rather than lose custody, has promise, but becomes a silly story line rather than the touching story it could have been."
5,This one is great!,I've read a bunch of books by Diane. This is one of my favorites. It is suspenseful nd keeps you guessing. As usual her endings are complete and don't leave you hanging which I like too.
3,"Really slow start, predictable climax.",This book was just o.k. The storyline was pieced together and not sewn up very tightly. The storyline is also set in the early nineties which is boring!
3,Not up to her normal standard,"This is the fourth novel by Diane Chamberlain that I have read. Although it's a decent read, it doesn't approach the standard of her earlier novels. The plot is somewhat transparent and the depth of characterization is lacking. Her effective technique of slowly unraveling a character's past is not present here. There is little we don't know about the major characters early on, except for the mad bomber plot that lacks credibility. The romantic angle is diluted from an overall lack of drama (we know where her heart lies from page one). For those new to this author, I recommend trying Fire and Rain, Reflection or Keeper of the Light instead."
4,Another great book by a great artist!,"I haven't read a book by Chamberlain that I didn't like. I think this was my third favorite. The Secret Life was my absolute fav, then The Midwife's Confession was second and now this one is my third. I have read many of her books and they all are so interesting. I like the twists and story lines that women can relate to."
5,great read,This story has you gripped and emotionally torn from the start. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a heart.
4,Another fgreat Diane Chamberlain book!,"I love reading Diane Chamberlain novels. I have never been disappointed in her books. Escape Artist was thought provoking and suspenseful. As a mother I could relate to the main characters desire to keep her son with her and safe at all costs! I do feel this one did drag the story line out somewhat, however never enough that I wanted to put it down. I think I finished this book in less than a week !"
4,Not as good as CeeCee Wilkes,"This is the second book I have read by this author and I will be reading more. I liked the general premise of the story, but didn't care for the ""list"" part of it, as that just seemed way too extreme to me. Peggy's whole change of heart also seemed a bit unbelievable. Overall, a good book and a quick read for me."
4,Excellent read but preditible.,I liked this book a lot. Interesting cast of characters and good plot development. I haven't read a Diane Chamberlain book yet that I didn't like and this was as good if not better than the 10 I have read so far. She is my author of choice right now until Jodi Picoult gets busy. I like their style of writing.
4,A mothers love,"This is a story about the lengths a mother will go to keep and protect her child, giving up all that is herself to maintain a bond with her child is the only option. The ability of this author to draw you in and make you feel like you are living the life of this mother is amazing and a joy to read. I missed the characters when I finished the book and wanted it to go on and on!!"
5,Wow! For Kids That Really Need a Good Book to Read,"I started reading ""Hidden In Plain Sight"" and I couldn't put it down. I kept laughing and gasping, and everyone around me kept asking what was wrong. I just had to start saying, ""You have to read this book!"" I only have one suggestion though, make sure you don't have anything else to do when you start reading, because you won't be able to put it down."
4,Hummingbird Garden notecards,"Because I had bought and used Insect Friends notecards previously, I thought I would try these, too. They are nice, but for me not quite as lovely as the Insect Friends. As with the other ones, the envelopes are very special themselves."
4,Great cd.,"It was much better than when I had it previously. It had alot of good guitar and keyboards, long songs."
1,Disappointing,"Many years ago I had the ultimate in orange blossom honey from a Mennonite grove in Sarasota, FL - a very pale gold, intensely flavored honey that just exuded the perfume of orange blossoms from the opening of the container. I've been in search of such an OB honey ever since.And believe me - this ain't it. It's color is about clover honey dark and I really don't get any orange blossom in scent or flavor. Now, if it's taken as a non-OB honey, I don't really have any complaints with it. And I'm going to use it in my hot tea as the weather cools. But orange blossom? Not really.Perhaps an apiary in PA is not the place to look for my holy grail of honey. I'll stick to apiaries in Florida from here on out."
3,Somewhat disappointed..,the skin is somewhat difficult to apply.. I have serious doubts as to it s protection abiltity.. I will choose not to depend on it or to purposefully test it!
1,Rubber Bumper Ba-Humbug,"Poorly designed, poorly fitting, bulky and unwieldly, likely to cause camera to be dropped. Not Designed to work with accessories for the camera, will not work with the external battery pack used by many peopleon thier cameras. The lens shield is a slip on, does not stay in position and can disable or damage your zoom function. Not effective as asun shield, lens cap almost impossible to install or remove with unit installed. Manufacture is totally non-responsive to inquires."
4,Camera armor,"Camera Armor Protection System, Black Color, for Nikon D70 /70S SLR CameraI really like it. As a sports photographer, and a person who carries more than 1 camera this product provides protection from elements and jousling.I recently ordered a second one. One minor caveat, I did have the front lens protector slip off unnoticed. Watch that!"
2,Camera Armor for Nikon D70,I bought this thinking that it would protect my camera from everyday bumps. However after I installed it I found it to be cumbersome and not a really good thing to have on a camera for everyday use. It now sits in a box. Save your money.
3,hard to adjust,"I will NOT be sending this back BUT I really will not test it as for shock, I bought as part of a package with the strap (I REALLY LIKE the strap). The camera armor looks as though it might help with water resistance . Also the sun shade is first rate I replaced my Nikon Shade with it."
5,Encyclopedic but with loads of stuff to play.,"As an adult beginner, ""The Art"" gives me everything I need to complement my lessons - answers to basic questions of theory and technique, progressive exercises, technical principles illustrated by hundreds of phrases from the masters. And scales, scales, scales. Especially nice are the complete two-part scales of Cherubini."
5,super cute,"hillary knight's illustrations are of the quality rarely found in children's books anymore, detailed, witty, and charming. the list is wonderful and will bring back any adult's own memories of childhood longings/unfairness! wanting only to have pointy crayons, to pet every dog and cat regardless of pointy teeth or germs! i love this book, it's a classic and it's great that it's been republished."
5,SUPER!!,"The Best Book I ever will Propably read, I read it in one evening! For anyone, who wants a great book, Esperanza should be at the top of their list!"
5,Wonderful Book,"This is an amazing book. Esperanza was my first in this series that I've read , I can't wait to read all the others."
4,Interesting Tale of the Tragedy of Culloden,"Yolen and Harris set this story in 1745 with the return of Bonnie Prince Charlie, son of the ""Pretender to the English Throne"", who has come to Scotland in order to claim the throne for his own. Duncan MacDonald is a 14 year old boy who is taken in by the glory of war and honor and wishes longingly to accompany his father to battle. Things developing as they do, Duncan receives his chance to be in the thick of fighting at the devastating battle of Culloden and he discovers that true war is not anything like he'd thought it would be. A side story of the ""fits"" Duncan suffers becomes a major plot point later on but is a bit of a distraction. The story is flavored with the dialect of the Scottish people and a glossary is included at the end. This is a realistic portrayal of a young boy's dreams of war and the inevitable shattering of not only the dreams but of lives as well. Good, solid, interesting but not riveting reading."
1,Warning. Stay away.,"Of 10 cans purchased 7 were swollen to some degree and the other 3 the contents were completely ""dissolved"" into some kind of a salty mush. Since these cans are not open dated I couldn't tell the vintage."
1,awful,i ordered 10 cans from amazon. they look terrible and taste terrible. the anchovies are like mush. and they are way too salty. will stay away from it.
4,Courtroom thrills,"Marty Nickerson, a former prosecuting attorney, is now working for the first time as a defence attorney in Cape Cod and is called upon to defend Buck Hammond, a man with a spotless record who shot Hector Monteros, the man who kidnapped and brutally raped Buck's young son. The trouble is that a TV news crew filmed the event as it happened and that Buck refuses to use a plea of temporary insanity, insisting that he knew what he was doing and would do it again. Marty teams with Harry Madigan, her law partner and lover to produce a credible defence in the face of overwhelming evidence and at the same time, defend a battered woman whose live-in attacker was murdered. M/s Connors own courtroom experience comes into play here with her expert knowledge of procedures and some almost unbelievable courtroom characters who, one only prays, we will never have to face in person. I look forward to her next book."
4,I Certainly Didn't See THAT coming.........,"I don't read much fiction so when I find a book I that really holds my attention like ""Temporary Sanity"" did, I take special note.The whole book was woven together very well - I enjoyed each character - even the ones who were created especially so we would be frustrated with them.Marty is very likeable as the able and highly intuitive defense attorney with a heart. I can imagine the small firm she works in is actually a positive place to hang your hat. (This must be fiction *smiling*.)Not only is the writing thoroughly engaging and entertaining, the subject matter is one we can all relate to - in all its horrifying glory.What worked especially well was the ending. I had no clue what was coming. I love when I am taken by surprise like this - kudos to Rose Connors for pulling off such a delightful conclusion."
4,Good legal thriller,"This is one in a series of legal thrillers by Rose Connors. She has left the prosecutor's side and joined defense counsel in this, her third, (I think)novel. The continuing characters are interesting, and the Cape Cod setting lends some local color as well. Being familiar with ""the cape,"" I found it fun to visualize the various locations mentioned. Hers are not gripping page-turners but comfortable reads with thoughtful story lines, agreeable protagonists, and plausible situations. Good reads!"
1,mischaracterised internal page conditions,"purchased used very good (former library) book, stated as one of best former library books. Book's outside was 'good' not very good. The inside pages were smeared with dried debris, foods, markings, etc. worst used book I ever bought"
5,exciting viewing,"fantastic, amazing and at times unbelievable footage combined with a great soundtrack. Kept me glued to the TV screen. Perfect for the sports enthusiasts in your life. Not bad as a travelogue either. Fun."
1,Unsafe recommendations,"I sat down and read through this book page by page this weekend for suggestions to add variety to my 9 month old's diet. It recommends all these foods that are unsafe by most American pediatrician's standards like whole eggs, strawberries, citrus fruits, peanut butter, nuts, very fatty meats, etc. Many recipes are very involved with a slew of ingredients or those not normally served like leeks or corriander. The bulk of the book is recipes for toddlers who can eat most table food, anyway. You could just as easily use a recipe book on casseroles or the Joy of Cooking. The illustrations lack diversity which made me think the book was already a decade or more old. Look elsewhere."
4,one opinion,"While I don't always agree with Mrs. Lotz's theology, her life applications are insightful. Am currently using this book as a devotional, and was attracted to it by hearing her reciting from it on the radio: I had to have those passages where she speaks just of Jesus! They are pure poetry. So glad that my web-surfing with some of her keywords led me to the book. She has illuminated some key passages for me."
1,Waste of money!,"Don't waste your money on this one. If you are really interested in conspiracies on Diana, go and surf the net. You'll get more than what you find in this book-and then some!"
2,Left me Cold,"I read this novel after reading the excellent ""Whose death in the Tunnel?"" by Aaron Becker. This book did not begin to compare. I read it to the end hoping for a glimmer but it left me cold."
5,I cry with happppiness,"Number 5, The Child Comes Home, touches my heart, Number 15, Empty Streets, again touches my heart. Katie, all of your songs touch my heart. I immediately miss all those who have passed before me...my mother, my father, my dear little lamb, mom. Yet, I'm not unhappy, but trully feel closer to them than I thought possible. Please write more loving songs...it helps.joe"
1,Ack...,"I LOVED the movie and was expecting a good read from the book. I was way disappointed. The style of writing is not very good, and Elle is pretty dumb throughout the book, never getting any better (unlike the movie). I continually cringed as I read parts. All the good parts in the movie were added by the screenwriters (they must have seen an OK plot form this book that could be WAY improved buy their changes). If you want to read this book just because you saw the movie, don't bother. All the good characters from the movie were added. Overall, the book was extremely dumb and I still can't imagine how it was published in this form without undergoing major editing for both style and content!"
1,"Love the movie, did not like the book","Okay, I tried to like this book, but can't. Found it very boring and couldn't wait until I finished it. Love the movie, but this book is dull."
2,Almost........,The first thing that one must say when reviewing Legally Blond is that the screenwriter(s) for the movie are more talented the Ms Brown. I liked the book on some levels. The plot kept me interested but the writing was not exactly wonderful. At the first page I realized this and wondered if it would be the same the whole way through. It was. The only way to describe the writing is as slightly childish. Even though parts of it were good I could not recommend it. (To all those reading this who loved the book sorry. I always get really angry when someone bashes a book I loved).
4,Great Read for the Beach,The book isn't very long- perfect to take to the beach or to read while waiting in the airport. Light and funny literature. Recommend for a college student looking a Chick-flick novel:)
1,Still can't get over how bad it was,"I really liked the movie so I bought the book, figuring I'd like it just as much, if not more. WOW, I could not have been more wrong. The writing in the book was absolutely horrible. After an OK beginning, I thought it could only get better, but it only got worse. Elle stays stupid throughout the book, not passing law school because she buckles down (as in the movie) but because someone else is feeding her the answers. Most of what made the movie good wasn't even in the book - I'm guessing the producers saw what could be a good idea - a girl follows her boyfriend to law school - and really improved on it. I seriously do not understand why there are any good reviews here - my guess is that they know the author. There's no other excuse for it. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this book! The writing is flat and dull and a lifeless plot keeps it flat on the ground."
2,Terrible Writing!,"I read this book thinking it would be as cute and funny as the movie, but to be honest, I could barely get through it. The characters are shallow and unbelievable as people, and the dialouge is so fake I cringed at everything the characters said. Some people might like this book because of it's Girl Power message, but I was so distracted by the terrible writing that I couldn't concentrate on the message it was trying to convey."
3,Just plain not as good as the movie,"Okay, so I'm not even a fan of this genre of movie or book, but hey, I did like the Reese Witherspoon movie. Fluffy, yes, but still entertaining, and so I figured I'd read the book it was based on.Well, there are few points to the book not in the movie. However, the characters, all of them, seem much shallower than they seemed in the movie. Not so much shallow in the author's portrayals, but more just shallow people with some intelligence, but little emotional depth to their characters. As a book that appeals to younger women, I sure would have liked to have seen more awareness of values."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This is the worst book I've ever read.In fact, it seemed so far from the movie I checked the dates and there is no way the movie was based on this book. The movie came out in 2001 and this book wasn't even first printed until 2003!Don't waste your time or your money on this stupid piece of trash."
3,The movie was better...,"I saw the movie, Legally Blonde before I read the book and I think that the movie was better and a lot funnier. The book is kind of boring, and I dont know if its because I already know the story or not. Dont buy it, check it out from your local library."
1,Elle is [not nice]in this book!,"I decided to read Legally Blonde after seeing the movie. I loved the film, I thought Reese Witherspoon did a great job playing the kind of girl everyone loves to hate, who is actually really a nice, sweet girl. I thought the book would be like that. It's not.Elle is the kind of girl you just plain hate. At least, the kind I hate. Not only is she perfect, I think she kind of knows it, too.I'm just about finished with the book, but I'm not sure if I'll actually finish it, Elle just pisses me off so much. I read that Amanda Brown based the novel on her own experiences in law school. If Ms. Brown is anything like Elle in the book, she's probably [not nice], too."
2,Helicopter,"I purchased this helicopter for my sons school project and it worked out well for him. This product was very delicate, had to be careful handling it because the pieces would break off easy."
5,Books for Young Students with Puerto Rican Heritage,"I bought this book for a student of mine with Puerto Rican heritage. He loved having Spanish on one side and English on the other. He was not an avid reader, but he loved this book so much that he read it in a week or so."
1,Disappointed,"These shoes were ordered for an event I was to attend and when they arrived I was so happy to open the box...until I opened the box to see that I was sent a size 10 when I ordered an 8 1/2, to top it off, the 8 1/2 that I ordered apparently went to someone else and it was the last one. I am very disappointed in Amazon and will not be ordering shoes again."
5,Dick and Jane where the best!,I didn't think i'd ever see Dick and Jane again. This book is great. I loved reading about them. There are stories from the readers that I still remember. And would like to read all the books over again. What are the chances of seeing the original stories again?
3,I truly hope some of the commentary was satirical...,"...but fear, in this day when psychobabble, family values, and the like are taken far too seriously, the ""American Dream"" as related to Dick and Jane is as well.Most of us ""Depression Era through Baby Boom"" kids (I'm the latter) can enjoy some memories of the Dick and Jane we knew so well in first grade. But anyone whose memory is keen enough will know that the ""Dick and Jane"" family were hardly those we'd have wished to imitate. The kids apparently had no friends (though the book shows that, after ""my time,"" they did acquire a few); were not terribly bright; hardly had a decent conversation (remember story one: ""Oh, Look!""?); their prime concern seemed to be ""helping mother,"" and they might have been an adult's dream (never caused trouble, and so forth) but were not a fellow kid's."
4,so far so good,"Very cheap, and so far so good! Replacement battery in the store was $30 and this one was about $6... can't beat that."
2,But at least it's cheap,"If you live in a warm climate and only want to take 3-5 pictures a day this is for you as long as you charge it every night. If you're in a cold climate you might get 1 or 2 if it was charged the night before. If it sits in a cold vehicle for 2 days without a charge don't bother even trying, it's dead."
4,Good battery for old camera,This battery was cheap enough to buy so I can revive my old camera. I actually bought two of these little guys and so far they have worked well. The price was great and shipping was fine.LouisNelson
3,"Good,but not enough info on adolescent narcissism.","This is a largely anecdotal book that does cover the behaviors and perceived reasons that contribute to these disorders. It was easy to read by a layman like myself, but failed to address the specific question I had in mind. This is particularly frustrating because I spoke to Dr. Masterson on the phone about this problem (adolescent clinical narcissism) and was assured that it did. Everything else is very well covered except this one subject. It is an interesting book that gives insight while helping to understand practical solutions to dealing with a person who exhibits one of these disorders."
5,Great information; not light reading,"I'm about half way through the book now. It's definitely not light reading, and I'm probably going to have to read it another couple of times to really get it. But the information it contains seems to be both profound and very useful/helpful. I definitely recommend it."
2,not sure what the point was,"While there were some interesting tidbits in this book, it was mostly a disorganized mess with no actual point. There are many much better written books on the subject."
5,Filled with interesting little stories,"Rosen begins with Col Tim Spicer and the development of modern PMCs. He follows with fascinating accounts of famous battles fought by mercenaries over 2,500 years. Finally he returns to the use of PMCs in current conflicts.I must disagree with the last reviewer. The book is not unfriendly to Col Spicer. Rosen clearly differentiates between the mercenaries who are less savory and those who are more admirable. Spicer is credited for bringing formal guidelines and principles to the modern mercenary world.It was hard to put this book down at night. That is not common for a book that I learn so much from."
1,TYPO Central,"So far this book has good info, but when there are so many typos that it is almost hard to understand, thats ridiculous. What did this guy pay his publishing company for. it hurts how many typos there are."
1,DON'T UPGRADE!,"I used to LOVE Quicken but upgraded to 2004 Basic to take advantage of free offer with Turbo Tax. They shouldn't even give this product away. It is garbage! Full of bugs! Can't load ""budget"" on toolbar because it won't be there next time I get on but others work. Data was corrupted in transfer. Constant crashing when customizing. Crashes every backup. It converted file types wrong then there is no way to fix. Support folks don't speak English. They want to charge $1.95 per minute to help with this awful software. To top it off, I didn't like the new format - especially the budget function. I was sick to my stomach after 8 hours of messing with it and having lost 15 years of data. Bought Quicken 2000 on e-bay since Intuit wouldn't sell or download it to me. Thank goodness my backup data was fine. Quicken 2000 is a great product. It's horrible that Intuit has done this to us."
1,The Worst Version of Quicken Yet!,"This software has gone from great in the 90's to terrible for the past few years. In 2004, there are NO OPTIONS for register colors - just all white. There are NO program color schemes. There is advertising at bottom that cannot be removed. While using splits, the error of not being able to open the category list, that appeared in the 2003 version, has not been fixed in 2004! BEWARE - files updated to 2003 or 2004 versions will not work on older, MUCH BETTER versions. You will be stuck with having to use the worst versions yet!"
1,Very very poor quality product,"I agree with the other reviewer. I had been a quicken user for a long time. Since I upgraded, I have had nothing but problems! Their program is buggy as heck and they make you pay for their garbage. I am looking into alternative programs as we speak. Do not waste your money on this product. The $24 some odd you may pay for the product is nothing compared to the technical support you will be paying!"
1,Intuit has lost the recipe,"As a devoted Quicken user since 1995, I was just a little annoyed when Intuit told me they would cut off my online access for Quicken 2000. I bought 2004 Basic thinking I might at least get some improvements. After using 2004 for a short time, I was shocked at both the reduction in ease of use and the many blatant bugs I encountered.In addition to the program being much slower and creating much larger files (slower backups), simple operations like copy/paste of investment transactions are no longer available. The worst part is the bugs. They can't even manage their windows correctly with some getting stuck in background or foreground. I've also had several program lockups. The help files, which in 2000 offered some explanation, now yield absolutely no new information over the dialogs they purport to help with.This software is a total disaster. I reinstalled my 2000 and will do without online service."
2,Stick with Quicken 2001,"I've been a Quicken user since 4.0, and this 2004 version is awful (I upgraded from 2001). The new program is hard to use. I wish there was a way to convert back to 2001. Also, technical support via Chat is awful; the end conclusion for every problem is that you have to reinstall the software."
2,Diminishing returns with Quicken program,"As a user of Quicken since 1991, I am surprised and appalled at the poor quality of each year's subsequent version. One has no choice but to upgrade, since the earlier, more stable versions will no longer be supported. Important, simple features, such as right-click pasting in the checkbook, are now unavailable. Intuit is more interested in selling you mortgage services and providing car loans than the ongoing development of what was once the best financial software package on the market."
2,Less for more,"I too was forced to upgrade from Quicken '99 and did so begrudgingly. When I received my copy of Quicken Basic '04 I realized that much of the functionality (downloads of stock prices, etc.) of my old Quicken Basic was now only available in Quicken Deluxe for an additional $20. I returned my Quicken '04 and will continue to use my '99 version, even if I have to input daily stock prices by hand."
1,quicken 2003,"I have been using quicken since the 90's. The bestQuicken was the 99 version. Since that time they havebeen going down. I was going to order the 2004 but afterreading the reviews, I'm not ordering it. Have these reviewsbeen given to Quicken so they know how awful their producthas become. If they appreciate their customers, they willdo something to change their software. Thanks!"
1,Quicken forces users to upgrade,"Very dissatisfied Intuit forces users to upgrade software to retain the existing service levels. This is due to their ""discontinuation policy"", which ironically will force me to discontinue being their customer. I will not upgrade."
1,Worst Version of Quicken ...........EVER!!!!!!!,"I have used Quicken since the DOS versions, this one is the worst! You cannot change any colors, period, end of discussion! You cannot remove unused, useless toolbars/frames, period, end of discussion! You will have to call tech support! You will have to endure repeated uninstalls/reinstalls! Download a trial version before you upgrade, if you can't configure it the way you want, delete it and move on!"
1,Thank you for the warnings,"I was all set to upgrade to Quicken 2004. The only reason? So I could make backup files easier by burning to cd's. I too, have used Quicken for many years and would upgrade every other year. Well, after reading all the reviews, I think for the time being I will stick with my 2002 version. I can still backup on cd's the long way around. What can these companies be thinking of when they cheapen their products, hire people who can't speak with you for support, etc.Thank you all for the warnings. I believe my money will be better spent somewhere else."
4,Good for preachers,I have been using this book as a sermon resource for several years now and have used quite a few of the anecdotes throughout the book. I especially appreciate the in-depth index which guides me to the topics I need. It made me purchase Hodgin's other two compilations.
2,Don't care much for this expansion,"First let me say that I love Gloom and some of the other expansions. However, this expansion makes the game fairly complicated and pretty unbalanced if you have less than 6 players playing (requires other expansions as well). Most of the other expansions work great even if you only have 3-4 players, so I'd suggest getting one of the others first."
3,Very confusing directions,"My 36 year old son, my 42 year old son-in-law, and I found this game's directions to be extremely complicated and confusing. It was purchased for my 13 year old grandson. We haven't given up yet since so many of the reviews say how much fun it is. But I am wondering if the people who write the instructions have played the game."
2,meh,"The card game in theory is a nifty one, however some of the rules are wonky, and it doesn't work well with fewer than 4 players. It actually works better with all other boosters added to the main deck with 6-8 people playing which on most days is hard to do."
5,Awesome! 6 Stars!,"This is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. If you enjoy western shoot'em ups this is th' game fer you! Great storyline unlike most games(Quake). Almost everyday I pop this game into my Cd player and start shootin.Not only is the game great but there is multiplayer. others.A great website for playin outlaws in www.zone.com look around and become a member! Great! And once ya get bored playin th' Multiplayer levels on the cd, you can download many levels that other people have made! Not only is the game awesome the people around it are great. Hopefully Lucasarts will make a sequel. But before you buy that, get this it's well worth it and at a great price! Great Website to download more Multiplayer"
5,Outlaws,"This is by far ""THE BEST VIDEO GAME EVER MADE"". I bought it in 1997 and still love to play and design new levels for it today in 2000. I cannot understand why Lucas Arts refuses to make a sequel to this game. It has almost a cult following on the web. There are many Outlaws websites and fans all over the world. You can play the Main Game (which is a great story), or you can go bounty hunting in the Historical Missions, or you can play against real live opponents or friends over the internet or modem. You can also download a level editor called LawMaker from the internet and create your own levels, which is almost as fun as playing the game. The game is easy to use, has some nice configuration options, and never crashes. Sure it is not flashy, sophisticated, or futuristic, but that is what makes it so great. If you want to have some good old fashioned fun, buy and play Outlaws.P.S. Wake up Lucas Arts and make a sequel to Outlaws instead of all of the Star Wars crap."
1,Outlaws,"Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west. The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan. Built on a dated engine with wonky physics, Dated graphics and a 2.5D design. Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI. Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies, Find key, Open door, Shoot more baddies, Find another Key ect ect. Outlaws is very dissapointing."
3,Less than I expected,"Though the packaging is very nice and everything is as in the picture, the scent is not the ""Sensuality"" that I expected. It's a little more earthy like patchouli which isn't exactly the scent I want rubbed all over in oil."
5,Great Riddims,"Very good dub cd put together by the masters at Guidance. It seems like you just can't go wrong with that label. Especially the Hi-Fi dub sessions, and this one is no different."
3,Gentle and effective,"Ive used many of similasan products, 2 other eye drops and the ear drops.Its very gentle and effective but it takes a while to work and it doesnt give that instant WABAMM relief like visine.I love organic stuff with less chemicals and strong ingrediants but sometimes we need heftier drugs that will work.Please look for japanese eye drops on ebay.They are shaped in a hexagon."
3,Doesn't really do anything,"It feels good when I put them in, and then it wears off kind of fast. To be honest, I think using this has made my eyes worse. I've been using eye drops pretty much every day for a little over 4 years so I kind of know what I'm talking about. Wont be purchasing this again"
1,Fraudulent.,These drops are simply overpriced water. Homeopathy is bullsh*te. I'm amazed its legal to lie and sell this crap. Science disproved homeopathy before the first car was invented.
2,Works but expires 7 days or something after opened!,If i known this expires a week after opening i would of not bought it! It might be earlier then 7 days not sure but i was pretty upset i wasted $8 to put drops in once! If they expire this short of a time make it little packets or something what a waste of a product.... I bought this thinking if it comes back i can use it again later and makes up for the high price. Also the box is also different what false advertising this product is! So much lies and hidden info not mentioned.
2,"horrible install manual, no customer support","I bought this unit and the manual is basically non-understandable with practically microscopic drawings of installation. Further, those instructions are both incorrect and misleading, both. Called Cust. Serv and they never got back to me. Fiddled with unit for a couple of hours and was able to install correctly. I have an engineering background and it still took some thought.Once you purchase unit and find you cannot install you are either left to try to figure it out yourself or return to store.Also, unit ac does not turn on unless an exact menu sequence is pressed. I guess this to be a hardwired logical procedure fault in the board. I think most people would discover this correct combo on their own. I think most people would be able to install without return but terribly inconvenient.Two stars only for quiet and cold.Mike in Missouri"
1,Compressor works but no freon in system 5 year warrany on sealed system where?,"Tried manufacture got hung up on then now told this is the old model the new one is like a aes3105. Frigeration Tech looked and turned on unit only saying it has a system leak or freon not installed, so it will not get cold. Now maybe because it's a older model we can not get a replacement from seller maybe because it was a older model setting around and thus reason for problem in the first place. Now I had a guy install unit modify window to fit their unit and can not get warrantied as maker only changes smaller units out. Seller will not replace with current model aes3105 even though unit they sold me is defective and non-functional couple years old according to maker of units. It will only blow warm air nothing close to cold with out freon. Maker said unit is a couple year older model and they will only exchange it a 4 week process in the middle of coming summer in OK. Sucks"
4,Staying cool,"The a/c itself is fantastic. Had some problems with how it was delivered though - it was missing the screws necessary for installation. After dealing with Haier customer service, I don't think I'll be purchasing any of their other products anytime soon. After almost a month, I received the screws - the wrong ones. I ended up installing it with some ingenuity and foregoing their instructions and lack of necessary parts. The a/c definitely cools the room, love the optional settings - only drawback is the noise but I happen to like it since it's installed in my bedroom and helps me sleep. The remote control is useless unless you are standing right in front of the a/c control panel - another drawback for some but I rarely change the setting so it's not much of a concern for me. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase as long as I don't have to deal with Haier's customer service department again."
2,Underwhelming,"We bought 2, 10,000 BTU A/c's to replace a 7500 and a 5000 for our home.You would think that this size A/C would cool quickly and efficiently....but no. It takes as long to cool the same space as the old ones did. One is actually quite noisy (like there's something in the fan).Hoping for a cool summer so that we don't need them too much!Should have known....you get what you pay for!! we DO like to remote controls though...for what that's worth."
2,Ridiculously Loud!!,"We bought this for our daughters room. It get's very hot in our upstairs during the summer. It is so outrageously loud I can't believe it. If you ever used an air compressor for in home construction; it sounds like there is one sitting in her room. Amazingly she seems to be able to sleep through it, but I don't know how."
4,Good enough,I knew that I am not buying air conditioner with all bells and whistles from top of the line manufacturer. And it met my average expectations.Pros.It works well. It worked for three months almost without breaks.Not much noise on low fan setting.Cons.It choked for few hours during 105 degree three-day heat wave. Had to turn it off for few hours.You have to turn it early in the morning when temperature is relatively low and it will keep comfortable cool temperature during the day. But if you turn it on when temperature is 90-100 degrees do no expect to cool it to 75 within an 2-3 hour. Will not work. It is not good for rapid cooling at all.
4,"It cools down nicely, but it is loud","It does cool down my huge room nicely, but it is much louder than I expected."
3,"great read, bad ending","I enjoyed this book, but found the ending disappointing enough that I probably won't read more books by this author. Keeping this comment vague to avoid any kind of spoiler: If you're going to write about people's experience of and response to great hardship, you should take the trouble to research it. Almost any reputable book, or even article or website, on a subject that suddenly crops up at the end, would have been enough to help the author avoid perpetuating a harmful stereotype -- one that that seems like it was brought in only to solve a plotting problem, and is second in over-use only to ""and then I woke up and realized it was all a dream."" That said, everything up to the last few chapters seemed well observed, well written, and enjoyable."
3,Good story but weak ending,"I really enjoyed this book until the ending. I just didn't buy the killer, and I found the climax to be contrived and unrealistic. This is a pet peeve of mine--anyone can write a great set-up, but an excellent writer MUST come up with a convincing, realistic ending.I also found several passages that were overly sentimental and maudlin. Not my cup of tea at all!Still, I liked enough about the book to try another of the author's books. However, if it also has these same weaknesses, then I'll move on."
5,"Love the ""snap"" and the story too","Both my 1 and 3 year old enjoy snapping along with the character and retain interested in the life-lesson story, as well. My 1 year old can often be found walking through the house trying to snap the head himself. A great addition to our library (we already own the Toucan book, also an excellent story)."
5,highly recommended,"The Annunciate is really an exceptional book because it combines a fascinating and original SF universe with complex characterizations that are problematic in our own world. Although I'm a fan of Nicole Griffith and other writers who emphasize gender issues, Severna Park assumes most of these issues as a starting point and doesn't shrink from the honest appraisal of the most anguished and perhaps insoluable dilemmas in personal relationships among any gender. While this book is well worth reading simply for the surface fiction, I find its underlying psychological aspect to be its most fascinating aspect."
2,Insubstantial...,"Here's a story with a potentially great premise, a society stratified into three castes largely by virtue of their access to technology... but the story really never goes there. The society acts as a canvas backdrop on a stage that consists of one actor, three cardboard cutout characters, an alien, and a few assorted props.The story was not compelling, the heroine seems (in a nutshell) to go out and get into trouble and then watch what happens. The supporting characters were ill-defined and generally unlikeable. The alien was kind of neat but really a stretch on the suspension-of-disbelief. Everyone and everthing else was just paint on the background. The story had a couple of mildly tense moments, but I cared so little about the characters that even those moments were largely uninteresting.It's readable but if I didn't own it, I wouldn't go out and buy it."
3,"engaging, but somehow lacking","The premise of this book was very interesting, and also a thought-provoking look at the story of the Garden of Eden and the Fall. The author created a very believable universe with all its problems and castes, the haves and have-nots. It was easy to get sucked in to the main character's life and her feelings of hopelessness, hopefulness, desire and more. It was also a very engaging book - I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened... However, the ending was disappointing. I thought - is that it? I want more!I would recommend reading Suzy McKee Charnas ""Walk to the End of the World"" instead of this one."
1,Don't let the low price fool you,"This album was a big disappointment. I saw this band playing in lower Manhattan twice. Surreal puts on a solid show. They weren't able to capture their live energy on this album, at all. The production is weak, and without the energy of their live performance you quickly realise what these songs aren't: good.Save your 9 bucks and go see em' live. They're playing better material than this now."

3,Good early Wodehouse,PG writing about the scouts early in his (Wodehouse's) career is a very funny story. Not vintage Jeeves/Bertie nor Blandings but you can see Wodehouse starting to bloom.
4,A scholarly guide to increasing diversity,"Most Americans agree that discrimination is wrong. The U.S. population is an amazingly varied patchwork of people from every conceivable background and orientation. Nevertheless, widespread discrimination prevents members of racial minorities, as well as people of other classifications, such as women, disabled people, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, from realizing their full potentials at work. The recognition and celebration of diversity is essential to a smoothly functioning U.S. society. In this textbook, diversity expert Myrtle P. Bell explains that diversity is a strength, not a weakness. Employers who actively seek to create diverse workplaces benefit from doing so. getAbstract recommends this book to human resource managers and others who wish to promote workplace diversity and end discrimination."
1,"Numbers, numbers",This book doesn't make any sense. Its all numbers with a different scenario in each chapter. I had to buy it for a class and never used it.
1,Required Course Material,This book is poorly written with a lot of repetitive information page after page. It often lacks concise thinking and makes you go back to see if you accidentally missed a page. To top it off the binding came damaged from Amazon so I doubt I can sell it at the end of the semester.
4,airwaves remix,"It is important to preserve these Cambodian recordings as they were transmitted by radio but why was no effort made to acknowledge the original artists, who were prolific and well known?"
4,"good explanations, a bit long","Good discussions of the options families have to face. Sadly, even the most detailed ""advance directive"" doesn't cover all the possible situations, and a thoughtful, literate, concerned family will get a lot of help from this."
5,COOL BOOK!,"My mom just gave me this for an early christmas present and i read it at every chance i get! I got it because i cleaned our house. moms! they'll do anything to get you to do chores! but still, i love this almanac!"
4,good read!,"excellent book, easy to read, hard to put down gives a running history of development of custom rounds nd the background on various forms of the sport and equiptment required."
2,A Very Corny Mystery,"I can't believe that everyone else is writing about how great this book is! It is real cheesy and it's plot is pathetic. For example, one of the main characters loses his voice on a roller coaster from screaming so much, and then, about 6 hours later, he still can't talk when a murderer is chasing jim (Yeah, Right!). If you have to do required reading for school, this book is OK, but if you're just picking out a book to sit down and read for fun, DON'T pick this."
3,They Whisper,I couldn't get into this book. The man is obsessed by women and seems to think about nothing else. Then he does not love his woman and plays the suffering martyr. The only good thing I can say about it was his great love and sacrifices he made for his son. It is worth reading just for this part. But the sex is pretty routine and not what I consider erotica.
2,Clueless,"When Ira Holloway looks back on his life, he sees women. Lots of women. He professes love for all of them, and even tells us he is able to hear their innermost monologues tht emminate from their, uh... most private parts, hence the title. If this were not so silly, it might be interesting. Instead of the insightful, personal history Ira means his tale to be, we get something that ultimately sounds like the very well-written tales of a garden variety fetishest"
2,Loves women or himself?,"What I find particularly galling about this book is the claim that the protaganist loves and cherishes all women. If so, then why does he support prostitution, which is the debasement and subjugation of women? I almost gagged as I read about his numerous experiences with prostitutes. He seems to think that he was always the one john that they truly had feelings for. I wonder how many egotistical men who were told ""you're the best"" by a hooker actually believed it. Well, this one certainly fell for it hook,line and sinker. He also seemed to think that he could use his penis to save all womankind - spare me! I gave it two stars because there was some redeeming value to this mess. The storyline involving his wife was compelling."
1,Monterously self indulgent waste of time,"Synopsis of the plot: Misogynistic religious bigot spends a hundred and some-odd pages trying to convince the reader that he is not a misogynistic religious bigot.All in all, it has the same content, and roughly the same literary value, as an issue of Penthouse Forum. That's four hours of my life I'll never get back."
4,"Found it by chance, opened my eyes to male sexuality","I could not put this book down for a minute and I could not beleive that a male author could write so eloqently, sexually and emotionally, about his love for women. The novel was very moving and I'm looking for other books by Butler with erotic themes."
2,Skipping OVER the Dirty Parts,"The other reviews about this book are eloquently accurate. ""Whisper"" is an erotic novel about a man who claims to love women but the amateur Freud in me suspected early on that some of his obsession was PTSS from Vietnam. Maybe if I were younger, I'd have hung on every word, but eventually the sex -- lovely as it was -- bored me and, unfortunately, so did the relationship: alas, he couldn't be the savior she desperately needed and in fact may have made her worse. So -- I can't believe this!-- I skipped the dirty parts to see how it ended! However, the enthusiasm expressed by other reviewers for this writer's work impels me to try again."
4,Incisive,A lightly encapsulated narrative which speaks too truthfully of the pain many people I have known seem to feel. Lush and painful
1,**SIGH**,"You won't find a more excruciatingly boring novel anywhere. Butler, a Pulitzer Prize winner, could do better."
3,Obsessively obsessive?,"What I admire about the novel is the lyrical intensity of its (often successful) attempt to recreate erotic obsession. What I don't admire is a redundancy of detail and motif that often veers toward monotony. Scenery is well drawn (Southeast Asia, NYC, various rural outposts of the US) and dialogue is generally terse. Though plot is not a dominant element here, being subsidiary to image and tone, it's sometimes a bit formulaic, especially the end. It's worthwhile if you're a patient reader and enjoy psychic/linguistic convolutions."
4,the man who loved women,"butler is another louisiana writer i have come to appreciate. not many male writers can write female characters well...this guy is so good it, makes you wonder if he lives inside their heads...maybe he grew up in a house full of women?.....the dialog is excellent...and the female characters are as intriguing as the protagonist...some people griped about the glorification of prostitution...but it is a necessary evil...it's more honest for a guy to pay for sex, than it is for him to wine and dine a woman, giving her expensive gifts, to get her into bed with him....i thought fiona's story was excellent , yet sad...."
5,great writing by a male author in the voices of women,"Butler tells a great story here, as in all his books, but this one stands out for his best use of the language. It is quite erotic, but also bespeaks deep empathy with a beloved woman slowly going mad. An unusually successful attempt by a male author to hear women's thoughts."
2,Erotomania gone wild,"It's hard to read a book this narcissistic and obsessional without bursting out laughing. When he says ""they whisper,"" he's talking about the women's private parts. They talk to him. Seriously?Many of the reviewers seem to identify Butler as Ira, but I hope we're talking about a narrator, not a writer, because Ira seems to believe that his tumescent longings and fixations give him insight into the inner women with whom he is obsessed. I could forgive that in a character, but in a real man? Oh dear.He imagines that the women he pays for sex are as transported by the transaction as he is, despite the hardship and war that force them into the sex trade. And Fiona is a ridiculous, unbelievable character, a drawn-out nightmare that could never really exist, except as a way for a man to justify his withdrawal into fantasy over reality.The whole book is a fever dream and I just wanted to wake up."
4,"Fun, but not as big as I imagined","My 6 month old loves this, but I was very disappointed when I opened the box, it's a lot smaller than I imagined from looking at the picture, maybe they should show a picture of a baby holding it so you can see how small it is."
3,Kind of a Dud,"This is my daughter's LEAST favorite - I think I bought it when she was around 3-4 months old and even now at 8 months she really doesn't want anything to do with it. I'm not 100% sure what it is, but if I had to guess I would say that it's not very easy for a baby to hold. The ""nubs"" are crinkly but they are stuffed pretty tight and you can't really squeeze them. Plus the rubber tubing loops are just too narrow for small hands to grab. When you squeeze the ""whoozit"" face it does squeek, but a baby doesn't have the dexterity/strength to do that until they're older."
2,just not into it,"i thought baby would be much more interested in this. it's colorful and easy to grab -- but for some reason, it's a non-starter."
4,good for grabbing,"I got this for my daughter when she was 3 months old because her fingers were strong enough to grab things but not to hold on for very long. I play tug of war games with her with this. It is very soft so it is appropriate for even small babies, and it smushes up to fit in your diaper bag. Note that it is not really a ball -- if you want something that rolls, bounces, etc., you want something like the Oball."
1,Ski by this...Buy the Box Set and Save Time and Money,"Thought this would include more (and better) material from the Warren Miller films. Disappointed 90% of these thrills and spills were in the past movies and repeated in the box set I also bought. Even within this DVD it repeats the falls and skating on ice and chairlift pileups despite being split into two parts. Where's the continuation footage of those fantastic jumps and you can see the skier's head between their ankles and the clip ends? If you buy the box set, leave this one on the shelf. It's a pooper!"
3,Dated,"I used to love Warren Miller's movies. I grew in a ski town and they were on every video stores shelf. However there are so many well-done, blooper shows out there now that are more refined. I bought this to introduce WM to my kids (ages 6-10), whom I am just getting into skiing. Problems: 1.) They rarely laughed 2.)There were some inappropriate moments (2nd scene has bikini races, ""Family that skis...B1t@hes at each other"") and 3.) the two films share a lot of material so watched back to back is a little boring. Sorry Warren, but I think my next ski-film $ will be going to Greg S...I was hoping to show the kids somthing to get them excited about skiing the next day and I think all I did was remind them how old I am."
2,Not really the Best Of,"Being a big Warren Miller fan, I thought this would be a fun gift for my skiing husband. It wasn't up to any Warren Miller standard. It is two segments on one DVD and some of the clips are repeated from the first to second segment. Save your money and buy the boxed set. It has all of these sometimes lame clips plus good skiing and great mountain shots."
3,Warren Miller highlights,"Initially DVD was great. Very funny stuff. However, when you click on the second half of the DVD, about 5 minutes in it starts repeating the videos from the first half of the DVD."
3,average,I am a Warren Miller fan and always thought that his movies had funny moments. This DVD did not have the scenes which I remembered. It is average for entertainment value overall.
4,Gettin' down with Down Under,"Skank Down Under, for me, is one of the best collections I've ever heard. ""Coffee and Cream"" is my anthem and ""Now The Party's Over"" is the perfect ""morning after"" song. I urge anybody who craves ska and/or skank to get this CD."
5,"Delightful, Delicous, EASY!!!",I just bought this cookbook after a friend's recommendation. A novel concept! The book is divided into 3 flip sections...so you can open it up and BAM! you've got a great dinner menu. The instructions are so easy to follow and the author gives suggestions on which dishes to pair together. I love it!
2,Sadly dissappointed!,This device seemed like the perfect thing to strip insulation off of some wire that I had. It was hard to get it to stay on the center of the wire and the plastic piece at the bottom kept popping off. The tiny blade wears out quickly even if you set it were it doesn't touch the copper at all and at $5 a blade not worth it. A regular utility knife still beats this device!
3,"Great concept, but limited growth potential","Nitro Vision comes with four learning cartridges (Math Explorer, Language Launcher, Science & Nature Discovery, and Spanish). But what happens after a child has met these challenges (or simply tires of these 4 cartridges)?I have yet to see any additional cartridges available for this system. (As of 12/25/06). Hopefully the manufacturer will soon offer optional cartridges to add further challenges and keep it interesting.Also note that batteries are required since a power adapter is not included in this package either. This is overall a great concept that needs a bit of ""tweaking""."
3,Beware- The AC adapter isn't included,"I just bought this system for my 5 year old's birthday. I was surprised that the AC adapter wasn't included. You can, however, purchase 3 ""C"" batteries. I gave this system 3 stars because we haven't tried it yet. I will submit another review if it is worth changing the rating."
5,Great shojo manga,"I loved this book! Yoshizumi has a great plot for this series. It's fun to read...you can almost imagine yourself in the character's spot. The series is mostly a romantic comedy, so if you like that genre, you'll love this manga. I highly recomend it. Ja!"
4,The fountain is too large for my use,"The fountain is attractive but too large for my use so unfortunately, I have to return it. Be aware that the lowest setting on the pump is optimum; the highest setting will send water out past the edge of the bowl. Do not fill the bowl all the way with water; it must be below where the cord feeds out the back or you will have water coming out that opening.Customer service and responsiveness is outstanding."
5,Flight- Allow your mind to take a journey.,"Flight, by Steve La Cerra is a masterpiece. It is the thinking man's Yanni, and the feeling man's Tesch. If you are a fan of quality ""New Age"" music, Flight is your salvation. Flight is New Age with an attitude."
3,Nice bag for the money,"overall good bag, was looking for something to take camping near a creek. This will work but I also purchased a Sealine dry bag. Comparing Sealine to Kwik Tek Dry Pak, Sealine has better construction, materials and quality."
2,"Durable bag, but the clasp broke the 2nd time using it","We bought the bag to take on a canoe trip. Despite the fact that it ""seals"" by just rolling up the top and then closing the clasps, it does NOT leak and will float with plenty of stuff in it.The second time we took it out on a canoeing outing, though, the plastic clasp broke. Luckily we had some rope with us that we rolled up with the top of the bag and secured it closed by tying the rope ends together.If you buy one, have some rope handy, just in case..."
3,Not Really Clear and Kind of Bulky,"Ordered this bag to take with me while kayaking. It arrived on time so that was good but it's not really clear as shown in the picture. The whole bag is covered with little translucent squares so it's difficult to see thru -- Also, it's a little more bulky than I expected. It rolls up nicely - haven't tested it to see if it's really waterproof. For the price, I guess it's OK."
4,Good,"I bought this bag 'cause in the picture look like clear bag, but it isnt like that!!! the bag have squares in all the wall and u can't see behind that...In other way, it's good looking and it's made in good material."
5,Worked great for me.,"Used this bag on a one day white water trip. I was able to put two full size towels, a camera, wallet, purse, keys and an extra change of clothes for two people in this bag. Everything stayed dry. It was nice to be able to see through the bag when digging for items. I will be using it many times in the future I am sure."
5,Great Product,"Product was exactly as described, Heavy duty material that holds up. Will definitely keep things dry!"
5,This book changed my life.,"At a time when nothing seemed pissible, I desperatelly searched for ""motivation"". My soul was willing, but my flesh was defeated. It seemed as if nothing could get through to me. This book reached that stubborn, defeated side of me that was crippling me. Part of it was that I trusted this book with all my heart. During that time I trusted no one, so I searched for help in a book. I could not of come to a better work! This book turned my life around! Again and again, following the steps that this book inspires has led me to much success in climbing the Navy's rank structure and also in my personal relationships. This book has God's Blessing and will reach and enpower anyone who picks it up. I just thank God for using George Shinn to lift me out of the deepest valley I've ever been in. It is very clear that the Lord Jesus Christ worked through this book to help me. Back then I did not know Christ, but George Shinn did."
3,Not his best,"MY 3 1/2 year old son and I are great fans of Ralph. This is the third album of his that we have purchased, and feel that Happy Lemons pales in comparison to the other two. Some of the songs (Sammy the Dog, Barnyard Blues) are two fast for my son to follow the words and hence difficult for him to sing along with. Also Dinosaur Rumble which I had high hopes for seems depressing. If you want a great dinosaur song, listen to Laurie Berkner's ""We are the Dinosaurs"". It seemed to me that Ralph was trying to get another album out quickly to capitalize on his previous success. I hope he takes a little more time and care before putting the next one out."
5,Science Fiction? Fantasy? Excellent either way,"Speaking as a middle grade teacher, I want to recommend this superlative book. Even reluctant readers will be drawn into this deceptively simple tale about a boy on a quest. It seems to be fantasy, but the reader comes to realize through subtle clues that it is actually set in a realistic far future. Beautifully symbolic, exciting, humorous, moral, it is a must for any school library--or personal library"
4,Best House compilation I have ever heard,"This CD is truly worth getting if you are a fan of house and other electronic music genres. The album is very diverse, from club style music to chillout (lounge) type. Junior Sanchez's work is truly ear candy."
1,Instrumental -- ignore the pornography that comes with it.,"It is good music, although it is all instrumental. Ohh, and try to ignore the pornography that comes with it. Overall, I didn't like the CD at all!"
5,Great for the money and way better than Apple's,"I inherited an iPod from my son when he bought a new one. The headphones were shorted out at the jack, so I needed a new pair. My GF had the Sennheiser MX300 so I tried them and they sounded pretty good. But when I saw these white MX500 I thought I would give them a shot. The cord is longer then the MX300 which I really liked and it's white, so it matched the iPod. I have had a real problem getting earbuds to stay in my ear. These stay in pretty well; better than any others I have tried. The sound is better than the MX300 and way better than Apple's stock earphones. Crisp highs and very good bass. They seem to put out more volume, but that may be because that fit my ears better. Add the tiny slider volume control and what more can you ask for considering the price?"
3,"Okay, but not impressive","I use these headphones for my IPod Nano and they are alright, but I liked the original ones that Apple supplied a little bit better. The Sennheisers do not fit my ears as well (and came without cushions, unlike advertised by the picture on Amazon), and the adjustable volume on the cord sometimes provides for unwanted fluctuations in volume. Especially when working out this can be annoying. As far as sound quality goes, they are as good as the original IPod headphones. Still, next time I have to buy new headphones I might try a different pair."
4,"Great sound quality, but silly design","Great, crisp, full Sennheiser sound in a small package. I am using this on my 20GB Creative Zen Touch and my HP laptop, sounds way better than the included Creative earbuds on both devices. Can't really go wrong for the price.The design of the earbuds? Okay, well there's this carrying case that's included, and it's sort of half wind-up, half take-it-out-and-completely-give-up-and-get-it-into-a-tangled-mess-anyway. I have a set of Javo eBuds for my cell phone and I love the windup design of these and wish the Sennheisers were similar. The cord is too short. There are also no foam ear pads included, minor annoyance.Overall: Great set of earbuds, love the sound quality, but I would gladly pay more if anyone out there has something without such a thoughtless design."
1,Much less than I expected from Sennheiser,"Poor sound, poor quality. I wouldn't bother.I used them once and put them in the drawer.Unfortunately, I also bought and gave the pair as a gift."
4,"Great audio, great feel","I'm on my second pair of these Sennheisers and love them. The audio is great, and they're gentle on the ears as long as the foam covers stay in place. The case keeps the cable from tangling which is a nice feature. My only suggestion would be for Sennheiser to supply additional foam covers, as you'll probably lose one of them soon or later."
5,Very good,"Very beautiful earphone and with excellent music quality.But one picture of this product on amazon was ipod, not sennheiser. There are words for that picture but I didn't see it and make a purchase because of that picture---read carefully before you decide."
2,nice looking but poor quality,"Just bought, I used it for a business fly. The plastic ""protection"" beside a wheel is already broken !... after a single ""airport test"". I am desappointed by the Delsey quality ... actualy, where was this bag manufactured ?..."
3,Good but not as sturdy,"I was really pleased with the size and all the compartments. But, I recently traveled over seas and had very little in the duffle and it tore on the one end. The handles on either end don't seem to be secured in a way that would prevent this. Overall it worked well and made it through 3 countries :)"
3,Supersized,"The book is not without merit, and as pulp fiction goes is fairly well written. The characters are believable, in their cartoonish way, and the plot is thick with action.The inevitable comparison with ""Confederacy of Dunces"" shows how different these books are. Where Toole uses a hot dog cart, Shteyngart calls on Haliburton, graphic sex, mass murder and heavy stereotyping. The beauty of Toole's world is Ignatius's hilarious aplomb, his inability of being anyone but himself. He and the main characters make up their world out of their colorful disposition.""Absurdistan"", on the other hand, is constructed of labels (""Jew"", ""Haliburton"" or ""New York"" are expected to impress by their very appearance on the page). The book has its moments of elegance, but overall relies on labels to bedazzle. The supersized Misha lives in the world of supersized words, supersized images and supersized events, all of which left me feeling supersized."
2,not good.,"Ugg. This book annoyed me endlessly. The author seems smarmy and self-satisfied and it comes through on every page. I read ~30 books in 2007, and this is the one I liked least. Gets 2 stars only because the author has a flair for playing with language."
2,Largely disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book after reading one of the chapters published in The New Yorker, but I have to agree with another reviewer that that was the best part of it! The potential for satire is bottomless, but the author does not explore it. I am a Russian immigrant of the same generation as the author, so I can relate to and understand many of his references to Russian language, slang etc., but I can imagine that being difficult for American readers. Apart from a few lucky passages, the book is not funny, and I am hard pressed to find any satire, clever or otherwise. In my mind I pictured the author as an American Pelevin, but was disappointed. After reading the piece in the New Yorker and seeing the book in the top ten books in the NYT, I gave it as a gift without reading it and am now ashamed about it. This is the second time after The Emperor's Children that I am wondering about criteria of all those 'top' lists...."
1,Absurdistan=Absurd,"I guess I'm not intellectual enough to ""get"" this book. I don't understand why this book was so highly praised. I found nothing of interest in any of the characters and the main character disgusting. I can usually complete any book I start,but it was a relief to make the decision to quit wasting my time. I read all the great reviews and this book sounded like something I would like. Unfortunately I didn't check the negative reviews. I wish I had."
3,A book for fatties,"I thoroughly enjoyed the exploits and thoughts of a true slovenly obese anti-hero. As he made his way from post-communist Russia to a fantasy country, his encounters with bureaucracies and over-inflated characters were often hilarious. My belly laughs were of the size of his stomach. Absurdistan is a book to set aside reality and just let yourself ripple with laughter and even an occasional ""ah ha.""Ron Lealos author of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
4,"""Absurdistan"" in 20 Words","Vulgar, profane, hilarious.A Confederacy of DuncesmeetsStill Life with Woodpeckerin a post-Soviet dystopia. Plus: white men rap!"
3,A tough read,Mr. Shteyngart has assembled quite a few interesting characters in this novel. Perhaps that is the problem as they go through several adventures at times the story line seems to bog down. At other times the pages fly by.Read at you own risk.
2,Class assignment,It was required for class. I bought the book. I wrote my report. I threw the book in the trash.
2,Unimpressed,"I thought that this book would have a ""Borat"" sense of humor, strange and intriguing characters, but it did not. I could barley get through the 1/2 of it that I read."
2,"Absurdistan - Great potential, but ...","This book had wonderful potential, but falls short because the foul language and obsession with useless sexual references. The ending especially falls flat. The abrupt ending leads me to believe that the author needed to make a publishing deadline.Great concept, tasteless imagery, and horrible conclusion.The author has great credentials and wonderful potential, maybe the third one will be the ticket."
2,cliche,"Couldn't finish reading the book - as a Russian, I find it to be trite and cliched, characters lacking imagination. It sounds as if the author just found a few generic trends and stuck to each person, without thinking too much - the rich daddy, the hooker with the heart of gold, the spoilt rich brat.But that by itself would have been fine, had the writer not positioned himself as a ""Russian"". Instead, he lacks deep understanding of Russia, its culture and people. One example is his use of Russian curses. I find his overuse of Russian slang and curses to be extremely offensive - no real reason why almost twice per page the writer puts in these words in his text - they may sound interesting to a foreigner, but to a Russian this is extremely unpleasant to read.Overall - I stopped reading this ""book"" midway, and hope that the author refrains from writing anything else."
3,Funny easy read,"I've read both the Debutante and the Absurdistan. Both are fine easy reads. This book only gets funnier if you know something about the Russian emigrante community in NY.I'd recommend it if you are looking for some light reading. This is definitely a R-rated novel, so keep it in mind before you give it a gift to someone."
2,He only thinks he's clever,"Snore. As you read the book, you could care less for the character. The author makes it quite obvious when you're supposed to laugh at his clever and wit. It's so obvious and self-congratulating. He also likes to use the same type of joke throughout the whole book - maybe a small smile at the beginning but it only gets worse. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. I bought mine at an airport without the luxury of reading some of these reviews first. Darn it! By the way, another reader liked this to Sandler, don't think so. I think Adam Sandler is usually funny. This to me is nothing like Sandler."
4,Funny satire,"One of my favorite novels of the past few years. This comic romp by Gary Shteyngart takes place in a degraded post-Soviet world, where all anyone cares about is making money. The book is narrated by Misha Vainberg who dreams of returning to New York, where he was a student. Though a Russian heir to a fortune, he considers himself a lost American, trapped in corrupt country.To get back to the United States (and the love of his life), he travels to the Caucasus republic of Absurdistan. He hopes to get a visa there. Along the way he joins in epic bouts of drinking and conspicuous consumption, as the nouveau riche show off their wealth with huge bounties of caviar, vodka and prostitutes.It's a very funny satire that would be of interest to anyone who likes complex, richly detailed novels about our absurd world."
3,Split Personality,"The first third of the book is involving. I loved the descriptions of St. Petersburg, and New York. Unfortunately, the hero then flies to a fantasy country that seems to embody every cliché you've ever heard about the Middle East. Kalashnikovs, oil, random killings -- the incidents pile on top of each other, the hero constantly wringing his hands. It's not funny: it's pastiche."
4,Seriously Funny,"This is, at times, a densely written book, with joke after joke, some of them slapstick, others self-referential and not obvious to anyone not well read. If you liked Zadie Smith's ""White Teeth"" then you will enjoy this novel.The book goes on perhaps too long and the ending lacks the emotional impact or humorous outcome needed for this to be truly successful. But laugh for laugh this one is hard to beat."
5,"Orignial, Absurd and Highly Entertaining","I was a couple of years late to this novel because I completely misunderstood the premise (don't ask what I thought it was about). I found a copy on a friend's coffee table, and remembered the good reviews I had read. After browsing the first two pages I was hooked.Shteyngart has woven a rollicking, hilarious and original tale that I found highly entertaining. He writes with the tone and style of Sam Lypsyte, but with a more structured story. He brings a Russian immigrants perspective to Western culture with sometimes insightful and always funny results. Behind all the humor, is a strangely sympathetic character and well crafted story that is well worth reading."
3,Satire like a ton of bricks,"Notable book of the year notwithstanding, I just couldn't get through ""Absurdistan""--and I love parody and satire. I read the first 100 pages or so, but the initially amusing hero quickly became boring, and the grossness was piled on a little too thick for my taste. After awhile, I felt as if scenes started repeating--we hear of the hero's raptures over Ruenna, and a hundred pages later, hear of them again--but over a different girl. There are too many thieving Russians and bumbling bureaucrats in the book for my taste--one or two would have gotten the point across. I just had to cry ""Uncle"" and leave it unfinished. Perhaps I should try the first book?"
2,This went nowhere,"After reading so much about the book in the NYT, i was hoping it would pick up at some point, however it didn't. Even at the end when you think it may, it still falters... Sorry, spend your time reading something else."
1,Inflicted upon me by my book group.,"Dreck. No, DRECK! Ok, I am being harsh. It is only moronic drivel. Saddly, because of this effort I will never, ever, go near any other book (past or future) by Gary Shteyngart. There are too many great authors and great works waiting."
1,A New York Times Book of the Year?,"How this book made the New York Times list of 100 Best Books of 2007 is way beyond me! It is an absurd book with Misha, a very strange ""hero"" telling the story. The only redeeming quality of the book is the plot about the ""powers that be"" in Absurdistan trying to get time on CNN and their plan for doing this."
1,My One Star Rating is Two Stars Too High,"What a gosh-awful waste of time reading this claptrap was. It is, at best, juvenile, self-aggrandizing, pompous, culturally insulting, pretentious and complete drivel. As far as being a NYT top 10 book, the most feasible explanation for this is that the author must have a family member on the book review staff. You're better off spending your precious reading time doing something else more entertaining, like going to the dentist or mucking out horse stalls. I should know by now that a book with so many ""high-brow kudos"" like Absurdistan has must be a real stinker. Please don't waste your time. Heinous."
1,If Adam Sandler were a Book,"If the typical Adam Sandler movie were a book, you'd have Absurdistan. This is a horribly written, vacuous, at times boring book. If you like Adam Sandler's humor, you might like this book, but then again if you like Sandler's humor, you probably can't read."
4,Better than okay....,"Shteyngart may have taken a bite much too large to chew. The novel deals with so much -America, New York, love, oil, the current state of Russia, foreign policy, socioeconomics, Israel, hip hop as a suburban phenomena and much more- that it ultimately becomes an overwhelming work that Shteyngart doesn't attempt to truly complete. That is besides the point, as an authors intentions can never be presumed. A reader's desires, however, are to be expected. Ultimately, it doesn't all work. With his gifts as writer, Shteyngart still manages to write a funny, intelligent and readable novel. Not near a classic, but fun."
2,I guess I'm not qualified,"This is one of those books reading fans are supposed to like. Critics gave it glowing reviews and it was featured as a notable book of the year for the NYTimes. Unfortunately I found it uninteresting and boring. Plus the main character Misha flat out annoyed me and I was hoping for him to get blown up.I must be missing something or not qualified to read this novel, but to me it an excersise in trying to hard."
4,Mayhem with a manservant,"This is a funny, interesting, and relevant book. Russia under Putin suffers, but so do we Americans. Misha the bear is an unlikely protagionist, but blended with the Hyatt whores and errant Armenians, surely most of us will chuckle at many of his challenges. It is a very good read."
1,"Interesting concept, VERY shallow execution","This novel probably sounded great when Shteyngart was first thinking through the setting and the characters. Even the core plot likely seemed interesting when it was loosely outlined.Unfortunately, that was likely the last time any real thinking happened in the course of executing this novel. The characters are two-dimensional and the plot is trivial. It seems to want to be a broad indictment of globalism, capitalism, and turn of the century greed. Unfortunately, it fails.I am always a bit piqued when a book is as over-hyped as this and executes poorly. Like the ""Rule of Four"", this is just a simplistic book with a cool setting. It is not a good book."
2,Not good.,"For some reason, modern writers think if they are really vulgar that somehow this makes them great intellectual writers. The author of Absurdistan takes this approach. His main character is thoroughly disgusting with no real redeeming qualities. The author describes in detail the protagonists' private areas and events associated with it as well as his bowel movements, sexual encounters, eating and drinking habits of this grossly overweight man. Even worse the story does not really go anywhere. When the book finally finished I was like well that was pointless.The one redeeming factor of the book is it gives a pretty interesting portrayal of some Russian and NY cultural phenomenon and the interaction between the two. Not recommended unless you are a hardcore Russophile, and even then its not your best bet."
2,Totally cliche and uninventive,"I was quite disappointed in this Shteyngart follow up. Not nearly as funny, clever, witty, or original as his debut. I think he needs to come up with some novel ideas instead of ripping himself off, and badly!"
2,"Wonderful & Witty? C'mon, now!","So here you have a silly novel by a Wannabe Vaudevillean, it would seem, inventring a grossly obese anti-hero who somehow is irresistable to Latina and Russian nymphomaniacs. Wearing the armor of ""silly me"" charicature, he proceeds to insult all ethnicities, but reserves his principal villification for the ""Golly Burton"" subsidiary KBR, supposedly attempting to obtain an (actually illegal) cost-plus U.S. LOGCAP contract to support a future American invasion of a hypothetical Orthodox Christian tribal country squeezed between the Moslem nations of the Caspian Sea litoral, a place supposedly with exhausted energy resources. Fairly good writing, but a nonsensical plot. Better luck next time."
1,has racist meanings?,"i purchased the buckle for my 14yr. old grandson who wore it to school, because the top of flag poked his stomach he tucked his t-shirt in and the teachers wrote him up as being racist.wearing the confederate flag with rebel on the buckle my grandson as i were not aware the buckle had a different meaning than southern pride dipicting the civil war of years gone by.i believe evil is in the eyes of the beholder but there is so much crap going on in the schools,it seems fault can be found with anything you wear or say if it offends some one.this is beyond my understanding.my grandson is native american/lebanese/white so racist don't fit his coloring. we liked the product but it opened a whole attitude about him wearing it so it is a collectable now not a symbol of hatred.why can't the human race just get along???"
5,"Well, I have only played one of the games",I have only played one of these games that I bought in a single pack: Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.It is possibly the greatest game I have played.
4,Labor Pains is a Hoot!,"Lindsey L is not my favorite actress, but she really was quite hilarious in this well written and stylish film. I really enjoyed the story and really laughed at a number of scenes, especially the birthing class scene. The supporting cast is suburb and Cheryl Hines is particularly hilarious. Chris Parnell is very strong and the setting is true LA at its best. I particularly loved the sound track and story line. I am now a fan of Lindsey's and highly recommend this fun film for any group of expecting women looking for a laugh."
3,O.k. But not that funny.,"The problem here is that if you go in thinking this movie is going to be slapstick comedy, it's not. The comedy is very low key. Somebody mentioned the humor was like Working Girl which I agree. There are no belly laughs here. If you watch the movie with that mind set, it's an o.k. movie, but it seems more serious than funny. T.C."
4,Better than Expected - A decent comedy.,I was given this as a gift and I had low expectations of this movie because of the drama surrounding LL's private (not so private life). Well this movie is much better than I thought it would be. The plotline is decent and I found myself routing for her character. It is a light comedy that works and is an easy watch and the movie movies along at quite a decent pace. To some it up do yourself a favour and give this movie a chance you will not regret it.
4,Okay,"I had never seen this movie before, but couldn't beat the price! Lindsay Lohan is in it so you know what kind of acting to expect. However I was suprised that I actually enjoyed most of this movie. In order to save her job she pretends to be pregnant and does not know when to stop the lie."
3,An average flick,"This girl becomes obsessed with holding up the image of being pregnant that it's pathetic. I love movies and this was average and that's being generous. Lindsay Lohan is really struggling to take her career to higher levels, and though this is an older flick, I'm not sure it made an impact in her upward mobility. But it's not a bad movie to watch on a rainy day."
2,Eh...,I read reviews that really liked this movie and there are some of Lindsays that I really like so I decided to watch it. I would like that time back. Some aspects were interesting but overall not something I liked nor will I watch again. The main character was just unlikeable and unrelatable at all parts of the movie when it shouldn't have been that way.
3,3 1/2 stars,"I don't usually review movies but I wanted to pop in to offer some support for Lindsay Lohan. I just saw the movie last night and she was pretty good in it! I was really expecting to hate the movie and laugh at her for being such a failure but no, not only was her acting good, she looked good too! She does play a 25 year old and she looks the part, even though she's younger in real life but it's good to see that it really seems like she gave up on the drinking and partying when she was filming.Cheryl Hines was a blast too, I love her from Curb Your Enthusiasm. And the lady that plays Hilda from Ugly Betty has a part in the movie also! She was super funny and stole every scene she was in :DThis movie is a HUUUUGE improvement from the disaster called 'I know who killed me'.Keep it up Lindsay! 3 1/2 stars."
3,Kinda cheesy crap,"Eh.... I mean it was not gonna get an oscar, but I mean look who the star is. But if you like Lindsay, you may like this. But it is really corny."
4,watch it,"I liked the movie. It was good. Not that I love Lindsay Lohan, but she acted well good. The movie wasn't that funny for me, however it is worth watching. I can't give it 5 stars, cause I didn't laugh much or at all. But the story line is quiet original. I liked it."
3,funnier than you'd expect,"Shockingly, this film is a lot better than its premise would warrant. It's funny and silly and entertaining. Lindsey Lohan is back to top form in a role that is borne out of circumstance - Lohan plays a young woman forced to take care of her sister because their parents die in a car crash. As such, she is unable to finish college and becomes a secretary who is about to get fired. So she does the only thing she can - she pretends she is pregnant to avoid getting laidoff. When she pretends for too long, all hilarity ensues. Not as fun as ""Baby Mama,"" this film adds a variation to the romantic comedy genre."
4,fuel filter,purchase this with fuel pump. its doing its job and im happy my daughters car is running fine without the threat off cutting off while driving.
3,Gas saver no joke,I replaced my old gas filter with this new one my car gas mileage is very very good.my car even runs a litter smoother now. thank you look for more orders from me David.
2,Lasted 6 months then died.,"When I got this card working it did fine as a gigabit port but its operation was very inconsistent under Win 7 64 bit on a HP Pavilion. If the router restarted, its connection dropped off and forced me to restart the laptop, which was then followed by long minutes of fiddling with the card to get the PC to detect it.I got the SYBA card as a replacementSyba SD-EXP24010 ExpressCard 34mm Gigabit LAN Network Cardand even though it is not perfect it does the job better for a fraction of the price."
1,BELKIN SUPPORT DID NOT SUPPORT ME DO NOT BUY BELKIN PRODUCTS,"I bought this for use on one Laptop running Vista, to transfer the data to a desktop at high speed.It did not work with this laptop, I called Belkin Technical support the agent wanted to get rid of me once I got it working first time with another laptop that I did not want to use it with.I asked to spek to someone else, they said a agent would call back and they did not.Ok there is some sort of system conflict but they should help sort it out or whats the point of having support if it doesnt.I will never buy a Belkin product again due to the lack of support.It's too late as I have transfered all the data over wifi network sloooowly."
5,Belkin Gigabit Card,"My internal ethernet device failed in my laptop recently and I need a wired connection for downloading, wireless just doesn't cut it. I couldn't use my old PCMCIA ethernet card as my new laptop only has a slot for express cards. My network at home is 100MB and this card worked great. Fedora found it right when I plugged it in, and I've had 0 problems with it. My main concern when I bought it was if it was Linux compatable, and it is.Now I'm tempted to switch my network to Giga for the speeds."
3,to tight,This headbands are to tight on the head.. I purchase 4 of them for me and my friends.. and no one used them because they did not fit us
3,Do not use if you are trying to become a teacher,"Because you'd be wasting your time...This book is technical and complicated at first but then gets elementary. It was not what I was hoping for when thinking I'd learn some helpful teaching strategies. However, the book does do a great job with learning in general. I will keep this book to one day go back through it when I have kids but won't use it for teaching classes."
3,Good writing always works,"It always amazes me that as long as the author has talent and is a good storyteller, then he/she can make a seemingly uninteresting story line amazing enjoyable. The story, although not too uneventful, is not exactly action packed with masterfully gifted plot twists. And yet it's still enough to hold your attention and make you want more. What is so exceptional about this book is that it's good reading because it's so well written. Maugham's characters are so beautifully portrayed, and contain such interesting personality traits, that you simply want to read about them. His characters provide insight into different aspects of life, society, politics and everything that makes life interesting, from nature to love, money & sex. It always feels good to read a good book, and this is good."
4,Good for pre-k or beginner.,"This book only has 1 word per color page. It is good for helping children who are learning French identify the words with correct spelling and articles attached, but its best for a very early learner since the words are not advanced. My children (5 & 7) already knew all of the words in the book - but - it is being enjoyed for review and is helping to reinforce visual recognition of the word. A quality book - just best for beginners or review."
1,"so minimalistic, not worth the $5","This is an alphabet book with one word per page. 26 words are illustrated. One whole page is Q for Quebec, another is T for tarte, etc. I expected something entirely different."
2,Fun But Not Educational,This is purely an added bonus to any French lessons you are already conducting with your young children. Do not consider this a primary source for learning French.
4,did you know...,"Dan 'Goober' Miller played Johnny Cash' lead guitar player Luther Perkins in 'Walk the Line'?ANDThe drummer for their last album (not this one) was none other than Jack White of the White Stripes?Well, Now you do. Feel smarter?That said, these guys were great. I definitely recommend picking up either of their discs."
3,Not as heavy as I was hoping,"These would work ok if you need just a little weight, but even all 4 of them in the package together barely weigh anything. I originally bought them to weigh down my shower curtain to keep it from going outside the tub but they arent heavy enough. I am now going to try them on my tent as there is a free hanging room divider which blows around too much if the windows are down. I wouldnt buy these again and wouldnt recommend them unless you need something you can sew into fabric and cant find anything else"
2,Don't work for holding down quilt hanging,These did not work for me for the purpose for which I purchased them...and I used multiples trying to get them to work.
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL MUSIC LOVERS!!,"This is the best CD we have ever listened to. We bought two CD's, so that we didn't have to fight over the first one any more. Every single song is awesome, and yet very different from the next. This CD combines rock, jazz, blues, and folk music into meaningful ""Christian"" songs. The lyrics have great meaning, and the music is extremely well written and recorded. We have recommended this CD to all of our neighbors, friends, and family. A MUST HAVE CD!!!"
3,Great idea...valve leaks,"I fell in love with the product immediately, but after dealing with water on me from a leaky valve, I'm not so sure...I'd return it for an exchange, but I see from other reviewers that this might be a design flaw."
1,leaks,Mouth piece leaks a lot. Have only used it about ten times and it's gotten progressively worse so I need to try and replace it.
2,great until it leaks,This pack is great until the bite valve starts to leak. After a few months use it began to leak a little and then a lot! Is really annoying and a waste of water. No replacement valve available that I can find.
4,HIGH SIERRA - VERY GOOD HYDRATION PACK,H.S. WAVE 70 IS A VERY GOOD CHOICE FOR PERSONAL HYDRATION SYSTEMS; EXCELLENT SIZE AND CAPACITY. SOME DIFICULT TO CLEAN INSIDE THE RESERVOIR.EASY WATER FLOW.
1,LEAKS!!!!,"don't waste a penny on this one. leaks from the mouth spout, so you get wet on the front of yourself the whole hike."
5,Awesome Pack,I have had this for about 6 months and have not had any trouble with it. Cheap and very good quality.
3,Bought 2 - Returned 1,"Bought two of these hydration packs at the same time - 1 of them worked GREAT the other not so good. It started leaking out the bottom about halfway through our hiking trip. As soon as we got home I returned the one and started looking at different ones. We will keep the one that didn't leak, but will buy a different brand for our second hydration pack."
3,SOFT NOIR...,"Smooth/soft jazz renderings of classic noir film themes. Lacks the hard edge that defines noir. Acceptable for what it is, but may not be exactly what you're looking for...buy a drink and settle back in the cocktail lounge."
1,Film Noir Bar-Mitzvah Band Nightmare.....,"Perfect Music for the ""Casablanca Lounge"" at the Radisson, Minneapolis.Soul-less."
3,Bad video transfer on one dvd,All but steep and deep look good and have good audio. the transfer on Steep and Deep is so bad its not really watchable. audio is not tracked right and goes from low to loud with the music being too much. the video is alright but VHS quality. the others were fine
5,love,if i would have bought all 4 of these seperatly it would have been more expensive.glad it is a box set & it arrived on time!
4,"traditional Warren Miller, but no music!",What I was really looking for was the sound tracks so I could rip them and ski to Warren in my ears. No such luck.
4,Case Management Review,This was a required book for a case management class. It was an easy read. It is a good resource book for case managers and for people (like me) who had no prior knowledge of case management. The language and explanations were easy to understand.
5,Seymour and Co at their finest,"Taken from the last show on the Juggernaut tour of '98, this live CD goes very close to showing just how awesome the Hunna's are live. Virtually a greatest hits live, the disc bristles with energy from start to finish. Stand out tracks for me were The Slab, When The River Runs Dry, What's A Few Men, and Barry Palmer's guitar on True Tears Of Joy.Also rumoured to include a guest appearance by the Oil's axemen Jim Moginie and Martin Rotsey on a few tracks.This is Oz pub rock at its finest. Buy it, put it on, and turn it up. Loud ! To truly experience the live show, put on a couple of very heavy sweaters, drink beer, smoke a packet, and scream and sing along til you lose your voice. Then you'll be close to experiencing Hunters & Collectors live.Hey guys, what about farewell tour to the US ? And bring the Oil's as support if you like."
4,Haunting...,"This movie is a tale of a haunting story. A young man makes up a story that his father sent his mother, pregnant with him, on a flight with explosives. His motivation for telling this story, people's reactions to his story, and what he learns about his own history is the tale.The music, acting, and plot all meld together to make this an intriguing film. Throughout, you will just be wondering... ""How is it going to end"""
3,good,"Intending on pasting it up, comes with three back and front sheets which means most grammar and nouns are covered."
4,Grammar Quickstudy,"It is short, accurate and to the point, but the problem is Russian is so complicated that you can't expect to learn from this card. There just simply isn't enough room. So, if you're already proficient in Russian and want it to brush some dust off, this is an excellent choice."
2,The Zombie Apocolypse is Boring,"I am a huge fan of zombie movies. I realize you are sometimes going to get all special effects and no plot, bad acting or poor cinematography. The tiny bit of story this movie contained was poorly acted. The one thing this movie had going for it was the African backdrop. This is really just a quest movie with a contrived reason to get from point A to point B with poorly developed sub plots to attempt to make it interesting. I fast forwarded several times because I just couldn't take yet another scene of slowly driving through endless roads filled with slowly moving zombies. Honestly I think a grade schooler could have come up with this script. I don't understand the positive reviews."
3,not good,this movie was boring had no plot and no real ending. you knew about the movie in the first 5 min the zombie look so fake
3,Good movie,"I liked it, it wasn't great, but it was pretty good. I like more battles than this had, but still pretty good."
2,Terrible.,"The movie had a very basic storyline, and ended on a note that didn't make sense at all. Africa is huge, and the idea that every square inch of this country he is in is swarming with the undead is highly unlikely especially due to the fact that I can low crawl faster than these zombies walk. Parts of this movie are decent but the majority of it sucks. If you want to watch a good zombie flick, click next, try something else. 4/10"
3,Decent,"I enjoyed this movie. It definitely wasn't one of the best zombie movies I've seen. I felt that it was missing something, story-wise. It had lots of zombie killing, which is always good, but no matter how much guts and gore there is, the story is always most important. Good movie still though. Worth a watch!"
3,For Fans of Zombie Flicks,"If you are a fan of Zombie Horror movies, you'll appreciate this little gem. I liked it because it's a bit different from the others I've seen. It takes place in Africa (filmed on location in Ghana) as a ""white' American tries to evade the flesheaters. Not a big budget offering, but worth a look."
2,"This is the ""best zombie movie of the year""? Really?","Wow... talk about bad acting. I realize I'm reviewing a zombie movie, but would it kill the producers to find a mediocre actor at least? The guy who played Brian was awful. The guy who played Daniel was okay, but most of the movie centered on Brian. Honestly, at times, I was really hoping Brian would get killed off.On top of all this, the first 20 minutes or so had almost no dialogue. Again, I realize it's a zombie movie, but some dialogue is better than none, especially when the first 20 minutes are flat-out boring.The only reasons I gave this 2 stars and not one is because the setting was different and the special effects for a low-budget film were pretty good. Still, I can't recommend this. It was really bad."
2,Very let down...,"I was really looking forward to this based on the reviews it is getting on Amazon. For the first ten minutes, it lived up to the hype. But I slowly realized that I didn't care at all about the stock characters, and that, although there was some good old-school gore, the majority of the effects budget was spent on colored contact lenses. The movie gets very, very repetitive: guys drive through the desert, slow down for some reason, zombies wander in and are killed with boring shots to the head, guys drive away through the desert, repeat, repeat, repeat.This could have been a decent movie, but it is hamstrung by a low budget, phoned-in performances, and zombies which differ only in how much fake blood was applied by the person doing makeup."
4,Different & Better then most.,"I have seen this film and these Ford Brothers are real good movie makers, the zombies move as they should=slowly like they do in Georges 1st'night of the Living Dead""Night of the Living Dead. I did like the story line, and I as far as I know it has not been done like this before. The actors are good and even if it's not the best, it's better then most and deserves four stars."
4,Good zombie movie,"Pretty intense, not the worlds greatest acting or dialogue (actually very little of that), but it is still a good movie in the zombie apocalypse genre."
4,Zombies for grown-ups,"Really, it's the mood in this film that makes it something special. Far superior to most recent zombie movies, this has a relentless feeling to it. These zombies are slow moving and fairly easily good, but they multiply fast and through sheer numbers, overcome human adversaries.We aren't given any explanation as to the origin of these zombies, and don't need one. The fact that they're there is sufficient to cause the creeps in our spines.The ending can puzzle the viewer a bit...to explain would be to spoil the finale. But the mood and the intelligence of the film make this one terrific zombie film."
4,Very Enjoyable,"Very enjoyable movie. The plot may be simple, but the unique location makes this movie worthwhile. Hopefully, there will be a part 2. Not the typical gory horror movie."
4,Relentless,"While the dead in this film are oh so painfully slow, they are EVERYWHERE,and that is the problem for the living.There is nowhere to rest from the infected.They come from everywhere.No time for soul-searching, or trying to figure out the cause when you are on the menu!A worthy effort in the low budget realm of zombie films."
5,"amazing, the first film on par with Romero's classics","that creeping dread, the impending doom, hopelesness of the end, discovering there is no ""rescue station"" there's no supply drop coming, but still continuing on for some reason. This was the true survival horror feeling of the Romero classics and it's captured so well, and there is even some of the social commentary in ""the Dead"" that Romero always managed to sneak into his earlier films (perhaps subconsciously)this is so lacking in the recent efforts, including the Walking Dead (which is still great)The landscapes of Africa themselves beautiful and frightening, I found myself enjoying the unique countryside as much as the tale of survival and horror."
4,If you like zombie movies...,"If you like zombie movies, then THE DEAD is probably one of the best of the bunch.It was shot in Africa and stars Rob Freeman as an Air Force Officer, the sole survivor of a plane crash in an area of that continent where the dead seem to be coming back to life and attacking the living.After several close escapes from the zombies, Freeman meets up with an African Army sergeant, Prince David Osei, whose village has been overrun by the dead creatures, and the two join forces.Written and directed by Howard J. Ford and Jon Ford, The Dead has some very exciting, suspenseful action sequences and also features some nice scenery.As indicated in the opening paragraph, if you are an aficionado of zombie movies, this one should be your cup of tea.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary from thr Ford Brothers, deleted scenes and a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette.Michael B. Druxman"
1,Crap!,Horrible film. Not worthy of anybody Zombie collection. It was a blind purchase and I gave it away. Nuff said.
2,Didn't care for it,"I'm a zombie movie kind of guy, but this onejust didn't impress. Maybe a 3 star at best.Kind of borderline on this one, but didn't enjoyit a lot, so thumbs down."
2,Really???,"Really I know there are alot of Zombie Movies out there but really come on limited bullets so lets shot them Zombies in the belly, leg, arm everywhere but the HEAD the Head is what you need to shot this Movie is no Walking Dead lots of blood and eatting bodys but if you know a blow to the head is what kills them get it done...Big thumbs down"
1,This movie is TERRIBLE!,"There are only 2 directors that can pull out GREAT ZOMBIE FLICKS and that's George Romero and Zack Snyder. What a location....Africa was great.It was like a dash of resident evil 5 game, but then begins to collapse almost immediately, poor make up artist(Need Greg Nicotero or David LeRoy Anderson), bad acting, the plot was too simple, . I am a huge Zombie fan and got lots of Zombie flicks. This movie is thumbs way down like many others.New Zombie genre Directors need to be more creative, macabre and give the Zombie fans its gore. Like ""Dawn of the Dead"" Zack Snyder remake....implement more tension like Zombies RUNNING! 3 zombie stages, Great make up artist David LeRoy Anderson. Its a FACT...You Can not make a good zombie flick without a GOOD make up artist."
4,"Good, solid zombie survival movie",I was impressed with this movie. It was a solid zombie survival movie. The pace was the same throughout and the ending was solid. It was worth the rental price and something new to see.
5,DIFFERENT BUT NOT SO DIFFERENT ZOMBIE MOVIE,"Im a huge fan of the zombie genre,Romero,The Walking Dead etc so Ive been waiting for this release ever since I read about it in a two part article in Fangoria,it looked like a different kind of zombie movie in a very different location and I would have to say the film delivers.The article I mentioned chronicles the extreme hardships the filmmakers went through to film this on location,lead actor caught malaria and nearly died,the filmmakers themselves were sick a lot,one was robbed, and then they all were held by the local police,the severe heat,difficulties in getting their equipment into the country(everything had to be shipped in).They wanted to film this movie there because they thought it made a great location for a zombie movie....and it does."
4,The Dead,"This film was rather disturbing. I have had a growing love for zombie flicks over the past year and this one is one that has been the hardest to sit through so far. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, I just had a hard time watching all the films and getting through it. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who likes zombie movies, it is a break from the regular movies and it is the first where I've actually seen the zombies chew the flesh they bite off their victims."
1,THE DEAD HAS NO LIFE,"Not being a big zombie movie fan, I was reticent about viewing THE DEAD. The generally positive reviews and its claim for originality swayed me, hence I gave THE DEAD a chance.The west Africa setting is unique, strangely foreboding in its sunbaked beauty. The Ford Brothers use the zombie infestation almost as a disturbing backdrop, deciding to focus on the bonding of its two focal characters who break dialogue when another flurry of exploding heads is required to remind us it's a horror movie. The main problem with THE DEAD is it's just dull and boring. Of all the venerated horror genres, zombies are the most limited and tiresome. Only the zombie films that infuse self-deprecating humor like ZOMBIELAND and SHAUN OF THE DEAD have given new life to a tired subject.Ultimately, THE DEAD is mainly recommended for zombie die-hards."
1,so bad it really hurt my artistic sensabilities,"You are given money adn you give back dog poo, I never get how this si allowed to happen. Goons like this should be run out of the film biz!!"
2,Bummer Movie,I kept waiting for the movie to take on steam and create a life threatening conflict for the two main actors but it never came. What this movie turned out to be was for me to watch two guys taking a Sunday stroll through zombie park. Bummer. For a little more than 3 bucks I ended up seeing African landscape that I probably never be able to see in person. I should not have listen to the other reviews about how good the movie was supposed to be.
3,Zombie flick,"Movie itself was kind of lame. Cliche zombie flick. Kind of boring to me personally but to each his own. Not a very exciting story line, but for gore fans it has some intersting moments."
3,Last and Least,"I was disappointed in the author Coe's character development for the ""Eagle Sage"". Marar, rival leader to Melyor, is crafty and ingenious one moment, and then a complete idiot in the next scene. The free-mage Tammen and her bumbling cohorts seem way too venal, gullible, and downright dumb to have survived to become adult mages. Lastly, bringing Sartol back from the dead, more powerful than he ever was alive, seemed a bit hokey to me. Sartol's rise and fall from power in this book appeared to be made up as it went along.I think Coe should have developed a logic to his system of magic that the reader could grasp. Though the main protagonist Jaryd believes that magecraft is a gift from the gods, the overall stupidity of many of the mages leads the reader to think that the ability is a random genetic fluke of some sort.I gave this book 3 stars because it is 600+ pages, but keeps the reader enertained and turning the pages right to the end-- despite it's shortcomings."
1,Worst Ending ever,"This is by far one of the WORST endings I have ever read. The first book may have been good, but Coe failed to expand on any of the magic systems, characters, or subplots that had potential to make this book interesting. The magic system was vague (which is fine for a first novel, but by the conclusion I want some explanation) and unimaginative, as were many of the characters. The book's outcome was extaordinarily predictable. If you have liked this series so far, don't destroy your image with this book."
5,great book,"Coe wove a masterpiece, moving away from the boring nal to spend more time with Jaryd and other bird mages. He impressed me because it does not seem as long winded as his previous books."
5,Why do some people buy greatest hits colllections?,"The people who complain that this is a rip-off because they already own everything else are missing the pointBuy this so you have everything in one place, it's great!"
1,"""slip them into different sleeves!""","The Smiths said it best in their song about the corrupt greed of the music industry _Paint A Vulgar Picture_: ""Re-issue, re-package/re-evaluate the songs/double pack with a photograph/extra track (and a tacky badge)"". That's exactly what's happening here: they've taken songs you already know and love and slapped some new cover art onto them, regurgitated them in a sequence different than you are accustomed to hearing them, thrown in a couple of ""bonus tracks"" and some news articles. Big deal. If you're already a TMBG fan, chances are you already own 98% of the material that is presented here in the Dial a Song collection (and really, is ""Boss of Me"" really that great a song? It's one of the very few TMBG songs I find totally annoying). Why buy them all over again? ..."
4,Waking the Sleeping Goddess,"Alawashka is the voice of a beloved integral part of our being that we have not felt or heard for aeons. She is the voice/sound of a part of us so deeply ""home,"" so familiar to our bones that we feel her before our mind even registers the fact. Lumari brings the reality of Alawashka to our yearning hearts in a simply told explanation that leaves no doubt that the Goddess has awakened on Earth, and we have been brought back into the fold of the divine."
5,Not Just for 9-12 Year-Olds,"The author of previous HP clue books has chosen to be the editor of this new book of essays by HP fans of all ages and descriptions. The essays are as varied as their authors and will be an interesting read for adult HP fans as well as the 9-12 age group. It is a book to be read slowly and savoured. It is a fun and thought-provoking read. Sometimes you will say to yourself ""Hmmm, I never thought about that. He/She could be right."" You will enjoy having this book to read while waiting for HP Book 6. Thanks Wizarding World Press."
5,Magical,"I just got this book for Christmas, and I've fallen in love with it. The authors are members of the Mugglenet forums, who have used their wealth of HP knowledge to compose essays especially for this book. The essays run the gamut from ""Who is the Half-blood Prince?"" to ""Is Percy just a stupid git?"" and the writers range in age from 8 to 40+. Even the illustrations are done by fans, and beautifully.Someone not as obsessed as myself might be a little overwhelmed (some essays contain VERY detailed analysis) but you should still enjoy it. And if you're a part-time fan looking to go full-time, this is the book for you!"
4,Good for new Potter sleuths,"I think this book is excellent for Potter sleuths who are just starting out. It compiles articles from some readers who have spent a lot of researching, and they have come up with some interesting theories. It also gives varied guesses about the identity of the Half Blood Prince, but comes to no conclusion. For those of us who spend a lot of time on Potter related web sites, we may find we have already encountered most of these theories, but it was a good book overall."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This promises to be a great performance considering the stellar cast. The problem here is not the cast or the performance, but the shoddy job of transcribing done for this recording. Besides being poorly remastered, it is running fast, a whole half-step high in pitch which distorts the voices of the principals, making them sound pinched and nasal which they were not. Shame on Gebhardt, which is usually very consistent in their reissues, for miserably botching this recording. Unless you have a variable speed cd player I would suggest you stay away from this one!"
1,Time is short. Don't waste your time on this book.,"I don't usually read a book and feel ripped off (from my time and money). Since I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, I promptly threw it away when I was finished. Helen Bonner seemed to simply wander through her life with no particular direction. I was frustrated with her inability to stay the course on any one subject. I bought the book because it was marketed as a book about incest. Her sexual abuse comprised about 2% of the content. It was not a book about incest. It was a book about the craziness of the 60s and 70s with free sex, drugs, and self-absorption. If you are looking for a book on incest, you will be very disappointed."
2,"The bottom line on this book, imho:","If you're an incest survivor, you might find it worthwhile, because you'll relate to a lot of what's there.If you're just looking for a satisfying read, skip this book - it's poorly crafted."
2,"""The Laid Daughter"" - Don't bother with this book.",I love reading. I love books. This book is awful. I could not even bring myself to finish it. It's so nerve wrecking tring to hold on through the author's many descriptions of everything but the real point of this story. Which is told through ENDLESS mini- side stories. Constant flash backs to her hippy days etc. -N. Hope
2,Spectrum too sweet,"This recording has a lot to answer for, having spawned literally a thousand similar relaxation records. I bought it enthusiastically in the mid-seventies. How has it aged? Not very well, I`m afraid, the passing years revealing all too well its lack of musical substance. I will not deny that it may relax children and musically uneducated adults. But I cannot stomach his pretense that this Western diatonic scale rambling is being linked to the actual activity of the chakra system. This is the stuff confusion is made of, and Halpern would deserve more than two stars if he simply stuck with his ability to compose harmless relaxation pieces, not calling it music with actual ability to heal."
5,Truth In A Clear Form,"Although it this a small book, it is not lacking.There are no unnecessary stories or a lot of examples to get through, just simple and straight writing on the subject.If you're new to non-duality/Advaita, this is THE place to start. If you've been around it awhile, this is still an enjoyable, easy to understand book.A book of this type doesn't have to be long to answer the quesitons that arise, the heart just needs to be open, and if you're ripe as they say, the understanding can take place in an instant."
2,REBORN,"I DID NOT THINK THIS MOVIE WAS BAD. IT HAD IT'S MOMENTS AND LUCY LU DID A GOOD JOB. I WOULD HAVE THIS IN MY COLLECTION. LOVE VAMPIRE MOVIES. EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SUGGEST IT WAS A VAMPIRE MOVIE, IT WAS EASY TO FIGURE IT OUT. BUT IT IS ENJOYABLE TO WATCH. I HAD TO WATCH IT TWICE. FEW DAYS IN BETWEEN OF COURSE.I WAS JUST WONDERING... IS THERE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS MOVIE? ONE WAS DONE OCTOBER 9, 2006 UNRATED AND THE ONE WITH LUCY LU WAS DONE 2007. DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THIS IS THE SAME CHARATERS IN THIS MOVIE OR IS IT COMPLETLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S UNRATED?"
2,hmm...it was okay...,"I haven't read all the reviews posted here but i saw no mention of the movie The Hunger, with david bowie and susan surandon and even a guest shot appearance of Bauhaus. that movie is also okay and more of a cult film. the only reason i'm mentioning that film is because although Rise has a sort of Blade meets whatever revenge movie you may want to think of, including being trained for combat before the fight, it also copies from The Hunger the fact that these day-walking vamps have no fangs and instead use small liitle blades just like the ones used in The Hunger to cut whatever arteries to fulfill their cravings...anyway, as far as the movie Rise i thought it was okay, defintely not great. would get into more details but for that you can read other reviews. time for me to move on"
2,OH MY TALK ABOUT A BAD MOVIE,Ok I have been waiting for a while to see this movie. I was watching the trailer on Apple's site and it looked pretty good. But I never saw it show as being in the movies (first bad sign). Then I saw it hit Unbox and thought great. I looked at the review and it was very positive (second bad sign) So instead of renting it I brought is out right(third bad sign) This movie was DOA if not for the hot chicks in it (2 of them) it would have gotten 1 star. To say this is better then any of the blade flims you did not watch the same movie I did. Please re-watch it with your glasses on this time. I feel like sending Lucy Lu a bill for my time I lost watching this thing. How did her and the guy from the shield get attached to this project did they loose a bet and paid up by being in this flim? Watching paint dry while listening for the grass to grow in winter would have been more fun. AVOID this at least until the price drops to $1.99 it should hit that price by 1/1/2008
3,Rise: Blood Hunter (Unrated/Undead Edition),"Rise: Blood Hunter (Unrated Undead Edition)I first caught a glimpse of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel and I was intrigued. I purchased it from Amazon and for the most part enjoyed it. Lucy Liu was awesome as a modern day reporter that is turned into a Sexy Vampire out for revenge against the Vampires that turned her. Michael Chiklis (Fantastic 4, The Shield, & The Commish) was great as an alcholic, revenge seeking detective who's daughter get's turned by the same group.The only problem I had was the filming jumped all over the place without any segue (Example: one minute Lucy is in the trunk of a car and without any rhyme or reason she is back in a bar. Then later on she is breaking oyt of the trunk).It was still enjoyable as a Vampire Film."
2,D.O.A.,The acting lacked a lot in this movie and the plot lacked direction. This is one of those films that could have at one point had potential but fell way short when actually done. I normally enjoy Lucy Liu in films but not this time. It just didn't make the grade and fell way short of my expectations.
5,awesome vampire movie,Just ordered this in Blue Ray.Love this movie and think its one of the top 3 vampire movies out there !!I have seen it on TV and there are a few different versions of this movie.The blond woman in the start of the movie (Franny) is absolutely spectacular !!!!
2,unintentionally funny horror film,"After she's murdered and partially devoured by members of a cannibalistic death cult, investigative reporter Sadie Blake (Lucy Liu) returns to earth as a flesh-consuming, bow-and-arrow-wielding member of the undead bent on exacting revenge on those who killed her.If you can swallow this premise, you might just possibly enjoy this ludicrous, frequently laughable, two-hour-long foray into sadism, cannibalism, vampirism, necrophilia and supremely bad acting. Sadie is at least a ghoul with a bit of a conscience - she feels really really bad when she has to eat someone - so we'll give her points for that, but the movie dedicated to telling her story rates a big fat zero on every other conceivable count."
1,RISE LUCY LUI RISE!,"Rise Lucy Liu rise...and resurrect your abysmal film career!I mean, what were you thinking? What was it about playing a bulimic, pill-popping, time-traveling, unconscious, body-bag-wearing, flesh-eating, angry, powerless vampire that attracted you to this role?Seriously, I was expecting a cross between Charlie's Angels and Blade, or at least Buffy. There was no super-natural power scene, not even hand-to-hand combat. This movie delivered nothing but urge to fast forward. The only rise I got was out of my chair and into the next room to choose another movie. I will never get back those two hours, but I will always have those five bad sub-plots to continue to haunt me for the rest of my movie going days.In short, I expected more from such a fine and accomplished actress as Lucy Lui. Girl, make better choices; think Angelina, Jody, Hilliary, and avoid the Lewis, Hilton, and Madonna side of the scene."
1,Rise,"One of the worst Vampire movies I have ever seen, plot holes and extremeley slow paced and boring. Not worth watching."
4,Sex and murder,"I thought this was actually a good movie. Lucy Liu does a good job of carrying the story, and Carla Gugino (smoking hot), as the vampire who sires her, and James D'Arcy as the lead villain are quite good. The title of the review is their opinion of the important things in their world. Michael Chiklis has kind of a thankless role, but his scenes with Lucy are good. The story jumps back and forth, unnecessarily, but as several other reviews have mentioned, the scenes where Lucy's character comes back to life and her feedings are well done. The photography was striking, especially the scene where she is hanging upside down with the other bodies. Oh, and viewers will learn that Marilyn Manson looks better with his makeup!"
4,Rise: Blood Hunter,"Good vampire flick. I loved Lucy Lui's tormented, reluctant vampire persona. It was definitely a new twist on the classic vampire genre."
2,so boring it is deadly,"Wasted money for those who bought it. Wasted time for Lucy Liu. Slow, extremely cliched, very boring. Probably the most boring vampire movie I have ever seen (seen lots of them). A pity that an interesting idea and difficult to spoil theme was misused in such a way."
2,A bloody mess.,"Despite my low expectations, RISE: BLOOD HUNTER was an utter disappointment. I'm a huge fan of Lucy Liu - O-Ren's extended backstory is the main reason why I prefer Vol. 1 of KILL BILL to Vol. 2 - not to mention, vampire flicks, which is why I just had to rent a copy of RISE, negative reviews be damned. All I can say is, that's two hours of my life that I'll never get back. (Or maybe it just felt like two hours; Amazon's listing puts the run time at 94 minutes, oy.) The plot is predictable, the dialogue, cringe-worthy. RISE is just bad enough to be an exercise in banality; but not awful enough to elicit (unintentional) laughs. RISE is painful to watch, even (especially) for die-hard Lucy Liu fans.Do yourself a favor - check out UNDERWORLD or 30 DAYS OF NIGHT instead."
1,Rise:BLOOD HUNTER (UNRATED),"ONE OF THE WORST VAMPIRE (?) MOVIES EVER!!I GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE I LIKE LUCY LIU BUT,THIS FLICK HAS NO BITE (REALLY) AND STILL SUCKS!!!!.BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK."
4,new version of the vampire,This movie gives a whole new twist to the vampire genre. It may have it's plot holes but it still has some pretty parts of the movie. It has it slow parts but that's all they are there parts.
3,really peels potatoes!,"Just make sure this fits your model. I purchased it for a slightly larger Kenwood mixer and have to hold it down to get it to work, but it does work!"
2,Whistling Tea Kettle,"This tea kettle would be and outstanding buy if the handle didn't swivel, the whistle wasn't so loud.(the sound could wake the dead), it sounds almost like a ship's whistle. Lastly the internal finish was not up to industry standards. It was a little on the rough side, I nix my finger on the inside cover when I was hand washing it."
1,Copy Protected - Do Not Buy If You Have An i-Pod,"Once again, EMI has created a copy protected CD which can be imported as WMA or AAC but not MP3. Once again, Amazon provides minimal warning about this (see guidance under ""Format""), instead of putting advice in our faces - which it does excellently to sell product.I'll be returning this CD as not fit for purpose. If you can afford to, I suggest that you also buy and then return it, to maximise cost and inconvenience to the label and Amazon. If not, just don't buy it, regardless of the quality of the music.This crap has to stop. 1 star review because Amazon prevents a zero star choice."
2,Whatever happed to Merle?,"Believe me this Cd has the most uninspiring songs I have ever heard come out of the mouth of Merle Haggard! Where were the Strangers (His Band?)The background music was unbelievably bad. I think merle has taken leave of his senses recording these songs They do not suit his voice at all. I Can't stop loving your music Merle, but with this batch of songs i came pretty darn close. I think a Country singer's band makes his music unique and compliments his voice. Can you imagine Waylon without his band picking behind him? or Johnny Cash, or Hank Williams? If you are a true Merle Fan you won't like this CD."
1,Not A Very Good Performance,"Word of caution here, this video was not sanctioned for release by Chaka Khan and her management, and with good reason. This particular DVD performance finds the legedary singer's voice in tatters. Khan was very hoarse and off-key during most of these songs. She looked great but she was obviously having a very difficult time with her voice. So if you are looking to add a live Chaka Khan DVD to your collection, SKIP THIS ONE! You will be very disappointed. Chaka does not normally sound this bad. I highly recommend that you instead start with ""The Signature Diva"" DVD, a concert that was originally filmed in 1981 with Khan in a very high energy performance where her voice is flawless. Also, ""Great Women Singers of The 20th Century"" DVD, which was originally filmed in 1993 and showcases Chaka looking smashingly beautiful while easing her way through some great jazz tunes."
3,Chaka fan.......,Pretty good sounds......they seem to start the song previous to Chaka chiming in and taking over the song........man she can still reach those high notes.....though....will be looking at other Chaka dvd's.....to see if there can be improvement......on sound....Chaka.....rocks...still...Eps.........
4,Pierre Boulez Dirige 1963 and 1966 Concerts,"This French-made, two-CD set was released in 1987 by the Disques Montaigne label as part of its Les Grands Concerts Inedits Du Theatre Des Champs-Elysees series. The first CD features Pierre Boulez conducting Orchestre National and Choeur de la Radio-Television Francaise on 06/18/1963 in the following works by Stravinsky: Quatre Etudes pour Orchestre (1929); Le Roi des Etoiles - cantate pour Choeur d/hommes et orchestre, poeme de K. Balmont (1911-2); Symphonies pour Instruments a vent (1920); Sermon, Narration et Priere - cantate pour soli, choeurs et orchestre (1961) w/ Joanna Peters, contralto, Herbert Handt, tenor & Sebastian Shaw, narrator; Le Sacre du Printemmps, ballet (1913). The second CD also features Pierre Boulez but on 01/30/1966 and conducting Orchestre de la Societe des Concerts du Conservatoire in Debussy's Jeux; Bartok's Concerto No 2 pour Piano et Orchestre w/ Jean-Bernard Pommier, piano; Berg's Trois (3) Pieces Op.6."
2,Veneance is mine,"Unnecessay foul language. I can take some bad language, but this one is overboard.It completely ruined what could have been a good video."
1,Ordered over a month ago and still have not received it !!!,"I placed this order on 4-27-09 and still have not received it yet. I sent an email request yesterday inquiring about it and still have not received a reply... If I ever get the products I ordered, I will let you know if I liked them."
3,Best of album,This is a best of CD with subliminal messages added. I was disappointed when I heard songs that I've already heard. The albumn is pretty good. I do find it relaxing. I just would have liked to known that the songs are not original before purchasing it.
2,Not what I was thinking it would be,"I was thinking that it would have some kind of melody to the music, it was just different sounds. Didn't really enjoy listening to it."
3,Easy to listen to,Easy to listen to but a little repetitive. I guess the word for this would be you have to be in the right mood
3,Effortless Relaxation,This CD was not as relaxing as I had hoped. The melody and rhythm were a little disjointed or strident at times.
2,What Relaxation?,Didn't offer any relaxation.Waste of money. Boring out of one's mind would be a better title. Subliminal suggestions- I doubt it.
2,Not very impressed,I got this CD with the hope it would help me relax while I meditate. I didn't care for it. Not my kind of music.
4,Sleep CD,This is a good CD if you can get past all the talking (advertising)at the beginning of the CD. The music that follows is very good getting to sleep music.
3,not sleepy enough,"Too repetative, made me want to speed up the Brahams lullaby. Just made me agitated. However my 8 yr. old daught listens to it many nights a bedtime and loves it. I like his Chakra CD much better and find it more relaxing."
1,Unhappy,This CD was advertised with two others purporting to be of ocean sounds. Ocean Suite and Healing Sounds do not have ocean sounds; neither does Sleep Soundly. I am dissatisfied with this CD and it is on its way back to Amazon.com for a refund.
4,Learn to fall asleep better,Love this CD. It brings my crazy day to a calm end and has helped my inability to fall asleep. I've never heard the end of the CD because I'm sound asleep!
5,This is good to help you sleep and....,"I have so many Halpern CDs, its unbelievable. I recommend this one and several by Jeffrey Thompson, Delta Sleep System and the two CDs sets Music for Sleep Collections 1 and 2. Great!! I have no problems sleeping now that all of these are available for me to use. Never get bored with one, because there are now so many good selections to choose from. GO GET 'EM!!"
3,OK maybe it's just me,"There were a few cuts on this CD that I liked well enough. But for me, most of the music was a little like being trapped in a slow-moving elevator, and I couldn't wait to get off. I guess I found the music rather shallow. It just didn't touch me or reach me at a level deep enough to relax me or put me to sleep."
2,Not The Greatest CD for Falling Asleep To,"The piano tracks on this CD are a little ""syrupy,"" such as the lullaby melodies at various intervals ... I was looking for music that I could read to and fall asleep to that allows you to relax in a semi-meditative state and I find that this CD is too contrived in it's choice of melodies and tone varieties. If you are looking for light piano music this CD is fine, but if you are looking for soothing meditation sounds, this is not the CD for you."
1,Not relaxing at all!,"As others have noted, this CD is a disjointed collection of music that doesnt flow like some of his other music. It actually wakes me up when the song stops and then another one starts, sometimes at a different volume. The Lullaby by Brahms is annoyingly plodding. If you want relaxing peaceful Halpern music try Prosperity or Angels, but NOT this one!"
4,sleep,"This has worked on most of the times I used it. Only once did it not put me to sleep.There was a problem in shipping. Each of the cd's had cracked cases. Although I haven't listened to them all yet, the cd's themselves seem to be ok."
3,OK,"Was very hopeful that this would help me sleep, and it is soothing...but can't say it helps me sleep any better than other soothing music would."
2,Not impressed,"This tape was disappointing. It was Very repetitive musically, boring and not relaxing to listen to. One of Halpern's worst."
3,Meh,"Warning: I do not fit in with the ""new age"" hippie folk who bought and reviewed this album.I got this album because I wanted something soothing to fall asleep to - this mission was accomplished, as the music is quite soothing. But, I have listened to several Halpern records and I must say, for how many albums this guy puts out, a lot of them sound the same. Yes, the genre lends itself to repetition, which is part of the soothing aspect he is going for, but cmon. I also don't subscribe to the ""energy"" bs that a lot of the reviewers claim to feel when listening to it. Feeling ""energy"" from the music is just a snobby way of saying they liked it. It did not heal you, it did not purify your soul. It sounded good and made you feel better. ok."
4,great for people who have problems going sleeping.,This CD is recommended for people who have problems getting to sleep. Now you can go to sleep freely without the use of drugs or cigarettes! The track listings on the sampler is the old one. here is the new one.1. Brahm's lullaby (Trio)- 3:402. Sleep soundly - 7:453. Brahm's lullaby (Duet) - 2:154. Brahm's lullaby (solo) - 6:385. Sweet dreams - 10:076. Deep sleep - 5:317. Brahm's lullaby (Reprise) - 3:458. Sleep soundly II - 8:179. Eventide - 4:0410. Sweet dreams II - 5:10This CD will help you fall asleep faster & easily and wake up more refreshed in the morning!- Joel Marshall a fan of steven halpern
5,Excellent CD for a peaceful nights sleep,If you find yourself unable to sleep (insomnia) you will find this CD very helpful. The subliminal relaxation messages will have you asleep before the end of the CD. Small headphones and a CD player by your bed are recommended.
3,Relaxing but in wrong order,"Most of these tunes are indeed relaxing. However, they are in the wrong order. I have been awakened a few times at night by track 7. As track 6 finishes, the volume starts to fade. Track 7 starts louder than the rest of the tracks. Moreover, I find the piano tracks (3,5,9) too melodically active and thus not relaxing. I decided to create my own mix of these tunes leaving out the piano tracks but starting with track 7."
2,Poor Quality,"Printing quality so poor that some words are barely legible. Also, one page has only a series of grouped dashes on it. Page numbering was off in a spot as well."
4,Interesting Characters,"A friend of mine loaned me this book. I enjoy reading Ed McBain's mysteries. They are all mystery with a little fluff thrown in, just the way I like it. The characters in this book were unique. The author didn't have to tell you who said what. It was obvious. Murder at a wedding. Interesting. Good to meet the detective's parents and his wife is always a breath of fresh air."
2,no bueno,"this stockpot has the look of a high-quality product but all it took was a few boiling cans of condensed milk (for toffee pie) to permanently ruin the finish. there are now tarnished circles on the bottom where the cans used to be, and this has never been a problem with other stockpots. for a Calphalon item i expected better."
4,they mean it when they say don't use metal utensils!,"Huge scratches somehow appeared inside our stockpot one day, so now it's non-stick capabilities are non-existent. I don't know how it happened, but it did. We've had the stockpot for less than a year, so it's pretty disappointing, especially since we haven't had any problems with our other Calphalon things, (all our pots and pans are Calphalon One, just like this one). My assumption is that someone used metals utensils without realizing it -- so I would say in general, with Calphalon One, be sure to use the correct cooking implements.However, with all that said, I have to say too that until our stockpot met its untimely demise, it really was a great piece to have in the kitchen. I makes for really fast clean up, which is really great when you are dealing with such a humongous pot."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"The futon loos so much better online. When I unwrapped it and set it up, I was disappointed. It's not what I had hoped. It look plush online but its not :-("
3,Good teaching tool,"The children to whom I am teaching French are 6 years old. They are just beginning to read English. The French and English languages use the same alphabet - but very different phonetics. To put this book in their hands would interfere with their learning to read English. However, it is a good teaching tool for the teacher."
1,Is this French or German?,"I seem to have a newer version than most of the reviewers. I have an activity book and three CDs. However, when I opened the book, the title page says ""German for Children"". There are German pages interspersed with the French. This was very disappointing because I intended to immediately begin the lessons with my children but have to send it back. I am concerned that all of the guides were printed the same way. Has anyone else experienced this?"
4,Fun songs and children's voices,"The songs have catchy melodies so it's easy to learn them and join in. I like the fact that the delivery is fast, imitating native French speakers. Also a plus is that children's voices are used in the conversations which is more fun. Drawbacks are that the songs are imbedded in the middle of the instructional tracks on the CD. It would be better if they had their own designated tracks - because already my kids want to hear the songs but don't want to hear the narrator's explanation and translation."
5,Loved it,I have been looking for something like this for a long time and tried different product. This is by far the best so far. I'm also learning it with the children. Loved the parent's guide - gave me idea for teaching children in other learning process. Very good and highly recommend to others
4,ancient echoes,I used the CD in conjunction with relaxation techniques immediately prior to major surgery. I can recommend the CD in conjunction with relaxation/meditation. I have a couple of other CD's by Geogia kelly which I use too with a personal CD player.
4,Final Cut Live Rocks,"This Cd is worth buying for the Final Cut live,the live version of the song FInal Cut is an expirence not given in many of coheed's other songs, the live version gives you an extened song with more and better solos."
3,An actual Review,OK for the record people who are indending to review CDs Make shure you listened to the CD and make shure you're not talking about something totally unrelated....Really I'd give this Two and A HalfNow as for the COCA Single... I don't think this nessicary. It does have one of the radio tracks of their new album and a live track (which is recorded very well...)and a video (which you can get on the re release of Good apollo.) If you are a huge COCA fan and are looking for completeness to your collection then buy this but otherwise these are songs you can get somewhere else and for much cheaper...
1,Don't be fooled!,"Don't be fooled by the well known actors and the Academy Award Nomination. This one is really, really bad. The camera, music and story just float all over the place. Unless you like these surreal type of movies you will be fast asleep within 15-20 minutes.In all fairness I think this is another movie that some will get and others will not get. Seven Psychopaths is a similar type of movie.Maybe this type of movie is for you, but I have no patience for this slow moving type of story."
5,Another masterpiece from P.T. Anderson? I'm not surprised ;),"The Master is by far the best film of 2012...no words to describe the brilliance of this art. The acting is just MIND-BLOWING, anyone who LOVES Anderson's work (like me) will enjoy the hell out of this. Yes, it is not a film for everybody, but you cannot deny that this is cinema art."
1,POS,"This movie inspires nothing, does nothing, and was a complete waste of film and time.I want to rip my eyes out and then eat them and mail the s*** to the director.This movie should have all copies collected and burned.regretfullysomeone who has seen it"
1,waste of time,Do you have absolutely nothing else to do? or do you enjoy stories that go nowhere and take forever to get there? Then this one is for you.
1,I Hated this Movie,"It's rare for me, having paid for a streaming film, to turn it off halfway through. But halfway was already too far.I now understand why most of the audience at the film's premier in Cannes walked out. The screenplay is awful, the cinematography is cramped and nauseating and the acting is terrible. I am a huge Phillip Seymour Hoffman fan, but he just seemed constipated. And Joaquin Phoenix' performance was nothing but petty anger and distorted grimaces.I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this mess."
2,Lukewarm,The performances were good but the plot of the movie seemed to be bogged down. I am not sure I see this as worthy of Oscar nominations except for the performances.
3,The Master -- short review,"Really not a great movie at all. The dialogue was difficult, the story did not segue from point to point well, and many scenes were just not pertinent to the movie. The acting was tremendous, though: Amy Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman did an outstanding job."
2,You may want to drink some paint thinner.,"I really see no reason for a long drawn out review. Do people read four page reviews? Great acting (lipstick on a pig) in a horrible, boring and silly movie. I read a review in the New York Times that stated this was an ""actor's film"". I laughed my ass off. It is an actor's film because the only people that gave a poo about it were the actors in it. Save yourself some time and take a trip on mushrooms or something."
2,"Beautifully Shot and Acted, but Hollow","Maybe I just didn't get the point, but I sat through this entire film and not once did I ever get an inkling as to what exactly it was about. Perhaps that IS the point, but it didn't make it any more enjoyable. The leads are flawless as is the cinematography, but this appears to be little more than an oddball character study. I like most of Anderson's work, so I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I didn't enjoy this one."
3,"OK movie, but could have been great.",The story just didn't flow well. I live near St.Petersbugh Fl and the paper does stories about Scientology. The nude scene was overdone and I am not sure it added anything except shock to the movie plot. PSH acting was geat.
4,Open Your Mind,"Joaquin Phoenix is the main reason I watched this movie. It's his first serious acting role since his whole rap documentary hoax I'm Still Here. (I thought I'm Still Here was pretty ballsy.) And no regrets because Joaquin blew me away. People don't realize his acting depth. Honestly you have to go into this movie with an open mind and free time because it's slower paced. Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting was really phenomenal and passionate as well. This movie is definitely an acquired taste.Go into this movie with the acting in mind, not so much the plot or the cinematography or visuals."
2,I tried to like it,"The actors were great but the material was not. I kept with it but it was like nails on a chalk board. I read the reviews and thought there must be something in it that was worth something due to the Oscar nominations but I can honestly say that I wish I could get the hours back that I spent on this film. You've been warned but sadly so was I and I didn't take the advice, wish I had."
1,HORRIBLY GOOORING AND LENGTHY MOVIE !!,"NO wonder this did not win more at the Oscars, it was pretty bad indeed, the acting by Phillip Seymoor Hoffman was of course Outstanding as always, with what he was given, but overall a DOG !!"
2,What?!,Genuiine inability to develop plot or subplots despite- AMAZING performance turned-in by Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Pointless movie!
2,Prepare to be bored out of your mind.,We rented this movie because of the Academy Award nominations for Joaquin. He did do great job in that aspect but otherwise the movie is very boring.
1,Stinko,Lousy. Extremely distasteful movie. Made little sense and used nudity excessively and unnecessarily for what end? Acting by Hoffman good. Didn't like other characters much.
5,Beautiful,"The movie was absolutely beautiful! I saw it two times in the theaters. This movie captivated my mind. I'm at a loss for description...go see this move. This was Joaquin's best performance. The way he changed his face and body postures, amazing. Deep, deep, deep was this movie."
1,No,One of the most phenomenally bad movies I've seen in some time (and that includes the abysmal A Good Day to Die Hard). At least the Die Hard flick featured Bruce Willis flipping off a helicopter.
1,Couldn't stay with it,"A movie of focoused dissipation that was both enigmatic and boring. Stay with the movie was a chore, despite a good performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman."
2,Over the top...,"The acting is (too) great and highly believable but the story appears muddled and disjointed. I regret spending two hours watching Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman try to one-up each other's performance. Joaquin is on the comeback trail after spitting in the face of Hollywood but this performance is too excessive for the role. We know he can act but it is apparent that he is trying too hard to prove that he is the ""best"" actor in Hollywood. That chip on his shoulder is clearly getting in the way of his acting. Hoffman does quite well as ""Master"" but, again, his attempt is more than what the role calls for. Amy Adams is amazing and it is apparent that she has checked her ego at the door, unlike Phoenix and Hoffman. I recommend The Master for those who are fans of period pieces, notably 1945-1950, and over-acting; otherwise, skip it and watch one of the other movies that came out this year for a more enjoyable evening (Argo, The Avengers, Pitch Perfect, etc.)."
1,Master = not masterful,"really a very weird and boring film-- confused, oddly disquieting, acting is good I suppose ,but script and intent border on the incomprehensible"
1,Strange movie,Not sure I ever figured out what was going on. Slow moving and bizarre turns. Don't recommend it. 2 more words.
1,boring and slow,boring and slow. I had no interest in it. Had to watch it twice since I fell asleep the first time.
4,THE MASTER Odd But Entertaining,This movie centers around Freddie Quell a man worn down and a little crazy returning from WWII. Joaquin Phoenix plays the character very well even contorting his body all hunched over to a very sad and intriguing man. He finds Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) a man who is trying to start a cult and doing quite well at it. The scenes between the two are riveting and odd too. Some parts of the movie seemed slow but it is still an interesting drama.
1,Unmasterful Master,"Boring, listless movie. Could not even finish it. Very slow moving - like watching a car crash in slow motion. Who comes up with this crap?"
2,Boring downer,Didn't really get it. First half better than second. Kind of appears to portray Scientology/LRH. Parts didn't make sense. Mixed drinks were funny.
1,Depressingly vulgar,"What a vulgar excuse for a movie. I'm not offended. It would take more than the so called artists of the film industry to pull that off. I'm insulted. I think that I'm in a growing majority of film goers who are really getting fed up with unnecessary scenes of stupid sex and violence.The way the film ended was unsatisfying . Unresolved endings and films that just seem to stop are all too common nowadays. This lack of imagination abounds in the writing of this movie. There are plenty of smart films out there. This is not one of them. Don't waste your money. I tossed this one where it belonged, in the trash."
3,"Absorbing story, unevenly told.","It's always difficult to determine how much analysis movies like this deserve. The question that arises toward the end of the second hour is ""do I really care about Freddie Quell, and, if so, why?"" Phillip Seymour Hoffman is compelling and carries the movie - Phoenix is a net drag on it. Amy Adams is also very good, as is Laura Dern. Phoenix's name on a film has become, for me, a warning label."
1,"Very dark, borring","Only could make it thru 1/2 hour, and then stopped. Move is more about alcoholic military men. Dont waste you money on this movie."
1,Even L. Ron didn't like this film.,"This was simply the strangest and consequently worst film I've seen in a long time. It appears that the people who have effusively praised this film are the so-called professional film critics for various media outlets. We who attend a film to be entertained didn't get it, didn't like it, and don't recommend it to others. Unless of course you really, really want to see Philip Seymour singing ""I Want to Get you On a Slow Boat to China, a cappella, to Joaquin Phoenix for no apparent reason other than he could. I have it on good authority that L.Ron Hubbard who will live for another 75 million years even though he's really dead didn't like it either. Paul Thomas Anderson suckered a lot of people. Don't you be suckered too."
2,Joaquin Phoenix is great. The film is terrible.,Director Paul Thomas Anderson once again proves that he is incapable of telling a compelling story.Anderson is great with a camera and Phoenix is seething in his portrayal of an alcoholic wanderer...But there is no story here. The second half of the film is just a boring wasteland of wandering.Awful film.
1,Interestingly unsatisfying,"Hype and casting got us into the theater; film qualities, music, intensity of main characters kept us hoping for some sense to be made. When the credits rolled, I commented, ""well, what was all that about?"" My husband laughed with relief. He was afraid he had missed some compelling point and I was going to help him ""see the light"". While I found bits and pieces that tied some of my own history together, it was not satisfying. We paid, we sat, we do not recommend."
1,started checking my watch half way through,"Sitting through this film was painful. Other reviewers seem to want to decipher the film, psychoanalyze it. If I wanted to do that I'd say the characters in the film are all manifestations of The Master. Or that it was a dream, a nightmare. But really, besides Joaquin Phoenix's performance, it was the most boring, painful film ever. The sound track made me uneasy throughout the film. I was thrilled to finally, after an overlong film, be allowed to leave the theater. I checked my watch after the first half, thinking maybe I'd just leave, but stayed thinking that it must be almost over. Sadly, it wasn't. The hyped ""thinly veiled take on Scientology"" was a no-show. The movie was so incoherent, it was hard to tell what it was about."
1,Horrible.,"This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. Boring, boring, boring, boring, with brief breaks to be disgusting before it returned to being boring. After reading all the rave reviews, and having spent time in a somewhat cult-like religious atmosphere myself, I expected to be entertained and enlightened. I so much wish I could get that 2 1/2 hours and $7.50 back. Horrible, disjointed, ridiculous movie. The only good thing is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who never disappoints with a performance."
1,Self-Indulgence Personified,"I have seen all of Anderson's films and loved every one, but this one is a navel-gazing, self-important hot mess. Terrible, meandering pointless script, every scene dragged out until you want to scream; this is Razzie Award winning self-indulgence. This is someone who is convinced he is god's gift to film. Awful."
1,Like Walking In The Dark lost For 2 Hrs,"this was the most boring movie,please dont tell me i just dont get it,theirs nothing to get,just plain stupid,no real plot or point to get,the movie was like it wasnt even edited just shoot then print.."
1,"awful, awful","I didn't like the movie at all. I felt that I needed a shower. It was unrealistic. I prefer one that is more credible when dealing w/ cults. Waste of time, money, and talent. Don't waste your time and money on it either. If there was a zero rating, I'd give it a nothing because it's worthless."
1,Complete waste of celluloid,"Safe for Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance, this was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I want my money back."
1,Don't bother,This movie is absolutely terrible. Avoid it at all costs. I don't write reviews that often but this movie needs to have light shone on it for what an absolute piece of garbage it is.
2,Random Sequences of Epic Nothingness,"Let me first say, that all of these actors are strong. The characters they portray are deep, insightful, and refined (in the acting sense).....however....There is no cohesion to this story whatsoever. I understand what the movie is meant to be, and say, and leave to the imagination, but it's just not a pleasant ride to get there.There is no benefit for the audience to know what the characters do or do not discover within themselves.This movie failed to realize what it was trying to say..... I really did give it all the way until the end, waiting for 'Aha!', but honestly, it was only a yawnSorry, not feelin it"
1,Must be too high-brow for me,"My husband and I LOVE all aspects for movies, from directing to writing to editing to sound and then down to acting. We are definite cinema folk. However this movie was WAY too over-the-top for us. My husband kept nodding off and I kept hoping it would get better. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing, as usual, and Amy Adams is great. But other than the individual performances, we found this move to be a big mess. I'm not a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson (didn't like Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, Magnolia), but I was hoping I'd like this film. Evidently I need to just stay away from his movies altogether."
3,"Fast S&H, But # Wrong for F 150","Very fast shipping, but the filter is wrong due to Fram system! This filters male fuel lines are not the correct diameter. Checked with Ford dealer and allall 2008 F150 motors have the same # filter which has larger diameter lines than 8018. It is a glitch in the system not the sellers fault!"
2,does not fit,"i have a 98 ford f150 and when i ordered it it said it fit. now, when i check back it says it doesnt. im going to use it and make it work but i hate having to jerry-rig things to get them to work. at least they have fixed the site, too bad it was after i ordered it."
4,It's a fuel filter.,"What can I say, it's a fuel filter that works as well as any of the others. Fit up is good.Bob"
5,something very interesting,This was the first time i heard Kagel music (wow). To my ears this never gets boring.
3,"great, but...","A brief note for those considering this CD: it is the most brilliantly recorded sitar music I've ever heard, as if it were playing in your room, and the performances are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it is a live recording and the extensive chatting between the musicians is also brilliantly well recorded. Talk about buzzkill. Ragas reward careful listening, and that's difficult with a couple of guys talking in your ear. Perhaps they need to hunt down the mythical Glenn Gould filter. Fortunately, they do zip up for long periods, but be forewarned."
4,"VERY WELL WRITTEN, I ENJOYED IT!!",I have never read a book written by Sarah Lovett before this one. I enjoyed it so much that I am buying her other books as well.
1,BAD!,"I discovered Sarah Lovett in a local bookstore and thought I might try her out! BIG MISTAKE! Boring plot, bad characters, and it could have been a lot shorter! Hopefully her next books are better!"
2,Code examples are broken,"The code examples have lots of errors which prevent compiling. I managed to fix them myself, but I don't want to be doing that as I read the book."
4,"It works but, you have to know what you're doing","I must say... i havent completly read it. But anyway, the book is ok, the author talks not only about the subject but also give advices about working as a game programmer and in the end suggests a lot of books to continue learning.The reason of the title of this review is because you have to actually have a solid base of c++ wich means that you must have the ability to read and understand code on your own even when the author explains it well because some examples can be a bit confusing if you don't."
5,A good start point to DirectX programming,"I just begin to read this book. I must confess that I buyed it for curiosity, but I found it a nice introduction to DirectX programming. It isn't the solution to became a skilled game programmer, but for me it's a step to begin programming under Win32. Until today I just programmed using plain DOS ambient (DJGPP), or Linux (GCC,TCC), without any evolved graphic library or something similar (writing on myself all low level graphic functions). Now it's time to explore this new world..."
1,Beginners beware...,"I bought this book with a fairly good grasp of C++. It started out ok, but quickly got very complex, and alot of the detail about what's going on in the programs wasn't covered. I was doing fine up to bitmaps and surfaces, but when he started going into animated sprites, he lost me because it seemed like he jumped from one thing to the other without first explaining what he was doing. There were new lines of code introduced that weren't used before, and he failed to explain what they were for.He also failed to give any answers to the end of chapter exercises, so I was left wondering how to solve the more complex problems.Also, some end of chapter questions were about topics covered in later chapters, so I ended up beating my head against the wall trying to find the answers.I just ordered the Sams beginning game programming book, and hopefully that will shed some light on what I've read so far with this book."
5,Dont listen to the others,"Hey guys this book is awesome. People don't know what they're talking about when they write these reviews. This book is great, especially the latest edition. It has a lot of information and it can help start your game programming career. The people who complain about the author talking about 3d rendering are really unknowledgable. Why would he teach you 2d rendering but not 3d? You are learning Directx3d. What if you wanted to make a game with a few 3d objects in it? Also, it is a great intro to 3d programming when you finish this book. And for those who don't understand it, don't give it full attention. This book is very clear in its intentions and the author has an amazing writing style. Just make sure to buy a book about c++ before starting to read this or you won't get it. Thanks Jonathan for this great book!"
1,Confusing and not very well written.,"I was very disappointed with this book. There was insufficient instruction regarding the installation of the DirectX SDK. Most of the source code is incompatible with the included compiler. After manually entering the source code into the Visual C++ IDE, most of the programs would not compile. Thinking I may have made some typographical errors or overlooked some of the code, I then copied the source code directly from the included CD and became even more frustrated that this code would not compile either. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Ok book but some BIG drawbacks,"Besides the few mistakes that make it difficult to compile code etc. the book is very good for beginners. It starts with the basics of windows programming framework then adds DirectX, onto 2d graphics then finishes with 3d. Each chapter has questions to test your knowledge and it CLEARLY states the answers are in the Appendix which ISN'T included. I have contacted them and they just state, ""nope no appendix sorry"". So if you are unsure of an answer your never going to know the answer. It also has a program he uses called meshview which doesn't come with ALL SDK's (maybe I have a newer one that has it removed). So the whole section on optimizing mesh's is worthless to me (I have searched for it on the SDK ON THE BOOK's CD!! and online to no avail) Things like that throughout the book make it just a so so book to me. Anyhow don't expect a complete 100% thorough book."
3,Difficult to understand,"This book has exellent information, but the author spends little time emphasizing the basics. I am about halfway through the book and i have just stopped reading it becuase it is so confusing. I am very experienced in php, and know basic C and C++, and was surprized i found it so difficult to understand. If you can catch on quick enough though then im sure the information given is great, i expecially loved the first few chapers before the code, where he explained about api's and how directx works..."
1,Very fragile surface,"I bought this pan about a year ago and loved the way it looked and cooked. I guess I got it a little too hot on the burner or didn't wash it correctly but after a while it stopped being non stick. Read closely the ""Lifetime Warranty."" There are a lot of compliance requirements and they mean what they say. I'm very tempted to put it in the garbage but I need it to remind me that just because something is expensive it doesn't mean it's top quality."
2,Irritating and Disruptive,"I found the music to be irritating - sharp pitched notes would disrupt my chain of thought. Perhaps if I played it quietly it wouldn't be as bad, but I need white noise to cover other people's noise (vacume cleaner, loud TV, etc). All in all, a waste of money, since I have other programing to listen to when I'm not studying. I'll stick to Kelly Howell (Deep Learning), Brainwave Mind Voyages (Subliminal Learning Genius), Global Hypnosis (Super Learning, Malibu Hypnosis (Study Smart Study Longer Self Hypnosis Sound Therapy), and Dr. Rick Collingwood (Super Study [Volume Sixteen]) - Sorry, Amazon dosn't make product links for mp3."
2,Not what I expected,"I expected to hear music that would help me stay focused and concentrate while reading (as the other reviews state will happen) but I didn't notice much difference, and some of the titles were hard to listen to - annoying actually. Definitely not the resource I'd hoped it would be after reading the other reviews."
3,very old recording very good quality,"tracks 1-6 recorded in 1947 what can you say, if your looking for rome or berlin quality live recording forget it.shallow hollow sound not remastered but the intangibles of her very youthful voice are wonderful. 7-13 quality of duets with louis armstrong very nice.recording better but not verve standard. might be the prototype for their later work. the earliest i've ever heard of them together and the song selection is nice.if your like me trying to find those rare gems amongst her huge recorded catalogue this is worth the used price for sure but not a five star gem."
2,It's Okay,"I wanted to try 4711 as I've read it's a lovely fragrance. To my nose, the fragrance is remarkably similar to Jean Nate, though much more expensive. This body wash is Okay, as body washes go. However, what scent might be in the wash disappears rather quickly. Actually this is a good thing, as I find this particular scent to be rather strident. I far prefer body washes which are far less costly and which don't have any fragrance...just a nice clean smell.The 4711 bar soap is actually rather pleasant, and has a fine lather, not enormous bubbles as do some soaps."
5,Reduces Clutter,"I have used Keyspans individual port adapters for several years. They work flawlessly and are quite fast. I do a lot of work on high speed serial devices running without flow control. The devices keep up.I found that I often had 4 single Keyspans cluttering my desk. I wanted this device. When I finally found it, it was a no-brainer. It works flawlessly. (I had hoped it would be less expensive than 4 singles - and it is - just a little.)A nice little benefit is I use their static mapping tool to make the ports appear as COM11 thru COM14, eliminating past confusion about which port goes with which device.Serial is officially a legacy device. New PCs don't have serial ports. But, if you have a lot of serial devices to manage, this is a great way to simplify cabling and management hassles."
5,Works just like it is supposed to!,Unit installs easily. Just run the CD disc to install the software then plug it in to your computer and connect the serial ports. Nothing to it. And most importantly - it works just like it is supposed to.
1,4 Port BSOD machine,Their drivers are unstable and often cause BSODs on win7 x64 on several machines.Their driver is labeled beta and dated at 2007 (downloaded from their site April 2012).It's fine if sending small amounts of data. Not good for production testing.
1,Obsolete,The unit was shipped with outdated drivers. I had to obtain the current drivers from the manufacturer. The current drivers ended up conflicting with other drivers which caused the computer to become very unstable. I deleted the drivers and am back to square one. So far I am unable to use this device and have not been able to reach tech support. A big disappointment and a waste of money and time!
4,Good reading,"I thought this book was pretty good reading. It does not really get into good shooting practice much, but more on history of long range competitions it seems. All in all, I thought it was a good book."
3,Very good insite,This book provided me with the basic information about long distance shooting. There are various authors that describe their experiences with this type of shooting. A good book for the beginner to determine whether this is a field that they would like to continue to explore.
1,Disapointed,"I am very pleased with the content of the book, but the book arrived very badly damaged in transit. Apparently the envelope wasn't too bad, so my wife threw it out, but the book had been folded and had a huge gouge in the back cover. I really wish I knew how to get it replaced."
3,It's a good reminder and referance.,"I wish I could give this book a better review, but I can't seem to hang on to it long enough to read the whole thing! Some one always has to borrow it from the last person it went to. What I have been able to read is on the money and good information.I guess to be fair to the author, I'm going to have to buy another one and hide it when company comes over."
1,Almost Entirely Useless,"Interact in the past has had a history of excellent accessories for all systems, but boy did they mess this one up. The pad feels awkward, and heavy. The layout of the regular controller for the 64 is annoying enough this one however is downright inexcusable. Unless you are absolutely too poor to spend the money on an official controller stay right away from this pad"
4,Works as designed,Used this product on a cabin roof that had never had any ventilation. It along with some gable vents has made a big difference in the attic area.
1,"nice music, no future money","I don't see how this CD will prosper anyone's life, let alone add money to their bank accounts. For one thing I don't believe that subliminal messages spoken at below the thresh-hold of consciousness works for me. I got to listen to inspirational songs, hear speeches, do exercises and apply some strategies for turning my life around. Buy this CD because you like the music, but I think anyone who believes that this CD will make themselves rich is just fooling themselves."
5,awesome,steven halpern doesn't fail... his work brings me tremedous peace...i would recommend any of his cds...
5,Attracting Prosperity,It really works. I have been looking for a CD like that and finally found one. I recommend it highly.
3,Music was kind of cheesy -,"I love Steven Halpern's music -- so my expectations were a bit high. There seemed to be a lot of harp 'runs' -- (strumming low to high to low to high and back again) making it seem somewhat cartoonish of Heaven. I listened to it in my car both on the way to work and home -- for several weeks, trying to give it a chance -- kept my vibration high -- haven't seen a change in the prosperity yet. I'm still hopeful. I still listen to the CD when I feel I need something relaxing, though."
2,"A good warm up, definately not cardio","I just bought this DVD this evening because in my mind it was marketed as THE workout the pussycat dolls use, and I thought ""hey, why not try it!"" I'm fairly disappointed. While it is slightly entertaining and I enjoy learning the dance moves, I'd hardly call it a cardio workout... I barely got my heart rate up (and I don't work out all THAT much!!) I highly doubt this is the workout the pussycat dolls use to ""get in shape."" It goes through several dance routines and then shows suedo-performances. Bottom line: If you're looking to lose weight, or for a hard-core aerobic/cardio workout, look elsewhere."
3,naughty dance,this is not an intense cardio work out but it's fun and entertaining. It will definitely help you spice up your life
3,Video,"Not sure yet, have not used it enough to give a thumbs up or thumbs down; perhaps after the holidays"
2,Doesn't do it for me!,I am really not crazy about this dvd at all.CONS__________1. Didn't feel like I got a good workout in at all.2. Didn't feel like it was pussycat doll dance routines or moves.3. I got through the whole dvd without water or a break on the first time.4. It is just kind of a bunch of sk*nky club dance moves.Pros___________The music is alright? I don't really know.
2,FYI This DVD is not very good at all.,"I love to dance, so I picked up this video thinking it would be a fun way to work out. Boy was I wrong. Its very boring, it takes them forever to teach you the moves, then you go through it fast paced a few times and you are on to the next one. I used it once, got halfway through and shut it off. I dont know why they would ever describe this as a workout. If i were you I would shell out the extra 5 bucks and get a better fitness DVD."
4,Great! If you already have some dance background!,"Amazing workout and tons of fun! But I do not recommend it for beginner dancers. The moves are not simple box steps and the breakdowns are still taught pretty fast. However, it will get you moving and sweating!"
3,Pusscat dolls workout,"its an ok video, u do have to try and pick up on the moves. they do go over it with you, but if your not that great of a dancer, could be fustrating to pick up. But it is a fun video! Felt like the warm up in the video isnt much of a warm up. i would suggest you do your own warm up then the videos."
2,EASY,"I bought this DVD thinking it was going to be a real workout and I was very dissapointed. This workout was to easy, and not a good workout."
4,ONLY THE SEXY NEED APPLY,"I found this workout routine for people that are sexy at heart. For me, I put on sexy similar outfits (Things I would never where to a real gym, boyshorts and a tank top), to make me feel part of the group. Hopefully when I get a little more practice in I will have the nerve to pull the routine off in front of my husband, :). I did this for the first time yesterday and I am waking up with sore legs, back and stomach muscles. I read another ladies review and YES you should probably be a smaller stature or flexible to pull of this routine. Must be able to squat to floor and get up, be able to reach ""under"" self, and workout in heels (I would say the higher the heels the better the work out). Biggest flaw, is this routine probably does get old. Most of the workout comes from repeating moves while learning them, once you learn the routine it will probably lose it excitement."
3,OK for the money,Not much of a workout but the dances are cute to learn. More of a fun low impact workout than a calorie burner.
3,Ridiculously short routines...,"Let me start by saying that I love the Pussycat Dolls and against my better judgment and the reviews of the others, I purchased 4 copies of this DVD for myself and some of my friends.Now, after doing the routines on the video three times, I'm totally bored and can't imagine someone doing the ""workout"" everyday as Robin recommends. The routines are cute and fun, but they are extremely too short and it's just too darn repetitive! I don't understand why Robin spends 14 minutes teaching a routine that once its learned is literally 17 seconds long. Huh??? I'm by no means a professional dancer, but even a toddler would pick this up after a couple of tries. Like why waste valuable recording time repeating a 2 step routine? There's nothing to retain! Bend over on 1, slap your booty on 2!I'm returning the 3 DVDs that I haven't opened back to Amazon. As I think my friends will just think that this is way too cheesy and will get bored after one viewing..."
2,Disappointed a little,"The girls are not PCD which was a bummer would have liked it better to see the PCD teaching steps. Otherwise if you just want to learn dance moves it is okay, I still use it today."
3,It was good,I liked it but I thought it was longer. It doesnt contain that much music. But I like that is a good workout and I enjoy doing it everynight
1,Not worth it and wish I could return it,"It was an impulse buy. I am big enough to admit that. I love the PCD music and thought with the way that they dance, this dvd would give me a good workout. I was very disappointed. The moves are simplistic and repeated way too much. There was nothing exciting about the way it was done. I was hoping that the dance sequence would show the way they did with their chair dance in ""Buttons"" or at least the fast moves they did. But there was nothing that from this video that I couldn't have gotten from watching their youtube videos. I wish that I could get my money back but since the video has been watched no such luck. I should have gone for the Prevention exercise dvd. PCD, you are hot but this dvd was so not."
1,Not for me!!,"I know who PCD is, but this video was a little too much for me. My 12 year old son was in the room with me when I was previewing the dvd to see what it consisted of. I asked him to leave the room when they were doing the introductions. I'm in my thirties, don't consider myself a prude, but this video is awful. There was very little instruction, just ""naughty"" dance moves and the girls showcasing their PCD dance skills."
1,Review of Workout DVD,"This is not what I would call a ""workout"" dvd. I was expecting to see excercise to music and all it showed were the girls bouncing around doing the same moves over and over. Not very impressive!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"It's already been said, but I was so disappointed, I still had to add my two cents! Couldn't even watch this until the end the first time around. Not much of a workout, until you're a 70 year old woman who has never worked out before in her life...but then I don't think you would be choosing the Pussycat Dolls for your first time. Virtually no choreography--just a bunch of botox- and silicone-injected pubescent females writhing to lame music. Tried to augment the workout on my own, but still couldn't even work up a sweat. Maybe I just couldn't get over the size of Robin Antin's lips!!! Let's just say the Pussycat Dolls don't stay in shape by doing THIS workout. Sorry I wasted $10.49 on this crap."
1,WTF?,"I guess I thought this was going to be a real work out tape, my mistake this is more suited to a teenage boy."
1,RIP OFF..NEVER RECEIVED THE DVD,I NEVER RECEIVED THE VIDEO! I CONTACTED AMAZON AND THE SELLER HAS NEVER EMAILED OR CONTACTED ME IN ANY WAY! I AM HIGHLY UPSET ABOUT IT. AND YES... I WAS CHARGED FOR A VIDEO I NEVER RECEIVED.
3,This is NOT a workout DVD!,"If you want to learn a couple of PCD moves and play like you're in a music video, get this and have some fun. If you want a serious workout, this is greatly disappointing. Robin Antin is a fantastic choreographer, but she's not a fitness instructor. The routines for each of the 3 songs are about 1 minute long and she thinks by doing them over and over you'll get a workout. No Robin, you get bored! The least she could do is provide a routine that lasts an entire song! Presenting this as a workout is just silly. The warm up and cool down are the closest things that come to exercise. The rest could just be saved for a laugh at a bachelorette party."
2,Boring,"I am not really athletic person, and I am not in a great shape, recently after pregnancy. I haven't worked out for quite a bit and this work out barely made me sweat. Plus it was quite boring and very repetitive. For person like me any better work out probably would cause some sore muscles, etc, but this did not. If you want fun and little more sweat, I would suggest Carmen Electra's striptease workout. I used disc No 1, it was really much easier to repeat, and I sweat a lot more, and got a little of sore muscles in my legs next day. And Carmen has much better and warmer personality than Robin from PCD."
1,Waste of money,"This video is dumb. Its not really a good workout like the Jillian Michaels workout dvds. Its like a video to teach you some moves to maybe impress at a club or some moves to show off to your boyfriend or husband, but not for intense weight loss."
4,Guilty Pleasure :),"I'll admit, this isn't the hardest or the classiest workout I've ever done...but it's freakin' FUN.I do feel the burn the next day, but I'm not in super-awesome shape, and I've also been playing a lot of Just Dance II.I would recommend this DVD for someone who isn't already fit and who loathes exercise. It goes by pretty fast because it's fun and silly :)"
3,Jb,i opened the video lastnight and the warm up was great i thought okay people are wrong im starting to feel my heart rate going up and the dont cha dance moves and the whole performance great again.. but then Burlesque-Style oh heck nawww didnt like tht at all and i dont hv ff button on my dvd player so i didnt even make it to buttons. wld have given this a 4 if buttons wld have been second so i cld just take the video out and not wry with burleque but all and all the first part of the video made me sweat and buttons probably wld have to.. maybe i will play it again tonight and make sure the other song just plays on through lol ps wld not do this in front of anyone else in my house hold
2,What was I thinking?,"The first time I put this DVD in, I had hopes that it would be fun and I'd get some kind of workout as I'm not someone who likes to walk on a treadmill for an hour. First of all - the women in this video are dumb as dirt. Nothing turns me off more than woman acting dumb and trashy. I know what you're saying. It is the PUSSYCAT DOLLS, so what did I expect? Second - the routine only lasts about 10 minutes, so you don't even have time to work up a sweat. I actually laughed so hard at myself for even attempting to take this seriously, and that may have burned off a few calories.Save your money. You can probably turn on MTV, copy some moves and get just as good a workout that way. Ugh."
4,Haters be haters,"I used this video with two of my sisters and we all had a blast and it WAS effective. I included this in part of my routine and it helped me drop 40 pounds in three months. I lost at least two pounds in the weeks of using just this video. Have fun with it, relax, keep it tight and it's a GREAT workout."
4,Be prepared to sweat,"I will admit; I was skeptical of this DVD. From the moment I popped it in and started moving, I was drenched with sweat within the first five minutes!Needless to say, the DVD never left my player! The moves are easy to do and it really does boost your confidence! THIS DVD ROCKS!!!!"
3,IT's fun and not much of a workout,"I just bought this DVD yesturday and tried it today. It was fun, I felt a little workout and enough to make me sweat. Although it was not enough. The routines are fun and easy and I think it is great motivation to see the pussycat dolls, cause I think about myself looking like that and feeling great. If you really want a workout get brazilian butt lift , P90, or Insanity."
3,"Good Enough, Needs a Follow-Up","As someone who dances half the time to workout, the moves in this DVD are sexy, fun and yes increase your heartbeat. You will unleash your inner doll but this will not make you look like a Pussycat Doll.PCD needs follow-up DVD of actual toning and cardio DVD's, might as well make a colletion, and as long as they're around, I'm sure they'll do it in due time."
3,I Found It So-So,"I love to do dance workouts, and this one looked fun, so I decided to try it. Well...I think it would have been better if they had described it as a dance tutorial rather than a ""workout"". The dance steps themselves were challenging to learn, but it wasn't a very good workout. Certain moves, like a kickbox-style roundhouse kick, were repeated only on the left side. I switched between my left and right legs to get a more even workout, but it messed me up on the steps of the dance.The dance moves in this DVD are very overtly slutty, but I kept worrying that my husband would come in while I was struggling to copy the moves because, what could be worse than seeing one's wife in her grubby workout clothes, stumbling through a skanky dance routine and apparently trying to hump his necktie? i don't know. My husband is easygoing, but I still think I would be embarrassed.All in all, it was a kinky dance routine, but not really an efficient workout."
2,Cheap!,"The bodysuit is very thin and not made well. The neck opening hangs funny and it lost some of it's shape after washing. I wouldn't buy this again. The saying is cute and color is good, but quality of actual bodysuit is bad. Seller shipped quickly and was friendly."
5,Ancerl - The Gold Standard,"The Supraphon label has been doing an excellent job of reissuing large parts of their back catalog over the last few years. Not only are they releasing numerous performances with the Czech Philharmonic and visiting conductors like Kletzki, Markevitch, Matacic and Fournet, but they have also remastered (in 24/96) many of the recordings of conductor Karel Ancerl in a new series called the ""Gold Edition."" Volume 6 of this series features Ancerl and the Czech PO in a 1964 stereo recording of Mahler's Symphony No. 1, and a 1962 stereo recording of Strauss' Till Eulenspiegels tone poem. The performances are excellent, and Ancerl's Mahler compares nicely to more celebrated recordings by Kubelik, Bernstein and Walter. With quality discs such as this, I look forward to purchasing (and reviewing) more titles from the ""Gold Edition."""
4,A Good Read!,"This book, exhaustively researched and daunting to read, sums up all of the most important forces likely to concern a biotech marketer. The authors take a dispassionate, methodical approach, buttress their points with plenty of case evidence and examples, clearly have a grasp of the subject and communicate detailed knowledge of great value to those in the field. Unfortunately, their style is plodding and clinical, replete with passive constructions and impersonal, generally soporific sentences. We believe that those with a real need to know will be glad to brew some strong coffee and grateful to stay the course and become so thoroughly updated. Readers who are intrigued by the field - but not immersed in it - will benefit most from reading the introduction, the first three chapters and the conclusion."
5,This books makes the complex field transparent,"This books is likely to become a ""standard"" in the industry. It is innovative and comprehensive while providing a provocative perspective on biotechnology marketing strategies. The authors are able to make a complex field transparent to the reader."
4,It Wasn't That Bad!,"Even though I thought that sweetness was overdoing his gay roll, it had it's perks. It kept me awake and had me laughing to the point where I couldn't breathe. Especially when Big mama pulled the gun out on the girl and waltzed out in that zebra cat suit and the cast thought it was so funny, they forgot their lines and had the guy come out and tell them what was to be said next. The play has its ups and downs, but you gotta be in a certain mood to watch it."
3,"""Beauty Shop""","Beauty Shop"" stage play is fun to watch, you get some laughs from it. The sassy guy is quite a character!"
4,easy install,"Purchased for kid's room, went up without any problems and has been hanging now for about three months with no sign of peeling. I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because the beginning / ending of the strips may not necessarily match the start (or end) of the next strip, so you have to either get creative in how you line them up or you run the risk of losing a foot or so of material: trimming it enough to match the pattern at the point the last strip stopped.Overall I liked."
2,Oddities by Boris,"In general I find Boris Tchaikovsky compulsive listening - the piano concerto, the Sebastopol symphony, the chamber symphony, etc. Every encounter with his music is surprising; his inventiveness seems to have been practically unlimited - each work a new start.This film music is surprising too, not least because after a while - incredibly, for this composer - it begins to pall. It impacts like something between big-band jazz and musical, with a touch of Russian whimsy and soul. It's reminiscent in places of Kurt Weill, but Weill's irony was sharper; at times it sounds like Nino Rota, but Rota's ""circus music"" was more playfully ambiguous; and the jazz elements in Bernstein are more authentically swinging, of course.I'm sure this disc will hold great appeal for some - it's a curious sort of ""niche product"", but it presents a decidedly odd aspect of this still underrated composer."
4,still soft,"i had bought for a Christmas present along with two others though from a different seller, warm whiskers, i found that this one was not as nice as the warm whiskers just a little bit of a quality issue as for the bag inside that holds the lavender smelly good stuff is made of a nylon plastic type of fabric, that kinda of crunches when you grab, the other brands bag is made of a softer material. really not a big issue as i love these little animal eye pillows. i have not tried it the freezer yet only in microwave. works Great!"
4,Soothing and Adorable,"I was looking for something to take the stress off my forehead and eyes, and this cute little pillow did the trick!After heating it in the microwave for 15 seconds (20 in mine because our microwave is terrible) the pillow is super warm and has a soothing herbal aroma (definitely lavender with some kind of other herbs) that instantly relaxes me.The pillow is a little smaller than I'd like - it either covers my forehead or my eyes and about half my forehead, so minus a star for that. Also the space in between the tail and paw, where the nose goes, is a little tight but I have a big honker so that probably won't be an issue for other people.Overall, definitely worth it, especially considering the cute factor. Just know that it does run a bit small."
2,Not a patch on its predecessor,"The first Gift of Love album is inspiring, insightful and leads the listener on a series of adventures through inspired words and music, creating a deep connnection with something profoundly mystical.This second album is almost devoid of this depth and sadly, creates no connection. It seems like Deepak Chopra doesn't get that. There are a couple of very nice pieces but the album is mainly formulaic rather than insightful and I am dismayed to say leaves me feeling like I just listened to some music and nothing else.If you like nice unhurried music that creates a relaxed atmosphere, you can't go past Cafe Del Mar. If you're looking to experience a sense of something spiritual, stick to the first Gift of Love album."
1,Someone published this?,"The idea for a book dedicated to Post-1986 (P86) Fiestaware is a terrific idea and I was pleased to order it.What a poor execution! Racheter's attempt is inconsistent, sophomoric and diseased with his unceasing attacks on Homer Laughlin China Company. (Who cares why he hates Homer Laughlin? Not me!)The (little) new information and price guide for some P86 colors - the book's innovative features - are overshadowed by the pointless commentary.Unfortunately the book isn't worth keeping for the pictures either... Don't buy this book!..."
2,Wanting more....,"After dregging through the Post 86 Fiesta book, I found myself wanting more information. Certainly, the author adds many personal stories to the book, but actual content about Post 86 Fiesta is lacking. The photographs in the book leave much to be desired. The colors are not true and vary from picture to picture in the book itself. A true book about Post 86 Fiesta should include complete listings of all items available. The section on decal and specilaty pieces, i.e. the Warner Brothers Fiesta, is sadly lacking in information. For example, there is no information on what pieces where done with the image of Scooby Doo. Sadly, what could have been an excellent resource book for the Post 86 Fiesta collector is lost in a world of stories, poor photography, and side-line commentary by the author."
1,Poor Quality,"It looks cute but it is cheap plastic and a piece of paper for the picture, very chinsy looking."
3,"Great Show, Buy the Seasons Separately Though","It ends up that the 1st 5 seasons separately purchased end up being around $20 cheaper than this bundle. This show is amazing, but you could buy the South Park Movie DVD along with the seasons and it'd still be cheaper than this bundle."
1,twice the price,"Seasons 1-4 individually: $16.99Season 5 : $21.99Total Individually: $89.95Now, what was that price again? $174.99?riiiiight"
5,"I <3 Southpark, BUT......","I know prices on amazon change quite often, but it could save you $50 to look. I found this 5 season set for $175.00, but by buying each season individually it's around $125. Just a heads up.Still 5 Stars, because you can't really put a price on hours of laughter."
1,Not the same product that you would buy in store,"The picture for this product looks identical to what i had before that i got from my salon. When i received this product from Amazon, the container was blank and didn't have anything on it. I asked the buyer if this was the same product and he assured me that the company had just changed their packaging. After opening the product and trying it out i quickly realized this isn't the same at all. It's way more greasy and does not work as well the previous one. I even saved some of my old stuff and compared the texture and completely different. Im quite disappointed about this. Will definitely be way more careful when ordering things like this online. I ordered 3 of these at the same time from the buyer, and now i am stuck with crappy wax because he wouldn't take it back."
1,Sad cried when i saw it,Ordered this baby for my husband it was his late x mas present. When the tree arrived it was frozen and the canopy was down the leafs were all black. The tree is pretty much dead. We cried it was sad to watch how all the leafs were black the branches down. My husband pruned most of the nasty branches and leafs to see if that helps the tree any but at this point it looks like there is no coming back for it.
4,Good for Begginers,This is a good slingshot for the kids. It came with paintballs which we could have done without. It would have been nice to come with marbles or ball bearings but for the price it didn't really matter. Its as rugged as others in this price range.
