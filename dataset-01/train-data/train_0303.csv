5,GOOD FOR MY HEALTH,"This is said to be good for your health, beets that is. I do not like the taste of beets and this was the best way for me to get this into my system."
2,not for me,i am sure this might be good for some one else but every time i took a capsule i got an upset stomach
3,Not working,"I don't see any difference, my bp didn't even changed after taking this for 5 days since I got it. I've only added this supplement with my diet and exercise but the reading is still elevated at times. Maybe it's not for me."
3,"Review for One Year Bible, KJV","Delivery was more than prompt, approximately three days! But I ordered the same bible shortly afterward, the NIV One Year Bible and it is so much easier to understand than reading the old language version. This is a good bible, but I just prefer the other one, using current language pattern. Amazon purchases are always more than satisfactory, in my opinion! Delivery time is amazing!"
3,Book Purchase,"While we love The One Year Bible KJV, we were disappointed in the condition of the used one we bought here. It was advertised to be in better condition than it actually was. Normally, we have not had problems with items we have purchased here, however this was an unfortunate exception. Makes us leery of purchasing used items in the future."
2,Ouch.,"It was more about man love than bikes. Took a wrong turn into weirdsville. Didn't pay money to watch some guy kiss his barber. Complete mess right there. If I wanted to watch that crap i'd pay for cable. The scences about the bikes, where they are talking about the bikes were great. The scenes of man love were less than entertaining. I cannot see myself buying another one of their videos. It's very apperant the best scenes are on you tube."
4,Choppertown: The Sinners,"It's a documentaire, not a movie! But the way The Sinners are shown was very interesting. A bunch of people who are no sissies, but not a 'gang' in the way people think about bikers. It was a pleasure to watch and I can recommend it!"
5,Choppertown: The Sinners,One of the best motorcycle DVDs I've seen in years! Shows the life that most of us would love to live. I definitely recommend this DVD to any biker.
5,"It is about so much more than bikes, though the bikes rock!","I love this movie. There are so many things good to say about it, but perhaps the best thing about this is that they nailed what bikes are about. It is about brotherhood, hanging with your bros, loyalty.... The bikes are amazing, but you don't have to like bikes to identify with the movie. Anybody who cares about their friends will get something out of it."
2,Choppertown the Sinners,Overall the documentary was ok but did lack a certain something that kept you glued to your chair. I would not be in hurry to watch it again.
1,Kindle edition overpriced,"I loved this book. However, I did not buy it here. When I noticed the Mass Market Paperback was $2 less than the digital kindle edition, I got pissed off and got it out of the library. My willingness to buy books digitally for the convenience only lasts so long as I feel that I am not getting *completely* ripped off."
4,Funtastic!!,An abso-tively must read book. ;)I can't express how much I found this story refreshing. I love the writing style and the characters are just absolutely hilarious but in a way that makes you empathize with them all the more. I'm looking forward to picking up everything by this author.An incredible writer with a very fluid style I would love to see more of.
5,I love this book and here is why you should love it too,"What makes reading Neil Gaiman so enjoyable is his uniquely British sense of humour.Parts of this book had be cracking up, other parts made me say, ""Awwwwww"" as the scenes were just so sweet.This side novel to American Gods is filled with a variety of interesting, well drawn out characters. The best thing about this book is how Neil Gaiman can write about black characters without blundgening people over the head with their blackness.He simply weaves the culture into the novel in a seemless way. He's subtle, spping the web of this tale as if Ananazi himself was possessing him."
4,Slow going but fancinating.,"Took a while to get into it , but once there things began to fall into place. A real offbeat study of human behavior , good vs evil."
3,Just a story,"I just finished reading this book and although it was fun to read it (all Neil Gaiman stuff is), there wasn't much to the story. Rather, the story seemed too simple, not magical or otherworldly enough. I thought that character and location development were weak. I just recently read Neverwhere and I found it to be by far a much better ""story"" than Anansi Boys. I might have expected too much as I absolutely love Gaiman stuff...or it might just be a matter of taste."
5,Best of his books- most colorful characters,I have read almost all of Neil Gaiman's books.All of them are good but I personally liked this one the most.You fall in love with the story and the characters and settings are so exotic and colorful...What does Neil Gaiman see when he looks at the world?I want to see that!
3,Disappointing,"Anansi stories derive from Jamaican folklore. Gaiman has expounded on those stories and brought them into the modern world with only limited success. I never reviewed ""American Gods"" but I would have given it 5 stars. Had I not read ""American Gods"", I may have given this novel 4 stars, but I know that Gaiman is capable of so much better. It's a nice effort and a great premise, but it never fully gels. I don't believe the characters or situations. A great fantasy novel sucks you into its world and you believe the characters and plot. A mediocre one feels forced. Have not given up on Gaiman though. Plan to read more of his work."
2,Not nearly as good as Amercian Gods,"I will admit that maybe I bought this book with high expectations. I had just finished ""American Gods"" and thought it to be one of the better books I've ever read.Anansi Boys just doesn't stack up. The story is much more modest in scope, and the story isn't especially compelling. The character development is on par with an average sitcom. Considering the other works of Neil Gaiman that I've read, this was a major disappointment.This might have made a good - if predictable - episode of the Twilight Zone, but the quality here is way, way below Neil Gaiman's previous work.I sense that someone at the publishing company waved a lot of money under Neils nose while saying ""Give me a sequel to American Gods and make it snappy."""
2,DIsappointing,"Haven't read all his books, but this one was a big let down from Neverwhere. Everything seemed to fit together too neatly. Explanations for events weren't believable or were non-existant. I would have given it only one star, but it was just interesting enough to read through to the end. Don't buy it, borow it from the library - if you must. Personally, I suggest skipping it altogether."
3,It didn't excite me..,"Fat Charlie is an accountant who loves his normalcy and can't wait to get married to his fiancee Rosie. After discovering he has a brother, Spider, he becomes curious and wants to meet him. Spider is everything Charlie is not, handsome, cool etc. But after inviting Spider into his life he is very difficult to extricate.I found Anansi Boys to be merely okay. Fat Charlie (I can't stand the nickname), was just too much of a sad sack for me to get into. The humor (lets make Fat Charlie look as stupid as possible), just added to my dislike of this book. I don't really like to read about the protagonist constantly getting humiliated and made a dupe of. What's so exciting, amusing about that? Spider interested me until he became interested in Rosie.Meh. 3 Stars. Not my thing I guess."
4,"Slow to start, but it gets better.","Heck yeah, lime. The true star of the novel is the lime. Without question or doubt. Where would the plot have been without it? Nowhere, that's where. The sequel will hopefully be titled: Limeade: The Quest for More Citrus."
3,"Good, but not good enough","""Anansi Boys"" was disappointing. Not because it was a bad book -- rather, because it was an okay book. ""American Gods"" was great, and it set my expectations very high for Gaiman as a writer. It had wit, humor, novelty, noir, suspense -- and still remains one of my favorite books. But most importantly, it was fresh and inspiring. On the other hand, while reading ""Anansi Boys"" I couldn't shrug off a sensation that I'm reading a hybrid of ""American Gods"" (the ""gods"" motive) and ""Neverwhere"" (displacement/change in life motive). It was enjoyable -- Gaiman is a very talented writer, and his style is exquisite. But unfortunately, he didn't have too many new and brilliant ideas for ""Anansi Boys"""
4,Good--very enjoyable--but not Great,"Perhaps my expectations are too high, as I've followed Gaiman's work for years and feel he's the one of the brightest stars to rise, but I've not been blown away by his past two books, and find them somehow less than Neverwhere and his collection of short stories, Smoke and Mirrors, both of which I thought were some of the finest examples of fantasy literature of the past two centuries (easy to say since it's only 2005!). Primarily, I found it hard to root for the protagonist, as he lacks energy. The reader finds out he's like that because he lost something, which he eventually regains, so to speak, but all that aside, it's still hard to root for the guy. As such, one never really becomes enthralled by the book.Still, I read it in about three days, which isn't typical of me these days, and I enjoyed it.And, Neil, we want to go to Faery more, in whatever form you care to provide."
4,Brotherly Love/Hate,"Every once in awhile it is great to change your perspective and break the laws of science. This story gives you that chance and keeps enough plausibility that you have to stop and think a little about the possibilities. Is it possible for gods to live amongst us? Are these gods responsible for both good and bad things that happen to us? These questions pop up while reading this book, but at the same time it is a funny story with good moral issues involved. This is a true story of brotherly love/hate."
2,Awful characters,"Gaiman has succeeded in writing one of the least likeable protagonists in the world in Anansi Boys. There are no redeemable qualities about Fat Charlie, and after hearing about how much of a loser he was for 200 pages I returned this book to the library. The other characters aren't much better: the wife who does pretty much nothing except be charmed by the handsome men, and Charlie's brother who has no negative qualities at all."
4,Up & Coming Author,"Anansi boys is a fun, beach read type of book. Gaiman does a good job of keeping you on your toes and interested. Still, I found the book on the predictable side; a fact that takes away from the interest of the plot line.Otherwise, Gaiman has great charm, and some very funny moments. I'm going to watch him as an author. I predict that as he develops his style, he'll get to be an amazing author!"
2,Better luck next time.,"I'll not bore you. The main characters stunk, and it's the biggest reason why I didn't enjoy the book. The narrative was boring and terribly unfunny. It was embarrasssing to read it, considering that I do admire Mr. Gaiman so much. A chore to read, indeed."
2,What's the point?,"Judging from some of the reviews on here, I must be the minority who didn't enjoy this book. I am very hesitant to write a review unless it is positive, but I was suprised that this one didn't live up to my expectations. I've been wanting to try Neil Gaiman for some time, so I picked this. I really really liked the first several chapters. The writer interested me in his characters, and the writing was top notch. After a while, I was completely lost and had no idea what was going on. I had a vague idea, but I no longer cared. I happened to buy the audiobook, which is probably the best reading I've ever heard, but I admit I fastforwarded all the way to the end after hitting the half-way point of the book and no longer being able to tolerate it. Not that this author is untalented, I just don't know what the point of this story is. I have enough faith that I'd recoomend to you, and to myself, trying another of his novels."
2,I really wanted to like this...,"Neil is my favorite author, so I read this twice to make sure I wasn't missing something the first time around. This book has none of the mystery+humor that makes his other books worth reading. The plot reads like it was conceived as it was written (or like a Dean Koonz novel, you pick which is worse)."
1,Couldn't get through it.,"I have read many of Gaiman's other books and liked them, a lot. Anansi Boys was a huge disappointment for me, twice. I tried to read it years ago and put it down due to lack of interest. Picked it back up and started over recently and got halfway through before I couldn't take it anymore. Boring."
1,Bucking That Tide,"I probably should not be writing a review for a book I did not even finish, but I want to spare other readers the agony and the money. Generally, writers get better as their careers progress, but Neil Gaiman is bravely bucking that tide by getting worse."
4,Wow.,"This is where I have to be honest. Until I'd read Anansi Boys, I'd only read two other books by Gaiman before: Stardust and The Graveyard Book. I adored both. He has this writing style and imagination that can inspire so much for many. I took too long in picking up more of his work, and I regret it. Now I'm on a mission to start collecting and reading any and everything he ever has put out and will put out.Anansi Boys was an odd story of family, mythology, fantasy, and humor. I laughed out loud a few times. It was fun. It was vivid. It was charming. I couldn't put it down. I'm so glad that I found my way into reading more of Gaiman's work. There'll definitely be more of his books filling my shelves in the near future.<3Pixie"
2,If only.....,"If only this novel was a good as all the hype I'd of been very happy. I myself hoped after reading Gaiman's ""American Gods"" that his follow up novel would be an improvement upon it. As it so happens I find it's not even as good as ""Gods"", which I rated as a 3 star read. This in my view only get's a 2 star award. Nothing wrong with the writing and the story has a few funny passages that made me laugh. The problem is the story for me, It just didn't grip me and I've held back from posting a review for a few weeks so as to resist diving in with a bad review. I wanted to reflect about the story and I'm afraid that I still feel dissapointed with ""Anansi Boys"". I'm hoping I find Gaiman's collection of stories ,""Fragile Thing's"", the 5 star Gaiman book I'm waiting for."
2,Disappointing,"I've very much enjoyed most of Mr. Gaiman's other books, but have to admit I found this difficult to get through and not much worth the effort. What separated Gaiman from other writers, I feel, is his ability to create and describer an atmosphere in which the characters live. This seemed stunted and rushed and, as others have said the characters themselves were not compelling. Hopefully this is an aberration and not a sign of diminished works going forward."
2,Disappointing.,"Good Writing, as usual, but he relies on too many clichés and coincidences to keep the story going. If you strip all the classic Gaiman elements, the story is pretty dull."
3,Confusing but Passable,"Gaiman takes the opportunity of Anansi Boys to do what he usually does: mash up a lot of mythologies and make confusing statements about the collective unconscious of mankind. The conceit in this story is that the African spider god Anansi has died, leaving two sons behind to sort out the mess. One is fully aware of his lineage and potential, while the other is a nearly worthless slob living a mundane life. Hilarity ensues.The actual drama of the novel is not thrilling, nor particularly insightful or fascinating. An old enemy of Anansi resurfaces to take his revenge on the sons, while the sons travel through worlds of apparently Jungian origin. Every build up of tension is released with a confusing bit of magic and with questionable logic. It's too bad, really. Gaiman's characters are best when they are humans dealing with a fantastic world, not when they are fantasy creatures in a fantastic or semi-fantastic world."
5,Wonderful!,:) I really enjoyed this book. I think the whole story line is really creative and I was glad it had a happy out come for everyone.
3,Not an American Gods sequel,"Was really hoping for an American Gods sequel. This is my third Gaiman book; the second being American Gods which was great. American Gods showed me what Gaiman is capable of and Anansi Boys just fell short of his abilities. It wasn't bad, just not excellent."
4,Imaginative Fantasy,"Mr. Gaiman possesses the knack of creating multiple interesting characters from all walks of life, stringing them along on a wild journey of a fairytale, and bringing them all together for the conclusion. He is not afraid to kill off a character because even as a ghost the personality plays a great role in the story. It is a tale of a person - son of a cunning African god, to be exact - discovering his true self as he ambles through life's many stumbles. His ordinary calm life turns chaotic when the father dies and a previously unknown brother refuses to leave him be. Mr. Gaiman's language is compelling while his wit and perceptive writing entertaining. The fiction may be lengthy but each page is filled with undeniably immense happenings thus making the book a pleasurable read. The ending is a little bit sentimental but it is narrated with a nimbleness of an adept raconteur."
3,"If you like Neil Gaiman's writing, it's a good purchase","Neil Gaiman is a great writer (and if he ever gave up writing, he definitely would not having trouble getting a job as an audiobook reader. He is extremely talented at reading his own work and it feels like a whole troupe of readers) Unfortunately, he spends too much time writing just children's stories.Compared to other book I have listened to from this author, this was was just an ok book. It get's a little tedius and is somewhat predictable. Not on par with Neverwhere, or Stardust but worth listening to if you like his writing."
3,"Stick with it, it gets there...","Had it not been for some of the other reviewers comments, and the love that I've had for Mr. Gaiman's other stories, I might not have gotten past the beginning of this one. It picks up a bit, and the distaste that I felt for Charlie, etc. (hard to say without spoiling), passed, but I'm still not particularly enthusiastic about this story (in great contrast to American Gods and Neverwhere). Too much of Charlie's discomfort projects; sometimes reading this feels like watching a train wreck."
4,"Once you get past the beginning, it's good.","For a large portion of this book, I was thinking ""It's enjoyable. It's sort of like a less engaging American Gods.""Because I do that sort of thing in my head--build descriptions of what I'm reading or listening to or watching by creating one of those pastiches made entirely of clippings from magazines. Anyway.It was enjoyable, and once we got past the rocky part at the beginning where our protagonist was foisting his power and agency off on anybody walking past and I nearly tossed the book aside, I was liking it and looking forward to what came next. I was worried that I could see what was coming, and to some extent I was right. But for the important things, I was delightfully wrong. And the last couple of chapters, from Fat Charlie's big number on I'd say, were lovely. Which is nice, because endings can be a real bear.So there you have it--four wags from Uncle Coyote."
4,Very enjoyable,"I definitely enjoyed the book. Gaiman is funny and unpredictable, but still ties up the loose ends, which I appreciate. This is a good story of a very unusual father and two very unusual sons, and how they all manage to relate to each other."
2,At 25% through the book this would have been 5 stars...,"At 50% it would have been 4 stars...75% 3 stars...80% 2.5....100% 2.I just thought since I heard so much about Mr. Gaiman's books being so great that I figured I would give Anasi Boys a go.The writing at the beginning of the book sucked me in, but towards the end I just got so tired of Gaiman trying to put a neat little bow on a ridiculous package that I just went to the end to find out what happened. I very rarely, if ever, do that with books but this one just DRAGGED on and on.The character development also was a bit lackluster since there really was no depth to the characters other being super ordinary people thrown into a crazy magical situation that was trying to weakly tie it to African mythology.I might give Gaiman the benefit of the doubt and try another one of his books, but this one was a real disappointment."
3,Pretty cool,"A cool sort-of follow-up or prequel to American Gods, which I really enjoyed. It was a fast and easy read. Some of the fantasy stuff was a little ""off"" for me, but I found the story and the characters and their relationships interesting. It was fun, and it triggered a need to go back to American Gods and refresh myself about the Anansi appearance in that book."
4,Higher Standards,"I've come to appreciate Neil Gaiman's use of dark British humour together with insatiably touching Moments ever since I first read Neverwhere several years ago.Being a story about an African trickster god and his bloodline, Anansi Boys can't be the dark epic that American Gods -- focusing largely on the Norse All-Father, Odin -- was; I missed a certain level of interwoven coherence that Gaiman's led me to expect. Regardless, it's still a very entertaining read, and had any other author made me cry ""only"" once in a book, they'd have earned a 5."
4,Nice way to escape reality for a bit,"Fat Charlie was dubbed so by his dad when just a chubby child. Unfortunately, even though he shed the pounds the name stuck. Many years later Fat Charlie is living an unremarkable life, with a crappy job and a girlfriend who insists on making him ""wait until marriage"". When Charlie's dad dies he learns some amazingly unbelieveable things and his boring life is forever changed.This one has a lot of wit and was just offbeat enough to hold my attention. Charlie is an every-guy sort of character who is easy to like as he bumbles his way through some very odd changes in his life. The book is populated with interesting people and takes a lot of twists and turns that aren't expected. Gaiman wrote it and it reads like a twisted fairy-tale so how can you go wrong with that?"
4,"A good read, but not quite as great as Neverwhere","I read Neverwhere before digging into Anansi Brothers. The two books have different settings, but reside firmly within the realm of fantasy. The story is beguiling, especially in the beginning, but flags toward the end of the novel. I think the pacing is a tad slow toward the middle of the book, and some descriptions of characters feel repetative. However, Gaiman does masterfully tie together all the tails woven throughout the story in the end. Neverwhere is a better story, but Anansi Brothers isn't bad."
4,Mind blowing (but grim),Babel's writing is like no others. His stories are like viewing war through a flipbook.
3,A 'bit' better would have been nice,"""...you cast me as the mouse in your little cat drama""This series is slightly reminiscent of Monty Python, only not as (I hate to put is so bluntly) good. The problem mostly lies in the fact that many of these skits are parodies and reference pop culture and events - more like Saturday Night Live. So when watching something from that long ago - and from that far away - it wasn't nearly as enjoyable as if I'd been able to get all of the nuances. That's not to say that none of it was enjoyable (there certainly were moments that made me laugh) but it could have been better.I know, nothing tops the great Monty Python, so I should be disappointed. But, given how much I've enjoyed Stephen Fry on Whose Line is it Anyway? and Hugh Laurie as House, well, I was a bit let down. I'd say summing up this as a cross between Monty Python and Saturday Night Live, 20 years out of date, is the best description. Not a waste of time, but not the best use of time."
2,hard to watch,it seems to be bent toward heavy-dialog situation humor which felt too much like bickering and generated too few laughs. Even for British comedy - this is dry.
5,a Bit Of Fry and Laurie,"Having watched this when it first came out, it was great to take nostalgic trip back to enjoy these two great actors in their youth. I enjoyed all their shows together, particularly the ""Jeeves and Wooster series. They play off each other beautifully. I ordered this set to watch on my Kindle and have enjoyed many a late night laugh when insomnia struck.Highly recommend it."
4,Fast paced comedy sketches,"Being a Hugh Laurie fan, I wanted to see more of his 'beginings' with his co actor/friend. You can see their combined mastermind/brillant take on these scenerios which are very funny (however some of it was lost on me as an 'American')But there is no break after each vinette and after seeing 2 episodes I was exhausted from the break neck speed of transitioning from one bit to another. But I still recommend it highly - or should I say Hugh-ley!"
3,A bit of Fry & Laurie season 1,You need a chunk of time to view this. Not as humorous as I had hoped.
5,Great.,"I bought this with self adhereing pads and cork, and I really haven't used it, but it made a nice fix on some loose pads."
1,No help in sight,"The book doesn't paint a pretty picture if you want to raise your testosterone level. He sights quite a few studies that according to the author do nothing to raise your tes level. Other books on this subject find studies that do do things for your tes level and it seems this author IS talking about the same studies as the other books. His favorite saying about these studies is ""no conclusive proof"".Personally, I didn't read this book to basically have the only recommendation to do three types of workout and that will cure my problem. Fact is that I already do two types of his recommended workouts and really don't feel that adding the third will do that much.There is other much more positive reads out there."
5,Bobbi Brown concealer,Bobbi Brown Creamy ConcealerI am very pleased with this concealer. It goes on so smooth does not crease under the eye and covers what you want concealed. I would highly recommend to anyone. Sandy
1,review by Mark Schurr,"Boo, horrible book. Maybe I didn't like it because it did not tell me what I wanted to hear. Ceaser for example was a mass murder, rapist and an alcoholic which the book touches on, but reveres him as a great leader in human history which I find disgusting."
1,A complete bore!!,i was required to read this book for summer reading and i fell asleep 5 times trying to get through the first chapter. it is boring and pointless. i like books and can read about a page a minute or faster. i found myself taking five minutes to get through one page! i strongly dislike this book
4,Well-Done Review of Classical and Pre-Classical Rome,"In this book, Edith Hamilton focuses on the poets, playwrights, and other writers of Rome from approximately 250 BC to 150 AD. She chooses to do this because of the rarity of historical data for the earlier part of that period.I do not rate this book as highly as her The Greek Way, because she seems not to have the sympathy for Roman culture that she does for Greek culture. Also, she gives very little in the way of explanation as to how Greek culture became Roman culture, e.g., the transformation of the Greek gods into the Roman ones.Still, this is probably the best summary of the Roman culture of this period for the casual reader; Hamilton's prose is always lucid and energetic."
5,Urbanisation has had a profound impact...,"Urbanisation has had a profound impact on the church. Urban populations are growing at staggering rates. The vast majority of those living in large cities have not heard the gospel. Everyone ministering to the poor in the city will benefit from the cases and analyses presented in this, the fourth, of MARC's ""Serving with the Poor"" series."
3,Plan to buy a new one in a year or 2,"I have had this TV for a little over 2 years now. About 1 year ago the tapes stopped playing in the vcr part of the TV. It is becoming more and more of a problem to play vcr tapes. The tv ""eats"" the tapes. My friend had the same tv and has the same problems after the same amount of time. TV pictue is still great. Would not recommend buying this tv for the price."
5,Best CD in the Dance Mix USA Series,"I own every one of the Dance Mix USA collection and this snapshot of the dance music scene in 1996 is excellent. I've been lisening to this CD regularly since it was released and I never get tired of it. Rhythm of the Night, Tonight is the Night and Another Night are the SUPER TRACKS on this disk."
4,CD puts you in dance mode.,"This CD is great for parties or any event that requires high-energy music. The CD is a compilation of various music styles which provide a strong dance beat to get you moving. Of special note on the CD is ""All I Wanna Do"" by Joanne Farrell. I always liked the Sheryl Crow version, but this singer rocks it!"
5,Love It!!,"This is an awesome CD for those who enjoyed early ""back in tha day"" euro-dance. Here are my top 5 favs-Dreamer 1-Rhythm of the Night 2-Get ready 3-Moving on up 4-All I wanna do 5I recommend this CD to ANYONE!!"
3,different from original CD?,"I have the original CD Dance Mix USA 96, and the song list doesn't match up with this CD at all."
1,waste of money,"I was very impressed with the quality, this is a very well built unit, spreads very well and is very durable.I highly recommend it!The quick release pins are nice also for removing the spreader from your atv.============UPDATE=========the lever controlling the flow gate broke, the alligator clips do not stay on well, the spreader cloges very easily with even smooth fertilizer....Mine is going back"
4,"tastes great, but kinda small",I respect Health Valley's products for their healthy ingridents and skills to make their wholesome snacks taste good. These are small chocolate chip cookies.
4,Low fat cookies,Three cookies are only about 100 calories. These are tasty and very low in fat. They're a better deal than the over priced 100 calorie packs that they sell at supermarkets.
4,HP No. 11 Black Printhead,I could not get this product in the stores. I got it very fast through internet order. It works very well with my printer.
3,Yawn,"While being a huge fan of Acoustic Alchemy, I was a little disappointed at the small amount of performance footage. While the documentary style allows you understand the origins of this group, it overwhelms the magic of the band. Just when a song gets cooking they fade to interview. If you are looking for performance, don't waste your money. The documentary would be a nice addition though, if you are a collector."
3,Tribute or what,I am not sure if is a tribute to Nick Webb.... but I wanted a more serious DVD. Is a compilation of moments but in general there is no a complete song. it's a shame!
5,Caillou's Playschool Adventures,"This is 100% animated Caillou episodes. No more of those stupid puppet segments! Toddlers can pick up from life lessons based on how Caillou deals with everyday life. Family, friends & teacher guides Caillou on how to be a better person!"
3,"Caillou is great, but DVD NOT AS DESCRIBED: no French!","We love Caillou and have seen all the episodes on this DVD on PBS Sprout. My two year old son insists he is four, just so he can do all the things that Caillou does in his show. And, he has learned an amazing amount from how Rocket Ships fly to how to help out around the house.However BEWARE that the DVD is English only and not in English AND French as listed in the descriptions! I am VERY disappointed as we get Caillou with our TV subscription, so I ordered this DVD purely to be able to watch it in French. For example, we often play my son's Curious George DVD in French, to help him learn a second language. There is not a menu option for Language nor does it mention French being an option on the cover."
4,Not as described,"The product that I received from ordering this item does not match the description. There are no puppets on this disk, the description must be a generic one. My daughter did enjoy the episodes though."
4,Caillou's Playschool Adventures DVD,This DVD is great. No breaks in between each of the Caillou cartoons which is wonderful. My kids loved it.
5,My son loves this CD,This CD has paid for it self over and over. This is one of my son's favorite things to watch.
2,misleading description,"I purchased this video because I'm trying to teach my son French and trying to increase his exposure to the language. The description says the languages are English and French. Well, there is no French option, so for me, the dvd was a disappointment."
2,wrong description...,"i bought this DVD ONLY because french was listed as a language and it is not an option on the DVD.... so if you are buying this product because of the french option, DO NOT."
5,A brilliant black comedy,"Henry Farr is, to everyone else, a VERY boring man. But really, deep down he has a desire to murder his wife. It's not that he's a sadist or anything, he just can't think of any other way to prolong her absence indefinately.This is a brilliant and hilarious book. I loved it, and would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a light comedy. Nigel Williams has written a great story about middle aged man going through one of lifes crisis' - the book is easy to read, and really is impossible to put down."
5,These are so cool,My cousin has these and I was playing with them there so much fun and I never get bored of throwing them up and down. Now I need to buy some for myself. They rock.
5,Oidz are awesome!,These things are pretty sweet. The noises they make when you throw them are awesome! Buy them now!!
1,Danger- Do not buy,"Toys R us and clients beware!This toy can destroy CDs,VHS,monitors,cell phones and credit cards. Also is dangerous to people who have pacemakers!We read the very very small print on a very small enclosed book about the story of zoids only after our Sony flat TV started looking crazy and turning colors along the bottom. My husband and son finally moved the oidz away from the TV and thank heavens we hope there is no permanent damage! We would have no beef if there is damage because they have a disclaimer for the responsibility for the loss of data and property damage!!Wow what $10 could turn into! I e-mailed the company too and will return them and urge a larger warning sign or removal"
3,Yuma,"This movie has a good plot in it, and I've seen Clint Walker give a better performance in his early movies.It's worth watching and it will hold your enterest if you're a western fan like me."
2,Nice Try but no Cigar,"I was not able to translate the instructions into success in solving the cube. What confused me was the changing vocabularly.The graphics were good. If the author had consistantly used terms such as ' to move the corner pieces into place: do thisRi, Di, R, D it may have helped. So, I am still trying to solve this so that I can show off to my grandson. I haven't given up on the book yet,but today, it did not work for me."
2,Not much variation in arrangements,"Each song pretty much the same. Many of the same chords used in all songs. Was looking for a little more variation in style so that I could use the music as a background for a dinner party or social event. Was disappointed.Prompt service, well packaged, item in excellent condition."
1,this has got to be a joke....,"umm, i ordered this because i thought i would be a perfect hat to stuff my hair under... turns out it won't fit on the head of anyone! Trust me, I was upset it would not fit over even half my head so I made a point to have almost every one I know try it on....conclusion: the only person it would fit on without cutting off circulation was my buddies 2 month old baby!!! no joke.., but this hat certainly is... WTF???"
3,Good basic heart monitor,"This is a good basic monitor. It works with the bicycles at the gym, automatically displaying your heart rate on the bike. Often, though, the bike number displayed is one beat off of the number displayed on your watch (i.e. 120 bpm instead of 121). There are no fancy features with this monitor -- it just shows your bpm while exercising and that is all."
4,Updated Polar shows improvement,The new chest strap is lighter and more comfortable than my old hrm. Only complaint is the wrist strap buckle -- it could have been designed better.
2,Not for serious cyclists.,"I bought this because it had the range to mount on my trike. And in that sense it works where others didn't. But it has several serious shortcomings. It shuts itself off when no signal is received for about five minutes. e.g., when you come to a rest stop. And when you start it again all of the previous data is lost. Also it is seriously affected by power lines and just stops working. As I ride a recumbent I can't see the monitor if it is mounted on my wrist. This probably will work for you in the gym or for short rides, but don't buy it if you are a serious cyclist. Also, when I called Polar for some help the tech was quite rude to me."
3,they didn't send what I ordered,"Ordered black, which was not available in this color at my local sporting goods store-got blue, which I could have gotten in the store with no S&H; charge.Also somewhat disappointed in the monitor, which works fine for HR, but doesn't give a running time."
5,Polar Heart Rate Monitor,Recently got back into fitness (after a few years off) and the batteries still work! This is easy to use and syncs up to most fitness equipment.
4,Easy to use and simple,"This watch does exactly what most people need, and is incredibly easy to use.There are only a couple of things that keep me from giving it 5 stars, and that has more to do with me not thinking through everything I want:1. A backlight would have been handy.2. Minimum heart rate (in addition to max and average) is nice for resting heart rate measurements. (However, if you wait long enough, the average will approach the min.)3. Ability to store more than one session. I frequently do multiple cardio sessions while at the gym. It would be have a log of all of the cardio sessions I did that day.Overall, though, I'm very happy with it. It gets the job done."
5,Polar Monitor,"Takes a little getting used to, but once I understood the functions, it works great. Keeps me from exceeding HR objectives, both for me and my clients."
2,Disappointed,"Product was delivered as adveritsed, no problems. The dvd explains some steps, not the typical zumba, there is no actual workout....steps only. Very disappointed for 25.00, not worth the money."
4,Ener-G Chocolate Cookies,Not bad for wheat free cookies but could stand a touch more chocolatey flavoring.
1,Product not as described!,"When you look at the picture it looks like a full speaker is in there, but the speaker it comes with is actually smaller then what's pictured. I'm going to upload a picture of what I'm talking about."
2,Junk,"The 1 I bought was refurbished though. When I got the thing, & turned it on everything was in German. Luckily I know some German so I was able to set it to English, it lasted no time. (However, remember I purchased a refurbished one). I really like the way it looks though, very sleek."
2,sucks,"This product does not live up to the hype. It is slow, unresposive, and quite frankly, sucks. I would not buy this thing again if i was in desperate need. Your mom looks better than this thing and she is extremely ugly."
4,Tried it!,It works BUT you have to pair it with another shapewear product like the high waist brief or slimming brief. It has to tuck into another garment or it will roll up.If you do this it works and is a great camisole.not too hurt or uncomfortable.
2,Truly terrifying,"Before reading my comment, please bear in mind that I am a very uncensorious person who believes in giving children free range of reading matter; I was raised that way, raised my children that way, and want to see my grandchildren raised that way. However, I tried to imagine reading this beautifully illustrated (though syntactically very strange) book to any of my 2-8 year old grandchildren, and realized it would TERRIFY them. The spooky way it treats the separation of mothers and offspring, along with its implications that freedom is scary and potentially dangerous to warmblooded life, makes this a book I really don't want to have where my grandpeople can get hold of it while I'm babysitting them. They'd be screaming for their mother within minutes. This is the only book I've ever returned for a refund!"
5,Great recipes!,"Since beginning low-carb eating, I have found it difficult to find good dessert recipes that I could share with my family and friends. Nancy's cookbook has solved that problem for me. My Dad is a diabetic and now I can make desserts that even he can enjoy."
2,not what I expected,I was dissapointed in this book. She uses a lot of ingredients I am notfamiliar with and would not know where to purchase. I would not recommemdthis book.
1,"Should be called ""cook yourself fake with fake ingredients""","Maybe I'm too much of a food snob for this second rate version of baking. As a chef, I would not consider putting shake mix into any of my personal, or professional, baked goodies. Sugar fee jell-o brand pudding mix? Apparently the author didn't know that fat free, unsweetened cocoa powder existed. And I wouldn't touch Splenda with a 10 foot pole, let alone eat it. This book is a joke. I'm glad I only spent a penny for it. I'll stick with my real food, have a little less, and exercise a bit more."
1,Artificial cooking,Disappointing. No single recipe in this book is based on natural ingredients. And I am not talking about Splenda. Each recipe contains prefabricated shake or pudding mixes.
3,Times do change!,"This card was $450.00+ when they first came out, now they are a fraction of that. Still a good way to spiff up an older machine without having to spend a fortune. A word of caution, use the most recent drivers from ATI/AMD the ones on the CD-Rom are a bit unstable, otherwise the card works fine."
4,A stolid middle ground in the philosophy of science.,"I've always seen Kuhn as a middle ground between Popper and Feyerabend (Someone who took Kuhn's idea about society and personality influencing science, and ran with it) for the most part. I think Popper is a better writer, Feyerabend says more interesting and though provoking things, but if you want something approaching a synthesis of the falsifiability doctrine and the social dynamic way of looking at things, Kuhn, and this book by Kuhn is essential.This is where people who outgrow Gould and Dawkins should be coming. It's more dry, and less populist than these two, but it provides for a deeper understanding."
5,The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,"This book is a must read for every college freshman. It should be required for entrance to any technical or scientific discipline.Thomas Kuhn's seminal book on the evolution of knowledge and how new ideas are conceived, developed, and finally accepted. I had seen it referenced in many books and finally decided to read ir for myself.It is not an easy read but put in the effort and you will reap a great reward."
2,liked Greulich and Pyle much better,"This book has the advantage of being available for Kindle. However, this advantage was not enough to make me prefer it over Greulich and Pyle. In the Greulich and Pyle book, there is text with each bone age picture, telling you what to specifically hone in on to differentiate the ages from one another. I use that description to help me in a far number of cases. The Digital Atlas gave the ages in months too (e.g. 155 months) as compares to XX years XX months, which I did not like. I prefer Greulich and Pyle's standard deviation chart to this Digital Atlas's chart as well. I returned this book and will stick with Greulich and Pyle."
3,Bone Age Atlas,Es un buen resumen de imágenes digitales útiles para recordar las características principales de la anatomía radiológia de la maduración ósea en la mano desde el nacimiento a la adultez.
3,A LITTLE UNDERCOOKED,"THE STRONGEST PLUS FOR THIS FILM IS THE UNDERSTATED AND EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE FROM A YOUNG PETER SARSGAARD, A VERY COMPETENT ACTOR WHO ASSUMES COMPLEX CHARACTERS QUITE CONVINCINGLY. HIS CO-STAR, HOWEVER, KATHARINA WESSNIG ISN'T N HIS LEAGUE..A STRONGER ACTRESS IN THIS PIVOTAL ROLE MAY HAVE ELEVATED THE FILM'S EFFECTIVENESS. THE FILM HAS AN EERIE ATMOSPHERE, BUT ITS AMBIGUITY AND ENIGMATIC RESOLUTION LEFT ME WANTING SOMETHING MORE."
3,Large size smaller than usual,"I bought the large size for my husband and the gloves were almost too small. I think the sizes run smaller so if buying this product in the future, I would buy one size up."
2,not worth the money,"this gloves are not worth the money asked for them, 3 days and they are falling apart, and for the guy that can make this gloves last for more than a week, he must use them for typing on a keyboard from siberia, because for heavy work, they are useless, and another thing to consider, as another customer stated, this gloves run SMALL, i ordered the large size and they really run small, so if you still want to buy them do it, just order a size larger of what you usually use and you`ll be fine, just not for long..."
3,Decent,"The gloves are very comfortable. The only problem I have with this product, is that the stitching might have problem in long run. Would I recommend this product to a friend? I say I would."
3,Doesn't hold air well,"My daughter loves this ball, the only problem we have is we have to pump it up daily! She loves it enough that we sacrifice the few minutes to pump it up."
1,falls flat,Great concept. We bought it to help teach our 4 year old left-handed son (as we're both right-handers). But it only holds air for a few hours at a time. Total dud.
3,Harry Potter the Deathly Hallows part 2,"saw it at the movies an it was such a better movie than part one was that when it was offered I bought it! Duh? I don't remember what I was thinking? Indeed it was a ""better"" movie....but? The movie arrived as promised in good condition.....but I have to say, it took a lot out of me to finish watching the entire thing. definitely not recommended for the grandkids...an not a movie I would watch over an over again. So what was I thinking? Don't know but....not on my highly recommended list."
4,Series,"Hey, have and have read all the books, got to have the whole series as well. I know I will enjoy this series for a long time."
2,UltraViolet - No Thank you.,"This review is not for the film itself (which I love), but for the shoddy marketing tactic WB chose to employ with the digital release. Don't get sucked in to this. Buy the standard Blu-ray and don't bother with this. I buy 3-disc editions because I want to be able to have digital copies on my iPhone. This version is a complete and utter rip-off. You have to join their service and then download THEIR program to use it. REALLY unhappy with this one guys."
2,Do not buy this bluray if you want a true digital copy,You can not download the ultraviolet digital copy to your PC. It forces you to use the Flixster application to watch on your PC. You can not put the video on your Ipod without using a streaming app.
2,Movie Great - Ultra Violet Total Scam,I won't review the movie because we all know it was great. This Ultra Violet thing is a total scam. I tried for one hour to register and it just went in a loop. It is completely impossible to register (you actually have to create two accounts - one with UV and one with Flixster). I am convinced the whole thing is a scam to obtain marketing info on you and place tracking cookies on your computer. You actually can't register unless you consent to allow UV to share your info with all sorts of marketing entities. There is no way this UV thing will be in business 12 months from now. Just buy the movie and skip this UV nonsense. After all is said and done you will never register and never get the movie on your Ipod or Ipad so why pay for it as an option?
1,Do Not buy this digital copy!!!! Doesn't work with iTunes...a pain!,I will never buy another digital movie that runs on ultraviolet and that can't run on iTunes. Ultraviolet is a pain in the ass...not user friendly. Don't waste your money!
1,Streaming quality was horrible - movie good,I stream from other sites as well.. This stream was such poor quality. Movie is worth the watch. Streaming quality took so much away from movie.
5,Great service,"I placed my order back in Oct and was not expecting my oder until after the 18th of November. I got home yesterday Nov16 and there was my movie. Great Service as always, you can never go wrong when you order from Amazon."
4,Great,"Great story, The Harry Potter series movies have been more faithful to the books than any movie remake I have seen. sad its over"
1,Harry Potter 7 Part 2 - Do not buy if you want the digital copy,The Ultraviolet Digital Copy that comes with the move is horrible. It requires you to create 2 accounts (one on Ultraviolet/ one on flixster). Ultraviolet only provides streaming and flixster only lets you download to a device (will not download to itunes). My opinion is that everyone should boycott buying dvd/blue ray movies with Ultraviolet digital copies.
1,Wish I had read the other reviews on Ultraviolet - it stinks!,DO NOT BUY this set if you own any apple products. I thought I was getting a digital copy I could put on my kids ipods. No such luck. This is very deceptive and I won't buy this again. I will be trying to return this. You can only view it with a Flixster account and can't import it into ITunes.
1,Ultraviolet Flixter Crap is a Joke,I love the Harry Potter movie but this flixster ultraviolet crap made me give it only 1 star. Thanks for the itunes work around advice.
1,"Loved the Movie, hate the Ultraviolet Digital Copy","Loved the Movie Hate the Ultraviolet Digital Copy of the film.Ultraviolet Digital copies are not compatible in iTunes or even windows media devices.A customer is not always in an area that has an Internet connection to watch the streaming Digital copy.I travel over 200 days out of the year. Plains charge a service to use their Internet so now the copy is no longer free, as do Hotels, Airports and Train stations.The digital devices we purchase were designed to give us the freedom to take our entertainment with us not to be tethered to an Internet connection.Ultraviolet sucks for what I need it to do."
1,Great Movie but Ultra-Violet Digital Copy left me completely disgusted,"I harm a frequent buyer of dvd's that include Blu-Ray, DVD and digital copies. Having bought all sucks the Harry Potter with the digital copies for my 4 children to watch on their various electronic devices, I was thoroughly disappointed and at the end of the day disgusted with the Ultra-Violet digital copy included with the last Harry Potter movie -- so much that I just returned every planned Christmas gift that included the Ultra-violet copy (for example Smurfs and Cowboys vs Aliens). I will never spend another dime on any movie that contains the useless garbage marketed as ultra-violet digital. What a shame and what a scam!"
3,"BluRay great, but UV is horrid","I am adding my voice to the masses. People who are about to buy this product need to know what they are actually buying as I was duped by the words ""digital copy"". It was a lie. It is only a code to give you access to streaming content. I am glad to know that I can soon get a real digital version from the UK. It is ridiculous to not have the same access to a quality product as other people in the world."
2,"Good movie, but........","My only issue with this set is that the ""UltraViolet"" digital download is only usable through Flixster. You are not able to download it into itunes. If you are an itunes user and have all of your digital media in one place (like me), I would just buy the plain blu-ray version and download it from itunes if you need both a hard and digital copy."
2,One of the worst blu-ray disks I ever watched,"I was excited to get the Blu-ray disk so quickly from Amazon. But the image quality is awful. It's not bright enough, not sharp, the details on faces are often lost, and the colors are faded. It's worse than lot of ordinary DVDs I own. Very disappointed. Really a disservice to a great movie."
1,BLU-RAY HAS AUDIO OUT OF SYNC - UltraViolet Digital Copy NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ITUNES - not really a digital copy,"Don't waste your money on this ultraviolet STREAMING ""digital copy"". It does not create a copy on your pc, apparently it just streams. Plus, you will have to create an account on ""Flixter"" - yet another site that wants to require you to keep your digital movies on the cloud.Another attempt to keep folks from OWNING and possessing digital content. I will nevr purchase a digital copy in this manner again.I hope this review prevents others from making my mistake and saves some time and money.UPDATE - The Blu-Ray audio does not sync with the picture. Had to stop and reload 3 times during the movie to try to get the thing to run. This appears to be a terrible transfer of the Blu-Ray. If I didn't buy it from Amazon, I would swear the whole thing is a pirated copy."
2,Not impressed with Ultraviolet/Flixster,"First off let me say that I loved this movie! I have the digital versions of Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows pt1 that I love to watch on my computer and iPod, and was looking forward to getting the digital copy of DH pt2 as well. Unfortunately for some reason, someone at WB decided to go with Ultraviolet/flixster for the digital release this time around. Too bad. I tried Ultraviolet/Flixster with my digital version of The Green Lantern and after going through the whole sign up install was unimpressed to say the least! I want to watch a movie (That I paid for) on my computer, NOT have some sort of social experience! Sorry WB, but I'll hold on to my money for another time. :("
1,Do not buy for digital copy,"The movie is great. I gave this one star because of the digital copy. This is some new streaming digital copy and it is not compatible with iTunes or really anything else. You will always need to be connected to the web to view the digital copy so it will count against your band width cap. Read about UltraViolet before you spend the extra money, there is a single disk version. Save some money or at least know what you are buying."
1,One Star for UltraViolet Streaming!!!,"I agree with everyone, this ""SO-CALLED"" digital copy on ultraviolet is a joke! I will not buy any movie that comes with it... Warner Bros. needs to get it together and go back to a real digital copy! until then, I will buy these movies directly from iTunes and play it on my apple TV."
3,Missing item,The Movie arrived but the UltraViolet Digital Copy was missing. The disk said that to receive it I would have to purchase it as this had been a rental copy.
2,The digital worked,But the actual DVD skipped multiple times and some parts of the movie had audio that did that not match the picture. Very bad. Very disappointed. Two stars because I was able to watch the film on digital.
2,Description isn't correct,"Ordered this wanting the BluRay/DVD combination, but disc that arrived was BluRay only disc. Apparently the graphic but NOT the description is accurate..."
1,"Ultra-Violet: horrible, awful, do not buy!","I will not support Ultra-violet! Great movie, LOUSY ""digital"" copy. Clearly, the movie companies do not care about what we want. We need to make them care by not buying into this awful, new format."
3,ultraviolet digital copy sucks,tried to download digital copy and kept getting error messages from yahoo apparently need their flash player as well couldn't test to see if it will load into itunes and ipad
1,Stay away from UltraViolet Digital Copy,"The point of buying the movie with a digital copy is so I can take the movie with my on my iPad and iPhone on a business trip and watch while on a plane or train, or at a hotel with the typical miserable Wifi connection. This UltraViolet Digital Copy / Flixster crap does not allow me to do that, so it's useless, don't buy."
1,5 Star Movie in a 1 star package thanks to Ultraviolet,"This movie is a fantastic show, and was a great finish to the Harry Potter series. However, I cannot, and will not support or purchase any movie that comes with an Ultraviolet digital copy. I purchased Green Lantern and was surprised that I got a worthless streaming digital copy. I live in an area where I don't even have 3g coverage, so I cannot stream my movie at all. Then I got locked out of my copy by Ultraviolet and despite emailing both Ultraviolet and Flikster, I still cannot access my digital copy. I WILL NOT be purchasing another movie that comes with an Ultraviolet digital copy. The movie execs are driving my business away. Now I am looking at buying an Apple TV and just buying digital copies from ITunes. The minute this is fixed, I will continue my purchasing of Blu-Rays that come with an actual digital copy."
1,Avoid Ultraviolet Digital Copy version!!!,"If you want a digital copy that can download through iTunes, play on an iPad, or even effectively stream, do not buy the Ultraviolet version. Just check the 1 star reviews of Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern. I had purchased the Green Lantern and was unable to get my digital copy. This is after creating accounts on Flixster and Ultraviolet, then following all the other steps. All I received was an error message and no way to resolve the problem. When I contacted Ultraviolet, I was told it was a Flixster problem. Customer service doesn't seem to exist at Flixster since I haven't received any response to date other than check the FAQ. Since experiencing this horrible service, I have canceled any upcoming Ultraviolet releases from my orders and will only buy from either iTunes or the single DVD version. Please save yourself unnecessary frustration and don't buy this version."
5,The Saga Ends,I dreamt about a scene in this movie (Harry's body being carried back to the school). The movie outdid my dream.And the 3D effects are not intrusive in home video (Epson Pro-Cinema 6010)- and I thought the 3D in the theater WAS intrusive.Very satisfying conclusion to the series.Except for that one scene...(fill in YOUR favorite scene to hate) this has been a wonderful collection of filmsThank you everyone!
1,Movie skipped,"When I got the movie in the mail I thought it was new because it had a clear wrap over it, but when I played it for the first time last night in the DVD player for the second half of the movie it was skipping. The second half probably took 10 minutes. I am very upset, that I had paid for it and got this result. When I took the disc out to clean it, there are deep scuffs right in the inner ring, where the movie plays.I love harry potter, and this movie is great for the final ending BUT this product was scratched, and I would not buy from this company again. I bought this product on the 25th, so shipping was acceptably, but not the fastest"
4,Nice way to wrap the series,I grew up with this movies and it was bitter sweet ending to the series. I agree with the other reviewers to stay away from the Ultraviolet but the movie itself is great!
1,"Great movie... but UV ""digital copy"" won't work on iPads, iPhones","Loved the movie, and wanted disc and digital copies for viewing on TV as well as on portable devices. Astounded to find out that the so-called UltravViolet ""digital copy"" doesn't work on iPad or iPhone."
3,Overall disappointment but visually stunning,"As a hardcore Harry Potter fan I was really disappointed in this final installment in the movie series. Strangely enough, as I was reading the second half of the book when it first came out I thought it would be the easiest to translate to film. Boy was I wrong. the story feels rushed, pushed in the background of big visuals and unneeded random bits of 3D. Harry Potter was never a story about flashes and bangs but a story about a boy finding his place. That was lost in this film. If you like to watch movies to see things get blown up then this is the movie for you! If you like to watch movies for rich storytelling, then you'd probably be better off reading the book. I gave this movie three stars because while the story was lacking in comparison to the book, the visuals, when not in the god awful 3D were stunning. Also the Princes Tale was very well done."
1,Digital Copy Rip-Off,"Just had my first experience with WB/Flixster/Ultraviolet digital copy experience with Green Lantern. Had per-ordered this version of Deathly Hollows part 2, and cancelled when introduced to this WB consumer scam. If you want to add this to your iTunes library, forget this version. I cancelled and ordered the Blue Ray movie only version."
4,screen size,I loved the movie but I wish I could have bought it in full screen. I don't like wide screen because sometimes it cuts off the heads.
5,Excellent movie,For me this is the best movie of the entire sequel and obviously the possibility of watching it in a 3-D format increases the entire experience.
1,"""Digital Copy"" Scam","As far as the movie is concerned I love it. The digital copy is not a digital copy at all. You still have to stream it to any device you want to watch it from. Ultra violet is a complete rip off. If I'm on a plane, in airplane mode on my iPhone, I can't stream it to my phone because there is no signal. This is a shame, Ultra Violet does not need to be recognized as a digital copy of a movie. So disappointed."
1,"Ultraviolet ""Digital Copy""? What a Ripoff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is not a review of the movie, which is great. This is not even a review of the BD, which is great.This is a review of the false bill of goods WB sold me under the guise of a ""digital copy.""Don't belive the name, folks. This isn't a digital copy as you've come to know it. It's a crap way to try and sell their new digital model and to break people away from iTunes or Amazon Unbox. It's crap, it's garbage, and it's not compatible with any of my digital devices (iPod, iPad, even my BD player). Crap, crap, crap!If Warner Bros. offers everyone who bought this on the promise of a true digital copy an actual TRUE digital copy that I can put on MY devices, I will rate this higher. As it stands, I will never pay extra for an ""Ultraviolet"" copy ever, ever again."
1,JUST SAY NO TO FLIXSTER/ULTRAVIOLET,"I pre-ordered this movie because WB is going to put HP movies in the ""vault"" come end of December. What I did not know, and now am thankful to all the other negative reviewers, is that you have to have an account to download this. I purchased thinking I would be able to use it on my iPad for my daughter (who loves HP) when we go on long car drives (which is frequently). Nope. I will be making sure that everyone on my Facebook account knows that this is a third-party application that must be downloaded onto your computer and can control other content. What an awful deception in advertising by this company, and WB. Shame on you."
1,Digital copy won't work with iTunes,"When I ordered this I expected the digital copy to work on itunes as all my movies are streamed to my apple tv, this strange copy doesn't work at all and is useless for my needs."
1,DIGITAL COPY IS A SCAM,THE MOVIE COVER STATES THERE IS A DIGITAL DOWNLOAD. BUYER BEWARE. This does not download to iTunes. You have to create some account and it won't transfer over. Completely worthless.
1,Not iTunes digital copy.,"When I preordered this several weeks ago the digital copy was advertised as iTunes, wished I had made screen shots. I do not want Ultraviolet streaming copy free for three years and then maybe I can keep it by subscribing or something. I want a true digital copy. I would never have paid for this without an iTunes digital copy!"
1,Ultra Violet = Ultra Yuck,"Awesome movie, bad idea. I travel - I like to watch movies on my iPad on the plane. Ultra Violet is not cutting it. Also, we have many Apple TV's in the house that are great to watch movies on. Not happening with the Ultra Violet copy.Here is the link to the REGION FREE version on the UK Site with a TRUE DIGITAL COPY: [[...]]As of now, it converts to just under $22.00. Won't get here until 2nd week in December, but that's fine with me!"
1,Filxster and Ultraviolet are BAD for business,"Filxster and Ultraviolet are BAD for business!!What a horrible idea, trying to force consumers to view a Digital Copy on a website and stream it, rather than having a real Digital ""COPY."" A copy is that, a ""Copy,"" not Streaming ""Access."" I will NEVER buy an Ultraviolet Digital ""Copy"" ever again!"
3,"DVD good, ultraviolet not","While I was never able to get the ultraviolet digital copy thing to work (it keeps locking between flixter and ultraviolet in registration), I was able to watch the dvd itself and was perfectly happy doing just that."
1,The digital copy is worthless,"The Ultraviolet digital copy is worthless. Every other digital copy you download into your iTunes or media player to view it on your TV, computer or portable device. Ultraviolet is a streaming service so you really don't own a digital copy.It should not be advertised as a digital copy only as access to a online stream. The movie itself is great."
1,"Great Movie, worthless ""Digital Copy""","While the movie itself is great, the ultraviolet digital copy is completely worthless. You can't download it to your tablet to take on a plane, you have to be connected to WiFi and stream it. Not only that but I jumped through all the hoops to get the copy to stream on my Android Tablet, install the app, create a flixster account, create an ultraviolet account, enter the code, etc .... and after all of that it fails to stream on my tablet, worthless.If you are buying this movie in hopes of a real digital copy then don't buy this, it's not worth it."
1,Ultraviolet - Just don't. Ever. For any reason,"I got this with the Ultraviolet copy, hoping to be able to watch on my Mac and iPad, but cannot even register. I get confusing ""forbidden"" dialogs when trying to register, sometimes they say ""invalid password"" (with any kinds of passwords: short, long, U/L, numbers, symbols, etc).Then I go online and see that nobody's really happy with ""Ultraviolet"". That outta teach me to look up reviews of new technology before I buy it. The BluRay works fine. But I have no idea how Ultraviolet will work, since I can't even register for an account!!!!Steve"
1,One unhappy customer!!!,"The movie is great, but the ""digital download"" is crap! I will never purchase multi-format DVD's from Warner Bros again! This is very misleading and a complete waste of my hard earned money!!!"
1,Avoid Ultraviolet digital copy,The ultraviolet digital copy required me to download Flixster onto my ipad2. I would rather just download from Itunes and buy the Blu-Ray without the digital copy.
1,Don't buy if you want a downloadable copy!,"I bought this in advance of the release just because of the downloadable copy, but when it finally got here I found out that it is not really a downloadable copy at all! This is total misadvertizing and I want my money back, but because it is already opened, I cannot. What a shame. Amazon should do something to compensate!"
1,"Beware, you are about to be ripped off","Beware the ""digital copy"" is not a downloadable copy of your own, but a link to a website IF you sign up and share email and personal information.Based on the site reviews it looks like the ""digital copy"" can not be accessed without internet access.I passed on signing up and will look for and AVOID the Ultraviolet scam on any future movie purchases.Too bad I did not discover what the UltraViolet ""digital copy"" was until after I opened the package and thus can no longer return.I got ripped off.BEWAREBEWAREBEWARE"
1,ULTRAVIOLET IS TERRIBLE - DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"Wish I could give this product ZERO stars. I love and own all of the Harry Potter movies. DO NOT BUY this version. Ultraviolet Digital Copy is not a true digital copy - it is just a rented streaming copy that expires in 3 years. You cannot save this copy on your computer or hard drive and it is not viewable on any iPad or iPhone unless you use the Flixster app to stream it (i.e. you must have an internet connection to watch it). You must also create Ultraviolet and Flixster accounts to use this copy and download their software to view the rented copy. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY. Warner Brothers seems oblivious to the fact that this new service means piracy will only increase.Provide a true digital copy and I will buy it. I got duped on this one, but won't ever buy an Ultraviolet Digital Copy again."
4,The final chapter!,"Okay, I love this film and had obviously seen it before - one thing I will say that I really DID NOT love about it was the fact that on the spine of the DVD, it does not have Harry's picture and ""year 7 part 2"" at the top of the spine as the rest of the films do. It really ruins the ambiance and feel of the collection when they're all displayed together. The film however, is magnificent!"
5,Movie,This movie was purchased for a friend who truly loves it. The movie was a good deal and arrived in perfect condition.
3,Good movie,Liked all the Harry Potter movies but thought that some were better then others. Overall I think they were good movies. Loved watching them all grow up from movie to movie.
3,"Movie is great, extras not so much","I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series and now that they're all available in Blu-Ray I'll probably get the whole series. It's fund to watch them develop over the years and the final one really put a nice cap on the series.That said, I'm not really crazy about the Ultra-violet digital copy. In fact, the whole UV format should be re-examined. I probably will not spend the money for the extra digital copy of the movie if it's going to be UV. Won't load onto my iPod which I use frequently while traveling. I can't see any advantage to using UV over a more iPod friendly format or even WMV, for which I already have a viewer and don't need to download any additional software for. I simply won't pay for UV anymore."
2,Worse than expected,"I own the previous 7 movies on bluray, so I have something to compare with.The image jumped at least 5 times while I was watching the movie.I can not download my digital copy because I live outside the USA, if I knew, I would have bouhgt the bluray only set. There should have been a caveat."
1,Trick the Customer,"I ordered a new DVD but Amazon sent me an used one.The DVD case was re-wrapped with the plastic but it was different wrapping style than original one, and there was no white sticker on top of the case which every DVD has. The paper case had two big scratch marks and a big dent.I've been a Amazon customer for a long long time but I don't think I can trust Amazon anymore."
4,a good end to the series,I really liked this final movie in the harry potter series. It was very action packed and the ending tied everything up in a nice shiny bow. Definitely a good movie
4,"Great movie, but digital copy a hassle.","Movie arrived on time. My only complaint about this set is the digital movie is Ultra Violet, and you have to join another online site with another user name and password to access the digital copy. Too frustrating and not worth the effort. I miss being able to download the digital copy by entering a code, and then the digital copy is yours without having to access another member website."
4,It's over,"At least it's over, I did like the ending even though it was a bit lazy and felt a bit rushed. It's worth the money so I say buy are rent it, but get both one and two at the same time. And to add a little bit of a spoiller, the ending was a bit weak for such a well backed movie."
5,LOVE THAT HARRY,If you are a fan of wizards & wizardry and have read and or seen the Harry Potter books and movies...this is the movie that brings it ALL TOGETHER.....
4,Good movie,"Everyone by now knows the plot, the characters and I am not going to even entertain the idea of providing another dull nothing saying naration of the movie. I liked the movie, the theme is known.. have fun watching it at home in Blue Ray, it is defintely better then the DVD version."
5,Great Ending to A Pleasing Series,"I really did enjoy these movies. After being very skeptical, my boyfriend talked me into watching them with him and I truly like them. This was a great finale!"
5,"H.P. and the Deathly Hallows, Pt.2","Bought this to complete our set. Couldn't beat the price so it was a no-brainer. It arrived very quickly, in plenty of time for Christmas. Great movie, now we'll have to check out the special features..."
4,"Great movie, have no need for digital UV copy","5 stars for the quality of the content, 3 stars for not needing the UV copy, 4 stars for getting this on lightning deal = 4 stars overall."
1,A very contemporary film... in the worst possible sense,"Around the time that games started making more money than films, movies began to look an awful lot like games and the last few Harry Potter films are no exception. Every scene has the same texture, dim lighting, awkward and indecipherable action sequences created by people who have likely spent far too much time indoors to know how things actually look and move.Not to be outdone, David Yates method directs like a binging Death Eater and drains any remaining signs of life from this once charming series. The main characters all but collapse under the weight of their faux grim and gritty makeovers. Cringe-worthy lines like, ""Not my daughter you b***h!"" pretty much ensure that this film will only be timeless as an object of ridicule, much like an avocado-colored refrigerator is today."
2,3D to 2D processing is ackward,"I greatly enjoyed this movie in theaters as a 3D viewing.Like most people, I don't own a 3D TV and don't intend on purchasing one. I find the idea of sitting in my living room wearing sunglasses to watch TV to be very strange.That said, I was very disappointed in watching this movie at home as a bluRay 2D movie. It is very apparent that it was filmed for 3D and a lot of effort was spent on 3D gimmicks. While this worked in the theaters, I found that it greatly decreases the watchability of the film once you have it at home. Not at all on par with the first 7 movies in this regard and a sad bookend to my HP bluRay collection."
1,Ultraviolet is ultra useless,"As has already been mentioned, Ultraviolet is NOT a digital copy but rather a license to stream. But if you are like me (or more precisely, like my kids) then the time and place of greatest need for a digital copy is on their iPad during a long car or plane trip, precisely the times when it is impossible to stream! Ultraviolet therefore fails the most basic test: is it useful when and where people need it the most. It is most assuredly not."
1,Ultraviolet = Ultra-annoying!!!!!!!!,"Great movie, great blu-ray, great dvd...BUT,Ultraviolet Digital Copy is not the same thing as other standard digital copies.It will not sync with iTunes, and you have to stream or download it through another app you have to download first.Very annoying.I had to create 2 separate accounts (ultraviolet & flixster) to get to my ""digital copy"" and had to avoid syncing these accounts with my facebook profile 3 times!I just want the digital copy to be in the same library as my other digital copies, not have them in several services scattered throughout my iPhone."
1,Ultraviolet copy is a scam!!! Not iTunes compatible,"Yep I was dooped by the Ultraviolet copy. Excuse me for believing that ""Copy"" really meant a copy of the movie on my computer. If you were planning on putting it in your iTunes collection don't bother with this crap, it won't work."
1,NO DIGITAL COPY,"Was very disappointed to find that I could not download a digital copy (which I paid for!) to use as I wanted. Instead we're stuck with this streaming thing that forces you to use their software to view the movie. I sent a complaint already to the company but they were unsympathetic. I would strongly suggest those of you who want to buy the blu ray, just buy that. Don't spend extra for a ""digital copy""...it's a complete scam and ripoff. I will return mine and purchase a digital copy thru ITunes."
1,Another Ultraviolet Piece of Junk,ANother loss of a sale. Will not buy any ultraviolet copies. Do not work. Bring back the Itunes campatible digital copies.
1,Love the Movie. HATE ULTRAVIOLET!,off course we all know the last Harry Potter was great. The only thing that disappointed me was Ultraviolet digital copy. i was looking forward to watching this on Itunes or from my ipod but sorry! Ultraviolet just lets u watch it from their stupid a$$ website. it is terrible. so for anyone buying this just for the digital copy i would stay away from this.
1,Digital copy only works with Flickster,"I am really upset that I paid extra for the digital copy and can only watch it with Flickster! I will not buy another anything that offers a ""Ultra Violet Digital Copy"" again. What a hassle! BOO!"
1,Digital Copy is a rip off,They may as well not say that there is a digital copy.1. You don't get a copy.2. You have to install an app and create two different accounts on some random website.3. Even then it only streams.Serious ripoff.
1,"Movie = 5 Stars, UV = 1 star","I bought this movie to get the 2nd part on Digital Copy also, to only get slapped in the face to not be able to add to my ITunes Library. Anyone have any SOLID solution on how to try and trade this worthless UV code for an ITune code?"
1,The movie is fantastic; Ultraviolet is not.,Whoever had the bright idea to use the Ultraviolet format for a so-called digital copy should be fired. Consumers expect a digital copy that can be used on their various mobile devices. It is a travesty for those of us who purchased this particular version in order to be able to play on our iPads or other tablets to be stuck with a joke like Flixter. Amazon should stand behind its customers and demand that the studio provide a real digital copy free to anyone who purchased this.
3,Very fun movie- ultraviolet Digitial is terrible though,"If you're considering this movie then you probably don't need a movie review from me. You've no doubt seen the other films and seen this already in the theatre. This is a god movie and sounds and looks great on bluray. I give the product 3 stars because the included ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy"" (UVD) is total junk. The UVD is not like a typical ""digital copy"" (DC), in that you cannot download the movie and store a low-resolution copy in your itunes (or other media manager). Instead of functioning like a typical DC, you need to log onto the net and you can then stream a copy of a the movie (not download) over an active internet connection. The UVD plays back in its own player and looks and sounds poor.If you need just a copy of the Bluray then you propably won't mind about the terrible UVD. I was dissapointed however and will steer clear of anything offering UVD."
1,Movie is great - the digital copy is a RIPOFF,"DONT BUY THIS FOR THE DIGITAL COPY - wish I could give this ZERO stars.I agree with all posters who gave this RIPOFF DVD release a one star rating. What good is a digital copy that you cannot watch through iTunes or put on your iPad, iPod Touch or iPhone? What was Warner Brothers thinking with this? Their packaging does not specify you cannot watch the movies directly from iTunes LIKE ALL THE OTHER PRIOR RELEASED HARRY POTTER MOVIES.From now on - I buy directly from iTunes, purchase the Apple TV and stream from my device to my TV. No more need to pay for the RIPOFF DVD with a RIPOFF digital copy.The Harry Potter movie itself is outstanding - the RIPOFF Warner Brothers Flixster with UltraViolet is USELESS for those of us with iPads or any other Apple device.NO TRUST with Warners anymore. I hope the studio goes UNDER. Were they taking advice from NetFlix executives?"
1,Ultraviolet is a TERRIBLE!!!,"I have to say I was very disappointed when I was expecting to load HP 7 Part 2 onto my iPad for my trip tomorrow. No can do without a download of some other app! WHAT?!?! Ok, I'll watch it on my AppleTV tonight....NOPE! CAN'T do that either. Ok, then on my computer.....not without install some custom software! SERIOUSLY!!! Talk about a POOR decision to go with this terrible product called ULTRAVIOLET! They should have stuck with what worked, normal iTunes redemption. I fell cheated and I certainly didn't get what I paid for! My copy of HP 7 Part 1 has this garbage too, now I payed for 2 movies that I won't get to use!!!"
1,Ultraviolet Digital is Crap,DO NOT buy Ultraviloet Digital if you have an Apple Mac Computer. It DOES NOT work with them and Amazon DOES NOT tell you this. I have bought two movies with the Ultraviolet version on them and just now discovered that they don't work on my computer. I have been screwing around with this crap for several days only to learn today that it will not work. The original description didn't even say it was Ultraviolet Digital before I bought this movie. I also bought Green Lantern and it had Ultraviolet on it too.
1,Ultraviolet = Terrible,"Why can't Warner Brothers just give you a download code for iTunes like every other studio? UltraViolet is HORRIBLE. Stay away! I may never buy another WB movie again. That said, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is a great movie. I just feel like I was duped with this purchase because of the type of digital copy (UltraViolet)."
1,Incompatible Format,"I play my Blu-rays in a computer drive using Cyberlink software. When I insert this disk, I get the message fhat the disk is an unsupported format. It is a hybrid format that includes both a game and the movie. So I can't play just the movie portion of this disk.I suppose I can upgrade my version of Cyberlink software for $$$, but I think I'll save my money for a new consumer Blu-ray player. In the meantime, I can't play this disk. Buyer beware."
3,Kinda Draggy,I have read the books and was just as disappointed in the movie as I was the final book. It was very sudden and wow the jump. Hmmmmmm I had to see it but wish I had rented it instead of buying.
2,Ultraviolet = ultracrap!,"Brought this movie as a christmas gift, loved the idea of digital copy. I didnt know that you had to do all this nonesense just to watch the dvd on anything else but a dvd/blu ray player. Ultraviolet is crap, i thought it would make the movie more enhanced but instead it made me not want to watch it at all! The movie is great, enjoyed it with my family. I just wish I could have watched it on my I touch without needing wifi or any of this other stuff. In my opinion, this is not worth the money!"
3,Great ending,"The Screenwriter and Director did a great job with the last of the series. As for the DVD, I was disappointed. Ultraviolet is NOT a digital copy included in the package that can be played on a device of your choice. It is a website you have to sign up for to access it."
5,Harry Potter Deathly Hallows 2,"Love this movie. My daughter and I have watched the whole series together, no9to nice, but twice. They are favorites!"
5,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2",Bought this for requested Christmas gift for daughter as she is a big Harry Potter fanShe enjoyed them very much
5,What's not to like about the Harry Potter series!,Our whole family enjoys the complete series whether in print or on the screen. The fantasy is fun; the conflict between good and evil is the heart of great literature; the characters are real even though imaginary. I've always like that Harry needs others. He is not the super-hero who can do things by himself. The author has woven her amazing intellect and knowledge into an excellent series to be enjoyed by all ages and all readers - even those wo rarely read a book (e.g. like a friend of our son).
5,movie,what can you say great movie and verry happy it realy made my harry potter colection compleat if you like harry potter this is a must
5,THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME,"I love all the harry potter movies, i bought this dvd on black friday for cheap! Great buy, love it."
5,shipped fast,the movie was here quicker than expected. it is a really great movie and i would recommend to any one.
1,a harry potter episode for distrubed teenagers on crack,"Why did I waste my time and money on this crap! Needlessly dark and lacking in anything uplifting, inspiring or thought provoking."
3,Just another movie.,"it was hard to find the link to this movie. everyone searches for part one.like i said, this is just another sequel for fans. while i sat through the first part, i was quite bored. but the action in the second half of the movie hooked me, so this movie might actually be decent. but not good. im not much of a movie fan. more of a book fan."
2,"Deathly Hollows, 1 and 2","It seems the more complicated the story became, the simpler the movie version. So much of the detail was left out of these movies, they weren't worth watching."
2,Why not set Parts 1 & 2 together?,"It is strange that up till now, a set that packages both parts together.I didn't want to by one story in two purchases"
2,Avoid if you're using a Samsung player.,"On both my Samsung players (BD-P1500, BD-C5500), this disc's audio playback stutters noticeably at several points in the film, mostly at or near climaxes in the action. It's very distracting. I bought a LG Blu-Ray player, and it plays them correctly, so this is compatibility problem, but it's one that Samsung should have addressed a year ago, as the same problem also affects part 1.WB has been unresponsive to inquiries about the problem. I'm not sure if the discs are out-of-spec in terms of peak bandwidth, or what, but the two Deathly Hallows discs are the only Blu-Ray discs that have misbehaved on either player."
4,Great movie,"Great flick, blu-ray looked great. For those whining about the Ultraviolet, you can go to the website and DOWNLOAD a copy to put on what ever device you want up to 5 time per movie. I hate digital copies period anyway"
1,Not worth the time to watch,It was boring. The plot was trivial and there were no really fun or interesting scenes in the movie. Thre were no peical effects or fun to watch scenes.
5,Great finale to this series,"With a long tradition of movie series being progressively--worse! as the series progresses, why should I think otherwise? Wrong! The last of this stellar series was a satisfying conclusion to the Rowling masterpiece."
1,Movie is alright but ultraviolet is another word for screw the customer,"In order to get your UV copy, you have to do the following...1) Sign up for a flixster account2) Sign up for an ultraviolet account3) Download Flixster Collections program to your computer4) Attempt to download digital copy and get stuck when Flixster Collections freezes.5) Contact customer support and argue with them until they give you an alternative way of getting your digital copy as they try to get you to repeat steps 1-4.Right now I'm still stuck on step 5.I would never buy another movie that has ultraviolet digity copy. Their motto is screw the paying customer cause this has no effect on the people that actually steal the movie."
1,Ultra Violet Sucks,"Ive got nothing against Harry Potter but by having Ultra Violet for the Digital Copy, the experience gets worst. Ive no problem having a digital copy via iTunes. But for this, WTF?! I pay extra so I can play at home and on the road. But this just wrong. Forcing this way to get the digital copy is just plain wrong."
3,A good end to the series which could have been better.,"After getting suckered into watching the first movie years ago. This movie ends the series. It is a good adaptation of the book and like most adaptations it would have been done better in some area's. The movie though does explain a few details better than the book did and that was the author's intent when she reviewed the script that had been written. In the end however I still think more could have been done. The part of Harry's death reeks of religious belief and is done in the movie much like the 'Passion of the Christ' to give Harry the 'Chirst' appeal by the death and rebirth. Even though I don't think it was needed. It gets old that more and more movies are putting this into their plots and story lines. Well, in 15 years they'll do a 'remake' of it as they did with 'Total Recall' and others. Maybe it will be better."
5,Loved the Harry Potter movie,I loved watching the movie on the big screen and hadn't been able to purchase a copy yet. I was glad to be able to purchase one at such a great price.
5,"Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part 2","I have read all of the books and own all the movies. these movies are really good. they as usual differ from the books some, but I still enjoy them very much. They did a great job on this movie and I enjoyed it thouroughly."
3,Ultraviolet Digital Copy is a Rip Off!!!,"I ordered this set because I wanted the Digital Copy of the movie so I could put it on my iPad and watch it when I travel. I was extremly disapointed to discover that the ""Digital Cp[y"" included in this set is an Ultraviolet Digital Copy and can only be streamed. I was able to download it to my computer, but I can't import it into iTunes. WHAT A RIP OFF!!! I wish they had made this more clear and I would have saved the money. Epic fail for Flixster and Ultraviloet."
5,"I'm not reviewing the ultraviolet copy, just the film","This was the greatest film ever! At first when I saw the part one of deathly hallows, I didn't see how they were possibly going to top it, but they did. This movie was well done, well acted and all around five stars. Also, I did not think I was ever going to like another harry potter movie as much as Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of fire, but this one was great. I hope people don't think i'm strange for liking those three the most, because I loved them! My only beef with Goblet of fire was that it should have been a two parter. I felt that the last four books of this series should have been two parters like the 7th one. Call me a hopeless harry potter geek, but if that were the case, and the last four were two parters, (as opposed to just the last one) then the harry potter movies would still be in theaters, and I kind of miss that they are over."
1,"Terrible product, even if it's a good movie","I bought this largely for the digital copy. Unfortunately, the UltraViolet digital copy is not the sort of digital copy that has come with other movies I've purchased. It is extremely restrictive and an absolute pain to use. The description of what you get in the digital copy is misleading, and the final product is horrible. Such a shame, as the movie itself is very good. Stay away from the UltraViolet digital copies."
1,disc doesn't work,"Movie arrived ahead of schedule, and case and packaging are wonderful, unfortunately the dvd doesn't work in any of our dvd players. And I don't have a printer or access to one to return it, very disappointed. :("
2,Great Movie - Ultraviolet Awful,"Great movie, if you are buying this you probably already know its a quality film. That said, the Digital Copy is garbage. You will be forced to download a proprietary software program in order to watch the film. WILL NOT work with iTunes or any other player. This was a really bad idea."
2,Why did they package it this way?,"Why did they package it this way? A combo of Blue-ray and one ""regular"" DVD...with the Special Features Only on a Blue-ray disc? Why couldn't they have just sold a 2-disc version in ""regular"" DVD, with the movie on one disc and the Special Features on the second disc, like they used to?! If you cannot play Blue-ray there is no way for you to see the Special Features...that is such a disappointment for me, and I am sure, for others.Pleeaassse...to whomever is in charge...please put out a 2-disc ""regular"" DVD version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 1 and then part 2.OR...could you please put out a 3-disc (or 4-disc) combination package of Both parts, Together, with the Special Features combined onto one disc (or 2 extra discs if necessary), in ""Regular"" DVD. Please, oh, please!!!"
1,Digital copy is a laught,"Many folks have raised the issue, but this isn't your typical digital copy of a movie. You can't download it to your computer and use it on an iPad or phone. You have to sign up for an account and install their software just to download and play the movie.My problem was that I pre-ordered this movie a couple of months ago. I don't recall seeing UltraViolet mentioned and I don't recall any mention of the process necessary to actually download the movie when I ordered. Maybe they did, but I think Amazon should have a clear warning since this is SO different from what most people think of as a digital copy. If I knew then what I know now, I never would have ordered it. Now that I've had this experience, I doubt I will ever order a movie with a digital copy through Amazon again."
1,Great movie - rip off blue ray,"My original review was that this was a great movie. It was, but I just got a copy for christmas & I CAN'T PLAY IT UNLESS I AM HOOKED UP TO THE INTERNET. They don't tell you that ULTRA VIOLET MEANS IT WON'T PLAY ON YOUR BLUE RAY PLAYER!!!! I am so angry about this, I can't believe that they - WARNER BROS - think they have the right to determine how I watch a movie I PAID FOR."
1,Shame on Warner Brothers -- SHAM,Shame on Warner Brothers for advertising the Flixster service as a true digital copy. I am weighing whether I should return the disc or keep it. Shame.
1,Not Purchasing,"I've read several reviews regarding the issue of ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy."" As it turns out, you need an application to play your digital copy (DC) called Flixter. The million dollar question that everyone is asking is if you're still able to play it on your iPod, other devices. The answer is no. To play your DC, you need to be online. What's the point? If I was on a plane, train etc with no internet access, how am I to enjoy a movie that I paid for? As the number of combo movie purchases are made, Flixter (DC) offers a nasty alternative and I hope Flixter dwindles."
1,No iTunes Digital Copy :(,Really disappointed that they don't have an iTunes digital copy. iTunes versions make it so easy to watch on AppleTV or iPhone. Hopefully they come out with a package that has a real digital copy in it. I'll pass until then.
1,"Great movie, don't by Ultraviolet","I have really enjoyed every HP movie, but I won't be buying this version for one reason and one reason alone. Ultraviolet. It is not a digital copy as you know it. Others have detailed why; I bought Horrible Bosses and learned for myself. Want to listen on a plane? Forget it. In a place with no wi-fi? Forget it. Want it to work in iTunes? Forget it. Want to avoid creating new accounts with web services you could care less about? Forget it (you have to create two different accounts to get Ultraviolet to work - couldn't even make that easy for you). Worried about paying for KB usage on your wireless device when carriers change their plans based on usage? You should be - you'll essentially be paying to watch this movie each time you watch it.My recommendation - buy an AppleTV and buy it through iTunes."
1,Ultraviolet means ultrabad,Great movie and really want to buy the combo but ultraviolet is a loser format. Got burned on green lantern and so never again.
3,harry potter deathly hallow part 2,still the book was alot better than movie 2 duals were better in the books even Nevel killing the snake4 was better in the book. The surprise was still alive when i read the book i wanted to see how the movie was goint to do it. It just did not live up to the book.
5,So sad the last Harry Potter,"I really enjoyed the final Harry Potter movie and was glad to see the ending with Harry, Hermione and Ron ending up happily married."
5,Gift for Girlfriend,This movie was really well done and concluded nicely in a little bow tie.I bought this to finish out my girlfriends collection of all the other Harry Potter movies. Worth the cyber Monday deals to get also!
5,Awesome!,"Exceeded my expectations!! I was truly blown away by how artistically creative this movie was. Very well-portrayed, and the actors all were very believable."
5,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 Blu-Ray",I love this package. The extras on the disc were worth it. A must for anyone who loves Harry Potter.
1,STAY AWAY FROM ULTRAVIOLET!!!,"Ultraviolet is another feeble, doomed attempt by some dinosaur brain Hollywood execs to restrict the use of your legally bought digital purchase. Ultraviolet is NOT a digital copy that resides on a device of your choice to be used on a device of your choice. It is a streaming service, for which you have to sign up and maintain an account, at the expense of your bandwidth, compatible with some but not all mobile devices. If you're willing to wait another 4 weeks, order this disc set from Amazon's UK website you can do this with your current US account). Not only are you getting a REAL digital copy, but the Blu-ray disc is region free too!! Price + shipping is the same as the price in USD with free shipping."
1,Digital Copy is not what you would expect. Ultraviolet is awful.,"Digital Copy usually means that you are purchasing the ability to download the movie to iTunes or other player. This Ultraviolet ""digital copy"" does not work with iTunes and it looks like you have to stream it versus having the ability to load it onto an iPad or iPhone for viewing without an internet connection - like on a flight.My kids and I are not happy with this ""Digital Copy""."
1,Don't Buy This Copy ! Ultraviolet Digital Copy = HORRIBLE,"I love this movie. I was all set to purchase and then they changed it to UltraViolet video copy. This means no local copy on your computer/device. So when I'm on planes, trains and automobiles and watching my digital copies and they have no Wi-Fi you CANT WATCH IT!!!!! So when I'm flying across the atlantic and the nearest wifi hotspot is a thousand miles away I""d be staring at blank screen.This is stupid! Fight back, don't buy. Buy it from Amazon Movies or iTunes and get your hard copy."
1,Ultraviolet Digital Copy is Misleading,The digital copy coupled with this Blu-Ray set is more aptly named unlimited streaming copy. Which does me no good unless I have internet available. Why would WB not include a standard iTunes copy like every other Studio out there. I rate the movie Five Stars I rate Warner brothers less then one.
5,Blu Ray great,"I saw the rating was bad for harry potter on here then I learned it was because people hate the ultraviolet blu ray. Well, I never use my digital copies anyway because I feel they take up too much space on my Laptop so I don't even bother. I dont watch movies on my computer anyway. The Blu Ray has a great picture and sound also has wonderful amount of bonus material."
2,It's a lie!,This DVD while an excellent movie...the packaging is totally misleading! There is NO digital copy as it was known! You have to join 2 separate website/apps and then you still may not be able to see the movie! It's downloaded to a specific location which you cannot access without the program/app to view it...you cannot see it in iTunes! Last time I buy any dvd with digital copy that does not allow itunes or windows media to play!
1,hmmmm.........,the last chapter sucked bad. the ending was predictable and boring. the epic fight turned out to be a flop. the story sucked at all levels no creativity involved a rank amateur could have written a better script to close out the final chapter.
2,"LOVE the movie, DVD is almost Unwatchable","Saw this movie twice in the theaters, was given (I confess) a Russian bootleg copy before this release, and then bought this official release happily. Problem is, the DVD transfer is horrible -- sure, the films are dark, but half of this DVD is so dark I can barely make out what is happening. Had I not seen it several times before I would not have known what I was missing -- frustrating!!! It ain't my TV, other movies look fine. This needs to be redone more carefully. A real bummer. My bootleg copy is visually flawed, but I swear this is worse. I call a do-over!"
2,UltraVoilet makes for UltraViolence,"The movie is great. The blu-ray is sharp and the extras are really neat. So why did I give this item a low rating? The ""digital copy"" is horrible. I travel and like to bring movies on my iPad. The digital copy of this movie must be streamed thru the UltraViolet site. Really??? I am not happy. What a waste. That must be why the item was cheaper than I expected."
2,No special features except deleted scenes on DVD version,I was extremely disappointed that the DVD version of this movie doesn't contain any special features except deleted scenes. I would have been more than happy to pay more for them. I don't want to have to by Blue Ray version for the special features. I don't understand why they can't be delivered on both. I suppose they want to push me to Blue Ray.
1,Cheated out of true digital copy,"The Ultraviolet ""digital copy"" is a sham and a cruel joke. I was lookimg forward to loading this onto my iPad but now, thanks to the deception known as Ultraviolet, that will never happen. This is false advertising and WB should be ashamed. I wonder if Amazon will give me my money back! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED, but love the series."
1,Digital Copy Not What It Seems,"I have little new to add to the current string of 1 stars other than Amazon should have been more upfront with its customers about what we were getting into. I purchased this copy months ago when all that was advertised was a ""Digital Copy"". This is incompatible with iTunes, and therefore useless to me. Buyer beware: if you order for a functional digital copy, you'll be disappointed."
2,Ultraviolet s/b Ultra rip off,"I share the opinion of other reviewers.""Ultraviolet is another feeble, doomed attempt by some dinosaur brain Hollywood execs to restrict the use of your legally bought digital purchase. Ultraviolet is NOT a digital copy that resides on a device of your choice to be used on a device of your choice. It is a streaming service, for which you have to sign up and maintain an account, at the expense of your bandwidth, compatible with some but not all mobile devices.""I believe Amazon should be very explicit about what ""digital copy"" is being sold. I am pretty sure the ""Ultraviolet digital copy"" was not what I was sold as a pre-order. As stated by another viewer it is not a ""copy"", it is a service. I will not spend the extra money for ""Ultraviolet digital copy"" on any other Amazon DVD. This is a rip off."
2,Bought the wrong thing!,I bought this thinking it was the blue-ray plus a digital copy that I download to iTunes. I have all of the previous movies and this would have completed my collection. Instead I discover I am only able to download it to something called Flixster!!! I don't want Flixster I just want a regular digital copy!!! Very annoyed!!!! Be sure to check before buying to find out what kind of download it comes with!!!
1,UltraViolet Digital Copy is HORRIBLE - NOT A DIGITAL COPY!,Great GREAT movie. This is one of the thousands of protest ratings due to the incredible insult to consumers by the braindead movie executives. NOT a digital copy - this is a stream service and it is CRAP! Burn your own or pirate it. FAIL. GIVE US THE DIGITAL COPY WE PAID FOR!
1,"Great movie, but the UltraViolet system is so bad, the total package is 1 star","It took me 30 minutes to create accounts and read agreements, 45 minutes to read up on UltraViolet, and I haven't even seen the movie yet!VERY unhappy consumer."
2,Disappointed with UltraViolet,"I'm very disappointed with the"" UltraViolet Digital Copy"" I was under the wrong impression that I was receiving a ""Downloadable copy"" that I could store on my Laptop for future use such as traveling so I would have to carry the disks with me.Well this is my own fault I should have read the fine print prior to ordering."
1,Ultraviolet Digital Copy is a LIE!,"I love Harry Potter and the Harry Potter movies. In fact, I own all 8 of them on Bluray, DVD and Digital copy. Well, all 8 of them EXCEPT Deathly Hallows part 2. I bought what I thought would be Bluray, DVD and Digital copy. What I GOT was Bluray, DVD and Ultraviolet.BE WARNED!! Ultraviolet IS NOT a true digital copy. Ultraviolet is more like digital streaming than a digital copy. Sure, you can sort of download what seems like a digital copy, but If you had a digital copy, you would have a digital file that resides on your computer that could be copied to other devices and watched offline. Ultraviolet is anything BUT that.Ultraviolet is a complete pain in the butt. What a terrible idea. Nothing will push me to bit torrent faster than this Ultraviolet BS. Way to go Warner Bros, I hope you're happy. You just lost a customer."
2,48 hour rental experience,"This was my first experience with the 48 hour rental from Amazon. And probably my last, unless I hear that they overhaul the player. $3.99 is a little steep in the age of Netflix, but when you're in the mood for Harry Potter... When I stream things at home from Hulu, Netflix or other sites the quality is great. As the film opened the quality was terrible, pixelated to the point that we could barely see what was happening. We stopped it, exited out and restarted, which helped a great deal. With about a half hour left, the movie froze up. We waited for 5 minutes or so and ended up having to re-start it again and find our place, wait for it to load. And then it would not allow us to use full screen! It just wouldn't! I like Amazon for many things, streaming video is not one of them. My advice - buy movies on DVD from Amazon, stream from Netflix. Oh, FYI, we really enjoyed the movie- as a film despite the stupid proprietory player issues :)"
2,Harry potter the final episode,"My purpose in purchasing this dvd was to complete my series. I've enjoyed all the movies. My primary concern then would be quality of the dvd. This one disappointed me as the video was so dark, it was difficult to see the characters in many of the scenes. I'd seen the movie on TV and though some scenes were dark, nothing like this dvd. So, I was disappointed in the quality of the dvd itself, but the movie was great."
1,Ultraviolet is horrible. PS. The movie is great.,"I preordered this like I do most of my blu-rays explicitly for the digital copy which I import into iTunes and use on my iPhones, iPad, and stream to my Apple TV. When I preordered there was no mention of this Ultraviolet crap. Ultraviolet does not allow you to download to Macs. This is like stealing. Plus the setup is far too long. All I want is to play this on my iPad without worries about finding an internet connection. I'll never but another blu-ray with Ultracrappy until this is resolved.Oh yeah, I loved the movie. When I saw it in the theaters."
1,"Enjoyed the Movie, Ultraviolet Digital Copy Sucks","I enjoyed watching the movie last night (4 star). I bought the 3D version from Best Buy yesterday to complete our Harry Potter collection. As long as WB has this crappy Ultraviolet Digital Copy, I will be thinking twice about purchasing any future titles. I can wait to rent."
1,Digital copy rip off!,"I have purchased previous Harry Potter movies with the digital copy and have never had a problem downloading an iTunes version. This version however is a STREAMING version, as in you don't actually get to own the copy. I bought this DVD specifically for the digital copy and I am sooooo angry to have been ripped off. I don't have a DVD player, I only wanted the digital version and I want it on my IPAD, not a laptop. And then there's the whole streaming thing which for some people isn't possible because not everyone has high speed Internet. So yah, thanks WB for wasting my money. I will NEVER buy another ""ultraviolet"" digital copy again."
2,Great Movie...Bad WB for Ultralight,"We love the HP movies and will miss not having anymore to look forward to. Great ending to the series. I didn't purchase this movie from Amazon, because many folks posted it wasn't going to be available in US with Blu-Ray 3d. Was able to purchase at Best Buy last weekend. The blu-ray 3D disc had issues in one scene of the movie, so I had to return it. Additionally, there is no digital copy in what the average consumer thinks of a Digital Copy. This ultraviolet thing is a waste and I wouldn't recommend it. NOTE: If you contact Ultraviolet and complain they will provide you an Itunes Code, thereby I was satisfied with my purchase. But I shouldn't have to complain about something to get what I thought I was purchasing. Call it anything you want but its not a digital copy in the minds of most consumers. I give two stars for the movie but the fact that I had to return the 3D disc and complain about the digital copy, quite a dissapointment in product quality for HP7.2."
3,The Last Potter,"This is a good video; however, my husband swears that there are scenes missing from the movie that were in the original movie when we saw it in the theater. After watching more closely I agreed with him."
4,"Good movie, do your research on Ultraviolet!","My wife and I very much enjoyed this movie, watched it in the theater.Do some research for unbiased information on Ultraviolet - if you can find unbiased info. :)Ultraviolet is being launched in two phases. It's brand new, the first step is streaming only. Once phase two is implemented (I think spring 2012) the downloadable portion of it will start working.So, for now - Ultraviolet is basically useless. You have the disc, and most of the time streaming for a portable device is impractical. However, starting next year, your movie will suddenly become download-able, and transferable between up to 12 devices.Ultraviolet is the next big thing coming from the movie business. There will be some amount of 'warring' between KeyChest (Apple/Disney) and Ultraviolet. The big question now is whether this will ever work on the ubiquitous iDevices.Launching UV in it's unfinished state was a _royally stupid_ idea."
1,No Digital Copy!!!,"One More Time! My older eMac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 is file compatible with the latest MacBook, the iPad2, and our Airport Extreme router. But this fake streaming video garbage calling itself UltraViolet Digital Copy is NOT compatible! It is NOT a digital copy, and as many times as they ram it down my throat telling me that it is, will not change the fact that it is NOT! Digital Copy is a lie!!! Don't tell me your giving me something (and worse yet are charging me for the licensing) when you are NOT! Liars all!"
4,Removing one Star due to Unusable Content,"I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing this here. But on sale for $18.99, I felt it was a good bargain on a Blu Ray I just had to have for the grandkids, to add to the Potter Collection we already have. The movie is five stars. The picture on Blu Ray is out of this world. Truly phenomenal movie and wonderful ending ! The marketing at Amazon should be up front with people when presenting ""ultraviolet digital copy"". Who knew you had to pay to view it?? That was deceitful and wrong. Glad I have the movie, but not happy about Amazon's marketing of this otherwise five-star product."
4,UltraViolet Copy - 2 hours and still trying,"Seriously. Why do I need to jump through hoops in order to get a digital copy of the movie. I have had to download and redownload and lost password, etc. I miss the ease of itunes downloads."
1,Special features only available to Blu-ray customers,"I am getting sick and tired of the priority placed on Blu-ray products. I do not have a Blu-ray player, and as a poor student with no television and only a laptop to watch DVDs, I will not be getting one in the near future. So the fact that the special features on one of my favorite movies are ONLY available on a Blu-ray disc is simply unacceptable. A 2-disc DVD copy of this film does exist, but it only has half of the special features and is not even sold by Amazon anymore, as far as I can tell. This pushing of a technology whose benefit is questionable in the first place and the consequent disenfranchisement of potential customers is profoundly infuriating."
1,Not a real digital copy!,"If you are looking to purchase this item and receive a digital copy you can download to iTunes you will be very upset. Please, just purchase the DVD or Blu-Ray because the ultra-violet copy is only available for streaming and cannot be downloaded to iTunes. And you have to open the video to find this out, unless someone tells you first. This is one angry consumer!"
1,DO NOT BUY ULTRAVIOLET,"It is not a real digital copy like companies used to include. I want a digital copy in my iTunes library That way it will play through Apple TV or on any of my iDevices. This will not do that. Will not buy any more UV ""digital copies"""
1,Digital Copy is just garbage! The Blue-Ray disc was bad out of the box,"So, this was a Christmas present for my kids. The Blue-Ray disc has some problem that prevents it from being read properly by our player and the UV service is completely unusable. Like others, I thought I was getting a real digital copy to download to iTunes, but instead we have have yet to be able to view the movie. The customer service from Flixster for the UV service is completely unresponsive. I just submitted my second ticket with them after no response. Not even the automated response assigning a ticket tracking number.If at all possible avoid this product if you're looking for Digital copy."
4,The Blu-Ray is great; Ultra-Violet is a let down though,"The Blu-Ray transfer of the film is truly a great experience visually. The darks are sustained and the color scheme is really protected and done justice by the Blu-Ray. If you haven't heard, the Ultra-Violet digital copy is sort of a scam and truly is a big negative about this package, as you have to subscribe a service and the digital copy actually expires after a year. But the extra DVD is a plus considering that the price is only a few dollars more than the single-disc Blu-Ray package."
2,Deathly...Died,"The Part 1 was pretty good, followed along the lines of the book better than any of the previous movies. The Part 2 not only fell back into the bad habits of the first six movies, it fell off the cliff! Left out too many of the major parts of the book. And what was substitued left much to be desired!Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2"
1,Digital Copy is Not What You Want - Look Carefully!,The UltraViolet Digital Copy is NOT a download but a stream option that includes needing an on-line account.I just saw the digital copy for my preorder and did not look carefully - do not make the same mistake I did!
2,Digital Copy Fail,"It would be nice if I could review the film separately from the packaged product. However, I am extremely disappointed that Warner Bros. decided to switch to Ultraviolet during the last Harry Potter offering. Simply put, I intentionally purchased Blu-Ray's which included digital copies so that they could be available on my iPad while travelling WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION. So, while my previous Harry Potters have been loaded onto my iPad, Warner Bros just lost a customer with this one.But I guess this is what happens when you legitimately purchase things you could otherwise download for free..."
1,Ultra violet as the digital copy makes this a loser.,Ultra violet as the digital copy makes this a loser. When will the studios stop doing this. You can only watch your movie when streaming. What if you just want to watch it like any other digital copy? Can't.
2,LOVE HARRY POTTER HATE DIGITAL DOWNLOAD,"Ok first off want to say that I love the world of harry potter and I give the move 5 starts.The reason I spent time to do this review was because of how disappointed I am with my digital download. This is why I spent extra to buy this version. Why do companies have to change the status quo of things when they worked fine before. ON all other harry potter movies the digital download came from Itunes so why change it now??? A digital copy to everyone on the planet means ITUNES. So when you get home and look forward to downloading your movie to ITunes, then find out now you have to use a new special service called UltraViolet and a app called flixter that just burns me! I was hoping to make everyone aware of this as I bought this on Amazon and did not see the box or description when I preordered this months ago."
1,"Bait and Switch, UltraViolet is not Apple compatible","After buying the DVD with digital copyHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy), I was stunned and disappointed of the process to utilize the digital movie. I had expressly procurred this version for the viewing on my iPad and iPhone. Expecting to just enter the code in iTunes, I had to register on a difference site, download additional apps, and attempt to view a most unreliable stream to my devices. I have yet to be able to see it on my Apple TV.Well, now I understand UltraViolet and will not waste my money on buying another Ultraviolet digital copy in the future. I wish I didn't buy this one."
1,Digital copy is a sham!! Not iTunes compatible. NOt Worth buying Digital Copy,Digital copy is a sham!! Not iTunes compatible. It is truly not Not Worth buying Digital Copy. I love movies that come with digital copy and i feel i got ripped of i might return it for spite and just get the regular version. I hope you take this into consideration went thinking (hopefully not thinking) of buying this product. Thank You. Matthew
1,Digital Copy Sucked,"GIVE ME ITUNES DOWNLOAD!!!!!! I HATE ULTRAVIOLET!!! DUMB DUMB DUMB!!!! Do not buy if you are intending to use DC as main medium. Purchase on iTunes, much happier experience."
1,Doesn't Play in ITunes,"The movie is fine, the problem is the digital copy is unuseable. Every digital movie I have purchased in the past 5 years has either come with a physical file or an iTunes download, not the case with this product. You are forced to download some lame Flixster software to your computer, it will not play in iTunes at all. Want to watch it on your apple TV you're screwed, grab your family and huddle around the laptop. Want to watch it on your ipad or iphone, you have to download the flixster app, and have an internet connection, because it only plays via streaming. Want to watch it on a plane you are screwed and out of luck."
1,Digital Copy?????????? Ultraviolet....urgh.,"To begin, I love the Harry Potter films and I was very excited to purchase this Blu Ray when it arrived in stores this past Friday. However, this Ulatrviolet digital copy sucks! I can't transfer it onto my ipad2, or ipod, therefore, it is useless for me. I would have saved my money and bought the regular Blu Ray had I known this. I assumed that the film would be accesssable throught the cloud as well as being able to transfer it to my portable devices. Nope. I'm totally disappointed because I use my ipad2 daily and I travel for work, so I enjoy being able to have digital copies of the movies that I BUY ON MY IPAD! Having only cloud acces it useless for me. I signed up for both services, but will most likely not use them. This does not fit my needs, and I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY UNLESS I CAN X-FER TO MY DEVICES. I'M COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED."
1,Digital Download Abduction,Movie fine..Ultraviolet/Flixster download not worth the time and process. Another slap at consumer use rights. When are the studios going to get it that consumers don't want over-arching controls.....when we quite buying and using their junk.
1,"I thought it was a DIGITAL COPY, not a STREAMING COPY.","I didn't know what Ultraviolet was, but now I do and, as a digital copy enthusiast, I regret my purchase. I'm thinking of returning my copy and just buying one from iTunes."
1,Great movie but package missing the movie...,"This is a great movie, but when I opened my copy I found 1 DVD disc and 2 special feature blu ray discs -- but no blu ray movie. Clearly a packaging error, but it was very disappointing. I'll be returning it, and likely will choose just the blu ray version since the digital copy is standard definition anyway (as discussed in other reviews)."
1,Stop UltraViolet,UltraViolet is a short-sighted power grab. It is poorly executed and ill-conceived. I sincerely hope that sales are dropping for the films that ship with UltraViolet. And I hope that any talent that benefits from deals containing a share of DVD/Blu-ray revenue starts making their voices heard as well. This format needs to disappear.
1,Digital copy is a joke,As other folks stated - UltraViolet digital copy is a joke. You need to use Flixster app to watch it. There is no way to load it to iTunes. WB is a joke.
1,Ultra Violet the worst idea almost ever - Great service from Amazon as always...,Amazon comes through again; my package was here the day it was released and the family enjoyed watching it again. The movie was lovely and a great way to end the series - I always think the battle scenes are too long but that's what fast forward is about. JK did a great job and it's sad the saga is at an end. Congratulations to her.My big disappointment is with the studio not the movie itself. WB released another form of UltraViolet years ago - a downloadable movie that stayed on your computer...if I'm home why would I watch a movie on my computer? If I can't put it on my iPod classic what's the point? The web-site is difficult; I am still having problems with my account which they have failed to help me resolve. Universal's digital downloads are delightfully easy and go where I want them to...Guess who's movies I will prefer to purchase in the future?
1,Bought this version to get the digital copy - not happy,"I had no idea when I preordered this that it would not have a ""real"" digital copy that I could download to iTunes. Instead it's a limited three-year streaming copy that requires an account and internet connection. Would never have bought this version, but just the blu-ray, if I had known. Very disappointed. Will avoid anything with Ultraviolet in the future. What a waste of my money."
4,Always Enjoy the Potter Movies,My children enjoyed the book series and we as a family really enjoyed the movies. We went to the theater to see them all and then have added them to our video collection. Every once in awhile we do a Harry Potter Marathon and watch them all weekend.
5,gift for my wife,"amazing quality, amazing movie. could not have wished for a better gift for my wife this christmas, as she is Harry Potter Fan"
5,Good value and I enjoyed the end!,"First, As always, Amazon does a pretty good job on the price. Next, Deathly Hallows part 2 was a pretty good ending to a great story. i started buying the movies for my kids. I ended up finishing them for me. Pretty good story with darn good graphics. I highly recommend it."
5,BEST MOVIE OF ENTIRE SERIES,"LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT! This finale lived up to my expectations and more. I love that Snape turned out to be Harry's Guardian Angel, after all. I also love the way Malfoy pussied out."
2,REAL review vs. ultraviolet B.S.,"Was it just me, or did no one else have a problem with the editing in this film? Too many scenes seemed unfinished or unexplained, or simply not brought to a reasonable conclusion. The Gringott's scene seemed to have quite a bit of action just ""finishing"" to soon and without the ordinary detail one has come to expect with this series. Who was it in the Weasley family that Ron was crying so desperately over? All Weasleys seemed to be accounted for and right there mourning the death of some unknown redheaded person. Far too many other instances to name. I watched this on PPV, and wonder if perhaps there was some problem with the cable company's version, or if it was the movie in general."
5,Ultraviolent Not An Issue If Blu-Ray or DVD Also Offered,"(This review will probably be duplicated by Amazon for other offerings of Deathly Hallows Part 2 than the one I am writing about, but if the other offerings give you a DVD or Blu-ray AS WELL AS Ultraviolent, my following comments still apply.) Some reviewers are very critical of this 3-Disc + Ultraviolent special because of concerns about Ultraviolent. It does not really matter what one thinks of Ultraviolent. I just received my order and you get a regular DVD of the movie AND a Blu-ray disc of the movie plus a disc of the special features. Ultraviolent is AN ADDITIONAL OPTION that you do not need to pursue unless you want to and are able to. Just watch the DVD or Blu-ray of the movie just like you watch any other DVD or Blu-ray. If you decide to do that and not use the Ultraviolent option, the price is still very reasonable. No problem. As for the movie itself, I think it is great."
5,Big Harry Potter fan,Always loved the Harry Potter series of films. This is just a great addition to the collection. Great DVD to own.
4,Good Ending to the Film Series,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two"" was for me a good ending to the film version of the Harry Potter series. I personally found it better to watch both parts together so as to be able to follow the action a little more closely. There was much to like about this film the action scenes were done well, and there was more than enough drama and pathos to keep me interested. I enjoyed seeing Neville Longbottom getting to be a heroic figure, I hope we will see more of this actor along with the rest of the young cast get to do more films and shows they are all excellent. My only quibble is that Voldimort's death should have been a little moredramatic. It seemed almost anti-climatic to me. As for the digital copy I have no complaints about it. I also wonder why the spine of the DVD case is different from all the others??"
5,"Great movie, great value!",This is the cheapest blu-ray of this movie I have found. Its a great movie and I recommend to all those HP fans!
4,good christmas gift,"I got this as a christmas gift for my sister. She seems to like it so all is good. I myself am not a harry potter fan, but she seems to love it."
1,Deathly Hallows Part 2,"The DVD only came with the disc. No case or anything. I read the item description again and nowhere did it say that the item was missing a case. I didn't have the time to return it, now it's too late. Bad seller."
5,Best movie of 2011,"Best movie of the series by far and possibly best movie ever. Look at the ratings, either five star, loved it, or 1 star, haters."
1,Horrible Service via Flixter,"The accounts were easy enough to set up, but that was the only easy thing about downloading the digital copy. I have been plagued by errors, and it's been an hour since it started downloading, and it still isn't finished. The movie is good, but do NOT buy the version with the Ultraviolet copy, you will regret it."
1,rubish,How can I write a review if the DVD will not play in my player. all it says is wrong region. KI dont live in the states I live in Great Britain! Yes I did buy it from Amazon.0 stars ican't rate it if I can't watch it
2,Ultar-Violet,"Just another incident in a long list of things corporations do to rob people blind. Most companies are nothing but crooks today, and Hollywood is full of the people that are synonymous with the word crooked. Do not get this junky rip off that makes you sign up and get billed and isn't very good anyhow.BEWARE OF SCAM!!!!!"
4,A fairly good movie,Finally it has ended! But what a crappy ending. It was all intense until the final battle. It felt rushed and weak. 4 stars
1,Glad the movie ended,"Books 10 stars, but they ruined this movie. Rewrote the whole blanking thing. If you read the book, forget watching this movie. The pain of what they did to it was too much to bare. I waited till Xmas special $8 HD to see if it was as bad as I remember in theater."
3,Ehhh. Just Ehhh,"Kids I am sure will love it. In terms of the entire line of movies, there were 3 or 4 too many. The last two were just a confusing recycled mess.I give it 3 stars because as a movie it was entertaining, which, is the point, right meme?Here is a more accurate rating:Kids: 4.5 starsAdults: 2 stars"
2,Too Dark,"The movie was great in the theater, but the DVD version is too dark. Details are obscure in many scenes."
4,Harry,Great movie. Very good way to end the whole series. It ties alot of things from prior movies. Very enjoyable.
5,Amazing DVD at an amazing price,"Wow, I can't believe the deal on this one (got it on a lightening deal for $2)! Such a great film. The ultraviolet format comes as a code, and we have not tried to use this yet. Others have said this doesn't work that well, I can't speak to that, but the DVD is wonderful, and that is why I purchased this copy."
5,Great Movie. UltraViolet Digital Copy???,"This is a fantastic movie.As for the ultaviolet copy, Im actually liking it.Its like netflix, but maybe better. I buy the combo packs so that I have the bluray and the dvd in case I have a family member or friend who wants to watch it. I like to have a digital copy, but if I really want one I can buy one at iTunes. The beauty of ultraviolet is that I can buy a film for myself, and share it with family and friends who I let into the account. It like sharing my Netflix. Thats what I care about, sharing it. And the ultraviolet make that easier. and I think this is going to be fantastic. I will buy a movie and I can share it for free with my family and friends! How is that not good?:-)___________________________________I finally found the site to download it---took a while.[...]"
4,"The book was great, the movie was not!","The last installment of Harry Potter was a brilliant narrative by the author. Unfortunately, the movie studios butchered it. So much was left out that unless you read the book, you must have been perplexed. Dumbledore was not the shining white knight the movie made him out to be. He was killed when he tried to possess the Deathly Hallows for himself. That is why Harry Potter was the ""better man"". The fight scene was whittled down to a total botch job when compared to the book. I was so looking forward to the marching desks on the attack. So much was changed that it affected the characters representation. If you want to know what really happened, read the book."
1,Digital copy....NOT,"WB has made something so simple, loading a digital copy into iTunes, impossible.To use this digital copy, you have to install WB's own buggy app on your device. This is a ripoff, don't waste your time or money to get any digital copies from WB studios!"
4,"Blu Ray is great, Ultraviolet is a joke","The film itself is beautiful on Blu Ray and the special features are no disappointment. However, with that said, the so-called ""digital copy"" is not an actual copy at all. It's just an access code to stream the movie via the Flixster app, which means you have to have wifi to watch it. This could be incredibly problematic on a plane or anywhere where internet is not available. This is just slightly left of false advertising. Very disappointing. Comes with a DVD though. Tip - use HANDBRAKE for your digital copy;)"
3,May need to update your BluRay Player,amazon.com sent me two of the Blu Ray combos and neither would load on my Samsung BD player. I have called Samsung Customer Support and they are going to send an update that will play the new movies coming out in Blu Ray. People are having trouble with this BD combo--i.e. not being able to load the BluRay disc. The DVD in the combo pack works great in the BluRay player so you can watch it until you update your Blu Ray player.
1,LESS FOR MORE,"I am in complete agreement with all the other reviewers who rated the WB release of this ""Ultra Violet"" version with one or two stars. The film is great however, this release is inferior The ""Ultra Violet"" does not work and the regular DVD copy does not have a chapter menu/index. Your only choice is to play the entire feature and skip through the scenes manually. The blu-ray copy does not work in any of my players so I feel like I received less product for more money. I will likely reaturn this for a regular DVD version only."
5,amazing,best of all eight films. thank you David Yates you have finally redeemed yourself. i was completely blown away by this film
1,Not a real digital copy,"Add our negative vote to the others. This set does not include a *real* digital copy, the kind you can save to your phone or iPad. It requires an active internet connection and a separate account to manage. Really lame. Why can't we just have the content we buy, the way they know we want it? We'll pay for it!"
5,Great movie,"Took about 7 business days to get, but was worth it! Great quality! Great movie! Great ending! Sad to know this will be the last."
1,Flixster & UltraViolet,"While the movie was great, the Flixster & UltraViolet is just horrible. While I was able to load it into my Flixster account, when I linked my UltraViolet account, it disappeared. When I tried to re-add it, I was over my limit. Tonight I wasted four hours creating accounts for Sony, Universal, UltraViolet, and Flixster. Lots, and lots, and lots of aggravation. If am stunned that this product every made it through beta testing. I wrote Flixster and still am waiting to hear back. If I don't get anything by the end of the week, I will ditch Flixster and UltraViolet... never to be tried again.If anyone from Flixster or UltraViolet read this, I would encourage you to look at Amazon or iTunes. Real easy to use. To anyone buying this and thinking you are going to watch this on anything but your TV... good luck."
4,HP part2,"Movie-wise, the director wasn't that great. To my taste, he relied a little too much on Star Wars-esque flashiness and spell-shooting. Then toward the end, he wanted to cut short the important death scenes (Fred!) and lengthen the cheesy ones (Bellatrix!). But disc-wise, I'm thinking, ""Really? This is the last movie of the entire series, and they wanna sell it on ONE disc?"" I guess wait til the last minute and see if they release something a little more hefty to give it a proper send-off...? O.o"
4,UltraViolet digital copy will be uesless,"I have preordered this, and can't wait to get it, but -1 star for the UltraViolet Digital Copy. Please offer an iTunes option, or let's save a buck or two and drop the digital copy altogether."
4,"Good movie, get it from UK","Just pre-ordered the Region Free 3D Bluray from Amazon UK. With a 2D version blu ray , a DVD and a real Digital copy. It will be released on Dec. 2"
1,stay away from ultraviolet digital copy,I am giving 1 star because of the fact that Warner is providing ultraviolet digital copy. I just cancelled my pre-order on the US Amazon site and purchased the same movie from the UK Amazon website(same price with a true digital copy). The Ultraviolet digital copy wont even work on most digital devices. I use ipad and iphone and it does not support this digital version.
2,Ultraviolet copy cheap ploy for flixter,Haven't even had time to watch this movie yet with all the time involved in getting the ultraviolet copy to work. Cant watch the movie through I tunes on my Mac or iPad. Had to install two programs just to get it running.....and then more passwords and two accounts later you can see a streamed version. What kind of deal did they get from Flixter anyway!
1,"A ""STREAM"" of horse manure","Hollywood studios still don't get it. It's bad enough we can't play our media we've legally payed for on the devices we own, now we have to deal with UltraViolet. I refuse to buy this piece of crap, like others I will wait for the region free UK version. What was wrong with the iTunes/Windows Media style of digital copy? This is a slap in the face of legal media purchasers, and will only increase pirating. It's time the old farts at the studios retired and let those people who understand consumers younger than 75 handle their digital distribution."
2,Harry Potter And the Deathly Hallows pt 2 3-d,HORRIBLE TRANSFER!!!! Only purchase if u wanna be Dizzzy!! For those who own 3-D tV's they know wat im talking about! Pass on this! For me a 5 star is James Camerons Titanic- thats wat im talking about! Thats how u transfer a movie to 3-D period!
5,Outstanding!,"This movie was extremely exciting, mysterious and had a lot of surprises. The scenery was extraordinary and the screen effects were beautiful.I'm sorry to see the series be over. Thank you Amazon for getting me a great price and fast delivery."
1,Ultra violet is totally crap. Avoid !!!!!,"Stay away from Ultra Violet. Deserves ZERO stars. Total crap!! Other reviewers are correct in the ""Stay away"" advice. What a major scam!!!!!"
1,"Good Movie. Ultra Violet ""Digital Copy"" is Ridiculous.","""Digital Copy"" does not exist. You can ""stream"" through Ultraviolet's crappy service. No internet connection? No digital copy. JUNK. AVOID!"
2,Love Harry,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing, the digital copy is a joke. I would would not recommend this version."
2,Ultraviolet,"The movie is fantastic and a great finish to the series. However, if you are looking for the digital copy this isn't it, it's digital streaming and very difficult to setup and then you have yet one more system to deal with. Complain to Fixster and they will provide an I-tunes code to download a true digital copy. I for one will not buy any additional Ultraviolet digital copies!"
3,DVD,"This was a Christmas gift. As far as I know, it was ""liked"". I don't know if it's been watched, yet, but it was what was asked for."
2,Unhappy with digital copy,"I'm a fan of the movies and specifically purchased the combo pack so I would have a digital copy to easily play from our Apple TV or on my iPad when traveling like previous digital editions available from iTunes. This digital edition is available from UltraViolet & Flixter, which requires new accounts and additional applications to play the digital edition. I wish now that I would have just purchased the plain DVD or Blu-Ray option instead of the combo pack."
1,RIP OFF! SHAME!!!!! PETITION!,"They are sadly right. On Deathly Hallows Part 1 I was able to download this movie to my computer and watch it on my ipod. With Part 2 they ripped people off with Warner Brothers invading your computer for marketing purposes. SHAME ON YOU!!!!! I will NEVER by another DVD with this Ultra Garbage! I threw the redemtion paperwork in the garbage!!!! This is another example of hollywood making more CGI movies with 3D garbage, trending further with poor screenplays and a rip off mentality. It's too bad hollywood has moved to wanting money instead of making good movies. Even though this movie was good, Green Lantern was garbage!!! This DVD says ""Digital Copy!!!"" That's a sick consumer LIE!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! YOU ARE ROTTEN SICK PEOPLE!!!"
2,"Great movie, but...","I loved the movie it was great, but I bought the three pack,Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy, because that is what I wanted. The fact that I can't use MY digital copy on all MY devices, really fracks me off. Just rude and really upsetting of the company to pull such an underhanded move."
2,Big rip off.,"I am so disappointed in this. The movie, of course, is wonderful. I don't have a blu ray player, but I ordered the movie on blu ray because the regular dvd had no special features and I figured at least I could see the special features on the digital copy. WRONG. First of all, the digital copy is ""unavailable"" from ultraviolet flixster scamware, and the special features aren't included on there anyway. I've bought every special edition Harry Potter movie and I am hugely unhappy that since I don't have blu ray, I don't get to see the special features. Way to alienate your fanbase!"
4,Very Good 3D!,"This is a Very Good 3D movie, but not quite as good as Avatar! The action does come out at you more and in a place or two the embers do seem to float out of the screen. It is a close second to Avatar in my opinion."
1,Ultraviolet Sucks/ The movie is one of the greatest made,"Im sad to see the harry potter series come to an end, it is without a doubt one of the best movie series to come out in my lifetime, and one I have really enjoyed. That said the 1 star review is because of the ultraviolet digital copy. Hollywood is without a doubt the most greedy arrogant pieces of work I have ever seen to shove this pile of steaming poop on people that have itunes libraries of legitimate digital copies that dont expire after 3 years is amazing to me. Ultraviolet makes me to coin a phrase from another reviewer here ultraviolent towards the movie studios. The fact that it does not work on ios devices worth a crap is utterly the most stupid move they have ever done. To say to 250 million ios users you dont matter is an amazing display of stupidity!! I will never buy and ultraviolet disc again. I dont care what movie it is i will pull it off satelite from now on when it airs."
3,Disappointing,I just watched the movie and am disappointed in it. I would like to have seen more focus on the wider cast of characters including Ron and Hermione. The battle between Harry and Voldemort at the end of the movie was disappointing. It could have been any futuristic movie battle in any movie. The rewrite was poorly done. Part 1 was better.
1,"The Digital Copy is a scam, UltraViolet sucks","Do not buy this copy of Harry Potter, the digital copy is a scam to get you to install a bunch of crappy software. Buy the version without a digital copy.Warner Bros, please give it to us through iTunes."
1,Ultraviolet sucks!!!!!!,"This review is for the digital copy. What a joke! I had to log in twice for flixster and then for ultraviolet. I was so disgusted I uninstalled the program from my computer (who knows how I can view it on my iPad or iPod). There's also an opt-in for Warner Bros to gain access to my account (check whether you want 1 year or 6 hours or don't agree). If you don't agree, you can't move forward. Learned this the hard way and I was put into a loop. Seriously, this took me 30 minutes to figure it out and I'm not tech-stupid. I wish I had just bought the iTunes version for 5 dollars less. At least I can view it from my computer, my devices and with an HDMI cable, I can watch on my TV too. Sad, sad, sad. Should have listened to the reviews about the ultraviolet copy. Avoid at all cost. What a joke."
1,Don't be fooled NO didget copy,To say that this has a didget copy is a LIE. MISADVERTISNG. FRUAD. I recently purchased 3 WB movies and all 3 have the same issue. UltaViolet is an online cloud that allows you watch your moveis streaming. it is NO GOOD it is not a didget copy and it does NOT work with Itunes. i am returning all 3 movies with UV i have purchased and cancelling all preorders that have it. Boycott this new format. it is terrible.
1,UltraTerrible,UltraViolet is an absolutely terrible experience for users. Movie executives are clueless. I can't believe they went with something so convoluted. Dont waste your time.
2,Ultraviolet is a total rip,"I love this movie and the Blu-ray is great. I was looking forward to also adding this to the other HP films on my MacBook. Alas, not with the lame UV system. I will not buy another film without a real digital copy."
1,Ultraviolet stinks,"Movie was great, but WB's decision to use Ultraviolet only with no option to get your digital copy in I-tunes forces me to give it only 1 star. To emphasize, there is nothing wrong with the movie, it is a terrific movie, but I am rating the entire package here, so I give the film 10 stars, but the Ultraviolet Digital copy gets -9 stars leading to an overall one star rating."
1,Ultraviolet copy is worthless,"I have sent a dozen emails to customer service, along with wasting about 2 hours of time and still can't make the Ultraviolet copy work. Totally useless digital copy and they should abandon such a flawed technology. Waste of time and money."
3,Ultraviolet frustrating,"As with other reviewers, I have to agree. The move itself is fine. I'm just disappointed in the ultraviolet version. I hope the manufacturer takes concerns into consideration before continuing these types of ""digital"" releases."
3,UK DVD not compatible in US!,Don't be mislead by reviews telling you to buy the UK combo pack because the digital copy was better. The DVD does not work in U.S.!
1,"The 3d is very disapointing. Had so many chances for 3d pop out effect,and there isn't any. Good movie,but the 3d is not good .","The 3d is very disapointing, it's a good movie,but the 3d never leaves the out side of the screen, and has many chances to have some 3d pop out effects,but they never come."
5,not as bad as everyone says it is,the UV copy actually isn't as bad as everyone is says all you need to do is download the app from the app store and after you redeem the code you can watch it from your phone or ipod. they say it exactly in the FAQs on their website. I was going to contact them for the iTunes code someone else suggested but than I looked at the FAQs and saw how to get it onto my android device.
5,We love Harry Potter!,"Since we are big Harry Potter fans you can't expect a bad review from us! We enjoyed the movie and think they did a decent job with the ending. We would have liked to have seen more of the end battle with all the characters that were involved in the book, but it was good."
1,one disk blue ray only,"this is blue ray disc only. UltraViolet Digital Copy is not a copy that will play in a regular DVD player like the Digital Copy. amazon has blue ray disc with dvd disc for 5 dollars lessHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)witch is a much better gift and a better deal. i will be ordering it as a replacement gift and regrettably i will then have purchased both"
3,DVD watcher,"I love all of the Harry Potter books and movies. However, Deathly Hallows part 2 isn't much better than part 1, ONLY because Yates (the director) has filmed the movie so dark you can't see what's going on. Part 2 is a little better than part 1. I know Yates was going for ""mood"" but he and the crew failed miserably. How can you set the mood if you can't see what's going on? There is no excuse for filming a very good movie and turning it into an okay movie by filming it with no lights. It is VERY disappointing. I watch a movie so I can be entertained and SEE what's going. Also, not only is it so dark you can't see anything, the sound effects and music are so loud you can't hear what people are saying (which is how they do most movies now). I'm sorry, I want to SEE and HEAR what's going on in a movie!"
3,goodMy,My son really liked the Festivus/Christmas/Kwanza gift of the Harry Potter video ordered from the third party participant on the amamzon system.
4,Harry Potter 3D,This is a great series. Sad it came to an end. I wish I had seen most of the comments before I bought my copy. I bought it for $29.99 at Best Buy with the Ultraviolet Digital Copy which really sucks. It takes over 4 hours to download the so called digital copy to my computer. I'll have to be more careful in the future not to buy movies with the ultraviolet digital copy. Some ultraviolet digital copies I can't even download because I don't live within the 50 states. It's really unfair being that you pay for the full product and can't even get what you pay for. From now on I want the actual digital copy.
4,"great movie, wish the photography director would ""lighten up""","What is the deal with the darkness? Half blood prince was like this as well... far too many scenes where it's just murky and dim to the point where it detracts from the mood. Wish they would have hired Guillermo Navarro instead of Eduardo Serra. Great movie though, and some genuine surprises if you haven't read the books [like anyone hasn't, haha]."
1,UltraViolet is terrible,The UltraViolet digital copy is a complete rip-off and waste of time. The app is buggy and forces you to install it on all of your iOS devices to watch something that should be integrated with iTunes. WB should fire the marketing guys in charge of coming up with this UltraViolet mess.
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I purchased this item because I didn't need or want the DVD or digital copies. Turns out that it has absolutely NO special features except if you count a few deleted scenes. It does not even have the special features from the first disc of the three disc combo. It is truly a MOVIE ONLY disc and at only 2 dollars cheaper than the three disc set is a poor value. I will have to purchase the three disc version and will give this one to a non videophile relative of mine,"
2,Ultraviolet: Ask WB for an iTunes code and they will send to you,Love the movie - this review is not about the movie...this review is about the product/package.I realized only upon delivery that this was the dreaded Ultraviolet and not the traditional Digital Copy that I could download to my computer/iTunes and load onto an iPad.Ultraviolet is really a disaster...everyone here is chiming in on that and they are correct...I read online that if you complain to WB/UV support by email they will send you an iTunes code. I did that and received the code in about one hour. For that I give them an extra star. I now have the move in iTunes and on my iPad.
1,Digital Copy Scam,"I am also very unhappy with this ultraviolet copy. I think it is a shameless lie to call it a digital copy, and people have a right to refunds.I don't really have much to add to what others have said. I just wanted to add another voice of disappointment in the hope that Warner Brothers takes notice.ALSO Deathly Hallows part 2 is freaking amazing and it is a shame that this movie was one of the firsts to be sold with ultraviolet. My only hope is that is turns out to be a good thing. Harry Potter is insanely popular and I imagine there will be many complaints about this, definitely more complaints than if Warner Brothers had chosen to do this with a film which was not as highly anticipated. Warner Brothers, please stop listen to the consumer, and stop marketing ultraviolet as a digital copy. It's dishonest and wrong."
1,"Great Movie, False Advertising about ""Digital Copy""","First off, the movie is great. My review is about the product. Every other Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy movie I've purchased has come with a code that allows me to import a digital copy of the movie into iTunes - including Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows. After looking up ""Ultraviolet"", it looks like all you get is access to a ""streamed"" version of the movie. In other words, I can't put it on my iPad and watch it on a trip. To watch the so-called ""digital copy"" you have to use an app and stream the movie from Flixster. So you have to have access to a fast enough internet connection to stream it. If you're on a trip and it's even possible to stream over 3G, you're going to pay for the data. The bottom line is that I'm sending this back as soon as it arrives (it's already shipped)."
1,Don't support Ultraviolet Digital Copy!!!,"The new Ultraviolet Digital Copy that some of the studios are pushing is garbage. It doesn't work with iTunes, you have to download their special software to play the movie, and if you use a iOS device you can't just put the digital copy on your iPhone/iPad. You have to stream it. If you want a true digital copy you'll have to go through iTunes and buy it yourself. Please don't support this new format by purchasing this version. Especially if you are an iTunes user."
1,Not a Review for the Movie,"I just got this movie today in the mail. I've been looking forward to seeing the last installment of Harry Potter and got the Blu-Ray and, as always, got the Digital Copy to go along with it. All I can say is, STAY AWAY FROM THE ULTRAVIOLET! Getting a digital copy movie used to be an easy and pleasant experience. I really liked the idea of expanding my digital and Blu-Ray library. Not anymore. The Ultraviolet process could not be more offensive and disgusting if they tried. This may be the last digital copy I purchase. I really have no words.Still haven't watched the movie yet as I've been messing around with this digital copy all night. Awful.Oh - and by the way, the Ultraviolet Digital Copy does NOT work with iTunes. So if you are purchasing this copy to use with iTunes, you are SOL!"
5,Just what I needed,"Just what I needed to complete my collection. Not disappointed with this ending at all, I just wish it didn't have to end."
5,WOOT WOOT!!!,MAN!!!!! I love the Harry Potter books and movies. They certainly live up to my expectations!! I hope that you are seriously considering this purchase!! You will not be dissapointed!
4,Blu-ray vs. DVD,"Would have loved it, if I could have found a good Wide-screen two disk DVD set. But, it seems that Blu-ray is Knocking DVD out. I liked the Movie, but, would have been nice to have had more of the xtra scenes/features, that I had on my Previous sets. Don't think I will be using the UltraViolet. Never used it before."
4,Gift for Potter fan,"Before the set came out I got this for my younger sister who is a huge fan and did not want to wait for the collection. I bought it on sale. If you can I would get the two final movies together, instead of just the last part alone."
4,"Good Movie, and Good 3d","I loved the movie. It was, by far, the best of the series. And the 3d was really good too. Of course, its still a 2d to 3d conversion, so its not the best. I give the film 5/5 and the 3d 4/5. Its worth buying, of course you will want to get it from Best Buy.Also, this movies 3d is MUCH better than part 1's 3d. I don't know what it was so bad. If I had to guess, the producers got part 2 ready for the theaters, taking time to make it the best it could be, and then rushed part 1 just to make money on bluray release."
3,The book was much better,"I enjoyed the movie but I had read the book. A person who hadn't, watched the DVD with me and was lost sometimes. I had to explain that the dragon which the 3 used to escape from the bank, was blind. Also, at the end of the book Harry tells Voldemort that love is what he is missing and what allowed Harry to survive everything. Voldemort never wavers. Missing from the movie. I thought that the movie was overdone using black, gray, and white most of the time. Ditto with the darkness at night in the battle scenes. A little would have been enough to set the tone and it was the unusual objects that we could see that fascinated us in the prior stories. Grawp fights the Death Eaters but is not mentioned in the film even when he is shown.By reading the book first, I knew what was happening and what was about to happen. Without that insight I would have rated the movie a 2."
1,UltraViolet Digital Copy Does not work with iTunes!,"Recently purchased this copy with the Digital copy included. They now have something called Ultraviolet Digital copy. This will ONLY work with Flixster and you have to download Adobe apps to run this!! What a joke! It will only work with a WiFi connection and not in itunes! What is the point??? The main reason I purchase these digital downloads is so that I can watch movies on plane flights. This is now not possible! Flixster is aware of this, will do nothing, and there is no itunes option. STAY AWAY FROM ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL DOWNLOADS!"
1,"Movie ok, Ultraviolet Digital Copy bad","I've always trusted Amazon to do the right choice for me. Not anymore. When choosing this movie, I could have selected the blu-ray only format, and that would have been ok. I chose the blu-ray + dvd + digital copy instead. Now I realize this digital copy is unusable for me, I won't be able to put in in my carefully built iTunes library, contrary to what I've done with all my previous purchases... Now I realize I'll have to be careful when choosing digital copies, as now there are more options that I don't really care about. Yes, I know I should be the one doing the research before buying, but it is a case of innocence lost. Stay away from this Ultraviolet digital version."
5,Harry Potter #7 Part2 Fabulous,"This movie is one of the best of its kind ever, right up there with Academy Award winner the Lord of the Rings Part 3 - Return of the King. What a joy to now own it! It's spectacular...."
3,Great movie...Bad UltraViolet,"I knew this movie had an UltraViolet Digitally Streaming Copy, but I didn't care because I wanted the DVD for my collection. I also know how to convert the DVD into my own digital copy which WILL play anywhere. 5 stars because the movie is awesome, but subtract 2 stars for the UltraViolet copy. Also, I hate these new, flimsy, ""eco"" DVD cases. Bring back the old, sturdy DVD cases."
1,Harry Potter and Ultraviolet,"Ultraviolet and Flixster both suck. Attempting to create an ultraviolet account and then linking the movie to it, well I've seen buggier programming, I just don't remember when. With Ultraviolet you can't tell if you've been successful or not. When you log in, it takes you to your account page. Now, you have a problem because when you attempt to leave this page, it wants you to update your info including changing your password which you did last time you were stuck on this page. It just stubbornly refuses to let you leave gracefully, but tries to trap you in an endless loop. Flixster gets to the part about having you log into your ultraviolet account to link the movie and then once you do, it just locks up on an empty box and refuses to let you continue. And you have to have Flixster to link the movie to ultraviolet. Terrible, just absolutely terrible! The only good news is that the movie was fine."
3,Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy,"This is one of my favorites of the Harry Potter films, but this review is not for the movie. This is for specifically the Movie-Only + UltraViolet Digital Copy.Previously when I have purchased Blu-Ray discs with a digital copy included, it is for a download of the movie, which I can then load onto my iPod or watch from my computer. This digital copy was for a copy of the movie in Flixster.You have to join Flixster, then you can add the digital copy to your account, then you can stream it from wherever you can log in to Flixster. I suppose this might be useful for someone who is bad at backing up their files, but I actually wanted to be able to download the movie and put the file on my iPod, and also back it up with the rest of my movies and music."
1,1 star for Ulta-Violet!,"Ill boycott the ultra-violet. not digital copy!! why do we have to buy the real digital copy thru itunes, when you are paying for this item that says it has ""one"".itunes DC > Ultra-Violet^100 , ultra-violet = rubbish, ultra-violet=not dc."
1,Ultraviolet will make you Ultraviolent,"Do yourself and all of us a favor. Don't buy anything with Ultraviolet on it. Don't do it. This service is a complete joke, I am not even kidding when I say there is not one part of this whole process that works as advertised. I actually had my digital copy downloaded to my phone for one day, then POOF. Gone. And so far I've had zero luck getting it back. Who do you go to with problems? Ultraviolet? Warner? Flixter? Well I've tried them all and still have a service that doesn't work, and a ""digital copy"" that I PAID for still MIA.As for this movie? 5 Stars."
1,"Great Movie, Terrible Digital Copy","First of all, this was a phenomenal movie. This review is for the Ultraviolet digital copy. Why are we taking a step backwards? The whole idea behind getting a digital copy is that you own it and can watch it in places without internet access like an airplane on your portable device. Why do we have to stream a video we've supposedly purchased the rights to own? Sorry WB. It's too late for backsies on this one!"
3,"Movie good, Ultra Violet bad","The movie is fantastic, but I am so disappointed by the ""digital copy."" I loved that studios were providing a real itunes digital copy, even got one with Harry Potter 7.1, and I love it. But what is this UV crap? Streaming? Sign up for two accounts just to use it? Cannot download it to iTunes? Requires a specific app to watch on my iPad? Thank goodness there are ways to transfer DVDs to iPads. I never minded paying the extra premium to have the movie studio provide it for me, legally. Sorry WB, but you really screwed up with this one.Update: Went to Flixster's website and submitted a feedback/contact message asking for an iTunes redemption code, they sent one back to me about an hour later! That makes me happy."
1,UltraViolet needs to provide refunds!,The economy is tough enough without companies like this giving false advertisment. I logged into the ultraviolet website and watched the cartoon about their membership and I could feel my brain crying but I kept on. When I log in with my new account I kept looking for the redeem coupon option but there is none as log as I am logged in. This is a terrible scam!
1,Ultra Violet is a joke,"I really enjoy the movie I would probably give it at least 4 stars. But the ""digital copy"" is nothing more than a streaming service and it is not compatible with iTunes. I would not buy the combo pack, just get the movie and then go to iTunes and purchase a real digital copy."
1,Ultraviolet digital copy SUCKS,"Really , REALLY you're going to push some crappy new digital copy SERVICE on me. No thanks, I will never buy a movie that has ""ultraviolet digital copy"" again. Boooooo"
1,UltraViolet is TERRIBLE!!,"Ok, when I originally ordered this the description just said ""Digital Copy"" which has always equated to iTunes compatible and more importantly a true copy you could download to a device and take with you wherever you went, like say an airplane. No, no, no...UltraViolet is Ultra annoying and impractical. Honestly, you can use it on your mobile phone but only if you are connected to WiFi...if I were at home I would watch on my TV.This is nothing but a deceptive business practice being used by WB to try and lock in people to a service that doesn't really work. These people jsut don't get their consumers and more importantly don't care!Horribly disappointed with this purchase...if I had know they would drop the ball on this when I originally ordered I would have just purchased via iTunes.Save the couple bucks and just buy the standard 3D version if you want the discs."
1,"Great movie, but don't buy this for the digital copy! The Ultraviolet digital copy sucks!","The 1-star review is not for the movie itself. The movie is fantastic. The low rating is for the stupid Ultraviolet digital copy. It makes you sign register a new account with them, but it's not a REAL digital copy. And you CANNOT upload it to your iTunes. And for those with iPhones & iPads, forget it. It's lame. I wish I had read the other reviews before I went through the Ultraviolet process. What a rip-off!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! UltraViolet ""digital"" copy is anything but a real digital copy. Boycott this format. I dealt with this disaster with the Green Lantern movie and people should avoid anything related to UltraViolet. The movie was great btw."
1,Digital Copy is a FRAUD!,"This movie is awesome, but don't waste your money with the combo pack. The digital copy isn't really a digital copy at all. It doesn't work with any devices unless you download their specific software which is a pain! It is false advertising in my opinion, because digital copy has become synonamous with iTunes or Windows Media Player. This works with NEITHER!"
1,the digital copy is worthless.,The movie is great. I love Harry Potter but the digital version won't play on any I-pod or I-phone. Since this makes up the lion share of portable devices out the it makes it completely worthless.
3,That is it?,Loved it even though it does tend to drag on and on and on like the energizer bunny. All this hype and flare and we get to the end and I was like THAT'S IT??? I personally think the ending sucked but usually most endings do but this one is really bad.
1,Bogus,"Now that I have purchased the seventh movie, thinking I would be adding a digital copy to my iTunes library...just to find the pre-requisite of creating and ""enjoying"" a new account with Flixter as being the only way to get the digital copy...BOGUS!"
1,Hate Ultraviolet,Warner Bros needs to ditch Ultra Violet and go back to offering iTunes for digital copy. The movie itself is great.
1,ULTRA VIOLET SUCKS,"A new way to squeeze money from consumers. Another membership to maintain and you don't own the digital copy. Scam, scam, scam."
4,Well made but a little unsatisfying,"Well enough made but kind of unsatisfying.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1managed to rise above the weaknesses of the final book and make one of my favorite Potter films from my least favorite portion of the books. Deathly Hallows - Part 2 must focus more on plot than character in order to wrap things up and suffers as a result. Still, quite an achievement."
4,harry potter and the deathly hallows pt.2,we found pt. 2 to be much better than pt.1. the first video was very dark and hard to see the 2nd one lighten things up and made it much more enjoyable
1,UltraViolet should be a crime,Its sad that a space reserved for reviews of a fantastic movie instead gets taken over by complaints about the crime that is Ultraviolet Digital Copy. UVDC is totally unacceptable. Warner Brothers should really offer customers some sort of recourse. It really should't be difficult. You buy a personal license when you buy a movie. You load the digital copy in iTunes. You then load the movie on your devices for personal use. That is the way it should be done. Its not difficult. Thanks so much for totally destroying whats supposed to be a very easy process. There is absolutely no excuse for UVDC.
1,Digital Copy is a scam,"This isn't a digital copy and is not at all usable in iTunes. You can't even buy this movie on iTunes, so this is the studio messing with the consumer but not letting you know it in advance. All the other movies have been available to be used in iTunes and on iTunes devices *except* this one. The packaging is a lie. I wish I could get a refund and just buy the movie alone. Don't waste your money."
1,Over-rated and over-hyped.,Yawn. Another overrated HP movie by hack director Yates. This one was even worst than Part 1. This is one of those movies that critics vastly over-rate and proves their opinion is worth. No one can explain why they think Harry Potter is a compelling character. He is boring and vapid.
5,Good movie,I really enjoyed the final movie to the Harry Potter series. It truly kept me on the edge of my seat till the end. Of course i loved it had a nice ending.
5,Wonderful,"We cannot go to the movies, so we buy them. This was a great flick. It was great make believe. I hope we hear from Harry's son."
4,action movie,"it was very good, but a little sad cause it is the last one. a must see for potter fans"
3,GREAT MOVIE - but not happy with digital copy!,"What's not to like about Harry Potter? This lived up to my expectations - but like everyone else, I'm extremely disappointed in the Ultraviolet 'digital copy' that isn't provided on a separate disk that I can load on my iPod/iPhone! But if you don't care about the digital copy - and your only concerned with how good is the final movie in the Harry Potter series - then you don't want to miss it! And rumor has it that the Harry Potter series movies will be vaulted at the end of the year - so get yours now while you can!"
5,Just amazing!!!,Let me tell you that this is was is to be called a movie!!!! on of the best movie that I've ever saw in my entire life!!!!! just wonderful!!! excellent saga!!! i will never forget all the moments I went to the theaters to see the new harry potter movie!!!! I'm gonna miss that!!!!!! amazing!! just awesome!!!!
3,NO 3d bluray DISC!!,"i bought this bluray around 1 month ago, i only get 3 discs inside. 1 bluray 2d disc, 1 special features disc and 1 DVD. how come i didn't get the bluray 3D discs???!!!!"
2,Amazing Movie,"The movie is amazing. Also the 3D works great. If you are going to buy this item, buy it at the Best Buy store. Best Buy has it for 25 dollars. Also the ultraviolet dvd sucks. Buy this at best buy."
2,Dissapointed,"I just rate it with no more than 3 stars because I didn't bought the item yet, I was going to do it, but muy deception is because is released the product only with dvd region 1, that's unfair biscuits! why doesn't WB sell its product set to other regions too?! then its they claim next time about piracy and copyrights violated in southamerica, of course if they are unwilling to sell us the original product with properly dvd zone/region. There you need to fix that failure please. That WB be fair with all HP fans!"
4,The Bad Guy is Dead! Long Live Harry Potter!,"The final episode of the Harry Potter series is quite dramatic, especially when Harry appears to be dead and it seems that Valdemort is the winner. However, we knew J. Rawlings wouldn't let it all end that way! Good books, pretty good movies."
4,Better than the book,"Honestly JKR kind of lost the plot the last 3 books, and the movies did a better job of telling the stories, but if you enjoy either, you won't go wrong with this."
5,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Blu-ray/DVD)","I purchased Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 to complete the receivers collection. I am sure the receiver will enjoy watching it."
3,I dont understand!!!,I got this at target today but the special features will not work on my computer and (whatever you call it)my dvd playing system it also wont play the disc with movie on the bottem. i want to see the special features it is the reason why i paid more for it!!! am i doing something wronge or is this thing just stupid!
3,Not a roaring end,"I've liked the Harry Potter series up to now, but haven't been in love with it. That said, I did enjoy the series and was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, I wasn't really impressed. Voldemort was built up to being such a powerful villain, but in this movie he seemed pretty weak and incompetent. The movie - and the book - try to build some suspense by having Dumbledore predict that Harry Potter will die, but then it takes an ""out"" in having Potter ""kind of die."" It didn't make much sense and seemed like a cheap trick in order to give audiences a cheap thrill. The other bad guys also seem like a bunch of mustache twirling goons, particularly when they start laughing at Potter's death. It just doesn't carry the gravitas that the finale of an epic should."
4,Why all the 1 star reviews?,"I just have one thing to say about all these 1 star reviews, why? I mean you're reviewing a movie not a technology. The story was a fitting conclusion to the book series. Was it a perfect screenplay? No it was not, but neither was the LOTR. I can understand mentioning in a review that you are unhappy with a format, I can't understand how you can make it the most important part of a movie review."
1,Great Movie - Digital Rip Off,Wow I got ripped off twice. I made the mistake of Buying the digital editions of this and the Green Lantern. The digital copy is an Adobe ripoff that will not play in ITunes or anything I. It also is not compatible with windows media or anything you could play on your TV.Another studio ripoff like the new online anti-piracy legislation which will allow the Corporations and the Government to monitor everything you do online.Boo Hiss Warner Brothers and all the rest of the 1%'s
1,UK version NOT region free!!!,"So I read all of your reviews and, because of all your suggestions, went to the Amazon.com UK site and ordered the set that SAID it was region free. And a month later I get it, and guess what? It won't play on my DVD player - I just keep getting a message on the screen that says ""wrong region."" Great. So it was a Christmas gift for the kids which didn't even arrive on time, and when it does, it doesn't work, and the price to ship back to the UK is the same as the cost of the set. Great, just great."
3,Parts 1 & 2--should have been only 1!,"But if it had been broken down in to 4 parts, you would have bought it, wouldn't you? And they know that. Yes, the book was long, but that's the book. (I thought that dragged on more than necessary as well, but I'm not the author!) For the sake of moving it along, parts 1 & 2 SHOULD have been combined. Let people complain that parts from the book were missed: THIS IS A MOVIE! So, move it. Hated part 1. Part 2 definitely better. They missed the chance to make 1 fantastic movie. Didn't miss the chance to make money, did they? Oh well, nothing to do about it now. We all knew we'd buy it!"
3,You Can Exchange UltraViolet Code for iTunes Code! :),"Yes, what everybody else has been saying. This movie is a masterpiece, but the UltraViolet Digital Copy is bad. I totally agree, and the new UltraViolet Digital Copy adds practically nothing new to the table. However, I will not give this a one out of five because the movie is a masterpiece and the customer service is good. So just read this next paragraph. Trust me, it works!1. Go to [...]2. Provide the information and (nicely) say you want an iTunes copy in exchange for your UltraViolet code.Wait until the next day. They'll provide you with an iTunes code via e-mail! I guarantee this works! I put the new iTunes code they gave me into iTunes to redeem, and now I have a copy of this movie in my iTunes Library."
1,Disappointed..... believed to have ordered Blue Ray,"The movie was good but, again, I was under the impression I ordered the Blue Ray..... guess I should have read more and not just depended on the picture."
5,Focus on Qualia,"I found this an excellent book, both in content and in writing style. His review of ideas about qualia is good, and his contributions on that subject important. I already believed that qualia are evolved entities (one of Cairns-Smith's main points), but after reading this book I have a clearer, sharper view of this. Little is said here about quantum effects as the source of consciousness, which is the right amount for me. If this book looks like something that might interest you, go for it."
5,Excellent All-Cotton Mattress Cover,"After searching extensively on the Internet, I was surprised to discover that there is only one 100% cotton (lining and fill) mattress cover, in, apparently, the world: This one. Luckily (since no others exist), the cover is very well made and comfortable."
5,It's Cotton!,"I searched everywhere for an all cotton mattress protector and this was the only one I could find. Luckily, even though there is no competition, the product is high quality. It is thick enough, it fits, it washes well. No bunching out of the clothes dryer after at least a dozen washes. I'd definitely recommend this mattress protector."
1,"False - This is a Mattress Cover, NOT A PAD","I was very disappointed after purchasing this to find that this is basically a mattress cover. It's two sheets sewn together with hardly a spec of cotton in between the layers. If you're expecting a ""pad"" with any sort of loft, look elsewhere."
5,Wonderful CD,"I bought this CD in Houston and was amazed. The songs truely edify God. I love the song ""Here I am"". It is a beautiful and reminds me of how much God wants a personal relationship with each of us. Excellent CD! When does the next one come out?"
2,This is not 0.024 wire,This is 0.023 wire. My machine slips with smaller wire and I bought it specifically because the description says 0.024. The product is labeled 0.023 and it measures the same.
4,LOST SONGS,"This is the tipically lost-song buy. It doesn't matter if you just got to buy the entire CD (or vinyl, just in case), because the stuff you need is that strange, wonderful and peculiar song you've never heard anywhere, anyplace (not even in the Internet, e-mule or so) for the last thirty years. God is amazonic!... at least this time. I'll enjoy it whatever the cost."
5,Worshipful music to the Lord,"I received this album back in 1998 on a cassette. I played it in my car for a long time until it became a bit obsolete. The songs on it spoke truths of the Bible to my heart and have lasted in my spirit for a long time. I recently had a nudging in my heart to see if I could find this album online. I needed to add a couple of songs to a CD I was making for a dear friend battling cancer and knew that the songs God was reminding me of, were on this album. I am very pleased to have found it and shared it with my friend. I pray they will minister comfort and maybe even healing - if the Lord so wills. God is so good and perfect in His timing. I certainly never would have thought He would use it like that."
3,"A good read but ... not everything one reads is ""meaningful""","The first Sebastien Japrisot I read was One Deadly Summer - a book that caused me to have too high expectations of The Sleeping-Car Murders. The Sleeping-Car Murders is best read as you would read any book by Agatha Christie, etc. etc. ... read as a book of the mystery genre the book is well plotted and has an excellent, surprising and realistic conclusion. However, the reader is unlikely to identify with the ""detective""; rather it is easier to identify with the young woman coming to Paris for the first time. And unlike One Deadly Summer, most of the characters are painted sufficiently well to carry the story but not so well that the reader particularly cares what happens to them.For a delightly, fun and casual read, I recommend the book."
2,Slow and unimaginative,"Seemed I just kept putting this book down out of boredom, and maybe that's why the plot seemed so confusing--it just wasn't interesting enough for me to follow. The concept was good (that's why I bought the book) & it's the frist Japrisot I've read, but it was lacking in suspense. In the end, the only interest I had in who committed the murder was so I could put the darned thing down for good."
5,pure demonic black/death metal !!,"It's unbelievable how many good bands are lurking in the deep underground. This was my 1st introduction to the band I never knew anything about and it blew me away ! This is very original old school sounding black/death/thrash metal yet it's very fresh to the ear. With songs like ""vomit the earth"" and ""blackened arts"" you just own it to yourself to pick up this overlooked masterpiece !!"
3,Mushroom Flavored Dark Soy Sauce,This soy sauce has a very strong unexpected flavor. You will ruin a dish quickly by using to much sauce at one time.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I gather this author makes a career of being a ""debunker"" of sorts. Little does he know that he's missing the point of the Potter series in many, many ways.However, if one is trying to interest a child/teen in science, and that child already loves Harry Potter, this book may be helpful.Just steer clear of the section on ""The Origins of Witchcraft."" It's poorly thought out, badly researched, contains misinformation, and is proof of the adage that one can't see what one isn't looking at. This author isn't looking. He should have stuck to the science stuff and left the rest of it alone.If your kid hates science and loves Harry Potter, I give it five stars because of its potential to interest a child in science. If you are looking for intelligent commentary on Harry Potter's ""world,"" I give it no stars. I'll average that out to three stars."
4,Ignore the writing style and enjoy the information,"This book does an amazing job introducing the ""magical"" world of science. I am amazed at the author`s research and discussion of emerging scientific fields--such as levitation and teleportation--in layman`s terms. Anyone with science or Harry Potter in his/her heart will love this book. Sit back and relax and enjoy the tid bits of information the author offers. However, if you expect the author to stay on topic, totally relate to the Harry Potter books, or draw any comprehensible conclusions...you will only frustrate yourself. Ignore the writing style and enjoy the wealth of information."
4,interesting,"OK - so you're a parent - and you know your kid(s) are completely under the Harry Potter spell. How do you use this Harry Potter obsession to maybe get them to learn some 'almost real' science (some of the science discussed in this book is very much in the realm of 'under research' - but a lot of it is associated with existing prototypes/applications - even if in a very limited form...)I think the concept of the book is original - it tries to leverage the natural curiousity of the vast majority of HP readers - and use it to convey some cutting-edge discoveries of science. Note that most kids will have a hard time understanding a lot of the science topics in this book - without the help of parents. Quantum physics, relativity, psychology of time etc. - are not exactly middle school subjects...Still - it is a good book for adults and children - who have a natural curiosity for all scientific things (and who are, obviously, HP fans)."
2,Not about Harry's Magic....,"I was disappointed with the subject and the content of this book. I was expecting to read about how magic can be like an exoteric branch in science. I wanted to read a scientific understanding of how magic can be like muggle science! Instead the book is full of explication on how ""muggle"" science is a magic in and of itself! While that can be interesting, it is not really pertient to Harry's magical world! This book centers on traditional science and is not about magic!But if you are looking for a book about muggle science as a ""magic"", then this book is okay."
2,confusing,"unless you have a degree in physics, i wouldn't recommend this book. i had a very hard time wrapping my mind around alot of the concepts. the book also has very little to do with harry potter and much more to do with all of the scientific advances out there that semi-resemble things from the books."
2,Review of The Science of Harry Potter,"Woah- This book was obviously very well researched and thought out. Whats-his-name went to a lot of effort to write this book. Though, as an obsessive 15 year old harry potter fan, it didn't make me happy! It took all the magic out of the books. it explained how every bit of magic the book had could be really happening, but with out magic! He took the all the fun out of it! When i bought it i thought it would tell me how the magic worked, not how it wasn't real. i was highly offended."
5,Why isn't this book still in print?,"After reading the books in this series, you'll never forget the smell of wet sneakers, and you'll secretly run off and buy yourself a chemistry set in the hope of something magical happening. I loved these books as a kid."
2,Just the facts - (more or less) from the back cover:,"Debi D'Angelo (Catherine Mary Stewart) is the young songwriter/musician who joins a rock group and dreams of making it big - until she wakes up to the price of success. Niles (Cameron Dye) is the charming & treacherous rock star who's out to steal her heart and her music. All his brother Harry (Steve Railsback) can do is hang around and pick up the pieces when he self-destructs. While her life looks exciting and glamorous on stage, behind the scenes Debi is fighting for her father's love and approval. At the same time she's fighting a losing battle against the drugs that are destroying her brother's life. Finally, her hope and courage find their way into her music - and into the hearts of the fans who love her. Features music by Bryan Adams."
1,Rogue River,This movie has the most depraved story line and the worst actors. I wish I could have seen some reviews before I rented this movie. I strongly recommend you don't waste your money and time watching this movie. This is the worst movie I have seen this year.....
3,"Pretty good, actually, in a disturbing way","Disturbing is the key word. In an early scene the girl cuts her hand and the woman sews the wound with a very large needle while the man holds the girl down. And then it gets worse. This flick is twist after twist after twist. But a lot of things aren't explained. However if I told you what those things are it would spoil it. Suffice it to say the body count rises. One creepy scene is where a, barely, living victim is tied down with a sack over his head and the woman feeds him a couple of pills, blue pills, as in THE little blue pills. Why? Like I said, there are twists. The last of which reveals itself in the closing seconds of the final scene. Yeah, disturbing is definitely the word. It would be five stars if I liked this kind of thing, four stars if it weren't for the holes in the plot, so it gets three."
2,"Poor video, not recomendable","This video is based in the Kyokushinkai enciclopedia of Matsui, from IKO1, and it has a few videos of kumite, championships and Mas Oyama 50's bullfight and training (about 5 minutes).Not Recomended."
4,Intricate work,This book is well written and the instructions are clear. I was looking for a specific pattern and it met my needs.The quilts can be personalized and there is additional useful information.I would not recommend this for a beginner. It assumes that you already know basic techniques. More advanced quilters will enjoy the different processes and applications.
5,Wow!,"This album is a pure hoot! It is all in Russian, but don't let that stop you if you don't understand the lingo. This is music for a Tarrentino movie that hasn't been made yet. Even song is a winner, with outstandingly great hooks, beats, and snorts. Definately too cool..."
4,Good CD from Russia,"A couple of years ago, I saw the video for the swine song and enjoyed it. even though I don't understand the language, it is a catchy little tune and roots in my brain. I forgot about the song until I heard it again in GTA. AFter finding out what the song was, I decided to get this CD. I'll have to say that I wasn't disappointed."
2,to tiny,This is very small I can't imagin anyone using it unless it was a backpacker or a soldier who was traveling light. It did not have anything in the photo to judge the size with it would be nice if they put in the gun so you could judge it better.
5,Good value,"Mainly seconding the other reviewer -- I, too, was worried about the supposed 37"" height, but trusted the review and indeed it did arrive at a normal dining-room-table height of roughly 29"". Looks good, feels solid, good buy."
2,couldn't use it,Doesn't work on a 64bit system and I don't believe it will work on a 32 bit but I haven't tried it on my 32 bit machine.
1,No Go,This software is really dated. Finally got it to work on Windows 7 but the graphics and displays are really bad.
4,Impossible Problem is Impossible,"Several thrillers follow the same path. The villain is not really a bad guy. In this book, our villain/hero Fade has done some bad things. He is a sympathetic character but he does kill people which is not socially acceptable even if there is good reason. As a result we watch his work with his old friend Matt Egan and his strange relationship with Karen Manning with interest. How can it end. We hope for a happy ending. Fade is a good guy even if he has tried to kill an evil government functionary.As I write this I am raising my grade to 4 stars because even if there can not be hoped for ending it is a fun read. It is my first Kyle Mills and I will read some more."
4,4 1/2 Stars,"I think Kyle Mills is at the top of his game with this novel. A suspenseful thriller laced with just the right amount of humor. I loved his earlier Beamon novels and this thriller rates right up there with them. Keep up the good work.From inside:""The media's no different than the government, Elise. Everyone has the impression that America is becoming the most danerous place in the world, but it isn't. In some ways, it's actually getting safer. But those twenty-four-hour news stations have to keep people glued to their sets so they can sell Pampers or SUV's or whatever. People who think they're in danger don't channel surf.""""Anyone who would give up liberty for safety deserves neither"" (Ben Franklin)Highly recommended."
2,What a bore,"I am a huge fan of Kyle Mills - usually.This thriller is anything but thrilling. The title comes from the main character in the book named Fade. He is a sad, dejected, somewhat scary main character.He is asked to ""help save his country"" after this same country basically left him for dead. Needless to say, he is more than a little mad.While this would have been an excellent storyline, the main character is so flawed - and the other characters so little in touch with these flaws that the whole thing just falls apart for me.Usually Mills writes explosive stuff. This one does not even get a mild flicker."
3,I've read better Kyle Mills,"It was OK. Not more than that. Don't blame Kyle. You can't win 'em all. The plot just missed the ""page turning""- mystique."
2,"Couldn't pick it up... This one will ""Fade"" from memory...","I've loved Kyle Mills work, especially the Mark Beamon series. Smoke Screen was a departure, but Fade is just bad. As we've seen with many authors -- have some success and the editor pays you less attention. Shame. Fade is poorly written with a story that is just contrived. Not up to Mills' earlier efforts. Won't be bad for a summer escapist piece, but if you're like me and crave a good read every time you invest in a book, then Fade will let you down. I finally had enough of the poor writing and gave up about 10 chapters in. Sorry, Kyle. You let us down."
2,Disappointing,"I really liked The Immortalist but didn't like much about the characters, or story, in this one. Shallow. Unbelievable. Numb."
4,FUN IN BORNEO,"I picked this book up while I was vacationing in Holland several years ago. I found it to be one of the funniest books I have ever read. It tells about two friends looking for the elusive albino rhino in Borneo. The first few pages were completely riotous - how they were getting ready for the rigors of jungle travel made me fall out of my chair from laughter. This book is written by a funny guy! It tells his own story, in his own words from his point of view. It is sincere, hilarious and sensitive. A very good story! If you do not want to laugh, do not read this book. If you want to experience some humor in life about a place the majority of us will never go, read it and enjoy! Lighten yourself up a little!"
3,Not his best book !,"Indeed, another reader stole my words: This is O'Hanlon's first, but not his best book. I too read the Orinoco book first, and found it fantastic. Edmond is crazy, and knows how to write about it. I fell for him head over heels. So imagine my disappointment and trying to chew myself through his trip to Borneo.... Luckily his third big book, about a trip to the heart of Africa, has the stroke of the master again. O'Hanlon, the last nutty professor !!"
4,Joseph Conrad meets Monty Python,"O'Hanlon's hillarity almost hides the fact that he is one hell of a writer. If you like Tim Cahill, you'll love anything by Redmond O'Hanlon"
1,Boring Book,"I had to read this for a class. I usually enjoy most readings assigned but this book was drab and dull. It read like the author was trying to write his version of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I didn't even finish the book, it was that bad. I later discovered that the author wrote this book years (perhaps decades?) after leaving Borneo. He wrote too many detailed things from random days and nights that any person would be hard pressed to remember. Not worth the time to reading when you think it's non-fiction. I highly question the validity of this being a truthful telling."
2,Not the best book to start with.,"If you have read Eric Hansen's ""Stranger in the Forest"" then there is a good chance that you will be disappointed with the condescending tone these authors adopt. If you haven't read Eric Hansen's ""Stranger in the Forest"" then go there first. If you just want to laugh at another culture and the experiences of two Brits exaggerating their hardships then read this. They are funny, but too often I found myself annoyed by their condescension."
3,postmodern writing is not about contrived closure,"If you're a McEwan fan then you must read this collection. If you're not, please read the novels first. These short stories do not offer comfortable closures, but they do examine some intriguing relationships in McEwan's usual keen observationalist style. These are fragments of people's lives. The plots hint at much but define little, therefore it has to be up to the reader to mull over the stories, just as one might mull over paintings. They invite us to consider human attributes that individuals might deny and suppress due to social mores, but that all of us may bear to greater or lesser degrees, simply because we are all human. I was absorbed by all of them except To And Fro which kept losing my attention."
2,Macabre redux,"There is little to recommend this slim volume of stories that reads very much like a reheating of the subtle horrors that had such an impact in Mcewan's debut collection, 'First Love, Last Rites'. Once again, the various characters slip, almost imperceptibly into a range of grand guignol predicaments, but the tone is less subtle than in the first collection and the book does not represent much in the way of originality or development from this early phase of Mcewan's early career."
2,Ho-hum,"This is a book of short stories written by Ian McEwan. In a sentence, this book wasn't very good. McEwan's style is engaging, but these stories are not very well-executed in my opinion.I think McEwan was trying to be original and shocking, and while there are many ""original"" ideas presented, the stories themselves are lacking and leave you with a feeling of cluelessness.As far as shocking goes, this isn't shocking. In fact, some of the ideas seem a little contrived, but I guess everyone starts from somewhere."
2,Dissapointing,"Lo compré con mucha ilusión en la versión en español. Una desilusión. Si bien lo venden como provocador no me pareció para nada. Lo sexual parece hasta artificial. No conmueve, no atrapa. Es la primera vez que me encuentro con algo de este autor que no me gusta casi nada."
3,It's OK if you only need 2 ports.,"I bought it to use with 3 computers. However Belkin does not sell a CHEAP all in one cable for this product. ...And by the time you use different cables, everything is REALLY messy. Also the worst problem is that it says it can support 4 computers, which it can, but you can only put on the sheath when you use only 2. I emailed Belkin and they said that they use the same casing for the 2 port as they do for the 4 port. So it really looks messy. The item itself works flawlessly, but I shelled out the extra bucks so the sheath would cover all the ugly cables. I don't reccommend this product unless you are going to use 2 ports, or you don't mind the messy cables without the sheath."
1,"Check them with the BBB, The have an F!","Ordered from this company and NEVER received the order. They claim is was delivered on a day I was home all day and refuse to resolve the issue. They do not respond to emails, calls etc. Ordering from this company is worst than gambling. You have a 99% chance of getting ripped off!"
3,text file in a bound book,"This refers to the GENERAL BOOKS edition. This is completely unedited. Words are missing spaces between them in some instances, numeric codes show up in the middle of sentences and ""|"" vertical lines are everywhere in the text. A twelve dollar book should be edited. There are a number of other problems, but they all result from what is obviously a text file printed as-is."
3,"Fluffy, fluffy, fluffy","It doesn't matter who wrote this nor how famous he is. This is pure fluff. His characters are shallow, the story hopelessly predictable, and very saccharine. I realize this may be more typical of the period in which he was writing, but I finished the book knowing I had gained nothing--not even a particularly entertaining time."
2,The interesting novel ykdykcykykululful ykxykxxykykykcyl ylxykxkhxgkxhklhclchlchl ykxgxkxjghkxgkhk ykdychkc,The book was nice but sometimes became boring. i m n b j k lh g fvf g j gigivjvjlv
5,People are weird,"This is a work of fiction - but I'm assuming it is somewhat representative of actual life in the time in which it's set. Loops and twists and turns, people changing their minds based on circumstances, making life-changing decisions seemingly on a whim...in other words, normal life! I really liked the ending.Well-formatted and easy to read."
4,Lewis writes great women characters,"The first chapter was so good, i knew i was in for a treat. That chapter is written almost entirely in Claire's head/thoughts. When i read Lewis' Main Street i was amazed at how perceptive he was of women's thinking in 1920. This book was written in 1919 and again i am amazed. He must have had good relationships with his women family members or friends, and good dscussions to be able to understand their thinking.This road trip gives us good detail on what it would have been like to try to drive across the country, especially the west, in 1916, few roads and those that there were were bad. He gives a wonderful perception of how being able to drive gave women a sense of freedom and power.I'm only a third of the way through and a lot of it is light and humurous, but it's a fun read."
5,pvc,Well written and in excellent taste. Kept me wondering how this was going to end. Nice wholsome story for many generations.
5,Nice Cover,"I like to keep all of my seasonal equipment covered dur the off season. This cover fits perfectly, is well constructed and is exactly what I wanted!"
5,It's a hit here at the Honda shop,"I just finished reading this book and the author did a great job. Avoiding the pitfalls of previous hop-up type books and those lengthy dissertations of machine shop procedures, makes the book more enjoyable. It's a hit up here at the Honda shop. I'm not editor, I'm a mechanic and Ancas spelled it out great. Its worth every penny."
3,Is mainly for older hondas,"Reading this book I found it to be for older hondas. The import shows today for the most part feature newer hondas. There is a lack of detail in some chapters of the book. An example would be the engine chapter. the book never outlines or explains what an aftermarket exhaust would do and how would that change compromise to getting more power. Thus, i will be waiting for the honda tuning book from turbo magazine in nov99"
5,Horse Power in a Book,"I bought this book late in october and have been enjoying it ever since.there is so many helpful chapters from intake systems to turbos. it helps people who want to drag race, street race, or even circuit racing. i lkie some of the specific information given like in the motor section where Mike gave listings of all the motors. that could be a great help in chosing the right one for a motor swap. after puchasing this book i have been able to squeeze out a few tenths of a second out of my honda on the drag strip. i have gained a few extra horse power after doing some of the things mentioned in the book. its almost like horse power in a book."
5,Very Helpful,"It wasn't as detailed as i thought it was going to be, but was a very good place to start!"
2,Titles misleading,"At first I thought this book was a step by step handbook on how to get the most out of your honda, but actually it just tells you the products that are out there for your honda. I would suggest not buying it unless you don't know absolutely nothing about the products out there for your honda."
3,Sportcompactcar,"I have a 94 gsr. This book is basically a hole lot of stories and reports form Sportcompactcar that someone put together to make a book. I did not find it helpful for me and my car. It mostly delt with civics. They don't go to much into detail with what they recommed using, what the parts actually do for you. Like I said it just a BIG magazine with no advertisement."
5,Great book for 1984-1999 Honda/Acura owners,"There is no better book for 1984-1999 Hondas and Acuras. If you have a newer car, I also just bought ANcas' new book (same title, second edition) which is in FULL COLOR and covers 1999-2005 cars, including a special section just for RSX and S2000. But if you have an older Honda or Acura, this is the book for you"
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. Much of the info I needed was missing. It was big let down. I felt warned off and talked down to. I want to race not be warned I could ruin my engine, I know that. I want to really make power not just bolt parts on."
2,What the hell happened?!,"Remember the time when Staind was full of rage and pain and tended to scream a lot? Those days look like they're over. The album was a big disappointment when you realize the almost instant progression from hard rock to teenage girl-friendly ballads. Don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed ""So Far Away"" as a single, but the entire cd seemed to be lacking the edge that made Staind so amazing in the beginning. I hope their newest album that comes out this month has a little more edge that the old school Staind fans are craving."
3,Staind Brown Cardigans,"This CD was some how misfiled in the metal racks of the music store. A mistake, you'd have to think. The heaviest that 14 Shades of Grey gets is in the first song ""Price To Play"" which curiously was the album's commercial single. Maybe that says something in itself - the heavy stuff is (or used to be) what brought the fans in the door for Staind, not the 3 Doors Down-style rock.Anyway, the album itself isn't a complete disaster. It hangs together with some reasonable melodies, but there's just a certain sameness, and slowness, that puts this release light years away from Staind's very good album, Dysfunction. Sure, bands mature and grow up, but that doesn't mean they have to put on the brown cardigans."
2,The Worst Staind Album Ever!,"This album is the worst. This is way unexpected from Staind, Every album has always been better than the previous one(i.e., Break the Cycle was better than Dysfunction, and so on.) This album does not have the same kick as the other three have. There are just two many slow songs(love songs), I have always liked Staind for their music; exciting and dimensional. But this album is not worth the money you might want to spend.I will only give this album 2 stars because it still does have about 2-3 songs that are good. The one song that i do think has the most kick is of course the new single, Price to Play. Almost everyone has heard this song and i wish the other songs would be just like this one."
2,Worst Staind album,"13 tracks from Staind and only 3 are any good, huge disappointment from a great band. Thank god Chapter V is a great album."
3,"If 2 and a 1/2 were an option, that's what I'd give it","As many times as I've attempted to fall in love with this album, there are still only about 5 songs that I find listenable. Most of this disc just feels uninspired. It lacks the catchiness we've all come to expect. Those 5 songs still make it worth owning though. And that's why I gave it a 3 instead of a 2. When Staind gets it right, they really get it right. And the good tracks here are no exception. I know (from reading reviews here) that a lot of people don't share my opinion where this album is concerned. But in all honesty I do not see what others see in it that makes it a 4 or a 5 star release. Maybe you will. But I have yet to. And it's not for lack of trying."
1,Track Listing is NOT accurate,"After reading the track listing listed by amazon I ordered this item from one of the sellers...I just recieved it and the track listing isn't anything AT ALL like what is listed by Amazon further searching on the web shows apparently Amazon just has it all wrong...Apparently the correct track listing for the CD is:1 Melissa Etheridge Bring Me Some Water2 Church, The Under The Milky Way3 Oleta Adams Rhythm Of Life4 Los Lobos Tears Of God5 Texas Future Is Promises6 Bruce Cockburn If I Had A Rocket Launcher7 Nits, The J.O.S. Days8 Michael Penn No Myth9 Scene, The (2) Rigoreus10 House Of Love, The Beatles And The Stones11 Bob Geldof Great Song Of Indifference12 Gavin Friday & Man Seezer, The* Apologia13 Deacon Blue Willin'14 Rory Block Lovin' Whiskey15 Fatal Flowers, The Tell Me That It Isn't True16 Michelle Shocked Anchorage17 Tanita Tikaram Little Sister Leaving Town18 Brian Kennedy Captured"
5,For the mathematician in all of us...!,"Well, maybe for SOME of us! The book presents a fascinating history of...counting. Simple, you say? You just start at 1 and keep going. This is true only since recent history. What led up to this ""modern"" math? Take a look!"
4,Solid Training DVD,"In the winter boredom phase of the cycling season I need something engaging to help with indoor training. In particuar I like having intervals timed for me and cadence spelled out. Instead of staring at my computer, zoning out, and losing track of time, the DVD helps me stay focused. The trainer shares healthy bits of cycling technique along the way - and in the case of this DVD - helps build skills and strength in pedal technique. The only thing that would make it better would be scenery or race footage instead of 5 people sweating on stationary trainers. For this one reason, I like Cycling Videos Online a bit better."
2,Another Imus shill job,"Let me start by saying I'm usually a sucker for father/son stories and I'm a big fan of Russert. However, if Don Imus had not shilled this book, it might not have sold a hundred copies. There is maybe enough good material in this book for a long essay. Let me save you some money:I grew up in Buffalo. My dad is a hard-working, salt-of-the-earth guy. He has given me some good advice over the years."
1,"American Journalism: It's the Celebrity, Stupid!","This isn't a book about Big Russ or life lessons. It's a book about a Big TV Star. Tim Russert. But because he calls himself a journalist, he disguises this autobiography as a biography about his dad, borrowing heavily from the ideas of NBC colleague Tom Brokaw's ""greatest generation"" story. Only Brokaw already did it. And like Brokaw before him, Russert has at his disposal, an enormous media network, including tv, cable, radio and countless friends in the world of newspapers and magazines at his disposal, to market the book. All around a good deal both for NBC and Tim Russert."
2,IT'S BAD & SAD THAT WRITING & PUBLISHING COMES TO THIS,"BEING A BIG FAN OF TIM RUSSERT, ABOUT HIS AGE, & HAVING BEEN BORN IN NEW YORK, I PICKED UP THIS BOOK WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS.UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S PRETTY BAD. IT'S NOT WRITTEN WELL, HAS NOTHING NEW TO SAY, IS RATHER BORING, & IS JUST A PERSONAL ODE TO HIS DAD - A SALTY, WWII VETERAN WITH STREET SMARTS. BUT, GIVE ME A BREAK TIM, AS GOOD A MAN AS HE IS, HE'S NO DIFFERENT THAN JUST ABOUT EVERY NEW YORK FATHER OF HIS TIME.THIS BOOK IS AS TRUE AN EXAMPLE AS YOU CAN GET THAT TO GET A BOOK PUBLISHED, IT'S NOT HOW GOOD YOU AND YOUR SUBJECT ARE, BUT RATHER WHO YOU ARE. I ASK ANYONE READING THIS REVIEW IF THEY THINK THEY WOULD GET A BOOK PUBLISHED THAT THEY WROTE ABOUT THEIR FATHER (WITH SIMILAR QUALITIES AS BIG RUSS)? I KNOW WELL THAT THE BOOK PUBLISHING INDUSTRY IS ALL ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE,LIKE ANY BUSINESS, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. HOWEVER, SHOULD WE NOT HAVE AT LEAST SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS?"
4,Circumstances do not dictate who you will be,"The American Dream is still alive! Results of your life depend on the beliefs in your heart, not the situations you have had to endure. Overcoming the negative situations with a positive attitude change the consequences of the negative actions. Big Russ demonstrated perseverance in the mundane of the difficult day to day; Tim Russert lived out his Father's perseverance which produced in him proven character and hope. The love of God truly flowed out of him to others. This book rings true of the ""Lessons of Life"" and how it can personally impact choices to change your future by honoring self-discipline, respecting others, and treasuring your country."
4,Tim Russert,"Read this after the passing of Tim Russert.... what a wonderful son and father he was. It is a wonderful tribute to his Dad, Big Russ, and fond memories for his family to cherish always."
3,big russ & me,"Simply written. Obviously, a story from the heart of the love & devotion of a son for his father by relating the years growing up in his family & neighborhood, of the lessons of life from those times that shaped & molded young Tim into a man of principle & purpose. Good read."
3,Buffalo native,"My husband and I were born and raised in Buffalo, New York and it was a very special place to be raised. There is something about this City that stays with you as ""home"" all of your life. Although, for the most part, we enjoyed Tim Russert's book because we admired him and it made us nostolgic, it had a wee too much of the ""Cleaver"" family to it. Also, he seems to pretty much discount his Mother in this idylic childhood and her influence on him, which must have been great. As his parents seperated down the road, not all could have been that wonderful. However, we still thought he was a true, hard-working, well-prepared journalist and not a celebrity interviewer as so many newscasters are."
2,Disappointing,"I expected something more interesting and insightful. Russert tells a few cute anecdotes about his Dad (who he calls Big Russ), but spends most of his time polishing his ""regular guy"" reputation."
1,"It is no ""Tuesdays With Morrie""","I was travelling on a long trip in the car and rented this book on tape. It is repetitive drivel about how great the author's generation and the one that came before him is. It is like listening to someone else's boring father talk about ""you kids today"" and ""when i was your age"". I returned the book after pushing myself through the first two CDs. I would only recommend it for people who need an ego boost and to reminisce about the ""good ole days"". Not for younger people looking for words of wisdom."
1,Big Russ And Me - Tim Russert,I enjoyed this book very much. My son borrowed it to take on his vacation last week and he liked it as well. It came in i timely fashion and was in excellent condition.
1,Big Russ and Me,Disappointed that I paid almost twice times the price of a book that is listed for $13.95
5,Our Sundays are ruined without Tim Russert,"I have never met this man of honor. The dramatic sound track of the symphonic music of ""Meet the Press"", his wit, intelligence, his tough questions -asked in such a gentle way- were always my companion every Sunday morning with a cup of coffee. I can't imagine Sundays without Tim Russert. I miss him so very much. My condolences to his family."
1,Lessons of (dis)loyalty???,"Mr. Russert, you've repeatedly appeared on the Imus show, droning on endlessly in promotion of your books, and making yourself a fortune in the process. You knew the deal with Imus of course, but since he steadfastly supported you, advancing your agenda and elevating your career, you apparently didn't mind.So where is Mr. Russert now, pray tell, with Imus on the ropes??? Has he stepped up to defend the man?? Hardly. I'm tempted to call Little Russ a spineless weasel, but that's a compliment only Imus can rightly bestow.I'll just think it. And tune out little russ."
2,Boring read...,"I was very disappointed with this book. The book is represented as a book about Russet's father, this was not the case. The book details the life of Tim Russet rather than his father. Although many references were made about his father is was not about him. I bought this book to learn about being in WWII and the ""greatest generation"", Big Russ' generation. If you are a Tim Russet fan and wish to learn more about him and his Democrat background this book is for you."
4,South Buffalo Idyll,"I loved this book, mostly because I grew up in Buffalo around the same time as Russert and all the little area references resonated the time and the place: Malecki's hot dogs,Sattler's,Loblaws,etc. However, I didn't feel that Russert was telling the whole story-nobody's life is that perfect. There is very little mention of his siblings and even less about his mother. He also glosses over his parent's divorce somewhat breezily.One more bone to pick:Russert seems to think that South Buffalo has the only Irish Catholics in the city-he calls one local pol a rarity: a North Buffalo Irish Catholic-not rare at all,Tim, visit St Margarets,St. Rose or St. Mark's the next time you're home. Overall a great book-a love song to Buffalo-why do we all love it so much? Go Bills!!!"
1,The Bills will never win a Super Bowl.........,"Russert likes to start his promotional interviews for Big Russ And Me, by recalling how the first two people to read this book were his father and his son. They should have been the last. I purchased this novel for my dad as a father's day gift. If he wants it, he will have to retrieve it from the garbage can i threw it in. Big Russ is an idiot. There is no virtue in working 95 hours a week for minimum wage, and drinking yourself into a stooper with the families paycheck. Mr. Russert(Big Tim) crossed a line for me when after President Reagans death he was appearing on CNN with Larry King, on one side of the screen they had Russert's head, on the other, mourners passing the Presidents casket under the capitol rotunda, beneath was the scroll.... Tim Russert: ""Big Russ and Me: Father & son...lessons on life"". Hey Tim I have a book for you to read......""Farenheit 451.....the temperature at which Big Russ and Me Burns"""
3,haven't read it yet but am giving it 3 stars as an option!!,...if 'Ryan from CT' had spelled stupor correctly it may have given more credence to his review of this book!
2,Disappointed,"The book ""Big Russ & Me"" was never received by my son. It was to be a Father's Day gift. The seller emailed me that she could not be responsible for the postal service. I stopped payment on my credit card and have received no further contact from the seller."
5,Surefire help for writers buried under an avalanche of doubt,"I've read most of the how-to books and magazines over the past 15 years, and this is the only one to inspire me to stop reading and start writing.The book lays out 10 basic rules for success, and helps new writers understand they are about to embark on an endeavor that's as much about the publishing business as it is creativity.Is it useful? Let me say this: It's right next to my keyboard as I'm developing my new novel proposal."
1,Incomplete product description,"This item was listed as a recommended accessory purchase when I was ordering an iPAQ 5555. When the product arrived, the package clearly states that it is for the iPAQ 3600 series. This information was not provided prior to purchase. The iPAQ 5555 has a recessed, spring-loaded stylus that is a different size and design. This product doesn't even come close to fitting. It may be a cheap purchase, but this is clearly outweighed by the hastle of returning it because it is for a different model PCC."
5,"Stylus for 3600, 3700 series","This is the stylus for the 3600 series: (3630, 3635, 3650, 3670) and 3700 Series (3760 and 3765). It is made by Belkin.The original HP stylus always work the best but are hard to find.The Belkins are the next best.The Fellows brand is next .All other brands are problematic.The main issue is size specification and ""heft"". Many brands are out of tolerace and will stick in the stylus hole or be too light for the inner spring to correctly eject them.Be careful when inserting the first time, if it starts to catch, stop and try another or the stylus may stick in the case.- [...]"
3,good addition to the Christmas collection,"I bought this because I was searching for a song we sang in elementary school choir, ""So My Sheep May Safely Graze."" This is the ONLY recording of the song I have been able to find, so I was very happy to have found it. Brought back many happy memories. Enjoyed listening to the other tracks as well."
1,This cd is wak,this cd is wak just like all the other albums that come out from down south and the west coast. yall need to keep it real and start takin some lessons from heads in nyc.
5,One Of Sweets' Best Efforts,"Harry ""Sweets"" Edison is a great trumpeter that is severely underrated in my opinion. He did some great work with Ben Webster, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Count Basie. ""Sweets"" is a fantastic recording with a great lineup:Barney Kessel (guitar)Ben Webster (tenor saxophone)Jimmy Rowles (piano)Joe Mondragon (bass)Alvin Stoller (drums)A great recording that anyone interested in Webster or Edison should definitely check out. Highly recommended."
4,Valuable Resource,"I strongly recommend this book to any writer (published or unpublished). It is a practical, no-nonsense guide. It is organized in a logical, easy-to-follow manner without much ""chatter"" by the author.As a side note though, this book can make writing seem like just business - which it is not for most writers. I would recommend complimenting this book with one that deals with the inner creative nature (like The Creative Fire by Clarissa Pinkola Estes). While the Toolkit focuses on creating a product to be sold (it's only negative point), The Creative Fire espouses creating because that is what the creative spirit within you longs for.It might also be helpful to see what novels the author of the Toolkit has written. If you wish to write something with more soul and universal truth, don't try to limit your creativity to what will or will not sell."
3,"An okay, basic book","Be advised that this is NOTThe Sell Your Novel Tool kit-- Elizabeth Lyon's book, despite the similarity in the titles. The latter is the better by far if you've already got a little experience under your belt."
2,"SLOW.... moves like melting snow, on a cold day.","At one time, perhaps when few were able to travel, this book would have been a gem. If you enjoy detailed descriptions, incredibly well written, you will enjoy this book. But for me, I will just continue to revere John Muir for the inspirational human he was!"
4,Could benefit from a forward or preface,"John Muir is a superlative writer and this book is about a place (the California Sierra Nevada) near and dear to my heart, so I enjoyed this book. However, I would have really liked to have had a forward or preface that gave more context to the writings, e.g. some short biographical data or background about John Muir's life and the relative time frame during which he wrote these essays. There is nothing of this nature; page 1 starts with Muir's words. In addition, he goes into sometimes excruciating detail about his experiences in the sierras, down to minutia about rock formations and such. If this isn't of particular interest to certain readers, I imagine some sections could drag for them."
4,It's where it all begun for TNG,"It's a good book, you get the chance to read what was going through some characters's minds but in this case, it is better just to watch the Episode. It's a classical... where it all begun."
4,Excellent introduction to the Next Generation characters.,"Although this story seemed, to the best of my memory, to conform very faithfully to the television episode that it was based on, still it seemed to do a better job of establishing characters than that episode did. Perhaps this is simply a function of the fact that I already know the characters now, as I read the book, whereas I didn't yet know them when I first saw the episode on television. But I don't think so; I believe that once again, this book demonstrates that a book can do a better job of character development than the screen can; the screen can give us visual impact that even the best written description can't, but a book will win when it comes to character development every time.Although I WILL admit that, had I not seen John Delancy's portrayal of Q, I might not have truly appreciated just how obnoxious he was merely from the book; his superciliousness seemed a bit understated."
3,Decent Book for a Weak Episode,"I remember watching ""Encounter at Farpoint"" when it first aired with several high school friends, and the great groans of derision we all uttered when Deanna cried out, ""I sense joy, Captain! Great joy!"" The rest of the premier episode was hardly encouraging. It wasn't *terrible*, but it did not inspire great hopes, either.David Gerrold took a generally weak episode and fleshed it out as best as anyone could do, but not even Shakespeare could have turned ""Encounter at Farpoint"" into a gripping read. There are, of course, a few problems with changed premises (for example, William ""call me Bill"" Riker and Picard's obsession with some woman named ""Celeste""), but one can hardly blame Gerrold for that."
4,Horray for Q !,Without Q Encounter at Farpoint would have been just a trip to another starbase. We owe John Q Delancy a debt of thanks. He made the episode and the book. Q's also good at keeping the crew of the Enterprise as well as Trekkies on their toes if not the edge of their seats
3,Novelization of the STTNG two part first episode.,"If you have seen the series, and have it memorized, then try this novelization that has more detail and gets inside the heads of the characters at the very beginning of STTNG."
1,"too broad ranging, tries too hard to make its points","Still on a quest to find good books for my newly bereaved children, I stumbled upon this 1990 well-meaning treastise that unfortunately feels like it's been written by a committee, with way too many topics trying to cover every possible death-related question from ""What is it like to die"" to ""How can you prepare yourself to die"" and everything in between including euthanasia, organ donation and the (alleged) Five Stages of Grief. Some of it is almost inadvertantly funny: ""Some people live wonderful short lives while others live long, miserable lives."" Yikes, what category does a 12-year guess she's in? Aside from its way-too-broad contents, there's the off-putting moral purpose of the book as described at the end: ""Learning what you can about death might motivate you to live a happier, more productive life."" Well, maybe. Or at least be more selective in my reading."
4,Training your mind to create using sexual energy.,"The Art of Sexual Magic by Margot Anand is a useful tool for those interested in Tantra. It takes some reading,discipline and a willingness to trust your intuition.Anand says that human sexuality has what we might call magical powers. I prefer to use the less subjective term ""transmutational"". The exchange of energy during sexual intercourse is not only so powerful that it can create another human being it can also be consciously used to create other things we want in life.Anand teaches couples to focus on their personal vision during sex, and create changes in their daily relationships and circumstances through the energy they produce.Anand believes that everyone can experience transformative power if the exercises in her book are diligently followed.I enjoyed this book but I must admit that years of reading and intuitive training has made me receptive to her ideas."
5,"Great book for mystics, spiritual people",Really cool book. !!!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!! !! !
4,Hilarious and helpful,"Just found this book and it's still current! This woman must have dated or known many a fine geek. Very cute and actually quite helpful in learning how to approach a partner who's more interested in online gaming than getting some fresh air (uh, that would be my Significant Other). I loved the tips on how to help your geek eat better, handle stress, etc. Recommended!!"
5,Captivating look at a Sometimes Tragic Life,"This is the second novel in the Josephine Trilogy; here the story takes us to the beginning of Josephine's marriage to Napoleon. We are witness to the horrid and formidable Bonaparte clan, In-laws that would make anyone think twice about marriage, and the rise of Napoleon's power. Through Sandra Gulland, Josephine brings us into her world as she deals with her new and ever evolving role in society. It is an interesting and refreshing point of view, which Gulland brings to the pages. We see history through human eyes and actually experience this period time. If the Napoleonic Wars are of interest to you, or you enjoy getting a sense of history and a different society I highly recommend this book. Gulland makes Josephine real to us, sometimes we want to shake her, and sometimes we want to congratulate her. Always we want to sympathize with her."
4,Tales of Passion Tales of Woe,"Historical novels are not my preference to read, but this was the selection of my book club and the local library did not have a copy, therefore I purchased the book."
4,my review,"In this second book in the series, Josephine has met and married Napoleone after being convinced by her good friends Barras and Therese. She is at first overwhelmed by the great love Napoleon is feeling for her, but soon learns to love him too. However, one sad thing is missing from her life: another child.The book closes when Bonaparte is declared first Director and they have to move to the Tuileries Palace.Once again this book is so entertaining and brings to us, readers, the whole history of the era and at the same time, knowing how it unfolds, we follow Josephine through her incredible historical journey.Wonderful book."
3,"Interesting, but different than the first","This second installment in the trilogy did not enchant me as much as the first. At times it almost seemed like this book was written by a different author than the first Josephine B. book. This book placed much more emphasis on the racy, sexy side of Rose/Josephine and at times it felt a little forced. It's as though the author felt the need to sex it up a bit. I found that kind of cheap. There was no passion....just the obligatory sex scenes over and over. Very predictable. However, I am still anxiously awaiting the third and final installment and hoping the author will revert to the winning style displayed in the first book."
4,well balanced,the historical background is accurate and leads the reader to experience the real way of life two hundred years ago (and be thankful you are not living in that period). I was a little disappointed to realize Jo's passion for her great husband didn't show up for a long while. which could have given the book more intensity...Let's see how it goes on in the third book!
4,Pretty good,I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It kept me interested and put Napolean in a whole new light for me. If you have an interest in French history this is a nice addition and a new perspective.
4,"Wonderful story, fraught with typos.","Such a charming book, but the frequent typos, misspellings and grammatical errors were so distracting (in the Kindle version at least)."
4,"Great Content, But Was It Edited?","I have very much enjoyed the content of this book. The story is fascinating, and it is a quick read. The drama of real life is much more captivating than fiction.The one thing that detracts from the story is the many errors, mostly spelling typos. While reading the first book in the series, I didn't notice any mistakes, but this book is riddled with them. The most glaring was in one of the dates at the beginning of a journal entry - 1978? I was born that year and I'm pretty sure Josephine wasn't still writing in her journal at that time.I'm not sure if this is a problem with the Kindle edition only or if it is something carried over from the hard copy.The writer is obviously very talented and prolific and deserves a better editor."
3,good book - SO MANY TYPOS,"When I pay for a kindle version of a book, especially $12.99, I expect that the same care in editing has gone in to the electronic copy as in to the hard cover copy. I've read the regular version and therefore I know that Aunt Desiree IS Aunt Desiree, not Aunt Deiree as she is referred to for a full page. I especially like when on page 30 Terese becomes Ther&232;se. There's a french name for you!I think for the third book I'll be buying it in hard cover."
5,EXCELLENT DRUM AN BASS ALBUM,This Cd should impress even the most pickiest customer and has amazing drum and bass and vocals.
1,Horrible shipment,"I received season 5 of Dallas that I ordered from Amazon.com. I paid the new price, but received a used one from another company. Not only did it look bad from the package, it skipped all throughout the episodes. The last disc would not even play. The disc was so scratched up that the dvd player could not read it. Of course Amazon.com will not replace it, because they had someone else ship it. Amazon.com found this person selling it, but will not make it right with the defective product."
4,A Gentle Story of Discovery,"The voyage of discovery is the theme of this graphic novel about a young English novelist who travels to the Swiss Alps in the 1920s to find out what happened to the brother he barely knew. The brother, a composer and pianist, was much older and died in an accident while staying at a grand hotel. In his search, the young man discovers love and has some minor adventures. It's nothing grand, but more of a gently told old-fashioned story of youth. The sleepy village and stolid villagers are beautifully rendered in razor thin black and white lines, as is the vast landscape."
2,no lid!,"The garbage cans are great but come with no lid, the lids they advertise (an additional $9.00) were way too small. Therefore went looking for the lids at the local Home Depot and found the the entire thing for less money and with it appropriate lid. When trying to return it, I have to pay for the shipping back and a 15% re-stocking fee. Not happy."
2,"Exhausting, Disjointed, Disappointing","I have an open mind & a very fertile, active imagination. None of that helped me understand Elena or her boss. Book I was mildy interesting, felt more like a hodgepodge of titillation than an actual developing story of a woman learning about her sexual needs. Book II was ridiculous; after allowing herself to be loaned out to all & sundry at her place of ""work"", Elena balks at being used to pay off her court-appointed psychiatrist's gambling debts? And this is a woman who chooses to remain the office ""in-Box"" after putting out to clients, coworkers, etc for over a year. Overall, a bit of a letdown for me."
3,"Book 1 fine, Book 2, not so much","I had high expectations for this, one of my first purchases of the genre. I liked book 1; hated book 2. Another reviewer said it might be too romantic for some tastes, I wholeheartedly agree. Plus the subplot between Tami and El never goes anywhere, which is annoying.I give it 3 stars because the first book was great. If they were separate, I'd give book 1 four or five stars and book 2 one or two stars. McKenna's writing is great, I just didn't care for the direction of the storyline."
2,Cardboard characters going through the motions,"This sterile narrative is about what people do, not what they feel. There is no depth, no emotion, no human response. It is fantasy, but fantasy fit for the lower half of the bell curve.The writer never bothers to enter the minds of the characters. He merely narrates action safely from afar, much as the director of a claymation film supervises his blobs of clay. One move follows another as his mannequins engage in sexual calisthenics, but never for a moment do we believe his characters are human.One reviewer suggests this is male erotica. Not so. It is non-erotica.Should one seek truly erotic writing, one might do worse than to try Anais Nin'sDelta of Venus."
3,Office Slave: Books I and II,The first book contained a lot of erotica and was very well written. The second on the other hand was a drawn out continuation that did not need to be written and was a waste of time.
5,"EROTIC,STIMULATING",MY WIFE AND I FOUND THIS TO BE AN EXCELLENT BOOK. GREAT STORY LINE THAT CARRIED THROUGHOUT THE BOOK.WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.SEXUALLY STIMULATING.EL FOUND A SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM SHE WAS IN AND ENJOYED PAYING BACK THE MONEY SHE HAD TAKEN FROM HER PLACE OF WORK.
4,If you're looking for Pilates...,"..this isn't the video for you! However if you want a peek at the kind of training Suhaila puts her dancers through then you'll feel like you're in a workshop with her. she puts you through the paces of her infamous glute isolations and then her tummy isolations that lead to forward and reverse undulations whilst propped up on your elbows will be quite a challenge! Be careful doing her muscle-burning series of endless tiny squats: she does these bent over, back parallel with legs in a ""straddle position"": I wasn't sure how safe that was for my knees. She also teaches rib slides and circles in the straddle position, which I find rather odd. The odd segue to an interview with her about post-partum body blues is a little weird but touching and the performances are typical of her work. No solos though, except in the dance circle at the end, which I liked. Mostly a good, challenging addition to a serious dancer's toolbox of drills."
1,Absolute Garbage,"Even putting aside the fact that it's ridiculously overpriced and doesn't come with the required cables (which you get to furnish yourself at extra cost), it is unusably slow.When switching between inputs, the video input switches after only a second, but it takes, on average, OVER TEN SECONDS before you can use the keyboard or mouse. Yes, 10 seconds of sitting there wiggling the mouse in frustration before the switch will actually let you use it.Without exaggeration, this is the single worst piece of hardware I have ever bought or used. Avoid at all costs"
1,"Bad product, bad support","There are 3 things you need to know before buying a KVM:1. In addition to the unit, you will have to buy a slew of expensive cables, many of which it is unlikely you already own.2. KVM switches as a peripheral in general are notorious for not working properly with any given set of machines/OS's/mice/KB/monitors/videocards.3. This is one of those units described in #2.4. Although Belkin officially supports Linux with this product, the customer support I rep I emailed wasnt even able to spell Linux correctly, much less help me get it working."
3,Not His Best,"This was my 14th Andrew N. Book because I think they are so fascinating, but this is my least favorite. Sorry, Andy. The Androgyne concept was a bit too far fetched, even for me, who adores weird, supernatural stories. I can't say anymore about the characters or the plot without giving away too much to those who may want to read it. Believe me, read some of his other good stuff before this."
5,Absolutely stunning!,"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already, so I can only say this: breathtaking! Both in scope, prose, imagination, and sheer audacity, this book leaves every other Sci -Fi book I've ever read in the DUST. Confusing? Yes. Hard to understand at times? Yes. Totally worth reading? Again--YES. ""The Fall of Hyperion"" is in every way a match for its forerunner, ""Hyperion"", and twice as satisfying. Definately a must-read."
2,A quick review,"Whereas Hyperion was a study in character development, this was a study in... unraveling a story?I can't really recommend reading this, but if you read Hyperion and are looking for answers, then go ahead. I can tell you that reading this will leave you with an unfilled feeling, sort of like drinking warm brackish water when you're thirsty."
3,"Good, but not as good as Hyperion","I loved Hyperion, but must admit that the second part of the story is not as good. It is a very different book and has to stand on it's own story more than Hyperion and it gets sort of long in the middle. I am glad I read it to get the rest of the story, and I will read Endymion after a brief break."
2,The Saga is Great; The Kindle Conversion Was Awful.,"Dan Simmons wrote this amazing saga as four books which all tie in together from Hyperion through Rise of Emdymion, and it is superb. Other reviews have rightly put it with the best of Sci-Fi literature, and I put it with the best of epic sagas ever written. I never wanted the stories to end. Awesome!The downside and a word of warning to those considering buying the e-versions. Reconsider it, and stick with the paper versions if you can. This is the worst conversion to an ebook I've seen yet. There are glaring errors of punctuation, grammar and, spelling throughout. They are almost constant, and kept pulling me out of the story. Kindle's version is very badly executed. In my frustration, I also tried another e-version through Apple, and it ended up being the same. Horrible mixups and errors throughout.Again, great book, great series of books, but avoid the Kindle version if possible!"
3,Not bad. Not good,"I really do enjoy the story but the imagery is abstract and lengthy. He throws in a lot of archaic descriptors that really do not add to the painting. At times the pace is frenetic and then at other times it's glacial. The first book was a much better read. The worst part is when he throws in the AI's koans (painful literary technique). It's very painful to dredge through pages and pages of that crud. Those are a lot of parts that are easy to skip over without really losing anything in the story except for one early round of koan's that had some pertinent info. The best parts are excellently depicted hand-to-hand and space combat scenes, travels thru bizarre worlds and the concepts of time/travel (I wish there was a glossary of terms)."
5,"Blown Away, Part 2",This is the second part of a truly wonderful and grippingstory. _Fall of Hyperion_ masterfully completes the storystarted in _Hyperion_. I was just captivated. This is amust read story. Trust me on this one also.
1,OMGWTFBBQ! Horrid,"If I could unread any book, it may well be this one. ""Hyperion"", book 1, was awesome. Book 2 fell apart with stupid endings and simple minded conclusions to book 1's complex ideology. Either the author needed cash ""right now"" for this book, or else all the drama, intrigue, and complexity of book 1 were just pure luck.DO NOT READ THIS SECOND BOOK IS YOU LIKED BOOK 1. That's my best advice I can give. Book 1 left me thinking hard. This tore down the curtain, showing the flames and voice of the wizard to be a small, petty thing."
2,"Not as Good as ""Hyperion""","This sequel to ""Hyperion"" does a good job of tying up the loose ends from ""Hyperion"" however without the Chaucerian conceit, it reads just like an adventure tale. That's not bad if that's what you're after, but I like my sci-fi to have a bit more meat on its bones.The world is still superb and even more worked out. The Shrike is even more in evidence and still cool.The resolution, however, is a bit too mamby pamby for me. Simmons tries to switch so many genres in the first book that in the second one he ends on too triumphant a note. Too long to go for such little emotional/intellectual payoff."
3,Don't bother reading if you haven't read the first...maybe not even then.,"I agree with other writers, you would not be able to follow this book if you hadn't read the first. There is just too much info about the characters detailed in the first book that you would loose only getting it from the second. That said, I'm not even too excited about this book. There are about a million plot lines happening at the same time and they come together so late in the game that it is difficult to keep track of them and you start to loose interest/patience. I gave it a 3 because about 75% of the plot lines were interesting enough to keep me going on their own and last handful of pages sealed the book nicely."
4,Second half of a two part series,"This is the second half of the first. If you have not read the first one (Hyperion) then you should. Reading this book without the first will be confusing (and a waste of your time). Would give this 5 stars except that I dont like books that are broken in two mostly for profit purposes. Still, reading both books was worth the money."
4,Great Book,"Bought as an ebook - love it!I don't know how this book would read if you haven't read the first one, so I would definitely suggest that first. If you are in to SciFi, I would give these a try for sure. I am now on to my third one.The books are all written exceptionally well, with just the right amount of detail and backstory to make you forget you are not actually living the book. The plot is so great! You can definitely use this as a book to enjoy for the read, or to ponder the deeper meanings of this book and its commentary about the society we live in today."
4,Sequel to confronting a monster,"Dan Simmons continues the story of the 7 pilgrims sent to confront a monster. The story broadens from the perspective of the pilgrims to humanity as a whole, and does it well. Although ""Fall of"" does not shine like the ""Hyperion"" precursor in sheer writing genius, the storyline carries the novel with more points of view, surprising nuances and technological deception. It also brings faith and religion into the story, giving a hope for the salvation of humanity against incredible forces and a surprising enemy.Again, the reader is left yearning for the conclusion, and running to purchase the next book in the series."
4,WOW,"This book is book 2 in an incredible series of four. The story draws you in and doesn't let got even after the book is done. If you like sci-fi or even if you just like a good book you should pick this up. But in order for it to make sense besure and pick up Hyperion first. Hyperion lays the ground work for the next three books.Although I think that The Rise of Endymion is the best in the series, all of the books are incredible storyies well worth the time to read. GO READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!"
2,Too Many Unanswered Questions,"This series has been invaded by strange creatures from another genre. This book (and it's predecessor) have many elements which are creepy and grotesque but don't have much in the way of explanation. For example, it's not clear why the shrike kills person X and not person Y. Or why the shrike is invincible in some scenes and vulnerable in others. Or why the ""cruciform"" is shaped like a cross. Or how the human sacrafice fits in to the big picture. In a science fiction book, everything should pretty much happen for a reason and fit together.I bought ""Fall of Hyperion"" hoping that these questions would get answered and tied together. I was disappointed."
1,Junk. Pure junk.,"Let's get things straight: I enjoyed Hyperion. It's an odd mixture of terrible & brilliant writing and I absolutely understand those that found the brilliance overwhelming & so gave it such rave reviews. On the other hand, this book is plain old terrible. Pure junk. The only connection with art is that it alludes to Keats. The SF ideas are not original, and the treatment of them is remarkably shallow. Naturally, an SF book from a good writer like Simmons, contains 10 times more originality and imagination than an average mainstream book. I guess that's why newcomers to SF, or people that like Star Trek, Power Rangers and the likes, might find no fault with this book. But for most SF readers, especially if you haven't gone totally gaga over Hyperion, don't make the effort. Really, you can compose a better sequel in your sleep."
2,Should have never been written,"This book should never have been written as the ending to Hyperion was perfect in my opinion. This story feels rushed and Simmons completely changed the writing style of Hyperion to force this book out. One piece of advice, read this really fast so you won't notice all the plot loopholes. The only reason that it is not a one star book is that the setting of Hyperion is impressive."
3,fall of hyperion,"I didn't like the concept of the omnicient cybrid watching over the event although he was a good vehicle for the story itself. Many of the concepts have been lifted from a short story by Asiomv called ""The Last Question."" The catholic church plays a major and triumphant role in the story. The religious developments are some of the most interesting aspects of the story. The fate of the CEO didn't fit with my experience of politicians or the events themselves really. All that said the writing is excellent and the book is immersive and a good read. You'll want to read Hyperion first."
2,A real let-down...,"I really liked the first book. I thought it was extremely original, literate, and well-written, with good atmosphere and a great aura of mystery. The second book, ""The Fall of Hyperion"", just seems so *ordinary* in contrast. I've read a hundred other books just like it, all equally forgettable. By the time I reached the last third of the book, I was already completely disinterested. Threw it in the trash when I was done. I won't be reading the next one, cause I just don't care. I'm not saying it's a terrible book... just terribly average."
2,Hyperion Fell,"Hyperion was an inventive, deep and delightful read. I was blown away by the scope, depth and detail of this universe, and by the subtle but powerful literary allusions strewn throughout the book (Hyperion's structure is lifted from the Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and the poetry of Keats infuses the book with soul).The Fall of Hyperion lacks all of these qualities, going instead for a pay-by-the-word space opera. Simmons did maintain the integrity of some of his characters, but it's apparent that he decided against doing the heavy lifting of evolving, transforming and revealing the hidden depths of those characters, something we know he can do by reading the original novel. Instead, he provides a perfectly readable, interestingly plotted but ultimately unfulfilling sequel to one of the best novels of the decade.Read Hyperion. Skip the Fall."
3,"Excellent book, Kindle conversion was poor","I'm not reviewing the book here, just the Kindle conversion. The book is excellent.Whatever process that was done to recently convert the book to Kindle has some glaring flaws. Typos are everywhere and the same typos occur time and time again.""...corn-log's navigational...""""...their drives off, their corns silenced...""""The corn-unit element of the...""""Corn"" should be ""com"", by the way.Every other page has a glaring and disruptive typo that distracts the reader. One or two typos a chapter is fine (even normal), but whoever did this conversion needed to double check the software's work. This book, in this form, should never have been released.Just want to say that I'm not some grammar fanatic either, but it just feels like shoddy work. This excellent book seems amateurish because of these problems.The sequel is the same."
5,"Not a fall at all, a big step up","The Fall of Hyperion is everything that Hyperion is not. Great. Exciting. Thoughtful. Much much better. Hyperion should have been 100 pages at the beginning of this book. We finally have our AI war, the end of the world and God. Everything I look for in a sci-fi novel. The characters that were so boring in Hyperion, really come alive in Fall. I couldn't put it down for my concern for them. Perhaps oddest of all, this is a sequel that surpasses the original. We'll see what the next installment is like. One word of warning, this book is 517 pages and a tiny font. This book is probably really about a 700 or 800 page book with a normal font."
4,"Diffrent from the first, but excellent","Hyperion and its sequel tell a story that is rich in detail and astounding in scope. Many complain that they are so very different and Simmons changes his style so drastically. While I cannot argue with the observation, I think the two books are very different and their goal is to tell very different stories. The first is an exploration of a small group of diverse characters learning about each other and the stange common threat that connects them, in a chaucer like group of short stories. The second, however, is a powerful adventure story about social evolution, science, and political intrigue.Different? Yes, but they compliment each other beautifully. If, like me, you were facinated by the universe Simmons created and the issues of how societies form that he explores, than I think you will enjoy reading this. Speaking only for myself, I cannot understand how any one who loved the first could dismiss the second, but you will have to find that out for yourself."
3,Almost as good as Hyperion,"Almost as good. Left my guessing as to where the story was headed. Had a few issues with the ending, but still a solid story."
2,OK but a bit convoluted,"Basically, it didn't flow very well. Elements worked and others felt contrived to fill space. In fact I felt like skipping over paragraphs in places which is something I rarely do."
5,Different writing style then Hyperion but great story,"People will often compare this follow up to Hyperion in a somewhat negative light. I found this to be just as enjoyable as the previous novel in fact I certainly wanted to know what was going to happen to our pilgrims ending the first book heading down into the valley of the glowing tombs singing ""off to see the wizard"". There were some parts of the book which dragged a bit but overall there was enough of a compelling plot to keep you very interested. I am quite the slow reader and became so engrossed in this story that I finished it in about a week and a half. Now it's off to Endymion I guess I'm hooked."
4,Necessary conclusion to Hyperion,Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion should be considered one book. I thoroughly enjoyed these novels and consider them in the top 100 of all Sci Fi novels.
3,"Good book, but too many of simmons prejudices show through","Above all I must admit that the novels are wonderfully written in most aspects are probably one the best series in this genre. BUT, I think it is immature and inappropriate for Simmons to start blasting cultures as he does in these series. I am, ofcourse, talking about his portrayal of Muslims in his series. I find it deeply offensive that a writer especially one who targets the sci-fi group of readers would allow such low prejudiced ideas into a series, which, in the end, have no real connection to real life. for that I have given this book a 3, as far as the general story though, it is a stunning example of sci-fi."
1,Print too small to read,I have 20/20 vision and I found it exceedingly difficult to read the miniscule print in the paperback edition....The font is so small my eyes hurt after a handful of pages.
3,Nice Illustrations but the Stories are too short...,"This book has a mystique about it, like a children's book out of fairy land. The illustrations are lovely and unusual but the stories themselves are not very engaging. There are twelve in total, and are little more than a paragraph each. Expanded upon, many of these could have been enchanting, here they feel unnecessarily truncated. We very much enjoyed Berger's other book, ""Thunder Bunny"" and this did not have the kind of Margaret Wise type prose that made ""Bunny"" such a hit. Both of my kids were bored by the story snippets, though they did enjoy the pictures. If you grew up reading this book, you will likely love it, but newcomers might want to look elsewhere first. Frankly, after all the positive reviews, we were disappointed."
5,"Signs,Syndromes and Eponyms : Our Legacy","This is a very valuable book for medical students, medical writers and doctors of all ages. I found this book easy to use, informative and very lucid. I congratulate the author for this effort."
1,BUYERS BEWARE- Coleman Poweremate is bankrupt!,Coleman Powermate is bankrupt. Don't expect warranty service or perhaps any ability to get parts until that is sorted out or someone buys them out. Funny how all these online companies continue to sell these items without letting you know that!
4,Heavy solid and nicely shaped,"Hard to find a 49mm tamper, this one was a good value and feels great in the hand. It is heavy, makes a good pack, and has a nice contour face."
2,Only ok,"Not a great tamper. The clear head was cracked! It is difficult to find a good tamper for a domestic espresso machine, and this isn't a good fit."
3,I guess I expected too much for this price point,"Overall, its just cheaper looking than I would've expected. The tamping base is sturdy and weighted, which is good, but the ""decorative"" top is just plain ugly and reminds me of an after-market gear shifter. If you're only interested in obtaining a utilitarian tamper this one may fit the bill; however I would argue that utilitarian could be done with a simpler, more appealing design."
3,Need Size,It would be nice if you had the size of it listed. It's kind of hard buying it with out knowing if it fits.
4,Works really well and doesn't look too bad.,"I read on surfers's forums that this Shiseido sun stick works great. It works very well and matched my super fair skin pretty well - my husband's slightly less fair skin, not so much. However, it seems to keep us from burning. It does rub off easily so you have to be careful to not touch your face much. I wish it was just a little more difficult to get off. I had to reapply many times. It did not work well for snorkeling. With the mask going on and off, the sun protection just rubbed right off. I got burned that day."
3,Questionable,"This book lists the La Scala Opera House as being in Venice, which is a big surprise since to the best of my knowledge it has never been moved out of Milan. Errors like this make me question the accuracy of other information in the book."
4,Brings Back Memories,I'm 18 and this CD brings back all the memories of when we were all growing up. I can just imagine being back in sixth grade and listening to these songs on the radio. The only reason I don't give this five stars is because it's missing its other companion CD (a 2 CD set).
3,"So many memories, but not the same","I love this cd. It brings back so many of my childhood memories. There is one problem though, this cd is not the same one I have. I ordered mine off the tv and it was a two disc set with many more songs. Unforunatley, I had lost disc two, then i found it and now it's gone again and I cant remember what all was on it. It's still a very good cd that everyone should have in their collection."
1,Awesome CD!,I don't currently have the C.D. and I am ordering it today. I have listened it to my friends house. I am 15 yrs old so if someone is looking for a gift it's a great idea. There are a lot of popualr and in my opinion good songs! What more is there to say?
2,"Great fit, bad bra",Wonderful fit but the second time I wore it the underwire came through the side. Total waste of money
2,Doesn't fit,This bra was awful. I don't know if the 40D was supposed to be in kids sizes or what. This thing wouldn't fit around my arm it was so small! I sent it back.
4,Comforable but not entirely supportive,These are great bras for the Value. Very comfortable and they breath well too.The only thing that kept me from the 5 start review is the shoulder straps. They keep loosening and therefor causing me to make mutiple adjustments all day.
3,"Maybe good yoga, but not for beginning bellydancers","I thought the yoga was ok, but the bellydance moves were not for beginners! Not too many beginners can do bellyrolls with no more instructions than she gives! But I did like watching her performance!"
2,disapointed,when i first get this ring is looked great. Then the citrine started to fade.It now looks like clear glass with a little color. I was heart broken.I will send it back.
3,Good Reading!!,"I was a little disappointed in reading this book, becuase the characters seemed so needy. Especially Martin and Carrie. Martin needed someone to stroke his ego and Carrie needed someone to love her. In other words, they were made for each other. However, I felt that the plot where two old friends who found each other after all those years and fell in love was very creative. This novel was interesting at times. Nevertheless, I was hoping for a little more adventure and spark. Better luck next time."
5,This book was a Hidden Blessing for me.,"Excellent book. I have only one question is there really a Jackson Gray out there. This novel kept my attention from the beginning to the end. It took going into a store seeing this book on the shelf,taking it home...and finishing it in a day in a half, to really make me get into the habit of reading again.I fell in love with this novel. Thanks for giving a sister hope.But most of all thanks for inspiring me to read again. Now I pick up book after book and just keep reading.Please let me know if you have any other Jackson Gray books available.Now I have a reading club going on at work. Every body is reading and sharing their Stories.Diane"
5,Exceptionally well written,"Highly recommend: simple enough for novice database users to understand without insulting our intelligence. Examples have strong relevance to real-life situations. ""Database-speak"" is gently integrated by this author whose mastery of the English language is exceptional. I found myself chuckling at his dry humor, which I could almost hear articulated with a British accent.Already ordered Inside Relational Databases by same authors."
5,Get up to speed fast,"Are you busy? If you time is limited and you only want to buy one book to go through entry level with Access, this is the one. How about going from nothing to putting together multi-table databases with average queries within a week. It took two days to digest the book and three days of practice. (I'm not a programmer either. I had Fortran and Basic 20 years ago, and have seldom used them.) The style is easy to read. The author's present only those pieces of information you need at entry level; shielding you from the mind numbing detail in the Access ""bibles"". The only derogatory comment would be that their example problems seem lacking, but that seemed a minor point compared to the clarity of the explanations."
5,Great Access book!,"After I started reading the humongous ""Special Edition: Using Access 2000"" Book by Que, I had to look for another book. That book was hard to follow and understand. After reading the good reviews for this book, ""Accessible Access 2000"", I decided to check it out. I am on Chapter 8 now, and so far, the book is very easy to follow and understand. If you have to buy one Access book, I highly recommend this one! You won't be disappointed!"
1,this book stinks!,this book is useless...I bought it along with two other Access books and immediately sent it back and of course A-.com ripped me off by refunding only 50% of the price...pathetic!
5,"Very well-written, clear, and helpful","James Luther Adams is not only a great teacher, but a good writer as well. He knew Tillich personally and taught for years at Harvard. This is a very helpful book as an introduction to Tillich's presuppositions and theololgy. Published in 1965, it is relevant today and would be great in Kindle edition, although I doubt that will ever occur."
5,great service,The type in this edition is so small that I have to use a magnifying glass to read it.
4,Guide for all members in the medical fields,"This pocket book is updated yearly. It contains current informations about the management of infectious diseases and antimicrobials. This book is easy to use if you have been adapt to its arrangement. Men who are engaged in medical service, whether or not you are specialists of infectious diseases, should get a book like this one."
3,An adequate treatment of the subject,"I found this to be a readable, thorough text that adequately covers the subject. A fair number of pages at the end are devoted to reference material -- dimension tables and tables of typical values for real-world motors -- which I found valuable. Criticisms include proofreading - several equations substitute the number ""12"" for ""I squared"" which made for a real headscratcher until I figured it out. The line drawings that illustrate the text were apparently supplied by Siemens as this company's name appears prominently on them. This seems parochial to me and should have been edited out, or other illustrations used. I thought that the treatment of phase relationships and rotating magnetic fields was less than rigorous, taking a phenomenological approach rather than an analytical one. It would appear that any material requiring a knowledge of trig and calculus had been stripped out, which is unfortunate. Still, not a bad text overall."
4,"Not All New, But Not Bad Either","Contrary to the information at some MBA chat sites, the questions in the two supplements, The Official Guide for GMAT Verbal Review and The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review, and the main volume, The Official Guide for GMAT Review, are largely carried over from the 10th edition and the PDFs of retired exams sold by MBA.com. So if you have the 10th, you won't get as much as you might hope from spending for the new main volume, or $17 a pop for the supplements. You will get what GMAT calls ""improved"" explanations. Improved? They do seem more detailed and better organized. These books are good study tools, just not as new as the GMAT folks would like us to believe."
3,Mostly 400-650 level test questions,"If you are shooting for 700+ GMAT score, this book will leave a lot wanting. The main problem is the questions are way too easy for those who are above average test takers. GMAT has become MUCH more difficult over the years, and this book provides questions from old exams which no longer reflects the type questions of the real GMAT.If you are scoring in the 500s, this book will help you. If you are already scoring above 600 in your practice exams, then I suggest you focus your studies on Manhattan GMAT books (3rd edition) and GMAT Prep (download free from MBA.COM), which has at least 250 GMAT questions which are similar to the real GMAT.Just as anything, how you spend your time is critical in studying for your GMAT. I suggest you use your valuable time studying materials which has more difficult and realistic questions than this book."
2,SLOW Shipping,While 5-13 business days is allowed for shippping this is the first time I have ever had a package take 13 days to ship. My order was not shipped until 8 days after I made the order. On the other hand the book was in good condition and the actual product was as promised.
1,Garbage,GMAT as a test (just like any other American test) is a trash. Stop wasting your time preparing for the test. You will be much better off learning real Algebra and Calculus and Statistics.
2,Just practice nothing else,The questions I thought were really basic atleast the first 100. There are only a few tricky ones. It might give a false sense of expertise in GMAT math. But if you are looking for just practice it gives the range of questions.
3,gmat quantitative review,"This book is just a copy of one part of ""The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition"". If you buy that then you shouldn't be buying this book. It is just a waste of money."
3,Belkin universal leather case for PDA,"No criticisms for the workmanship or quality of this product. It was much larger than expected, I have since purchased another case that was specific to my handheld device."
3,Usability,"The leather case itself, is of good material and workmanship. It's a bit much in terms of portability though. I didn't look at its dimensions close enough ere buying, and now I have a case that is too large to go into any normal shirt or pants pocket. And so is not easily carried with me, unless I want to carry it in my hand. And that's not the thought I had in mind when I purchased it. So now I'll be keeping an eye out for a case, approximately the same size as my PDA, that will provide protection from most elements, and will fit easily in my shirt or pants pocket."
3,comments,"you must offer a specific case for Z22, because the universal one is too large.thanks in advance"
2,Dissapointed.,"I was dissapointed to find that, eventhough the packaging has a window showing and saying this slim leather case had a belt clip, it doesn't have one.It really isn't that slim and I would say a little oversized for my Palm T/X, but I wanted one with a belt clip and this doesn't have it. At least the one that I received.I guess if you just want to protect you PDA and you are going to carry it in a purse or something similar, at least the price is right."
2,Belkin Universal Slim Leather Case review,"I bought one of this type, because there wasn't the one i wanted."
4,"The best, now that Ampad has given up the crown","I was using the Ampad 22-157 but then I ordered more and found they had moved production to Mexico with the result that the paper changed, becoming shiny and unpleasant to write on. These books are a good replacement, the paper is suitable for rollerball, pencil, ink pens and felt tip with little to no bleed through when writing on the back of a covered page. One area where they improve on Ampad is that the page numbers are printed clear and sharp. I'd like the wire binding to be heavier gauge and the covers to be heavier and not shiny but the paper is pretty good."
4,My eyes are less tired now,"I turned 40 last year and went from having perfect vision to experiencing eye strain and less than perfect vision. I was prescribed reading glasses, but found that my eyes were still tired. A friend who has similar problems started taking Bilberry supplements and experienced positive results so she suggested I do the same. After taking these supplements for several weeks, I have found that my eyes are less tired and my vision seems to have improved a little (clearer). I will have to see the results over a longer period of time, say over several months but I am pleased with the results so far."
2,expiration date,"This product expired two months after I received it, allowing me to use only around half of what I purchased."
5,Best glue gun I have used for the price. Hands down.,"Best glue gun I have used for the price. Hands down. Used it almost everyday for a month now, glue comes out quickly. It heats up to temp quickly, the cordless feature works great, glue stays hot long enough. Doesn't feel cheap in my hand. Its a good buy. I searched all over. There is nothing better that is cordless at this price. Next step would be to buy a $70 glue gun.I have used 10 different glue guns. This is better than all of them, including a lot of Surebonder models. Only one that is equivalent is Adtech Pro-90 which is not cordless. Most other glue guns have broken. Or leak glue everywhere."
3,"Nice, but . . .","I have used this KVM switch for a couple of months, and it has great features, especially the switching of mic and audio out. It does have one nasty habit, though. It will sometimes just forget what it is and what it's connected to. At these times, one of the connection lights will flash, but none of the four buttons to select any of the machines will work, and any machines booted during this period will not ""see"" the keyboard or mouse. I don't have a standard method for correcting the problem, but if you randomly unplug and replug various keyboard and mouse connectors, it will re-sync and continue to work until the next time. Note: This only happens when all four machines are not in use and then one or more are started up."
1,Absolutely awful,Followed the instructions to the letter. PCs would not work once connected and even worse stopped XP starting up - had to go back to restore point. Belkin email support is next to useless. I would strongely recommend buying a KVM product from another supplier.
2,Truly frustrating!,"Like a '54 XK120, this thing is beautifully styled, and utterly unreliable. It randomly loses connectivity to both my Intellimouse, and my MS USB keyboard. 30 - 90 secondes go by and then it reconnects, sometimes to redisconnect within seconds, sometimes it'll stay connected for half an hour at a time. Weirdly, it seems to maintain connectivity to the Monitor - though often as a generic display rather than as a flat panel Samsung. I used an IOGear two port KVM successfully until I got the third machine going, but I got sucked in by the style. my mistake! I give it 0 stars for performance, 4 stars for style, average, 2 stars."
4,reasonably priced trumpet bag,excellently priced very good quality came sooner than i thought it would very pleased and it is always a pleasant experience to shop on amazon
2,Not the best of this series,"I was extremely dissappointed by this book. The heroine was ridiculous and annoying. I loved Zane and felt he deserved someone better than an ungrateful, suspicious woman. Unfortunately, you'll have to read it to conclude the baby snatching mystery. (Wrapped up too neatly in my opinion.)"
4,Great little camcorder,"I got this camcorder at one of those sales that they have at convention centers across the United States. I had been looking to buy one for awhile but they were just too expensive. They had this one on sale for $149.99 so I thought ""that's a good price so I'll get it."" I did not recognize the briand name but decided to give it a try.I love it! The camera has given me no probelms and takes great pictures and records wonderfully. It came with everything except for the memory card I had to buy that separately.If you are looking for an inexpensive camcorder to record all of those precious and funny moments go with this one."
2,Catalogue d'oiseaux,"I listened to this with an open mind without any prior knowledge although I was fascinated to discover how to link birdsong with human music, well it doesn't and it is so slow and tedious I could not listen to one whole CD, never mind three."
3,"Lots of names, not a ton of info","The guy (a novelist he says) wrote this book like I would a grocery list. It was mostly a list of names with a few basic outlines. Also, not a lot of info on some subjects I thought were key. I was most interested in the Viking version of the end if days and this was covered in about half a page. The god Hel didn't even have a description. I'm ordering a few more books to try to fill in the gaps."
5,Nice,I was able to bend it to take the shape of my lights. Make my car look very expensive and nice (installed on a 2007 Honda CRV).
4,im high on life,"truly one of gthe great weird swedish hip hop statements. at the time infinite mass went overseas from sweden and recorded this album in la with mc ehit and qd3. they went alll out and bought the whole west coast mack daddy player gangsta image. this made the album very unswedish with the contrasts between the relatively calm hoods in stockholm compared to those like watts or compton. but what the hell, this album is hilarious, and has some dope beats every now and then too. most swedish rap groups never manage to sound this funky. congratulations infinite mass"
5,cynthia rylant fans!,"We love all of Cynthia Rylant's books and series of books, and The Lighthouse Family series is our new favorite! We are anxious to read the next book as soon as it comes out so we can know what happens to Pandora the cat, Seabold the dog and their three little mice children. Rylant uses wonderful words in her books, painting a beautiful story of words. (the illustrations in this book are beautiful too!) This is for a little older readers than her Mr. Putter and Tabby, Henry and Mudge, Poppleton, or Little Whistle series, ALL of which I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
3,Deep Red influence is obvious,"An entertaining giallo,this suffers a little from the large debt owed to Argento`s masterpiece.The romance between the engaging leads,the Goblinesque music,etc.I personally prefer Bido`s The Bloodstained Shadow(Giallo Collection),but this is by no means a dud.Leisurely paced,those willing to sit back and soak up the atmosphere will be rewarded.There are also some rather violent deaths in the film,including my favorite,set to classical music!Fans of 70`s gialli will want to add this to their collection."
4,good deck back,"Been using this deck bag for a few years now. No problems, keeps the waves out of your gear that you stow in it. It does not have a waterproof zip so its not submersion proof. To be honest I would not keep anything that cannot get wet in it. I mostly leave the zip open except in rough conditions so water gets in. If you want to keep a phone or something that should not get wet in the deck bag then you will need keep that in a separate waterproof container.I keep water bootle, GPS, sunscreen, waterproof camera, snacks and gloves in the deck bag. All stuff that can get wet but you want close at hand.No plans to change it."
2,OK if you never capsize,"I bought this deck bag several years ago because I got it for a good price, and I'm glad I didn't pay more. I was on a weekend expedition with a group of folks doing some sea kayaking and a woman on the trip had the same bag, she had just bought it, at full price. It was represented as being waterproof by the dealer. A wave caught her and she went over, and when she came up the bag was filled with water and she lost her cell phone and camera. It is really a splash bag, and if you carry anything of value you must put it in it's own drybag. I found the design a bit cumbersome too, a little awkward to get things in and out as the zipper doesn't go completely from one side to the other. I'm looking for a new bag, will probably go for one with a roll down closure like dry bags have. A $40-50 price tag is more appropriate for this bag."
2,"Show one, give another","I used to have the book that is shown in the advertisement. That is the one I wanted. They gave me the book with another cover. Yes, it does make a difference!"
2,"I tried, and I didn't get it!","This book is a description of a journey up the ladder of spirituality in the astral world according to ECK. ECK gets lots of praise from its authors, but when I put it to the test I can't truthfully differentiate it spiritually from simply eating food. Paul Twitchell introduces us to all of the different gods that control reality, and has extremely boring and pointless monologues from each. If I could do this soul traveling and experience this stuff for myself then I might find it more interesting, but the method of ECK of singing hue and staring at your third eye have only given me a headache."
1,Don't buy it,"After returning my first one after 6 months (the #3 port just stopped working) My second unit quit on me the other night (all ports stopped working). These things are not reliable. I bought an IO Gear, and it works GREAT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON BELKIN."
1,Dead on arrival,I spent several days researching which brand of KVM to purchase and decided to go with Belkin. I already had a two port KVM which worked fine. The new 4 port was delivered and I installed it. I could not get it to work so I called Belkin tech support. They are closed on weekends so I called them back on Monday. They said send it back and also informed me that I have to pay for shipping. They sent me a bad KVM and they want me to pay to ship back their defective KVM. I would never buy another Belkin product after this....!
4,Better than the linksys product,"I reviewed the linksys kvm compared to this one (I own both) and found the universality and ergonomics of the belkin product better (also the belkin product was less expensive). No trackball attachement problems as there were using the linksys (the linksys product dropped clicks, and sometimes failed to recognise the trackball at all), and the belkin product is laid out better in terms of how the cables attach to the unit."
2,Problems with modern mice,"I have this device and a 2-port Linksys. Frequently with this one, I get a delay in or totally lose my mouse control when switching between computers. I'm using a MS optical mouse that is natively USB, with a USB-to-PS2 converter attached that could be a problem. Just a warning to those with similar configurations that they may get similar results. The Linksys KVM has no problems with my setup."
3,Works Sometimes,"This KVM is very affordable and works great, most of the time. However, if you use a Logitech Mouse, do NOT buy this KVM. Your mouse will seriously mess up. This KVM is designed for use with Microsoft mice. I would frequently switch between Windows and Linux and this would confuse it greatly. Windows would forget what my keyboard repeat rates were and the mouse would move erratically for the first few seconds. Linux was even funnier and would frequently refuse to work until I restarted X-Windows using Ctrl-Alt-Backspace as trying to move the mouse at all would result in a plethora of random movements and mouse clicks. Of course, restarting X-Windows caused me to lose everything I had open. So if you have an Intellimouse, this should be fine, but if you use anything else, go with something else. Linksys, for instance, works great with Logitech."
2,not that great,"I had lots of problems with this KVM losing connection to my keyboard and mouse when switching between computers. The only way I was able to fix this was by using a converter that took the KB and Mouse PS/2 connections from the kvm cable and turned them into a single USB connection. $50 for two of these to fix a problem that shouldn't have been there in the first place. Cheaper than a new KVM I suppose.I also have a lot of trouble using the KVM keyboard shortcut in Windows 2000, causing me to have to reach across my desk to hit the button on the KVM to switch to another computer, rather annoying.It works fine with my monitor though, even at 1600x1200@85Hz, which is how it gets two stars instead of one.My recommendation is to avoid this product."
5,Dark and original fiction,"I'd heard about Danilo Kis recently, and read this collection on an airplane trip. These metaphysical and strange stories captivated me. Without having plot or character in the usual sense, they manage to achieve suspense. The title story gripped me and had one of those lyrical endings hard to find in short fiction- but several others (not all) were on this level, too. Have ordered more of this author."
3,For the Salt of the Sea,"This book was not what I expected. It is rife with great information about the rigging of ships, and is highly descriptive. This book is not for the novice ship builder or new ship modeler not intimately familiar with the structure of a sailing ship. The full ship plates showing all the rigging are very old-school and the size of the images makes it nearly impossible to interpret. Overall, the historical accuracy of the descriptive text is great, but if you are looking for a user-friendly book for illustrations on how to rig a ship or model you may need to look for other titles to compliment this text."
3,For the detailing buff,"Maybe more for the ship model builder than for the naval historian, unless you are planning to build a replica of a sailing vessel of the covered age as an experimental archeologist / historian.Anderson is rather thorough and the illustrations are very helpful as well. A list of related literature would have been welcome."
5,Sit back and have a cocktail with Cugi!!,"The cha cha, mambo, rhumba and bossa nova...ah, the old dances and great memories of the past for me. This is great music to pour a cold one or two (or more!!) and kick back and relax to.This is one swinging record...oh, I mean CD."
5,Love these picks!,"DentaPicks are so great for cleaning between teeth (even when they had braces on them) that my dental hygenist swears I must floss several times each day. The picks have no flavor but a mint taste could be nice. I've used these things for many years but am now having a difficult time finding them. If you can find them for sale, buy several containers; I know I will."
2,Big disappointment.,"John Fowles is a great writer. I consider The French Lieutenant's Woman and The Magus to be two of the best novels of the 20th Century. I've read both several times. But I just can't say the same of Daniel Martin.It started off so well, with it's scenes from the war. But then Daniel grew up and became a painfully self-absorbed creature. Daniel may represent Fowles' picture of late 20th Century man, but it's not mine. Because his portrayal rang so false, I found the book to be merely a well written slog through the angst of the 20th century (sorry--I should be ashamed of that last phrase).A noble effort, but false in the end. Worst of all, a lot of it is just plain boring.I continue to hope that Fowles will write another book that will capture my heart and mind like The French Lieutenant's Woman. (Sigh!)"
3,DROWNED IN WORDS,"I FIRST READ THIS OCT 1978, I AM NOW ALMOST 80. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ AND THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. IT TAKES MORE EDUCATION THAN I HAVE TO GET IT ALL. THE UPPER TO NOBLE CLASSES OF ENGLAND HAVE A LANGUAGE OF THEIR OWN, YOU HAVE TO BE BORN TO IT TO HANDLE IT. IT SURE DOES SAY IT ALL AND IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH HIM STOOKING GRAIN, AS I HAD DONE THAT AS AN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS YANK AT AGE 17 WORKING PARTIME FOR A FRIEND.[...]"
2,"Overwritten, dated, bloated, but reflects a certain zeitgeist","Daniel Martin runs through life, jobs and women with clumsy fecklessness, shredding the lives of those around him. If ever one needed to study how far male-female relationships and identity have progressed since the mid-1970s, reading this farraginous book would do it. Martin, adulterous, smug, opaque to himself, lost in a fog of alcohol, is a sort of man who thankfully no longer exists. The women in this novel would all have been more fortunate to have been born 40 years later, so as not to have to protect themselves through liaisons with this shabby character. An oppressive sensation held me throughout the book, a desire to excuse myself from the fustily chauvinistic world of Martin. Unless you are writing a book on how gender and power relations are represented in Fowles, avoid this pointlessly preening and overlong novel."
2,"Great writer, boring story","Loved The Magus. Kept waiting for this one to take off. Save for the one chapter on his first love - about three-quarters of the way through - I found little worth hanging onto. Great observations about L.A. and the film biz. Colorful descriptions of English countryside and the Nile Delta. But, sorry, none of it worth the 600+ page plod."
5,"A masterpiece, you will read it again and again.",This is one of the great 20th Century English novels. The descriptions of the countryside and customs left me breathless and feeling the heat of the sun and the glimmer of the grass. Fowles gives me hope that literature has not died.
4,A view from her student,"I am Mrs. Ciardullo's student, which means I know her. The book was fairly well done - I'd want to give it 5 stars, but the brilliance of Salvatore and Weis And Hickman and Tolkien rather dims the light of this book. I personally envisioned Rae as my teacher Mrs. Ciardullo. My favorite character is NOT Daro - I rather like Rae more than her partner. I'd prefer more of magic and such, but that's my opinion. After all, it is a well writen book for a high-school student. This can also be called as historical fiction, for no supernatural powers are seen in this book. It can actually happen, and that's what makes this book special. It has a sense of closeness and reality to you - unlike Hocus Pocus mages running around shooting goblins with their fire arrows from their fingertips."
2,Disappointing Cassette,"This cassette allegedly contained the title, ""You Belong To Me,"" hence my order. Upon its receipt I found such song omitted, and to obtain it I needed to purchase a CD of Stafford hits."
2,Fragile,Broke the first week I had them. I use a leather soft side case with some hard cardboard reinforment in my purse and haven't had a problem with other sunglasses.
2,Got a bad set or something,"I got them in the mail and there appeared to be some kind of cement or something on the arm of one. I scrubbed it off and ended up with scratches on the arm of the shades. Then of the two sets, i purchased, the other set lost a screw within the first 2-3 hrs and that was just taking them out of the box and looking at them. I know you get what you pay for but damn...The product doesnt get a 1 star rating because other than the cement stain and the lost screw they are reasonably priced shades and somewhat stylish."
4,"Recorded by chance,good on ""Glyn Johns""","""The groundhogs"" were suporting ""rolling stones"" at Leeds university in May 71,and glyn johns was set up waiting to record ""The stones gig"",and decided to press the record button and record this set by the ""groundhogs"" probobly while hanging round waiting,so glad he did.I bought this album in an Independant record shop in Newport ,S wales a few years back called ""diverse records""{still going strong}.Only5 tracks but a great feel for the full 36 mins 40 secs.""cherry red""kicks off,then ""garden""followed by a great live version of ""split part 1"",the drum rolls amazing.Then the exellent ""groundhog blues""and to end at 11 mins.25secs a rousing ""eccentric man"".I never somehow in the 70,s saw the band live which is a shame,and listening to this album shows me what I missed,A must for your collection."

3,wegmans alphabet soup,"As an adult I thought the dvd was really cute. My 2 year old grand daughter, who is fasinated by Sponge Bob, Dora, and loves dogs, was less interested. She already knows her alphabet at age two, so I am not sure that when she gets older it will hold her attention either. At two it couldn't hold her attention."
5,TOO BAD - DISCONTINUED ITEM,"I really like this light, I have bought three. It works very well, holding an 8 hr. charge, keeping OUR FLAG illuminated all thru the night.Too bad this product has been discontinued instead of developed further!"
1,Poor Quality,"The last thing I ever wnat to do is bash a product. This item is not what it appears to be. Maybe it's defective I don't know but, I'm not happy with this at all."
2,Fun till elephants.,"This game did not work on several systems. I was extremely happy when I got to FINALLY use it, yet when I got to the Elephant Level, it was virtually impossible to complete. I think I may get rid of it. This game is good when you have enough patience and time to complete each level."
2,Great game if you can get it to work,"Wouldn't work on two different systems with Pentium 4 2.8 GHz processors and 2GB DDR Ram, worked for about 30 minutes each time before completely freezing up on a system with a Core2Duo Pentium 3.0 GHz and 3GB DDR3 RAM. No help on the website of the manufacturer. It would be nice if the manufacturer (Pocketwatch Games) would put the specs for the system needed to run this game on their website. Until then, I would only get this system if you're a well-trained IT professional who can diagnose and fix complex software problems. I can't."
2,watch description,they didn't specify os good enough it doesn't work on my mothers mac wasted money it needs to specify that this is for older macs
1,Boring,"This game is very boring, and now I see why it was so cheap. I don't see how anyone can be entertained by something so unimaginative and monotonous."
3,stabila tape 30130,"tape is very accurate but is very flimsy, almost usless unless hooked onwhatever you are trying to measure, then the tape still is hard to keephooked. It is good for bump measureing like shoemold and base no good forcrown will drive you nuts."
5,You won't run out of new drinks to try for a long time :),"We have a lot of fun trying new drinks in this book. It has a handy index in the back if you want to find drinks with a certain ingredient (orange juice, tequila, etc.), which we use all the time. Cheers!"
5,Focus on War.,"The War of the ring is the game people really want, it's the game that FOCUSES on the war for the ring of power, and only focuses on that aspect alone.This game allows you to control the Allience or the Dark Armies.And you can attack the other army, it is the way tolkien meant it, raw. You can kill everyone and run your towns.This game is just like the Age of Empires Series but witht the added element of Tolkiens emagination.Overview:Fun- 10/10 A lot of fun to destoy the opposing forces.Gameplay- 10/10Graphics- 8/10 a little on the sketchy side.Difficulty-9/10Overall-37/40This game is a lot of fun to play, but i wish the graphics were better, like the PS2 games' graphics. But this game is a lot of fun with or without the graphics.Try out this game. You can't be dissapointed."
2,A disapointment for a LotR game...,"To start with, I am rating this as I could judge from playing the demo. My computer is lagging behind the recommended requirements now (I only have a nVidia TNT2), but I really couldn't even play with the lag I experienced. Vivendi is supposed to make its Lord of the Rings games based on the book. However, the first dwarf mission, finding a secret weapon from the Battle of the Five Armies, is pure crap. If it didn't have multiplayer, I would have given it one star. War of the Ring doesn't even have a map editor. This game is too similar to other RTS games, and doesn't match up to them in features."
2,BIG LETDOWN,"This game is not even close to what it could have and should have been. If you check out the reviews in any of the major gaming magazines they will tell you the same. Unfortuneately, I purchased the game before I read any of those reviews. The game runs on a two year old battle realms engine that is badly outdated, thus, the gameplay and overall experience does not even compare to that of Warcraft 3, or command and conquer games. The charchters are severely lacking in detail and this game is overall a big letdown, buy warcraft 3 instead!!!"
1,Not worth the price!,"this game is not worth the pirce! the campagin is comepletly random battles jumping from third age 1000s to thirda ge 3000s, the population limit is tiny! the troll stonehurlers are as a strong as a gondor swordsman! the riders of rohan have flails! no mumakil? dwraves?dwarves aren't fighinting for the free peoples!"
2,A Sadly Disappointing Game,"The War of the Ring has a good theme - you can either control the forces of good or the forces of evil and try to take over Middle Earth. It is about the Lord of the Rings books - not the movies. Unfortunately, that is where the compliments end. I have a Pentium 4, 2 Ghz computer yet the game is constantly freezing, looks fuzzy and takes 2-3 seconds for your mouse clicks to register. It also has long loading times and only two types of resources (ore and food). Just to make matters worse, 90% of the game is waiting for things to get built or resources to be collected. Just a warning to anyone out there who hasn't bought this game - DON'T waste your money or else you'll find out it is a sadly disappointing game yourself. Jeremy Smith, Age 11"
5,I love this game,I am a HUGE lord of the rings fan. I love all the movies and all the games but I have to say out of all the lord of he rings games I like this one probably the best. It has a huge replay value and I play it constantly. One of my top 10 games of all time. It's up there with battlefield bad company 2. I really love this game!
4,good game,"I dont see what everyone has against this game (except for the graphics, which raise the question: was Picasso on the design team?) as long as you ignore the fact that this is a LOTR game. It is fun to just get a bunch of trolls and a hero and smash everyone. As for BFME being better, I have to say this game was strong in certain areas and BFME was strong in certain areas, but if you were to choose between the two, pick BFME"
2,Very Disappointing,"An unoriginal effort to quickly package the LOTR into a lame RTS engine. I am a big fan of Tolkien and a big fan of strategy games, and this satisfies my hopes in neither of those categories."
3,Predictable and bland,"Very much like Command and Conquer. Missions (But not many), build units, attack, destroy everything, win, next mission, and so on. Its all been done before. You are limited to small hordes of units (<100) that are supposed to represent armies. You basically take your gang and go hunt down your enemies. Its not Epic like it should be, not even close. I see this as a ""cashing in"" game on all the LOTR hype. They could have made it much longer (Its beatable in a few hours on easy mode) and much more involved. It really lacks depth and richness.Nonetheless the graphics are good and the story is interesting.Overall its a bit dissapointing, but if you are a LOTR fan, go for it, you'll be entertained at least for a few hours."
4,An entertaining read.,Corinna Huntington is shocked by the libidinous & prejudicial Tudor Court. Count Rugar Kalisson also finds the English court distasteful & swears to show the English a thing or two. Corinna & Rugar find each other in the midst of the courts intrigue & end up causing a scandal themselves!
5,Great,"As advertised. Great little lubrication kit for your air tools. Bottle of air tool oil, tube of grease and grease pump for high pressure fittings."
5,haunting and magical,"I had put off buying this for a long time, only because folk music isn't really my bag. Fortunately for me I read an interview with Bill Frisell in which he mentioned that Stafford's version of ""Shenandoah"" had made a big impact on him. I can understand why. This is another ""must have"" for any Jo Stafford fan. It's worth purchasing for the first two tracks alone, which are intensely moving and flawlessly executed. The rest is icing on the cake (or maybe I just prefer slow tunes). I still gravitate toward her ""pop song"" records but I wouldn't part with this disc."
4,American Folk Songs - Jo Stafford,Nicely done. Great CD. I am impressed with the clean & clear for something that is digitally remastered?
5,Perfect,I purchased this CD when it came out as a japanese import CD at an horrendous price. However the music and the sound is fantastic. For those who are fans of Grusin's music it is a pleasure and sonically one of the best CDs I have to test equipement.
3,"Not as great as the 5 star reviews say, but pretty solid .......","I like ""She Could Be Mine"", by Don Grusin, but it is somewhat spoiled by the short passages of primitive synthesizer. And I have to say ""Anthem Internationale"" is a very pretentious title for a tune (written by Dave) that's not bad, except for more of that ancient synthesizer.""Serengeti Walk"" starts brilliantly and pretty much goes on with it. Dave's playing here is really good. If it is anything like a real Serengeti walk, head for Africa immediately. Can anyone say why it is subtitled ""(Slippin' Out The Back Door)"" inside the booklet, and ""(Slippin' In The Back Door)"" elsewhere?And it closes very sweetly with ""Sweetwater Nights""."
5,80's alternative,glad to get the cdthis music was an alternative to the trash that mainstream record producers were putting out in the 80'sfrom the composer/musician who gave us the st elsewhere theme
5,one of Dave Grusin's best!,"I too have the LP record of this & it was one of my favorites growing up.As a drummer, Steve Gadd's playing was an inspiration for me to try new things on my kit.Incidentally, this was the first CD I ever bought when they hit the market in the 80's.A true classic."
5,Smooth Jazz at its finest,"I came to the US in 1986 on vacation and first heard Dave Grusin on the radio while staying at the YMCA, ever since that day, I have loved the smooth sound of this artist.The music I heard at that time was from this album, what more can I say, it's about as perfect as you can get.My other Grusin recommendations: ""Harlequin"" (with Lee Ritenour), and ""Mountain Dance"".Enjoy!"
5,Great information at a great price,"I've used Chilton manuals for years and this book has more information than the old pro manuals that used to sell for $200 a piece. I don't think that ""puxatawni"" or Kyle are for real ... I mean the 1997 version didn't have Cooling fan wiring diagrams or component locations, or O2 sensor info. This book is worth a look."
3,Will probably require training,"Yeah... my Jardine's parrot can't figure this thing out. She still interacts with it once in a while but she cannot tilt it to cascade treats down to the window. I don't even know how any bird would do this, really.... mechanically speaking (even if they figured out the physics!). Getting it to tilt would, 9 of 10 times, I think, be the result of diligent target training. That being said, occasionally my parrot still (1) wrastles with it, since it bangs against the cage wall which produces pleasing, rowdy results and (2) takes food from the opening if it happens to be sitting there already. Even pellets, usually ill-favored, since they become less boring when plucked from a weird blue thing. Most of the time this is ignored, though. A good way to play WITH your parrot, however. Not so good for independent play in my experience."
4,Funny Insightful Journey,"This film reminded me a bit of the also excellent Jane Campion movie ""Sweetie"". The family here is made up of three overweight bickering sisters,an endearing substance abusing brother, a strange father who enjoys shooting birds out of trees for unclear reasons, and a dying mother.The character of the mother is the most interesting, from her admiration of Jackie O., to her bond with her wild son. The best sequence in the film has the son taking his mother to the beach where both binge on morphine and feel alive. Beautiful.Well drawn charecters, beautiful Australian scenery, and some very funny moments combine to make this a must see."
5,If you liked Muriel's Wedding...,"If you liked Muriel's Wedding then you will [probably] like this movie; if you like stories about dysfunctional Australian families, then you will [most likely] LOVE this movie. Funny, sad, a little over-acted [at times], but always very, very human. It's absolutely criminal that it is only available on VHS.b/b)O("
1,lost my interest,"At page 81, I put the book in my box of stuff to give to the charity thrift shop. It started off with a lot of promise, but never got off the ground for me. I tired of hearing how clever and smart young ""Luke"" was. It was not much of a story, just recollections of how life was for them on Pearl Street. No real character interaction, etc. Kind of like looking at a photo album of people I didn't know or care about."
2,"Many nice sentences, signifying nothing.","As a long-time fan of Trevanian, I came to The Crazyladies of Pearl Street with the usual anticipation reserved for favorite authors. The writer's craftmanship has clearly advanced relative to Shibumi and Summer of Katya. Trevanian crafted some nice Americana concerning urban experience the 1930's and 1940's, but the story was ultimately uninteresting and disappointing."
5,The immigrant sanction,"Trevanian is a wonderful and intriguing author. This thoroughly enjoyable and mostly autobiographical book was a delightful read, but in a far different way than the author's other books. No international intrigue going on here...just good old immigrant neighborhood intrigue. A wonderful journey into the childhood of a first generation American. The characters were extremely sympathetic. I especially loved the parts where jean-luc is playing by himself: where he is all the actors playing all the parts in the fantastic stories of his imagination. Brought back great day-long games of make believe from my own childhood.- C.A. Wulff, author of Born Without a Tail"
1,Awful,"I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice."
3,Two Social Beginners??,"I bought this for my 17 year-old daughter. We both read it and decided that it is more appropriate for younger readers. The author does make some very good points about relationships, things that are all too often ignored by both parenta and adolescents alike."
3,Knowing your dog,I have several dogs and thought it would be good to know a little about how they think things through. Very detailed and complete and not an easy read but worth it.
5,I really like this level for some reason.,"A three foot level is not a very commonly owned tool. I don't work with or even know anybody else who has one besdies myself and people are always trying to run off with it. But I say NUts to that and keep it stashed where nobody can get at it. Except for me. Mostly it's good for putting in oddly sized windows and i guess it's aight for throwing in 3-0 doors, it fits snugly between the jambs and all that, in case you just really don't trust your two foot level or whatever. But yeah, mostly it's just like a four footer but shorter, or a two footer but longer. As goldi locks said at one point or another, ""it's just right"". So there you have it. Be cool. Own a three foot level. Stabila preferably."
5,"Stabila 48"" Level",Level was brand new and price was reduced from local stores and plus it had free shipping. Shipping was fast and product is all it was advertised to be. Great service and easy site to use to order from. Will use site to order more tools when I need them. H.A. Stupka
1,when people do not read what is written,I love the fragrance called Eau D Eden by Cacharel. I bought it in Paris when travelling there. So I thought I would try the internet to buy some more.(It is not available in Australia). I was sent a fragrance called Eden even though I ordered Eau D Eden and that was on the order form. When I tried to get the correct item all the company would do was to refund the difference in price. So I am left with a product that I do not like and will never use.
3,Classic vampire B movie,"My husband was one of the volunteer actors in this movie. He also attended the opening at The Claremont Colleges. I had seached for this movie for years as it was not sold under its original working title. I gave it to him for Valentine's Day and he was thrilled. I had never seen it and wasn't expecting much, and I have to say I was impressed. For an old, low budget B movie I thought it was pretty good. The HD remastering made for a very clear picture. I think this could easily be a cult classic."
3,Interesting Vampire tale,"For someone interested in female Vampires this film is worth seeing. However, if you really want to see a fine film featuring the female of the species ""Dracula's Daughter"" (1936) is still the best film to see by far."
4,Creepiest Vampire Flick Ever,"I use to see this film decades ago on WOR-TV 9! This film has the creepiest atmosphere of any horror film! With a dark country setting full of terrorfying houls, a rather creepy long hair old woman, and perhaps the creepiest female vampire ever in Lemora! It looks like an American version of Transylvania!If you like ultra-creepy, schockley horror films of the early 1970's, than this film may be the ultimate chioce for you!"
2,One of the weirdest movies....,"There are people out there who gave this movie 5 stars. 5! And they said this was scary. This is actually one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. It is filled with tons of sexual innuendo. Everything from pedophilia to lesbianism. If that what people find scary, then perhaps it is. The person who played LEMORA looks like some dude with a mild case of acromegaly. And not surprisingly, she has never been in another movie. The people who gave this movie 4 or 5 stars are either NOT horror movie fans, or are basing there reviews soley on nostalgia. Perhaps this movie was scary some 30 yrs. ago, but today it only comes off as weird. If you are really interested in horror movies, read my other reviews for good horror movies."
4,"""Real"" stories","The writings in this book gave me an insight into some of the most ""real"" experiences in our history. The writings are moving and are so deep you actually feel like you are living what they're writing. It helped me understand to not be so quick to judge people in prison and to remember that although they are in there, they are still human beings."
4,Excellent Keychain Flashlight for the Money,"I have owned this Coast keychain flashlight for over two months now, and use it in one of the harshest environments I think a flashlight could see, that being Iraq. Every night this gets used 5-6 times as the base is very dark, and I have had ZERO problems with it. It shines bright enough to illuminate several feet in front of you, and makes tasks very easy to accomplish given that it's really bright up close.I found that you can turn the little pocket clip to cover the on/off button, and then push in the center of the clip. This will push the on/off button, but keeps from accidentally turning it on.The one downside is that the black coating comes off pretty easily it'd seem. I started noticing this about two days after I started using it on my keychain. Nothing can ever be perfect, but a tougher finish would definitely be a plus, and is the only reason I haven't given this product a 5 rating."
4,a tiny bright flashlight for those who can use one,"This is a keychain-sized LED light that projects a bright, blue-white, very uniformly illuminated circle (about 6 inches across from 2 feet away). I find a surprising number of uses for it since it's always with me on my (you guessed it) keychain. It has worked very well; the only reason for the 4 stars is that Coast has made it about twice as large as it needs to be, and it would be even more useful and inconspicuous at half the size."
4,"Nice light, but made in China (?) not Germany (?)","Neatly packed, comes in a box with a booklet showing different types of lights. I would have giving this light 5 stars but in the product description it says German-engineered, but it has stamped made in China on on the box, so I would guess the light is also made in China, otherwise it seems the box would also have German engineered on it. Product description is rather misleading. Price is good, better than other sites which could be twice as much, but could get a similar bright light made in China for about $3 to $5. Otherwise, it is attractive, the right size, and it does have a nice bright light, so far, which is great. Haven't used it long enough to see how long it is going to last."
5,Bruce,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The maps were excellent, the writing clear. I've read other reviews and there is some question of accuracy of details, but such arguments i'll leave to the professional historians/military folk. I give this book a real thumbs up for the average military reader such as myself."
4,A Keeper,"There are very few books I keep permantly. Catch 22, Lord of the Rings and this one I refer to continually. However, I wish he would have given a more info. on the terms of the French Revolution as he refers to Jacobists and the Acien Regime as if the reader already knows what this implies. He also uses French phrases with no intrepretation. That criticism aside there is ample use of maps and detailed description of battles and campaigns. As well as the events that caused them. Chandler is sometimes blamed for being pro anglo, but after reading his book you appreciate the awesome ability of Napleon."
5,There is Nothing Better,"Chandler's work is outstanding in everyway: readability, clarity of presentation, depth of understanding, and the ability to cogently offer it all up to the reader. This book is not for beginners, certainly, for it assumes a basic level of understanding of the Napoleonic era, geography, army organizations, and so forth. However, if you want to reading the single definitive study of Napoleon and his military achievements, this is the volume to own."
4,A Classic.,"This book not only discusses each of the military actions of Napoleon, from his ill-fated attempt to recover Corsica for the Revolution to the 100 Days, but also discusses some of the favorite tactics and organization of his armies. Very readable, although its length will deter any but the serious student of military history. One of the books I had in my duffel bags during the Gulf War."
5,The best single-volume history of Napoleon's campaigns.,"Chandlers' Campaigns of Napoleon is the best single-volume history of Napoleon's military genious with careful commentary on logistics, politics, and innovations. The maps are wonderful and easy to follow. Every American Civil War general studied Napoleon - you cannot understand the military background of the American Civil War without understanding Napoleon and this book is the way to do that."
2,where is the love?,"Okay . . . I picked this up thinking I was going to get one of those typical beach reads . . . you know -- girl works at some ridiculously well paying job in London doing some kind of work that allows her to somehow meet a man that can't possibly exist in nature -- good looking, sensitive, they have great chemistry and all that. But that's not what this is. This really isn't a love story at all -- despite the title. I wasn't really feelin' this at all. The story is completely unrealistic -- which can be fun -- but this plot line had so many holes in it -- it was just annoying. As a reader, you are unable to care about her relationship."
3,"Familiar Plot, Amusing Character","Unless you live in a hut, we've all seen the movies where a character is suddenly tranferred back to her youth (Jennifer Garner in particular?)Flora, the novel's heroine, encounters that moment at a friend's wedding where she wants to do it all over again.Considering I didn't finsh the novel because there wasn't enough of a draw to the writing style and story line to keep my attention, readers may enjoy the likable heroine."
2,Can't win'em all.,"Plain and simple, I listened to it once and I'll be recyclingit soon. Don't assume that when you hear something on the radiothat you'll like the whole CD it comes from. Oh well."
2,the ending was a total cop-out!,"I really wanted to like this movie, if only for it's strangeness, but was too disappointed with the writing and lowly production values -and the gigantic holes in the plot."
5,Please release the DVD,"This is a great movie and needs to be released on DVD, NOW!When can we expect it?"
4,"Computer Comes to Life, Falls in Love","Miles, the nerdiest of nerds, buys a computer, overloads it with info from work, dumps wine on the keyboard and soon, this computer has a mind of its own. The computer (Edgar) makes Miles' life miserable as they vie for the same girl (Madeline) played by Virginia Madsen.Great movie, even greater soundtrack from songs from Culture Club and other artists.Highly recommend and wish the price would come down."
2,Electric Dreams DVD,"I've been waiting a long time for ""Electric Dreams"" to come to DVD so I was delighted to find it available. However, when I loaded it on my DVD player, I was disappointed to find that the picture began to ""roll"" like the old ""vertical"" adjustments on the old style TVs. This was common in the early days with black and white TVs but extremely uncommon with the modern flat screens and there is no adjustment to correct it (at least I don't know of one...) I was able to get it to work on my desktop computer and this was the only reason I didn't return it. I don't know how this movie was copied onto DVD but there needs to me greater care to guarantee that the product performs as expected. Great movie but a big disappointment with the performance of the DVD"
5,Sums up the 80's for me!,"80's was a time when love, imagination and music was everything in a teenagers dream. Movie's like Star Wars and St. Elmos Fire, bands like Duran Duran and Journey, were all everyone talked about. Electric Dream's was one of those movie's kept dear to my heart. Influencing me into the world of computers (Im a graphic designer) and clasical music (im a guitar player still trying to learn ""The Duel"", go figure). Electric Dreams and the soundtrack sums up the 80's, and my life. A humble thanks to the creators. NOW JUST DROP THE PRICE!! =P"
5,80's Fun,"Where is the DVD? Have you seen some of the other crap that has come out on DVD from the 80's? This one is a no brainer, it should have been released on disc years ago. Hurry up !!"
4,musical computer = love ???,"Exactly, this movie has to be put on dvd. It just may show some people that comedy and computers can exist.... That is possible. Seriously, this movie will make the movie goer in most of us feel sorry for the computer. And the music is great."
4,wish I could buy it!!,"I saw this movie on cable about 13 years ago, and I have been wanting to own it ever since. Most people haven't even heard of ""Electric Dreams"", which is a shame because it is such a great story! A ""nerdy"" architect falls for a beautiful cellist in the same apartment building. The romantic element of the movie manages not to become sappy because of an ironic twist: the architect's computer falls in love with the cellist as well! At first, the computer helps the awkward fellow woo the girl, but quickly decides to sabotage lover boy and win her for itself! Getting the audience to believe that the computer is alive is quite a feat considering the limited special effects...but it works. I was alternately rooting for one and then the other, and even cried at the end. I would LOVE to own this movie, especially since I can't even find it to rent anymore. However, until the price comes down..."
5,When will this be out on DVD?,"I live in Hong Kong where this movie is available on VCD, on two discs, where the quality is very good but not to DVD standards. I first saw the film on tape in the 90's when I lived in Greece and have been a big fan of it ever since. I watched it yet again the other afternoon. I keep on checking with IMDB to see if the studios have come to their senses and released it on DVD but no luck so far."
4,"It's like Gremlins, don't give your P.C. a drink!","I never forgot this movie I saw when I was still a child (I was Born in 1973). The music duet between Virginia Madsen (she's in Dune as well) and the computer is one of the greatest music moments of my life. I never saw it again on television (why not? After all, at least the theme song Electric Dreams was a very big hit - I just couldn't get enough of listening to it at the time).I must say when I saw it that I thought the girl was too good for the guy and that the computer must have been a not too distant relative of 2001's psychopathic Hall-2000. But even the computer is a sort of Romeo-like tragic lover, much more romantic than the leading man.I loved the fact that in the movie liquids like champagne and tears have magical powers to bring inanimate, cold technology to life and love. It didn't seem cheesy to me. It still doesn't."
4,Great computer movie,"I liked this movie so much that when I got my first computer I named it ""Edgar"". This is a great romantic comedy and made me a Virginia Madsen fan. The sound track is fabulous even for an aging baby boomer like me. I, too, am waiting for the price to come down so I can purchase the movie."
4,great story .,I loved this film when I saw it back in 1984. It is not often that you find a film that makes you feel anything about an inanimate objects. I have looked for this film on tape for years. The tape is currently out of print. That is why it is so expensive.
1,Bummer,"I would like to rate it, but the disc can't be played on our US machines. I have gotten a real education on Regions and color formats. This DVD being Region O is OK, but the color format was PAL, which will not play on our players here in the US, which is Region 1.To be able to play here, Regions 0,1 are good. But the color format must be NTSC, or it won't play!!!Why don't the media companies know those things? Why do they mail out DVD's knowing that PAL will NOT play here in the US? A waste of time and money. I have to eat the shipping on the four DVD's I have had shipped to me, all of them a birthday gift to a friend. Frustrating.H. F. Baker"
5,Would LOVE to see this come out on DVD,"I've been looking for this movie on DVD for years (of course, it has never been released on DVD--which is hindering my efforts! =). Perhaps if enough of us Electric Dreams fans shout loud enough, they will see a money-making opportunity and give us what we want to buy. Here's hoping, anyway..."
5,Great movie!!,"LOVE this movie. So wish I could buy it on DVD. Really funny w great music. ""Love is Love"" by Culture Club was on my Summer 2011 wedding CD!"
3,Good,I remember seeing this in the theater and was instantly hooked on this now classic movie. If you love it get it
4,Want a DVD version of this movie!,"Oh, my goodness, I hope they have a DVD for this movie soon. My sister and I really enjoyed watching this movie and the soundtrack was fun too! I liked Virginia Madsen in this and sometimes when I read her bios, they forget to mention she even made this movie. Not fair! It was nothing to be embarrassed about. I agree with most of the other customers' reviews. Please get it on DVD soon! For now, just like the other customer, the soundtrack will have to do. Or I will have to go and buy me a new VHS tape player! :-)For those of you who have not watched it yet, go do it!"
5,Esta pelicula definió mi carrera universitaria,"Al ver esta pelicula me hizo pensar en querer dominar las computadoras y realmente me interesé por ellas. Es por eso que elegí la carrera de Ingenieria en Sistemas Computacionales, asi que puedo decir que significa mucho en mi vida. Espero que la puedan liberar en DVD muy pronto."
1,BUY NEWER EDITION - DARTS BEGINNING TO END,"Let me say firstly that George is a great dart writer, and that this is a great book, and an expansion of a brilliant pamphlet on throwing darts. However, instead of putting out a new revised edition of this, he expanded the book and changed the name to DARTS: Beginning to End. This covers the flight school regimen and encompasses everything that is in this book. Buy this instead. It gets 5 five stars and is essential."
3,Good overview of Nazi's; oversold on the Valkyrie subject,"I watched this after seeing the Tom Cruise movie, to hopefully get more details to fill in the history of the plot. It is about an hour long, and starts with a detailed history of the rise of Hitler. After about 30 minutes, we haven't delved too much into the plot. The last ten minutes seemed rushed, discussing the failed plot, and subsequent executions of the plotters. There could have been more coverage of the kangaroo trials than there was, and also it totally was silent on the piano wire strangulation of some of the plotters. It shows the meathooks, with no explanation that this was the hanging room, and that Hitler had the slow deaths filmed so he could watch it. This would be a good film for someone without a lot of knowledge of the Nazi regime and rise to power, but doesn't have enough of the title subject in its content."
2,It's been done...,This documentary is nothing new even though it purports to augment the Valkyrie plot story with details. It was disappointing and mercifully short. It doesn't go into the kind of detail I was hoping for in regard to the setting of the stage for the audacious revolt which was attempted and which failed so spectacularly.I suspect there are much better productions out there somewhere.
4,Killing Hitler: The True Story Of The Valkyrie Plot,Killing Hitler: The True Story Of The Valkyrie Plot is one of several films on the topic. It is fairly good in comparison to the others.[...]
4,Clásico,Escuchar al Miles Davis del bebop y del cool es una experiencia fantástica. Tener esta grabación es poder escuchar una época inigualable.
3,A must have for your collection,"These recordings are a must have for an understanding of the shear evolution of jazz, but not the best."
5,"An essential jazz album, melodically beyond bop technicals.","While later Miles focused on smaller groups and beautiful weavings of different tonalities, here, he is very young and quite assured handling 9-10 players and instruments not often found on jazz albums. Obviously aware of Diz's bop and the Big Band, Mile explores a third dimension, neither technical virtuosity nor kickin' dance songs but a place of melody, space, articulation, modulation, integration - and this was just the beginning!"
2,Not Great,"I am a big Miles fan and was disappointed with this album. It's probably just me....but I like the ""Sketches of Spain"", ""Kinda Blue"" or ""Porgy and Bess"" sound. This is a little bit too fast for me to really enjoy."
1,Birth of teh cool,"Poor recording. I played it on my vacuum tubes system and it sounds flat while ""kind of blue"" and ""best of Miles Davis and John Coltrane"" fills the living room and it sounds like an orchestra hall."
5,Excellent Miles Davis Cd!,Perhaps I am impartial because I really don't think anything Miles Davis has done has not been without obvious genius and hasn't sounded good. Though I don't think Birth of Cool was as good as say Porgy and Bess or Kind of Blue but this is a definite cd you want in your Davis collection.
3,Inspired but not required,"3 1/2Disengaged from all the album has come to represent (I refuse to base ratings on historical context and can only honor emotional resonance as a guide), it's an easy going but quality-driven big band mild alternative which does stay rooted in the expected, but does so with enough grace and grit to keep things worthwhile. One can only imagine how cool it would have been though, to witness this actual birth as it arrived."
3,great album photo,despite playing with a electic mix of players that would go on to greatness of their own birth of the cool has a very dated feel to it. unlike mileses later works kind of blue and '58 which seem to have stood the test of time better...one of the weakness's of cool is probably due to the fact that so many band members needed to strech out so the album suffer from a cohesiveness that a true band brings to the table..but it miles and it worth a listen
4,UNA JOYA DE COLECCION,"Una joya para coleccionistas. Es muy escasa la discografia de este excelente cantante. Me costó mucho conseguirlo, pero su calidad de sonido es pobre (algunas pistas."
3,Good technically...mediochre interpretations,"I wanted to agree with all of the points of the previous reviewer. However I do live in Dallas and do find that this manages to give me the illusion of the Meyerson Symphony Center in my living room. One error the previous reviewer made when he or she wrote, ""The video consists of still scenes of a museum during the Also Sprach"", that was not a museum, that was the outside and lobby area of the Meyerson Symphony Center. My hope is that Litton someday will be replaced by a world class conductor, or grow into one if he ever decides on appropriate tempos, phrasing and articulation."
5,Everyone Deserves Second Chances...,"This book is phenomenal. I commend the author for creating a romance story that is profound and endearing. With both Brandt and Willow battling their own personal demons, in additon to their feelings for eachother, you can't help but root for them. I love balanced romance stories that are based on so much more than lust and superficial conflict. Ms. Glass is gifted and tells this story so that you genuinely understand each character's past, flaws, and motives. I would LOVE to see sequels to this book and hope that the author writes stories for Mack and Antonio."
5,The Glenn Miller Orchestra directed by Jimmy Henderson,These CDs are of the 1977-1981 editions of the licensed Glenn Miller Orchestra under the leadership of trombonist Jimmy Henderson. There are no memebers of the original GMO on this cd nor is the trombone of Glenn.
2,Don't buy this,"I bought this seat because it looked safe with the guard and it was a good price but once i put it in the car no matter how tight I got the seatbelt it still flops from side to side and I find myself constantly reaching into the backseat trying to straighten it, NOT the safest thing to do while trying to drive. Also after a couple of months of use I felt something crack on the side headrest and when I lifted it up the padding was nothing but styrofoam, that doesn't seem safe or comfortable. I would definetly recommend buying another carseat."
2,this carseat is unsafe,"I bought this carseat for my daughter 6 months ago. Now the styrofoam is coming out of the back of it, I have contacted Graco to try to get them to recall it but, I do not belive they really care. For my daughters saftey I have stopped using this carseat and bought her a more relibable one."
1,Don't see this car seat as safe,"I bought this car seat 7 months ago, and now the styrofoam under the cloth cover is breaking off. I contacted babiesrus about it and I get referred to Graco. No one seems to care and I get an excuse that is not under safety guidelines. There must have been a reason Graco put the styrofoam there. I don't like the fact that there is not anything between the padding and the hard plastic of the car seat. I don't see how this would help my child in an event of a impact and his head would hit the sides. Now I am out $80+ and I have to go buy a new car seat. I used to be confident in Graco products, but not anymore"
1,gotta love nerfs,"Mythic really messed up a fun game with all of the timesinks they introduced with this expansion. I won't reiterate the comments below, but I wanted to post this caveat ---Some of the new artifacts in this expansion are quite overpowered. When players complained about how overpowered one of these artifacts in particular was, Mythic reduced its power. However, they reduced its power so as to make it useless.So if you're considering buying this expansion, and are willing to spend the hours finding your dream artifact, and the hours sitting around waiting to find the scrolls that activate your artifact, and the hours levelling up your artifact, beware --- it may very well be that Mythic will decide, after you spend all that time, to make your artifact useless."
1,Wait for a price break,"There are currently WAY too many bugs in this expansion pack. Patches will fix them, eventually, maybe. The enhanced graphics are nice, if your system can handle them, but it certainly isn't worth $25. I'd wait for the price to drop to $10-15. Dark Age of Camelot is still superior to other MMORPGs currently on the market, and the upcoming FREE expansion should keep it that way for at least the next year. Just don't be too anxious to get your hands on an expansion that is still basically being tested."
1,Highly NOT recommended,"If you are just starting this game, this expansion pack is most definitely not for you. You cannot start Trial 1 until you are level 40. Frankly, if you go to TOA before you are 50, you will end up losing alot of gold and xp. I have several level 50's and die frequently in TOA. The main reason *NOT* to get this expansion is that you will be extremely frustrated. You will not be able to find a group to help you complete the trials. Why? Because they have all moved on to the higher level ML's. No one..I mean NO ONE..is going to repeat any trials or help you complete them. So all in all, you're paying for a slight graphic upgrade. The trials themselves are worthless. You need HUGE groups to complete them and if you are somewhat casual gamer, you won't get them done for all the reasons I stated above. This expansion turned a nice game into a horrible game. Many people are leaving due to this expansion. I would not recommend it."
2,Cruddy expansion for great game.,"If you're thinking about playing daoc, buy the platinum edition, it includes all the expansions currently available for $29.xx and you won't regret it. If you've already bought gold or classic, you don't need to even think about ToA until you're close to level 40. (for those of you who haven't played, levels top out at 50) If you are a casual player (have a life, or don't have time/money to level 2+ accounts to 50) don't add ToA on, it'll be months before you see any benefit, and it's just not that fun. The rest of the game is very enjoyable, and you don't need this annoyance to enjoy it. Good graphics though, and it has a slightly upgraded standard interface."
2,"Bought, but rarely use","Have several level 50 toons, and got this expansion because as many have said it's a ""must have"" in order to survive in RvR - the main/only ""end-game"" to DAoC.Main reason I don't use it anymore is they enormously sacrificed performance for eye candy. Using a 3Ghz, 1M, Nvidia system it's still a totally porked out lag-fest. Just try walking through Camp forest without looking at the ground and you'll probably lag all the way to Sauvage before you rubber-band back.I only load ToA to assist guildy's with their quests, then go back to the much more fun and much faster SI engine for regular game play.I'd only recommend this xpack to well developed characters. New players don't need it and would cause more frustration than fun. If your new to the game, get SI and have a blast. When you're 50, get ToA to do the quests, then go back to SI to enjoy the game again."
3,should I?,"I have been reading up on DAoC for about a week now, pondering over whther or not i should get the game. Everything seemed gravy before I almost got in my car, then i see the reviews for ToA. People are saying this is a horrible expansion and has completely killed DAoC. I myself have never even played an MMORPG before. Now I'm wondering whether or not i should actually get just Dark Age of Camelot Gold Edition. Should I? Is DAoC even worth buying anymore for a noob like myself? rest assured I will be avoiding Trials of Atlantis at all costs no matter what decision I make, but it would help to have some input as to whether or not i should just get the original game and Shrouded Isles."
1,A great game gone bad,"DAoC was a great game until ToA came along. If you are even considering buying this expansion pack, or the game itself, read the rest of the reviews here on Amazon. They're not too far from the truth. Its amazing how Mythic lost touch with their game and customer base. BIG disappointment!"
4,Trials of Atlantis review?,"Is this a Trials of Atlantis review or a rant and rave section about Dark Age of Camelot?Plain and simple this game is great. Everyone has said the expansions make it better and better and that's true. But please people stick to the subject here.Trials of Atlantis is supposed to have some of the best graphics of any MMORPG to date. From what I have seen from the beta I would have to agree. The new underwater system is a trip along with the new tradeskill recipies. I am looking forward to playing this expansion the moment it arrives at my home.Why only 4 stars then? Because I have yet to actually sit and play this expansion. I was only able watch someone on beta testing. But, from what I have seen and read it is going to be a great expansion just like Shrouded Isles was."
1,Dark Age of Camelot is officially dead as a doornail,"Lots of other reviewers have already pointed out this expansion's bugs & problems...& they are not exaggerating in the slightest.After two years of playing DAoC, this expansion, combined with Mythic's unwillingness & inability to fix long standing existing bugs/balance issues, finally caused us to cancel our family's three accounts...& it was probably long overdue.Avoid DAoC at all costs, as most of the players left in the game still hanging on are the least desirable elements left in the online gaming community (powergamers, ... kiddies, etc). Almost everyone with any sense has already jumped ship...& await upcoming MMORPG game releases that will hopefully be treated better by their creators than Mythic has treated poor DAoC. Trust me, ToA is only one of many reasons to now avoid DAoC."
1,Horrible mess for a great game,"This exp pack ruined a good game, unreal how a company can make such a huge mistake after a good track record."
1,How to ruin a game,"It's beyond my comprehension how anyone can shill this abomination unless they are a mythic employee.You've already seen the complaints, let me assure you they are not ill founded. Mythic is totally out of touch with its player base. For two years I played this (formerly great) game, had 50's in all realms, and tried to get my friends involved.Now I'm telling everyone to run, not walk, away from this game.DAOC is nothing but an exercise in futility now. Wait for World of Warcraft and save yourself a lot of time, money and unnecessary pain."
1,"So bad, it ruined the original game...","I've been playing DAOC since it was released, and considered it the best MMORPG to be released so far.Then comes TOA. Very EQ-like PvE, there's no more flexibility that made classic DAOC so good, you need to do all these trials and equipment hunts with very demanding group requirements. If you don't like it, maybe you're just not interested in zerging these super mobs, or play offpeak, on an underpopulated server, or too briefly to be able to find good solid balanced groups or small armies... too bad.What really makes that terrible though is that it ruins RvR. Now, if you're the unfortunate type not to benefit from TOA's rigid progresssion system, that's depressing enough, but also, your character won't be up to par anymore. You can still do fine running with zergs, that's a great equalizer, but it's not much consollation for those of us who just hate feeling gimped like that. It really killed the game for me."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are looking for additional stuff for DAoC for the casual gamer, don't waste your money. The only thing that makes this expansion even remotely worth it is the new graphics. The content stinks, Master Levels are impossible for small groups and if you don't have a level 50 char, don't even bother going. Most groups won't take chars lower than 50.All in all, if I had it to do over, I would not buy this expansion."
1,How a Expansion Pack can kill a good game,Camelot was a fine game. The game was geared so that a normal players or fanatics could compete on an even playing field and enjoy the game whether they played for an hour or 8.This expansion pack has introduced an environment that is totally unenjoyable to the casual player and has replaced 'tedious and time consuming' tasks for what was once fun. You will need the expansion pack in order to compete.. however my idea of fun isn't time sinks.
1,AOnce great game killed by the hands of its own company!,"Played for 5 or 6 years, 3 accounts. This game died from lack of proper management by its own company. Once a great game now its on its death bed! Best RVR/PVP game I ever played and I miss the old days and old friends of the early years."
1,Trials of Atlantis is SO LAME...,"Just the most horrible expansion ever. Mythic, the makers of Dark Age of Camelot have ruined the game with this expansion. If you do not have this expansion you might as well quit the game since you will never be viable on realm vs. realm fights. With the expansion prepare to spend weeks getting Master Level abilities and Artifacts.Once you have spent the weeks and weeks getting the MLs and Artifacts (if you can stomach the bugs and unbelievably long camping times) you will be... exactly as powerful as you were before Trials of Atlantis to those who have also gotten them.This expansion is a real real real stinker. The only good thing is that it has a very nice graphics update. Aside from that people are so annoyed with Mythic over this expansion pack they are quitting the game in droves."
1,Total POS,This game emcompasses everything DAOC players didn't want and hurts or ignores everything DAOC is about.
1,A Very Odd Change in Direction,"Long boat rides, additional PvE levelling, large PvE raids, camping a spawn, long spawn times, kill stealing, slow character movement in water, and more. Everquest? Nope, this is the new Dark Age of Camelot.Mythic appears to be taking DAoC in a direction none of its long-time subscribers are likely to have guessed. One that would move the game away from its RvR roots (DAoC's excellent team-oriented PvP). This change might have been interesting to me had it been innovative and offered something unique. Unfortunately, most of what I see has the feel of something that's already been done elsewhere. Combine that with the fact that this expansion offers no new RvR content - no new RvR zones, no new RvR objectives, no new keep floorplans, no new seige equipment - and it gets a very low rating from me."
1,Don't bother,They managed to take all the things bad about EQ and stick them in one neat expansion. The need for groups. The need to camp spawns. Only one person getting an item from quests.In short all the things I started DAoC for. They seem to have forgotten.Save your money
2,Tortures of Atlantis,"If you enjoy EQ camping this is the expansion for you! Riddled with bugs and unbalancing the RvR endgame, this expansion should not have got out the door. There should be a warning label ""Required a large unusually supportive alliance and 40+ hours per week to devote to PvE."" On the plus side the artwork/models are beautiful and there are some very clever level designs. Unfortunately it takes DAOC in a direction many are unwilling to go. Casual players beware."
1,This expansion is the death of daoc,"Absolutly horrible. Almost everything is bugged quests, master levels, and artifacts. They decided to beta test it on the live crowd i guess. Just try to get some help from a CSR when something goes horribly wrong.Seriously i canceled my accounts and im not comming back unless they do something spectacular. Dont buy this expansion!"
1,Highly disappointed,"I checked out the customer reviews before buying this product, but decided to take a chance anyway. BIG mistake.I am so disappointed in what Mythic has done to Dark Age of Camelot by releasing this exansion.The expansion assumes you will have 8 or more friends online running with you, or you can't really do anything.The quests and objectives are tedious, take a lot of time, and highly frustrating. Expect to spend most of your time waiting for other players to group with you, or waiting on steps to reset, or recover from dying again and again. You will stand around a lot doing nothing but wait.Hats off to the power gamers that put up with all of this, but it isn't for me. Next time I will listen to what others are saying about a game before I buy it.Purchasing ""Trials of Atlantis"" has led to me canceling my account with Mythic, yes it was that bad."
1,Has convinced a hardcore fan to quit,"This expansion was a terrible mistake and a drastic departure from mythic's previous game plan. It is essentially a massive, 1000-hour time synch to aquire equipment and abilities, without which you cannot even remotely compete with your realm adversaries. If you do not have 1000s of hours you will be a second class citizen. If you have more than one character, you cannot play them both effectively, no matter how much time your have. If you do not enjoy mundane tasks and losing a lot, you will not like this game.Please do not buy this game. Wait for World of Warcraft or something else.-Retired R7L5 Paladin et al."
2,"It was supposed to be an expansion, not a new game","Most of the other ranters have hit the flaws with this game on the nose. My point is simply that if Mythic wanted to totally change game dynamic, perspective, and approach, they should have made a new game instead of trying to do it with an expansion pack. Expansion packs are designed to do just that, expand on the game in place, and not dramatically change it. As a result they have alienated their players who came to love and applaud the game they signed up for, not the one Mythic tried to change it into. If you want a different game, why don't you make a new one? It would have been much nicer to see Mythic address class and realm balancing issues as well as clean out some long term bugs with the new XP rather than add to them. As a result, Mythic is frantically updating their XP to try and accommodate for the drop in subscriptions.On the plus side the graphics really are quite impressive!"
2,Needs to be updated,"This book was written for a time when libraries used card catalogues. It is out of date and not appropraite for my needs. The information is good for high school students who are writting a term paper. It has some good basics, but I was looking for help on writing at the grad. school level."
4,Dad Was a Carpenter by Kenny Kemp,"Thought provoking and powerful!! It as a delight to read a book that truly illustrates how important it is to do things in life well and with great love. Great book, I highly recommend it!"
5,I Love ABOFAL!,"I'd never heard of Hugh Laurie until ""House, MD"", but after seeing a lot of ABOFAL clips on the net I decided to buy this DVD. It's so funny! Way better than Saturday Night Live, in my opinion.The humor is sophisticated and not pandering to the lowest common denominator like so much so called comedy on TV these days. I've had to watch the DVD over and over just to ""get"" some of the jokes. I LOVE that. Not figuring out the punchline when the joke starts is awesome!Stephen Fry is great too. I'd seen him in ""V for Vendetta"" but ABOFAL is the first comedic thing I've seen him do. He cracks me up.Even if you've never heard of either of these two actors, you should get this DVD if you like comedy. It's one of those you can watch over and over and never get tired of it."
2,Poor Quality Edition,"I've only begun to read the book and it appears to live up to its reputation as an important critique of modern society. However, I don't think I'll be able to read it because of the minuscule fuzzy type and coarse paper. A quality paper back or Kindle edition would be most welcome."
1,"Probably very interesting book, but...","This is about ""mass market paperback"" edition. Probably very interesting book. Unfortunately, I am not able to read it. Production quality is extremely poor. Format is small, about a postcard size, font is 8pt. Pring is blurred, dark gray, on light qray, extremely poor quality paper. Font intensity and blurness is different on almost each page. Even with magifying glass reasing reading is hard.Returning to Amazon and will invest more monies to purchase ""not mass market"" edition"
4,Bought for seminar,"I have bought this book for my seminar of technology. I have to say that the language is in low level, but the font text is little spread.The book is very interesting, thought-provoking and I'm realy recommending.Liad."
2,Boring. Repetitive. Atrocious.,"I had to buy this book for a Building Technology class. Ellul emphasizes and nuances his point of technique far too many times. If you just read the introductions, you pretty much get an idea of what's going on throughout the whole book. Sentences take up entire paragraphs and it's written horribly. Don't buy unless you have to."
1,Very Pretty but pretty useless,"I purchased this level, and the also the 32inch version thinking I would be getting a well designed accurate tool that I would own for years. Wrong.Why? The bubble in the vials is 3/32""+ smaller than the lines in the vials. This forces me to 'eyeball' the space on both sides of the bubble and hope that the amount of space is the same. Wow, talk about 'slop' in a tool.So, 'Accuracy guaranteed for life' takes on a new meaning when the 'accuracy' is + or - 3/32 inch in every 16 inches of surface being leveled.I have a 12inch level form a well known manufacturer available in most stores and it has a bubbles that are the same size as the space between the lines in the vial making it accurate and dependable. I think I will stick with the cheaper brand and leave these toys for the kids who like shiny stuff and bright colors."
4,An excellent book to get you to rethink what you know!,"An excellent book to get you to start using some critical thinking skills. The author points out that what we think is so often is not. He did however pass on a myth that is not correct. He passed on the myth of glass being a liquid, when it isn't. Glass is an amorphous solid and not a liquid. It's crystalline structure clearly places as a solid and not a liquid. (Read S.R. Elliott's book, Amorphous Solids, An Introduction)This is but one source among many that will confirm this. I dare say that Mr. Varasdi confirms his own point! All in all a book well worth reading."
3,ideas here applied to television,"I was looking through this book recently because I had read and reviewed a book called Modeling Behaviors from Images of Reality in Television Narratives: Myth Information and Socialization by Tony R. DeMars. I think someone reading that book about influences of TV shows on childrens' behavior who doesn't quite grasp the idea of the myths we build our world around as reality would do well to read this book also--as well as a book that came out in the mid-80s called No Sense of Place, by Joshua Meyrowitz. Some people seem to have a hard time stepping back from their 'reality' and seeing these myths."
2,Riddled with misinformation,"If you're going to try to correct falsehoods, it's best to make sure that you yourself are correct. In the first few pages of the ""A"" section, Varasdi repeatedly refers to early aircraft as ""aerodromes"" (which is like calling a ""racing car"" a ""racetrack"") and claims that Horatio Alger wrote about young boys because he was homosexual (when in fact he was a pedophile.) The book is entertaining in places, but is best viewed as a diversion rather than a source of solidly-researched information."
2,Don't believe the hype! Save your $50.,"This book doesn't even live up to its title. It's difficult to find what you are looking for. Hopefully the author wasn't expecting me to read it cover-to-cover. Just look at all the people selling their used Little Handbooks for $5! The older editions go for even less money. You would think that after 8 editions they would have improved the utility. If you REALLY want one, by a $5 used one."
4,LBHb review,"The book is pretty good. I have used it since my early college days. One of the problems I have is the book does not provide an answer key to the exercises. This can be frustrating if you are trying to learn and want to make sure you are doing things properly (I have the 5th edition- not sure if the other editions are the same). The book says that you can buy the answer key seperately, unfortunately, I have not been able to find it. Overall, the book has a wealth of helpful information."
5,Oldie but Goodie,"This was a required book for one of my college courses a hundred years ago. Out of all the college books I ended up keeping, this goes on the top of the list.This is a necessary book for anyone writing anything.As an advanced freelance writer, I still refer to it from time to time, and probably always will."
2,School,I did not like this purchase because I was sent a book made specifically for a different university than my own.
3,Worn and torn,The book I received is really old and looks like its about to fall apart. I guess I'll just have to deal with it and get through the semester.
4,A happy customer,I received the book in a timely manner and happy with the condition. Definitely will order from this seller again.Trong
4,great book worth adding,"with close to a thousand pages you will have plenty of good writing material to use for reference to help you write very accurate and properly designed papers, letters, or whatever you are creating.I was disappointed by the lack of electronic format especially for a book which puts out a new revision almost every year, but I would even go so far as to say that it is worth bringing along if you plan to do a lot of writing anyhow."
4,A wonderful tool for students of all ages!,"The Little, Brown Handbook is a great tool for anyone who has problems with grammer. I found the layout to be very helpful in quickly locating information on a specific grammer question/ problem. The information on MLA format was also very insightfull, and it saved me from making common mistakes on several occasions. I recommend this tool to all college students!"
5,"The BEST grammar book, ever","Really terrific grammar book. If you ever had a grammar question, it's answered in these pages. Get it and turn your writing to an 11."
5,Great book,"This book was so hard to find. I don't know why I didn't go to Amazon first. Anywhos, Amazon had this book readily available and it was shipped in ""almost"" new condition and I received it within a weeks time. Great service and great product!"
4,Everything you should have retained from English Class,"Book is a bit pricey but worth it for editing and reviewing, formatted in an easy to read format, packed with details."
4,Gotta Get Filled!,"Great book on the role of the Holy Spirit. Learned a ton about walking in the Spirit. Roy Hession does a brilliant job keeping ""the main thing the main thing"" without going down a trail to divide people on the work of the Holy Spirit! A must read."
4,WHEN BOND WAS YOUNG,"There was a time when the James Bond movies were directed by real directors and not by the special effects team or a bunch of stuntmen. Yes ! And, at that time, there was a great actor who played James Bond, a no-name guy who'll become Sean Connery. There was no need, then, of endless explosions or multiple gunfights to please the audience. DR NO is terrific, fast and should be showed to all these new directors who believe that they have to destroy seventy cars while filming a car chase. In one word, this movie is refreshing. A DVD for Sean and Ursula fans."
4,Dr. No Blu-Ray DVD,"The Dr. No Blu-Ray DVD worked as promised and the color, sound and music makes it a DVD to keep for your collection so that the Grand Children can see and hear what I mean when I say that Sean Connery was and is still the best James Bond ever!"
3,Pretty good,"I am sorry to say that although I enjoyed this film a lot, there are other Bonds I enjoyed more. However, this film is definitely worth seeing, if not owning, because it set the tone for all the Bonds to come. It does have a great villain (Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No)."
4,Great picture quality,"The pic. quality of the 007 Blue-Rays are awesome!! When the films were cleaned up for DVDs they looked real good , but Blue-Ray made them look truly great!!"
4,Bond makes sound debut in 60's spy classic,"Dr. No was the first Bond film that made it on to the big screen, the makers of this movie never thought in their wildest dreams that Bond would become possibly the most successful franchise of all time.The makers worked closely with Ian Fleming, the author of the actual book Dr. No and as a result you have an authentic spy thriller.Dr. No may not have the fantastic special effects budget bestowed upon the later follow ups, and it makes up for it with a compelling story, and some memorable scenes including Bond at the Casino in the beginning and his collection from the airport.It is all magical stuff which the Bond films of the 70's never managed to match.An absolute must buy!"
4,"Connery, Sean Connery","Bond....James Bond. The words that immortalised one of cinema's best action characters, Sean Connery (and his 'velvet' women) blast onto the screen in the first Bond movie. Approaching the role with all the style and panache that the character in Ian Flemming's novels had, Connery is on a mission in the Bahamas, where he and the sultry Ursula Andress join to uncover the dark secrets of Dr NO. The film itself is not perfect (the slender budget shows particuarly in th middle section) but when Connery's on screen, you simply sit back, and watch the movie that started it all...."
4,Great entry in the Bond series,"Starring Sean Connery, Dr. No takes us back to the days of James Bond where he had to rely on spying and wit to overcome obstacles. The movie has an excellent plot aided by a great villain and great scenery from Jamaica. Sean Connery, though not completely sure of himself in his role, manages to do an excellent job as the suave spy. This movie is an absolute must have for any true Bond-o-phile, don't even bother renting it first. Hardcore action fans, however, may not enjoy this as much."
4,"Bond, James Bond","Back in 1962, nobody could possibly have guessed what a success the James Bond movies would become, and Bond's cinematic debute reflects that. Dr. No is a movie that relies largely on plot, dialogue and character rather than action and gadgetry, which would become the hallmarks of the series later on. The plot, which focuses around a Chinese megalomaniac called Dr. No disrupting the US Space Program, doesn't strive for the heights, but perfectly acheives what it does aim for. The cast delivers good performances, even though some of the characters aren't that interesting. Overall, it's a good start to the series, even though it would be totally overshadowed by the next two."
1,Dr No,This product is defective. It stops in the middle and I have to skip to the next section in order for it to continue
1,Extremely slow,"This movie, is extremely slow. There's a ""Three Blind Mice"" song at the begining, can you believe that! The reason I gave this one star is because of Sean Connery's superb acting."
4,My all time favorite Bond film,"I would recommend this film to all the James Bond fans out there. I loved watching this film over and over again when I was young, and I still watch it today."
4,Excellent transfer of a classic film!,"Dr. No, the original James Bond film with Sean Connery is a classic. Quality entertainment, if not necessarily a ""great"" film.The more relevant feature to this review is the quality of the BD transfer. It is amply evident that producers went to great lengths to ensure a top quality production for this blu-ray disc. The colors are vibrant and clear, and though the BD exceeds the absolute resolution of the original film stock, and thus one can see the grain, the picture is always crisp and pleasing to the eye. Audio too is clear, though it can hardly compare to the best new BDs. All in all, a worthwhile upgrade from the DVD, if such things matter to you."
4,The second best James Bond movie of all - with the best James Bond!,"Hawai'i Five-0 fans will be proud of the futureSteve McGarrett (Jack Lord) in here. For thebest James Bond movie, I nominate ""For HerMagesty's Secret Service"" [critics call itthe ""Best James Bond movie, with the worstJames Bond"", not fair to George Lazenby, whoalso played in Hawai'i Five-0 latter, in anepisode called, ""Year of the Horse""...""...Pure Boogie, baby!""..."
5,Amazing improvement to picture quality with Ultimate Edition DVDs,"I've started replacing all of my older Bond DVDs with these remastered Ultimate Edition versions. The difference in picture quality is remarkable. The older versions are grainy and the color is somewhat washed out. In comparison, the new ones look like they were just filmed. The colors are vivid and the picture is sharp and clear. I just wish that I hadn't invested so much money in Bond DVDs before these were released."
5,Dr.No is a must buy!,"Dr.No is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made inthe bond series, and aslo the first. It has a great storyboard, greataction, and lots of suspense and there are no fancy gadget from Q in this movie, that shows you that James Bond doesn't need small fancy gadget to help him fight the bad guys. Five stars for Dr.No.Dr.No is about a crazy man called, oddly, Dr.No who wants to divert rockets from Cape Canaveral and James Bond 007 is the only one for the job . . .If your going to buy a James Bond movie, buy Dr.No."
2,THOUGH IT STARTED THE PHENOMENA. SAY NO TO THE DR.,"Being a James Bond fan for over 20 years I view each installment with an impartial eye. Although Dr. No began the series it pales in comparison to the subsequent films. All 007 movies are approx. 2 hrs. long. Dr. No is one of the few that feel that long when viewing. This film is drawn out, lacluster and out right boring.Furthermore, Sean Connery is a pathetic actor. Much like Al Gore his persona and performance is robot like. Besides that, he's Scottish. Why in Gods name would he even be an option when casting. He can't even imitate a proper British accent. ... Just because an actor has had a long career does'nt necessarily mean he is talented. For Example: Kevin Costner"
2,So-so,"I'm a very big bond fan. Since dr. no is the first oo7 flick, you'd think it'd have all of james bond's trademarks- fascinating villians, beautiful girls, exciting chase scenes, cool gadgets, and the inevitable twist-in-the-plot. But strangely, this movie is a pale shadow of the others. The caracters seem under-developed and you hardly get to know the villain. What is more, the antagonist doesn't really seem that cruel, which I think is quite important in a movie like this. Long story short, if you want some classic james bond films, try renting thunderball or goldfinger."
3,Thought to British,I thought this movie was way to British for an American film. Also another reason why I only gave three stars was because the movie had no action! Thank god the movie makers completly turned the tables in From Russia w/ Love!
4,A great start to the greatest film series ever.,"Although this is not one of my favorite Bond movies, I still love it. Dr. No is one of the best bad guys of any movie, not just 007. Quarrel is the coolest Bond ally. Plus, its amazing that with the tiny budget that they had to make it, it turned into such a huge movie and franchise. I would recommend this to anyone, but if you just want to see the best, get Goldfinger."
5,Dr No Blu-Ray,"As a 007 and Sean Connery fan, I've seen Dr No several times and it's as timeless and action-filled as ever, so this is really more a review of the movie itself because I saw no discernable difference between the Blu-Ray version and the regular DVD. Connery got the action-adventure genre rolling with this movie and the storyline would be just in place today as it was in 1962. To me, there's only one Bond, and that's Sean."
3,The First James Bond Movie???,"OK, I know this movie was made in 1962, but it was very slow. There was little action and no Bad-guy sidekick. You don't even know Dr. No and then he dies. I'm still confused on HOW he dies. And plus, he's only in it for like 20 minutes. If you want a Bond movie with action and adventure check out:Goldfinger, The Man With the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonaker, and Goldeneye."
3,Dr. No (1962),"Synopsis: An MI-6 agent named John Strangways is shot dead by some men posing as blind people, and soon his secretary's gunned too. James Bond is sent to Jamaica and find out that a man named Dr. No is planning to topple the US space program. Along with a shell sellaer named Honey Ryder, Bond must stop Dr. No.Review: This is the very first Bond flick ever to be made. This is also the first one I've (fully, I've seen some of From Russia With Love and Licence To Kill, plus the end of Live And Let Die) seen. But at times, this movie's really boring. The sound of gun shots in this film is cheap, and we barely even get to know Honey Ryder OR Dr. No. In conclusion, this film's okay."
2,Dr. No Action,"This is the driest James Bond movie everz! If you see the movies with James Bond for action, see a newer one. The best part is when the lady gets shot, and that's in the beginning, so don't see the rest. It wont keep you on your seat, you'll get up and leave to go to the bathroom every 5 minutes. See the beginnig then shut the dang tv off!"
4,An Oldie but Goodie!,"This is the original Sean Connery (James Bond) film. Movie making technology and techniques have improved over the last 50 years. However, this film set a standard and established a new genre of film. It's a great excape and an opportunity to relish both the past and the present. Sean Connery was and still is a wonderful James Bond."
3,magilla gorilla,i didn't mind the grainy films (that's what we grew up with on channel 11). i had a problem warner brothers NOT putting the theme song. how could they do such a stupid thing. hopefully they'll make another magilla set & recall this 1.
1,STOP! Do not buy! False Ad,"If you think you are going to get the complete series with theme song and end credits along with Ricochet Rabbit and Mush mouse and Punk-in Puss along with Magilla Gorilla you will be disappointed there is only Magilla cartoons all of them, the title Magilla Gorilla Complete series may be Leagley correct but ethically and for us collectors it is completely wrong. Shame on Warner Brothers."
3,Good Old Cartoons,I think the old cartoons are great and love showing them to my kids. I was particularly looking for Breezley and Sneezley (which I read was on these dvd's) and have yet to see one on there. So I am a bit disappointed. But if I was looking specifically for all the rest it is great.
3,Customer service a little slow,"When I received this item, one of the discs had a big scratch, I e-mailed the seller several times, after over a week no response, I finally had to go through Amazon, I finally heard back, I was able to send it back and get a replacement, which came back in great condition."
1,Warner Home Video admits they goofed!,"Yes, Warner Home Video has admitted that they goofed, they forgot the opening & closing titles that has the famous theme song! They also forgot the in-between bridging material that introduced the next cartoon. Then there is the fair quality film transfer of the cartoons. No restoration here!Warner Home Video MAY re-master the discs IF there is a demand for it. I say demand it!After the exceptional DVD releases on Yogi Bear & Huckleberry Hound, this is a real let down."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"I so looked forward to getting this. I love the Hanna Barbera cartoons; they take me back to my childhood. I am, however dissappointed in this set.If you purchase DVDs based on customer reviews then take heed. Some of the cartoons are kind of fuzzy and the theme song is missing! How could they not have noticed that?Maybe I should have listened to the reviewer that said this is just for kids, they wouldn't know any better."
1,BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"From all the reviews I have read concerning this release it does'nt even deserve 1 star. I'm not talking about the cartoons , the cartoons themselves are all classic,I'm talking about the HORRIBLE transfers and the fact that they DID NOT include the opening and closing themes. I would buy this but the price would have to come down a lot because this is not a quality effort put into the release of this product. If there is not a re-release then I guess I will be stuck with this unacceptable version of this release , but first the price must come down."
1,NO THEME??!!,"I was really looking forward to getting this set and sharing it with my young niece and nephew --- not to mention being taken back to my own childhood. Like most other reviewers, I am disappointed in this set.I can deal with the fuzzy cartoons --- but I can't believe they left off the opening and closing credits with the theme song :(((((( How and why would they do that??It would have been nice to see my niece and nephew singing along with the catchy theme song ... oh well."
1,EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SERIE IS NOT A CONPLETE SERIE,"THIS SERIE, IS MISSING THE OPENING,& CLOSING THEME SONGS OF EVERY EPISODA OF THE SERIES. THE WAY THE CARTOONS WERE IN ORDER, WERE, ( 1 ) MAGILLA GORILLA, THEN FOLLEWED BY, ( 2 ) MUCHMOUSE & PUMKIN' PUSS, THEN LASTLY FOLLOWED BY, ( 3 ) RICOCHET RABBIT,& DROOP-A-LONG. THIS DVD HAS IT AS, ( 1 ) MAGILLA GORILLA, THEN ( 2 ) RICOCHET RABBIT & DROOP-A-LONG, THEN,( 3 ) MUSTMOUSE & PUNKIN'PUSS. AND TO PROOF IT, IF THEY HAD THE OPENING, THEME SONG AND CREDIT YOU WOULD SEE MAGILLA GORILLA, ANNOUNING THEM ON THE SHOW, IN ORDER, OF APPEARESTING, SO MAYBE THAT WHY THE MAGILLA GORILLA, THEME SONG IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF EACH EPISODA ? THANKS THE T.V. MAN"
4,Highly recommened,"Good copy, brought back memories of the television series. Worth the money and delivered in good time."
3,usefull small circuits and drawings of power supp & optics,"usefull small circuits and drawings of power supp of high voltage for lasers,drivers ,optics etc.. a lot of mechanical drawings and optics \lens placement for holografy, and other interesting exp, the book is more cw lasers and not at all pulser solid state , not include eny diode or new solid state power lasers. even i would not call it profesionall or advanced , i still recomand to buy and have this book ."
2,My Cats Find this Repellent,"This product has long gone to waste on my cabinet of cat treats and nutrition supplements.Like the others reviewing this fur ball digestive aid, my cats wouldn't eat their food once this ""gravy"" was added. They sniffed at it and walked away.I was sure that with time and patience, my cats would accept and maybe even like the taste of it. That never happened.Unlike some nutritional preparations like NutriCal, this product just isn't paletable to cats.I should have read these reviews before my purchase."
1,Broke down quickly...,"There is a tiny rotary pump blade in the head of the device. The pump itself was fine as long as it lasted, but then the tiny pump blade part separated from the shaft. No problem... I easily took it apart in order to reinstall the pump blades. Unfortunately the tiny part cracked during repair and so far I cannot find a replacement part. Looks like a the pump should include a couple of spare blades... was sort of hoping I would somehow find the part based on this review. I planned to used it to drain my two generators and a high pressure water sprayer to keep the gas fresh. I only got one use out of it though. Geo"
3,Siphon Pump,"Battery Siphon PumpWorks good, would like for it to have a little more power, but it does the job."
3,not what the picture shows.,I purchased this item because the picture shows a pump like I used to have. The pump I actually received had the wide pump end. It barely fits through the opening of the gas cans. The plastic end on our old pump came off when we pulled it back out of the opening. They need to update their photo to show you what you really are getting.
3,PLEASE NOTE - CAME IN FIVE FOOT SECTIONS,"I ordered 25' and the hose came in five individual cut pieces in five foot lengths. For my application, it was OK but if you need 25' of continuous hose, you may need to look elsewhere."
5,Only tubing to use,I custom built my water cooled system 4 years ago. While upgrading MB and video I replaced the first Tygon tubing I used which was 3/8 by 5/8. It obviously worked great with no leaks and no kinks. I chose 3/8 by 9/16 this time for easier routing and less cost. It works just as well and I have no issues with kinking.
2,Soft tubing that kinks easily,The first thing I noticed when this tubing arrived is that it is very soft and not kink-resistant. When comparing to regular vinyl tubing this product would kink at larger angles more easily. Also it discolored from antifreeze being run through it. I was surprised that Tygon tubing is such an inferior product as I have heard positive things about it.
5,A Study Of The Anti-Federalist In Their Own Right,"In this insightful work, Duncan clearly delineates between the concerns and priorities of Publius (The Federalists) and the concerns/priorities of the Anti-Federalists (who were technically in a manner of speaking the true-genuine ""federalists"") as expressed through key passages of their various tracts during the framing. This work also provides a significant alternative to the ""straussian school of american political thought"" regarding the framing which in general, has too easily dismissed the ""historical context"" in which the Anti-Federalists thought and wrote. Duncan's discussion of the Anti-Federalists' ancestral ties to early american (New England) communal puritanism provides an interesting contrast to straussian Michael Zuckert's exposition on the transformation of (New England) american puritanism in his book""The Natural Rights Republic.""Eric B Martin"
5,Great,"Got this from amazon so I could get a better deal. Saved a lot of money, great book. Nice quality"
1,Horrible,"Another completely horrible, pointless book. I disgrace myself please do not buy this book!"
5,Waking up your ears,"I've been a serious jazz fan since the 1970's, but this CD set has made me realize that my collection is lacking in the work of some really cool players--like Don Byas and Archie Shepp. Everything in this collection is well worth listening to. The Lester Young cuts are ones that I've never heard before. The Sonny Stitt is some of his most soaring and Bird-like. I love the fact that Lee Konitz is included here, playing magnificently in a small band setting. And the fact that I've now got this all together in one set is very satisfying--worth much more than I paid for it. Now I want to buy several more sets for friends. I'm delighted with it and upset that it has been discontinued. Why??? If you can, get it now!"
4,Not quite as good as the other titles,"Folks looking for the same full-instrument transcribed scores as the previous scores Hal Leonard released are going to be a little disappointed. When the previous reviewer says the piano parts get a little sparse, he means it, and unfortunately unlike in the previous books, you can't turn to the lines of other instruments for fill-inspiration. This also means it's a heck-of-a-lot easier to play than the other books (maybe this is a good thing for you?)Still, it's Ben Folds, who pwnz all things piano and the piano ballads (Luckiest, Fred Jones Pt. 2) are sure to please."
5,Great Book if you want to sing/play Ben Folds,The book is great -- now I just wish I had 4 other musicians to make it sound more like the CD.
4,"Great stuff, but I agree with the other reviews","Just like the other reviews said, it's great music but the repeats are a pain. Worth buying if you're a big fan, but be prepared to have to really sit down and figure out the ""roadmap"" of the music, between repeats, first and second endings, codas, etc. For me it was worth the investment but I'm glad I was warned about this or I'd have gotten frustrated."
5,Best seller!,"I ordered the book with full payment. However, something went wrong with the shipping weight and I contacted the seller about the problem. He replied very quickly and gave me refund for the extra weight in a very friendly manner. I really enjoy the book and the way this seller communicates!"
5,"Concise, timely and humorous description of OS technology","The revision, like the Original is fresh and engaging - offering complex technical concepts in bite sized, palatable parcels.Mr. Pfister has done something wonderful for the computer industry with this book. The term clustering has been miss used and miss understood, often with drastic consquences, since Digtal released VMS V4.0 (and within clustering) and UNIX vendors tried to copy it.Greg Pfister has done a level set, defining terms and concepts and than comparing each implementation's strengths and weaknesses with a unique blend of clarity and humor.I recommend this book for 3 camps: I consider it classic example of how to write a technical book, it is helpful for anyone wanting to develop or exploit reliable systems and it is a must read for folks considering or already involved with NT server Enterprise Edition."
3,No longer relevant,"I wish there would be a book like this with today's (2011) perspective. The world has changed and unfortunately this book has become a history book.The book was written before SMP became ubiquitous, before virtual machines with massive multi-threading, before application servers with clustering, before widespread use of web technologies.But it provides an interesting history of HW based clustering, clustered batch processing and scientific parallel processing capabilities."
1,"NO, NO, NO, BADLY WRITTEN","I had high expectations for this book, and was terribly disappointed. It is poorly written. The author has a pretentious way of writing."
2,Naoki Kenji - Tozai,"Naoki Kenji, better known for his ambient releases on Elektrolux, tries his hand at atmospheric drum 'n' bass on TOZAI. And while the music is pleasant enough (like the jazz in outer space of ""Cyber Spies""), the general niceness really lends itself towards blandness, and Kenji doesn't quite overcome this. ""Spaceship Earth"" utilitizes samples from the moon landing -- a techno cliché at this point. So do we need further launch countdowns on ""Discovery Launch?"" ""Dimension"" lets the rhythm get a little more aggressive, but nothing that would get you too worked up. Alas."
4,All you ever wanted to know about the beginnings of communism PLUS!,"This is a scholarly book that names specific persons, location, and dates in the gradual move through Russian history of the last two Czars. It does not read quite like a novel, yet the author does his best to keep a sort of plot going. There is way too much here for a quick read; it has too many details for that. It seems authoritative and free of bias."
3,emotionally exhausting read,Without going into the details of the story line I will say that I found it interesting but did feel very emotionally exhausted by the end of the read. Explicit sex scenes did not add value but seemed to lend a bit of trashiness to an otherwise okay book.
5,Excellent,"At first I thought this book was hard to follow, but turned out a really good read. Heart warming and full of love. I really enjoyed it."
4,loved it,"I really enjoyed this book. It's the second book by Hannah I have read and she has a way of writing that sucks you in and you get invested in the characters' lives. Excellent book!It was so much more than a book about sisters. It was about relationships and heartbreak, and love and joy. It was great and heartwarming. I definitely fought back tears during some parts. I don't have sisters (or brothers) but it made me think about the other relationships I have in my life and how special they are."
4,Wonderful story,This was a wonderful story about the bonds of sisterhood. For anyone that has had or does have a sister it is a powerful reminder how special that relationship is.
4,RandylJ,Another great read by Kristin Hannah. This endearing and mildly philosophical tale about two sisters learning tolerance and opening their hearts was well written as are her other very entertaining novels. I rated it less than perfect only because I had wanted the soft cover and received a very nice hard cover edition instead and because my favorite Kristin Hannah story remains Summer Island. RandylJ
3,Good book but a little unbelivable,"Well the rest of the reviewers have told you the plot premise. It was an ok read. I have enjoyed Hannah's other books much more. As a health professional, the medical scene were a bit far fetched and that was very distracting for me. Won't recommend it to others."
2,Soap Opera Novel,"This book is written like a trashy romance novel or a written soap opera. It has really unbelievable, predictable characters and cliche situations. It was compelling but the plot and writing caused me to roll my eyes several times. I read it for a book club and most of us thought it was bad. I did finish it. It wasn't so terrible that I put it down but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Romance novel,"I have read other books by this author and enjoyed some of them. This was not one of those. The plot is simplistic and predictable. Happy endings all around. If that's the type of book you enjoy, by all means go for it. Otherwise, skip this one. It's not worth the effort you will expend turning the pages."
4,Enjoyable Reading,"I read this book for our local book club. I am not usually a reader of books like this, but I don't avoid them. I would have liked the characters to have been a little more developed. The script was somewhat predictable. I always knew that things would be OK in the end. I hoped it wouldn't have been so ""happily ever after,"" but all-in-all, a pretty good read."
4,Between sisters,This is a feel good read...and proves that the bonds of sisterhood stretch but never break :) I loved it.
4,Between Sisters,I always have liked Kristin Hannah but I had issues getting into this book.....I had several starts before I could finish it. I would recommend it because sometimes it is just me not the book.
3,Between Sisters,"This is my second Kristin Hannah. The first one I read was Winter Garden and it was depressing, so I skeptical about this book. It started out slow, but I thought it just kept getting better. This renewed my optimism in reading another Kristin Hannah book."
2,Kristin Hannah,Not exactly my favorite author. Well written and loved by many readers. If you love her work you will like this book.
4,Hannah books,Have read alot of Kristen Hannah books and I am never disappointed. This one tugs at the heart strings. Couldn't wait to get back to it as each chapter makes you want to go the next right away.
2,Pretty mundane reading,Kristin Hannah is a good writer. Her characters are well developed and her books are very readable. This book was just plain boring and contrived. If I hadn't read other of her book I would never read another based on this one.
3,"Good, but predictable","This book was enjoyable, and had a lot of potential, but I really felt that it was predictable and expected. The story was sweet, and entwined, but not really novel in any way. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't recommend it as a favorite."
5,Warm and Endearing,I really liked this story. Enjoyed Joe's part and Meghan and Claire's parts as well. Also I was so hooked on the end wondering what was going to happen. Will be reading more Kristin Hannah soon :)
1,This lock is very easy to pick,"This lock can be defeated easily in 2 ways:1. Using a lighter to melt the plastic and the bending the outer cable back on itself to reveal the inner cable which can then be cut.2. Shoving a small shim (fashioned from a soda can) into the lock to reveal the combination.Here's a link describing the 2 vulnerabilities and videos showing how to do it: http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/08/the-lockdown-your-new-targus-defcon-cl-lock-hacked-by-beer/This product lacks a ""reasonable"" measure of security that is most consumers would expect when purchasing."
1,lock loses combination,"I bought two of these a few days ago. One is working fine (so far) but the other one has already lost its (default) combination of 0000 and is now permanently affixed to one of my workstations. A quick search shows that this lock can be easily compromised in minutes, so I will have to resort to that. I should have checked here first, but it seems like the local stores only carry this one brand - pure crap!"
2,Coby Vertical System,"Looks nice except the speaks are shoddy--really cheap-looking. I ended up using my old ones from a Brookstone vertical whose main unit broke. This unit makes background noise--a friend said it's probably because it has cheap transistors. Mostly noticeable when volume is low. Also, the remote doesn't work right--sometimes I have to press buttons two or three times. I guess you ultimately get what you pay for. I loved the broken Brookstone I'd had for years for $250, but it's now about $400. The Brookstone had a better design, as on this one the radio and buttons are on the bottom--makes more sense to have them on the top where you can see them. Also has no clock."
4,Wodehose at his usual excellent clip - plot summary,"Things get hairy when it's discovered that a peer and a barber were Switched At Birth. Now that they're grown up, is it too late to switch them back?"
5,"Kicker CVT ""S","Never had a problem with Kicker CVT's this is my second pair, I think to ship them to me was expensive it wasn't a great deal after all."
3,I Really Wanted To Like This,"I really wanted to like this DVD, but it's just too slow and boring. I have forced myself and my 2 and a half year old daughter to watch this multiple times and we love the dogs, but the whole thing is almost creepy. The narrator's voice is monotone and the script/storyline is odd. My daughter, who will sit through anything with animals in it, gets bored and walks away. I would save my money or buy 101 Dalmations (the animated one)."
5,"Beautiful Songs, Beautifully Sung","To put it simply, this is music to dream, slow-dance, kiss, swoon, cuddle, cry or make love to.Jo Stafford is one of the most underrated vocalistsin any genre, and this CD shows why. If you'rea fan of Mariah, Christina, Celine, or any of theother charter members of ""Oversingers Anonymous"",this probably isn't for you. Any other music fanwith a heart, soul and two working ears will loveit. ""Something To Remember You By"" is sublime!Go ahead, treat yourself to JO!"
1,THIS IS NOT THE JO STAFFORD CD THAT I HAD HOPED FOR.,I HAVE MANY JO STAFFORD CDS IN MY COLLECTION. THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST OF ALL MY CDS OF HERS. IT SEEMS PAUL WESTON HER ARRANGER REALLY MISSED THE MARK ON HIS ARRANGEMENTS. OUT OF THE 15 SONGS LISTED I ONLY LIKED 2.
1,Save your money,"So cheaply manufactured it pulled apart when I tried to unplug it AND you have to pay return postage, to return it, in order to get your refund."
1,A Nice Wooden Box,"I opened this amp and the circuitry consisted of one opamp, a volume control, and an LED. The wallwort ""power supply"" is very cheap. How Grado came up with a $425 price is beyond me. The mahogany box has to be the most expensive part. I was surprised a reputable company like Grado would try to pass off this piece of junk. Keep looking."
4,funny!!,"This album will not be remembered as one of the best in reggae music, sure, but it's really fun and if you are looking for some to ease your mind this could be the right one, i really like it, it's like a sunny day. ""Magic woman"" and ""Sarah"" are my favourite songs, but the whole album is really cool and relaxing. ""Jim Jam"" is a soca tune, and ""Party"" a dancehall track. There is also an hip hop version of ""I need a roof"", but don't worry, this is a roots reggae album."
5,Another winner by Pat Barker,"Ms. Barker is one of my favorite fiction writers. Her books are in a special pantheon for me, as I am not a heavy fiction reader.I won't give a detailed review of the plot, as this would make me a ""spoiler"".Although this is not a long family chronicle, the startling link of past and present is quite powerful.Highly recommended!"
4,Moving,"A moving, beautifully written novel that serves as an interesting addendum to the Regeneration trilogy. Barker is a fine novelist and shines here."
2,thin lizzy...,"I cannot quite comprehend how this little read provokes the above adoring ratings except, perhaps, as remembered tribute to the oft mentioned Trilogy of the same author. Either that or some folks have been on a calorie poor diet of prose of recent. Like a few others, I found this a let-down, thinly written and not terribly convincing either in characterization or in point. It's almost as if she were in a hurry to tell about something, not quite having the time to decide what. Throwing together a number of high profile dramatic elements along with a collection of overwrought characters does not a story make. To each their own, I suppose. I vote for passing on."
2,Not a good book,"This is a funny book, not that it is funny though! But reading it I was wondering - What kind of book is this? There is a ghost in it, so I thought maybe it is ghost story? But not really. Then there is also a story about a boy, Gareth, who is jealous upon the smaller boy in the family, Jasper, which is the shared child of his mothers new husband, Gareth's own father has broken the connection. So Gareth feels left out of the family and exerts pretty serious violent actions upon Jasper, so I thought then is then a psycho drama? But not really either. Then there is an old 1WW veteran who are dying Geordie. The book takes place in the 1990. What strikes me about the book is that the author is not afraid of decribing some of the tabuised areas of physical life. Things like the gentials, excrement and she even describes an intercourse with a highly pregnant woman."
3,Intense but incomplete,"The author does a wonderful job describing the atmosphere and the emotions of the characters but leaves out too much detail. The main story about grandson and grandfather is very touching, and felt authentic but so much was left unclear. The secondary story that centers on the grandson and his blended family was very incomplete. Things were wrapped up too quickly. This novel left me with several unanswered questions and a vague feeling that I've been lured into reading a sequel."
3,Disappointing,"This novel seemed more like a sketch of a novel than a fully realized work. Barker, the author of the outstanding Regeneration trilogy, employs several devices of 19th century fiction, including a haunted house, to develop a story of sibling love/hate and the imprisoning effects of traumatic memories. In comparison with her prior work, I found the characterizations thin and the plotting somewhat contrived. Nor does this novel contain any of the virtuoso passages that particularly characterized the last novel in the Regeneration trilogy, The Ghost Road. Fans of Barker should skip this work and wait for her next novel."
1,Not so good,"I figured out what happened between Geordie and his brother but kept reading to see how it would come to light. For the most part, the characters are annoying: Nick is a wuss, Fran needs her tubes tied, Gareth needs to be sent away to military school...I can't see the appeal of this book."
4,"Solid, reliable product","It's an extended run battery, large enough to alter the balance of the camera. Does this job with no fuss, charges quickly."
1,Nonfunctioning DVD,"I paid Amazon $20.00 for a new DVD--this dance one. The DVD does not work. I am really unable to determine if I like it, because I can't see more than a minute of the DVD before it sticks. I am very disappointed with Amazon and the seller of this product."
3,Excellent on the outside. So so on the inside.,The book arrived soon after purchase. It was in pristine condition. The content reads like it is the author's doctoral thesis.
3,What were they thinking...,I am a huge Renaissance fan. They played a form of music that was unique and they played it very well. So what were they thinking when they put out this album. Did they think we were all tired of hearing John Tout's piano? They must have because it isn't to be found on this album. Did they think we were tired of hearing what is probably the best female vocal in pop music? Did they really think Jon Camp could sing?Renaissance had a small but very loyal following in the seventies. They did that based on a formula of progressive folk/rock/clasical music played at it's very best. Unfortunately this album isn't it. I guess they kind of got tired of the successfull formula.What were they thinking...
2,2.5 stars,"After the deathly serious ""Novella,"" Renaissance returned with a noble, but ultimately uneven effort in ""A Song For All Seasons.""Interestingly the albums two strongest tracks were songs that oozed mainstream pop appeal. ""Back Home Once Again,"" and the catchy as all get out ""Northern Lights"" were concise and memorable songs that should have been huge hit singles (""Northern Lights"" was a top ten single in England) and could have brought the band a wider audience had things worked out right.The rest of the album is a mixed bag and like its predecessor ""Novella"" has some pleasant moments, but ones that fall far short of the groups ""Turn of the Cards,"" and ""Scheherzade"" heyday.2.5 stars."
3,"not their best, but still decent","This is a step down from Renaissance's early work. Most of the songs are more pop-oriented. Still, a couple of songs stand out as good examples of the progressive genre, including the title track and the opening track. The best known track, ""Northern Lights"", is pure ear candy, but it is good listening just the same."
2,"Yuck - dull, uninspired","Now I remember why I didn't fret when I lost the LP version of this disk. Renaissance has made terrific music, but this outing isn't among their better efforts. Everyone sounds out of energy and there's no overarching theme or unity of direction to tie things together. Check out the band's other fine disks."
1,"Addressing ""remastered"" audio quality only: it STINKS!!!","I've been looking for a good remaster of this excellent album for a long time. The Wounded Bird release offered here is NOT it. It sounds like a cassette copied to CD, with no attempt to improve the sound.Maybe the master tapes for this recording are really that poor. I don't know. But to advertise this as ""original recording remastered"" is a disgrace."
3,Ballad Soulful Grove....,"If you looking for a pop ballad but also feels gospel with a splash of funk, then you've herd PEYTON...This cd is great if you use to like early 90's pop ballads but now mixed with an authentic Hed Kandi spice....My favourites are:Loves Going On, I'll Rise, Miracles, Keep The Faith, A Little Sensitivity and (my favourite) .......FIND MY WAY.........This CD is a sensational winter warmer... Try it! :)"
1,Boyoboy is this bad!,"I bought this for my husband who thought it would be a laugh, we are both singers and also play a lot of music. However I listened to this CD and thought it was utterly dreadful, not at all funny, just dreadful. My husband is in two minds about it, but has only listened to part of it once! So I think that says it all. Therefore I would not recommend this CD."
5,A family favorite.,The very talented artists Jonathan and Darlene Edwards have been a favorite of my family's for years. I was thrilled to find a cd version of the old vinyl versions I have.
1,"Brush is not motorized, relies on suction to spin...forget it","If you want something that has a spinning brush, take this off your list, poor design. The brush is powered by the suction of the vacuum, so when the filter gets dirty the brush speed decreases...to not turning. However the overall suction is very powerful, so anything related to just sucking up dirt/crumbs is great."
2,Not all its cracked up to be,"I expected more from this corded mini vac after reading the reviews. The filter cleaning/emptying/replacements are a joke and the capacity is non-existent. The ""power"" scrubber lose power after a minute because the vacuum is almost full....bottom line, I regret making this purchase."
1,junk!,Very possiby the biggest waste of money ever! The cord gets stuck into the suction and makes for easy and quick use impossible. The nozzle for narrow spaces won't stay open and the whole thing is heavy and bulky - very sorry I purchased this!
3,"Well, it could be better.","I understand several things about vacuum cleaners:a good vacuum cleaner should have:1) excellent suction;2) good ventilation and cooling system;3) medium noise level;4) be convenient in handling;5) look pleasant to the eye;6) have all the necessary attachments.This vacuum cleaner has the following:1) it has a good suction; but when I apply attachments to the nozzle, its suction decreases;2) it has too strong ventilation. It ""blows me"" away! After cleaning, my room has a specific odor.3)it is extremely noisy. I have never had such a noisy vacuum cleaner in my life. I have to wear ear protection. However, it may be because the VC is small and a person has to hold it too close to the upper part of the body. That's why it may seem so.4) it is very convenient!!!5) it is Beautiful;6) I do not like its brush. It makes suction weaker. The brush bristle could be flatter."
3,Not that great for more than 5 stairs at a time.,"I'm sorry to say I am not that pleased with this vacuum. I bought it because I have a once a week cleaning job, the person I am cleaning for had a heavy upright that was not effective for the job. I bought the dirt devil scorpion for the stairs, there are over 20 stairs. After about 4-5 stairs the filter gets clogged which makes the turbo brush stop spinning. I then have to take the filter out and vacuume it with the big vacuum. Very time consuming. Otherwise it is a nice little vacuum. But would not recommend for more than 5 stairs or a lot of dust."
5,Great Vacuum,"This was perfect for what we needed, no more piles of dog hair in the corner, the attachments are great"
5,"Wolk's words, your images","This is in many respects one of those universal stories that plays effectively on shared memories. It may have taken place in Maine, but the images that ran through my mind as I read it were of a Boy Scout camp in East Texas. Wish we could have ended each camp session in the Eastwind tradition, but it was not to be. Regardless, I'm in debt to Mr. Wolk for letting me return for one more season."
4,Almost what I was looking for...,"This hat is all right... As with one other hat I reviewed though, it just wasn't what I was looking for specifically..."
3,Great look; not durable at all,"Contrary to the other reviewer, it only took a few sessions of playing with this dinosaur figure before one of the legs broke off. My son plays with a whole group of dinosaur figures, many Carnegie ones, but this one broke very quickly and without being abused in any way. The plastic just fractured."
3,Turned South,"Funny writing, but the story line sure took a downward turn. Why couldn't they keep it appropriate for family viewing? Season 1 went up to ""the line."" Season 2 went over and beyond ""the line."" Too bad."
4,Gorgeous and Unique,I received a gift certificate for my birthday and chose this unique necklace. It is beautiful and graceful. The only problem is that it tends to tilt forward. It is not attached properly to the chain and that is bothersome. People tend to reach over to correct it so they can actually see it.
5,Wonderful Insight,"This book has helped me tremendously. It taught me how to discipline my son with love, and because of this we are closer than ever before. Most of the book is about creating loving relationships with your children, spending quality time with them and smiling on them with joy. Towards the end of the book the subject of discipline is addressed, but in a very healthy, sober way."
3,"A neat idea, but...","...when it comes to this, or any other tv-series-on-DVD multi-season pack, my advice is to do some calculating and comparing because buying each season of a series individually might be a better deal in many cases."
1,Something is wrong with this.,The playser doesn't work. I'm really disappointed. I planned to take it to the dog park and have the dogs run after the light. I've tried everything but it doesn't work!
2,looked like fun,"It came without batteries and I have not purchased batteries to see how it works. Too bad. Seemed like a good idea, but I DO wish it had come with batteries."
5,Doesn't pull any punches...,"Don't read this unless you are able to complete it over one sitting. It's difficult to put down. The author, Michelle, doesn't pull any punches in this book. Infertility is a difficult for any couple. For Carla and Simon, it's no different. It's a story about trust and a committment to love one another through the good and the bad times. The characters reveal thoughts that couples deal with from time to time but would never admit it. It is a story that will keep you thinking after it has ended and cause you to reflect on your own life. I look forward to her future books."
2,Not a good introductive book to java3d starters,"This book has obviously been constructed in a very short time. This is evident in the numerous errors in the included source code (not small errors either). Incorrectly referenced pictures also give this book an extremely slow progression. Fundamental concepts to Java3D are included and documented in a comprehendible manner. Another irritating factor with this book is that a third of the content is source code which can be obtained on the WWW anyway. The authors interpretation of the word 'FAST' is quite simply to rush and make copius errors.Final verdict - Unfortunately the typo's, erroneous fig references and content make this book a bit of a.... A much better book is ""Java 3D Programming"" by Daniel Selman (value for money!). Sorry Ian."
3,Nice introduction,"This is a nice introduction to Java3D. However it is lacking in explaining the more fundamental issues regarding 3D. But then again, this book was not written for that purpose.. Overall a good book to practice 3D programming in Java"
4,"Good Show, Good Service","This package arrived overseas within the time frame stipulated by amazon.com. It was almost immediately opened and viewed. It's great to relive one of the classic family sitcoms of the 80s/early 90s that I grew up with. The kids pick on eachother, the parents try to parent well, and each character progresses throughout the complete series. Good value and good values. Highly recommended. Another good classic, The Cosby Show, give that a try too."
4,"No subtitles, no closed-caption","A very good TV show, but the sound is mediocre. There are no subtitles. And the closed caption feature is nearly impossible to adjust.Where is the closed caption feature? It does not show in the disk menu. It is not under the subtitles feature. The closed-caption in the menu won't work. I had a lot of work to make it work. Only an old DVD-players connected to an old TV displayed Family Ties' closed-captions.Most DVD-players won't show them. If you use a HDMI cable or if your TV is HD or if your DVD-player is modern, closed-captions will probably not display."
4,Quick ideas - not a lot of prep time needed,"These ideas are good for grade school kids and they don't require a lot of time or materials to prepare for. Each activity will only take about 10-15 minutes though, so be prepared if you're planning to fill an hour."
3,Disappointing follow-up,"Maybe its because reading Balmer's ""Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory"" was like reading my own mind that I found ""Blessed Assurance"" a dull read. I got the feeling that the author took several academic essays and made a book out of them. There is still some great information and thought in this book, so it is worth reading. I agree with the author that confessional theology and ideology in general have given way to pragmatism in evangelicalism, but I disagree with his assertion that the general dislike of Hillary Rodham Clinton among Evangelicals is simply because she is a powerful woman. Most evangelicals strongly support powerful women such as Margeret Thatcher, Jean Kirkpatrick, Elizabeth Dole and Laura Schlessinger on ideological grounds. If you've already read ""Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory"" then go ahead and read this book..if not start there."
2,Not very original,"I thought there was some good advice in here, but a warning to all guys; girls know all this and won't be impressed that you do."
3,Much Better Out There,"I was quite disappointed in the book. Although there were the traditional ideas (warm up your honey's car), the creative ideas were few and far between. Not much inspiration here.A much better book I have found is The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb."
5,Contemporary Romance,"Southern Gentlemen is two stories by two wonderful ladies. Jennifer Blake tells the story of John ""Rip"" Peterson, born on the wrong side of the tracks, goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit, and tries to redeem himself when he gets out to win the woman he has loved since childhood. Emilie Richards weaves the tale of Billy Ray Wainright, an attorney in a small southern town, who (naturally) comes to the aid of a damsel in distress. All of us who grew up in Smalltown, USA can relate to these wonderfully written stories."
4,A great writer :),"I read this book in it's spanish edition, and I found it great, Jennifer Blake has always been one of my favorite authors and her works has been always good. The way she presents the characters has always been one of my favorite things about her work, because the regular guys are the ones that always do the right things, and then giving the highborns a lesson :)."
2,"Pleasant, but far from memorable","The disappointing ""Live at Carnige Hall"" seems to be the beginning of the end of Renaissance. The band's unwillingness (or inability) to show a little spontaneity in their note for note reworking of some of their songs suggested that the band was either beginning to run out of ideas, a notion that was sadly confirmed by its follow-up studio effort ""Novella."" The fatal flaw here is that the band seemed to be putting more effort on expanding the orchestral sound that worked so well on their two best albums, ""Turn of the Cards, and ""Scheherazade"" at the expense of writing actual songs. Sadly, ""Novella"" seems almost devoid of melodies that one remembers 20 seconds after the song is over (""The Captive Heart"" comes close). This is all pleasant, competent stuff, but ultimately it is an album that fails to excite."
3,Mapping for Geeks,"I recently went thru half of this book and at first I thought it was a way to create your own maps ala cartography. Which is something I've done for many of my clients using Illustrator to draw the maps and then transferring it over to Fireworks (or sometimes creating the map directly in Fireworks) and then exporting it as a .gif. Not so here. This book shows various ways to use MapQuest, Yahoo and other types of mapping systems you've probably never heard of and learning all sorts of sneaky ways to take these systems to the limit. Probably too geeky for me and maybe a lot of you, but if you want to learn how to take these various mapping systems and sites to the max, this book is for you for sure."
3,Too bad I already knew most of this stuff,"I didn't really get a lot out of this book. I took the title to mean that it had code for online mapping. Not so much. It was kind of fun to browse through, but not what I was looking for at the time. It's one of the reasons I buy most of my books at a bookstore instead of online."
3,It was OK,"It is definitely about a bunch of hacks. There were a few hacks that I was able to use. Hacks wasn't what I was expecting, but for those that need those hacks, it is definitely the book that contains a lot of important hacks in one place. You could probably google most of the information and save a little bit of reading time."
5,pirate pennant,am looking forward to using this at our pirate party! there is enough of it to decorate in different places as well !
5,100 feet of pirate pizzaz,"This product is just as described. The pennants are plastic, but everything held together well. I have no complaints. The 100 feet of decoration worked great along the back fence since we didn't have time to string it up in the living room as I had hoped. If it had hung in the living room I have have been disappointed in that the backs of the pennants are just blank/see-through."
3,So so,"It was worth the price and not worth returning. I wouldn't purchase it again. It is pretty cheap looking, but fine for one time use at a kid's party. It's super thin plastic and the back side is not at all attractive. Pretty sure I saw the same thing at a dollar store the other day."
2,Croatian Propaganda,"Mr. Mestrovic, an ethnic croat, writes a bogus, completely biased account ofthe civil war in Bosnia. He gets plenty of assistence to bash Serbs from a Muslim co-author. He rehashs the tired Zagreb-Sarajevo party line of a ""land grab"" by the serbs and completely ignores the fact that Serbs made up a full 33% of Bosnia before the war. He of course, completely ignores war crimes commnitted by Croats and Muslims against Serb civilians. Also, Mestrovic ignores the role of Croatia in fomenting war amongst the croats and Muslims. A good read for any student of propaganda. A poor work if one is searching for facts."
3,Acceptable,The story moves slowly but with a good twist in the plot. However it didnt keep my atention centered. Vincent Price's talent went to waste on this film.
4,I like it.,The CD was just what I was looking for. It arrived quickly and was well packed. I would recommend it to others.
5,I Loved This Prequel!,"Finally another book by in Koen's 17th Century Europe series, worth the wait. I loved this prequel"
2,Not a Page Turner,"I had heard so much good about this author, but I've read two of her books now (the other Through the Glass) and I can't see the hype. She's overdoes the ""visual"" details. She often goes places that don't affect the plot. Her writing is just heavy. I could hardly force myself to finish the books. In this one, the plot just got silly at the end and I was disappointed in the character."
4,Dark Angels by Karleen Koen,"I loved her first book, Through A Glass Darkly, I read it at least four more times!! Her sequel, Now Face to Face, was closure to the first, but not as exciting or sad. I cried every time I read the first one! Dark Angels deals with the young Alice, the grand old grandmother in Through A Glass Darkly. She's just as feisy and clever in this prequel, but I still liked Through A Glass Darkly the best out of the three. If you want to read any of the books by this author, I suggest you start with that one!"
5,Grandmama,"We have all loved Barbara for the past 20 years, and her exploration of the new country and domination of the old country for 10. This was not a novel, but an extended and intimate character study into Alice Verney. It explains so much! No, it doesn't tell the story of her and Richard's formal courtship and marriage, the birth and death of their children. It illustrates, not explains, who Grandmama is, how she came to love Richard synonomus with breathing, and almost as stealthily, and how she, strong, willful Alice, could have permitted Diana to be what she was. And why she could not refuse Barbara even Roger, when she knew he was wrong for her. It was a specatular book. We can only hope for more."
5,Dark Angels,"This book awesome, I was unable to put it down...went through many sleepless days, hahaha.."
2,Very disappointing,"I had to force myself to finish this book in order to feel qualified to review it. Koen's other book, ""Through a Glass Darkly"" is one of my favorite historical novels, and I probably read it once a year. This one, however, is just not enjoyable. After I had read 1/3 of it, I still felt no connection to Alice, the main character. The writing was very disjointed, and it was very hard to tell who was talking or being talked about a lot of the time. I loved the character of Alice as the grandmother in ""Through a Glass Darkly"", and I was really looking forward to reading about her younger life. The Alice in ""Dark Angels"" did not mesh with the character as I knew her in the other book, and I wish I had never read this one. Very very disappointing."
2,Help.....who is who???,Too many characters introduced in the first few pages; all with similar names. I could never keep track of who was who. Constantly trying to remind myself of who each character was and how he was related to the story had me skimming previously read pages and left me confused and distracted from the story. I got through the first 100 pages and then gave up. I read a lot and this hasn't happened to me before; maybe it was simply me and I just wasn't concentrating. Anyone else feel this way?
3,Decent but not as good as previous books.,"I really liked ""Through a Glass Darkly"" and the sequel. This book was okay and will spur me on to rereading the other two books. It just didn't grab me as much as I expected. I found the loose ends disappointing as well. I like Koen's writing but was a little disappointed in this one."
5,Love this and the rest of the trilogy,"Dark Angels is the first of a trilogy of the Tamworth family, in the court of Charles II, to Through A Glass Darkly, with all the intrigue of the South Sea stock bubble and burst, to the tug of war of the Hanoverian court and Jacobite intrigue in Now Face to Face.I love good historical fiction, and this fits the bill. Romance, intertwined with a large helping of duty, Spinkled liberally with murderous plots, wrapped around social convention and the ever-present danger of being in close proximity to monarchy.I have re-read this book several times, and then end up continuing to the end of the trilogy because I so love the characters and I hate when it ends and they are...gone. Until time passes and I pick it up again."
4,enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book as much as all of the Koen books I have read. What I did not like was the way Koen portrayed her main character. Alice is made out to be a manipulative, lying, bossy, mean, and too ambitious. She seems to have no care to make sure she enjoys her life, only to marry well to have money and authority. Sometimes she seems caring. Also the book drags in some places. Most will like this book unless you like your main characters to be likable because Alice is not very likeable at all"
1,"I tried, 3 times........","......but cannot get into this book. It's a shame because I loved the 2 previous novels by this author. It seems to me she tries to set up too many stories with too many characters too quickly. I keep getting lost, and try as I might, I can't go any further to make sense of what is going on. I have read the first 20 pages or so 3 times, actually got to page 60 at one point, but decided I can't take it any more. I'm moving on and this book goes in the give-away bag."
2,Seems reasonable for the price.,I haven't used it yet. Nice size. Going to Europe for couple of weeks and hopefully it holds up to baggage handling.
4,"Sometimes dated, but always a fun read","Though this book was written close to 40 years ago, and though Rossiter knew nothing about the Kennedy assasination, Watergate, or Vietnam, this book makes bold predictions about the future of our country and our presidency with surprising accuracy. The book is written sometimes in a conversation-like tone that makes for easy reading, and the author (while incredibly knowledgable) makes no effort to talk over the readers head. It is a bit old though, and the type of analysis Rossiter uses (namely a constitutionalists point of view) is out-dated. However, it is an optimistic and inspiring book that every future president should read."
3,Just Not My Style!,"This is a just a 30 page book that does give good instructions on how to paint candles, which is just about 2 pages. The rest of the book is individual projects with specific information for each project, and patterns. The problem I had is I should have paid closer attention to the pictures on the cover, because I just didn't care for designs. The information on how to paint the candles was good, I just didn't care for the mostly Modern Victorian style. I thought there might be some other kind of designs, but there weren't. What you see is what you get. This on is my fault."
3,Statistical information can sometimes be misleading.,This book was educational and interesting. I never realized that so much can be hidden behind statistics. Sowell searches for truth by bringing to light all the data behind the numbers.
3,"ORIGINAL O SCHMIDT LIGHTER, STRINGS TOO STRETCHY","MADE IN CHINA. LOOKS FINE BUT MUCH HEAVIER THAN OSCAR SCHMIDT ORIGINAL. STRINGS HAVE TO BE RETUNED OFTEN AS THEY STRECTCH OUT. THIS IS ANNOYING , BUT MAYBE ONE CAN PURCHASE ORIGINAL SCHMIDT STRINGS."
1,"Clancy: stick with fiction, or improve your research.","I'm not a historian, but I counted a dozen errors in fact and interpretation in the first four pages. Example? Robert Fulton did not demonstrate his Nautilus to the British in 1804, or ever. He built one Nautilus, and one only, which he scrapped in France. Nor did he ""destroy a number of vessels in test runs,"" anywhere. My source is the ""Navy Times book of Submarines,"" written by retired Navy Captain Brayton Harris. It's billed as a ""Political, Social and Military History"" and may be the most accurate overall history of the early years of submarine development . . . ever. The rest of Clancy's book? I found it a bit tedious."
4,interesting,"interesting tour inside a nuclear submarine, with great histories,the perisher course is a big history. you can't loss the book"
3,This isn't good enough. It's sloppy craft.,"It is simply not good enough. It's easy to read, sentence for sentence, but it's actually the worst submarine book I've bought, and amoung the worser I've read. Sudden statements are made, without any substantiation or reference. (Ibid. is worser than none, as it just reduce readabilty.) Some of the statements I simply can't find reason to believe. - I love Tom Clancy as a novell writer, and I think he is good to write. This could have been good, if he either had asserted a proper research for each and every postulate in the book, or got a proper proof reading. Let me instead advice the following three books: ""Blind Man's Bluff"", ""Submarines (Brassey's Sea Power, Volume 7)"" and ""War Beneath The Sea"""
3,Submarine,"Sorry to say that I did not read past the first couple of chapters, as those at least, seemed to be almost exact copies of Peter Sagons ""Stalking the Red Bear"" which I considered to be outstanding. I will probably try a ""DO Over"" the next time I'm Snowed In."
4,Not for serious readers and collectors!,"I haven't got too much submarine knowledge, but in this book Clancy gives you a general history of submarines and how to become a submariner. The book is to complicated for beginners, if you don't know basics. But you will learn more about subs after you read that book, but there is a mistake in the book; he wrote 60+ nm as ADCAP's speed but it is 55+ actually. Where did I get information? From Jane's Information group(Which is the biigest and oldest information group for military equipment in the world.) There is an idea in the book which is repeating very often ""America has the best stuff."" In the book he made a pretty big tour in the USS Miami and talked with her crew, he also talked about the HMS Triumph and her crew which is the A Royal Navy sub. There is a very useful Glossary annd a sub identification hand book at the end of the book. If you are just interested in with the subs you should read that book."
5,"Practical, realistic, easy.","I first read this book years ago as a child. Perhaps the few reviewers on here who do not like the book (and use this review as an outlet for their own personal politics) on here do not realize that parents, teachers, community leaders and religious leaders hardly shelter kids from the outside world as it is, and this book will not upset children, ruin their happiness or waste their childhood at all. As a kid, my friends and I readily accepted this book and were happy to carry out many of the suggestions. Adults seem to look down on kids a lot and think that they just want to play all day and have little care for anything but themselves. The things kids love, such as animals and the outdoors, are in danger, and this book lets kids contribute to help saving them. There are plenty of little tips in this book that do not advocate huge, drastic lifestyle changes. This book also does not come across as preachy or arrogant. Overall it is practical and enjoyable to read."
3,"A little preachy but overall, very informative","We recycle and are sensible about our power and resource use in our home. While this book offers lots of information and easy ways to reduce our effect on our environment, it is a little preachy. Overall, I found this very useful as part of our story hour theme for Earth Day."
5,Works perfectly,"I recommend this to anyone who wants more in front without going too crazy on price or hardware (software?). Very nice feel, very good product.XOXO"
3,Save money,"I had this product 10 years ago and wanted it again, after trying a cheap pair of push ups, but after they charged me ( before shipping the item ) they emailed me and notified me it was no longer available and they could send me a product replacement instead, I told them no and I ordered a set at half the price from Fredericks of Hollywood and they are just like the original curves I was looking for. Order fredericks . and I ordered their water bra in every color....my favorite favorites!!"
3,Hyper Great Dane,"This is a great product and it has made walking my Dane SO much easier .... BUT .... the reason I gave it 3 stars rather than 5 is that it's a HUGE pain in the butt to get on and off. Had I known this I would probably not have bought it. If he sat nice for me it wouldn't be so difficult but then again, if he sat nice I wouldn't need it. LOL"
4,Like a miracle,"I have bought these before, and they made the difference between getting dragged, and going for a nice walk. I bought one for my foster dog, because he was yanking our shoulders out of the socket when using a regular collar and leash. Now he jogs along side me, and he is a pleasure to take out. Regular choke collars can damage a dog's neck, but this works by pulling them sideways when trying to pull forward, and they have to stop pulling in order to walk forward towards where they want to go. My only complaint is that the adjustments tend to loosen, needing regular adjustment to work effectively."
5,Tweener Harness,Finally! I was able to find a harness that fit my dog properly. He is a 60 pound doberman mix and the medium was squeezing his chest and the large fell off him. This tweener size fits him perfectly!
2,harness,"by the time I figured out how to put the harness on my dog, we were both frustated. I bought another kind that is adjustable and once he was fitted, all he has to do is step into it (which took only one time ) then it just clips on, much better and it keeps him from pulling on the leash."
1,Not for dogs low to the ground.,"I had to return 2 of these harnesses (and got dinged a 20% restocking fee from this seller - on top of the cost of shipping both ways). This harness does not work with all dogs. Both my dogs fit the ""girth measurement"" but the loop where the leash attaches drags on the ground. My two dogs were able to walk out of the thing and kept getting their front legs tangled up. Also there is one dimension where the harness can't be adjusted so you might find, as I did, that the girth measurement is correct, but it still is too big for your dog. The description should have warned the owners of ""short"" dogs that this would not be a good choice.If you want to try this out on your dog, buy it from a dealer who will refund ALL the purchase price without a 20% restocking fee. It's too risky otherwise."
2,Difficult Read,"I can read Shakespeare, but this, I cannot read!! Super difficult. Go with the modern version. This is impossible. No..."
5,Great Book!!,"Most comprehensive book I have found that covers all the different points about teaching sewing. Covers costs, traveling, children and where to get lesson plans. A great start to finding out about a new teaching career."
4,Informative Book,"Most of the information I had already known, but a good book for starting a small business. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to teach sewing."
4,Excellent study of medical passion,"I have read Not as a Stranger perhaps four times, and every time come away with something new. The older I become, the more I realize the story is not so much about Medicine, and the passion/obsession required to complete medical training, but about a man who matures and realizes that he is not an island. Compassionate telling of a situations that are still relevant today. The examination of small town life, politics, and the medical industry in the early twentieth century is very well done. What is amazing is the examination of one man's marriage, but I leave that to the reader."
1,Baddest quality,"This tape broke in the first month of very light amateur use. It has never been dropped or abused, but the retraction spring mechanism just stopped functioning, I had to retract the blade manually by puhing it inside the unit. At this price this is as bad as it gets. Two thumbs down."
4,A MUST READ FOR LOVERS OF GREAT ROMANCE,"An absolute gem of a book. I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this book in the library. Lovers of historical and contemporary romance alike will LOVE this book. Hero and heroine are artfully and skillfully drawn with believable motivations. The determination and guts of the heroine will have you cheering her on from the bleachers. The depth of the secondary character (hero's sister) makes for a fine supporting cast. The depth and development of the romance (after all this is why we're here) is engaging, poignant and powerful. Great PLOT, great ROMANCE and great CHARACTERS - in short a MUST READ. Well done Ellen Fisher!"
5,A wonderful new author!,"I loved Ellen Fisher's fantastic debut novel, THE LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS! The characters were admirable and full of depth, making you feel for them from the very first page. I've always been a big fan of the Pygmalion plot, and Ms. Fisher has done it here with a style all her own. This is a wonderfully detailed, emotional book, by a fresh new talent in historical romance! I've just added another 'automatic buy' to my short list of terrific authors---thanks for a great read, Ms. Fisher! Looking forward to the next!"
1,simplistic drivel,"I found this book simplistic and trivial. The concept of ""respectful pluralism"" doesn't hold up under rigorous analysis. Sometimes the middle ground is a fine place to be, but only if you can present a coherent argument about why. Unfortunately, Hicks does not do that. The book is also terribly written--simple where it should be complicted, complicated and obtuse where it needed to be. Really there must be better books on the subject out there . . ."
5,Amazing Sub!!!,i was a bit wary of ordering this sub but i must say it has really been great! i highly recommend these subs to anyone! i am running about 600 watts RMS right now in a ported box and this thing handles notes well on all levels without distortion! def recommend this and will stick with these in the future!!!
4,Awesome sub at a great price,I bought this sub 2 years ago and it is great. I like how loud it can get while still maintaining good sound quality. This is a great sub for someone looking to get into car audio. It can be found online for half the cost of what retail stores like best buy and circuit city sell it for.
1,alpine sub broke after two weeks didnt abuse at alll i want my money back,I had the product a alpine type r 12 in for two weeks had a alpine mrp 500 amp with gain way down and the sub stoped working and makes a pop crackle noise when i turn on the amp. I really need a new sub please help
5,Sounds Great!! Hits loud and low,"I was highly impressed with this subwoofer, as I am new to car audio and was looking for a good replacement for all the stock subwoofers. 1 of these outdoes the four 7 inch door subs my car came stock with. Sounds great, clean and crisp. Near impossible to bottom out, played at full volume.Also has 2 inches of excursion if anyone is curious."
5,Awesome sub,"I have one of these in a Ford Escape, sealed polyfilled .7 cu ft enclosure wired in parallel to an MRP-M500 amp and the sound is amazing. I listen to rock mostly, and the bass is very accurate and hard hitting. Kick drums literally feel like getting kicked and I can feel the rumble of the bass guitar through my whole body. I primarily bought a type R for the SQ, but this beast sets off car alarms with the volume at 3/4. Makes your hair shake and gives massages if you sit in the back seat. I haven't pushed it to its limits, but it has more than enough power if you like to listen to loud music that doesn't sound like a pod of whales farting."
3,OK BUT NOT THE BEST,"These are the subs i used to run, till i got serious. replaced 2 of these with 1 kicker 10cvr124-12. No comparison, the 1 kicker blows these out of the water.so i donatedthese to a neighbor. there not bad but for the same amount of money u can go kicker, and believe me u wont go back to alpine. YES I WAS SURPRISED ALSO. I have been doing systems for over 25 yrs, dont waste your cash on these go KICKER. Get the new VR models they have all the new technology. WILL BLOW U AWAY U WONT BE DISAPOINTED. IF U WANT REAL KICK IN YOUR SYSTEM YOULL HEAR WHY THEIR CALLED KICKER."
5,obscure film inspires new television series,"This limited release short film, created by a maverick film maker and a real cop, has been an inspiration for the new network television series H-CARS starring John Schneider. The original COPZONE was shot on a shoe string based on an original script that played well in a major film festival.Hang on to your original release copies, they are hard to find."
1,heart shaped cupcake pan,"product pictured in William Sonoma Catalogue. it was not available. boughtit from amazon. product does not make cupcakes as pictured. sides arehard while cake is very dense. would like to resell it. used cupcake mix fromsprinkles bakery in Beverly hills, CA. was supposed to make 12 cupcakes. onlymade 6. very poor advertising and product representation"
5,explains a lot!,I really enjoyed this book. Several personal stories about Alan Freed provide insight into his life. The writer does a good job of explaining the historical events/context that surrounded Freed's life. It's a shame Freed didn't live longer to see what he contributed to popular music.
5,Great Book,This is a great read about the history of the Hudson River and it's people. A must read for everyone from the area.
5,"It disgusts, but it fascinates","Mark Manning's confessional tome really dredges the depths of human behaviour. Trapped in the ultra-sleazoid world of eighties rock, the former Zodiac Mindwarp embarks on a rampage of misogyny, self-destruction, alcohol, drugs, hardcore pronography and more. What saves the book is that it's not boastful at all - Manning's self-disgust and self-loathing overides all the evil things he has done and he even emerges as being charming. Quite bizarre all in all, a book that should turn your stomach but ends up being too compelling to put down. It's illustrated by the author too, which is a treat."
3,a nice change,"It was nice to read something that doesn't have me trying to skip over curse words two and three times a page! I consider the entire Georgia Trilogy worth reading. The Christian background is inspiring; plus, the novels were based on the life of a very real woman (supported by indicating places of burial and names of decendants in the Afterword of each book). The Christian theme and romanticized diction may seem boring to some, but read with an open mind and I'm sure everyone will find a point to enjoy."
3,"Rate this book a 3 -- but, Price's St Simons and Fla triologies are all 5's","This particular book is a little slow, but still romantic and based on a real personality which makes it worth a read -- when we read about a person depressed/self-absorbed today (the way they are dealing with losing nearly everyone in life in a short time span...and reality check -- some people do go through great periods of personal loss in their life) I don't think we'd be quite so judgemental as many folks in these reviews. It's important when reading historical fiction to keep a perspective for timeframe the book is taking place, life is not a bed roses and not everyone in a book/history is happy all the time. I find it refreshing to read truthful books, historically based and well researched -- while this one isn't Eugenia Price's best work, do yourself a favor and try the St Simon's Triology or the Fla triology -- all six well-written, historically based, well researched and well written."
1,not this time,"If you've read more than a few Price books, it becomes visibly apparent here that she's losing her touch. Her characters become messy, half-done, overly sentimental, and downright cheesy. Please, give her a chance and get out of these newer ones. Check out the old ones. The St Simons Trilogy: Lighthouse, New Moon Rising, and The Beloved Invader; The Florida Trilogy: Maria, Don Juan McQueen, and Margaret's Story; and the first three of the Savannah Quartet: Savannah, To See Your Face Again, and Before the Darkness Falls (I can't personally recommend Stranger in Savannah, I didn't care for it). I had the pleasure of interviewing Miss Price back in the 80's, and she was a delightful lady with great talent, but with her latter books she took a spill. Don't waste your time. READ THE OLD ONES!!!!"
1,wrong book,"I wouldn't know as I recieved a book titled Beauty for Ashes written by Joyce Meyer. At the time I did not know how to return it, so it sits unwanted."
1,"Breaks easily, tastes like saccharin","The new version of Glide floss is not what it used to be. The taste is unctuously sweet and it now breaks more easily. Why does Crest insist on messing with success? Its toothpastes, like this new version of floss, are sickeningly sweet. Is Glide still made using the original Goretex material? It doesn't seem so -- now it's just expensive floss tape ruined by marketing overkill."
2,"Comfortable, but...","Crest bills their Deep Clean Cool Mint Floss as being more comfortable than other floss and providing a ""cooling blast of clean feeling."" On these counts, I can agree. Glide Deep Clean is wonderfully smooth and comfortable, making flossing downright pleasant on both your gums and your fingers. The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you've cleaned.But... It's the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest's claims of being ""shred resistant"" fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven't yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can't even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn't inspire confidence. At the price premium Crest is demanding, I'd expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece."
5,Does Not Break Off,"I've had a lot of difficulty in the past with cheap floss that breaks off & frays. You do not get that with this! Also, it works great for people who have sensitive gums that tend to bleed after flossing. I highly recommend!"
3,Carol sings Eartha,Ok! We all know Santa Baby will always be synonomous with Ms Kitt but in this recording taken from a live radio broacast you get the rare opportunity to hear it covered by Broadway's Carol Woods.
4,Well done at a glance but ultimately lacking,"Nice and impressive at first but ultimatelyit doesn't tell you how to do suchgreat things yourself nor does it provewhy some things are better.One case in point is in the intro he seems tosay that pie charts are bad and 3d shadowedpie charts are worse, but then he featuresan article (on calories) that has, suprise,3d pie charts.It's a keeper and I want to pass it around butit's not perfect.In contrast I believe on of the ""Toz on UI""books (By Bruce Tog.... of Apple) at leastrefers to studies done to ""prove"" thatcertain ways of designing the screens areempiracally better."
5,Information Anxiety is a MUST read,"If you or someone you know CARES about the issue of communication, this book is a must read. If I was a millionaire, I might like to send copies of this book to all the documentation people in our computer software and consumer electronics industry. Wurman dares to stand up and point out the differences between ""data"" and ""information"". The way the text of this book is formatted even speaks volumes. He shows us how to do more with less and jump over hurdles that bar us from understanding"
1,Should have followed his own advice,"I admit it, I like the idea of Information Architecture. I think we all owe Wurman a debt for popularizing the idea. But gosh, how come he didn't follow his own advice in organizing this mess of a book? Was there an editor involved? I think the review entitled ""Swill"" was being polite."
1,Swill,"Mr. Wurman's Access series are good. They assist in travel and are very well designed. Sadly, though, this does not make Mr. Wurman versed in INSTRUCTION. Through _Information Anxiety_, I learned nothing. It's a waste of (ironically) this valuable time Wurman correctly emphasizes so much. Mr. Wurman should stick to his knitting: travel. Avoid this one"
5,METAL PERSONIFIED,"Bottom line... If you like metal get this album. I have been a Judas Priest fan for over a decade now and to me there is no better vocalist than Mr.Halford. Your Tates and Dickinsons definitely deserve rightful mention, but Ralf Scheepers more than holds his own and this compact disc is absolutely ... awesome! To the metal uneducated, this guy was in the running for the vacant vocalist slot left by the aforementioned Mr. Halford and did not get the job (although I think he should of). Ripper Owens is awesome and it is a hard job choosing between who would have been the better replacement, but for some reason I'm leaning more towards Scheepers for scheer range, however I am dying to see what Priest comes up with with Tim. Anyway, I'm not going to bore you with a track by track analysis of this album, but when you put it in and push play, strap yourself in and get ready for a rollercoaster ride...Enjoy!"
3,OK copy of Painkiller,"I have this image in my head of a metal band who stumbles apon the Judas Priests studio notes from making Painkiller. Unfortunately, they don't speak English, so they take some classes and learn English and then record a new album, which is Nuclear Fire. Don't get me wrong, this is a fun album to listen to and has its moments, but it doesn't exactly rate with Priests work. They have some really goofball lyrics that try to follow the Painkiller model: unrelated phrases strung together to create an image (vs a storyline approach). In Painkiller, it worked well, here it doesn't because I think they need a few more English lessons.Of course, if you don't read the lyrics, what the heck? The drums are furious, the guitars and vocalist are screaming, and the recording sparkles. Somebody get these guys a good producer so they can make some original songs and then we'll have a contender!"
3,Descent album,"3 and 1/2 stars. . . This is a descent album by Primal Fear, not my favorite, but still a good listen. The arrangements are not as solid as other albums, but it still delivers with great vocals and guitar. They are a great metal band, and actually never released a bad album. I would have given the album four stars if it weren't for the lack of solidarity and melody.Buy it"
4,Primal Fear Shreds!,"Well, all of these other reviews make an automatic parallel to Judas Priest. I think we ought to treat this band as their own entity. Primal Fear truly pulls melodic riffs and quality and melodic/harmonic vocals together well. This as well as their previous album keep you listening rather than skipping to the next song. If you like straight ahead metal and good vocals, do purchase this CD, as you will definitely not be disappointed. Heck, any Primal Fear CD for that matter is worth buying. Over half of the songs have heavy thumping riff lines. Not wuite like a ""Postmortem"" Slayer, or ""Leper Messiah"" Metallica intro's, which is what I rate all chest hammering riffs against. But, there a few that really are close. Anyway, buy this ... it is very good. Close to five stars.....I few I have rated with 5 are Master Of Puppets, Reign in Blood, Horrorscope(Overkill), Powerslave (Maiden). So, there's a taste for where my opinions come from.Buy it!!--------Shawman...Northern California"
