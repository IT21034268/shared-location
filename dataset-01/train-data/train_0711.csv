3,fun and easy!,"i first saw this book in a Michael's but didn't buy it. Years later I bought it off the Amazon marketplace and am happy to have it as part of my knitting library.The projects are easy! The photos are great (I'm a fan of using real people as models), the additional tips and techniques I've used in other projects and while there are a few mistakes here and there, there are other books out there with far more - blame the editor, not the designers!"
2,one star for effort,"The few that I liked use either very thick or very thin yarns. The capelets (shortie capes) definitely don't interest me. The photos are nice. Maybe something will inspire me, but I doubt if I'll be making anything from this book. So far it's the worst poncho book I've bought."
3,Complicated attachments,"Overall, this is a mixed review since the suction is excellent. Does nothing on carpet, bare floors only. It's great as a hand vac, but the extending handle is too short for floors. The place where the cord attaches to the body lost its rubber guard almost immediately on mine so the bare cord is showing and it's probably not too safe but I still use it. It's incredibly complicated to switch attachments so I don't bother with them. Emptying the collection bin is always a chore and the filters are VERY costly. I only use it when cleaning the car (with a long extension cord) or when house chores demand a strong hand vac. The unit's chassis gets very hot as you do a job so be careful. It is lightweight so it flops around and you have to watch out that it doesn't flop over to block its exhaust vent. Even tho it has terrific suction, the little user-unfriendly issues really add up. I would not purchase it again."
2,Not good with dog hair,I bought this product about a year ago! I am not happy with it!! It doesn't pick up dog hair it clumps it up and you have to pick it up off the floor. I feel like I am the vaccum cleaner. I am actually looking for a new vaccum!!!! It picks up little stuff but thats it. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have dogs or small kids!!
5,Perfect for what it is.,"Not really for carpet. But wonderful on hard flooring to suck up loose dirt, dust and pet hair. Perfect for pre-mop. Great for furniture and cleaning out the car ect."
2,fine for small jobs,"This vacuum has pretty weak suction. On our carpet, it bundles the hair and we must pick it up ourselves. Also it gets full very very fast: We always have to empty it after each vacuuming basically. The filter got very dirty fast. It is light and easy to maneuver though."
2,looks good.....,"very cute, and compact. Doesn't work very well, it clumps all the hair on my carpet in a spot and i have to pick it up myself. If your looking for something small for a studio apartment it is alright. If you need a vacuum to do the job quickly i don't recommend this."
2,WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!,"WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!! I PURCHASED THIS VACUUM 5 MONTHS AGO AND LET ME TELL YOU! I HAD TO CHANGE IT TWICE AT THE STORE AS THE TWO PRIORS WERE RETURNED AND IN NOT WORKING CONDITION OR MISSING PARTS. O.K. ALTHOUGH IT HAS GOOD SUCTION, IT IS HARD TO ROLL OVER CARPET. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MONTHS, THE METAL PUSH BUTTON FELL OFF THEN THE HANDLE BROKE OUT OF ITS SOCKET. BECAUSE IT COMES WITH A STRAP I PLACED THIS GARBAGE ON MY SHOULDER TO SALVAGE SOME USE AS I HAVE TWIN TODDLERS, AND IT JUST KLONKED OUT COMPLETELY!!!!!!!! NO HELP FROM SERVICE CENTER EVEN AFTER THE FIRST COMPLAINT! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! YOU WILL MOST DEFINITELY REGRET IT. IF YOU JUST PURCHASED ONE, THEN TAKE IT BACK! IF YOU CAN'T RETURN IT, GOOD LUCK - WARNING TRASH IS ON THE MARKET."
3,Great independant film,"This film is early 80's sci-fi. It appears to be an independent film of low budget. Their is one scene early on where a cow has been killed by something unseen and when wild dogs are eating it one of them gets sucked into the cow. This is the only exciting scene, everything else is very plain. The story continues on to explain of alien DNA found on the moon was being tested in space on lab animals. The satellite falls to earth crashing in Spain. Over a years time they experiment on the alien DNA until it gets loose and starts killing of the residents of a small town deep in Spain. The movie spends most of the time on useless chatter and rarely gets into exciting dialogue. At the conclusion only a few escape the town moments before an air strike believing they are free from the alien virus and incineration, only to find out they were wrong. The alien kills a store clerk. The film ends there and its up to you to imagine the outcome."
1,No Triffids,"This collection does not include the movie ""Day of the Triffids"" despite what the title says. I sent it back."
2,Not as advertised,"Bought this title to see Triffids, but Triffids was NOT included. What a disappointment."
2,"This is a horror classic, with little to none popularity","Alien Predator and I go way back. I remember watching it on cable premium channels when i was younger. If you are looking for something with great plot, watch titanic. However if you like cheesy, simple plot, low budget horro films... this one is a good time."
3,Hinduism,I was interested in learning a bit about the religion of Hinduism. This book did not provide the information I was looking for but it was a good read for someone looking for more information about other religions.
4,New series?,"I enjoyed this ""cozy"" mystery, and I hope it is the start of a new series. Although the novel doesn't quite have the depth of Anne Perry, I think this book will appeal the the same readers."
3,test in the book,hi - i actually wanted to give this test ..but not sure of...there are some tests already in the book...does this test provide much more?
3,"A good book, if career planning was a useful thing","The Pathfinder is one of the better career books out there, and I used to recommend it until I figured out that 99% of all career planning is bull****. People and industries change too fast nowadays to plan anything useful beyond a couple of years, and that's a good thing. Career planning, if done right, is taking an extra step of doing something you were already going to do. If done wrong, career planning is nothing more than stalling.Want to find a job you'll love? Here's my 3-step plan: (1) Throw away that career book. (2) Try as many new activities as you can, and over time this will inevitably lead to meeting new people and learning about even more opportunities. The key is to do more doing, and less thinking about doing. (3) Rinse and repeat. Do more of the things you love and less of the things you don't."
3,A High Schooler's Review,"I am a junior in high school. I used The Pathfinder to work out which career path would be right for me. This book was helpful in sorting out my different goals and wants related to my future work life. Chapter 24 was especially helpful in job research. I would interview professionals and dig up copious information through other sources (books, internet, i.e.). Although this book was helpful, there seemed to be a lot of ""busy work"" involved. Some of the lists and writing activities didn't make sense in the context of figuring out my profession. All in all, this was a decent book that will get you started on a path to finding your future career. I recommend spending some extra time on the ""wants"" and ""commitments and requirements lists"". This will help you greatly as you go through the rest of the book. - By C. Thompson, Age 16"
3,I did not finish this book.,"Just over halfway through, I decided that I'd had it with the stupid little exercises that made me feel like I was in a touchy-feely nightmare.One good thing came of reading this book, though. I realized that my complaints with my job were very common. I also realized that there is a real reason I am what I am, and that every job has it's crappy aspects. It also pressed me to look at alternate careers more closely, making me realize that I was not well suited for them at all.Thanks to this book, I GREW UP, stopped whining and crying, and started to appreciate where I was in life and all that I had accomplished.My job is not perfect but it's mine, and to a large extent it suits me. Thanks for making me see that, Mr. Lore."
4,Helpful & Recommendable,"I bought this book because I was (am) in a mid-life crisis, being forced to look for a new job, and at the same time being a free single not knowing what I should look for. I still don't know what too look for, but in this book I found a description that fitted my critical and pessimistic person so well, that now I know more who I am, and what properties I should focus on when looking for the right job. I'm a somewhat introverted analytical and a bit academic person that already have a good insight into my own person, and I do think this is a very good book. And you only need to read the parts that affect you, as it's easy to get a overview. I also see here on Amazon, that others referrers to this book in positive manners (Finn Norway)."
2,Is there Something I'm not Getting?,"Basically what you are asked to do in this book is generate dozens of lists on your own and that this process will somehow create an epiphany of your ideal career. In the beginning, I forced myself to be open-minded about this process, but found that writing interminable lists, which did nothing to clarify what was already floating in my head, did not lead to a career decision. I suppose that this process is supposed to spark ideas and new insights - it didn't. All the stuff that I wrote down was information I already knew quite intuitively and seemed obvious (e.g., I want a job where I get along with co-workers). What I needed was something structured and concrete that would point me to certain careers, which this book really doesn't do."
3,A series of disjointed and repetitive activities,"This book is basically a collection of various reflective writing activities you can do. There does not seem to be a cohesive or logical sequence to the activities, and some of them seem like rehashed variations of each other. If you're looking for a step-by-step guide to revealing good career choices for you, this isn't it."
3,Hard to get through!,"I have read other such books in as little as a weekend. I found this one very hard to get through. The information was alot, but at the same time took forever to get to the point. After a week I put the book down and never finished it! There are other books out there that are easier to read and get to the point quicker (which is why you bought the book in the first place, right?). I recommend checking out other books related to the topic. If in doubt, you can always buy this one in addition to another one and make your own decision (which is what I did)."
4,Resume Section need to be beefed up,"I bought this book after coming across resume writing advice at the RockWell Institute website and reading reviews here at Amazon. I was given the impression that this book contains more resume writing advice plus formatting examples.This is a fairly thick book and it is very useful for people, especially young people who want to find out what suit them best. However I was disappointed that the resume writing section has little more beyond what was freely available on their website.Still I'll give it 4 stars for the help it can give. I am definitely keeping my copy for future reference. People who plan to read this book should be prepared to put in some hard work (in doing the exercises) to learn more about themselves."
2,Plodding,I found this book to be a real turn off. The presentation was so boring one could hardly get to the message. It certainly did not motivate me in any way to find my path.
3,Good Advice for those in mid-career review,This book seemed like it was written to help mid-career person to find an area of work that matches their passion which they were unable to do for whatever reason.A good book but reading marred by many typographical errors.
3,Terribly insecure...,"The author seems terribly insecure... Much of the first part is trying to convince you that the book will succeed in helping you find your true path... Enough already, let's get on with it!!"
4,Get ready for a new you!,"This is not just another self help book. It is a guided path to your new life. If you are not ready to change your current situation and are just going to skim over it in hopes that you will pick up some new tricks by osmosis, don't spend the money.If you are willing to do a bit of work and know that you reap the benefits of change in many small ways not in one big lump sum, then stop reading the reviews and start ordering.I am very glad that this book was recommended to me and it has opened up a life of happiness with my employment options. I suspect that through the process laid out in this book and the work required to implement change most people that have purchased this book and truly followed the authors words and recommendations have had similar results."
4,Wish it had checklist / templates / web-site / workbook,"Just to add to what others have said about the book. It is quite verbose for me in the beginning -- it just drowned me with words.The ideas are excellent -- the author encourages the reader to go on a self-enquiry path. I wish there was an accompanying workbook otherwise you have to make your own which you may never end up making.Also I wish the book had checklists to chart progress.""What color is your parachute"" made it up for me.Thanks"
4,Pathfinder: How to Choose or Change Your Career for a Lifetime of Satisfaction and Success,"This book helps you figure out what it is that you would enjoy doing. It is hard to read sometimes, because it makes you delve deep inside of yourself at times. You also get to take your time so that you can figure everything out and it helps in other ways besides career. You do not want to buy it until you are absolutely sure you want to delve into areas that are uncomfortable.I give this book four stars."
1,Get on with it,"I read nearly 100 pages before deciding that it is more likely that my next career will come to me in a dream than through this book. At the point I stopped reading the author was still telling me about how The Pathfinder was going to help me define my next career. Most of what I read sounded like a commercial for how great The Pathfinder is. I kept thinking to myself, ""Geez, I've already bought the book! Quit selling me!"" If you're looking for a book that will help you decide what you want to be when you grow up when you're already grown up (like me) this isn't it. Unless it's after the 100 page commercial, and I just didn't have the patience to get to it."
2,A disappointment,"Although this book was packed with information, I found it vague and non-specific. I had a very hard time wading through the barrage of words. The Career Guide for Creative and Unconventional People by Carol Eikleberry helped me much, much more."
4,In Depth Career Advise,I bought Pathfinder because of the self assessments. I am still currently working through the book but I have found the ones I have done helpful already.Buy this book before going to a career counselor it will save you a lot of money in the long run.
5,A Useful Tool,"My bookshelf contains the likes of ""Do What You Are,"" ""Now, Discover Your Strengths,"" and ""Soar With Your Strengths,"" and I was pleased to add ""The Pathfinder"" to my list. I found the book to be rich with exercises and examples that enabled me to drill down further than I had previously. If you are looking for a 'quick-fix' to your career blues, than this is not the book for you (and I doubt that such a book exists). As with any big change, there's work involved. If you are willing to spend the time working through the exercises, then I highly recommend ""The Pathfinder."" And if your budget can manage it, I recommend meeting with a Pathfinder career counselor. I found this to be a terrific compliment to my reading of the book. Good luck!"
3,"Comprehensive, but unfocused","Nice try to summarize existing approaches to life and career planning, plus a heavy dose of new age pop psych. But the whole thing could be much shorter, and much more concise and focused.I found the biggest flaw was that Lore completely misses out on family history and relationships ... that probably serve as the most important context to all the goals, meta-goals and values he talks about. In short: too fuzzy and unsystematic for my tastes, and simply missing core essentials.For more focused and concise approaches, I recommend Bolles: What Color is Your Parachute and Covey: First Things First (and maybe Covey&#65533;s 7 Habits Book) instead."
3,Better for the young,I wish I had read this book when I was 18. It would have been more helpful then when you didn't have to change your entire life in order to make a career change. At 40... find your happiness within and do what you must to make a living. It's a harsh reality.
3,good book. terrible binding,"This is a relatively helpful book. I have read a few that are similar and I would say this is one of the better ones.My major complaint is the physical construction of the paperback version of the book. I have had two copies and both have fallen apart with little use. For a book that is meant to be used as a ""workbook"" that is read, referenced, and reread I would expect it to hold together better than mine have."
2,Too long and windy!,"I bought this book because it had a high 4.5 star rating in Amazon. I have been extremely disappointed. The author of this book must be in love with his own voice. I get the sense that the book was dictated. It wheezes on for over 350 pages. The text is like an endless blog.Years ago, I read What Color is Your Parachute? That was a good book! Buy that one--instead of Pathfinder....unless you like endless pontification."
3,Not For E.N. Fans Only..........,"The best way to describe this solo work by Alexander Hacke is that it is NOT an Einsturzende Neubauten record. The music is not nearly as experimental and all lyrics are ""sung"" in English which kind of sucks. The opening track is very odd in which it is a repetitive rant of a female martial arts instructor shouting out instructions as to how to protect yourself from being sexually assaulted. At first it seems riduculous but then it kind of grows on you not to mention that the suggestions could probably end up saving someone from being attacked. The rest of the record is pretty decent but at times a bit disjointed in that not all the songs flow very well together. Although this cd grew on me over time I still feel a bit disappointed that it's not as experimental as one would have hoped."
3,from a huge neubauten fan.,"this album just strikes me as being a bit average. I love senior hacke. I just could not get into this album. There is one great song ""sister"" if the rest of the album was like that It would have gotten a 5 star review. This album was not as well thought out as it could have been."
2,I guess it would be good if you were into Folk Legend,Not much factual info. Pretty much a dissapointment. No reflection on the seller. VERY GOOD service!
4,"Carpenter goes New Age, but it still works.","Carpenter's score for his remake of Village of the Damned lets the Marin County (where it was filmed) New Age Music sound filter in and it works quite well. Soft and gentle, even when underscoring moments of terror, this score is almost relaxing to listen to. Those fans more interested in Carpenter's hardcore scare music will be happy with the tracks Burning Desire and The Brick Wall. Recommended."
1,"the other reviewer is right, these tights smell awful",I normally really like Hue tights. But these smell terrible. They smell like a cross between a chemical plant and some mildew or mold. I'm not even going to put them on-they're going straight to the trash. Do not buy these if you have functioning olfactory bulbs.
1,Way too dark,"These look like your grandmother's old, dark nylons from 100 years ago. I was looking for a natural, darker than nude color."
4,Always nice...,"Usually get about 4-5 wears before wear-&-tear takes its toll (they even hold up during washings). However, runs occur mostly near seams for me. Overall I like this brand very much. They feel smooth and breathable even as opaque tights. I have them in espresso and black. Great buy for the price."
1,"Not tights, dark pantyhose","The fit and color is okay, but tights should be thick and non-snagging. These are more like pantyhose. They're not thick, not warm and not durable as they snagged the first time I wore them."
5,Love them,These tights have been very durable through many wears and machine washes! Will buy in other colors In the future.
5,Greatest fitting tights,I always go to this brand. Fit and quality are the standout reasons. They also have a great selection of colors. I've tried others and always go back to HUE. The best.
1,Men's Golf instruction with Wally Armstrong and Friends,Hard to write a positive review as the CD was damaged and not useable. If it were me I wouldn't even offer this item for sale. Poor dealer.
5,Easy instructions,"I have baked many, many loaves of bread (many different kinds) from this seller. Every loaf has turned out perfect. The instructions are very clear, you add water, butter and yeast ( yeast supplied). If someone has a problem with these instructions, then perhaps, they should buy their bread from a market.cal"
3,Disappointed,"If you are looking for a book to use as a quick reference for MS Project don't by this one. This book assumes you know nothing and contains too much detail making it difficult to use as a quick reference. I consider a book worth while if I can find the answer to a question, make a few mouse clicks, and get on with the project. This book doesn't do that."
2,Too long-winded and complex for the general user.,"I don't think I've ever found a software manual as frustrating as this one. Though I'm a pretty experienced Project user, I still want to find simple answers to my questions. Here, instead, I get long paragraphs of text. Me, I just want numbered explanations: 1. Click here. 2. Click there. 3. Print. Not in this book. You get long adoring discussions of what Project can do, but rarely get just a step-by-step explanation on how to do it. This book would have benefited with at least one or two tutorial chapters for the intermediate user. (Note that the adoring reviews above are mostly from very experienced users...)."
2,Sometimes Ridiculous Programmer,"John Loder and Ruth Ford star as a soon-to-be divorced British couple who make a crash landing in the Syrian desert along with American pilot Warren Douglas. They wander into a strange village populated by devil worshippers, and although they first become guests of the sheik, they soon become condemned hostages in retaliation for the execution of the sheik's brothers, Nazi spies, by the Allies. This is a quick programmer from Warner Brothers, and it's not very good. Ford shows some potential as an actress, but Loder and especially Douglas give incompetent performances. Paul Cavanagh, as the sheik, displays some skill, while the rest of the cast is negligible. The dialogue is stilted and the story sometimes ridiculous, with the last fifteen minutes being particularly hard to swallow. It's hard to believe Warner Brothers produced this film the same year as Casablanca!"
2,Pass the cheese...,"OK, granted it would have been difficult to find someone in Hollywood who even KNEW where Iraq was in the 1940s, but this is painfully bad. The heroes land near the Jordanian border and they're 300 miles from civilization? I mean, didn't anyone even bother to look at a MAP of Iraq before they made this movie?And why do all the Arabs look like Indians?And where the heck are the British (other than the butler) while all this is going on?By the time it ended I came to the conclusion that the Axis agent was the only likeable character in the film."
2,Way too basic,"I was disappointed in this video. His help on setting up your helicopter?? Read the manual! Great, thanks.Then you are treated to 60+ minutes of him hovering. I just didn't see the value.I bought the RealFlight computer simulation software (there's several on the market) which was much more helpful. Comes with the controller to hook to your computer. It also has training built into it. More money but you get to practice a lot more ....at home. I practice while I have the TV on. Results were almost immediate. Plus you save money on all the rotor blades you didn't break in real flight. One of the RC gurus on the internet suggested putting in 30 to 50 hours on a simulator. Well worth the money to be able to practice the basics of tail in, tail out hovering without having to worry about your rc disappearing into the wild blue yonder or piling into the nearest tree."
1,They Play The Heads,"..but can't jam the changes. Braxton and his ringers have pulled a fast one. (Although I think Ari Brown keeps almost playing, and has to check himself; Mingelberg forgot how, about 15,000 brownies ago).Ornette, like Braxton a Macarthur Genius Grant Winner, started this mess with his version of Klaktoveesedstene with Paul Bley at the Hillcrest Club.Insert some joke about ""returns"""
2,Shattered,"Ah yes, Leelee Sobieski...what can I say? A poor man's Helen Hunt in an even poorer film. Skip it. Better yet, hopscotch it."
2,Not that great,"Normally I like movies that star Leelee Sobieski, but the Glass House was disappointing. It was a very slow moving movie. The previews made the movie look very suspenceful, but when I watched the movie, I found myself waiting for the suspenceful parts that never happened. I would not recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to choose from."
3,"Suspenseful, but....","there was more they could have done with it. This had the makings of a decent horror/suspense flick but it suffered from an underdeveloped plot. The basic storyline was good, but they took too much time explaining some things and not enough on other more important details.Two children are left orphaned and their new ""parents"" aren't what they seem to be. As the movie unfolds, some parts play out pretty predictably, while others come as a complete surprise. It is the latter that make this movie as good as it is. The acting is pretty average, but all in all you could do worse than spending a couple of hours on this. Fairly entertaining."
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"If you are looking for a good thriller... this movie is NOT for you. the movie had a poor story line and is hard to follow. there are numerous occasions where LeeLee does something (eg--> saving the number of the man after mr. glass to the phone) and nothing comes of it.. almost like it's just a time filler because they cant think of anything better to put in there. once i watched the trailer again on the dvd i realized how much the trailer gave away the movie. it was almost as if you could watch the trailer other than watching the movie for 2 hours and still get the entire story line of the movie with the little added bits in there. but as a dvd in general, the special features were ok.. not as good as they could have been.. but oh well."
2,Tedious and improbable,"What begins as an intriguing thriller quickly turns into a major disappointment. The teen heroine is intelligent and quick-witted, but held back by an inept script that never has her do the obvious: call her uncle, call the police, tell more trustworthy adults. Throw in a completely unbelievable and improbable ending - the final 15 minutes utterly laughable - and, voila! You have wasted two hours of your life.Can't recommend this one."
3,"Movie was OK, Main lead was.... well not so OK","The movie was OK- the previews described the movie to be so much more than it is, it seemed like a quickly thrown together movie, that really didn't have much suspense, maybe the movie would have been better if they would have cast a better actress for the lead, I mean Leelee Sobieski is OK I guess for a B movie, but if you want to make a movie to have an impression on people you need a stronger more serious person than her, I mean her acting isnt all that bad- but she is cast in all the wrong parts, I mean I just cannot see her as the strong heroine type, sorry Leelee."
1,There Are No Words to Express...,"How bad this movie is.It's not just cheesy, it's also dumb. Just plain dumb. What happens when you get an intriguing plot, good actors, and cool sets? Oddly enough, you get a poorly acted, scripted, ridiculous film.The plot is pretty good, although not in the least bit scary, as was advertised in the trailers. During the dramatic parts, I couldn't keep from laughing. It was hard to believe some people actually wanted us to be quiet - were they actually enjoying the film? The acting done by the man who plays Terry Glass is comical, not a reflection on him though - just the silly character. They try to keep you guessing, but I knew what was going on the moment I sat down (and I arrived late!)Bottom line: Don't waste your money, like I did. At least see something midly enteraining, like 'The Musketeer', if you insist on seeing a bad movie this fall."
1,Worst Movie I've Seen this year,"I've seen a lot of movies in the theater this year, but this one was by far the worst. I came expecting a thriller, but it was more like I was going to fall asleep. The trailer is totally misleading, it looks all suspenseful. It's stupid, boring and I couldn't wait to get out of it. My butt ached the whole time and I got up to get food or to the bathroom a million times, because I wasn't afraid to miss anything."
4,Classy thriller with brains,"After their parents are killed in a car accident, Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) and her younger brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) are sent to live with their long time friends, the Glasses. While at first the Glasses seem like the ideal replacement parents, Ruby soon discovers that their intentions are somewhat more devious.As Ruby, Sobieski glows with talent and beauty. Morgan, who was in July's ""Jurassic Park III,"" also does a good job. Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane are excellent as the Glasses. They are truly terrifying when the evil starts lurking about. All the talent makes for a delightfully classy thriller."
2,Not so thrilling thriller,"When there parents die in a tragic accident,A teen and her kid brother go to stay with there wealthy family friends,the Glasses in Malibu.But little do the sibling know,the Glasses are hiding a very sinister secret.When I first heard of this movie I thought it would be a decent thriller,with an interesting premise that looked promising enough.But unfortunately I was wrong.It lacked the thrills I was looking for with a very disappointing plot twist that i am not going to give away.Leeleee Sobieski made a very boring and overall uninteresting and pretty bland heroine but at least Stellan Skarsgard made a somewhat decent villain.Overall this film was just a disappointing thriller all around."
1,"Bad script, horrible over all",This movie was the worst of the year. Not scary at all. there are so many holes in this movie......*sigh*. i have no words for this movie.
2,2 Stars for Leelee,"This review is going to be short and sweet:1. Leelee Sobieski is the only reason to see this movie and one day someone is going to give her a chance to prove how great I think she can be.2. Diane Lane is wasted in a ridiculous role of a doctor/drug addict. She should have known better having been in films since she was approx. 10 yrs old.3. Has the director, Daniel Sackheim ever seen an Alfred Hitchcock or for god's sake a Wes Craven movie?4. The ""glass house"" is extraordinarily beautiful.Thanks."
2,Rather crap,"Though it seems to have come out in 02, cell phones don't exist here in a kind of crappy teen slasher pic. The 16 year old at the center is suspicious from the start, but most of the film is a build up to her worst fears coming true. The script is mediocre, so the tension isn't there and the evil guardians don't ring true either."
2,"Too Much Hype, Not Enough Thrills!","I thought this film would be like Hand That Rocks The Cradle. Obviously it was just a reason to give LeeLee a starring role. The best actors are the insane couple. LeeLee is stiff and under acts the entire film. The director gets an A for effort, but this film is nothing different. The Glass House is all right for a movie to catch on late-night cable. But I wouldn't spend any money on it. I bought the movie when it first came out on video and have sense tossed it in the trash. Not exciting enough to keep watching. Save your time and energy for Joy Ride if you're a LeeLee Sobieski fan."
4,Much better than I thought it would be!!!,"I got this movie out with not a huge interest but just to see something on a Saterday night. I was really blow away of how GOOD this movie turned out . It was very suspenceful and scary. The climax was really good. It stars Leelee Sobieski ( Never Been Kissed, Deep Impact ) who I was never really keen on, untill I saw this and now I think shes a good actor.One of my favourite characters in this was the Boy played by Trevor Morgan ( Jurassic Park 3, The Patriot ) because it was cool to relate to someone my age. Over all this movie was very good and I'm defintly going to buy it on DVD."
4,Suspenseful!,"A couple with two children are killed in a tragic car accident. The children go to live with former neighbors, but not happily ever after. Red flags go up and the teenage girl begins to suspect that all is not well in the beautiful home in Malibu where they have been brought by their guardians. The children are forced to share a room, and it appears that their surrogate parents have some serious problems. Slowly the parents' hidden agenda is revealed and the suspense builds. The children begin to feel like prisoners in their gilded cage and they begin to look for ways to escape. The ending is farfetched, but all in all, this movie provides an interesting evening's entertainment."
3,"Not Scary, But Goddarn Suspensful!","I bunch of my friends and I saw this movie last night. They all thought it was going to be sooo scary, and one girl in the group kept saying she was going to barf. Puh-leeze! She was doing it for attention, but that's another story. The simple fact is that this movie is not scary, but it is definitely a good old-fashioned murder mystery that isn't over till it's over. The storyline is a bit discombobulated, but still a respectable movie, it'll keep you thinking and on your toes."
2,Shallow and predictable,"This movie is the 21st centuries version of a ""B"" rated movie. It is entirely predictable and not very thrilling for being a mystery thriller movie. The acting, well, I hope these actors don't quit their real jobs. You guess the ending before it's over. I would certainly NOT waste $ to purchase this movie."
2,Bad with a capital B.,"I expected The Glass House to deliver a suspenseful clever twisting and turning of events amidist creepy adoptive parents. Well...the creepy parents was the only thing we got. LeeLee Sobieski is as stiff as an ironing board, most of the time seeming too embarrassed about taking the role to function properly. The plot seemed great, but the story's twists and turns could have been thought of by a 3rd grade classroom...and they frankly make our heroine look as dumb as a brick. How did this girl not figure out that the lawyer was giving up information to the adoptive family? Hello...earth to Leelee. Some of it was meant to be exploitative...like her swimming in the pool in a ridiculous bikini...or the secretary at the office. No matter, the ending was an anti-climax. But it was all pretty bad."
4,Hang on! You're in for a great ride!,"I bought this film on a whim, not expecting it to be too frightening. Oh, my! It's SO suspenseful, and kept me on the edge until the last second! Great acting, especially by Leelee Sobieski and Diane Lane! I thought the plot was fantastic, the home setting is fabulous -- treat yourself to this film!"
5,A great suspense story.,"The glass house is a great suspense story and it's very entertaining .You never get bored. The actors act very well too, particularly Trevor Morgan.The story: 16 year old Ruby and her 11 year old brother (Rett)'s parents die in a car accident after going out to a restaurant. Their parents long time friends, Mr. and Mrs. Glass, take the children in as their own and become their legal guardians.The Glass's house and the Glass's themselves seem great at first glance, but suddenly strange occurrences begin to happen and Ruby begins to uncover the horrible truth behind the Glasses and the deaths of her parents.The truth lies deep in the glass house.If you're looking for a good chill watch this movie, I highly recommended it."
4,"A great, entertaining thriller - mostly predictable","I thoroughly enjoyed The Glass House. The film has some of the usual cliches in the genre. People popping out of dark corners, people hiding in obvious locations (like under the bed) and not getting caught, people coming back to life after getting mutilated a couple thousand times. But for some reason, I really got into the film and was able to look over those cliches, and I actually didn't think much of them. It is not a classic and is somewhat predictable, but it is sufficiently engrossing and effective to hold interest.All in all, The Glass House is well-worth the money, whether you rent it or buy it."
5,"Chilling, but great!","Leelee is once again great! I won't sum up the plot since others have, but I really enjoyed this film. The sister-brother interaction is actually quite funny, even in this suspense film. Great movie to see!"
4,An solid Suspense-Thriller.,"When Rudy (Leelee Sobieski) and her bother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) discover, their parents died in a brutal accidental car crash. When Rudy and Rhett are adapted by the Glass (Stellan Skarsgard, Diane Lane) are seeming happy couple. But Rudy discover the dark secerts of the Glass, which also invovled her dead parents.This film has srtong lead performances by Sobieski and Skarsgard. This familiar thriller gives an fine direction by Daniel Sackheim and Written by Wesley Strick (Cape Fear, Wolf). DVD`s has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and Pan & Scan also alivable. An good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. An short commentary track with/without from a Deleted Scene. Well done film. Super 35. Grade:A-."
2,Bland and predictable,"THE GLASS HOUSE is about a girl and her brother and they get adopted by their neighbours because their parents died in a car accident. Leelee Sobieski plays Ruby (that girl) and she's your typical high school student. After Ruby and her brother move in with their new guardians (the Glasses) they start to notice some weird things about them. That's all i'm saying about the plot. THE GLASS HOUSE is suprisingly bland. It offers no suspense, a mediocre storyline, predictable plot -- shall I go on? It was boring OK! It could've been a ""made for TV movie"" or one that goes straight to video. It should be collecting dust on the shelves soon."
1,Surprisingly poor,"At a glance, this film would appear to have a nice Hitchcockian plot, filled with suspense and doubt. However, even the intial setup winds up being clunky and nonsensical, while the rest of the film see-saws between laughably ridiculous and painfully dull. Though Leelee Sobieski, Stellan Skaarsgard, and Diane Lane all have given wonderful performances in other films, each of them falls flat in this one, which is to be expected, given how little they had to work with by way of plot and direction. Seek out their other works, and avoid ""The Glass House"" like the plague."
3,It's an ok thriller,"Ruby and Rhett go to live with friends of the family after their parents die in a car crash. Note that I said crash instead of accident. After a strange string of events. Ruby discovers that the car ""accident"" may have been orchestrated. After she catches on her new parents pull the reigns in. The siblings lives may also be in danger. They have to decide between playing along or to break free.This movie is a remake so you can definitely say it has all been done before. Even so this movie is fairly entertaining. It isn't great though. The acting and the story are kinda so so. The saving grace of this movie is the suspense. This movie has some good suspense and the tension gets pretty high. If you add all the movies good and bad qualities together I think it ends up being just average. It's not a must see, but if you're bored and don't have anything else to do watching Glass House is better than sitting around and twiddling your thumbs."
1,Worst of 2001,I agree with the reviewer who said it was the worst movie of the year because it was. The movie was predictable and suffered from poor acting all around...or maybe it was just poor direction. It wasn't suspenseful or thrilling. It was just bad.
1,could not watch!,I have been unable to watch this movie because of some zone issue. I am not happy. I have seen this movie before and found it to be very good wanted my friends to see it also but they weren't so lucky.
4,HP Photo Printer,"I bought the HP Photosmart A516 Compact Photo Printer for my mom. The USB cable and photo paper are sold separately. I connected it to my WIN XP SP2 laptop at home for testing before the holidays and it worked great. When I connected it a Dell also running WIN XP SP2, we had to reset the default printer. The LCD failed to work so I will have to send the unit back. Even without the LCD, we used the unit for testing. The quality of photos, for the unit price, was good. I'm looking forward to replacing it for her."
5,great little printer,This printer is very portable and prints quality pictures on-the-go. I've taken it to work and can take a picture and print it out in a fairly short time using my camera's memory card. Just what I wanted!
2,Return policy,"We wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom. The reason I give two stars is because of Beach Camera's return policy. They grudgingly allowed me to return it, as a one-time courtesy with a restocking fee. I wish Amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company."
2,Alleged ACIM Reader a Big Letdown,"I bought this on the recommendation of teachers of ""A Course in Miracles."" But it turns out to be another smaltsy ""New Age"" book. Dumped it to a friend of that persuasion. I might be a Course bigot, but I dislike mixing it with pie-in-the-sky tripe. Sorry, Hugh, only two points for you."
2,Not as advertised,"More money wasted on a product that claims to reduce the under eye puffiness and dark cirles. Tried the product for over 3 months morning and night, it did not work."
5,Great Stuff,"I absolutely LOVE this stuff. It's so cool and refreshing on the eyes. Not sure if it's supposed to decrease the wrinkles or not, but it sure seems like it helps. Especially in the morning when your eyes are all puffy and dry. Great Great stuff."
4,Great product,I had used this product in the past and forgotten how well it works. Removes puffiness from under eyes and soothing as well.
2,Information very general. Does not include tune-up info.,"Does not include specific information. I.E. Book only displays one type of distributer (not mine) in their example. Chilton's usually has better info than this -- this book, however, isn't one of them. Doesn't give enough information to do a proper tune-up other than point and plug gaps. It is a good resource to have on hand in conjunction with another manual. Do not start a restoration job with this manual alone!!"
4,"The Power of Appreciative Inquiry: A Practical Guide to Positive Change (Revised, Expanded) (BK Business)","This is a very useful book for Organizational Development (OD) Practitioner when using positive approach for their work. As the world is changing and unpredictable, positive change will make the organization more energetic with creation and innovation."
1,beware of the positive reviews,"I bought this book, and it is full of really obvious statements that are not backed by any meaningful examples. A requirements based analysis would have been a lot more useful."
1,Marketing Treatise,"I was disappointed to find what I felt was a marketing treatise consisting of little other than relentless cheerleading. I could not find any details that would help really understand AI (Appreciative Inquiry), let alone allay the qualms of a potential skeptic. After reading about half of the book before giving up, I could not find the how-to's that would, for me, define a path to AI success nor any cautions that would yield clues as to when AI would not be likely to succeed. The book seems to me to be written to sell consulting, not explain the topic. I am now motivated to find a better book rather than to try to use AI."
4,Inspiring and Practical,"As a professional organization development consultant for over 20 years, I have found The Power of Appreciative Inquiry extremely helpful, not only in change consultation but in many other aspects of working with human systems. I recommend it highly."
5,A Must Have In Your Toolbox,"There are few business books that I have found to be both a joy to read, a useful tool, and something that brings spirit and passion into the workplace. This book does it all. It not only provides practical understanding and guidelines for Appreciative Inquiry. It offers the reader a new way of viewing the issues and concerns in their organization - a way that supports positive change and growth. It provides a model for recognizing strengths of any system and finding ways to leverage those strengths in creating the future.I use the book on a regular basis and have given it to clients - ranging from CEO's to change managers- who have found it thoughtful, helpful and exciting."
5,The right balance of principles and methodology,"As an OD professional, I own a dozen different books on AI. This book is the one I most frequently buy for my business leader clients because it offers a great balance between principles and methodology. The clear writing, ongoing case examples and useful tips make ""The Power of Appreciative Inquiry"" a powerful resource for consultants and managers interested in putting AI into immediate practice."
3,basic,Very basic devo. Nothing really new here. Found it to be a rather typical devotion that did not particularly inspire excitement or passion in my teens. There were a few entries that were intriguing and caused some thought.
5,Very Pleased,Received the product and was not able to install it on a Mac though it installed fine on a PC. Sent and email to the developer and had the license key for the download-able version within one day and a replacement CD on the way. Very pleased with the customer support and assistance.
3,The Economist is Transsexual,"I was utterly fascinated by the author's transformation. At the start of the book we meet Donald McCloskey, a noted economist, as well as husband, father, and professor. We also learn that he is a compulsive cross dresser who walks around casually in women's clothing and heavy make up--at home. In his 50s, Donald had a major life epiphany and decided to become a transsexual. He has ""the works""---breast implants, electrolysis, facial feminization, female voice surgery, and sex reassignment surgery. The results are evident in the photographs (before and after) in the center section of the book. ""Deidre"" is a tall, blond, large-boned transsexual. Arms folded, legs crossed, ""Deirdre"" is not exactly my image of the womanly ideal. But judge for yourself.I found the author's literary style a bit unnerving. All those bold ""thoughts"" made me wonder who was speaking---Donald or Deirdre the Transsexual?"
1,I feel sorry for this person's family.,"I started this book with great interest and ended it nauseated. McCloskey, as other reviewers have pointed out, becomes a cliched woman! -- crying at the drop of a hat, carrying around a little dog, etc etc etc. I don't know any real women like this.I was appalled at her treatment of her family. Why on earth would she be surprised when her daughter did not want to ""female bond"" with her? No woman I know would.Overall, the writing displays a marked insensitivity to other's feelings and a great self-unawareness."
5,Nice Tune Up In Vol 2 of Dream Dance,"This CD was surprisingly good. Considering the artists listed are both old & new it still delivers the pulse, pounding beats that it'suppose to do. I'd welcome more in the series."
4,Very Informative,"I have found this book to be very informative and a pretty easy read. Have been able to recommend to others. It is time that we began looking at other solutions to depression besides drugs that have extreme, and sometimes deadly side affects. This book is a good read for anyone, even those who don't have depression issues, to help others and to be informed about how to maintain better, personal mental health."
4,motivating,"As someone who has been depressed for 6+ years, this book is helpful. It's even more helpful as someone who has not been using anti-depressants for 2 years. This book has motivated me to change things in my life to feel better. The book had one simple message for me: without changing your lifestyle, nothing will get better. That should be common sense right? But for people like me who don't think there is anything wrong with their lifestyle until you think about where you're going to be in 10 years...stuck maybe? This book is a step in the right direction, not a cure. This book made a lot of sense to me and I have never been so positive about my depression in my life."
5,A great gift for a college student,"I gave this book to my children at college. They loved it. Easy to read, with really easy recipes. Even my dorky son could use it. My daughters roomates also used it. They need a new copy because they kept it by the stove and now it is stained from heavy use."
4,Great texture for indoor,"A good giant ""tennis ball"" for indoor soccer or other sports (kickball). Mine may have a slow leak as I filled it and it seems a little flat after 2 weeks being kept indoors always. Otherwise a fun ball and kind to the body when it hits you! We pegged several in a kickball game with high schoolers and nobody complained."
1,Dissapointed,"I was so excited when it arrived. BUt, it wouldn't hold air and I'm still getting the run around weeks later from the shipper ATAFA about returning it."
5,Works As A Dog Toy As Well,"So I have a dog who loves to play soccer, but in the house the toy we used before did damage. This thing is like a giant tennis ball, she rolls it around and plays with it just like she would her other favorite toy. So beyond indoor for REAL soccer, it's also an amazing dog toy."
4,Easy to use even for the littlest sandcastle artists!,We got this for a recent vacation- and even the littlest beachbums were able to use these blocks (20 months-3 yrs). It was great that they were able to help in the fancy castles the older kids were building on the beach.
1,Simply DO NOT BUY,"This appliance: is rubbish .. you really waste your time and money: Do not remove the gasket (original) and the needle was already bad swing.Save yourself the money, time and hassle.Simply DO NOT BUY"
1,Coralife deep six hydrometer,Does not work not accurate sucks! Regret buying it! Waste of money seriously do not buy this brand of hydrometer
4,Good for the soul,Lives are wrecked around us and yet there is an answer - to let God be God to do the impossible and for us to do the impossible.
2,Healing is a Choice,A friend recommended this book. I was not impressed with the information (nothing new). It was too slanted from the male perspective.
1,NOT biblical,"The author doesn't seem to have read the Bible. The book says that if God doesn't decide to heal a person, that they may still go on to acquire other types of healing such as emotional or spiritual healing. Arterburn seems confident that God wouldn't hold back on these types of healing, but he doesn't cite Scripture for these views.How can he be SO confident that God may not heal a person physically but God WILL heal someone emotionally?! That makes no sense. And he has no scripture to back it up!Don't buy this book."
2,Whose Choice?,"I wasn't able to finish this book. The theology seemed illogical to me and when something strikes me that way, I don't want to spend any more time on it.Arterburn writes that choosing to be healed is a person's choice. I believe that. But then it says that God may choose not to heal someone. I haven't seen precedent for this in Scripture.The book says that if God doesn't decide to heal a person, that they may still go on to acquire other types of healing such as emotional or spiritual healing. Arterburn seems confident that God wouldn't hold back on these types of healing, but he doesn't cite Scripture for these views.To me, Healing is a Choice reads like the Gospel According to Human Experience."
5,Great old-time music,"This and Vol 2 are two of my favorite disks. Here's the track listing: Carolina in the Morning Daddy, You've been a Mother to Me Bye Bye Blues Heart of my Heart Who's Sorry Now? Down by the Old Mill Stream I'm Sorry I Made you Cry Margie Daddy's Little Girl That Old Gang of Mine If I Had my Way The Ace in the Hole When I Lost You I Want a Girl (Just Like the Girl Who Married Dear Old Dad)Great tunes, very well performed!"
5,Sounds of Spring,This cd touches my soul with joy and peace. It has become our bedtime lullaby...can't fall asleep without it.
4,Good Times,"I saw the show on Broadway and liked it a lot. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't hold out after the Tony's, but I have a feeling this is a show which will do great on tour. I loved the cd as much as I loved the show. The songs are beautiful and I enjoy listening to it over and over.M.R. - Norway"
3,What Can I Say?,"This was an okay musical. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stunning either. For me the music has to be pretty or big and this one was not either of these. It seemed like they were just putting words to music for that purpose and instead of coming up with beautiful moving songs they got plain, okay songs.Some of them were even so similar to other musicals. When Foster sings one song I laughed so hard because it was different lyrics but sounded exactly like Thorouly Modern Millie.On the positive notes some songs were really nicely done. I loved Five Forever and Small Umbrella in the Rain. Unfortunately, some of the songs were bad enough to make me laugh when I should be engrossed in the characters deepest emotions.Overall, it was good, but not amazing."
3,The Music is pretty standard and lacking,I am a hugh Musical Fan And I also Buy aot of cast recording.I find this recording to be lacking in depth .The music does not really bring one in it can be a bit boring but overall pretty good.
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"The presence of Maureen McGovern is not enough to take you out of deep sleep after listening to this dissapointing musical adaptation for the literary classic. The songs are too sweet to my taste, even to the point of being corny. The story line seemed to me quite pedestrian and boring and the characters never seem to take flight anywhere. Out of the musicals coming out lately, I would say this is one of the weakest and most boring ones of the present decade. Save your money and get SIDESHOW, NEXT TO NORMAL or THE MAN FROM OZ instead, three excellent choices from this decade."
1,Good Idea Gone Bad,"I loved the book Little Women, and I love musicals, but this CD did not blend the two well at all! I could barely get through the CD, there may be one or two songs I would listen to again, but not very often. It was difficult to see how these songs could do justice to the mood of the book. I feel that they hurt the story. I don't recommend buying this album."
3,Okay but not great.,"As many of the great broadway production that are out right now, this is rather dissapointing. I ordered this cd without know anything about the musical but since I'm a major broadway lover I thought I would give it a try. All of the songs are rather boring and the music isn't that great. There are a few songs that do stand out and are better but its still rather boring. Sutton Foster's voice is strong and smooth but is not shown off by the score.Also Danny Gurwin and John Hickok provide strong performances but still the songs are not great enough to really bring out there voices. There are not many songs that are great big numbers but many small little numbers. The music also doesn't have alot of depth to it. The ending is terrible in my opinion. Just not that great of a musical."
1,Doesn't Work,"Saw the show in Washington and nearly fell asleep. Should never have been made. The score has grown on me somewhat from repeated listenings on Accuradio, but somehow it still didn't come together. A valiant attempt at musicalizing this great classic.Pleasant CD, but pick up Jane Eyre instead, a musical version of a classic that works beautifully and deserved more success than it acheived."
2,Bland,"The show has a lot of heart, but it's major weakness is it's score.The score is bland and often boring.Not even the immense vocal talents of Ms. Foster and Ms McGovern can make this unispired score worth a second listen."
1,Boring Boring and again.. Boring!!,"Don't get me wrong - I love musical theatre. But this show was just boring. The music is forgettable and extremely weak. I love Sutton Foster, and she tried very hard on the CD, but again, the music is just awful. I would recommend other new Broadway CD's such as: Spamalot, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Brooklyn the Musical and Spelling Bee."
5,Sutton Foster and Maureen McGovern are worth it!,"The voices of the cast are really what make this a wonderful cast recording. Sutton Foster is a joy to listen to from her belting out ""Astonishing"" to the beautiful ""Some Things Are Meant to Be"". Maureen McGovern's ""Days of Plenty"" is incredible. The stand out songs are those three songs. While the others are not going to make musical Theatre history, they are very enjoyable. Especially ""I'd Be Delighted"", which is a throwback to old-fashioned musicals. If you're looking for a pretty score with some beautiful songs, Little Women is perfect!"
5,Great arrangements.,"Except for the modernized logo on the front of the songbook, the musical arrangments of ""Little Women"" the opera, are in keeping with the stage production. I enjoyed is emensly, even though I was not an avid reader of Louisa May Alcott's original novel.So, what I cannot understand, is how they use this new logo as if the opera is contemporary in setting and costumes. It is not. Aside from this personal peeve, the music is great."
5,"Funny, entertaining series of books",If your kids like funny stories about misadventures this is for you. This is a nice series of books that will have the youngsters listening and laughing about the antics that take place. Was fun for the whole family to listen to on trips and can also be used alone for those times that you need a break! Recommend it highly.
4,MUST...KEEP...READING!,"Wally Mcdoogle finds himself in another life or death situation (Well, sort of). Learn important tips like never ride in a hot air baloon and never find yourself running away from a bull. This is also a book that teaches you to have faith in God. This extreemly funny book will (ha ha) have you (ha ha) laughing (ha ha) ALL DAY.WARNING: STUNTS SEEN HERE ARE FOR PROFESIONALS ONLY. SO IF YOU TRY THEM, KEEP CLEAR OF ANY OBJECTS."
1,buyer beware - crying baby !,"my son is 2 years old ,and gets so upset w/ this case(somedays i do too.)it should have specified it was for metal trains only. we have alot of wood cars and they definately dont fit easily(most not at all).this case is not worth the time/money when it comes to wooden trains! i can say,that it will be sold on ebay soon!i would rather use a cardboard box."
2,Designed By An Idiot,"I read the critical reviews before buying this product and I bought it anyway.We received a gift card for my son's third birthday and this was what he really wanted...so this was what I bought.I knew this travel case was designed to hold the take-a-long trains and not the larger wooden trains. And that is what we have.But whoever designed this product is in my humble opinion an idiot.Not only is it difficult for my three year old son to get the trains in and out, it is difficult for me, his forty year old mother, to get them in and out.Thomas just barely fits in the top most opening. All of the trains have to placed inside in a ""just so"" manner.Why they couldn't have made the compartments 1/8 or even 1/16 of an inch larger so you could get the trains in and out is beyond me and I curse the fool who designed this case every time I open it.And I agree with the other people who said that the latch is a horrible choice."
2,Not too pleased!,"I was very disappointed with this product. My son has about 20 trains that I was hoping to have a place to store them. It is too difficult to get the trains in and out of this case. The storage spaces are all different sizes and only certain trains will go in certain spaces. And once you get them in, my 2 1/2 year old cannot get the train out and then he starts crying:("
5,"""I'm a nut"" for this CD.","This CD collection offers both old and new favorites in a fun, upbeat tempo. My little boy loves many of the songs, but he knows mama's favorite is ""I'm a nut!"" Enjoy!!!"
3,"Good for inspiration, but not for beginners' guidance.","This book has some novel and interesting ideas for breaking out of the classical design mold which might be boring to some people. However, contrary to the claim on the backcover that it contains ""...easy-to-follow construction drawings even the most hesiteant amateur will be moved to build..."", the designs really require the skills of a moderately experienced carpenter or cabinetmaker to follow. If you're already experienced in woodworking and reading design plans, then the diagrams may appear to be ""elegantly simple"". However, to a construction novice like myself, the designs will be daunting. The book is worth the price just to get some nice new design ideas, but don't expect it to be a beginner's guide to construction."
5,Very Cool Bird house - unique well designed,"The way I found this book was through a poorly copied version of just one bird house. I didn't know the author or what the book looked like. But, I was very impressed with the single design. I started searching the internet to find this book so I could see all the author's designs. Frankly, these are the best designed bird houses from an architectural perspective. I have built a few. They all receive much praise and complements on their uniqueness and eye appeal. Instructions are advanced so take your time -- its worth the wait. And the birds seem to like the designs too. I am planning on adapting one of the designs for a bat house soon."
2,Building? Hardly,"Building a Better Birdhouse is an art book, not a craft book. It's full of sketches of silly-looking birdhouses, but there are no photographs and no cut lists, no real clues about how to actually build any of them...and no sign of any birds, either. It's just an ego-trip for the author. He brushes off any such criticism by stating that he built all of the houses with found supplies, and you should, too, and therefore measurements are futile. This book is futile, unless you already know how to work in wood like this... which would mean you wouldn't need the book at all.What a waste of money."
3,ok,The product I ordered was returned to the company damaged so they emailed me and sent me another one out and credited my account so the product was free. The only thing was it was a different camera then the one I had ordered. The reason I had ordered the first camera was because it came with a neck strap which I needed because this was to be used as a prop in a dance so I was a little disappointed when I didn't get what I ordered. We had to make our own strap. I did appreciate the company for there service.
4,Great for Weight Loss,"This is low impact exercise, yet very effective. Gives you quite a lot of stretching and exercises all body parts. The first workout has some annoying poems but the second is without any words except transition to indicate change of exercise. This is very useful since you don't have to look at the screen. Tracy Lords looks somewhat disturbing..."
3,Contains BOTH Traci Lords Videos,"This DVD contains both the ""Warm Up With Traci Lords"" and ""Advanced Jazzthetics"" complete Traci Lords exercise videos from the 80's. There isn't much to say about the actual workout, but if you're a Traci fan, this DVD is essential."
2,turns on and off by itself,I purchased two of these clocks for my office staff. At noon each day they come on and at 1:00 they go off. I have checked all of the settings and the alarms are not set. For this to be happening with both units leads me to believe that it is not a fluke.
3,radio/cd player,This small cd player has big sound. Contols for volume and radio are not convenient. Would be better with digital read out for radio. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
4,"Sound won't blow you away, but has large number display",The sound is not that of a Bose system or anything. Does the job and is pretty cheap. Large number display is great.
1,"Not well displayed, not what I needed",The product's details were not detailed enough. Digital tuning was not explained but it became clear that it was internal and the tuning was done by a small wheel. This was not acceptable. I return the item. The vendor was most helpful in this process and the credit has been received.Jim
3,Does what it says on the tin! Alas...,"...the speakers sounded like your typical $9.99 alarm clock, maybe even worse.As in, more muffled, fuzzy, and 'weak' (distorted when turned up even medium-loud.)I was underwhelmed. Which was a shame as everything else was pretty cool.I liked being able to start my day to the gentle song of my choice, and the large display made it easy to check the time from across the room. Even in the daylight. And it was easy to dim them somewhat at night. If not for the speakers I'd be buying this again.(Last one was lost in the move unfortunately.)"
2,Skipping CD's,"I received this radio/cd player in Dec, by Jan it would occasionally skip while playing a CD. By March the CD player couldn't play for more than a few min w/o skipping. I exchanged this unit for another exactly like it and it is already occasionally skipping. Therefore, I will be returning this unit too. I think the radio and the clock work fine. I use the CD player for about an hour every day and it's more than this unit can handle."
3,"great, except for one thing","I'm looking for something to use at work. This clock radio w/CD would be perfect, except for one very important thing: it lacks a jack for headphones. Headphones are an absolute must in the office! The alternative is one of the giant, desk hogging boombox things, that boast powerful speakers -- which are exactly what you don't want at work."
3,Bad dream machine,"Didnt last long, product was barely used and died quickly. With all the multifunction your think parts of it would work but sadly it didnt last long."
2,Sony cd clock radio not enough volume,The clock radio works great but the sound is very low even when placed on high volume.Not loud enough to wake me.....purchased at amazon.com
4,Good dual alarm,"Nice big display (my vision is really bad!) and easy to find alarm cancel button. Easy to select alarm function (radio, beep, CD, or off) that is independent for each of the two alarm settings. Especially nice is the beep that comes on about every 2 seconds and progressively speeds up the interval to wake you from a deeper sleep.On the negative, there is no battery back-up (it is pretty easy to reset the times). The sound is poor, but I didn't get it for that. Radio tuner is very hard to get to and adjust, so if you change stations periodically this would be a pain.I can't make a judgement on the dependability this soon after getting it."
2,CD player stopped working after 9 months,"My only complaint with this is that the CD player worked sporatically since I got it. At 9 months it stopped completely and won't spin. Since this is the ONLY reason I bought it, it was a waste of money. Now it is too late to return without paying shipping etc."
3,beware,I wanted to listen to my meditation cd's at night- but guess what... does not have a head phone plug! I'm returning. I can't believe it does not have a port for that.
3,speakers aren't my favorite,"While most people need a radio/cd alarm clock to help them wake up, I need one to help me get to sleep. I like the different light settings on the clock, the ""low"" setting is low enough to keep the room dark. I am, however, disappointed in the quality of sound. I need to find something that is both functional, and has a good set of speakers."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this radio to replace my old Sony Dream Machine which I used in my sons' room to play lullaby CDs at bed time. I was sorely disappointed to learn that this radio does not have a repeat play option for the CD, something I'd expect to be standard on an item in this price point. What a complete waste of money! No repeat play option, no battery back-up, a thorough disappointment!"
2,No battery backup?!,"As a rule Sony makes a great product but the engineers were asleep at the switch with this product. Even the most inexpensive of alarm clocks/clock radios have battery back up and ESPECIALLY with a dual alarm clock (and an aging electrical ""grid"" where you can lose power momentarily on a regular basis) it makes no sense NOT to have battery back up. The radio is no particular hot shakes either but as this is one of the more expensive clock radios (relatively speaking) out there, no battery back up makes it a ""pass it by""."
4,good sound,"Bought this for the nursery....since CD's are going by the wayside, it was tough to find a quality machine, but this fits the bill."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this to replace an old Sony radio/CD alarm clock. The old one was the first CD alarm clock made and it had the most beautiful sound. When I got a Bose player a few years ago, I said it sounded like my Sony. When the old one gave up the ghost, I immediately looked for the same machine. I was so disappointed when I set this one up. The sound was very poor compared with the old one. And this one has a complicated setup. I set it back."
2,Not nearly loud enough,"I got this for my wife. While everything *works* well, the volume is very low. Too low to even listen to music in the bedroom. The buzzer alarm is low as well. Perhaps the unit I bought is defective, if not buy this only if you have VERY good hearing. I'm returning mine and buying something with a volume level we can actually hear."
1,unhappy and frustrated,"this radio worked for about a month, until it was time to change the time for daylight savings. the ""clock set"" button malfunctioned, and since i paid cash for the radio and had no receipt, i called sony directly for help. can you imagine my shock when they said it would be $103 to REPAIR it? are they out of their minds? it's only a $40 item! can you say NEVER AGAIN???"
3,Not what I was looking for,"I wanted a replacement for an old cassette alarm clock to use with my collection of books on tape. I thought that this item would allow me to wake up to my favorite audio books. However, while it is true that you CAN attach an MP3 or cassette player to the machine (useful if your external device doesn't have speakers of its own), you CAN'T connect that external device to the alarm function. (True, it says in the description that the ""alarm works with CD, radio, or buzzer"" while saying nothing about using other attachable devices with the alarm--but I didn't notice this nuance until I tried it myself.) I would have liked a more explicit warning that the alarm doesn't work with other devices.Other than that, it's a good basic alarm/CD player. The sound quality isn't awesome, but I wasn't expecting too much from it. If I hadn't specifically wanted it for the purpose of waking up to my cassettes, I'd probably be satisfied with this item."
3,Good product,"AM/FM radio doesn't come in as clear as I want, but I have it in an enclosed area, so I attribute location for sound. I bought it for the CD and it works great.-sound is also good."
3,Almost There!,"I have not purchased this unit, but studied it closely in a local store. It had all the features I liked except two which is why I am writing: (1) no headphone jack; (2) no battery back-up in case the power goes out. Other than that, I liked the size, price, features, and MP3 line in. Just wish it had two more features."
1,Bad reception,This is misleading information on behalf of the seller. Do not purchase this overpriced dinosaur. It is very large and heavy.The description says am/FM Digital Display Tuner. This is not a digital Tuner or digital display tuner! It is analog.The only digital part of this is the clock. And the stations drift too much to make it worth anything near the cost.It will be returned immediately.
3,not-so dream machine,"Great product, but it missed the most obvious thing after telling the time and waking you up........ the damn battery back up...whats the point of a clock that cant wake you up if the power has gone out.other then that. good audio. good interface."
4,Working Well,"this little clock radio is easy to use and I very much like the way each cd is `inserted'. (fewer parts to break)It is slightly difficult to work out the radio stations and each of their positions- but other then that, the sound is excellent and I am glad I bought this little radio! I also like the really BIG, easily seen numbers for the time."
1,Short Lived,"I owned this cd clock radio for almost 2 years. Yesterday, the cd portion of the radio stopped working. I purchased this radio for the cd player because the previous one I owned died after 11 or 12 years. I'm extremely disappointed with Sony."
2,A seemingly great product with a glaring omission...,"I'm so bummed. I just got home with this clock radio, and I now realize that I have to take it back to the store (not Amazon). I'd researched this product a while back, and I was aware that it didn't have a battery backup at that time, but I saw it in a local retailer here in Dallas, and their shelf tag listed ""battery backup"" as one of the features. I thought, ""Oh, I guess Sony realized the goof and upgraded this model to include the obviously-necessary battery backup."" No such luck, and shame on me for not reading the product box itself to confirm that the feature was present - I didn't, and it ain't. It boggles my mind that a company like Sony has not wised up to such a blatant design flaw in an otherwise excellent product.Oh, well, maybe I'll buy another Emerson Research clock radio - I've had good luck with them, and I don't have to worry if the power fails."
3,Good alarm clock for the price,Found the controls easy enough. The tuner and volume could be placed better. One feature that I thought it have though is random track selection. Wake up track selection is 1-99. Just a little ridiculous for a cd player that does not read mp3s. 1-98 with a R for random or a S for shuffle would have added another star.
1,80's flashback with CD player,"Not worth the price I paid. This thing is straight from the 80's with a CD player attached. Dial tuning, no preset stations, no battery backup. Basically, the only thing ""new"" about this clock is the addition of the CD player but its function is even limited. Returned it as soon as I got it I was so disappointed."
2,Partial Disappointment,"I got this radio last Christmas because I saw the reviews and needed something with a bigger, more legible time display. It's a little quirky in its operation, but my biggest issue with it is that the tuner for the radio is TERRIBLE! We always wake up to the local public radio station, but another station several points further down the dial will leak into the public station's frequency unless the radio is placed just so. It's basically a terrible radio with a great display and decent CD player.Sound quality is nothing to write home about and the digital audio input is too low-powered. I'm living with this unit, but I would NEVER recommend it to anyone else."
2,Sony ICF-CD815 AM/FM Stereo CD Clock Radio with Dual Alarm,Purchase this CD Clock Radio to replace older model that got broken. Very poor sound quality compared to the one where speakers were in front. No headphone jack. Ok if you need clock with large numbers.
3,Radio,Time and alams are very had to set. Still cannot figure how to attach external media. Nice to have dual alarms. CD player is easy to use and sound quality is adequate
5,This is a dream machine!,"Kudos for prompt shipping by Amazon and quick delivery by the U.S. Postal Service. I am very happy with this CD alarm clock. It has everything I was looking for -- easy set-up, time display brightness control, decent sound, CD music to go to sleep by with 90-, 60-, 30- and 15-minutes choices, CD track selection for wake-up, and snooze. It's also stylish and not too large. Now I wake up to Boccherini's Minuet -- a civilized way to start the day."
3,Amazon's Tech details are INCORRECT.,"""CD player with CD-R/RW MP3 playback and digital AM/FM tuner""This implys that it plays MP3's from a CD. It does not.This states specifically that it has a digital tuner. It does not.Sony's web page indicates the actual specs:MP3 Player : Connection via the Audio-in JackTuner Type : AnalogWhile I don't care about the analog tuner (haven't listened to radio since Sirius) its an inaccurate description.One selling point that I wanted was the CD/MP3 playback. This product does not have this."
3,Good and bad - things you should Know before buying....,"I've had this unit for over 6 months overall it works fine but I had to give it to my daughter as there a few annoyances:1. The analog tuner is sensitive - you can tune in a station one night and the next night it has to be adjusted (ever so slightly) again. If reception is important spend for a digital tuner.2. When in the 'OFF' setting, there is a very low 'hum' reminiscent of cheap electronics of 30 years ago. I found this too annoying to remain next to my bed, near my head.3. I thought this unit would play MP3 formatted CDs (it does not), but it only has an AV input (short cord included). I have a Sony boombox in my workshop that does play this format on CD and I find it quite useful.Overall for the price I guess it works fine, just be should you know what you are getting..."
4,Finally found what I wanted!,"I love this clock radio. After purchasing and returning two different clock radios that were too inconvenient to use, I absolutely love this one. It's easy to set up and use, which is key for a person like me with no time to waste fiddling around with my alarm clock! The only surprise was the product size--based on the product picture I thought it had a small footprint, but the clock numbers are really big (I'd say 1.5 - 2"" high) so the overall unit is bigger than I expected. It's worth the real estate, though."
2,Stereo?,"Advertised as a stereo unit, but mentions in the operating instructions under the section entitled ""Playing the radio"", that *This model does not support FM stereo. Is that little misleading?"
1,What bo battery backup!!,"This unit looks great and does all the things that i want, and does them well. BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE BATTERY BACKUP AND IS DIFFICULT TO SET. What a shame in this day and age. I live in a medium size city and with short power outages every week or so this clock becomes useless as an alarm clock - I nees to sell it and get something else!"
3,Sony Dream Machine,"A pretty good clock radio - CD player - Alarm. All functions work as advertised. The time display is large and can be read from across the room, a good thing. The radio controls are located in the side/rear of the unit, making it a little difficult to switch between functions. The control functions are inbedded in the plastic housing, making it a little hard to read, for those of us that are a little older, we have to have our reading glasses on to read the controls. This is to be expected for a realitivaly inexpensive device. The only real complaint that I have with the unit is the sound quality, when playing music, the sound is a little ""tinny"", hardly any bass or midrange. I have an older Sony AM-FM, cassette, ""Dream Machine"", and the sound quality is a whole lot better."
2,Sony Dual Alarm Clock,I am not pleased with alarm clock. It goes off every morning whether I set it or not. I have followed the instructions and did everything that i was told to.The alarm starts even if I set it for CD or radio.
4,Probably the best multi-function alarm clock on the market...,"If you are looking for an alarm clock radio/CD player with an mp3 input jack that has aesthetic appeal, this is the device for you. Very easy to use, sound quality is better than that cheaper Coby or GPX model you've looked at - I mean, it IS a Sony. Alarm is gradual and not annoying like most alarm clocks. Looks great on my nightstand. I highly recommend it!"
2,Sound Quality Not Nearly As Good as 1980s Dream Machine,I have a 30 year old Sony Dream Machine that still works and use it nearly every day. The sound quality of this original 1980s radio is *far* superior to this ICF-CD815. I care about sound quality--life is too short to listen to poor quality sound. I don't believe this unit lives up to the Sony name.
2,"It works just fine, except when it doesn't!","For a CLOCK to be useful, it needs to be easy to set.For an ALARM to be useful, it needs to be easy to set.Mine isn't.Press the labeled and appropriate buttons..........it thinks about it, - no change. Press and release? No change. Power cycle by unplugging from the wall, try try again....no change. Perform an indian rain dance, holding it over your head and chanting.........actually that works, sometimes.REALLY - whatever contacts Sony is using in this clock alarm must corrode real easy, - 'cos it's a GREAT idea.....that i can't use.BTW - Mr. Sony if you ever read reviews of your products, - a battery backup would be a nice touch, plus the ability to read mp3 discs, and a special request.....a line OUT as well as a line IN. You could charge more.....especially if it worked.(CD, audio line in & radio all work just great in case that's enough for you...but as a clock? - naaaaaah)"
4,Very user friendly,"A little pricier than I wanted, but very user friendly. Love the multiple alarms and that you can wake up to any track on the CD. It doesn't get very loud (for my morning routine), but I mainly bought it for the CD alarm feature, so I'm happy. I love the mp3 player option too. Overall great product"
4,Sony CD Clock Radio w/Dual Alarm,Very good product. Was ordered for my husband as a father's day gift. He likes it very much; he says it would be perfect if it also had a battery backup.
4,I am pleased with this product.,"I had a clock radio with alarm, but I live in a valley, and we get spotty radio signals at best. I wanted an alarm clock to play CDs rather than one for my ipod (although this comes with an audio jack, so it may be able to take the ipod as input, I'd have to verify).I have had the clock for a couple of weeks now, and I really like it. The display is configurable to a very dim setting, so it doesn't bug me like the last clock did. It's also a green light, which seems less annoying as well. (The last clock was a red display). The display is very large, and easy to read even when groggy and barely awake. The snooze button could a a little larger, but it works. I like the two alarm options and they can be set to different configurations as far as CD, radio, or buzzer."
3,This is a good product,I really like being able to set two different alarms and the CD player is good for what it is
3,Sony Dream Machine,"The clock and alarm work great, but was disappointed in the radio quality and overall quality of the machine. I had seen one at a hotel and it was of a much better quality."
2,crummy radio,the cd player is fine but the radio sound is tinny and reception is very limited. also the design is clunky and the dials awkward. not a nice item.
3,Surprised and disappointed.......,"Everything is basically fine, but I can't believe it doesn't have a headphone jack. I enjoy listening to CDs at night with my headphones and I can't do that with this radio/player. I'm surprised and quite disappointed that Sony omitted such a run of the mill standard feature."
2,CD player stopped working after 6 months,"I like the big bright display. That's my one ""pro"". Cons, however, are more numerous. Poor controls placement. This is a clock radio, things need to be simple to use by touch. One shouldn't have to turn on the bed-side light to find buttons, etc.... The tuner knob/controller thingy is exactly the same as the volume control and both are hidden around the side of the unit. Again, a real PAIN to access when lights are off...and even when they're on. Then there's the CD player. Won't play a thing now at all. Started doing weird things a few months ago, and now it's dead. Also, no battery backup for utility loss. Surprising to me, given the brand name, which I generally equate w/ good design and quality. Oh well."
1,Disappointed,"While this alarm clock has Ipod capability, it does not charge the Ipod. It also does not have any battery back-up, so every time you move the clock you end up needing to reset the time. Just annoying. This is not a user friendly alarm clock and I am very disappointed with it."
3,Easy on old eyes but dead after just 2 years,That says it ... two years to the month and it won't play a CD. Maybe low price = short life.
2,Audio-in level is too low,"I bought this product because it has a line-in port. The Alarm, Radio, and CD features are common features for Clock Radios, but I also wanted to connect an MP3 player. Everything works as advertised, except that the audio-in level is about 2x lower than the Radio and CD. So, if you want to fall asleep listening to MP3 music, you have to max-out your MP3 player's volume and turn-up the Sony volume. Then when you wake-up to the radio or a CD, it's too loud! I experimented with 2 different cables, an MP3 player, and my cell phone, and the line-in level is just too low. Very disappointing... Sony can build a Playstation, but they can't design a simple clock radio!"
4,My son loves his.,I was somewhat concerned about this unit because a lot of the reviews had negative comments mainly about the life of the CD player. There were not any better choices so I ordered it anyway. I like being able to pick which track I want to wake up to and I like the two alarms. It turns out my son has had one of these for quite a while and he loves it.
2,Item Returned,"The unit is BIG and clunky. There is no display on the front to show what channel you are on. It is very cumbersome to use, especially when changing channels. You have to turn it on it's side to figure out how to do anything."
2,Poor sound quality,I have had this for almost 2 years now and I think it was a waste of money. It functions fantastic as an alarm clock but the sound quality for music is terrible! I was a little surprised to find it had a dial for the volume control and also a dial for radio tuning. A bit old school for the digital world we live in today. You can't just tune it to 102.7 or whatever station number you are looking for. You have to move the dial a little this way or that to find the station you want.It does have an input to hook up your mp3 but again the sound quality is still horrible.I expected more from Sony.
2,No repeat functionality!,"Somehow I missed the other reviews that mentioned the lack of repeat feature on this CD player. My entire reason for CD player shopping is an infant who likes to sleep to ocean waves, so not having the repeat function is a dealbreaker. The volume is very muted when using an ipod and the enclosed patch cable as well. My second Amazon return ever!"
2,Alarms are not loud enough,"This is a good unit other than the fact that I can barely hear the alarm in the morning. Seeing as the alarm is the main purpose of an alarm clock, this unit is a fail. Also, the sound quality from CD player is pitiful."
2,Disappointing,"Yeah, all the features it mentions are nice, and the clock face is easily seen.However, no backup means that I'm resetting the clock frequently. As well, they put the volume control in a place that is hard to access and can be maddening to find.Also, and worst of all since I used it just about every day for about half an hour, the CD player stopped working after only two years. I took excellent care of it, never moved it, but it broke anyway. This means that I now must buy another one -- but rest assured it will not be a Sony Dream Machine."
1,Did not play Cds,This player was faulty - it would not spin to play cds. Great disappointment for my 3 year old granddaughter as she listens to a cd to get to sleep at night.
2,Not recommended for a music lover or NPR listener,"Could not get my NPR music and news stations, and sound quality unsatisfactory. Clock and alarm were fine. I will buy an alarm clock and get my news and music from my stereo.."
4,Tone is very good.,"It's one of the best-sounding CD players I've heard. The only bad thing about it is no battery back-up. I knew this going in, though."
4,Does the trick,"Product has some attractive features: limited number of buttons and dials, very legible display, decent sound. The controls to fall asleep to your favorite station or CD are easy to use and accessible on the top of the unit. However, the controls for AM/FM tuning are a little inconvenient, tucked in the back right side of the device. And getting in stations is a challenge because the analog signal frequency display is also tucked in the back right side of the device, it's very small, and the slightest movement of the dial covers a lot of frequency ground. But once you get a station, it comes in clear and strong. Overall, a worthwhile clock radio with CD capabilities."
4,Finally,I shopped both in physical stores and online for over a month before I found this cd/radio alarm clock. This one has the dual alarm features as well as the CD alternative to radio and annoying beeping that I absolutely hate on any alarm clock. The only drawback is that it does not have battery back-up in case of electricity failure during the night.
4,Good,"I liked the quality and working as expected. but only annoying part is if you remove it from outlet and put it back, you will loose time and alarm settings. I have 2 years old, his intersting job is that."
3,Hard to reach controls,"I am quite disappointed in this Sony product. The volume control dial is located in the extreme back right side of the radio/cd player....and this makes it quite difficult to reach if in bed and it is on a nightstand. Not logically placed. The volume should be the first control knob, THEN the channel selector. Also, when playing a CD at a lower volume, you can hear it spinning round and round. Very annoying if you are trying to fall asleep to the music."
2,just awful.,"i've had this radio for quite a while. the first thing i noticed almost immediately was their is no battery backup... i looked and looked for a door and finally disassembled it thinking it HAD to be inside somewhere... i mean nobody would make a clock-radio without one >.>then i realized that close radio frequencies in FM like 105.3 and 105.5 will overlap and you cant listen to just one without garbled junk from the other station or really annoying buzzing static.then theirs the switches on the side for the alarm, which are confusing to operate at night in the dark, and are easily switched off by a pet climbing on it, or a flailing arm in the night... the CD player also wakes me up spinning the CD long before the music starts playing.i wouldn't touch this radio... ill be buying a different one with a digital radio tuner and a backup battery very soon since i keep missing bob and tom, and a small brownout will leave me sleeping till the boss calls wondering where the heck i am...."
2,Not as represented,Radio does not have DIGITAL RADIO TUNER - if I could can find the box I'd like to return the product.
2,Lacks battery backup and digital radio tuner and has a tiny out of sight manual radio dial,"I read the positive reviews on this Sony so I thought I would buy it for my 18 year old daughter who is going off to college in about a month. While this Sony does sound good and has a decent alarm, CD player, and MP3 input, the radio is not only analog, but the dial is off to the side is very tiny. It also has no battery backup!!! If listening to the radio and tuning in stations is not important to you I say go ahead and buy this clock radio. I expected that the radio part of this clock radio would have been much easier to both see and use for the price."
2,"Good, but some big flaws","I really like this alarm clock, but it has some major flaws.Pros: Being able to wake up to a song is really awsomeThe display is very visable at nightDual alarm system is handy if you have a schedual that you regularly get up at different timesCons: No battery backup (This is a must, because the house power in most places flickers at least once a month and resets the alarm)I gave it a two, becasue I need a batery backup. I had to buy one to use this alarm and that is annoying"
1,Looks Nice. BEWARE! NO BATTERY BACK-UP & Poor Tuner capability,"BEWARE!!!This is a great looking clock radio, but if you've previously relied upon a clock radio with a battery back up, look elsewhere.MORE WARNINGS!!!The sound is good, and having a CD player is also nice, but if you want a specific station, this is also not a good radio for you. It has a dial at the right hand side with numbers etched into it, however it's not very accurate, and mine has bounced between stations 101.1 & 101.5 frequently (on its own of course).I took mine back, but would have gladly paid $10 more for a similar product with a battery back up, and better ability to hold a station.I'm simply looking to pass my misfortunes along to the community, in hopes of saving anyone else the same aggravation. Best of luck!"
3,Can't Repeat Play a CD,"I bought this so I could listen to subliminal tapes softly all night, but since it doesn't have a repeat play, it will only play a CD once. Not what I was looking for. It's kinda bulky, not real attractive. But on the good side, the sound quality is good and the numbers are really LARGE. I'm returning it for a programmable one, which is cheaper. Wish me luck. All these electronics are Made in China, and they all suck to some extent, but there seems to be no other choice."
1,Incorrect Product Description,"Your ""Technical Details"" section states that this product has a ""Digital AM/FM Stereo tuner."" The radio portion of this product is pure analog.I would not have made this purchase had it been described correctly. I am returning it unused (had to open it to discover the problem). I'd appreciate your reimbursing the return shipping cost."
3,"Good clock radio, needs more features","I really like this clock radio. I do miss battery backup and the CD function has no repeat... my son likes a cd to play through the night, but it only goes through once. Sound is great, ability to hookup mp3 is neat and the numbers are super easy to read at night!"
4,Perfect for a small space,"Great little clock radio/cd player with dual alarm. Easy to use and has a good sound quality. Finding the tuner was a bit difficult, since it's on the side. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
3,Complex and confusing controls,"The title says it. I was tempted to title it ""Usual Sony Junk"" as it's not the first Sony product that has just crapped out for me early in its life. In this case, the CD no longer spins or plays.Also, I found the controls quite complex and niggly -- poor UI is the modern term. But finally having mastered that, it broke. Now it's just a bulky clock and traditional alarm.Not recommended.------------------Addendum -- it had not stopped working. I was just unable to activate the CD because of the confusing controls. I am still using it as a clock, but not as a CD -- until I have a spare hour to figure out how to use it and write down the steps so I don't forget."
4,like it a lot,"I got this alarm clock so I could wake up to sounds of nature, not heart attack alarms. Since you can wake up to a cd track, it is great. I didn't think about the lack of battery back-up, which would be better to have. But since so many are concerned about power outages, says something about the state of our infrastructure, doesn't it."
4,Easy to use - good sound,"I bought this CD player/radio for my 84-year-old father for Christmas. I especially like its ease of use. There is no remote control to misplace or tiny buttons to try to read. The manual buttons are large enough for him to see clearly.The sound quality is good for a CD player in this price range.Since he uses this product mostly for his music CD's, I cannot comment on the radio and alarm features."
1,Not Impressed,I got this as a Christmas present and am going to take it back. The sound quality is poor (even for a portable cd player) and there is a slight buzzing noise coming from it all the time.
4,"Screechy, but Good Alarm Clock","This is a very nice clock\CD player, but if you tell the clock to wake you up with a CD, it starts with a screech before the first song starts. The volume control is hard to see because it is hidden in the back of the clock. I recommend you get this clock, but there may be nicer clocks."
2,DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY!,"This radio gets such poor reception sometimes it simply ""blinks"" out. You think you lost power or the radio died but then it comes back on. Also when I had it plugged into one of my kitchen outlets I would get static whenever the automatic outdoor light would go on. I had to move it to another room. I bought two because of the price and I wanted a radio for each room. It is huge--way too big. Finding a clear signal for a particular station is also difficult. Like I said in the title, don't waste your money!"
3,Just what I needed,I needed a reliable clock radio with large numbers. The fact it has a Cd player is a plus. The price was right. It met my needs and is easy to program.
3,Nice clock cd player,"Works great, my only ,disappointment was the lack of an output jack for earphones. I listen to audios at night and use earphones so as not to disturb my husband. I assumed all products of this kind had one since previous cheaper ones did, so ordered what I considered a better quality. The Sony is a great product however it is missing the one feature I needed most."
3,Decent...,"Not a bad clock radio from Sony. I had a Dream Machine AM/FM radio before this. I received this model as a present from my mother.Sound wise this is nothing spectacular. I listen to books on tape on it, while I'm trying to get to sleep. I also listen to a lot of NPR as well.CD playback is pretty basic. Sound is very average.No digital tuner!! Just the old thumb breaking dial you must twirl back and forth searching the stations.Nice bright display though, with adjustable dimmer, so you can almost turn it off when you are tired of seeing green.Buzzer is loud on alarm, and I like the 2 different alarms built in. Over all not a back clock radio, with the ability to play music at non thrilling levels.There are better options out there for music playback if that is your desire. But if your like me and just like simple things, this is a good purchase. Don't pay too much for this though, wait for a sale.-Hope this helps."
2,NO BATTERY BACK UP,"Why in the world would you not have a battery back up? Living in the Mid West you're going to have weekly if not daily power ""flashes"" where the power goes out for a split second or maybe even days. It's annoying to reset the clock all the time. I mean, seriously."
2,Buyer beware -- no battery backup,"Like several others reviewers, I also missed the fact that this item does not have a battery backup! I bought it because I thought the CD and mp3 functions would be pretty neat. Never in a million years did I think that it would not have a battery backup. It is an alarm clock, after all.I would return it if it wasn't such a hassle. Plus, I did give it 2 stars instead of 1 because everything else works good. It is a nice little radio, just a poor alarm clock. Maybe I will plug it into my computer's battery backup if there is a spot."
1,No battery backup ... HUGE flaw,"There is no battery backup which is unbelievable. Every other alarm clock I have used has battery backup. I really can't understand how Sony could miss this. It doesn't even matter if this is the best alarm clock in the world ... if it does not tell the right time when the power goes out or wake me up on time if there was a power outage throughout the night, it is useless. I'm actually pretty upset about this because this is a big waste of time and I'm returning it immediately."
1,No Battery Backup = Not Worth Considering,"If it is unplugged, or there is a power interruption, for just two seconds, it forgets the current time and both alarm settings. I bought one at Best Buy and returned it the same day once I found that out. I would rate this ""Not Acceptable""."
1,"Extremely disappointed with the radio functions,",This radio has no radio presets and only a small unlit combination AM-FM dial hidden on the side. The CD function worked fine but any attempt to use the radio was very discouraging. Returned the unit an acquired an upgraded Sony unit that is perfect for my use.
2,Didn't hold up,Enjoyed it while it worked but it stopped playing CD's after about a year. Still functions as an alarm clock but I needed the CD for sleep therapy CD's. Will have to keep shopping.
2,Dual alarm -- misleading,"The item is advertised as ""dual alarm"" with CD, radio and Buzzer modes. What is not advertised is that BOTH alarms must be set the same way (CD or radio or buzzer). This is not what SONY meant by ""Dual alarm"" the last time I bought a similar item. It is useless to me."
4,I like it but...,"I really like this alarm clock. My only regret is that the radio is dial, and it is hard to find the station. Wish it was digital display."
4,Glad I boutht it,This radio-CD player is compace enought to join the other items on my husband's bedside table -- I looked through a lot before I found one that was. His only negative comment is that the instructions weren't very helpful. But he figured it out and is enjoying having his music whenever he is in the bedroom.
4,A Great Buy for the Price,I bought this Radio/CD player for my kitchen as I also like to play my favorite CD's while cooking! I read several reviews on different brands and decided to try this one as the price was so reasonable. I will say the quality is amazing for the price! I also got free shipping which made it an even better buy. It's neat and compact for a shelf space. The delivery process was very fast too...so I will do a lot more shopping on Amazon!!
2,Ridiculous,We have an RCA one similar to this and love it so we wanted one like it. We returned this one right away. It is so large and looks completely ridiculous. The clock display is simply huge and the system was bulky. We went ahead and found the much smaller (and even cheaper) RCA one.
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","I readily paid more for this item over some of its competition on the basis of the Sony name alone. Over the years, I've come to trust Sony implicitly. Boy, was I fooled this time.I purchased this as an upgrade for my son's room so he could utilize his mp3 player as well as play CDs. From the get-go, he had trouble figuring it out--and this is one high tech kid. The controls are awkwardly placed, awkward to use, etc., as others have pointed out. But it got the job done, if not elegantly. And the sound quality was decent--not great, but not horrible, and certainly loud enough (unlike another reviewer stated).But a month or so ago, less than a year after we purchased the unit, the CD player stopped working. I went online looking for answers, only to find that others had the same problem. Wow. Forty bucks down the drain.This will definitely have me thinking twice about Sony in the future. Very disappointing."
1,Appalling sound quality,"Not much better than an old cheap transistor radio in sound quality. I bought it to listen to CDs at bedtime, but I can't bear to hear music on it. A very regrettable purchase. I'm replacing it asap."
3,Disappointed,"I wanted a bedside cd player and, radio. The picture and product description seemed to fit the bill. It did not. There is no jack for ear buds. I especially wanted this feature for late night listenning not to disturb my mate. What player doesn't have an ear phone jack? Very odd especially for SONY. Also, the radio dial is this tiny hard to read and access circular knob. The stations do not appear on the lcd read out ONLY the time IN HUGE NUMBERS - TOO HUGE FOR MY TASTES. On the plus side - its attractive and the sound is quite good for a tabletop. The price is also very good. Had this cost more, I would have definetly sent it back for a refund."
4,I like it for the most part,"This has a lot of great features - dual alarm, big adjustable brightness display, CD player and MP3 port. My only compaint is a lack of battery back up. When you lose power, you have to reset the clock all over again. Oh well."
5,A happy camper,"I have purchased other products in the past and eventually something does not function properly, so I decided buy what I consider a reputable brand. I have owned Sony products and have never been disappointed. The item arrived sooner than expected and the instructions were very clear, so the set up was easy. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend ."
3,Could be better for the price,"I purchased this product a couple of years ago for our toddlers room. The sound is great from the speakers, and you can play radio, cd, and ipod. However, for the price it is setup poorly. The volume control is way in the back, and there is no battery back up. Come on sony. For the price, it should have a battery back up for when the power goes out."
2,Decent but DIED,"I bought a Sony ICF CD-815 for my son for Christmas. Worked well, has dual speakers and generally easy to program. All was well until the other night (6 months after purchase) when my son said it wouldn't play CDs any more. Checked out CD's - were OK, cleaned the CD player lens - seemed fine before cleaning, still would not play. CD player makes sounds like the heads are searching and not finding music tracks. CD lamp probably died.3 month warrantee, CD player dead at 6 months.Not what I'd call a high quality unit. From what I read of reviews, this is not an unusual experience. Some die quickly, some take a bit longer than the warrantee period. Some last longer. Like I told my son, ""I'm sorry, that is a big bummer!"""
2,"Worked great for 13 months, then died","Bought this stereo CD player for the CD playing mostly.The sound quality was good for the price. Never used the radio much.13 months later, the CD player died. End of story."
3,limited function,I bought this for the clock and CD features for my son. I play CD to put him to sleep but did not realize the function is limited. It doesn't have the random or repeat function so it stops after the CD is done. I can't play the music all night for him. It is very basic but not very cheap. It is also bigger than what the picture shows so takes up room on the desk. It is also not very quiet but the display is large enough to see at night.
2,"you get what you pay for, mostly","This is a product I'd have returned if I thought I could do any better for the price, but it looks like I probably wouldn't and it's better than the broken, old clock radio it's replacing. Cosmetically it's not very attractive; the black-and-white look is clunky without being retro or even ironic. Controls for brightness and volume are in the far back of the chassis, making these adjustments inconvenient when I'm in bed struggling to set things up properly. The radio is a weak, crude analog setup that does not pick up most of the (large, powerful) stations I listen to. But the variable snooze is a nice feature, the numbers are easy to read, and I like having two alarms. No battery backup; an input for mp3 players is strangely placed in the front of the chassis (where volume control by rights ought to be). Far from a perfect product but perfection is rarely purchased for this price."
5,CD Clock Radio Review,CD Clock Radio was received only two days after order was placed and works perfectly. It's just what I was looking for and couldn't find it anywhere else. Would definitely order from this vendor again.
3,Seems to be a good clock thus far.,The clock arrived and it apperas to be a good alarm clock. The sound quality isn't the greatest but it is after all a clock. Not sure about all of its features as I have to read the book.
4,Mine doesn't take batteries!,"Table top CD players are getting to be hard to find. I wanted one to play a sleep hypnosis disk and this looked like the best ""value"" available. No complaints so far (after 2 nights). If it doesn't hold up I'll sure be back here bitchin' about it."
1,20 year-old technology,"An analog tuner with ""invisible"" tuning dial, audio CD playback with no MP3 disc capability, terrible tuning selectivity, tinny speakers, no battery backup, and a size that takes up 90% of the night stand... I think I had a clock radio that was this ""modern"" back in mid-80's.I had this out of the box for only about five minutes. The sound was terrible, the tuner would get a grand total of four FM stations (two of them only with distortion), the tuning knob and dial are around the side so you must pick up the unit to tune it. The alarm choice (buzzer/radio/etc.), the tuning band selector, the tuning knob, and the volume control are all analog and are on the side. You can see only the time from the front panel. All other functions are around the side of this too-big unit.I returned it immediately. I am looking now for a clock radio that was designed in the 21st Century!"
1,I need help to return this,I have had such wonderful experiences with Amazon but recently when I order a product that is not from Amazon directly there are problems.This unit was fine for 3 days but now plays 3/4ths of a cd and then skips. I tried the cd on my office unit and it was fine.I need to return this but am not certain how to.Coud you assist me?
3,Its OK except for the radio,"I bought this because it had everything I wanted.. radio, alarm, cd player and especially the line-in port. It all works fine and is suitable for personal use. The only problem is the radio is manually tuned and this can become very annoying. Also, the tuning button is situated to the side where it is difficult to see and get to a desired station."
4,Good buy but slightly awkward interface,"It is a nice cd radio clock combo which allows external input. Some of the controls are rather oddly placed (the volume is all the way toward on the back, on the right side; the selection of the external input is not visually compelling - you do have to pay attention when you activate it)."
2,It is okay for a clock,Nice display for a clock but too hard to manipulate controls for other use. Waste of money as far as I am concerned.
3,Poor design,"This is perfect for a preschooler. There's not much here except poorly designed controls and NO EARPHONE JACK!!! Put in cd, it play with tinny sound, clock numbers BIG for Sesame Streeter. I wish they'd said something in the product specifications (Amazon, that is) about NO EARPHONE JACK! Save your money. Don't buy Sony."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"We got this for my sons' room so they could wake up to a CD instead of an obnoxious alarm on school days. Frankly, it just isn't that great. It does work, most of the time. But then, once in a while, the CD won't play. It acts like there's no CD in the player, and it defaults to the buzzer alarm. Then, next time, it will probably work again.In general, the look and feel is super cheap. It sort of gives the impression of having been hastily slapped together by a depressed laborer in a prison factory."
2,Not the Best Sony,"As a owner of an earlier Sony Dream Machine, this falls a little short. There is no battery back-up for the time. Also the radio does not really support MP3, you can play mp3 files through the aux input, but the CD player does NOT play MP3 CDs. I tried recording the MP3 files in a number of formats and dircetory structures, nothing worked. The only good news is that Amazon has an excellent return policy. Bottom line I still have faith in Amazon as a vendor, but this radio is not much more than that."
2,DOES NOT play MP3 CD's,"I primarily purchased this so I could load up discs of mp3 music to play, guess what it doesn't do? It does have an input for an mp3 player, which is either what they meant in regard to playing mp3 files, or they just lied. I'm really disappointed that it doesn't do the one thing that I was buying it to do.It has a ""digital tuner"", ummm this doesn't mean what most people would think it means. You don't tune the radio digitally, you have a scroll wheel on the side that is almost as oddly placed as the volume button which is even further back near the bottom.It does tell time, it seems pretty good on that account. Had it verbally abused me I would feel worse about this product, but since it didn't I'll give it an extra star."
2,Not for me...,"It seems like a very nice alarm clock with all the features I was looking for, however, I am a very heavy sleeper (usually takes 2 clock alarms and one cell alarm to wake me). As soon as I tried out the buzzer alarm I knew this one wouldnt work for me. The buzzer is actually a beep which does increase its frequency as time passes but not the volume (which i wouldve found more helpful). The beep wouldnt wake me up but might for a person who doesnt sleep so freakishly deep :P I thought it would be nice to have a CD feature to fall asleep to some ambient music. When I tried to play and stop a CD it made this horrible buzzing sound, it seemed like it was one of the wheels inside the player. It would be ok if it happened only when play was pressed but it did it also when the CD stopped which would wake me up. I returned it to the store and bought an Emerson instead. The Sony I bought might have been the one in a thousand that is defective. *shrug*"
3,CD Clock Radio,The only feature I'd like to see is NOT having the CD restart from top of track 1 every time it is used as an alarm. It should pick-up where I stopped it.
2,"Caveat Emptor, Buyer Beware!","Sony has been my preferred brand for years, but this product has been a disappointment. I recently purchased several of these for our house, and of the four I purchased, 2 had CD players which did not work. I so trust Sony that I assumed that I had had a technological brain freeze and it was my error. But, the CD players simply do not work.Of course, since I trust Sony so much I had disgarded the packaging. The radio/time functions work great, but still an expensive lesson."
4,Very nice alarm clock with CD player,"I really like this unit, but like the others, I wish it had a battery back-up. The CD player is nice and we use it mainly for our two young daughters to go to sleep with at night. The sound is not going to fill a room with sonorous delight, but for the size and price of the unit, it is pleasantly surprising as it neither gets lost in low volume nor distorts when the unit is turned up. As others have stated, the tuning control is poor and probably the least desirable aspect of this unit if you like to listen to the radio. The volume and tuning controls are inconvenient as well. But the big, green numbers are fantastic and the ease of use make it the type of unit I would like to put in every bedroom in the house."
1,Don't buy if you need to wake up on time,"This is a good radio/CD player with a major inexcusable design flaw. There is no battery so if you lose power, you lose the time. How Sony made an alarm clock without thinking of this I don't understand."
2,English Version lacks,"SImply put the English Version lacks the development. After watching the Japanese Version and seeing the episodes the English Version misses I'm dissapointed, but still watch because I'm a DBZ and DBGT fan."
3,too short and too different,"but da brat executive produced it, so it showed a different, mature side.best songsworld premiere w/mopchuchgushy wushyaint got time to wasteunrestricted is her best LP"
3,"Just to clear up the origin of the song ""Boom""...","After reading through these reviews, I see that a few people do not know that the song ""Boom"" is based on ""BOOM! I Got Your Boyfriend"" by MC Luscious, a hip-pop/dance song from around 1992. This song had a remix which changed the lyrics to ""boom I F'd your boyfriend,"" which is the part used by Da Brat in her song. Check out the MC Luscious video on Launch if you are curious. Anyway, I think that this is a pretty good album overall, although not as good as her earlier ones. She's still one of the most talented rappers out there."
3,"Brat, you let me down on this one.","This is without a doubt Brat's worst album. I was pumped for it because of the song ""In Luv Wit Chu"". And because 'Unrestricted' was banging. But when I heard it, I was sorely disappointed. The beats were mediocre and she seems to have shyed away from the hard image her fans have fallen in love with. Now I ain't gonna lie, there are some good songs on here: ""In Luv Wit Chu"", ""Boom"", ""Gushy Wushy"", and ""Got It Poppin'"", but other than that....it's just not HER. I hope her next one is MUCH better."
4,Anutha Brat Fan,"As usual the Da Brat hits you with a little originality,a splash of ole school and a dash of A.T.L and Chi-town. The album is a brilliant tribute to the Veteran rappers such as M.C.Lyte, Salt n Pepa, and L.L.Cool J. With lyrics like ""When I retire, I'll be worshipped like an old battleship"", Brat was obviously feeling like giving thanks to the predecessors. There are hits such as ""WHO I AM""(a definite banger),""BOOM"" (a salt n pepa re-make),""GOT IT POPPIN'""(Brat Club Banger),""Gushy Wushy""(another hit-in-the making).The CD also has a cee-lo styled number classically named ""CHUCH"". I was about to sleep on this album myself because it was not the typical Brat CD. The Cd is ""LIKE DAT"" so ""GO COP DAT DISC and DVD!"".She has also blessed her fans with an entertaining DVD. I would like to hear a couple of remixes and more videos from these great tracks."
3,"her flow,and the last 5 songs saved this cd","she needs more tracks like the last 5 the first 6 tracks are dull,underwhelming and dry.the production is deader than a door knob,the cd doesn't pick up till the last five tracks,where she shreds the cd to pieces!! with her toungu twisting flow!.those songs were the saving grace for this album.good thing it was short because if their was 4 or 5 more bad tracks this would have been a two star cd."
2,Not a hit,"I dont know what happened. She had 3 stunning hot albums then she came with this junk. I don't like this one at all. I guess all artists, (not just music) have their highlight years and then fall off. Hopefully she will come back on top. I always loved her, but after hearing this one, I don't know.........."
3,Solid album from a original artist,"First of all this is a pretty good album, i never heard that much about it when it came out but it's really solid. Most songs are good, Da Brat got her own style, she's original. Good beats and samples and good hooks on many songs. There aren't any fillers either, only 11 songs so you won't get tired of her while you listen. There are 2 songs that i really enjoy here. ""In Love Wit Chu"" (featuring Cherish) a smoth ballad mixed with Da Brat's tough flow. The other one is "" I was the one"" with Anothony Hamilton. I remember the sample, i've heard it somewhere but can't remember from which song. ""Gotta thing for you"" is also solid and it includes Mariah Carey, strange enough i never heard much about it. Most others are also enjoyable, with a few exceptions. A solid album that never got the credit it credit have had."
3,"OK, but not as good as Unrestricted","I got hooked on Da Brat a few years ago when Unrestricted came out. She's the best of the female rappers - after you hear her, Li'l Kim and even Missy sound amateurish. It's a pity that this album doesn't measure up to Unrestricted - in fact, this CD is far less sophisticated than Da Brat's last. It doesn't have the bass heavy dance floor songs that I like best from Da Brat. It's not a weak album; it's just not as strong as I hoped it would be."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I am beyond disappointed with this CD. Da Brat's last CD was one of the hottest in my collection of over 500 CD's so of course I couldn't wait to bang this one. I just purchased it 3 days ago and listened to it 3 times and already put it on my rack of CD's I very seldom listen to. Her beats all sound the same and are just plain ""DRY"" and her rhyming style [is bad]! Her voice on one song called ""Boom"" is very irritating as she repeats over and over ""Boom, I got yo boyfriend"". Bottom line, DON'T WASTE YO MONEY!"
2,2.5 Stars,"No Improvement from the last album. Limelite, Luv & Niteclubz is just mindless rap music. NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Not what was expected,I ordered this for a christmas gift and the description online said that it had lights for reverse and my son-in-law looked at it and did not see that this was true. I could have bought a similar item locally without back up lights and not paid shipping and handling. Not a deal breaker but dissapointed.
5,Great collection!,This installment of the dream dance series contains many great songs from several years ago... I bought this CD after I had purchased some of the more recent installments in the Dream Dance series. It was definitely worth it! Great to listen to at high volumes!
4,Sturdy stand,"The stand is very sturdy and it has a nice paint finish.Just be sure to attach the 6 plastic caps for the ends of the tubes with silicone or some other adhesive.Heavy wind and rain causes the caps to blow away, so if the caps are not adhered with adhesive then the inside of the tubes become rusty and an eye sore."
3,Hear Kenny Sing!,"I'm breaking with the pack on this one. I love Kenny Burrell; he is one of the greatest jazz guitarists who has ever lived. But this cd is very different than his other cd's. Not only does he sing on this cd, but he even takes the Monk classic 'Round Midnight, adds lyrics to the song, and sings that song too. I guess its new, creative and different; but I must be a traditionalist because I couldn't listen to it."
2,"Good movie, DVD not","Lets face: its a nice movie (Soap Opera style) with a outstanding cast: Ty Hardin, Shelley Winters, Claire Bloom, Efrem Zimbalist jr., Andrew Duggan and a nice movie score. In other words: i like this movie.But very dissapointing: the picture quality. Its very very corny (its grainy through the whole movie) and I would say not acceptable - the movie deserves a better quality.Also there no subtitles.In other words: I don't like the DVD"
2,A book for aspiring young scientists,"I'd hoped for diagrams for a variety of paper airplanes, but that's not what the book's about.Instead, it deals mostly with the physics of flight. It does suggest useful, inexpensive experiments for those with a scientific bent."
3,Shafted by Amazon,"An interesting read that provides insite into political behavior. The purchase could have been far better if Amazon would have attached the free supplemental with purchase of the text: Theiss-Morse, et al. 2011. Political Behavior in Midterm Elections, 2011 Edition, Washington, DC: Congressional Quarterly Press."
1,This is a complete waste of money,"Take it from me: spend your $35 elsewhere. Go buy some cd's or go to the movies or something, but don't buy this book. If you have any common sense at all when it comes to politics, you won't need this. Pages are spent just simply repeating that Democrats are viewed as liberals and Republicans are viewed as Conservatives. Chart after chart after chart will tell you how minorities tend to vote Democrat, white men tend to vote Republican, and white women tend to vote more Democratically. That is, if you can even read the charts. Every chart--literally--is different from all the rest. They all have a completely different format from each other, and some of them make absolutely no sense. This was a total waste of my money (thanks a lot, Social Science H1F at UCI). Read an opinion poll and it will tell you basically everything you would learn in this book."
1,Mother of God!,"Worst of all time. Flanigan and Zingale just defecated on my face with this pile of waste. My life has been wasted, I feel raped and alone. Watch CNN during election time and gather everything you ever need to know about the material in this book."
1,Garbage what a mess,"After living with The Road Home for the last 8 years this is a severe dissapointment. Road Home is a brilliant recording using old technology. This is a muddled mess using the lates DSD technology which should have been brilliant. I was really looking forward to this knowing how good The Road Home is. This is really that bad. Lots of cash for a big mess. The concert could have been good, but you cant tell from this SACD. Its like listening to AM radio, and far too much crowd noise. THIS IS A SEVERE RIPP OFF."
1,Strictly for Simpletons,"If you are a dummy with no life experience, intellect or common sense you may find this useful. I want to point out firstly that all the other reviews are FAKE. They were all written on the same day or mere days apart and from the syntax are almost certainly written by the same ""reviewer"".Sometimes people write books just to be able to say that they wrote ""a book"" which makes them a published ""author"".This is one of those books. Lots of truisms, common sense knowledge. Absolutely nothing new. Not even worth the $1.50 you can get it for now and given the price it's selling for you can see for yourself how effective the advice on ""INFINITE WEALTH"" was. Nice try. Next."
3,Better but needs improvements in the mixing,"The whole song collection of the CD is fine. But, somehow, it kind of lost something in the sound equalization. I know the reverse was true in the ""Life's Rich Pageant"" import. But unlike the original US release, Stipe's voice sounds more mute and hard to hear. I don't know whether it's because it was recorded in England where the standards in mixing are different. But I felt that the vocals needed to be lifted more if ever so slightly."
5,R.E.M.'s Best Work,"""Fables of the Reconstruction"" was the album that convinced me to make the *jump* from ""classic"" rock to alternative in 1985. Not only is this my favorite REM album, it's my favorite ALBUM--period.Fables is beautiful; dark, deep, lush... (kinda like kudzu) it's easy to get lost in Michael's stories of the South, while simultaneously being hypnotized by Peter Buck's jangling Rickenbocker-picking sound. Buck's playing takes the listener for a Byrd's-esque train ride on Driver 8, the album's standout track. This is the song that would influence everything I'd listen to for the next ten years-- it was THE point of comparison.Michael Stipe is at his peak vocally on this album, and Peter Buck would never sound this good again. Not to mention Mike Mills' harmonies and Bill Berry's solid drumming--If you're new to REM, you REALLY owe it to yourself to listen to this one.Before they changed their sound in 1988, they were the best band in the world. Check 'em out."
3,guitargod,"The music is great,although the vocals suck,I think scott is an amazing guitarist,but really needs to find a good vocalist!The vocals make this recording average.It really shocks me that musicians who play at this level of expertise allow such poor vocals on their recordings.With a good singer this cd is 5 stars all the way!"
3,.....not soo good!!!!,"I have heard scott henderson for three times live in Italy,two times in Rome and one time in Forl&#65533; and i have all his ""blues-band"" cd.......so I can say one thing...this is the worst live performance of scott that I ever heard...may be was an bad night for him....whatever scott, you are always the best!!!"
3,Interesting But Be Warned!,"Be warned that this guide isn't accurate as it should be. For example, on one page it states that you have to win the Rainbow Badge to get the Bulbasaur from the Pokemon Collector in Pokemon Yellow. You only need the Cascade Badge which you get in Cerulean City.Another problem is the sequential order they use for the walk through which makes following it difficult and confusing. It would be better to have a step by step walk through rather than one that was so confusing as to mislead the readers.Besides these problems plus the map of one of the areas in the game being somewhat hard to read, the book is a fair read but my suggestion is that the buyer should be ware."
4,David's Review,I think the book is good because I needed a little help on Gameboy sometimes. It helps you get from place to place on the Pokemon Gameboy walkthrough.
1,This book is outdated.,"This book must have been written a long time ago, becuase it only has Pokemon #1-151 (Mew is spelled Myu) and only has information on the Red/Blue/Yellow versions. There are three versions that don't have guides, and they are the gold/silver/crystal."
4,student reviews,This is the first time I have used a text book with the NIV translation as the base. This book has been a good text book and very well researched. Do recommend this book to anyone needing to further their studies in this subject matter.
4,GRRRRRRREAT!!!!!,"Aside from the sounds that quickly died and were quite annoying, My 5 year-old loves it.He recieved it 1.5 years ago and still plays with it on a weekly basis. And now the real clincher him and his baby brother, age 1.5, love to play this together. Overall this is a wonderful Thomas the Tank item that takes lots of abuse but shows little to no wear."
3,Ok cover for the money.,"The cover is made of good material, but it's not a custom fit. Don't be fooled by the picture it doesn't fit quite that good!I do think it was worth the money and it will protect fairly well."
4,Good cover...Easy to use,"Perfect cover to keep interior dry overnight from dew or even a light shower which is all I was looking for. I take my soft top off in the spring and don't put it back on until late fall (North Carolina)so unless we have heavy rain/storms forcasted, this cover is just what I needed. I have only had it one season but it still appears to be in good shape."
1,Poor quailty,First time using cover it tore because of the material being thin . Would recommend going with a better brand.
2,Bad cover,"I have only had this cover for 10 months and the top layer is already deteriating from the sun. When I take the cover off of my jeep, it is coverd with the top layer of fabric. The good thing is that it fits nicely.Not worth the money."
2,"Ok, but not great","This cover does indeed fit Jeep TJ Wrangler models. It's pretty easy to get on and off.That's the main problem. Even with the security cable attached and strapped down tightly, this cover blows off the car too easily.This cover has spent more time off my Jeep than on it due to the fact that even slight winds can blow the cover off. I don't live in a particular windy area.As for functionality as a cover, it seems to be good at keeping the elements out, when it's still on the car that is."
3,Good cover for money. Lasted 15 months.,"For the price, it does what it is designed to do. It lasted about 1 year. Warranty is for 90 days. For $60 it is much cheaper than renting a garage. Goes on and off easy. No point in locking it for the same reason I never lock a soft top jeep. Opens easy with a quick slice. Elastic around the bottom is still good. Material on top has lost it's underlining after 1 year and outer material now rips easy.Bottom line $60 for 1 year of use. Not Horrible, Not Great."
3,Rampage Car Cover,Arrived on time. Seems to be well made. Doesn't quite fit the Jeep. Not sure how the lock is supposed to work. (no instructions included)
4,"Great Price, Great Cover",Exactly what I was looking for - shaped to fit my Jeep just right. I thought it was going to be a little thicker but it's just fine as it is. Shipped timely and in one simple box. Thanks bunches!
2,Awful Compilation,"This is more of a soft guide to salsa de New York! How on earth can you have Yomo Toro and Plena Libre representing Puerto Rican salsa? And aren't Tito Puente, Jimmy Bosch and Eddie Palmieri New Yorker's? Let's not forget that Jose ""El Canario"" Alberto is DOMINICAN! You cannot make any rough guide to salsa de Puerto Rico compilation without the maestro's themselves! Namely ""La Sonora Poncena"", ""Cheo Feliciano"", ""Ismael Rivera"", ""Pete (el conde) Rodriguez"", ""Andy Montanez"", ""Hector Lavoe"", ""Ray Barretto"", ""Ismael Miranda"", ""Willie Rosario"", and ""El Gran Combo"". All of which are MISSING from this weak compilation (with the exception of Hector Lavoe)!"
3,Flimsy,"These were the exactly what I was looking for, but not as sturdy as the same size item at Lowe's. I wanted them to hold clothing for my children (ages 4 and 6), but they were not strong enough to hold even a stack of t-shirts or leggings."
4,Great Storage Option,"I would give it 5 stars if the drawers had a window in the front - it would make this design much more user friendly. But I love these drawers, they are great for keeping dust off of clothes and other items."
3,Not What You're Thinking,"First, the good news: this HEPA Filter fits the Electrolux Harmony EL6985.Now, the bad news: this filter is NOT made by Electrolux! Surprised? I was. I thought I was ordering an Electrolux Filter that would replace the one in my vacuum. Instead, I wound up with a filter made by EnviroCare Technologies. I'm sure it's a very good filter, but NOWHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION DOES IT SAY THAT IT'S MADE BY ENVIROCARE!!!I took off 2 stars for being sneaky, and I probably should have taken off all 5.Next time, I'm ordering this one:[...]At least the picture says ""Electrolux.""Amazon, I am disappointed with you for allowing such chicanery."
1,Agree with the previous reviewer about not fitting my Harmony,I totally agree with the previous reviewer about this not fitting our vacuum. What a waste of time and money.
1,not the correct product,"This doesn't actually fit in my Electrolux Harmony vacuum cleaner, although the box label says that it will. Really frustrating to have to deal with returning it."
3,"Fits, but who knows how well it works","I've ordered this product twice before. Each time it fit fine. I have a Harmony.It gets dirty, but who knows how well it's really filtering or how much the bag choice affects its usefulness."
3,Squire Throwleigh's Heir,"A good mystery, although it did tend to get bogged down at times. Not as intriguing as the previous mysteries in the series but enjoyable nontheless. Part of the problem I suspect is that few of the characters are likeable; it is especially difficult to feel any real empathy for Lady Katherine, who looses both her husband and son in a matter of days. However the book is rich in detail and atmosphere, and is, as I had already noted a rather good mystery."
2,Disappointing,I didn't like it. It is very poorly written and has many grammatical errors. It reads like a children's book. For these reasons I find it difficult to trust the information contained in it. Very disappointed.
3,Poor quality,"I bought this headphone 3 months ago, and I not often wear it. However,the connection over head is broken and I need to return it to the factory for repairing.In addition, the performance of sound is so so,not perfect,absoluted not worth it price(over $100!),There are many better choice under $100 such as AKG k26p,...The only thing I am satisfied with this product is the comfortable, it really wears comfortable, not so flexible and so tight.So I give it 3 stars"
2,Cheap,"This is a cheap product. When I received it I found the screw collar around the central spigot loose. I removed it to investigate and found a plastic clip has already broken. I haven't connected it up yet so I don't know if it will still work - I suspect not.I have just started seeking a replacement part...I would not buy this again. Instead, a metal faucet is well worth the money!"
5,Life changing adventure,"OK, I'm the author of the book. But I wanted to share with you some of the comments I have received from those who read The Grace Way. Numerous Bible study groups have tested this material for content and relevence. All of them reported how much they enjoyed studying it together. Get a group together and try to get through a chapter a week. Usually there is so much positive discussion that one week isn't enough. Read the book and do the exercises, as it is a workbook too. Email me and let me know your experience with The Grace Way."
5,Great Music,"This collection of songs from the soundtrack of the movie 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is a definite gem. The songs, in order, are 'In Dreams' [words and music by Fran Walsh and Howard Shore], 'The Prophecy' [text by J.R.R. Tolkien], 'Aniron' [words by Roma Ryan, music by Enya and Nicky Ryan] 'A lament for Gandalf' [text by Philippa Boyens], 'Many Meetings' [music by Howard Shore], and 'May it Be' [words by Roma Ryan, Music by Enya and Nicky Ryan]. Inside, there are also lots of beautiful pictures from the movie. This is a beautiful accompaniment for the soundtrack. The music is for 'piano, vocal, or chords', but other instruments could play along. I would DEFINETELY rate this 10 stars, only the limit is 5. I recommend this music for anyone who loves music, Enya, or The Lord of the Rings."
3,It's okay...,"the piano isn't very good, too simple. I liked that it had the words to sing along with."
4,Great music,"I bought this for my 12 year old who tuaght herself piano. She says ""I really liked the soundtrack music book. The songs were a little hard, but it was still really fun learning how to play them."""
4,Not very much selection,"The book is rather thin,but if you're a real lotr music fan,then you won't mind.All of The Prophecy is included which makes for an interesting experience.Many Meetings gives you Elrond's theme and a little bit of the Shire.The beautiful songs Aniron and May It Be are little more than chords which is still better than nothing.In Dreams is satisfying due to its accuracy and is hard enough to make it pretty.Lament For Gandalf is really useless.It's just the same two unapealing music phrases for about 5 minutes.I was rather disappointed with the lack of music from the movie such as Concerning Hobbits,The Bridge of Kazad Dum,and The Breaking of the Fellowship which they should have included.But I have to give it 4 stars just because I love the soundtrack and anything from it is worth getting."
5,COCINA PRACTICA,"Para todas las amas de casa que siempre tienen diversas ocupaciones, este es el libro ideal para cocinar rico, rápido y práctico....Saborea de estas deliciosas recetas."
4,it is a ball; it is a blast,"i'm apparently a big fan of yazbek. LOVED the full monty and since i happen to also love the film dirty rotton scoundrels, i bought this track immediately. i wish i could see the stage version, but there are no theatres anywhere near me and it's terribly lucky that i'm able to see as many plays as i do. anyhow, this track is fantastic and so true to the film, although i will have to insist that the full monty is better. all in all, i can't wait for yazbek to come out with something else-his music is so much fun and whether monty was better or not, they're both brilliant. lyrics take the cake, melodies are simple and witty, voices are-of course-gorgeous. my only wish is that there had been more collective singing as opposed to solo after solo, just because i found that to be one of the most captivating aspects of the full monty. oh, and even though the last number, it was a ball, is terrific, i'm afraid it borrows from the overture of monty. hehehehe. oh...i love it. yeah."
4,Witty and tuneful.,"Even if the show didn't quite gel on stage, this snappy recording proves that Yazbek is no one-off wonder. Although he sometimes defaults to the thump-thump-thump that characterized The Full Monty, this score has more wit and more melody, and the recording provides a good rendition of the hilarious plot.I've never quite accepted John Lithgow as a musical comedy star, but he seems more relaxed here, and he delivers his second-act ballad superbly. My only complaint? Not enough photos of Sherie Rene Scott."
5,Simply Amazing!,I saw the play last month and I was amazed at how funny and witty it was! So I got the soundtrack after I left the theatre and I havent stopped listening to it since! I hear the songs and I can still imagine them on stage performing the show! Even if you havent seen the play the soundtrack is still good to listen to ...Although dont go any further then track 16 if you havent seen the play...well John Lithgow will let you know all about that at track 17! Buy this cd you won't be let down!
4,"Fun,and enjoyable",This CD has music that can be very fun and enjoyable to listen to.The score has a bit of a jazzy sound to it.the music is not pretty nor is the singing pretty but it is not supossed to be.This is a CD album for those Musical fan's that are stick and tired of stuff like Hairspary and some of the other corny Musical's out there.
5,Awesome!!!!,i haven't received this CD yet but i know anything with John Lithgow in it is great. and not just great but awesome
4,"Fun score, risque and not for kids","I Chose 4 stars because although most of the music is fun, there is some repetition, and much of the comedy written in the lyrics is ""I can't believe they said"" that rather than real fun. The actors make it fun, but it's not built into the score."
5,I Like Dis,"I must say that I was a little excited about this soundtrack, even before it came out. I have what one could call a minor obsession with Norbert Leo Butz's voice and he did not let me down on the cd. The entire CD just brings back the wonderful memories of seeing the show. If you haven't seen it I recommend going before the original cast is gone, but if you don't want to see it you will still enjoy the music. Its funny, light hearted, and upbeat. Some of the stuff just makes you want to dance, while others you find soothing until you start laughing at the lyrics. It's just wonderfully done."
4,Brilliant and hysterical!,"I went to see the show last week and even though I sadly did not get to see Norbert as Freddy his understudy was marvelous and felt I hadn't lost much if anything with his absence.I immediatly went and bought the CD and love it, witty, funny and sweet it really captures what I saw on stage.Johanna Gleason is my favorite but Greg Jbara is also wonderful and nothing can compare to the hilarity of ""Great Big Stuff""! There are some minor differences to what I saw on stage but for the most part this is the same stuff you'll hear on Broadway.And it's worth every penny..even if you have to trick some innocent person into buying it for you! *wink*"
5,Good old dirty rotten fun,"At first, I borrowed this from the library because I love Norbert Leo Butz. He was very good in Wicked, but the part of Freddy Benson seems made for him. I can't wait to see the show; the entire cast is amazing. Some of my favorite tracks:-Great Big Stuff-All About Ruprecht-Here I Am-Ruffhousin' mit Shuffhausen-The More We Dance-Love is my Legs-Dirty Rotten NumberAll three of the leads are completely at ease in their parts, even though John Lithgow and Sherie Rene Scott have since moved on. If you like good old-fashioned comedy, this is a show for you!"
5,musical,Love it love it love it! The musical is fantastic (saw it twice) but this is the next best thing! Love that it has the words so I can sing along.
2,Unfulfilled,"I picked up this book for the reason that Robert Silverberg wrote it. I was curious what he would have to say about the afterlife, and the obvious implications of a way back. If anyone could create a believable journey it would be him. What I found inside this tattered cover was a hollow incomprehensible story that jumps about like a rabbit on a griddle. The namesake of the book is addressed once early on in the book, and again towards the middle. Sixty pages to the end finally is the subject attended to in any serious fashion. Although Silverberg does eventually bring you to what he has promised it seems rushed, and forced. When the book was over I was left feeling hollow, and my time wasted. If you would like to read about book by Robert Silverberg, do not make it this one. Make it something Sci-Fi, not this historical melting pot of scattered thoughts."
5,wilton 50th anniversary pick,"this is a very beautiful cake topper! with sparkly stones on it will catch the light and sparkle so pretty at our anniversary party coming up, we love it!"
5,Great Experience ordering The Wilton Anniversary Pick,The 50th Anniversary pick was an attractive cake topper. It had just enough bling to make it sparkle without being heavy and old fashion. It was shipped quickly and was received in pristine condition.
3,Not Silver...,"It says in the description that this is ""Gold"" but I was just looking at the picture which definitely looks silver. I was a little surprised to find a gold one when I opened it. The pick looks a little cheap but I guess that's what you get for 15$. It's plastic and I was expecting metal."
2,The Dregs,"It's old stuff, pulled from the bins, but if you like the blues (and I do), you'll probably enjoy it. The downers are that there's not much ""Clapton"" to this and the recording quality isn't always top notch."
2,this helmet is HUGE.,I checked out the Bell website for sizing instructions and I find this helmet is HUGE. Way too big. It doesn't fit very well (too loose) and it's just ridiculously large sitting on the head.
1,Neither quality nor a color satisfies expectation.,"Because I could purchase it for low price than bought it in Japan, I decided purchase it at this site.However, quality does not reach the level that I can be satisfied with.At first it was not clean molding of a shell and am rickety.(There is not a problem on practical use)In addition, a color is slightly purple blue instead of bright blue such as a photograph.What I do not return goods to is because I do not like that return charges are necessary.I am not satisfied with this article."
5,Life Saver,"I will be purchasing a new Influx due to the fact that my current helmet was damaged during a fall. I began riding several hours after a rain and although the streets were dry, wet leaves were lurking on the side of the street ready for me to make a turn in their midst. My bike slipped and I had no time to cushion the fall. I was shocked by the force of the impact of my helmet hitting the pavement. I am grateful that I was wearing the Bell Influx because the helmet protected my head from the street. The helmet's inner foam is cracked, but it did it's job of protecting me from a certain cracked skull."
5,Quality Helmet,"This helmet fits well and remains in place on my head. If you have a slighly larger than normal head this is the helmet for you. Additionally, the many holes through out allow you to stay cool while riding in the heat."
5,"Great value, comfortable, fits well","I view bike helmets as one of those ""price of entry"" purchases: you need one if you're going to ride, you don't want it to be too ugly, and you hope it does its job if it ever needs to. Beyond that, there aren't a ton of extra bells and whistles worth talking about.That said, this helmet is a solid value. It's comfortable, decently ventilated, has a number of reasonably attractive color options and is easy to adjust, put on and take off. How much more can you ask of a budget bike helmet?"
5,Cool helmet,"I bought two of these helmets for my teenage sons. The 13 year old thinks it's cool looking so that was good. There are plenty of adjustment straps and sponge inserts for fit so that wasn't a problem.They are good to look at, easy to fit, and comfortable for riding."
5,bike helmet,I had same helmet save my neck in an accident. It's mountain bike helmet but I use it road biking for more protection. It fits well with nice fine tuning.
4,buy it!!,"i dont know what is the difference bet. this helmet and a $100+ helmet, this is stylish & will protect you, so better dont waste your money on an expensive helmet it will not make you fast, i rate this 4 because style-wise there are more better looking helmet out there.....for around $100"

5,"Delicious, but be careful!","These peanut butter cups are absolutely delicious. After these, Reese's just don't have any appeal. They are mostly organic and make for a delightful treat. But be careful, they are very addictive and quite fattening!"
5,What a great book!,"We bought both of Sandra's books about a month ago to read to our 5 year old daughter, Hannah. It didn't take long for Hannah to get hooked and make a connection with ""Maggie"". She loves for me to read a few pages every night before she goes to bed, and begs me to keep going when I tell her it's time for ""lights out"". It's an A+ book, and the spiritual benefits are already showing up!"
2,A big disappointment for a natural redhead,"The book was a disappointment for me. I am a natural redhead, and I thought that the list of famous redheads would be -- natural redheads --. Anyone can buy a box of haircolor and become ""red"". An example? Wynnona & Naomi Judd...both natural brunettes! The funniest example is in the chapter ""Political Figures"".....I did not know that Malcolm X was a redhead! In all fairness, there are some very interesting facts, stories, superstitions and folklore. Those things were interesting. But, being born a redhead, and still having red hair after 33 years, I must say that it is almost insulting to see names listed who definitely dye to get their look. And I've never seen anyone with dyed red hair that it looks natural! Science can't duplicate what nature perfected!"
3,Cute,"Cute for random facts about redheads and famous redheads. It's really more of a curiosity book for fun, nothing really educational."
2,"Out of Date, Boring...Unauthorized","Instead of wasting my money I rented this from Netflix (probably shouldn't even have done that). The interview is very very old, Jon hardly smiles at all... in fact he seems totally disinterested to be there. Not worth it... wait for something the band puts out."
1,Why buy something UNauthorized?,"I don't know why any Bon Jovi fan would spend money on unauthorized material. Someone is trying to make money off of Bon Jovi's name, without their blessing. That's ugly. I've been a Bon Jovi fan from the start. I haven't seen this, but from those who have, I gather it's pretty much weak and has nothing to offer. It figures.No thanks. I'll pass on this...and any other UNauthorized material."
2,Disappointing,I bought this and 5 vehicles for my 3-yr-old. I was frustrated and disappointed with the quality of the flimsy cheap track and the way the track fits together. It just seems cheap (the track) and getting the track to store as it should underneath the lid is something a younger child will NOT master. (I even have to play around with the track a bit to get it to work so the lid/roof shuts!) Booo! Stick to the real stuff.
3,My kids love it - I don't,"My boys love all things Thomas, so in their case this is a great toy. My major complaint is the fact that it is not so easy to ""take along"". The track storage compartment at the top is not very big and if you don't fit the tracks in perfectly, the lid just doesn't close. Not a very convenient take along toy and the tracks are always scattered about the house. I agree with other reviewers - the wooden tracks are much better - I would rather take enough of those along to make a simple track than this toy."
1,Piece of Crap,"Stay with the wooden trains, this set is crap. The trains get stuck in the little doors all the time, as well as toddler hands on occasion (seriously). The catches on the doors wear out quickly so they won't close (which is frustrating to little engineers). The tracks take more coordination to assemble than little hands can muster. I hate this toy, but the trains themselves are nice. All and all the wooden Thomas trains are much better. They are easier for little hands to control and the tracks can be assembled in different ways to keep the toy fresh."
4,Nice for the price,"We have purchased over the years both the brio wooden thomas sets and now the take along sets. I must admit, my husband and I differ in opinion about them. I always leaned toward the brio and he the take along. I have to say, the price of the brio sets have been steadily climbing over the years and I just can't/won't justify the added expense (and it is a big difference by the way) of the brio sets when my boys (4 and 18 months) love the take alongs every bit as much as the expensive ones! My son loves to take the roundhouse along and I love that there is a place for all the trains. I also think some of the negative reviews are a bit unfair. We've saved a bundle with these sets and my kids love them. Thats good enough for me!"
2,Not worth the trouble,"My kids got this for Christmas 2 weeks ago and we are already giving it away to charity. It is very cheap feeling and the doors or almost impossible for me to open. The storage for the tracks is not large enough unless you put them in JUST right. We also have another of these playsets and it is the same, just not enough fun for the trouble or cheapness. Now, I DO like the take along trains and tracks. My kids just don't need to add the badly made playsets to the tracks to have fun. I'd take a pass if I were you."
2,Frustrating and painful for little fingers,"Cute in concept, but the easiest way for kids to get the doors open is to stick their fingers in the holes of the windows and pull the door open. This had led to more tears at our house than the toy is worth. The pull out part that the track is attached to comes detached from the building fairly easily. I like how the roof opens to hold all the tracks that come with this set (although if you were to buy additional tracks there is no additional space to store them in this particular building)."
4,Fever Fever 4/5,"This one takes a few listens to really catch on (just like most of their albums). And just like most of their albums you will have your favorite songs and songs that you'll continuously skip. You've heard these songs before, but now they are being played by Puffy. That is the only difference. I personally loved their album ""Nice"" the most because of the production value. Most of their others have been pretty raw like this one. But if you love Puffy and you can't get enough... this should take care of you for a while."
1,Do not buy! waste of money and time,I bought the whole set after watching some videos online...wow I was very disappointed I ended up returning the product as the color I received was not natural and did not go on as even as I thought...I would not waste my money or time again!
4,Great tanner,"After trying numerous selftanners, I bought this one. Just the giga mega bottle as I wanna be brown all year round.I have light olive skin. This lotion gave me deep dark brown color.My friends and collegues were telling my how nice i look. That i'm glowing and looking very fresh.I givr this product only 4 stars, cos it is not aa easy to apply as foam. And it does not seem to fade as eaveny as tan from foam.Bug i absolutely love the smell of it. It is somewhere between almond/cherry/vanilla.And it dries so quick and skin is so soft after applaying it.I deffinately recomend this product."
3,Doesn't blend well. Color uneven.,"I must state first that i am NOT a newbee to self tanning - but rather have spent the past 10 or so years frantically trying all the products available in my quest for the best product. And, this is NOT it.Its good that it has a dark guide color, but its really hard to blend well. Its a cream, but its weirdly sticky not smooth so its hard to get on. The result: takes around 6 hours like other tanners but the color wasn't deep at all - it was barely any color there.Still have full bottle (used only twice to give it a fair chance) and probably will throw away.Fake Bake is WAAAY better than this product."
3,Tanner,"If you are really light skinned, don't buy this in very dark. The regular dark shade works the best= )"
4,LOVE,I just got my first bottle of sun labs and first off i would like to give a round of applause to amazon for shipping so quickly! I ordered on monday and was expected to get it between april 2nd and april 16 but I got it 3 days later. I used it tonight as well for the first time. I exfoliated very well and put it on basically right after the shower. I love the color gaurd instant tint because i know exactly where i'm putting it. The only thing that is worrying me is it's a bit streaky. but i was wearing oversized plastic gloves so i think that may be the problem. I plan on getting a tanning mitt for this and I will love it! no smell at all! LOVE!
2,Not a $30 product,"I got the Dark Sensation version which, according to the manufacturer, would give my natural olive skin color a much darker shade....not really. This product may work for someone super white, but not for me. It smells like any other sunless tan lotion, and it has been the most difficult one to remove from my hands after application. I think I am better off with the Victorias secret one for $12 I was using. It gives me a much darker color, and it is easier to remove form my hands."
2,Fun early star wars game,"i found this game in a ""games from the past"" section at my eb games .. a rare find indeed :) i have the sega cd version and i have to say its not bad..it plays a lot like its sequel rebel assult 2.. they have early full motion video clips from the films in the intro. which has a nice retro touch...all things said its a fun game..graphically not as hot as the rebel assult 2 but still worth checking out .. and one of the few rare games for the sega genesis/sega cd systems..if your lucky to find this grab it !"
1,MoreQualityLessMoney - NOT GENUINE Electrolux Part,"E-mailed the following to Amazon - Electrolux HEPA H12 Washable EL012W Vacuum Cleaner Replacement Filter by Electrolux - MoreQualityLessMoney and other sellers are using Amazon to pass off third-party manufactured products as genuine Electrolux products (even going so far as having the orders Fulfilled by Amazon, in this seller's case), and from the reviews it sounds like Amazon customers are getting PO'd. The title says ""by Electrolux"" implying the item was manufactured by Electrolux, and the product description is lifted off the Electrolux web-site word for word. The title and description also identifies the Electrolux part number and no where does it say or imply that the item is a non-Electrolux ""equivalent"" made by another company. In addition, it's not even an equivalent item as the listing is for a washable HEPA filter and what gets sent is a one-use HEPA Filter. Please clean up this part of your web-site. Thanks"
1,Does not fit Oxygen 3 and is not washable,"Unlike written in the product description, this filter does not fit the Electrolux Oxygen3 and is not washable. It looks different from what is on the picture and is not made by Electrolux."
1,Don't buy from VacuumSupplyStore,"This vendor sent the wrong item. I complained, they provided a partial refund. I complained again, received the full refund.Yes, this is rating the vendor and not the product but hopefully it'll save others the time to review the vendor's feedback."
1,Electrolux EL12W Washable Filter,"I requested an EL012W washable filter for the Electrolux Oxygen3 vacumm cleaner. So far, I've been sent the EL013W which doesn't fit the Oxygen3 and the EL012 which is not the washable version.My initial e-mail was promptly followed by the vendor sending me the EL012 (non-washable filter), but they have not responded to my latest e-mail telling them the order was still wrong now over a month later."
1,Makes a great doorstop,This lasted until the warranty ran out then the battery died. To add insult to injury the outlets powered by the battery no longer work.
2,It works... sort of...,"I purchased about a dozen of these for the office I work in. The UPS itself works fine. The software crashed about half of the pc's that I installed it on. The pc would be in a constant reset after crashing near the end of the install. Since the install never finished it never registered correctly and it would not show up in my Add/Remove Program list. I had to delete ever entry of the registery to get it to unistall. For my needs the software was more important than the actual UPS. Since the software lets you know the condition of the battery and allows you to configure the UPS to shut the pc down automatically on power loss.If you want a creap UPS and don;t care about the software, this may be what you need. As for me, I would not buy this UPS again."
1,did not work,The Cyberpower CPS425SL was dead when we tried to install it. We ordered it as a backup for our elevator.
2,Didn't work very long,Noticed in the last storm the battery backup wasn't working..Thought I had a bad unit until I started Google and everybody has issues..I have a tripp lite for my home theater room and it runs the whole system and does power cleanup..Getting another tripp lite or APC tomorrow.
1,I should not have bought this UPS,"Like others reviews. It works fine at first, after 1 year this unit does not provide any backup function at all. I only have a PC and 19inch monitor plug into this cyberpower UPS. As soon as the electric power out, or ""brown-out"", just barely one millisecond ""brown-out"" glitch, my computer was turned off and won't powerback on again.I have the 2 other APC UPS and they are older than the cyber power and they work perfectly on my other computers."
1,Garbage,I bought 8 of the 425VA units for my office computers. All of them have died within about a year. I went with Cyber Power because it was cheaper than APC or Tripp Lite. Should have stuck with the better brands.
2,is it mono or stereo ?,this album is listed as 1965 and appears to be in mono not stereo.there is no indication of mono in the product description
1,Not the British Miniseries,"Beware. This is NOT the award-winning British miniseries of the same name, despite Amazon listing it as such and Amazon sellors claiming it is. Do not buy this if you are attempting to purchase the miniseries."
4,"Cute, sexy, and down--right loveable!","This book was wonderful! It was the combination of the characters and how they dealt with each other, and the SEXY hero, being impatient for the heroine that intrigued me. The way they managed to get together despite of what her father said. This book is a re-read without a doubt!"
4,Fascinating Topic but Frustrating Interludes,"I have to concur with other reviewers - I found Campbell's lecture very interesting, but the interludes by Susan Sarandon were just plain annoying.Campbell's lecture was unscripted and ""off the cuff"", but years of oration shows in a compelling delivery. Susan's sounded liked she was reading a children's book to the viewer.Perhaps the producers thought they needed to ""dumb-down"" the content while featuring some celebrity talent to help sell the video.Nothing against Susan Sarandon, people! A lovely lady and a fine actress. But her inclusion in this video seemed awkward and unnecessary to me."
4,Mythos II,"I love Joseph Campbell. I didn't give this DVD 5 stars mainly because I found the constant intrusion by Susan Sarandon to be extremely annoying. I'm assuming it's the script she is reading, but she comes across as very condescending. It would be a much much better video without her."
4,Joseph Campbell Mythos II,"El producto es muy bueno, tiene mucho material bueno aunque debería tener subtitulos en español (el ingles es algo rápido y aveces no se entiendo mucho."
1,Just the same as every other scam out there...,Just because Lesko appears on TV and has not been raided by the marines and shut down (yet) does not mean almost all the information in his books and tapes is not total garbage. The people on the TV advertisements were actors. If you send swarms of mail to strange places begging for grants you may get in trouble your self. Advice....stay clear of this trap turn Lesko in to whomever you can.
1,FREE MONEY TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE: WHAT BULL!!,"THIS BOOK IS FULL OF $%#*, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! I'VE CALLED MANY OF THE NUMBERS AND THEY NO LONGER EXIST. THIS BOOK IS A FRAUD AND A WAST OF TIME.""""I HATE THIS BOOK"""
3,OK,Informative book. But there are not any useful resources for California residents that are above the poverty line.
1,...,"Apparently it's not possible to get government assistance unless you're so dull-witted you need Mr.Lesko's help and since he gets [something] per book, having sold over nine thousand copies should set ""him"" free of any cash-flow problems...uh-huh.I think this book targets people who desperately need help and are willing to use their last dime to ""hopefully"" find a better way. It's pretty ""vulturistic"" to coin a word - been there/done that...wish I had the money now!"
2,An Expensive Phonebook!!!,"Most of the stuff Mr. Lesko talks about is available. You can get grants for your home, you can get loans for business, you can get different loans for school. The problem with this book is Mr. Lesko makes it sound like it's top secret stuff and the money is just sent to you in the mail. His marketing gimmicks are highly questionable. The book does have real goverment programs listed. You can find any of this information by checking out the Small Business Admin. web site. All he has done is taken little & well known programs (like HUD,SBA,etc..) and compiled them into one book. If your curious about the money he's talking about, check the book out from the library and look the stuff up online or call your neighborhood small business association or the goverments Housing and Urban Developement program. Save yourself 30+ dollars, Dont buy it."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"The best way to check all of Lesko's books is through the library, which is what I did. It became evident that information listed in his books is available through government and state agencies for FREE!!!! Also note, there is no such thing as FREE when it comes to so-called government giveaways. There is always a catch....."
2,Free Money to Change Your Life,"After reviewing this product, I have decided that it is not what I need. I am going to hold on to this book for other usage, but it did not provide the information needed for me."
1,Free BS,This book is a bunch of BS. The only thing good about it is the commercial and the Matthew Lesko's energy level put into the promotion of the book in order to make money from the book sales.
1,Worth to see other resrouces,"Hi, I defenitely don't recommend this book. It's just a book of grant links that will waste you time and money. I personally recommend one site called free government grants at http://freegovernmentgrants.wordpress.com which I personally can recommend it to anybody. I bought the resource for only [...] dlls, nut I think they reduced it to just [...] usd, which for me is a bargain :) and considering that I got [...] dlls recently from the government, it got paid by itself 1000 times more :)Please check it out [...]"
1,What A Joke!,"If you are a one-eyed one-legged Black woman living in public housing in Alabama and your grandmother is part Cherokee, this book is for you. Otherwise forget it.. You will get more money holding up a liquor store than you will by reading this book... A lot of hype and no pay off.."
1,Free Money to Change Your Life,"I purchased this book due to the radio commercial that promised to provide a way to ""get $15,000.00 to write a book"". This was an absolute deception. The only organizations that subsidize books in Mr. Lesko's manual are those supporting technical journals or the National Endowment for the Arts, which offered me little hope of receiving any assistance.It is outrageous that Mr. Lesko can perpetrate such a fraud on the public as this book."
1,You have a better chance winning the lottery!,"I gave this book a little crdibility because I saw this guy on Oprah. DON'T! I bought this book thinking I would have a good chance on receiving money for college or starting my own business. Boy was I wrong! You have a better chance winning the lottery than qualifying for this free money. When ever someone tells me they are going to buy this book I tell them, if you have three arms, one purple eye and live in a space ship, you have a chance to this FREE MONEY. The qualifications, I think are unrealistic. Don't waste your money."
1,The star scale should start at 0 for this one.,"Fortunately I didn't purchase this book. I saw it sitting on a shelf in a used book store and glanced through it. I copied down 11 websites of interest and when I tried them, they no longer existed. Anyone with common sense and a computer or phone can access any of this information. I work in the non-profit, social service industry and believe me there is NOTHING in this book that you can't find easily yourself...and I assure you that what you find will be up to date and accurate as opposed to the information in this book. Save yourself money and aggravation and don't purchase this farce."
2,"For information, maybe- if money is your objective, NO!","The title of this book is grossly misleading; this book does not help you obtain money, riches or wealth in any other form other than information; so if you want a source book on where to go in your state for information on insurance, taxes, licenses, grants, etc. fine; even then, some of the 'dope' in it is outdated; if you want 'free money', this book ain't not got it for you nor for anyone else; I would not have bought it if I had first reviewed it."
1,Government Giveaways for Entrepreneurs IV,"I am convinced the only favorable reviews of Lesko's books were submitted by he himself. Yes this book and his others have a place on a library reference shelf, but the average Joe or Joanne will not find enough in the books for themselves to justify the purchase price. Stop funding the question mark wardrobe. Spend your money on almost any other book!"
1,There's no such thing as a free lunch?,"Do you people honestly believe that the government is going to give you free money to start a for-profit business? All this book contains is NON-PROFIT grant information and government LOAN guarantee programs. If you don't believe me, at least go to your local library first and hire this book before you buy it!"
1,This book STINKS! =P,"This book was absolutely NO HELP at all. It's mainly about getting grants from the government and you have to be within a certain income bracket to do so. If you're middle class, FORGET IT! :("
1,Save your money - same stuff FREE at this web site,"Let me save you some money right now. You can access the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance for Free at http://12.46.245.173/cfda/cfda.htmlThis listing is a lot more up-to-date, and the full version is nearly 2000 pages long. Gee, I guess the government has enough ""free money"" to publish its own book."
1,Free Money? Not This Time,The only one receiving money on this deal is Matthew Lesko. I would strongly urge readers to look in other places if they are in search of free money. The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow would be easier to obtain.
2,Save your money!,"This book is grossly overrated and over priced. It did not have the information that I was seeking. If you are an average Joe this book will not apply you. The strategies in this book for obtaining grants etc. are for very specific people, in very specific categories, and even in specific regions. Chances are that you, like myself will not qualify for any of these programs. Save your money!"
4,"Very helpful, although slightly overpriced","Lesko sure knows how to project enthusiasm!...Turns out, there really are a lot of government agencies out there specially designed to help the small guy. A week after getting the book, I have my own freelancing business, bidding on government contracts. A guy in my neighborhood made $50,000 last year selling home-made BBQ sauce to the government. All from these unknown government agencies. The title of this book is a bit misleading. It isn't ""free"" money in the sense that you don't write a letter and a check comes in the mail. You have to get out and work for some of these funds and services..."
1,Surprised,"Personally, I'm very suprised amazon carries this book. I would expect better of them than to cary trash like this. Decieving infomercial junkies like Matthew Lesko rank alongside spam mailers on my list... I'd like to know what % of people that buy the book actually get grants, I'm sure it's either 0 or very very close to it."
4,thousands of resources,"This book has literally thousands of resources for various grants, incentives, loans, apprenticeships, internships, and on and on. All of these items require research and WORK on the part of the applicant. It is not a book of magical phone numbers and addresses that you call to receive a check. That said, it is an invaluable resource for those who are seeking financial aid for any imaginable purpose, from starting a business to job training to arts programs to aid for veterans. All information contained (phone numbers, etc.) could easily be updated if necessary with a quick Google search."
3,Good book but a bit unrealistic.....You need a better book!,"As a successful grant writer I know how hard it is to get into the spirit of writing a good document. I'd highly suggest getting books that are more realistic like ""Government Funding and You"" or the ""Grant Workbook"". Both of these books walk you through realistic scenarios to get grants and they simply aren't hype books like this one!Kelli"
1,Boo! Hiss!,A terrible scam designed to provide specialized info useless to the average person. Want free money? Put the $$ this book costs in your pocket and get on with life....
4,It Delivered,"All I can say is that some of the information in this book helped me. But, like any other self-help book, you have to actually apply the information or it is completely worthless. No 5 star rating because many of the phone numbers in it are wrong, but that didn't suprise me."
2,It's update but I was Looking for something else,"Like San Pablo too, I am also looking for the fund for my MCSE, and CCNA certificate program. THis book is not too helpful on this area. Does anyone has any idea where I can get the resources for such purpose of the funding for the career certificates and development purpose? Especially for people who is in shcool and looking for a job and try to get certificates. Thanks."
5,only genuine bags for my home vacuum,"These brand name are worth every penny and then some, no dirt gets thru them, they flow well even when almost full,your vacuum never loses suction.>Marvin"
1,Not so sexy!,"The whole transaction/deliery was great, super speedy. The install was fine with no hangups. It ran great for 6 days. Then the right display port went out giving the whole screen a blue tint. Then it died. I am in the process of returning it for another one. I hear from other reviews that it either dies in a week or is solid as a rock. I am now hoping to experience the latter."
1,Do not buy this item!,"DO NOT buy this card made by XFX! I didn't even have my card for one day! As I write this, I have forced the display to work off video 2 as the primary so that I don't go blind. Video port 1 displays everything in a medium blue tint! Unreal! I have been building PC's for 11 years and have never had this type of issue! Seems like I'm not the only one that had this issue. There is another post here from someone with the same exact problem. I am truly disappointed in this product from XFX! I don't know if I will buy their brand again after this experience."
5,Very solid feel. Awesome Quality.,Ordered this for a custom application of a lightning system on my car. Haven't installed yet but it feels much nicer and sturdier than cheaper Chinese switches like those with LEDs. They are quite good. But this feels like a Zippo and the others feel like a cheap clone.I ordered from AutoAccesories4Less and they initially sent me metallic blue switch instead of the carbon one. After 3 days they answered my email and told me to keep the wrong one and then proceeded to ship me the right one with expedited speed. They are a good company that stands behind their customers. Will order from them again.
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"Instead of a rehab DVD, the DVD featured is called: GREGG COOK's URX-MT: URBAN REBOUNDING EXTREME METABOLIC TRAINING. Instead of gentle rehab exercises, it features EXTREME FAST POWER WORK-OUT. I contacted Amazon for a refund due to the product was not what I ordered but refund is not available. So they shipped me another DVD and it's another of the wrong DVD in the correct box and label. MISREPRESENTATION? FALSE ADVERTISING? SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT. DONT ORDER THIS. SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION."
1,Not at all what it leads you to believe it is,"This Rehab Your Body at Home was recommended by our family doctor to help rehab my husband's back (herniated disk) and my knees. The description on the case says the workout is gentle, slow motion, static contraction techniques, non-jarring, no weights, no machines, other things that one thinks of when rehabbing.45 minutes into the video, they have not once warmed up and do nothing but intense cardiac workout on mini trampolines (USING WEIGHTS) to nothing but rhythmic brain-seizure inducing music.I have been gypped and am very angry that it was sold as a rehab type video when it isn't. Isn't that false advertising?????If you want an intense cardiac workout, probably great. If you want it for a rehab, don't waste your money!"
1,Distorted beyond validity,This book is most certainly among the most distorted works that purport to be an unbiased discourse on gender issues. Allan Johnson has contrived page after page of anti-men rhetoric that renders the book a pure work of fiction. How can someone be so self-hating? It is beyond me. Johnson needs to take a huge step back and realize that not everything male is horrible and that not everything female if benevolent and good. How about a BALANCED work on gender issues? I suspect that won't be coming anytime soon from Allan Johnson.
1,Much too biased,"I read this book and found it to be a most slanted discourse on gender issues. The author clearly has issues of self-loathing. To place all the ills of non-white, non-males on the backs of white males is very simplistic and disingenuous. The author's reasonings give everyone an easy out for their lot in life. If you're not as successful as you feel you're entitled to be, just blame it on men. To be so anti-men is to render the author's points little more than ad hominem attacks on the male species. The use of statistics in such a flippant way is a textbook case of how statistics can be abused. At some point, a balanced account of gender issues will arrive. Obviously that time is not now."
5,Helpful!,This book helped me a liitle to overcome my fears of the deep end of my pool. It may even help you in some ways.
1,BE AWARE,"I MADE A PHONE CALL AND IT SHOWED UP AS A THREE WAY CALL ON MY PHONE BILL!!! I HAVE PROOF !!! Be very careful when using this product... you have to dial their number and then the number your calling and a three way call showed up on my Cell phone bill worth $52... I was calling Bolivia, South America !!!"
5,What a prize!,My 3 year old got this toy and loves it. The rockets do not shoot very far and do not hurt if hit by one. The arms and legs click when moved. The helmet opens and closes and when you push his buttons he has several different saying. The 3 buttons push down together so he has more than just 3 sayings. The laser light is a big plus too. My son continually plays with this toy. Would be a great buy.
5,My favorite Beatles Album...,"Even though this is my favorite Beatles album, it still contains the only Beatles song that I can't stand, 'You Won't See Me'. But the rest of the album more than makes up for that one song. Definately a must for any Beatles or Music fan."
5,First Inkling,"I remember thinking when this album first came out that it was something very different and I really liked it. The Beatles were taking their fans in a new direction. This wasn't just music to dance to, but to listen to, to absorb. As difficult as it is to pick a favorite Beatles' album this one could very easily be at the top of my list."
5,An album of Genius,"This album rates as one of if not my favorite, songs ""Drive my Car"", ""Wait"", and ""Norweigan Wood"", are good but ""In My Life"" stands out in my mind as an anthem of soul and pain, I could listen to it over and over."
5,Great Quality!,It's cool to hear this music remasterd and on vinyl! It feels like it takes me back to the days they were still together :)
2,The Most Overrated Beatles Album...,"This album was a rushed recording project and it shows. During 1965 at the height of Beatlemania, the guys were rushed into the studio at the end of the year after a successful tour and hit film. They had absolutely no time to do any recording so basically everything was pulled from where the sun doesn't shine. There are a few tracks that stand out such as ""I'm Looking Through You"" and ""If I Needed Someone"" but all in all these songs might as well have been put on the Please Please Me album (which the song ""Wait"" was a song written during that time). The only really cool thing about this album is the effected photograph used as the front cover. Other than that, I really don't see what is so pivitol about this album."
2,Rubber Soul,"""...a starting point for music.."", ""...one flawless package..."" What Goes On? Run For Your Life? If you like a few tracks then fine, but get real people."
2,Easy Listening,"Michelle, You Won't See Me....Rubber Soul, the Beatle album for the Barry Manilow and Barbra Streisand crowd."
3,Conspicuous in ist Absence,"Of course it's great, it's the Beatles after all. However, why is ""I've Just Seen a Face"" missing, (from side 1, song 1)? Definitely one of the best tunes on the album. Why fool around with the original classic? Very disappointing."
1,"Great Album. 5 stars, heck 10 stars, SO WHY CHANGE IT?!!?!!","All I ask is a release of the ORIGINAL on CD. The same 12 tracks in the same order. It was perfection at the time, so why mess with it?????? Why can't the company simply re-release the original without, ""bonus"" tracks, especially without replacing original tracks like putting ""Drive My Car"" where ""I've Just Seen a Face"" should be and without ""What Goes On"" where ""It's Only Love"" should be. I can live with ""Nowhere Man"" being inserted out of nowhere and ""If I Needed Someone"" is a grea song, but why ut them in the middle of the old line-up? Put them at them end. The Beatles were one of the first bands to make albums that were unified wholes and Rubber Soul was one of the first albums that began to show this quality. Please, please, someone release the CD the way it was meant to be. Actually, never mind. My 1965 LP is in great shape ... I'll rip it, save the money, scan the artwork and sell it the damn CD."
1,"If it was really Rubber Soul, I'd give it a 5","I saw this album on sale on CD Now recently and purchased it to help round out my Beatles collection. What a disappointment ! It bears little resemblance the the album of the same name released in the U.S. in 1965. In this ""import"" version, the original first song, ""I've Just Seen a Face,"" is completely missing. What a bummer, since it set the tone for a great album. Unless you can find the original, don't buy this for posterity. There are some good songs, but it's not the album I grew up with. Sad !"
2,Rubber Soul - OK,"There are 5 songs out of 14 here that are really good - Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man, In My Life, and If I Needed Someone. John wrote 3, George wrote one and the other is a Lennon/McCartney collaboration. The rest of the CD is only adequate, as songs like Run for Your Life and What Goes On are just below par, and Michelle and You Won't See Me are easy listening songs.I prefer the albums pre-Rubber Soul.5 songs out of 14 is worth 1.8 stars."
2,Beatles First Art Album is Right,"With all the great music released in the 60s, 70s and 80s, I feel sorry for anyone who still has Rubber Soul in a prominant place in their listening queue. While many bands have written songs with great riffs along the lines of Taxman, Day Tripper, and Paperback Writer, the fact is that the vast majority of Beatle tracks from '65-'67 were light pop. Amazing how little some people actually know about this band.Rubber Soul has a few redeeming tracks like Norwegian Wood and In My Life (also acoustic pop) that can be had on greatest hits compilations, with which you can hear these songs without suffering through the likes of Michelle. 2 stars."
4,Awesome.... but very dissapointed!,It's the Beatles so it is GREAT! But...I guess I missed in the description or it wasn't there that this is NOT the same as the album I loved as a pre-teen. It must be the world or british release as it is missing songs and has songs that my lp does not.This is fine but to evoke the memories of long ago the order of songs and familiarity from hundreds on listenings as a youngster is missing.I actuall prefer to play the old lp and I am not someone who prefers crackles and pops in my music.I guess I'm not really happy with it.
2,Disappointing Remaster,"Obviously Rubber Soul is an extremely good album. Unfortunately, this 2009 remastering is not. The remastering took all of the soul out of it. This is not even close to the original LP in terms of sound quality. A lot of the sound that was there on vinyl is absent, as if they took an eight track recording and cut it to two tracks. A disappointment."
4,"Yep, I'm hard to please","After a take of ""I'm Down"" featured on Anthology Vol.2 Paul laments ""plastic soul man plastic soul"". This album reflects their attitude to the music, not being rock'n'roll anymore, and not yet fully fledged Art a la ""Pepper"".The Beatles were astute enough (with George Martin's firm but gentle encouragement) to explore new musical sounds based on contemporary West Coast styles (the Byrds, Beachboys) and exotic Eastern offerings (Ravi Shankar). But this new musical foundation doesn't completely compensate for some below par songs - ""The Word"", ""What Goes On"", even ""Drive My Car"" (saved by a strong groove), weak lyrical ""sampling"" (""Run For Your Life""; see Artur Gunter's ""Baby Let's Play House"")and tired playing ""If I Needed Someone"" and ""Wait"". But its best are brilliant, opening the door to imaginative and inventive Rock structures which consigned the three minute format to strictly Top 40 pop."
2,Slight improvement,"First. . .5 stars for the original album, and 5 stars for the Beatles, of course. I bought the remasters of ""Help"" and ""Rubber Soul."" Great albums, but the lopsided stereo is annoying. The liner notes say, in very small print, they worked from the 1987 remaster. No wonder the sound improvement is only slight. Nice new booklet, however."
5,Best Beatle Album,This is the best the Beatles put out. I was in high school when this album was originally released. All of the songs except for a couple were hits.
1,WOW!!! RIP OFF!!!,tThis album is another rip off....It contains a mini documentry....That is all....I travel to Asia often...I will now buy a counterfit copy.Amazon why are you selling this rip off
5,Rubber Soul is great,"This is a really great album by The beatles...The only weak song on here is ""What Goes On""..but Nowhere man,Norwegian Wood,You Wont See me,Michelle,In My Life,Think for yourself,The Word,Girl and Im Looking Through You are masterpiecesI reccomend this for any classic rock fan GO BUY IT!!"
5,Beatles Rubber Soul,What is there to say? It's the BEATLES! I love this and all their cd's althought this one rates a little higher up the scale.
3,Remastered for computer,"I bought this, then was dismayed to read that it had ""been enhanced to play on computer"". In that sense, it is probably truth in advertising. It is compressed, loud and emphasizes midrange. This is perfect for the awful excuses for speakers that most people have connected to their computers - screechy little boxes and tuneless thumping powered bass. Much of the beauty of music is in midrange and dynamics, both of which take money and space to reproduce. I have just played the old CD, new CD and vinyl. If you have a real stereo at home, play the vinyl at home, play the new CD in your car and iPod, make the old CD a drink coaster."
3,"What the Hell is ""Drive My Car"" Doing on ""Rubber Soul""?","And more important, where the hell is ""I've Just Seen a Face""?Sacrilege!There is only one song with which Rubber Soul should start, and that's the joyous ""I've Just Seen a Face"", not the not-worthy-of-the-Beatles ""Drive My Car.""I grew up in the 60s and memorized Rubber Soul. It's just not right to pawn off another collection as ""Rubber Soul.""Maybe this was the UK version, but with all respect to the Brits, I want the record I HAD!"
5,A Pleasure for the EARS!!!,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD!! It has some of my very favorite Beatles songs on it. ""Drive My Car"" is close to being my favorite Beatles song ever. All the songs belong on the album, there isnt one that isnt a great song!! I also love the song ""In My Life"" it is a poigniant song considering it mirrors the feelings that everyone feels about John Lennon's murder. I cannot say enough about this album, it just showed everyone who thought back then that the Beatles were NOT just some passing fad....but they were the turning point of music...they changed music forever.....and Rubber Soul helped them to do that!! I know Iconsider myself lucky to listen to such GREAT music!!!!!"
5,"they didn't even put ""the beatles"" on the cover...","They didn't even put ""the Beatles"" on the cover... that cocky or that sure? Well after you listen you realize ""that sure"". A wonderful piece of work, really gone were the ""mop-topped lapel-less jacketed popsters"", and in their place...John, Paul, George and Ringo. A very personal album, an album responding to the Dylan/Byrd craze, an album responding to the world around them, an album of transition...and what beautiful transition. Just listen to ""In My Life"", that's all you need to hear to decide Rubber Soul's brilliance."
5,Just Great....,"The Beatles are the best band of all times and their music will go on for many more generations, after we are long gone. Rubber soul is a land mark in music history and it brought so much joy to me and still does. When i listen to it's songs, it still sounds fresh like if i still heard it for the first time. Many bands have come and gone but The Beatles and Rubber Soul will be around for a long time. Thanks to John-Paul-George and Ringo for their great music and joy they bring us."
3,Release the American version.,"When Rubber Soul was originally released in the U.S. on Capitol Records, ""Drive My Car"" was missing from it. It was thought not to fit with the rest of the album, and so it was replaced. In its place came John Lennon's ""It's Only Love"" and Paul McCartney's ""I've Just Seen a Face,"" two songs which made the American version superior to the current UK import. While ""Drive My Car"" can be easily found on the '62-'66 best-of collection, ""It's Only Love"" and ""I've Just Seen a Face"" cannot be found (Yes, ""It's Only Love"" is in the Beatles Anthology, but its an alternate version of the far superior original song that appeared on the American release. If ever it should be released, I'm sure Beatles fans would love to hear the American version of ""Rubber Soul."""
5,"Rolling Stone says,the 5th greatest album ever!!!",And you know they can't be wrong... the truth will not and can not be denied!
5,LKeener,"LKeener is an 18 year old, zit faced kid from West Virginia. An avowed Beatles hater(read her profile) who has infested the web with her venom against the Fab Four. Beware of such evil!"
5,Now they were getting REALLY fab.,"Oh yes, this is when we who had discrimination realised that the lads were begining to make art."
2,Rubber Soul,"My least favorite of the Beatles major releases as they transitioned from the great rock sound of the previous albums to light pop music like Michelle and You Won't See Me. Only Drive My Car and If I Needed Someone really rock. If you like this, be sure to get Revolver too."
2,Disappointing,"They really should have spent some more time on Rubber Soul. The stereo mix is terrible on many of the tracks. Nowhere Man's vocals are too loud and the guitar is too soft. The Nowhere Man version on the 1999 Yellow Submarine album is far superior. If I Needed Someone sounds good as does a few other tracks on the 2009 SR; however, we should demand superior sound engineering for this Beatles gem."
2,Kari - U.S. Version is Different,"To the reviewer who asked about the difference in her original record vs. this CD, most of us have the U.S. Capitol Records versions of Beatle records including releases like Beatles 65, and Yesterday and Today. The CDs catalog is based on the British releases. Too bad because the U.S versions are great."
5,Duh,"Yeah, Rubber Soul's a pretty good record. Those two guys, Lennon and McCartney? It's becoming clear to me now -- they were really talented! Those Beatles sure could do a lot more than just put out perfect little three-minute dittys (hundreds of them, to be accurate)! They also could experiment with different sounds and explore lyrics beyond just ""I love you, and I hope you love me"", but have it all sound just like their previous records. Yet at the same time, have it sound totally different! That's no easy task! They sure made it look easy, didn't they? Rubber Soul has also stood the test of time! Look at its sales ranking on Amazon.com! Impressive!I'm beginning to realize that when you talk about the all-time great music of the 20th century, you really have to discuss the Beatles, and in particular this album. It really started a chain of amazing albums that ended only with the Beatles' breakup! Not bad!"
2,Unlistenable,"Now before you take me to task for the title of the review, let me say that this is not a review of the music, or the most influential band in history. Rather, it is a review of the re-mix/remaster of this amazing work. All I'm gonna say is, either mix and remaster in proper stereo, so it sounds like music (not a disjointed random hodge-podge of this here/that there), or leave the work alone. Anybody got a mono copy?Unlistenable."
3,Disappointed,The remastered stereo effect doesn't work on the these cd's originally mastered in mono. That is how they intended for them to be heard.The vocals simply sound out of place.
5,Exceptional stuff - The Beatles best album,"Kicking off with the funky Drive My Car, this album never lets up. With all songwriters firing on all cylinders, this is one of the most complete band performances of The Beatles' career. Lennon in particular shines here, the standout being In My Life, which is his musically and lyrically peak - although I didn't realise that George Martin speed up the solo until recently, which drive me crazy trying to play normally! Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man, Girl and Run For Your Life are other great Lennon tracks. George puts in two great songs with If I Needed SOmeone and Think For yourself, while Paul's Drive My Car and I'm Looking Through You are fast and fun affairs. The only problem is the mixing of the channels of Drive My Car and Run For Your Life - if you listen to them with headphones its like splitting your brain in two. But first time Beatles listeners - this is the one to get for sure!"
5,Rated #5 best ever in Rolling Stone!!,In a recent poll rolling stone says this is the 5th best rock album ever. who are we to disagree! 1 billion + sales and always topping the best album lists says it all!!!
5,"Stop whining about the ""missing"" tracks!","Nothing is missing from this album. It is presented here the way the Beatles themselves originally intended. This version is far better than the American Capitol LP and those tracks are on the Help! album. If you want the ""original"" version of Rubber Soul that badly get a CD burner and the Rubber Soul and Help! CDs and go for it. Wouldn't you rather hear it the way they intended anyway? By the way this is one of the best Beatles albums behind only Revolver and Abbey Road."
4,The Beatles at their Almost-Prime,"Rubber Soul! This Beatles album is not as good as Sgt. Pepper or even Abbey Road, but it does feature some of the best songs of all the Beatles'. The CD starts with ""Drive My Car"" which you won't like at first, but two or three weeks later your singing it to yourself. After that comes Norwegian Wood, a great beat but not so innocent lyrics. You'll also love Wait and In My Life, which are amazing songs. Like Drive My Car, you won't fall in love with Wait right away. You have to wait :-)."
5,Amazing album!,"The remastered Rubber Soul is amazing! You hear the voices and instruments so much better! The mini-documentary is also a great feature, because it includes clips of videos and the Beatles themselves talking about the album. The music is amazing, from ""Nowhere man"" to ""Wait."" Must have for any Beatles fan! The one setback, if you can call it that, is the packaging. Without the plastic case, it seems that the case will be worn in a few years. Hopefully not, but we'll see what happens."
3,"It's good, but Backstreet Boys are better","This is actually a pretty good album by the Beatles. But they have a LONG way to go before they can be respected like the Backstreet Boys, who are much better. Lennon and McCartney's songwriting can best be described as competent if cliched, but George Harrison's use of that sitar gets annoying real fast. I'd say after a couple more albums, these guys will be as good as the Backstreet Boys. But they have a LOT of work to do if they want to achieve that level of greatness."
1,Unbiased Review - Rubber Soul,"Norwegian Wood and In My Life are good songs - give John Lennon credit.The rest of this album is very forgettable, populated by You Won't See Me, Word, Michelle, Girl, Run For Your Life and the awful What Goes On.The Beatles were in transition here, as the Fab Four sound was evolving into that to be heard on Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. This album is kind of a low point. 1-star."
5,best Beatles album,"To me this is the best Beatles album, it's the only one I would give 5 stars. After Rubber Soul they started to lose it and there was too much mindless drug influence. But this one hits the spot every time I play it. There isnt a bad song on the album, Beatles at their peak. Recommended."
2,Rubber Soul,"""...Rubber Soul is the best Beatles album because it breaks new ground without straying from true rock & roll."" Especially Michelle, You Won't See Me, and that rocker What Goes On."
3,this is not the best but ok!,"the whole compositions were composed by the band members, some songs were becoming progressiv than the older scheiß-beat stuffs.but it is still not the best!The best albums are abbey road, white album, hey jude and let it be. need I say more?"
4,stupid record companies...,"the original track list of the lp goes as follows:1. I've Just Seen a Face2. Norwegian Wood3. You Won't See Me4. Think For Yourself5. The Word6. Michelle7. It's Only Love8. Girl9. I'm Looking Through You10. In My Life11. Wait12. Run For Your LifeAlthough I think ""If I Needed Someone"" is a nice addition, in general I find it disgusting that the record company felt the need to destroy what may have been the Beatles' most perfect, if not their most ground-breaking, album. Thus, 4 instead of 5 stars. Boo to Capitol!"
2,The Beatles' Rubber Soul,"This album is not so much bad as it is boring. Norwegian Wood and In My Life still sound good today, but most of the rest of the songs just sound outdated."
5,It's All Too Much,"Reviewing the Beatles is like reviewing oxygen. There will always be those idiots who prefer carbon monoxide, so let them choke. If you're listening, thanks lads. I couldn't breathe without you."
3,Just what I needed,"I needed the song ""In My Life"" This was one of the few that had it for a reasonable price. Thanks to Michael J. (I'm pretty sure) you can't purchase any of the Beatles via Napster, etc. A friend really wanted it played during his 50th birthday party slideshow. The show/party went well, the music was just what he wanted so I'm pretty happy. I ordered it one day and it was delivered the next. Too bad tho, in this day and age we still have to buy a whole CD for just one song. Thanks alot Michael. When I was five, you were my 5 year old hero so cute and talented...Look at you now...Dude, REALLY...Sell the rights to Paul!"
4,"Good, but it does not contain all the songs from the album.","I bough the CD not realizing that some of the original songs from the album have been deleted and others have been added. All in all ""Rubber Soul"" is still my favorite Beatles album."
5,very highly recommended,this is my favourite beatles cd featuring norewegian wood.ignore the one star reviews and buy this album.
3,Rubber Soul UK version inferior to USA version,"The Rubber Soul that is on sale these days is not the album I bought here in the USA in 1965. USA: I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE is the first song, instead of DRIVE MY CAR. Number 4 on the UK version, NOWHERE MAN, is not on USA. IT'S ONLY LOVE is on USA instead of WHAT GOES ON on UK. IF I NEEDED SOMEONE is not on USA. It's a shame the USA version is not available, because I think it is a better album."
5,I like U.K. version better,"My apologies to the guy from NYC, but this is the superior version. The songs that are ""missing"" from this version ""I've Just Seen A Face"" & ""It's Only Love"" can be found on ""Help"" (the LP they were originally recorded for). However, the American LP does include a false start on the song ""I'm Looking Through You"", not on the UK version. Besides, the American LP is also missing John's 1st non-relationship song ""Nowhere Man"", Ringo's ""What Goes On"", George's ""If I Needed Someone"", & the Mowtown flavoured ""Drive My Car"". Although probably mentioned in others' reviews, Rubber Soul was the transition into bigger and better things!"
5,Beatles Finest Work,"I am a true Beatle maniac, owning every album, and having listened to each of them hundreds of times.Rubber Soul, the 6th LP by the Fab Four, truly defines them as the greatest band of all time, and defines them as amazing musicians.However, to truly love this album you must own Revolver, an amazing album that defines them as artists.Together, they make my day."
4,Release both....,"It would be nice to see both UK and US versions released... either both versions on one disc - if they can fit - or release it as a 2 disc set. Listeners could listen to what ever version they prefer.Perhaps have the UK album in mono, and the Capitol one in stereo.Just an idea, I know it's not going to happen!"
5,A Lilac Wolf and Stuff Review,"This was the only Beatles album my mom had. I found her records when I was a teenager in our basement. I listened to this one so much I had all the songs memorized. The music is simple, light and fun. A little bit of everything all meshed together. The Beatles had fun with their music, and it's obvious in all their albums. I always felt this one was the culmination of all their talent."
5,their best. you had to be there.,"If you were between the ages of 16 to 22 when this album was released you would probably feel this was their best album ever. I was 18. It was a coming of age album. Most of the people that i grew up with felt the same way ( and the ones i am still in touch with still do). My only criticism is that the album had such meaning for me that I can never completely get used to the British version. After so many times on the turntable, the order of the songs from the American version is forever engraved in my brain. I miss the songs that are left out (I'm A Loser), though i do not dislike the ones that have been added ( especially Nowhere Man and If I Needed Someone). I agree with most reviewers who find the song Girl to be a masterpiece. All in all, most boomers would give it a 5."
5,Another additional gem !,"If you just considered the presence of Norwegian moods, Girl and Michelle in this album, there would be by far more than one reason to get this album.Somehow this jeweled set keeps many surprises for you. It establishes a crucial crossroad among them and the rest of the conventional sounds in that age.Originality, innovation and inspiration in their best. What else do you want to get that mythic album?"
1,Home made CD-R,Dr. Ebbetts CD's are home made CD-r's made from vinyl transfers.I'm surprised to see this even here.I've reported this bootleg.Shame on you for trying to take advantage of people.
1,Rubber Soul,This is nowhere near the finest album ever recorded. I'd say somewhere between #100 & #200. I have heard local bands do better than songs like this.
2,Rubber Soul,"So disappointing relative to the earlier Beatlemania sound of 1962-1964. Sometimes change is good. In this case, unfortunately, it wasn't. If you are just discovering the Beatles, this is one of the albums you can skip over."
2,Rubber Soul,"As the previous reviewer has noted, these oldies primarily have nostalgic appeal to people who were around at the time of its release. After 40 years, newer listeners will find that Rubber Soul sounds hopelessly dated, as would be expected."
5,Rubber Soul is one of the greatest albums,"Beatles Rubber Soul is one of the greatest albums. A musical treasure. And when you consider these 4 guys rushed the album, even better!"
5,My Favorite Beatles Album Ever!,"This was the first Beatles album that I had ever listened to. It is awesome with it's opening rocker ""Drive My Car"", then continues into the most meaningful songs the Beatles have ever done during that time period. Every song on the album is great, but my favorite is ""Nowhere Man"". It is so poetic and is a true milestone in the Beatles' careers, from where they were this skiffle group with covers and songs that sounded alike to making a TRUE voice in the music business. From this point on, their music would become legendary. If it weren't for this album until their final one, they would have become just as famous as bands like The Kinks or Herman's Hermits. This album is awesome. ANY rock fan should own this one"
5,"Rolling Stone magazine says,the 5th greatest album ever!!!","Rolling Stone magazine recently did a poll of hundreds of music luminaries,and the immortal rubber soul came in as the 5th greatest album ever.VH1 did a similar poll, with rubber soul coming in 6th.In addition,Michelle won a grammy for being the song of the year in 1966, and In my life was voted song of the century in 2000."
5,Word fail me...,"...as Rubber Soul is one of the best albums ever recorded. There isn't a sore spot on the record, and the price is worth it just for ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown,"" ""In My Life,"" ""Michelle,"" and ""Think For Yourself."" This is an important Beatles album as it is when they really started expanding musically and moving beyond the ""She Loves You"" material. A must for Beatles fans and music fans in general."
1,transition album,"weak! what goes on sounds terrible, if you re listening to in my life, norwegian wood, run for your life are okay.this is not the best album but one of the worst in the 60.White album, blue and red albums one, or abbey road are okay. But this rubber soul is a sophmore jinx!"
1,Rubber Soul,"Every time I see this CD sitting on my shelf I pick it up, look at the song list, then put it back. Even Magical Mystery Tour has better songs."
1,Beatles Worst Besides Yellow Submarine,"There are so many Beatle albums better than this, and every album released previous to Rubber Soul is better - With The Beatles, Hard Day's Night, etc.Also, regarding the production, listen to how abruptly the middle piano solo just ends in ""In My Life"". So obvious that it was a separate track just spliced in and halted when the next verse happened to start. With stuff like Michelle, this album is just plain boring. The best song on the whole thing is by George Harrison - ""If I Needed Someone""."
1,Give Yourself a Lift,"Michelle (re-recorded by countless easy listening artists), You Won't See Me (popular cover version by Anne Murray), In My Life (a popular instrumental tune) are all available without buying this CD. You can hear these at your dentist's office or in most elevators over the muzak system.Really tough to find a great song on this one."
1,Spare me the headache..,"I certainly must admit, Rubber Soul has stood the test of time remarkably well. The music is just as simple, mindless and painful to listen to as it was 35 years ago. Wow, that's longevity.Come on.. the Beatles did nothing more than copy one real artist after another. But since they got more popular than the artists they were ripping off, the ignorant masses believed they were the creative ones. Marketing triumphs over talent once again..."
1,not the best,Ok...but i prefer Jim Nabors...his voice and styling is superior to the Beatles...and a much better actor..
2,Rubber Soul,"Popular poll results tend to rank all Beatle albums highly because of nostalgia and name recognition. Nevertheless, tracks like Michelle and In My Life are now most often heard in their orchestral, non-lyrical form, as background music; and songs like You Won't See Me are more likely to be heard in the Anne Murray cover version.The fact is that Rubber Soul was a departure from the great beat and hooks of Beatlemania, as the band evolved to light pop. Eventually they would return to their rock roots with the release of the White Album.Drive My Car and Harrison's If I Needed Someone Are Good. But it's a 2-star album."
1,$63.00 for what,this is one of the best recording of the beatles albums.if your going to be dumb and charge $63.00 for a low quality cd your crazy. why wouldn't you convert this and all beatles albums into a 5.1 dolby digital dvd audio? then id pay $100.00 for it.to bad most adults and teens don't know how good a dvd audio or an sacd 5.1 dts sounds because if they did the low quality cd would be obsolete.and then everybody would have the best sound they ever heard and be really satisfied!!
2,Sorry Eddie.,"To all the reviewers who give any album labeled ""The Beatles"" an automatic five stars, please get your facts straight. The wonderful praise in the previous review directed to George Harrison for composing ""You Won't See Me"" should, in fact, be directed to Paul McCartney and John Lennon. This is symptomatic of the typical 5-star review.As for Rubber Soul, George's ""If I Needed Someone"" is very good, and possibly the best song on the album."
2,Overrated,"The Beatles should have issued one awesome album by combining the best 12 or 13 songs of Rubber Soul and Revolver.Rubber Soul starts off strong with Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, You Won't See Me and Nowhere Man - then it falls off the cliff with the weak Think for Yourself, The Word, Michelle and What Goes On. Among the final tracks, If I Needed Someone and In My Life are good. If you can burn CDs, just combine the best of the two albums, then you can listen it straight through without songs like Michelle, Eleanor Rigby and Yellow Submarine.I know everyone rates this highly, but I can only justify 2 stars."
4,"Rubber Soul, man!","Probably my favorite album title and one of my favorite albums period. So much good music is here with only a few that I tend to skip (Never a fan of ""Michelle"" for some reason...)Once again this album can't be dismissed as a essential recording, but in the end it your ears that must be the judge.My ears liked it."
5,Transitional Beatles Record,I think that this beatles album really shows the Fab Four's mindstate at that time and the transition between the teen idols into mature artists. It is a must have for any Beatles fan. This is the first album with Harrisons awesome sitar playing.
4,The US version is so much better,"It is hard to listen to this classic album starting with ""Drive My Car"" rather than ""I've just seen a face"". Its like Clapton's Derek and the Dominoes album starting with ""I shot the Sherriff"" rather than ""I looked away"". And having to listen to Ringo singing ""What Goes On"" instead of starting side 2 with ""It's Only Love"" is almost too much to bear. Until Capitol releases a US version, the best that can be done is to buy ""Help"" along with this and cut and paste the album back together on your ipod or mp3 player so new generations of Beatles fans can experience the greatness of the US version. To experience the US version, replace ""Drive my Car"" with ""I've just seen a face"" from ""Help"", replace ""What Goes On"" with ""It's Only Love"" from ""Help"", and also remove ""Nowhere Man"" and ""If I Needed Someone"". ""Nowhere Man"" is a great song but doesnt belong on this album. Try this out and let me know what you think."
3,Another Re-Mastered Joke,"I bought this cd for two reasons. One, I never had the album and wanted it. Two, the advertising about the remastering the way it was supposed to be before the so called executives softened it up because of the following quote:The album was softened up in its original 12-song American edition to jibe with the Dylan/Byrds folk-rock sound, as well as squeeze money from the Parlophone catalog.Well, it sounds the same as the songs on the best of cd's that Apple has put out. I was disappointed. So if you already have the earlier so called ""remasters"" you won't need to buy this one.One other comment, personnaly I'm sick of all this remastering non-sense. I expect to hear a substantial difference when something is remastered. Anything, more bass, bigger drums, screaching guitars, whatever, just something that tells me somebody took the original studio recordings and basically made a new record of it."
5,If you had to pick one of the original releases...,THIS IS IT! A true classic. The fab four were completely hitting their stride at this time! AWESOME! Recommend highly!
2,A Ripping Yarn,"The Author seems to have set out to write a ripping yarn rather than a serious historical analysis. It turns into parochial diatribe about what amazing warriors us Aussies are and how we taught the Germans and Italians a thing or two about how to fight, most of which is simply incorrect.I won't be reading on of his books again."
2,Hard to take seriously,"I wanted to like this book and I do have a genuine interest in the supposed subject of the book, the battle of Tobruk. The author doesn't get there until nearly halfway through the book after some very wide-ranging set-up. The background info on some of the Australian soldiers in the story is understandable. Much of the rest I found to be tedious as someone who is fairly well-read. Perhaps others not so familiar with the broader history of the Second World War will find this aspect of the book more interesting. What bothered me the most was the author's incessant use of slang and even tasteless language. Some of this is acceptable when encountered in a memoir but the author here seems to be trying to spice up the book and it doesn't work for me. This book turned out to be one of the rare books I failed to finish to the end."
3,Getting Better...,"""With the Beatles"" picks up where its' predecessor left off. There is the same balance of covers and originals here, and the formula works just as well.The Lennon-McCartney numbers have improved on their previous efforts, something they would constantly manage to pull off for quite a few years. 'All My Loving' is simply an early gem. In addition, there are other early classics such as 'It Won't Be Long' and 'Don't Bother Me.' My personal favorite though is the relatively unknown 'All I've Got To Do.'The covers are again well polished, and some argue that 'Roll Over Beethoven' and 'Money' actually better the originals. This is debatable, but they are excellent renditions.The Beatles' songwriting was picking up some serious steam though, and pretty soon they would cast aside the covers that filled their early efforts."
5,It's the Beatles!,It's all good/great. A bit surprised that this came in a cardboard jacket and not a plastic container. But that's ok with me. The music is great.
1,Yuck it's awful,The Beatles never sounded so awful. The Beatles only had talent after HELP! This stuff is just so awful words can't describe it
1,Look at the Bright Side,"Well, it doesn't get much worse than this. I guess there was no way to go but up from this point. There is a lot of music that is worth going back in time for. This isn't it."
1,Early Beatles (yawn),"I don't know whats worse, early Beatles or late Beatles. All of these songs are so trite and silly its easy to see that the Beatles were the Hansons and the Backstreet Boys of their generation. I think early Beatles is actually worse, what with that hideous ""yeah,yeah,yeah"" and those laughable suits. This album is a decent early 60s sort of thing but theres really not a memorable song on it and I just bet if it wasn't the Beatles then no one would be playing it today.By the way, if you want a version of the song Money that isn't quite so slick sounding then get the Stones Fazed Cookies album."
2,FINAL ANALYSIS II/With the Beatles,"""how the music would become"" Better than the number one , but not yet a strong album . But they were growing fastly , all my loving for example is beautiful and ""money"" thrilling .their next one would be a complete breakthrough... **"
2,the great cover versions of american rock n roll in the 60's,"The Beatles, as many pop groups do, could not match their debut masterpiece. This one is a lightweight album. We all know that the group had years of club playing in Hamburg to develop their early stuff. You should know that Lennon & co were big fans of Elvis Presley, they wanted to do like him. And then they were doing the cover versions of American Rock and Roll they could play in their sleep. My humble opinion, this album is absolutely tame!PS: Hey the beatles was not alone in the music world. Please check out other better rock bands like Led Zeppelin or Deep purple! their studio & Live albums are more rocking....believe me!"
3,"A step up from ""Please please me""","Production improves with this album. Either The Beatles improved their playing and singing, or George Martin learned some recording tricks. It's probably both.We return to the same enthusiastic, bubbly pop/rock of the previous album, but more precise and disciplined. Because of that, it lacks the raw energy of PPM, but more than makes up for it by the improved production standards and instrumentation. You can't help but smile while listening to this album."
4,"A little sophomore slump, but still good.","This album may not be as great as Please Please Me, it's nowhere near bad. True, compared to ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Boys"", the rocking songs, like ""Money"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" are weak, but they're still good. However, in terms of great guitar playing, this is a keeper. Please Please Me had more vocal line hooks, but the guitar playing is incredible. I'm not a great fan of covers, but ""Til There Was You"" is amazing. It's an old Broadway song. This is done on acoustic guitar, and it sounds like George has been studying classical guitar for 10 years! Also, ""Roll Over Beethoven"" is a good rocker. I don't really like ""Little Child"" and ""Hold Me Tight."" They're ok. This is still pretty good, but I reccomend ""Please Please Me"" more."
5,Meet The Beatles!,"In this incarnation or as the ""Meet the Beatles"" LP, either way a great listening experience. A somewhat short CD, there are definitive versions of Motown songs by John and Paul's best early song All My Loving. As with most of the other Beatles CDs, this needs a major upgrade. Enough room on the CD for a stereo mix or bonus tracks (I Want To Hold Your Hand, This Boy). Not the Beatles album I listen to all of the time but one that is a lot of fun."
5,Beware!,"Though I am pleased with the CD, I mistakenly thought I was buying ""Meet The Beatles"". The covers look identical to the orginal LP, which apparently is not available in a CD."
5,You've really got a hold on me,"""With the Beatles"" finds the boys a little streamlined and thus a little less ravishing, but hardly less attractive. Again, fourteen tracks of classic rock 'n' roll, which equal fourteen tracks of rollicking fun. I especially like their cover of ""Please Mr. Postman"" and George Harrison's ""Don't Bother Me."" They get points for fun, points for consistency, and points for rocking and rolling--even if it is a little too refined."
4,i wish this were re-mastered...,i now have all the official beatles cd's...i only regret emi and the fabs have not remastered these for us...maybe someday...
2,"I own ""Meet the Beatles"" on vinyl.","The vinyl copy in my possession was given to me by my father in the late 70 s. This copy was pressed no later than 1964. The said album is for sale to the highest bidder at a fair starting price of $400. The album has one or two scratches on it, but the quality of sound gives the listener as much pleasure today as if on a ""Hi-Fi"" system thirty-five years ago.R. Lehman 701 Madison Pl. Ann Arbor, Mi. 48103"
3,Sonically it falls short,"I did an experiment. I have 'The Capitol Albums Vol 1.' boxset released in 2004. The first 4 U.S. releases are in there, remastered, with stereo and mono cuts. I made CDs with all three cuts, the Capitols from 2004 and the 2009 Remasters. You can recreate 'With The Beatles' by adding cuts from 'Meet The Beatles' and 'The Beatles Second Album'. I then listened to the cuts one after the other, choosing from each group of 3 the best to my ears. Out of the 14 cuts that make up the 2009 Remastered 'With the Beatles', only 2 were superior, 'Till There Was You', and 'I Wanna Be Your Man'. 'Till There Was You' sounds better I think because it's a ballad with acoustic guitar prominent. I also found the 2009 Remasters worked better with ballads on the 'Please Please Me' 2009 Remaster. It seems that the rocking songs sounded better on the 2004 Capitol Boxset, with an almost even split between stereo and mono versions. Of course they're all superior to the dreadful 1987 releases."
4,Great Album from the Greatest Group,This is a four star album in that is does not come close to the classics that would follow in the Beatles catalogue. This was one of my first exposures to the Beatles and there really are some wonderful songs on this album. All My Loving is worth the cost of the CD alone. Enjoy.
4,Beatles,If you listened and enjoyed the original music of the Beatles'; you will certainly enjoy the remixed sounds with all the new toys and gadgets we have today to listen to them with. Great Sound.
5,Beatles Oldies,This is a mix of original Lennon/McCartney songs and R&B classics such as Roll Over Beethoven. It is good to hear some of the music that influenced Lennon and McCartney as only the Beatles could sing them.
3,Not Essential...But fan will Like it,"I know Many of you wil say, 3 stars? Dont get me wrong, this is a great early album, but there are too many covers, it would've been nice for Lennon and McCartney to write all originals instead or re-writing other artists songs. A good early album but nothing to gloat about."
3,The mono mix is still superior,"If you enjoy the stereo effect of ""music on the left, vocals on the right""...then this is right up your alley...As was true with the first album ...This recording lacks the drive The Beatles were known for.I did what many of you did back on Sept 9th....purchased the entire STEREO catalogue of remasters...and then proceeded to listen to them....only to be very disappointed with many of the stereo mixesMy solution was to go ahead and purchase the MONO REMASTER BOX....it contains the first 10 Beatle albums (up thru the WHITE ALBUM) in true MONAURAL sound...They sound the way The Beatles intended you to hear them...and they capture all the energy and definition of a real Beatle performance.The benefit of having the STEREO REMASTERS....the enclosed booklet and outer jacket are easily worth the $12....They should have included BOTH stereo and mono mixes in the remaster package..sort of how they did with the CAPITOL ALBUM BOX SETS"
5,Money Thats What I Want,"Don't ya just luv those Beatles.Now this is a classic second album that took the world by storm.Starts off with It Wont be long,which is a great tune,that and some of my favorites on the album are,All I've Got to Do ,All My Loving,Don't Bother Me,Till There Was You,Please Mr. Postman,Roll over Beethoven....i'm just about naming every song i know,probably the weakest song is Little Child which would have been a hit for any other band,Hold Me Tight is another brilliant one,you just go through these albums and there is so many sensational songs like You've Really Got a Hold on Me or I Wanna Be Your Man or Devil in Her Heart or Not a Second Time,and it ends with Money which is what i want alot of also."
3,"Where the heck is ""Meet The Beatles""?","Meet the Beatles is the album that has the super hits I Want to Hold Your Hand and This Boy, the tunes that define the early Beatles! Not to mention that there are no Chuck Berry samples on Meet the Beatles, only pure fab four. Now, I have the original Meet The Beatles on vinyl, and that is easily a four and a half album! Now, I realize that Meet The Beatles was distributed by Capitol, not The Apple, so thus it has never been released on CD. However, if you want a true snapshot of the Beatles at this point in time, and see why they initially became the world renowned super band that they were, keep an eye open for the classic ""Meet The Beatles."""
4,Greatest Composers Since Schumann,"The chains of pandeatonic clusters in ""It Won't Be Long"" and the Aeolian cadence of ""Not a Second Time"" place this album in the company of such great works as Gustav Mahler's Song of the Earth."
5,The Beatles Please Please Us Again,"With the Beatles is an exciting album with John and Paul gaining confidence in their own writing. ""All My Loving"" and ""It Won't Be Long"" are standout cuts. This is one of the first Beatles CDs reissued in this format and the package now seems dated and in need of a major upgrade. An improved booklet containing track by track annotations, extra pictures, or behind the scenes information would be appreciated by this Beatle fan."
4,With is not Meet,I have Meet the Beatles and the first songs are: I Wanna Hold Your Hand and When I Saw Her Standing There. Neither of those are even on the WITH album. I have to believe this is different from the Meet the Beatles album.
3,Okay album but it all sounds the same,"Okay first off let me say im a big fan of the beatles but some there early stuff isnt the best. This album was the one that really started beatlemania but all the songs are about the same thing. Love, okay i mean its okay to have that as three of your songs but fourteen 2 minute songs is a little too much. But the beats are good and its a good basic rock album but its not as good as albums like revolver or sgt. pepper etc. Its okay3/5 stars"
5,Peace of mind,"I bought this product for my girlfriend who was moving to a larger city. I did some research and it seemed like Sabre was coming up as the best brand to get. I was looking for something that was compact, had a case and came with a key ring. This one fit the bill.I was also looking for one that offered free shipping. All the other Sabre products did not offer free shipping at the time. This product arrived fast and was exactly what I was looking for.Hopefully she'll never have to use it. I'll sleep a little better knowing that she'll be carrying this though."
2,Really not that good,"I agree with the reviewer who asked why this book got such high reviews from others. There's no explaining taste, but this one is so bad it makes me wonder if it was written by Lynne Graham. It's basically words strung together with every Harlequin concept and phrase put together, but with no feeling. I would have given it one star except that it attempted to deal with infidelity and the consequences to both families and the resulting child. If you are an LG fan, stay away from this one."
2,Not that good at all....,"I truely don't understand why this one has such a high review rating bcs. even though I'm a big fan of LG(I've read at least 3/4 of her books ever published....), I didn't think this one was memorable in any way what-so-ever...."
4,International Lover,"This book is something like a Prince song. It takes you every where. There are stories in this book for every type of woman. Strong, seductive, timid, mild, hot, spicy, teacher, student and all of them rolled into one.The book is a great piece of work and make sure you read my favorite story (the room). I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I do.Kim"
3,REally....,"I liked the book. I love reading erotica and this was my first book written by a man. It was gritty, and seemed honest as far as thoughts the main character had about women. My only issue with the book was the of course the way women are portrayed. Easy, and what man does not like that?? Anyway it is pure entertainment ONLY. I like reading books that make me think...maybe I want to try that. None of the stories in the book made me feel that way. I will say it again Pure entertainment but this was my first book by this author. He may get another shot just to see if all his stories are like this."
2,Contents changed from description,"I like these knives. They are well-balanced, razor-sharp, and quite handsome. However, you do not get what is listed either on the Amazon web-site or on the Wusthof web-site or on the outside of the box. The seller (Bestseller21) forwarded the updated Wusthof contents list and I have included it here. Specifically you will receive a 5"" tomato knife and a 5"" Santoku, but not the 2 3/4"" paring knife or the 6"" sandwich knife. The list below is what you really will receive. I find it disturbing that this change is made with no notification. I am in communication with Wusthof on the disagreement. I have tried to contact them multiple times by phone and email and have received no explanation as to the inaccuracy of the contents.Ten Piece Promo Block Set (Wus8410.pdf)Contains:3"" Straight Paring Knife3 1/2"" Paring Knife4 l/2"" Utility Knife5"" Tomato Knife5"" Santoku, Hollow Ground8"" Bread Knife8"" Cook's Knife9"" Sharpening SteelKitchen Shears17-Slot Block"
3,CYMABLINE!,"I cannot stress enough how great of a song Cymbaline is. Production-wise, lyrics, compostion, melody - this song is perfect. It is one of the 4 or 5 greatest Floyd songs ever. Seriously. It is breathtaking. /but other than Cymbaline & Green is the Colour, this album is kinda boring and ... to be considered a great album. But the 2 hard-rockers (Nile Song & Ibiza Bar) are interesting to hear, but dittys like Main Theme0, Quiksileverm, More Blues, etc...just too many forgettable songs to be one of the best. Obscured by Clouds is leagues ahead of this so get that one instead."
3,GOOD,NOT THEIR BEST BUT IT IS ENJOYABLE IF YOU ARE A HARDCORE FLOYD FAN. CIRRUS MINOR IS AMONG MY FAVORITES ON THIS ALBUM
4,A few undiscovered gems,"I know, this album has continuity of a two year old kid rambling on about breakfast cereal. But come on already, because within this album is the genesis of what is to become pink floyd. Their direction starts to become, well, at least, somewhat clear here. More so, anyway, then it does on their first two albums. Plus, this album is worth owning, just for Cymbeline and Green is the Color, two of Roger Waters early and often forgotten masterpieces. Why Cymbeline didn't make the cut for their greatest hits album, is beyond me. It would have given some much deserved attention to their post syd early catalog."
3,Pink Floyd's 3rd: Counting the score from an unknown flick?,"For the collector, this is a must have. One of the heaviest and roughest Floyd tracks recorded is on this album called The Nile Song, but the overall quality of the music is quite mellow; a forshadowing of Floyd to come.This is a rare occurance where the soundtrack vastly overshadows the movie."
2,Inconsequential meanderings,"More is a soundtrack LP that sounds like a movie soundtrack rather than a collection of 13 songs. There is no consistency of style or sound. An atmospheric doodling like Main Theme is followed by Ibiza Bar, a more ""conventional"" Floyd creation. I bought the LP in 1969. As I didn't particularly care for it then the record has sat in a rack for about 40 years. I won't be reaching for it again soon. Now, if I had seen the movie and could relate the Floyd's tracks to scenes in the movie perhaps I'd feel differently. I really enjoy Tangerine Dream's soundtrack to the movie Thief. The music is meandering at times but suits the tone and content of the movie perfectly. I doubt that I'd appreciate that music if I wasn't so familiar with the movie. As it is, the inconsequential and aimless wanderings of Pink Floyd's soundtrack more than overwhelm any value offered by the couple of worthwhile tracks on the album"
2,One of my least favorite Floyd albums,"I know some people rate this record very highly, but I can't join the chorus on this one. ""More"" is one of the slightest, most inconsequential albums Pink Floyd ever recorded. It was a soundtrack for a Barbet Schroeder film, and in its original vinyl configuration, Side Two consisted mostly of forgettable instrumentals. Side One was better, with three tracks written by bassist Roger Waters that were rather engaging -- ""Cirrus Minor,"" ""Green is the Colour"" and ""Cymbaline."" Overall, though, this album rarely rises above mediocre, and suffers the same fault many movie soundtrack albums suffer -- the work comes off as ""incidental music"" that, when separated from the film, simply does not stand up on its own."
3,Just ok,"This is definitely not one of their best albums. Mediocre at its best.This albums (as most of pink floyd albums )is like a feeling after using some drugs ar hangover..........its psychedelic, but the compositions and the tracks have nothing special with little exceptions in some parts. If you are new to Pink Floyd stay away - start with Dark side of the moon and after this album."
3,First Soundtrack,"1969's More is good but not the best. It does feature some trippy songs like ""Cirrus Minor"",and ""Quicksilver"",but something is lacking here i don't know what it is. Pink Floyd also do there attempt at early heavy metal. ""Ibiza Bar"",""Nile Song"". Still worth getting."
4,PF's first soundtrack delivers!,"Pink Floyd's 3rd album, ""More"", is acually a soundtrack to a film of the same name that came out in July of '69. It is a very interesting album with perhaps the groups hardest rocker, ""The Nile Song"", which leads you to wonder, ""Is this really Pink Floyd?"". But sit tight- the rest of the album is very much of what you'd expect from the early Floyd- moody, psychedlic, and very experimental. Though not my favorite of their early work, it still holds it's own depending on the mood I'm in. It's also the first album that does not have Barret in it AT ALL. I think MOST open-minded people will come to appreciate ""More"" with a couple listens, while still others may not be crazy about it, preferring Pink Floyd's middle to late work. But if you realize they were in the early stages of defining themselves at this time and that their early work won't sound like their more recognizable work, you'll probably like this album."
2,Hmmm...,"I'll be short: not an essential, not their best, not a great album. Read my review written on The Piper At the Gates of Dawn, it might be useful 4 U."
2,"Interesting, but Í did not like","This is an interesting album by Floyd since Floyd did not make much soundtracks and the theme on the movie(which soundtrack this is) is drugs using, and as everyone know Floyd's music during 60's were quite interesting, psychedelic. And as Barrett left and replaced by Gilmour, he was still quite new in Floyd during this album, and the Floyd sound was still coming.Only songs I like in this album are Cirrus Minor, The Nile Song, and Ibiza Bar. The music is good but I personally dislike most of them.This is maybe the only Floyd album in my shelf that gathers dust."
2,"a little hit, but mostly miss","I read somewhere the Floyd recorded this soundtrack in about two weeks. Unfortunately it sounds like it. Worthwhile if only for Cirrus Minor ( a trippy psychedlic piece) and the Nile Song ( hard rock before hard rock was ""hard rock"" ) and More Blues ( a great blues number with an off-kilter, clipped, interupped beat ). What remains on this soundtrack is either pleasantly engaging ( ""Green is the Colour"" , and the pre-ambient/industrial ""Quicksilver"") or downright forgetable ( just about everything else) . Buy it if you LOVE Pink Foyd ( I do, and I did, and don't regret it at all )."
2,NO MORE OF PINK FLOYD MUSIC LIKE THIS THANKS!!,This is totally crap. A couple of exeptional songs but mostly totally crap.
5,I really enjoyed this one...,"At one point this was my favorite album, above all else. Not necessarily only exceeding other Pink Floyd releases, but as well as everything I had in my CD collection. I have listened to this album like mad. Can't get enough of ""Cirrus Minor,"" ""Ibiza Bar,"" and ""Cymbaline."" This stuff used to make me cry every once in a while. It made me feel cool for some reason. It released a sort of chemical in my body that replenished my self esteem. Every once in a while I'll pop it in and remember why I loved Pink Floyd so much.I really reccomend the movie as well. The music really fits in with the characters and their situations."
2,Don't bother.,"If you enjoy Pink Floyd and you would like to collect all of their albums, then buy this one and Obscured by the Clouds. If you want to listen to good music, skip it and buy Relics. There are two worth-while songs on this album (Cirrus Minor is excellent and The Nile Song is notable) and they can both be found on Relics, a collection of early and rare Pink Floyd tracks. The music itself fits the movie well, but if you listen to it separately it leaves quite a bit to be desired."
4,First with David Gilmour on lead vocals.,"More is good, it's not Dark Side Of The Moon but early Pink Floyd is great. After Syd Barrett had to leave the band because of metal illness and a drug addiction, David Gilmour took over for lead vocals. I really like Piper at the Gates of Dawn and they were good with Syd Barrett but David Gilmour is more talented vocally. The band started to put themselves together again after falling apart on Saucerful of Secrets and almost breaking up. They changed their sound a lot, it's less psychedelic than their first 2. Albums overall, more mellow and lighter but a couple songs are hard rock, almost metal and were heavy for the time. If the band wouldn't have continued without Syd Barret and havind David Gilmour do lead vocals, legendary albums like Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall wouldn't be around today."
5,Music From The Film More,"This is one Pink Floyd album most floyd fans should own one time or the other. It is truly a wonderful journey through music. The first song ""Cirrus Minor"" introduces the listener to magical atmosphere only Pink Floyd can create. The lyrics written by Mr. Waters, relates to an out of world experience. The rest of the album is just as interesting with joyful songs such as ""Green Is The Color"" to darker more stranger tracks such as ""Main Theme"" and ""Quicksilver"". All in all a truly excellent album from a group that is known to create quality music."
4,"Strange, scary, thrilling music","I gave this about 3 stars some time ago, but I realized that it wasn't right. I've relistened to this album and have decided that this album is more than the sum of its parts. I believe the best songs here are 'Cirrus Minor', 'Crying Song', 'Green Is the Colour', 'Main Theme', 'Cymbaline', 'More Blues', and the closing track. Alot of this is gentle music and a departure from the style of 'A Saucerful of Secrets', which put more emphasis on the space-rock side of the band (BTW, 'Saucerful...' is the only Floyd album that can really be classified as 'space-rock' anyways). There are a few here I'm not crazy about, but the thing here that really wins me over is that there seems to be an underlying fear beneath the surface of this album. So, I'd give it about an 8.1/10."
5,a great floydian classic,"more is an excellent pink floyd album and is amongst my favourites due to the presence of superb songs like the nile song,cirrus minor and cymbaline.hugely recommended."
1,"""More"" is definately less","This is a soundtrack album from a film NOBODY remembers, and the music is just as forgettable. There's not a single track worth hearing more than once. Early Pink Floyd is an acquired taste to say the least. Better to stick with ""Meddle"" or the hopelessly psycedelic hippie noodlings of ""Ummagumma."" On those discs, Floyd was at least TRYING to record something memorable."
5,Give us MORE LIKE MORE!,"Amazing album, simply Floyd at its creative self. This album has bit of everything...psychedlia with songs like Cirrus Minor and Quicksilver, slow songs like Cymbaline and Green...and even heavy metal (Nile Song and Ibiza Bar)! Superb album"
3,The Floyd becoming The Floyd,"After the loss of Barrett the band took some time to come back together, and ""More"" is proof that they were, with Gilmour, coming together as a band once again. Not everything on here is great, but there are some really lovely songs, such as ""Green is the Colour"" and ""Cymbaline,"" and an overall meditative atmosphere...except of course for the proto-metal stomp songs, which sound more like embryonic punk rock than anything else. A very diverse and underrated album. I agree with other reviewers that I would certainly rather listen to this than endure any of their albums after ""Wish You Were Here."" It is a pity, though, that there is no legitimate Floyd album that captures the heights that the band used to hit when playing extended versions of ""Cymbaline"" and ""Green is the Colour"" live."
3,"some great tracks, some lame","but the bottom line is, make a mix tape with A Spanish Song on there.If anyone in the car recognizes it as Floyd, you have a diehard on your hands.Hide the stash."
4,"""More"" is more; if you're hard core.","If you're a casual Pink Floyd consumer, you may find this album hard to listen to. If you are truly captivated by their early sound and are inclined to avoid the common stuff, then this is essential listening.'Green is the color' is perhaps their strongest ballad ever; its stunning simplicity is pretty well the motif for the entire album. Cirrus Minor, The Nile Song, and Cymbaline are worth noting too. Cymbaline actually made Pink Floyd's set list on tour for a few years."
3,More,"Cirrus Minor from Pink Floyd's More was my introduction to Quadrophonics. I understand it is now called something else but back in the late 60's, it was something special to listen to what appeared to be a bird flying all around the room. More Blues took blues to a different level. Forget the drug stuff. This is innocent compared to much of the music one hears today. Just let the music carry you to exotic lands."
3,Great for travel planning beginners,"If you are new to travel planning, this book is a great source of general information. Each chapter discusses a different aspect of travel: travel insurance, choosing a travel agent, using the internet, booking cruises, airfare and car rentals, and obtaining hotel discounts. Because of the title, I expected to find treasures of hotel chains that offered great prices, or special airfare finds, or wonderful low-cost tour operators. However, no specific travel deals are given. The book discusses how to go about finding hotel discounts, but does not list hotels that offer the best deals. Perhaps they should add ""How to find the. . ."" to the title. Buy the book if you are just learning - it will be very helpful. If you are an experienced traveler, you will know much of what is discussed. The internet information and pros/cons of different guidebook series were the most helpful to me."
3,Firestarr The Dude,The Cd is Ight. It aint have no promotion so i aint ever hear about it/ but the boy fredro is hot. this album got sum hot beats with Reaper's Anthem & California Girls. But i don't think its better than Firestarr. Thug Warz was one of the hottest beats ever in the industry if u ask me. Fredro stll toppin the industry but he known more for actin. Big Ups Firestarr. The Album Ight!

5,MLCS Router Bit Set,"Although I have yet to use this set as I'm in the middle of a house move, the product was as expected in terms of quality and design."
4,Good Bits,Used them on some small woodworking projects and they work fine. Will let u know more when i have used them extensively. For the price its still a great deal
4,appears decent quality,"The set seems to be of decent quality. The box is also of decent quality andI feel I made a good purchase. I visually inspected each piece carefully and the grinding is of relatively nice quality.There were a few tiny (looking really close) dings throughout the set on the cutting edges and a tiny waviness on one of the cutting edges. But I doubt that they will have any significant impact on performance. The bearings don't seem to be of exceptional quality but perhaps they will be sufficient. I am new to using a router so I don't have a super-quality brand bearing to compare. Maybe given the high speed routers run they need to feel slightly looser than in another bearings' application. Also, I can't determine the quality of the metallurgy by looking at it.Overall, you get what you pay for but I'm confident this will be a great starter set."
1,Dull,"The price is great, but the bits were too dull. I cleaned up and tested the 3/4 straight edge and then the 3/8 straight edge with the same results. On a fir 2x4 it was impossible to make a cut and not have large burn marks. Slower or faster, 3/16 deap cuts, etc. didnt make much difference. A Freud 0.5x2CL straight edge bit from HD for $22 cut the same wood with the same router with no problems. Others seem happy with this bit kit, so maybe I got an infrequent duller set."
2,Straight bit broke off during first pass,"The 1/4 straight bit broke off about 3 inches into a 1/4 deep rabbet in very soft pine THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. I haven't used the others yet, but I am not impressed so far. I used a dull Porter Cable bit I've had for years to complete my project, which included 1/4 depth rabbets in walnut. I was told by a saw blade guy that the bits sold in this kind of moderately-priced sets tend to be inferior quality, and he'd never heard of MLCS anyway. I thought he was just saying that because he didn't carry them. I'd have been really annoyed if I'd been using a bit from this set I didn't already have a backup for. I'm going to stick to Whiteside or Porter Cable bits."
3,"The best starter set I found, hands down","If you're buying a router for the first time and have no bits, this seems like an awesome, inexpensive starting point. It lets you get started at a reasonable price, and try a wide range of bits on a full-size 1/2"" shank. The bits cut well, and get the job done.I've had problems with two of them after some use, and would still recommend this as a starter set, but I won't be replacing the broken bits by buying the same set again. The 1/2"" bit that follows a template, the bearing jammed, heated up immediately, and caused some problems (including one ruined bit). The 1/4"" bit snapped off on me today, cutting a 1/2"" deep groove along the grain on a pine board. (Got about 4"" into the cut, then poof.)Not thrilled with the steady self-destruction of bits, but very happy to get a good head start for not too much dough. As ones break, I'm replacing with a bit pricier tools, and I'm alright with that."
2,not sharp,"These so called ""carbide tipped"" router bits are no sharper than my old used steel bits. I tested the 3/4 "" straight bit and it left an unclean ragged channel. I tested the rabbeting bit and it had the same problem (unclean , and for some reason pulled itself downward out of my routers collet making a downward drifting channel in the edge of the wood, and not a true rabbet. I tried a Diablo 3/4 "" straight bit and it cut a clean slot in the wood,Don't buy this set unless you enjoy a lot of sanding or other clean up work later."
4,Router (bit) newbie,"I have never owned a router, and therefor, never owned any router bits. These looked like good value for money and I wanted my bits to be carbide tipped (hoping they would last longer).I have to agree on Jeremy A. Jogan who said his bits were covered in oil and sawdust. It just doesn't make a very ""clean"" first impression when you open the box. I did not yet see any coating that didn't stick well.I have only used one of the bits so far and it did the job. Now the cuts didn't need to be super nicely trimmed and I probably used the wrong lumber (""green"" instead of ""kiln dried"") and didn't apply the right amount of pressure (remember, first time I'm routing anything!) but I did get some bits and pieces that ""stuck to the cut"", making the cut not super sharp. I could probably sand those bits off or do another run, but again, the cuts didn't need to be super nice.All in all, I think I'm gonna have a lot of good use from these bits and I do not regret buying them."
3,It depends on how you look at it,"I bought these as a starter set, having in mind that I would rather quickly learn which bits I would end up using the most and should therefore invest more on.For that purpose, this is a great deal, particularly when you're first starting out with routing and need to learn without destroying really good (and significantly more expensive) bits.The overall quality of the bits is pretty good, perhaps great for the money, but don't think for a moment that they're top quality for a great price. Cuts are adequate but a bit rough. I've used them on pine, poplar and oak so far. Haven't burned any up but they clearly don't have the cut quality of higher cost bits like the Freud quadra series."
3,Cheap but Good,I'd buy again if I were starting out. Its a great set for finding out which bits you use the most. . . they wear pretty fast in hardwoods so you'll know which ones to replace with high quality bits pretty quick. I still use some of them for that odd - one off cut.
3,not disapointed,"These seem like a usable set of bits, probably worth the price. I am a little concerned at the quality of the bearings, many seem to be loose and other reviewers have reported a problem with them. First use did give nice smooth results. Definitely worth the price but not any more than that."
5,Great starter set for a new router owner!,"I needed some straight bits for box joints and dados, so I purchased a kit instead of buying them individually to save money. This left me with several edge cutting bits I never would have bought on my own that now I might try along with a rabbeting bit I'm using quite frequently now. All the kit lacked for me was an 1/8"" straight bit which I picked up inexpensively for 1/4 the cost of this 15 piece set."
4,15 Piece Set Router bits,"Very nice case with row holders that can be lifted out and your bit can be pulled out. Bits are sharp and are a little sticky from packaging. Bearing was missing but MLCS is on the ball and shipping one at no cost. Bits are a little tight in slots so care must be taken when pulling out of holder.Update... have used a few of the bits and they work quite well, clean off the sticky coating before use and clean after each use, used windex and did fine job. Received the missing bearing as promised, great customer relations."
3,Dull,"This is a nice ""beginners"" set with respect to selection. However, when they arrived it was clear that the bits were dull. I ended up spending more to get them sharpened than the entire set cost. It will be interesting to see how well they hold an edge. I am not optimistic.Spend the extra money and buy Freud bits."
4,Nice value,"It has a ton of bits obviously for a low price. It definitely will come in handy and save you money.However, during the first project I did using the set (making some speaker cabinets) the 1/4"" straight bit broke while cutting out a hole in 3/4"" mdf. It wasn't being pushed hard either. I was doing the cut in 3 passes getting progressively deeper with each pass and on the 3rd pass it broke off. Fortunately it was in the wood and didn't go flying into my leg/face and cut me up :PWould this affect my decision to recommend this kit? Absolutely not. It's still a great and useful kit and an unbeatable value. It is worth mentioning though so you can be prepared to buy higher quality versions of the bits that you will use most frequently."
4,Nice Set,"Looking at this set online makes it hard to see exactly what you're getting in a kit. One piece that is missing is the outer bit for doing the dove tails. You get the slot portion, but not the outer one."
4,good bits at great deal for mult.,i like to buy a good selection of sizes and sell them indiv. these are great!!!
4,MLCS router bit set,"Have not used this set yet, but its appears well made. If the box they came in is an indicator, this set should be very good."
3,Getting deep into the series here...,"The whole series was actually based on an amusement park ride, so I guess the very idea that there are so many films from it is a bit telling, but it is fun and we wanted the whole series. Like the fact that it also comes with a DVD so we can watch it in the car or on our laptop, if we want to."
1,Poor streaming performance,"This is a review more on the experience and not the movie itself (which isn't that great). We streamed most of the movie via the PS3. We started around 4:30 PS EST. By the time we got to the last 30 minutes of the movie we hit the dreaded buffering problem that seems to be very prevalent, and limited to, streaming on the PS 3. The last part of the movie was delivered in 15-20 second bits with 15-20 seconds of buffering in between. BE VERY WARY OF STREAMING VIA A PS3.As far as the movie itself, this movie goes well off the map and by the end I don't really care who lives, dies or whatever. I just wanted it to end."
2,Third try isn't always the charm,"Being a fan of the Pirates movies I couldn't wait to see the third, until about 5 minutes into it. I was confused for most of the movie because, like in all the movies, the plot-line is constantly shifting and you never know who's on whose side, but in this one it's taken a bit to the extreme. Unlike most movies that you find yourself wanting to shout out to the main character, you instead are hoping he will shout out to you and let you know what the heck is going on, the whole thing seemed like a big gag being played on the viewer. Suspense is fine and dandy, but keeping the viewer in the dark through most of the movie isn't something that lures me towards a flick. If you're a fan of Pirates do not see this movie, just come up with your own ending and I assure you it will be better. The one thing that saved this flick from a one star is the cast, which cannot be beat."
3,Disappointing,"Although it is still fun to watch, this movie causes some confusion and chow yun fat was lost in the mix. Too many plot twists and ulterior motives for each character. Too bad as this could have been the best of the three but it was not."
2,"Suddenly, Dead Man's Chest was a good movie...","Curse of the Black Pearl was outstanding, an instant classic. Dead Man's Chest was mediocre at best. The story in this one was very convoluted and hard to follow and some sequences were just outright silly. I will say that Kiera Knightley looks best in this movie. All of Depp's funny one-liners were exhausted in the first film, and I didn't like how Capt Barbossa's unique charisma from the first film suddenly got reduced to 'sidekick' in this one.As I said, Kiera is good eye candy. Beyond that, watch the first one and second one and call it a day."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End,It's that good. This movie was so filled with goodies. Tons of other great things this movie is packed with. Very entertaing and fun to watch.
1,Phony Effort,"This movie was made for money. It is bad in almost every way ... acting, plot, CGI ... and a confusing mess that deserves to be thrown at 100 KM per hour straight into faces of the producers, the director, and its stars. I figure since it is such pain to watch, they, the creators, deserve some too..."
5,Just like the theaters!,Blu-ray gives a perfect transition of the theater to home on this title. Well worth the buy!
4,"Great budget and effects, but poor story line...open for P4?","This will be quick; the title pretty much says it all. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (Blu-Ray) was good, but not great. The story line was mediocre at best, but the redeeming quality in this film was the production, the special effects, the extra/special features. Also, the possibility of a Pirates 4 is appealing, which would again give the writers a chance to redeem themselves. The fact that I saw this on Blu-Ray also helped with the four star rating. Overall, this film is worth watching, but I would definitely recommend the high-def version!"
5,as funny as ever,"great battle scenes and the cast is as funny as ever. of course you have to see the other two movies to know what is going on, but these movies are great and recommended for everyone!"
4,Whatever you do.... read this!,Please take my advice and whatever you do: 1) DO NOT sit close to the screen or you will have a terrible time trying to see everything that is going on. We had to sit close and it took a lot away from our experience; 2) DO NOT leave until the VERY END. Stay for the credits. I left right at the last scene with Jack and now I'm regretting it! There is a wonderful surprise in store for Will/Elizabeth fans at the very end.
5,Fantastic!,"Extremely pleased with this Bluray DVD! This is the first one I've purchased since I've got my player, and this movie was fantastic!The graphics are out of this world! I was also pleased with the purchase price, as well as the delivery time."
1,"Pirates of The Caribean, At Worlds End.","I would review this item if I could,perchased on the 12 December 07.I HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT YET."
2,a huge blockbuster with no clear story,The third film of the pirates series is probably the most epic in terms of visual effects and scale but storywise it was very difficult with too much going on. Had it been released in say 2008 or 2009 I think it would have been easy for me to follow the story. The fact that it was released in 2007 a year after Dead Man's Chest made it difficult and possible for me to comprehend what was happening in the third movie. I could understand the story a little bit but the fact that there was too much going on in the third film made the story difficult for me to understand what was happening in the movie.
1,Incorrect Region Code,"This review relates to the incorrect information contained on the packaging, and does not reflect on the movie itself. This disc was purchased to be played in the UK (on a region B player). The packaging on this disc clearly states that it will play in regions A,B and C. The actual discs are labelled as only playing on region A. The disc would not work in the region B player.Thanks a lot Disney, yet again another con-job by the Mouse."
3,Pirates are cool,"I love the Pirates trilogy so much! It's my absolute favorite movie series ever. At World's End is my least favorite. It has a lot of humor, but the overall storyline is just not as good as the first 2 movies. It's still a great movie though and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,yoho me harties,In the final third installement all the answers to all the questions will be answered. Will Barbosa and the others make it to worlds end. Will they free Jack sparrow and stop Lord Becket and vile davie Jones and at what cost will there victory demand in order to be fullfilled. Find out in the thrilling heart warming and action pack final to the pirates triology wioth laughs and thrills ffrom begiining to end. If you like this I recommend Pirates of Carribean curse of the Black Pearal and The dead man's chest.
2,Jaws-dropping special effect but not as funny as the first installment,This movie contains jaws-dropping special effect but it's not as funny as the first installment. It also drags in a lot of scenes.It's still worth renting.
3,"Treachery, treachery, everywhere...","Okay, so get a piece of paper out before watching this film, you have to write down who is doing a deal with who to get what they want and who is going to betray who. It's just one long story of someone betraying and getting caught. While they did clean up the story at the end, no lose ends, they did leave it open for a 4th or more movies, which I think they have exhausted with these writers, time for some fresh injection.Effects were good, no real big surprises. Jack is still confusing and confused as usual. Some new pirates are introduced, but never really given a chance to develop, including Jack's Dad.All in all, good to watch and finish out the series, but I've decided not to add to my library."
5,GREAT,"Hasen't came out yet but bet its as good as the first 2 and they should of called it ""Pirates of the Caribbean:In Antartica"" lol!Great movies!"
3,not as good as the first but still decent,"first, i just wanna say that if you'r usually not a 3-hr-long movie fan, then this is probably not for you. partly b/c this sequel was not as good as i expected. it has way too many characters and they somewhat interferes w/the flow of the film...making it fall apart if you will.w/that being said, i think overall this is a decent enjoyable film, even tho there were times where i almost fell asleep. parts of it were a little bit on the confusing side (well i was almost snoozing) but i watched the ending twice and i finally got it (lol).despite the fact taht this was not as good as the original Pirates of the caribbean, its humor and action will engage you to a certain extent. however, this is not a must see. but if you'r a diehard pirates fan, then by all means, go watch it."
2,Nooooooooooooooooooooo,"I loved the first one, loved the second one not quite as much, the third one left me wanting to scream ""Noooooooooooooooo"".I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone, so if you haven't seen it yet, DON'T READ THIS!The chemistry between Jack and Elizabeth was just written off. I wanted to see more from them. Nothing.If Elizabeth wanted boring, she chose it. Just about everything that has ever happened between her and Will, she had to start. Compared to Jack, he is still in the boy department.Elizabeth, they soooo short changed your character. Would you ever have been satisfied with what the ending of this movie gave you (stay through the credits). Now I picture you working out a deal of spending one day with Will every ten years, and nine years + three hundred and sixty four days with Jack sailing the high seas. Now that would be fulfilling. Yo Ho.Hope the fourth(there has to be one)movie gives us back the charm of the first one. I'll be waiting."
3,"A Strain of Credulity, at that!","The best way to get to world's end is to be lost, because if you're lost you'll be able to find any place that cannot be found.With swashbuckling at an absolute minimum, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) still manages to provide a lively presence, enough to keep the plot on course. The film is best seen after the ""Black Pearl"" episode and I should think, other episodes.Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom return but can't do much in the land of the dead, where romance is more or less for the living and that subtracts from the overall entertainment value of this flick.The two disc Limited Edition set is beautifully encased and the second disc includes bloopers and deleted scenes.And that's about it."
4,An Awesome Film!!!,"This is a really good sequel that takes place not long after the last one. Captain Jack Sparrow is dead, but his crew need him alive because is is one of the pirate lords, so the crew travel to world's end to bring Jack back. Lord Cutler Beckett is executing people who are suspected of piracy, and holds Davy Jones' heart. During a pirate meeting, Elizabeth is elected Pirate King, and she declares to go to war with the East India Trading Company. One of my favorite parts is when there is an epic battle on the Black Pearl and Captain Barbossa performs a marriage to Will and Elizabeth. I highly recommend PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN AT WORLD'S END!!!"
5,Another stellar performance by Johnny Depp,"I think I still like the 2nd Pirates the best, but as a Pirates & Johnny Depp fan, World's End is no less entertaining. I thought parts of it were a little drawn out but the Bonus Features are totally worth watching & enhance appreciation of whole mega-production & special effects. The only really lame scene I thought was the wedding in the midst of the big deck battle. And the part where Keira Knightly screams a pep talk to the crew was a little annoying but all-in-all another great adventure film & must-have for any fan of the Pirates trilogy."
2,At World's End is one of the worst movies in the history of the world.,I'm pretty sure I've already said it all. You've probably already wasted three hours of your life watching it but for those of you that have not... heed my words... don't waste your time.
2,"Incredible picture, but a poor script!","Just let me start by saying that I have a Samsung 1400 player and I experienced no problems with playback. The picture is the best I have seen yet on Bluray but the movie itself was not very good. There were millions(seemingly) of subplots that were only provided with about 5 minutes of explanation and then the cannonball fight scene in the end was over 48 minutes. This made for an overly confusing storyline that could have been portrayed much better. The movie was too long as well, nearly three hours. Not worthy of the Pirates franchise in my opinion, but a stunning display of Bluray capabilities none-the-less."
2,This is a Disney movie?,Overall action and special effects are good. Story ending is not very good in my opinion. As a Disney movie I expected a better ending.
4,Dark Journey of Misdirection and Magic,"The setting is darker and the situation more desperate than the first two of the Pirates movies. The tension between the various characters and the obvious differences in their motivations and agendas makes for a very tangled plotline--one that gives the filmmaker ample opportunity to take the audience on a journey filled with misdirections and sleight of hand. As always, the Pirates franchise is filled with magical or supernatural elements. This is where the true fun of the movie lies. The climax of the movie (don't worry, no spoilers) is so full of this supernatural mythos that it almost takes your breath away while you try to figure out which of three or four possible resolutions is going to unfold, and how it will come about.The movie gets my ""full-price at the theater and then buy on video"" rating."
1,just pathetic.,"overacting, incoherent and meandering dialog and script, nothing made sense, nothing was cohesive, the plot was mindless boredom. Total crap and to think another is coming forth soon. Horrendous over acting, simpleton scenes with big name stars in trite horrid dialog. What a shame. Actors became objects of their own ego's and then think every scene they do is immortal, timeless. Its obvious this franchise is in it for the bucks, as the lemmings will salivate to the theater to see films like this, but we all know they are marketed for the very lowest common denominator of film goer.TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE garbage."
1,For Shame Disney......,"Wow. Please, if you are reading these reviews to see if you should see this or not, ...do it as a last resort. Disney should be paying you to watch this. Is this all what movies has come to these days, money and more money. This is the BIGGEST piece of Garbage Disney has ever put out, (besides Captain EO)Please! Don't buy this!, Dont Give disney another excuse to make a horrible movie. Steal it, sell your soul, whatever you want to , to watch it! But i warned you! Do not pay good money for this horrible Nightmare of a movie."
2,Disappointing,"This is probably the most disappointing film I have ever seen.I used to be a huge fan of the other two and was so excited for this one,but once it begun,I just wanted to leave.I was seriously considering walking out from the cinema,but I kept telling myself it was going to get better.It didn't.After what seemed like forever it ended,taking a dear obsession away from me."
1,Like Sticking Hot Needles In Your Eyes,"God, how I hate this flick! I can't believe my sister got it for me for Christmas! Great cast. I hope they got nice paychecks so they can make better movies for scale. At 2 hours it would be merely bad. At nearly three hours it makes you almost suicidal. Bad writing and badly staged action sequences are the main culprits here. Do yourself a favor and check out the ""Matrix"" sequels or the Joel Schumacher ""Batman"" flicks instead of wasting your time on this dreck."
3,A dissapointment,"I seem to be the only person-judging from most of the reviews- who was not thrilled with this film! I thought they set up situations that were never fulfilled-I hated the way they just did away with Elizabeth's father-and it seemed they just started killing off characters because they'd forgotten what to do with them...senseless! ...and the ending with Will and Elizabeth's love story was really a downer-as was the ""love"" story with Calypso and Davy Jones... Davy was just dispatched with no resolution to his story line and she was released and didn't follow through on anything she said she was going to do... No one seemed to get what they wanted in this movie...On the flip side it had great action, wonderful fight choreography and was beautifully filmed-However it just at the end of the long day left me, as the audience member, feeling empty... Maybe they've saved the resolutions for Pirates IV-and if so I might just wait for the DVD to come out..."
1,Pretty Bad,"I saw the first two Pirates of the Carribbean movies and found them charming, especially Johnny Depp's rollicking portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. ""At World's End"" I pre-ordered on that basis, and I'm really sorry I did.It's way too long, way too many characters, way too much action---it seems like every five minutes something is blown to kingdom come---and it just smacks way too much of ""Let's do another one to make money!"" It's too bad. Keith Richards' famous cameo is really tiny, and so much more could have been done with it. He's no Leonardo di Caprio, but Keith did fine with what they gave him to do.All in all, quite disappointing."
3,You have got to be kidding...,It came in like a storm and went out like a wimper. Where was the excitement? What happened to the writers? Did they get a hand cramp and forget how to put a great movie together? It doesn't deserve 1 star but 4 or 5 would be way too high. I think it could have been better. The ending stinks. The cast is still there but the story was abandoned!
1,WHAT was that!!!,I preordered this movie could not wait to get it.I did not get it was lost threw the whole movie. watched it again thinking i would get some clue but still did not get it.What is with the peanut?? Great rental not a buy. The extra fotage was better then the movie.
1,"no, it's not that good","""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a rollicking voyage in the same spirit of the two earlier Pirates films""So says Amazon, I say nay, it's an overbloated, inconsequential pile of doo-doo. And I say that as a fan of the first and second one (although the second one was inferior to the first).What's with hollywood and sequels/trilogies. I don't mind them if they are great (i.e. LOTR) but this one seemed rushed to me and the main problem was the script. Too many plot-lines to even bother with.As much as I wanted to like this one, I hated it. Maybe it will be better the second time, maybe I was just not in the mood, maybe I was too tired, maybe this film just stunk."
1,I'LL assume it's going to suck,"I haven't seen the film, neither have the people who posted before me. But that didn't stop them from assuming how something's going to turn out before actually experiencing it. I did not realize you could write reviews for movies you haven't seen, books you haven't read, or music you haven't listen to. People have given this yet-to-be-released movie 5 stars just because they loved the preceding movies. Well, I didn't care for Dead Man's Chest. Therefore, I give Worlds End 1 star for effort.P.S. To others who may review this movie before seeing it, you're not helping anyone. In fact, you're doing nothing but a disservice to people who use this website and take reviewers' words into account before making purchases. Amazon is not a fan-based message board where you post about your anticipation - that's what IMDb was created for. Please, kindly leave the reviewing to people who've seen/read/listened to the item in question."
5,Johnny Depp Does it Again,"If you are a Johnny Depp fan as well as a Pirates of the Caribbean fan this 2 disc dvd movie ""At World's End"" will be one you will want to add to your collection! It is a definite must-have for Johnny's movie fans!Dolores in Texas"
2,At Worlds End,Was just an ok film. Was extremely hard to follow who was backstabbing who when and how. I found myself fading away from the movie more then once through it. The special effects was awesome and maybe when I watch it again I'll be able to follow it better. I honestly was looking forward to this after the 2nd installment and I guess I was somewhat dissapointed.
4,Nice Finish,This wasnt as good as the first but was still a good watch. The acting and graphics were just great. The problem is they just tried to cram too much story at you at one time. I would definetly recomend getting and watching this movie. All of the original characters are back which is really hard to do these days. Johnny Depp does a great job especially the more than one Jack scenes(watch and youll see what i mean). great extras and features on the discs.
3,Ok movie but..,This movie was kind of a let down after the other 2. Seemed like the writers were to busy giving ending to all the numerous sub-plots that came up in the other 2 to give this movie a plot of it's own. It started dragging on and on. I t had some funny parts and such but it ended being just another average movie.
4,Prepare to get wet,"Your favorite Disney pirates are back for a third time and the cinematic trilogy is in the books. Comparing At World's End to the previous two films, this is the weakest of the three. While the weakest, it still remains strong in it's own right - it is fun, enjoyable, and even gripping (see: final scene).Much like a brewing storm at sea, the story is slow at first with overlapping story lines, but something thrilling can be sensed in the distance. After a splash of humorous Sparrow mannerisms and crew assembly, the pace picks up midway through. Escapades and twists ensue, and The Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman meet in a swirling maelstrom battle which is bound to leave you soaked in awe and admiration."
3,Letdown,"Like a lot of people, I was very excited about the new ""Pirates"" movie. The problem isn't that it is very long (although it was), but rather than even with this length, too much was wedged into it.The result? Confusion. You're never sure who is on whose side, and it seems to change every few minutes. And not in a good way, but more of a ""this should have taken 30 minutes to develop, but we need to do it in 3 minutes"" way.Jack Sparrow actually becomes less charismatic with each movie. In this one, he seems upstaged by Geoffrey Rush.And I can't begin to understand what's up with Sparrow. No explanation was ever offered.All told, great effects, and a decent ending are not enough to save a nearly incomprehensible storyline."
1,Thank goodness I didn't buy this one!,"Muddled. Incomprehensible. Just plain bad. I'm not sure what movie everyone else watched, but the Pirates 3 movie I watched was horrible! And plus, it was just another sequel setup. That's enough, Disney."
4,Good Movie,"If you have #1 & #2, you have to get #3. Besides, if you love Johnny Depp, you just hafta..."
2,Pirates of the Carribean,"Most movies should be left at two sequals, and this is one of them. A disappointment,hard to follow."
4,Sigh...,"Pirates of the Caribbean was one of the best crafted movies I've ever loved. I'm guessing that a bigger budget for 2 and 3 led to an entirely different mindset. They are still entertaining and have wonderful moments, but the exquisite quality of Caribbean was lost in a lot clutter. The battle at the end of End redeems aimless minutes and recaptures the momentum but you'd have to be a sincere enthusiast to love them (2 and 3) as much as the first. End is still worth seeing and owning."
5,Great movie! Great Blu-Ray!,"I never got to see this in theaters, but I loved 1 and 2 so this was a no brainer for me. I was really impressed by the great conclusion to the story. As for the picture, it's almost flawless. In a few scenes, the picture is a bit grainy, but that's it. The sound is perfect and the special features are great. Highly recommended."
1,"Pirates of the Carribean- ""At World's End""","This movie, the third in the series, did not captaviate my interest. Seems the movie was released to the public riding on the heels of their first two successful series movies. The movie fell far below my expectations. Not worth the money!"
2,Slow and unfullfilling....,Very dissapointing indeed. Curse of the black pearl & Dead man's chest were much better. Some how in World's End it was like arriving at a destination after much anticipation only to be let down...even the slap stick humor didn't have quite the same effect as in one and two. Yet the special effects and costumes were the high point of the movie for me.
3,"Interesting, but not as good as the first.","It tied up the series so it was an acceptable end, but I wouldn't highly recommend it for someone who wasn't a fan of the other movies."
5,Good End To A Great Trilogy...,"The movie picks up where the second leaves off and as expected, very exciting. Visual effects and audio are stunning and Capt. Jack is funny as ever. I'll save the over-long, pretentious, me-too review for the self professed critics of the world (just buy it and watch it),but I will say this much - for the negative postings on here (and from so many other reviews I've read....), it's a MOVIE people!! It's not supposed to be a thought provoking commentary on history. It's produced and brought to the screen for ENTERTAINMENT. Get over yourselves already and lighten up - save your bad vibes for the cat."
1,Completely Dreadful.,"One of the worst and most dissapointing sequals ever. The plot is so convoluted that you don't really know what it is that anybody is trying to do. It starts off with a mission to free Jack Sparrow from Davey Jones Locker. Fair enough, done in the first 20 minutes of the movie. From then on it jumps from Will trying to save his father from Davey Jones to rounding up all of the pirate kings (huh?) for a battle with some British guy who is portrayed as a bad guy but doesn't really do anything bad. Will switches sides two or three times, and the ending is so unsatisfying that I wish I had never watched the movie. I would rather just remember the first installment as the great movie it was and banish the next two from my memory."
1,Absolutely atrocious film.,"I loved the first ""Pirates,"" but this third installment is truly one of the worst movies ever made. Great performances by the cast, and captivating special effects, but a horrendous script and completely convoluted plot-lines.One of the worst movies ever made."
4,"Awesome movie, Awesome quality","This was the first blu ray DVD I have ever watched on my HDTV. The quality of the picture was just so clear and amazing. It does have a slight edge over DVD quality, but for the price of Blu Rays still, I would say get a HDMI upconverting DVD Player and you should be just fine. If Blu Rays were a little more expensive than DVDS, I would buy them, but they are way overpriced at the moment because their the next big thing!"
3,Disappointing lack of extras on the 2-Disc edition,"I love the POTC franchise and as a fantasy writer, I appreciate the detail that went into the plot - especially the little things like the sword Will crafted (track it through the movies and watch where it goes). The extras on the 2-disc edition of Dead Man's Chest were pretty good. And the commentary was informative and entertaining. There is NO commentary on the 2-disc edition of At World's End. The rest of the special features are short and rather disappointing. Now that I've seen them once, I wonder why I bought the special edition. It wasn't worth the extra $6 or $8. For die-hard Pirates fans, this edition is disappointing. I can only hope a better ""special"" edition will be released later that has the commentary and some more insightful goodies to enjoy."
1,Horrible!,"""At World's End"" is one of the top 10 worst movies I've ever seen. The plot made no sense and the acting was overdone. Boring doesn't even describe how terrible this movie is. I'm surprised Johnny Depp would agree to do such a wretched movie. This film doesn't even deserve one star.Very disappointing especially since the first ""Pirates"" movie was very well done.I haven't seen the second one and don't want to after watching this train wreck. I am turned off to the whole ""Pirate"" series."
3,Still Charming,"I have been a fan of Disney and Depp for many years and while this is no where near as good at the first one, ""At World's End"" still has great performances by Depp, Geoffrey Rush, and Chow Yun-Fat. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not really that interesting to watch because there is no real character in their performances. The best thing about this Disney movie that saves it is that it does not have a ""Happy Disney Ending"". Without saying what happens, there seems to me to be a more realistic conclusion for all the characters. Depp is still brilliant and his Capitan Jack is one of the most memorible screen heroes in the last two decades. At 2:45, ""At World's End"" is almost unbaribly long and you will not miss much if you fast forward a bit, but again, the conclusion is still satisfying."
3,seems more like a kid's movie than a serious one,"Disney keeps on rehashing ideas from ""The Little Mermaid"". They did it in this film, they did it in Shrek 2, they did it in George of the Jungle. When is disney going to learn to just go with the flow and stop re-using ideas and themes because they think it will make them money?The first movie had wit, and even though it was supernatural, it did feel ""real"". The 2nd movie and the third movie felt more like fairy tales lost a lot of the wit that was evident in the first movie. I'd give this movie 2.5 stars if I could.Yeah, Davey Jones died, and now we'll have to change all our myths to reflect this fact. Let's hope a goddess or god doesn't get killed in the next movie. Who knows, maybe zues will die in the next movie."
5,Just What I Wanted!,"Just what I wanted! Super quick shipping. All ready to wrap for the Christmas Holiday. I would rate this transaction A+,A+,A+,A+I'll be back!"
2,At World's End: Real Review,"Jack Sparrow is back again and so is Turner, Swann, and Barbossa but oh wait Comedy didn't return...thats a shame. Yes that is right all the pirates came back to close out the epic but all the jokes drowned.The Curse of the Black Pearl was great, Dead Man's Chest was good, but while watching World's End I couldn't wait for the end to arrive. Visually the movie was exciting and the top of the line graphics were savey but the plot didn't shiver me timbers. Much like Dead Man's Chest the story was dilutted with too much insignificant back story accompanied by enough pirate deals and schemes to twist your head.So if you loved Dead Man's Chest go and see the finale, but if you didn't like the sequel don't waste your money on the third.I prefer the ride at DisneylandC"
2,Quality - Going..Going..GONE!,"Inappropriate for kids, unenjoyable for adults, Pirates 3 is a tragic example of quantity overriding quality.I knew this film was going to be bad when the supposedly fantastic, light-hearted story started off with A MASS HANGING - INCLUDING CHILDREN BEING EXECUTED. Then things got worse.Aside from the usual stabbings, gunfire and swordplay, women are graphically shot in the head. Ha-Ha, boy this sure is funny? In between the mayhem, the film is not very engaging and Depp's ""drunken pirate"" routine really gets old the third time around.The first Pirates film was a refreshing take on the old pirate movie genre. This 3rd installment is a loud, violent mess. Watch it once if you are curious about how the story ends, then forget about it."
3,1080p vs. 1080i,"I ordered all 3 movies in Blu-ray format. The first two movies' packaging correctly puts the video resolution at 1080p which I want for my 42"" plasma tv. However, looking at the packaging (cardboard sleeve and plastic case) of the third and last movie, it states the video resolution is 1080i, which is less than perfect. I don't know if it's a misprint or if they really are releasing 1080i versions with 1080p ones. Anyone else have this discrepancy?"
5,Expectations met,This was a well received gift for an important person in my life. Product exactly what was expected and shipped promptly.
5,Awsome!,I love this movie! Just as good as the others. It is perfect for watching on snowy days. Johnny Depp is at his finest!
2,Ho-Hum I needed a bottle of rum,"I loved the first movie, found the second to be typical sequel, yet entertaining material, but this one......I was falling asleep (maybe it was my 14 hour work day) within the first 20 minutes. Too many new twists and characters were added, which totally diuluted the most entertaining characters. Anyway, Captain Jack Sparrow is still fun to watch. The whole Chinese pirate thing was not."
2,the first one was better,"yea, the first one was better. the second one was less confusing. I think if this one was not as confusing, it still wouldn't be very good. Because I don't think I'd really care about what's going on in this movie even if I understood it 100%.This one...has some cool special effects and thats about it.And this is coming from a sci-fi/fantasy fan, so even I can't be so biased as to say it's top-notch. Go watch lord of the rings again or something. maybe star wars episode III."
3,pirates of the caribbean at the worlds end,"There was something about this one of the series that just didn't have that ""WOW"" affect. It seemed long, yawn! Don't get me wrong I liked it but I really liked the first two. Maybe that's it I am a little burnt out on them, then again I'd be right there in line to buy a ticket if they made a fourth movie in the series. I did like the ending where the lovers had to leave each other, oops spoiler! I did buy it to add it to my collection. The fish sailors were hard to watch too, I got the ghost sailors but the fish men were hard to believe in. I have to say it has action and battle scenes so give it a try and see what you think!"
4,Not like the others,"When I saw this movie at the theaters I was amazed at how boring it was.But when it was realeased in Bluray I had to buy it beacuse i already owned the others. I dont know why but I seriously enjoyed it more at my house than in the theaters.This movie is really different than the other pirates maybe becausse its ten times darker than Dead man chest and the even crazier story[ i wont ruin it]THe movie comes in two discs, one disc with the movie it self and the other is jampacked wih extras, a lot of interesting content especially the bluray exclusive maelstorm which is a interactive extra of how they made the movies' funnest scene.I rate the movie 3/5 starsthe visuals 4.5/5and the extras 5/5P.S wathc after the credits for a really cool scene"
4,A good inclusion in the series.,"A lot of people gave this film a bad review. I don't really understand why. It's a pretty unique film especially for being a third in a series. Look at Spiderman 3, A complete absolutle 360 almost a parody of it's two predecesors. POTC3 was different, It takes a story and evolves it into a realm completely otherworldly. I have read some reviews of the plot being not very beilievable, but Pirates being cursed and running around a ship with nothing but their bones showing is pretty hard to consume as the truth as well. Acting (except for Kiera knightley who is the worst in the whole series) is great. Depp, Rush, Fat, they all do a great job. the story is a little confusing and yes the movie is very long, but a ""unique"" addition to the series. Not the best and not the worst... If they didn't make it you would all be clamoring for it, the fact is, it's here and it's not that bad, get over it."
4,LOVE the movie but the Bonus footage on DVD falls short,"I absolutely love this story, as crazy and convoluted as it may be at times. Its fun and the more times you watch it, the more you ""get it"". But I was REALLY looking forward to a director commentary or commentary by the writers or somebody, anybody. There is no commentary on the movie at all. On the deleted scenes, which amounts to two, there is the option of commentary but it sounds like the director is reading something off a cue card. There are some behind the scenes stuff as to how the film was made, but overall, not as robust as what was on the first two film's bonus DVDs. Frankly, had I known, I'd have just bought the plain single disc DVD and saved some money. I do wish Amazon would make it a policy to list all the content on the second disc of any DVD set. I just looked at the new Harry Potter DVD due out Dec 11th and there's no listing of content on that bonus disc either."
5,Pirates 3 = great movie!,"I have to admit.....when the first Pirates came out I was one of those people saying it would be stupid and I would never watch it, but after some persuasion from my sister-in-law, thought I would give it a chance and you know what....I LOVED IT! I was hooked. I loved Dead Man's Chest and I could not wait until At World's End came out. It turned out to be just as adventurous and fun as the first 2! I am now PIRATES OBSESSED! And I loved that they kept the same characters through all 3 movies. I recommend this movie and the first 2 to everyone!"
2,Hollywood state of the art special effects.,"I am not a big fan of fiction, even in movies. I found the 3rd episode in the Pirates trilogy to be very much like the first 2 episodes: boring. The same rehashed special effects and plot themes, as well as the same actors in ever more outlandish unrealistic and fantastic situations."
1,Doesn't Even Deserve One Star!,"This is by far the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Unlike the first two,there isn't even one single funny part. The story is so boring,I didn't think I would be able to stay awake until the ending, to turn the DVD player off! It was pure torture to get through.I wouldn't even accept this movie as a gift,and I would have to wonder what I ever did to anyone if they tried to foist this off on me! On top of the ridiculous,and continuous swinging about on ropes,as though they can get anywhere they choose by doing so,even in raging storms out at sea,you can only make out about every fourth or fifth word the character Calypso says,and she is a main character who has a lot to say!If you are desperate to throw away over 2 hours of your life,do yourself a favor and spend it sanding some drywall with an emery board,it would be less tortuous,and probably much more interesting!"
1,I Wasted My Time,"This is one of those movies where at the end of the film, they should have apologized for making us feel like we needed to see it for some sort of closure. I almost wish they had the nerve to just say ""This was awful"" and actually go back, change the script and make it worthy of what it should have been. Now with the fourth in the series coming out, it is hard to skip this film and jump to the fourth movie. I do have to say that some of the sets and special affects were pretty spectacular, but the awesomeness of that was clouded by such a horrible story-line. Like I said, I wouldn't waste my time with this one, but we all probably have to watch it in order to know what is happening in the next film."
1,LAME!,"This one was so bad it wasn't even entertaining. Didn't expect much, but the tacky marriage scene was beyond stupid. Then there is the process of getting to the movie on the disc. That stupid jolly roger kept recycleing through stupid cliche comments. Glad I only rented it vice buying this piece of trash."
2,"Too long, too many story lines","Just a lot of eye candy and no real substance. Way too many story lines. This movie just goes on and on. As much as I loved Johnny Depp's swagger in the last two, he just doesn't seem to bring the character to full boil in this one. Geoffrey Rush is the standout in this film. I look forward to a movie with Captain Barbossa as the central character. Also, the other reviews citing the darker nature of this film are right on the money. A kid's film it ain't."
1,What a Mess!,"I normally don't write reviews because I'm a firm believer in ""To each their own."" However, this movie is just a mess. I loved the 1st POC, love Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast is fine, but the plot/editing is dreadful. The 2nd movie wasn't as good, but I liked it. This movie is rarely as fun or funny as the 1st POC. It's really hard to believe that this movie did as well in the theatres as it did. Don't waste your money."
1,Pirates at Worlds End won't play,"When I insert the blu ray disk the trailers play, the advertisements plays, I select the language (English) and then the title menu plays and I select Play Movie. That is as far as it goes. The movie does not play and the title menu plays repeatedly. I have a Samsung LCD 1920 x 1080p capable TV, Samsung BD-P1200 with latest v2.0 firmware and I don't know what to do. Is the disk defective? I have no idea but it appears that nobody else is having this problem."
2,Dissapointing..Lost Its Spark,"This movie was a huge disappointment. There are so many bizarre, pointless tangents of the story line, I had no idea where it was going. It seems they have run out of story. Now its a hodge podge of little stories that never run together well.Captain Jack's part was not very entertaining. The movie focussed so much on Elizabeth, I became bored. Even Will had a limited role in this movie.I think they should have stopped at 2 movies. This one doesn't work."
1,Worst of the lot,"Mind you, I liked the first movie. The second one was ok.The third? Clearly this movie was made for money. The movie is about three hours too long. (Wait, you say, it's only three hours long to begin with!) Exactly my point, it is three hours too long. I guess if you enjoy watching special effect after special effect for 3 hours, this movie will fill the bill. After about 20 minutes, I wasn't following the ridiculous story line any more. I really didn't care. I actually did watch it to the end to humor my ten year old son--but that's what dads are for, right?"
1,Samsung Players,"I have a Samsung player and can't watch the movie. It freezes at the menu screen. It's very frustrating. I'm getting tired of the whole BlueRay, HDDVD battle. From here on out, I'm reading reviews of the discs beforehand to see if there are any firmware problems before I purchase discs. I didn't wait long enough to purchase an hd player. I bought the Samsung a few mos ago, just shortly before some of the major studios dropped BlueRay. It's my own fault."
4,Yo-Ho-Ho and a barrel of laughs,"Well, once again Johnny Depp has pulled off a comedy classic. With a few twists and turns, the deep laughs continue throughout the movie. A must see for anyone who enjoys laughing and a little romance."
3,Confusion,"This is another action series where if you did not see the first two films, you definitely will be confused by the story line. Even if you did see the first two films, the beginning leaves the viewers a bit confused. The action scenes are first-rate; however, it definitely was not as good as the first movie."
5,Pirates of the Carribean,"Jonney Depp is even better in this one then the last episode as are Kira Knightly and Orlando Bloom and cast. We have the fullfillment of the middle episode and it explains things more fully giving a good conclusion. The sea goddess used is exceptional and gives a good plot twist to the ""BAD GUYS."""
3,WAY TO LONG.,"This movie is way to long and goofy, If they cut a hour out and stayed with the story it would have been a good movie."
5,Pirates at their Best,"What a fitting ending to this trilogy! These pirates did more double-crossing than you could even imagine. Definitely a movie to hold your attention. Johnny Depp at his maddest, chasing crabs across the desert. Great fun."
3,Too over the top,"All of the pirates movies are enertaining, but it is clear, even by the middle of the second movie that Disney was just milking this cash cow until it rolled over dead. The third movie has excitement and humor, but the first and most obvious flaw is that is it VERY long. Second of all, they tried to fit too much into the movie. We have finding Jack Sparrow, reuniting Will and Elixabeth, Davey Jones' heart, the rich English guy searching for everyone, and the matter of the spirit of the sea. The viewer gets simply overwhlemed with storylines and half the time can't even realize their total confusion because the movie is constantly flashing grade A special effects and fight scenes. This movie is entertaining, but it is too long, and overdone. I enjoyed all three pirates movies, but the first is the only one I watch more than once."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean-At World's End (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Good end to the saga with the open end of more possible adventures with Jack Sparrow.The specials disc is great with a lot of extras any true fan will enjoy.
5,Great fun for many reasons!,This is by far the best of the 3 movies. It is also one of my now favorite movies of all time. The thing I love most is that Elizabeth Swann is the truest pirate of them all and she finally shows her true colors.While a lot of the movie was completely expected the acting was great and I was always delighted in the way the expected rolled into the unexpected.All I can say is they had better make a 4th movie to finish tying up all of the knots!
2,"Long, boring and convoluted","By the time the movie was in its last hour, did anybody want to still be watching it? It went on forever and was only mildly visually entertaining, the plot was too silly and convoluted to even attempt to follow."
5,Very entertaining,"We watched this as a family with the lights off, popcorn in hand and volume up! Fun movie for the whole family. Even thinking of purchasing this one!"
3,disappointed,"I LOVE the Pirates movies, but I was a little disappointed in the last movie...I still LOVE the cast and I would NOT have been so disappointed if there were not so many unnecessary deaths. If you've seen the movie, you know what I am talking about. Just really sad, anyway, there's my two cents."
3,I was expecting more on Tia Dalma.,"There was this hype in the film about her. When she's unleashed, she grows 30 ft. tall, breaks down into a million crabs, creates a storm, and is never seen again...Geez.The director could have had her heal Will, and have his dad become captain of the Dutchman. But no, seperating Will from his woman...Was just dumb. I'd have also liked interviews with the main actorsin the Bonus Features, a Blooper Reel ain't good enough."
5,Pirates 3 special edition rocks!,"This special 2-disc version of Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End is great for those Pirates fans out there. The first disc has the movie, which is exciting and fun to watch, and the second disc has the bonus features that Pirates fans would be interested in. Some of the bonus features this product lets you enjoy are bloopers, deleted scenes, and explanations about the plot and characters, as well as commentary about the making of the movie. I highly recommend this product!"
1,At Worlds End all right!,"After the first two movies I have to say, the third is an absolute let down. A great example of how a nice plot can be ruined by cunfusing humour with stupidity, getting too mushy and crossing the line of what's believable and what's not. I laughed a lot during the first two. Not this one. The romance was pushed too much. Having a female pirate captain was also pushed too hard as if they were trying to make a point. Getting married during a sword fight! WTF. That was both unbelievable and stupid (or unbelievably stupid) and not funny at all. Walt Disney came out of his shell for the first two but alas, retreated straight back into moralistic claptrap for the last one. Rent it, don't waste the money buying this. One star goes to the actors and special effects."
3,The Way I recieved It,"i Opened it up and it had a finger print on the disc, which it is supposed to be NEW. And The Protective sleeve was all messed up."
2,Worst Of The Three,"Too long, too boring, too much talking, too confusing, too much. The other two movies were pretty good (although way too long), but this was just not very good at all. Too little Jack, I guess. Very disappointed at the horrendous acting and beyond-cheesy dialogue. At least the special effects were cool since I didn't have a clue what was going on the whole movie."
2,Disneys boring new ride,I wanted to love this movie.It looks like a really staged production and it was bad.Even Johnny Depp couldnt save it.Dead Mans chest should've been the end.
2,Why are all the production companies cutting out....,"OK, I bought the first two episodes in the ongoing saga of Monsieur Jaques Sparrow and although I understand English they decided to leave off the French translation/subtitles on this DVD after having it on the first two (they did this again with the Spiderman Franchise movies) and it is REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! The movie production people need to keep consistent with their product. Not really happy as my kids speak French mostly and we watch these overseas in French West Africa...."
4,Great Disc even though the Movie's not the best in the series.,"Like most people I prefer the first two movies in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy to this one, but I really can't complain about the quality and features on the 2-disc set. Lots of great commentary, behind the scenes, etc. that all combine to make it a great addition to your collection."
1,One more time,"Product was perfect. The story is nonsensical and stupid. Keith Richards' appearance...big deal! Not even ""kid fun."" Wait to see it on cable."
2,Empty Treasure Chest,"Too bad the screenwriters ran out of energy and ideas because POTC is so original. I wished I had waited for the DVD to rent because my experience in the theater was not worth $9.50The Singapore scene was about 20 minutes that could've been shortened to 5 minutes and there was nothing of great significance besides the navigational maps.Jack's scene in the Doldrums was completely overlong. Again, the scene could've been shortened to about 5 minutes. And what's the point of Jack licking the rock? It's a dumb shock factor.Seriously, this movie would've been great if there was more willpower by the crew to cut scenes down and out because there's no reason for a movie to be 2 hrs and 45 minutes long. I was so disappointed (save for the battle scene in the end!). I'd just stick with the first two movies and pretend I never watched the third"
1,Pirates 3=Worst Movie of ALL TIME!,"After being truly engrossed by the first two Pirates movies I was all set for the third movie but I could never have anticipated the letdown. I was stunned at the utter lack of a story in this truly awful movie. The Pirate Lords???? Hallucinatory Jack seeing multple Jack Sparrows??? Swann as Pirate King???? Keith Richards never looked so uncool and silly. What trash. Don't listen to the people who start their reviews of this movie with ""I don't care what people say, I loved this movie"" It's a lie. Nobody could love this movie and I was a HUGE fan of the first 2. I have never got up and walked out of a movie but I never came closer than this garbage. I couldn't wait for it to be over it was so stupid. Not only will I not buy this DVD to complete the trilogy, but At World's End was so horrid it actually lowered my opinion of the first two. Stay away and hope Depp & Co. actually try with the next one."
2,confusing plot ***,confusing plot *** make at worlds end the weakest and most confusing of the series.
5,STAY TIL AFTER THE CREDITS,I dont want to give anything away but if you havent seen it or going to see it agian stay until after the credits are over. Something important happens!!
1,The Worst of the Three,"Of the three Pirates movies this one is the Worst! There was very little acting, the moments that made the first two funny and fun are totally gone and there is a total focus on big effects and grand spectacles.After giving it everything I had to just finish the thing I still can only guess at what it was about and why I wasted two hours of my life suffering through this stupid, stupid movie.Watch Pirates 2, take a guess at an ending, and save yourself 2 hours of pain watching Pirates 3."
5,great purchase,we ordered this movie for our daughter because it's her favorite. it was delivered very quickly and was less expensive then in any store we looked in.
3,C'mon Disney.....you can do better,"Im not sure about everyone else, but i found this movie to be the weakest out of the three Pirates films. I had seen the first two in the threatres before i bought them on DVD.....unfortunately for me i didnt see the 3rd one in threatres. I bought this movie mainly to complete the triolgy and because i figured it would be as good as the first two....sadly i was wrong. The story line is weak and the action is missing. I guess if i had to look on the bright side of things, i only paid $9.99 for a brand new copy.Only buy this if you are like me and want to have the complete collection. Otherwise, go buy the first two and pretend that there was never a 3rd one"
4,Excellent price! Fast and free shipment,"While not as good as the first (what sequals are?), at least I got it cheaper and sent directly to me without shipping costs."
4,Not as good as the first but still fun,I did enjoy this movie. This first was better but still a good time. I am a huge Depp fan too :)
3,A fun conclusion to the series,"The experience of watching this is completely entertaining, and you'll have a good time. Just don't be expecting a movie as good as the first in the trilogy - neither this one nor the second one can hold up.That being said, the visual effects are great, and Johnny Depp is hilarious as usual. Worth a watch if you want to find out how the story winds up."
4,"Good Movie, but poor quality recording","The movie iteself was very good and we liked the fact that we received both a DVD and Blueray version. However, our Blueray pixilated terribly about 2/3 of the way through our viewing. It eventually corrected our viewing and we were able to complete watching the movie without further interruption."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Nearly three hours of special effects occasionally leavened with character interaction and humor, At World's End tries valiantly to tie up the considerable number of loose ends left over from the first two installments; if you're a fan of the first two you'll see this just to finish the trilogy, but if you've got 3 hours lying around you can really do better."
4,Not as good as the first,I enjoyed the first movie the best. I have a theroy that the first title is a trilogy is the best the 2nd is ok and the third is either better or they should not have made it. In this case I enjoyed the first very much the 2nd had a lot of great things and the third let me down.
2,Confused!,Part one just blow me away! Part two had a alright plot/stroy but was more on special affects. Part three started out like you missed the first half of the movie and just gets more confusing as it goes. Their is no real plot/story and the special affects where not that special. This movie just looks like it was left open ended so they can come back and make more too tie up all the loose ends of this movie. Not worth watching until they come out with the other movie(s) to make sense of this mess!
4,Pirates III,"Not the typical ending we have come to expect, but an excellent way to end the trilogy nonetheless..."
1,warning:fails consumer reports test,"""Three seats failed all our tough tests: the Evenflo Discovery, the Graco SafeSeat, and the Britax Companion, formerly our top-rated seat based on earlier tests that mirrored the federal standard. Most other tested seats passed either the front- or side-crash test in some configuration, though only the Baby Trend Flex-Loc and the Graco SnugRide with EPS passed all our tests. (EPS stands for expanded polystyrene, a cushioning"" from consumer reports.We have owned this seat for 4 months and I am mortified at the breaking news of it's failing of these safety tests."
1,"Takes too long to get to the meat, cardboard cutout characte","I actually only read about the first half of this book, I got tired of waiting to get to the story. The back cover and fly leaf are misleading. The whole first half of the book are ""build-up"" to the story talked about on the fly leaf. Also, the author's writing style is rather obnoxious to deal with, and his characters are flat and predictable."
2,So so a few good ideas.,I thought this book was ok. It was a little boring and out dated. It didn't really have to grit of how to. Basically get a good clean act and take it to an agent and make lots of money. That is what the book says. I got a few ideas from it. There are better books on the business or magic. It is an ok book. It is not long so it is a quick read.
4,Please Please Me,"You must appreciate this album for what it is. It is basically live tracks (recorded in 12 hours) of songs played at Liverpool night clubs in early 1963. The Beatles were one of the first British rock groups to be a given a record, so they were obviously surperior to any of their competetors. No rock 'n' roll music in 1963 was any more complicated; that would only happen over the next couple of years when the Beatles took rock to its greatest heights. These were four kids (George Harrison was only 19)! For a band just starting out, this is a fine album. (And it keeps on getting better from here!)"
4,Good collection of early Beatles tunes!,"While mainly covers, it is still clear that from the three beatle-written songs on the album that they would become the greatest band of all time. And the covers are great too, although ""Boys"" really doesn't make sense because they started changing the genders in the lyrics. Still really good album, but go for the real classics first."
3,The Beatles' worst album...,"The only reason I bought this album was for Twist and Shout, which I should have just found it on Napster and burned it. This album was too fifties-ish for my taste. The Beatles' are my all-time favorite band, but I like their later work, such as Sgt. Pepper, The White Album, Abbey Road, and Let it Be. This early work wasn't all their own, but a good warm-up album for the rest."
3,my CD is missing a song,The song we most wanted is missing (AND I SAW HER STANDING THERE) only 2 seconds of the song. And we had opened the CD already. What now?? CD: PLEASE PLEASE ME (REMASTERED)
2,Early beatles,"I would like the words and music to ""Chains"" off the Please, Please Me..... album.. Thanks"
4,Good (at the time),"This is a good CD. It is by no means classic Beatles but it was what started their great careers. Listen to it and compare it to later CDs it is neat to see how they progress. However, if you don't have a Beatles CD don't buy it, buy ABBEY ROAD OR SGT. PEPPERS."
4,Please Please Me doesn't quite please me,"The 2009 stereo remaster is leaves me with mixed feelings. Some of the mixes are good, ""Ask Me Why"" comes to mind as does ""Twist And Shout"", but the new stereo mix of ""Please Please Me"" is not very good. It sounds tinny and a bit distorted. I wish they would have included the mono version instead. I'm lukewarm on ""I Saw Her Standing There."" It sounds a bit tinny to me as well."
4,great 1960's pop,"This is the Beatles debut album, it hints at what was to come. It's no Revolver or Addy Road, but a great listen never the less."
3,A Sonic Mixed Bag,"I have all but one of the remasters now. The truth is that the remastering works best on the later material. The first couple albums, especially Please Please Me, were recorded in mono and sound best left that way. I have a mono CD version of Please Please Me that was manufactured in West Germany. (I don't know if all of the ones we got here were made there). I made my own CD with the 2009 version cuts immediately followed in succession by their mono counterpart. The results in general were that the mono version works much better on rockers like 'I Saw Her Standing There', 'Please Please Me' and 'Twist and Shout'. There's more punch, and even though the bass thuds a little bit, it sounds appropriate. The 2009 Remaster comes off better on the ballads like 'Misery' and 'Anna'. There's some subtle instrumentation picked up that isn't there on the mono version. If I had to have one version, it would be the mono version because it feels more accurate to time and place."
5,Here is how it all began..,"The first Beatles album really give the birth to modern rock and roll. Four lads from Liverpool did really revolutionize the music forever. Their mop top hair style was really popular in early 60's. Their band formation was widely imitated by most of the band of the sixties. John Lennon and Paul McCartney teamed up to write most of the songs for this album. Before, the Beatles few of the performers wrote their own songs. Their harmony is simply beautiful. Their cover version of old favorite rock and roll and Motown is more vibrant and energetic than the original version."
3,The first (and best) boy band,"Please Please Me certainly ranks at the bottom of the ""Best Beatles Album"" list, but it's STILL better than %95 of the [stuff]played on MTV today. The sound quality is bad, and the lads haven't yet mastered their instruments, but they play with such ENTHUSIASM that you can't help but ignore its faults. It sounds like they were genuinely happy to be making an album. Could anyone, based on this album, guess what they'd become in just three short years?"
5,A FANTASTIC DEBUT BY THE EXCITING BEATLES!!,"PLEASE PLEASE ME IS ONE DYNAMIC ALBUM! THE BEATLES STILL SOUND AS FRESH IN 1999 AS THEY DID BACK IN 1963! I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO START COLLECTING MUSIC BY THIS ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME SUPERGROUP! I GIVE IT AN AAAAA+! I LOVED THE MUSIC! MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE ALL OF THEM AND A BAG OF CHIPS!"
3,Please Please remaster-me!,"What a crime against art. The music is great, the cover is great, but the digital production stinks. Shame on EMI and George Martin for settling for this kind of sound quality.01. I saw her standing there 10/1002. Misery 9/1003. Anna 7/1004. Chains 7/1005. Boys 8/1006. Ask me why 9/1007. Please, please me 10/1008. Love me do 10/1009. P.S. I love you 10/1010. Baby it's you 8/1011. Do you want to know a secret 10/1012. A taste of honey 9/1013. There's a place 9/1014. Twist and shout 10/10What an amazing feat to record your first album in twelve hours. Though to be honest four of the songs (Love me do, P.S. I love you, Please, please me & Ask me why) had already been recorded and released.This is obviously a 5 star album, but with such poor ""digital"" production it gets 1 star. So that looks like 3 stars."
2,what a tame album it is!,"The weak standard band's album was recorded in the beginning of 1963. This one is recorded in mono only not stereo!!!This early beatles's phase is absolutely tame. They covered many american rock n roll composers in that era. need I say more?Check out other better rock bands albums like deep purple live and studio albums, they are much much better than this one."
2,I'm bored,"the songs are typical beat music in the 60's, yes it was the time for beat music absolutely. each song has two or three chords to play like I saw her standing there, please please me, twist and shout etc....for beatles fans only!"
1,langweillig!,"oh cool! it was the beat music is the 60's, therefore they called them beatles.they wanted to be Elvis and copied mostly american rock n roll and rhythm and blues. Included The isle Brothers original song Twist and shout!"
1,WHY JOHN? WHY? WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS?,"I like The Beatles but I hate to say it this stuff completely SUCKS. Yes it's a classic and i'll give it that. BUT it's classic BOY BAND., I see no difference between this and BOY BANDS. except The Beatles played their own stuff. Skip this and go to HELP! or later stuff."
1,Good for a zoo,This is monkee music. Don't listen to it. The Beatles were only good after 1965 with HELP! and RUBBER SOUL. After that they had talent.
4,There You Go Again,"As Ronald Reagan said to Jimmy Carter, ""there you go again."" I'm referring to LKeeners continuing diatrabe against the Beatles. Now she's given her personal critique of ""Please Please Me,"" saying that songs like ""Twist and Shout,"" ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Please Please Me,"" ""Boys,"" and ""Thank You Girl"" lack passion. I read her bio and saw that she's a zit faced 18 year old kid who passionatly loves the Stones and hates the Beatles. She's too damn young to understand either of them."
4,A 1...2...3...4!,In 1963 the greatest band rock'n'roll ever produced released their first album Please Please Me. It's not their best album ( listen to Sgt.Pepper and the White Album) but it is a nice collection of rock'n'roll in its ealrlist form. I Saw Her Standing There is a fast upbeat rock type of song that is one of my favorites. Please Please Me is another good song and it is their first #1 hit in England. I'm 13 yrs old and it's still fun to listen to this CD when I was a growing 9 year old.
4,The Beatles First - A Must Have,"The Beatles first album boasts strong Lennon/McCartney tunes, such as its hit title track, ""Please, Please Me,"" as well as ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" and ""Love Me Do."" It also shows the Beatles' ability (and early tendency) to do covers such as ""Chains"" by Carole King and Gerry Goffen.The album was rush-released by EMI in 1963. In fact, the whole album was recorded in a famous one-day session. The final track recorded during this session was ""Twist and Shout,"" by Phil Medley and Bert Russell, a favorite Beatles cover from their Hamburg and Liverpool nightclub days. On this album, ""Twist and Shout"" was recorded in a single take with Lennon already suffering from a sore throat after eleven consecutive hours of recording. This apparent weakness actually helped enhance the edgy sound of Lennon's lead vocals on this track."
4,A band with promise.,"I got this album today and listened to it twice. I think it's a great album, but there's too many love songs. But, I shouldn't whine, because that's what was 'in' at the time. This is where it all began, my friend. The killer debut. Some songs good, some bad. I love ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""A Taste Of Honey,"" yet ""Chains"" and ""Anna"" are too boring. Yet, who could not love ""Twist and Shout""? I think George is the best player in the group. John's singing needs work, however. Good debut."
1,Honk if you hate the Beatles!,"Honk if you hate the Beatles!Honk if you hate the Beatles!Honk if you hate the Beatles!Please Please Me = Bad Bad musicSo dated are the Beatles, yuch!"
3,"eh, it's ok","The Beatles just starting out. Not great, not bad, but it still has the popular songs that everybody knows(love me do, please please me, etc.)"
3,Maybe It Will Please You,"Please Please Me is not a horrible album on any level. But compared to things to come, this is my least favorite. But It does have a few great songs.I Saw Her Standing There. Now there's a great song. Anyone will like this simple McCartney Rocker. The next best track is Please Please Me. Mostly Lennon singing, with Paul and George on backups. John really seems to take advantage of that harmonica on this album, most notably on Love Me Do, The Beatles first huge hit. Another bigger one, Twist and Shout. Here we have paul and george backing up John who's rippin' those vocal cords.Not the best Beatle album to start with, and not the best over all, but it is essential to any fan, and it isn't to bad for a first album."
3,Should be available in mono,"You can't make a real stereo version out of this, it was recorded on 2 track. Of course it sounds odd. They should have put the mono and stereo mixes on one CD. Add to that insult, the mono box set is now ""sold out""Also, everyone needs to listen to the Arthur Anderson version of Anna, it is pretty fantastic."
5,Please Please Me - in One Night?,"In the past I would've given this album 3 or 4 stars. Good (anything by the Beatles was good), but not one of my favorites.Then I read the e-book about the album by Alex Hendler, and it provided me with a whole new appreciation of this album. For example--* the Beatles recorded the album in a single day* because of musicians' union rules they had to work in 3-hour shifts* John was sick as a dog so they left Twist & Shout until the end. (Explains why the vocal is so raw - and incredible).* They recorded everything live. No multiple tracks like they do today. ""Boys"" they did in one take. That's Ringo playing drums and singing simultaneously, and they got it in one take.So, yes, 5 stars for an incredible performance under strenuous circumstances. I highly recommend checking out the e-book. They sell it on Amazon. It's a quick read, and will give you a better understanding of why this album is as good as it is.Please Please Me"
3,Not great.,I found this broom hard to use. I have hardwood floors and didn't think that it got the crumbs out of the creases in the floor.
2,Didn't work very well -- we gave ours away,"It was cute and seemed like a good idea, but didn't work very well. We ended up giving ours away."
4,BATTERY,LIION BATTERY FOR A PANSCONIC CAMERA. I HAVE USED THE CAMERA 3 TIMES SINCE ADDING THE NEW LIION BATTERY. SO FAR IT HAS WORKED VERY WELL. CHARGE IS HOLDING MUCH LONGER THEN ORIGNAL EQUIPMENT BATTERY.
2,"Good Songs, Lousy Sound","Every song on this CD is a winner. Unfortunately, the sound quality leaves something to be desired. Not all of the songs have a ""broken speaker"" sound to them in places (usually the louder notes), but enough do to make it irritating to listen to this set. Buy the 3 disc Chess box set instead. I checked it out of the local libary and listened to the same songs that sounded terrible on this ""Gold"" edition and they sounded fine on the Chess box set edition."
4,Great product.,Half the price of other USA made sockets and and only marginally more than the so called good Chinese and Taiwanese sockets.Finish is not as good as some more expensive sockets. SK Lifetime warranty Almost wonder if these sockets were factory blemishes that were sold to online wholesalers for lower cost. It doesn't matter to me i'm going to add my own scratches and other character marks with use. What ever the case these are great sockets. I'd Buy again
4,Good compromise.,"I was surprised with the discounts how good of a deal this is. Life time warranty, made in the U.S.A. and O.K. quality. I will not lie the more expensive brands are solid but these are a good compromise. Remember they have the S-K lifetime warranty so you have as good of a warranty as the more expensive ones."
1,IRRESPONSIBLE (too bad 0 stars is not a choice),"You should be aware that more responsible and compassionate practitioners have demonstrated in repeated studies that the dosage of CCNU that (Dr Olgivie)advocates in the treatment of even simple skin cancers is 100% fatal. Not only has he refused to examine this information, he continues to advocate this dangerous practice to less experienced vets who will needlessly take the lives of many more patience. Every step will be taken to see that this publication is removed from the shelves of responsible book sellers everywhere, and from a personal note, what liability can be attached to his actions for culpable negligence."
4,A historical review of technology's addictive hold on humans,"A great book to place 21st century technology into perspective. As an avid stone axe collector, I have long valued the place of these artifacts at the beginning of mankind's race to understand and dominate our planet. This text helps one to conceptualize technological advances; why they are adopted and addictive. Alas, the author's offering of a possible solution - an internet awareness push for all members of the globe, cannot occurr as long as the majority of humans lack adequate water and sanitation, let alone electricity and the internet. The solution for balanced development of our planet is large scale reduction in the numbers of humans, because humans will clearly always select more comfort enhancing, ecology-upsetting technology."
1,Urban rebounder cable flex with DVD,Not as pictured! I expected the entire product as pictured but received a DVD only that was not even the correct DVD ! Very disappointing!
2,Not What I Expected,"This DVD was pretty disappointing. The moves were not that great and the instructor got on my nerves so it was hard for me to get into the various workouts. I kept thinking if he says ""HANG IN THERE"" one more time I will HANG MYSELF! Hopefully this DVD will benefit someone else but it did absolutely nothing for me."
1,watch problem,I purchased this watch in April and have had to replace the crystal 3 times since. It seems to just shatter out of the blue without being impacted in any way. There definitely must be some sort of design flaw here!!
2,Unnecessary bulk added,"The original ""Treasury"" was a very helpful volume. But I would not recommended this ""New Treasury."" It is a very bulky volume that adds much unnecessary and unreliable information, such as theological notes from an Arminian perspective. The original Treasury just gives the cross-references without bias comments.If you want help with Bible study, get the original ""Treasury."" I used it extensively in developing my book ""Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible."" The cross-references in the original ""Treasury"" were a great aid in finding the thousands of verses I reference in my book."
5,Circle Play,"Great book love the way these circles go together, easy directions too. So simple & you can add circles at any stage of making your quilt."
4,A Sleeper of a book,"If you are into L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology Peter Moon gives you all you need to know in this book. 4/5 of this book is about L. Ron Hubbard & Scientology 1/5 of the book (the last few chapters) are about Noble Drew Ali & the Moorish Science movement. Peter Moon also makes people cognizant of the hereditary relationship between so called native North American ""INDIANS"" and Africans from West and Northwest Africa namely the ""Moors"". Traditional M.S.T. Temple members might find the information radical. But I find it compelling and it warrants further research."
4,an autobiography and a lot more,"An amazing book- this is mostly the author""s autobiography and spends a lot of its""s time when he is in the Sea Org during the seventies. He knew LRH personally and I regard it as an important historical document because of it. If you are pro or anti scientoloy or even if you""re just pro or anti Sea Org it""s a must read as it""s a work that most likely will never be repeated. The author isn""t the most intertaining writer I""ve read but it""s the information that""ll keep you hunting for more.- I know I will!!"
5,I found them!,I have had a very difficult time finding these belts for my electrolux vacuum. Thank goodness for online sales options!
1,Disappointing,"I have tested this product and have been disappointed.I applied it as recommended and after 6 months of use, I have not seen the smallest difference in hair growth.This said, it shapes the eyebraw rather well, and makes them look glossier.It exists with a mascara tip as well for eyelashes, and I have tried it with the same results. I do continue using it though, not for hair growth (I have found the right product for lash growth that I wear at night) but to protect my eyelashes from mascara. I have no proof that mascara may be damaging to the lashes (most of them have conditioners I beleive) but i have the feeling that used daily after many years it probably doesn't do them very much good... so protect them with one coat before applying my mascara now, just to be on the safe side."
1,Garbage,"I carried a D40 all over the world for eight months and 6000 exposures without so much as a scratch on the LCD. Then I stupidly shoved the camera into a laptop bag that also had my car keys in it. Result: a nasty gouge in the screen. Shortly afterward my flash quit working and I sent the camera to Nikon under warranty; they replaced the LCD cover at no charge (yea Nikon!).So...I thought I'd try a stick-on screen protector to guard against my next stupid move. Bad idea!These flimsy pieces of tape totally destroy the image quality of a good LCD; every shot looks like it was taken at IS0 3,000,000. Doesn't matter how carefully you apply, your screen will look terrible. What's the point of protecting a nice screen if the ""protection"" makes it into an awful screen?Pass. Bad product. I may try a real glass protector like the Giottos Aegis...or maybe I'll just go back to exercising reasonable caution."
1,Just threw them away,"Bought this product expecting those ""static cling"" screen protectors.Got it in the mail and found it to be the adhesive variety. No big deal.Cut it to size for my camera and laid it over it. Looked awful. Not only did it change the colors on my LCD screen, but it had so many swirls and weird ""ghosts"" that I just decided to try another piece.Cut it to size, put it on my screen and it was the exact same way.So even though I was very annoyed about the quality of the product, I chose to try it out and see if my mind changed. I left it on my camera, in my camera case for about 3 hours of walking around. When I took it out, the film had all but been destroyed. It was scratched and scuffed and would no longer adhere to the camera.Conclusion - Awful product."
4,Nice product if you are ready to do scissors-work,"I needed some screen protectors for myNokia N800 Internet Tablet PC, after browsing amazon for a while I decided to the test my luck with this one.Since it was cheap, I did not have much expectation. But it did the job well. The package comes with 6 large screen protectors, one cleaning kit and a part that will help you get rid of ""bubbles"". The protectors are adhesive, not static, but thats OK for this price.I would recommend this one, if you are ready to spend some time with scissors and getting rid of bubbles."
1,gps screen protector,"Digital Concepts LCD Screen Protectors for all GPS UnitsAfter following all instructions carefully, I found it impossible to get all the air bubbles out despite numerous attempts."
1,Universal Screen Protector - Usless,"The material is too thin. It doesn't adhere properly. When you slide your camera in it's case, the 'protector' starts coming off. I wish I had seen these reviews before I bought."
4,"Good moisturizing lipstick, WAY off color swatch","This lipstick feels like lip balm and has a mild minty flavor. I also like that the tube is compact, but the lipstick itself is full size. My only complain is that the color swatch is way off base. I bought this in Crush, which looks like a medium mauve in catalog photo. The actual color is a much paler, more like a dusty pink and happens to be the exact same color as my natural lip color. (Don't even get me started on the swatch. You might as well buy a random shade and hope you like it.) So, other than feeling like I paid $6 for a lip balm, I love it!"
5,The Listening Tree,"The Listening Treeby Joyce Ann EdmondsonThe Listening Tree is a delightful glimpse into a woman's life as she discovers her faith in God. From childhood, she unknowingly takes the hand of God and is led spiritually on her life's path. As a girl she searches until as a young woman she finds her place in God's plan-not as a Nun, as she wants, but as a wife, mother and grandmother devoted to her family, and a woman who shares God's love with others.I find the Listening Tree to have a calming effect upon the reader. Reliving the memories of this author's lifetime and how each cherished memory brings her to be the loving woman God always knew she would be, instills in the heart of each reader that God is there waiting to take their hand, and as the listening tree, God will hear those who pray.Nancy Lee ShraderIS IT NOW? The End of Days!"
2,Size,"I normally wear a XXL T shirt, Dress shirt, causals etc. Your XXL was more like a L/XL here. I believe you have to make some suggestions on sizes in your website. We here in the Mid-West are a bit bigger than most of the people there in Hawaii. Just a thought."
3,"Pretty and well made, but nonstandard sizing.","For these shirts in Large (I bought four different ones), the measurement around the chest is about 5-6"" smaller than a typical Large shirt, even though the shoulder width is typical. I recommend getting a shirt at least one size larger than normal if you want to be able to move easily."
3,Nice - but small,"Like has been said . . . they are nice, but you'll probably want to order two sizes above your usual. Good thing I didn't by an ""extra large""! I will order again IF they come out with XXXL."
4,Party Item,Well i final got the item. I will have a great time on saturday at the Hawaiian party now...Item is great and will buy more in time...
2,Self Published Turgud prose & Tortured syntax,In Writing Popular Fiction Loren Estleman warns book buyers to beware of self-published authors. This is an example of why.The author restates the familiar using an idiosyncratic vocabulary that adds nothing. Since you cannot access the contents on Amazon you won't know how little you're buying until you spend $30.Their are occassional tid bits of interest(hence the two stars) but IMO it's not worth wading through circa 300 pages of obfuscation to find them.
1,"author dislikes elitists, yet is an elitist himself","Good grief, this fellow is bitter against ""literary fiction."" And yet his condescending tone makes you feel as though he's talking down to you, just like the academics and NY editors he complains about...Writing the Breakout Novel by Donald Maas is much more helpful AND fun to read!"
5,A Roadmap for Writers,"Advanced Writing:Fiction and Film, by Wells Earl Draughon, is a virtual roadmap for conceptualizing and formulating a successful novel or screenplay. It would be an excellent choice for classroom use as a textbook for college-level writing courses. It is a detailed instruction manual for the advanced student, and serves also as an indispensable guideline for critiquing rough drafts and works in progress. The author has obviously made an exhaustive study of hundreds of novels and films. He uses his expertise to make countless comparisons of good vs. bad and strong vs. weak novels and screenplays, in order to help the writer avoid the kind of mistakes and pitfalls which can keep a story from achieving its full potential as a popular and financial success. Film producers would do well to study this book. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in creating a well-crafted novel or screenplay."
2,reviews are inaccurate,The box says 225 but there were only 196. I bought this because of the other reviewers on Amazon.com. His extra bio balls must have been from my box because mine was short. These bio balls are tiny. I don't this this it worth $15 (which is what I paid). I put them in a gallon container and had plenty of space left over.
2,this could be better,"I am a beatles fan but this is my least faviorte album. two much filler and instrumental stuff. The title track all together now, and only a northern song are good. Haybulldog would be better on the white album taking the place of either your blues and revolution 9. GodBless"
4,Listen for the Voice,"On ""All You Need is Love"" you'll hear a voice just after the cellos/violins start playing in the right channel.I know of one other place a voice can be heard. See if you can find this in other songs from the remaster series."
2,minor to mediocre,"A cute enough flick, but not much of an album, certainly not by Beatles standards. ""Hey Bulldog"" is the most interesting of the few new songs. The original l.p offered the first true stereo rendering of ""All You Need is Love"", but that no longer applies. And, George Martin, a true genuius of a producer, possessed little talent as a film score composer. Apart from the lovely ""Pepperland"", there's not much worth listening to in his contributions here. All in all, a pretty much expendable novelty from the Beatles catalogue. For completists only!"
2,Three words: out of print!,"Overall, tracks 2-5 do their best to make up for this album, which is sadly still in print. The only four new tracks that the Beatles are on should be saved, unlike the classical tracks which few of us listen to.A good album if you like the Beatles and/or classical music."
2,For the Completist Only,"This is the worst Beatles album, and it is really the only example of the band not giving their fans their money's worth. Half of this album consists of cotton-candy orchestrations by George Martin, and no serious music fan can call it good material with any conscience whatsover.The originals here are few and of mixed quality. The skinny is that if you are a Beatles completist, as I am, you will want to own this album for 'Hey Bulldog,' 'All Together Now' and 'It's All Too Much.' Otherwise save your money."
3,George Martin's Dreamy Score,"Give Sir George Martin credit for the second part of this CD (side two of the vinyl album). The dreamy soundtrack perfectly captures the mood of the movie, and is pleasant to listen to on any day of the week.As for the first part, it is a rehash of some lesser Beatle tunes from 1967-1968, the best being the heretofore unreleased Hey Bulldog. Therefore, the album only rates 3 stars in the opinion of this reviewer."
3,bad soundtrack,"But ""It's All Too Much"" is awesome ! The rest,well... ""Hey Bulldog"" is very good too.For completists mostly."
4,"All You Need Is Love,And this CD",I can't say that this is the best Beatles album that I have heard.But I can say that it is worth the money buy the album and enjoy!
3,"If you're looking for Beatle music, not a lot here","If you're after Beatle songs, this is definitely NOT the album to start with. There are only four Beatles songs that don't appear on other albums (""Yellow Submarine"" and ""All You Need Is Love"" were borrowed from other LPs), although two of the original songs (""Hey Bulldog"" and ""All Together Now"") are really great. The other two are interesting for their production values, although lyrically ""Only a Northern Song"" doesn't really go anywhere.The bulk of the album is given over to George Martin's film score, which is enjoyable if you take it on its own terms. If you're a first-time Beatle buyer, get a few other albums under your belt before you come back to this one."
4,Yellow Submarine MOVIE,"Okay, I must admit although I thought I knew what I was purchasing, I was disappointed at first with the CD in the reality that it didn't have all the songs from the movies. But after listening too it, I am glad I purchased it and have come to appreciate and enjoy the instrumentals. This is a George Martin project more than the Beatles....but that ain't bad."
3,"Buy it for ""It's All Too Much"" or if you're a completist","I am a Beatles completist, and so there was never any doubt in my mind that this CD would eventually become part of my collection. I probably would have bought it anyway, since it is the only place ""It's All Too Much"" appears on CD. (Too bad the extended version from the movie doesn't appear as a bonus track!) But if you've never heard of that song and if you're not a completist, this album is entirely skippable. George Martin's instrumentals, while pleasant enough, are by no means essential, and the only new Beatles songs on this album beside ""It's All Too Much"" are ""Hey Bulldog"", ""It's All Too Much"" and ""Only A Northern Song"". This hardly even qualifies as a real Beatles album."
3,Beatles?,This is the album that was used to fill the gap between MMT and the White Album. This album actually came out in 68 not 69. It's not too good. It's ok.
5,"Great Album, those 4 new ones are really great","im a huge fan of the new tracks we see, and once you watch the movie, it all pieces together to be a great album,so i suggest, to buy both this and the movie together"
2,Don't waste your money on the music CD,"If you are truly a completist...get the movie on DVD or VHS.Like most other movie sountracks,this one is just a marketing ploy.You will not regret getting the real thing.It's still great thirty years later.By the way,little kids just LOVE the cartoon!!!"
3,Japanese sub-titles,"Don't know how this happened; downloaded all 16 re-mastered discs, to ITunes.The only one with Japanese song titles, was Yellow Submarine; how bizarre; wtf?Anyway, I changed all the titles to English; duh!Anyone else have the same scenario?"
2,Shoulda been an LP padded out w/singles like MMT.,"""Hey Jude"",""Revolution"",""The Inner Light"",""Lady Madonna"" and the forthcoming ""Don't Let Me Down"" could have taken up the space on this album instead of George Martin's score.That should have been a separate album.Oh well,it wasn't so there.Not essential by a longshot."
2,The Beatles out to steal our money.,"A typical soundtrackalbum hence that the music is depended on the film. Only four new beatlestracks, with Lennons ""Hey Bulldog"" as the classic, which would have formed a strong EP. This album feels like an unnecessery rip-off."
2,Big no-no,"The Beatles material here is generally good, particularlly Hey Bulldog, It's All Too Much and Only a Northern Song. But the instrumentals are pretty bad, and I don't wanna see the movie. Overall, not all that good."
2,Don't buy it,It's more of a fantasy music CD for kids. It's not that great. Only 2 of the songs are worth listening to. Get the White Album or Rubber Soul instead.
3,An EP would have been fine,"The 1969 album ""Yellow Submarine"" could have been an EP (extended play record). Just take out the seven George Martin tracks, which leaves you with six, all of which are Beatles. An EP has four songs on it, right? So, just take out ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""All You Need is Love,"" BOTH of them are on previous albums ""Revolver"" and ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" and BOTH are already released as singles, so we shouldn't waste space with them.This leaves you with 4 songs, ""All Together Now,"" ""Hey Bulldog"" ""Only a Northern Song"" and ""It's All Too Much."" This album could easily have been just an EP and not even an album, ""Only a Northern Song"" and ""All Together Now"" on Side-1 and ""Hey Bulldog"" and ""It's All Too Much"" on Side-2.Simple as that.Not too good.Although it is much better than the 1999 Reissued album, with all that horrible remixing they did."
3,YELLOW SUBMARINE---I THINK IT HAS A LEAK,"This is just not a good album by the Beatles. It is worth listening to it once or twice but only if you check it out at the library<DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY>. There is only 4 new tracks on this album ones that r not very inpressive. NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR THE HIGH BEATLES STANDARD.Thank You"
3,fab four fan,This was all right. I was expecting more Beatles and less orchestra. There are some neat sound effects like in a submarine. I would not recommend it if you just want to hear the Beatles.
4,All too much indeed,"This is, after all, The Beatles we're talking about. The George Martin filler is no more intrusive (at least it's organized separately) than the filler in the US (United Artists) soundtrack from ""A Hard Day's Night,"" and as background soundtrack stuff Martin's work is better than most.On the merits, the then-new material in this collection still rocks 30 years later; I still get a rush from the opening of ""It's All Too Much,"" and ""Hey Bulldog"" is alone worth the price of admission with its jaw-dropping guitar solo - how many musicians wish they could pull off something like this at all, much less in passing? ""All Together Now"" may be a bit of a knockoff, but McCartney's knockoffs often outshine many composers' entire career efforts.Five stars? Naah - as a package it's a substandard effort for these guys. But the very existence of the standard set by The Beatles' career puts their lightest efforts far above (and beyond) most artists' best."
3,The 1999 Remaster is better,"I blind 'ear tested' the cuts between the 1999 Remaster of Yellow Submarine and the 2009 version. The 1999 version is better, more powerful, more presence."
4,Beware of Russian pirate CDs,Nice addition to any collection but like most Beatles Mini-LPs (as at mid 2009) this replica is made in Russia and is not an authorised release. It is effectively a fake. The estates (etc) of the artist get no royalties. Anything with this type of obi (black Japanese look-a-like with the two s's) falls into this category.
4,"Yes, your blueness!!","""Yellow Submarine"" remains one of my all-time favorite animated films. The soundtrack is rather inconsistent, unfortunately. The instrumentals, which serve as ""background"" music (e.g., ""Pepperland Laid Waste"" are reasonably good, but far from spectacular. That said ... the Beatles' tunes are remarkably good. The title track, featuring Ringo Starr on vocals, is a great romp (and I think it's an outstanding kids' song). My favorite song on the album is ""Hey Bulldog,"" and it was a real treat to see that footage added back into the movie. I'm also quite fond of ""All Together Now,"" which plays during the movie's closing credits. An important piece for Beatles fans, but not the best example for a ""newbie"" to the group's milieu."
2,Capitol Does It Again!,4 new Beatles songs. Rest consists of George Martin instrumentals or rereleases. Capitol is again guilty of shortchanging Beatles fans.
2,why did i buy this cd?,"they only reason whey i own this CD is that i own all the other albums from Help (don't bother too much about the albums prior to that). i agree with the other ppl below who suggested the same. ""Hey Bulldog"" is an excellent song- but thats it! but if u r a beatles fan like i am... u have to buy it for completeness."
3,Only An Average Album,"Yellow Submarine is far and away the worst album in The Beatles' catalog. It is almost unfair to classify it as a Beatles album as it contains only four new songs, two previously released singles and alot of songs that comprise George Martin's score. The new songs are often overlooked, but are still great. ""Hey Bulldog"" is a something of a rarity, a forgotten Beatles classic. ""Only A Northern Song"" is a great George Harrison song while ""All Together Now"" is an absolutely irresistible Paul McCartney singalong, which is an ode to the music sung throughout the UK in pubs. Unfortunately the tepid and weak score drag down the rest of the record."
2,The Beatles worst album,"I normally woudn't give a Beatles album less then 4 stars but this album is really a rip off. I really cant see people giving this 5 stars unless your a classical music fan. There's only 6 Beatles songs on this 2 of them are from Revolver and Magical Mystery Tour. That leaves you with 4 new Beatles songs and you know what the songs aren't that bad. Hey Bulldog is the best out of the new songs. George's songs It's Only A Northern Song and It's All Too Much are cool and very pschyedelic. All Together Now is good but lyrically stupid, I love it. Side Two is just boring elevator music. I cant Reccommend this, but I do reccomend The Yellow Submarine songtrack."
5,Buy this now !,If you don't have this (all) the Beatles remastered cd's. buy them as soon as you can. The sound is the best you will ever hear. I'm a musician and i can hear the hands sliding on the guitars. It's like you are there watching them create these masterpieces.
3,TOO SPARSE,THERE ARE ONLY 4 NEW BEATLES TRACKS ON THIS LP.LENNONS HEY BULLDOG ROCKS HARD GREAT BASSLINE HERE.ITS ALL TOO MUCH AND ONLY I NORTHERN SONG ARE TWO HARRISON TRIPS INTO PSYCHADELIA WHICH ARE OKAY BUT PALE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ONE OF HIS ON SGT PEPPERS.MCCARTNEYS ALL TOGETHER NOW IS SIMPLE BUT A RARE TRACK.THESE 4 TRACKS ARE OKAY BUT NOT NEAR THEIR BEST WORK AND GEORGE MARTINS ORCHESTRA MUSIC ON B SIDE IS MOST FORGETTABLE.
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY...,"This CD is nothing to write home to mother about. It contains six Beatles songs, two of which appear on other CDs. The four new songs are ok and not reflective of their talents. The remaining tracks are orchestral drek by Sir George Martin. All in all this is a poor sample of The Beatles. Save your money. The Beatles have some great CDs. This is not one of them."
2,FOR COMPLETISTS ONLY......,"I'l be brief....Just go and get the ""Yellow Submarine Songtrack"" from 1999. A vastly better value and listening experience. It contains the band tracks from this CD plus lots of other tracks from the Fabs' psychedelic era. The tracks were superbly remixed and remastered at Abbey Road in 1998. These give the mind a glimpse of what the Beatles catalog might sound like remastered."
2,"A great movie, but not a good album","Most of the songs of this album are not so good for the Beatles standards, and a half of the album is pure soundtrack... surely the worst Beatles album ever."
3,Not the best of The Beatles,"The ""Yellow Submarine"" Beatles album is not the best. It has two fillers, ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""All You Need is Love."" I call them fillers because they were on previous albums and shows that The Beatles had to throw in oldies to fill up the album. In short, The Beatles did very little with this album. All they did was write and record four songs. That's it. The four songs being ""Only a Northern Song"", ""All Together Now"", ""Hey Bulldog"" and ""It's All Too Much."" Side 2 of the album is beautiful orchestral music and I love it, but it's not The Beatles. The Beatles didn't re-record the fillers, so that makes them even less active in this album.Although it is nice for what it is, this album has very little Beatles. I would choose ""Abbey Road"" or even ""Help!"" over this one."
2,"OK, no more.","I've bought all sorts of boat handling books and videos, always looking for some kernal of wisdom or some new trick. This video is pretty much like everything else in this genre: maybe helpful to the rank beginner but little more. If you're thinking about moving to a twin engine boat, this might be a good introduction but is best rented or bought on sale. Really, books and videos about boat handling are mostly an illusion; there really is no substitute for direct instruction from an experienced captain and practice, practice, practice. A book or a video is at most helpful for learning the vocabulary and getting some sense of the issues; it won't teach you to handle a boat with a lot of windage, with a crosswind, in a narrow slip, with an engine out or sputtering, and with a wife or SO freaking out. Only practice will do that and with that last one, even practice doesn't help much."
3,Tracklisting,1. For a Long Time After (5:08)2. Dizzin' (5:20)3. Zoology (6:37)4. Spur (5:24)5. Inner Flight (12:22)6. Le Modele Aux Trois Visages (3:53)7. Turn the Key In the Lock (Remix) (8:55)
4,Excellent text and photos in this brief book,"I agree with the previous reviewers: I carried this book to the Galapagos and found it a super companion. It isn't comprehensive -- and a few additional pages of IDs and photos might be desirable -- but it covers all of the essential natural-history topics: geology/volcanoes, history, fish, birds, mammals, turtles & iguanas, geography and so on -- and the photos and text are excellent. Indeed, the text is what sets it apart; there are short, interesting discussions of many of the features that are exceptional to the islands, so without any deep study you come away with some appreciation of what you have seen. Finally, in addition to the good chapters mentioned by other reviewers, there is an excellent chapter for planning your trip, which details what you will see where. It is amazing that so much good stuff was fit into this thin book. Take it with a more comprehensive treatment if you want the name of everything you see (or ask your guide)."
3,Galapagos Wildlife,Used this book to keep track of where I went on my trip. Gives a good summary of the different landing spots and what to look for in each place. If you are visiting the Galapagos Island take this book with you.
4,Great guidebook for the non-naturalist,"I looked at several books on Galapagos wildlife before deciding to purchase this one. I found this guidebook to provide just the right level of detail and description regarding the wildlife, with nice pictures as well."
5,My first and last,"I started playing guitar about 4 years ago and this was my first amp. I still have it to this day and still using it. The distortion is very noisy but if you get a pedal you won't have any issues. For a studio/practice amp, this is a GREAT bang for your buck. Never had an issue with it and it is still going. My best investment yet."
3,decent but one could do better,"When I first put this dvd in the machine I was shocked to hear Country Rock music being played as the sound track. I was immediately discouraged about what I had just bought. The people dancing to the music were't particularly inspiring either. You wouldn't watch them dancing and say ""wow! I would love to dance like them!"" The dance instructor wore his best pair of jeans for the occasion. In other words the video is extremely square and low budget and I'm not sure these people have ever actually heard swing music.On the other hand, the steps are presented well enough and if you have some good swing music to dance to and make an effort not to be as stiff and square as everyone in the video you can learn some moves and get some basic dance steps under your feet."
2,Kinda looks like it's made by a high school journalism class...,"I really hate to say it, but I just can't get past the bad production quality. It was obviously filmed in the 80's, and like someone already mentioned what is on the cover is NOT AT ALL indicative of the video itself. It uses cheesy graphics, bad in-camera effects, and sometimes cuts edits while they guy is still talking. It's so dated that in places it is downright comical, even accounting for the fact that it was shot 20ish years ago.As for the instructors themselves, they seem to know their stuff and are pretty good at explaining things. However they have absolutely no energy so the whole thing just drags.This may be an okay video for some people since it does explain things very simplistically, but if your looking for something with energy and entertainment value I think I would find another video..."
3,Introduction to Swing,Several styles of Swing dance including East Coast and West Coast. Great introduction steps to those dances
4,Just what I was looking for,My girlfriend was trying to find this in the stores...so I decided to get it for her for Christmas...bonus points for this bf
5,"Beatles ""HELP""","If you're a Beatles fan, still, then you'll truely enjoy this item. The sound quality and re-mastered recording is well done."
5,A great one: HELP!,"How John Lennon's confessional song became the title for a silly James Bond spoof I really don't know. The funny thing is, it works both ways--as a young man's personal statement about learning to open up to others, and as the frantic theme for an exotic espionage chase comedy starring those lovable mop- tops (this time in COLOR). Like A Hard Day's Night, only the first ""side"" of this album actually contains songs from the movie--the biggest hits being the eponymous cry for assistance and ""Ticket to Ride."" But part two has a few nice tunes as well, like ""It's Only Love,"" ""I've Just Seen a Face,"" and a little ditty called ""Yesterday."" And I always love it when they do an all-out screamer like ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy,"" which sounds like John's raucous answer to Paul's ""Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey"" vocal on Beatles for Sale. Of course, it's essential--as are all the Beatles' soundtracks (all the Beatles' albums), with the possible exception of Yellow Submarine."
5,A perfect transitional piece,"This was an important transitional work from mop-tops to a more intraspective and innovative period. The one thing that stands out for me on this album was the R&B-influenced delivery of a line and then the repeated line in harmony, for example: ""You're gonna lose that girl"" (yes, yes, you're going to lose that girl) or ""We said our goodbye's the night before"" (the night before). That particular vocal style is present throughout the album and less so in later records. It's most effectively presented, however, in the very great title song. Which will always be, the purest of Beatle songs for me."
3,A Mediocre Collection Of Songs- For Beatles Fanatics Only,"There is a strong tendency among reviewers to praise everything that the Beatles have released to the skies. As someone who likes some of their stuff, but who is NOT of the opinion that they were the greatest band ever I have to say that a casual Beatles listener can easily do without this album. There is only one really great song here (Yesterday). Songs like ""Help"", ""The Night Before"" or ""Ticket To Ride"" show some potential, but are not really great. Just decent little ditties. The rest of the material is pretty weak, especially ""You Like Me Too Much"" and the closer ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"". Another thing that I (I confess to being a lover of a crisp crystal-clear sound) am a little bothered about is the primitive sound, but as far as this goes, it is due to the technical equipment available at the time. The Beatles are not to blame for this."
1,Help! The Beatles,This CD has half the songs from the original album. It includes songs from several other Beatles records. Shame on me for not reading the fine print.
1,Product misrepresentation by Amazon and Vendor,"All the CD's I ordered, did not indicate that they are South American originated copies - Brazil and Argentina. The nation of origin of the product should be listed. I still am not certain that they aren't pirate copies, and the vendor Innuendo still has not sent a return call tag. I would recommend using another service."
2,The second star is for persistance,"While not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow, this is another terrible effort by the so-called fab four. Yesterday is instantly forgettable, Dizzy Miss Lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50's and Ticket to Ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly. As usual, I did enjoy Ringo's excellent drumming and I liked the song Act Naturally. For shame!"
2,Longing for the original movie soundtrack,"As for the music it is great music like all of the Beatles songs but back in the time when this music was released Help was a soundtrack to the movie without the added additional tracks which replaced all the George Martin Orchestra and other orchestra tracks. It was a true movie soundtrack. This is what I want to hear. I can't believe after 45 years of putting out Remastered music this wasn't on anyones minds. I guess they may be waiting for us old timers, who be the only ones to recognize it to die off and sell it for some new lost music to a new group of listeners.Disappointed."
4,Help! Not Needed.,Good Album (C.D.). I got it for some of the songs on it that are good tunes. Not crazy for the movie though.
4,EC in Nashville,"4 out of 5 because you need to have it. I wish that it was the original movie score. Who needs the extra tracks, ie Dizzy Miss Lissie. This belongs on earlier Beatles' stuff. Little Richards was not a direct influence on this era. I miss the goofy brass band instrumentals that were a part of my ""stamp"" on this album, and this era of their art."
5,Ageless.,"Did these guys ever record a bad album? Nah! From the confessional tone of the title track, with some of Ringo's best drumming, to the Dylanesque acoustic ballad ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away"" (love that 12-string and flute coda!) the Beatles began exploring a softer, more acoustic vibe on this 1965 classic. All the tracks are originals and George even begins to stretch his songwriting and vocal muscles with the lovely ""I Need You"". As always, the true pop-meister of the group, Paul immortalizes his gift with the timeless ""Yesterday"" and there's really nothing more to say about the impact and popularity of this song. You'd be hard pressed to find a bad song here or on ANY Beatles album, so if you've never listened to them, or you're looking to expand your music library, ""HELP"" is perfect place to start."
4,Great,"There are some great songs on here. The first side is the best. The second side has some great songs, but some are rather anemic. YESTERDAY, while a great composition, for my money is not a great recording. I figured out why when I saw a video of the Beatles doing YESTERDAY at Shea Stadium. And I really liked their live rendition of it better than the studio version, which surprised me, because I don't consider the Beatles a great LIVE band. But it dawned on me that the reason I liked the Beates doing YESTERDAY live was that it was the BEATLES doing the song. The studio version is just Paul McCartney without the Beatles. And so the chemistry isn't there to make it a great recording, even though it is a great composition. So YESTERDAY, DIZZIE MISS LIZZIE, TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE, and I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE keep side two from being a great side. But the other songs on this album make it an album well worth buying."
5,My all time favorite album,"I have been listening to the songs on Help! since 1966 and I still listen to them pretty often, especially now that our kids are Beatle fans, and we just love them ! We also don't get tired of watching the movie (even after seeing it over 150 times ...). Songs like Help!, The night before, Another girl, You're gonna lose that girl and Ticket to ride are in my top 25 Beatle songs. Consider this album as a long term investment that will keep you singing along for years."
1,What am I missing here??,"I have looked at two pages here side by side and I can't for the life of me figure out why this version of 'Help' put out by Toshiba EMI in 2004 is priced at $41.49, while what looks to be the exact same CD put out by Capitol in 1990 is priced at a much more reasonable $13.49.Unless you can find something I am missing, I'd suggest you head over tohttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002UAL/ref=m_art_li_59/102-3455281-6122531?v=glance&s;=musicand buy that one."
4,Classic,"Help, Yesterday, Ticket to ride all topped the charts. The reason this is my fifth favirote album and 4 stars is Yes it is which is a wonderful Lennon Ballad would have been great to close the album instead of Dizzy miss lizzy. GodBless"
3,Not the best.,"Though there are some good tracks on this album there is just too much glorified filler. There are several Beatle's classics, like ""Help!"", ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away"",""Ticket To Ride"",and ""Yesterday"" and a few good album tracks like ""Another Girl"",""You're Going to Lose That Girl"". The rest is just some unnerving album dross that is really a dissappointment.No it isn't their worst album, but it isn't their best. The filler sucks but the rest of the songs make this album mostly worthwhile."
3,BUBBLE GUM POP,"BEATLES was one of the first ""project"" bands ever, like MENUDO, SPICE GIRLS, BACKSTREET BOYS, etc. With one big difference: they had McCartney, Lennon and Harrison aboard !!! True great pop musicians. I love this album, but the trouble are the lyrics. Of coourse in that time rock and pop didn't talk about society problems, inner thoughts, depression, violence, etc. ""love"" and its related problems were the common theme. But the lyrics in this album are so cheesy I almost can't bear it at all!!"
2,Slight improvement,"I bought the remasters of ""Help"" and ""Rubber Soul."" Great albums, but the lopsided stereo is annoying. The liner notes say, in very small print, they worked from the 1987 remaster. No wonder the sound improvement is only slight."
5,The Beatles don't need help. they rock.,"the beatles are by far the best group of all time. i'm not the only person who thinks that. i haven't heard all of their songs, but Help! is one of their best that i've heard and it's on this CD. i guess they are like the rolling stones, so if you like them get it. and yes, if you listen to ringo starr or john lennon they were in this group when they were REALLY good. it is oldies music, but it will be good forever."
4,An Improvement,"The compositions were continuously improving for the Beatles, and Help! contains many highlights. The songs from the film may be slightly better, as Lennon continued to show improvement in his lyrics with the title track, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, and Ticket to Ride, the latter of which had an excellent arrangement by the band, and fine guitar playing. McCartney had highlights as well with the rocking the Night Before, the bluegrass I've Just Seen a Face, and the classic Yesterday. Harrison's compositions were not yet at the level of Lennon and McCartney, but they were the match of other British contemporaries. The country styled Act Naturally, sung by Ringo, was also another highlight. The album ends with a raw and uncompromising screaming rendition of Dizzy Miss Lizzie sung by Lennon. This album was a very strong early effort, and goes down as strongly recommended."
3,Heavily Hyped,"There aren't significant differences between this recording and the original. True, you can hear the bass line a little better here, Lennon's harmony there, but unless you're a Beatles junkie it's not worth the price. The ""re-master"" is just the producer's opinion of how the songs could be better. The originals are great enough, this isn't an improvement."
3,Help! is just an holding operation.,"There is definitely way too much writing on auto-pilot on Help! Of course, there is a couple of great songs like ""Help!"", ""Ticket To Ride"", ""Yesterday"" and also some nice ones like ""I've Just Seen A Face"" or ""Another Girl"" but that's not enough to make Help! such a good buy. Some songs on it are definitely fillers like the two George Harrison songs(""I Need You"" and ""You Like Me Too Much""), ""Tell Me What You See"" and ""Act Naturally"".If you want to start a Beatles collection, you should buy Rubber Soul(1965) first then Revolver(1966), Sgt Pepper's(1967), Magical Mystery Tour(1967), The White Album(1968) and finally Abbey Road(1969). Then you can always check out the other albums if you become a big fan. If you want to get a great album from the period pre-Rubber Soul, I suggest you With The Beatles(1964).I think Help! is the second ""weakest"" Beatles album after Beatles For Sale(1964). But Help! is really not all that bad, it's a Beatles album after all..."
5,HELP ! The Beatles [ UK ] CD,Love the music. Listen to this one a lot. Highly recommend this CD to any Beatles fan. Thanks.
4,They're almost there....,"With Help!, the Beatles were almost at the level of greatness which they got closer to on Rubber Soul and finally reached on Revolver. Help! is the beginning of their evolution from pop stars to great musicians. It contains both lovey-dovey pop (The Night Before, I Need You, It's Only Love) and wonderful, more mature songwriting (Help!, You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, Yesterday). Help! is sort of a crossroads which had the Beatles moving on to bigger and better things. Get the later albums first, but buy this one if for nothing more than tracks 1, 3, 7, 12, 13 and 14."
3,Biding Time,"I'm not one of those Beatles fans that fails to see the forrest for the trees. In fact, even though I'm a fan, I pride myself on being pretty objective when critiquing the Fabs.Help was a holding pattern for the boys. You can tell that they're trying to dodge the ""boy meets girl"" theme that was evident in their early work, but they can't quite get there. Still, ""Ticket To Ride"" is a great song, ""Yesterday,"" though I'm personally sick of it, is a standard in the category of ""Stardust,"" and ""Help"" is one of the first introspective Lennon greats.The fellows hadn't discovered the evil weed yet. It was to make a profound difference in their music.Who in 1965 would have known what was coming next."
4,A great early Beatles album,"The Beatles' music had been increasingly getting more interesting in 1965. Help is filled with catchy songs but is far different from any other early Beatles album. The last two tracks, ""Yesterday"" and ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" exhibit the band's full virtuosity. With ""Yesterday,"" they prove they can make music beautiful and use sorrowful lyrics. (They'd tried before, but never had made a song like ""Yesterday""). On ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy,"" the Beatles stay true to their Chuck Berry/Little Richard-like roots and play a riff that will be stuck in your head for hours.As a whole, Help isn't that much different from A Hard Day's Night or Beatles for Sale, but it's the best example of the Beatles early pop stuff and a perfect album for Rubber Soul to follow."
5,The end of an era... the start of a new one.,"This is the last album of what I consider the ""early"" Beatles; the band that was mainly concerned with love and its varied forms. The anguished ""Help starts off the mix, and it's probably the closest tune to the transition that was made with RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER. The rest of the album continues with the usual Beatles mix. It is wonderful collection of songs that deal with love; its joys and consequences. ""You've got to Hide Your Love Away"" is a truly beautiful tune with Lennon's pain clearly heard in his vocals. Harrison's ""I Need You"" follows right behind with its plaintive lyrics; HELP really is an emotional collection (By the time you get to ""Yesterday"" you realize ""regret"" is the theme to this recording. Excepting Ringo's performance on ""Act Naturally"" which seems to be out of place, (I love Ringo, but this one just doesn't fit.) and the unnecessary cover of ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" this one's nearly perfect."
4,Good for the Ears,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable and classic Beatles album...soundtrack...from start to finish; opening with a jangly bang a la ""Help!"" and ending with an all-out rock & roll buzz (""Dizzy Miss Lizzy""). It still sticks with their catchy pop tunes earlier in the decade but makes way for their more experimental sounds to come - it's a bit of a blend if you will. My personal favorite attribute of this album is that it is pretty short making the ""listening experience"" quick and fun. I would have given this album 5 stars, but when I think of 5 star Beatles albums something along the lines of Sgt. Pepper comes to mind. Help! however, is definitely worth having and listening to as are all the Beatles albums."
5,THE EARLY DAYS CAME TO AN END,"The early days came to an end with this album that will feature for the last time two songs not written by the guys:ACT NATURALLY and DIZZIE MISS LIZZIE.The influence of DYLAN will show clearly in RUBBER SOUL.The three great songs here are of course the title track,TICKET TO RIDE and YESTERDAY.But the whole album is fun and has become quite nostalgic.Those vocal harmonies in YOU'RE GONNA LOOSE THAT GIRL and ANOTHER GIRL will be out of fashion by the end of that year.From now on, THE BEATLES will be more concious in their songwriting ,and it will help them reach their peak in the next years.For those who don't know it, HELP parallels JOHN'S nervous breakdown after all the pressures he had as a BEATLE."
3,okay acceptable!,"Help was recorded & filmed in 1965 the glorious day of beatlemania in that periode. The album is okay but the film acting is terrible.the songs are acceptable here, a bit better than Beatles for sale, with the beatles or please please me."
2,"Remixed, the original Parlophone LP is better","I am only giving it 2 stars because this is the CD version I am reviewing. As an album it is 4 stars. The CD version is remixed, it sounds different than the LP. The LP is what the Beatles intended and several songs have variations, for example ""The Night Before"" has a louder keyboard on the LP and mixed down on the CD, and kind of muffled. Also ""Help!"" is different on the mono 45, the vocals are different. Until they rerelease the LP mix on CD, that remains the definitive version. The CD version is inferior. Try to get the LP if you can and notice the difference!"
3,help! is in between also,I like the song called Help! by The Beatles. That is also one of the songs that I know the best. E-mail me at thebeatlesfantanya@yahoo.com
3,A Book For Serious Actors,"Firstly, if you are not truly devoted to acting, you will not find this book all that interesting. But if you are a Method devotee, then you will find much info & interesting anecdotes here."
5,"A somewhat dated reprint , but still excellent!","This is a case where the title pretty much says it all. This is a reprint of Henry C. King's classic , originally published in 1955.The time span covers pretty much the beginnings of visual astronomy through the Mount Palomar 200"" Hale telescope. A particularly interesting era is the 18th century , with many notable advances made in glass manufacture and beginning of very large reflecting telescopes in the hands of Sir William Herschel. As the author moves into the 19th century , the names of Joseph Fraunhofer and Alvan Clark take center stage.The invention of many other auxilliary astronomical instruments are also included in this fine work.There aren't many other works for comparison , so --- 5 stars!"
3,The least of the Galidor Line,"The Galidor line by Lego has been a huge success with my son. He loves to change the parts in and out and modify the characters. The Eggcraft is the weakest item in the Galidor lineup, but all Galidor toys are a worthy purchase at the current prices you can find them.The problem with this particular toy is that the detachable legs (which swap out with the character's legs) do not hold the Eggcraft up very well, and my 5 year old has abandoned trying to make it balance on the legs. This does not keep him from playing with it, but he plays with the characters far more than the ship.Durability? It's Lego, and we have had great success with the durability of Lego toys. No problems with this toy on durability, but my kids are pretty careful with their toys.As mentioned before, my least favorite in the Galidor lineup, but my son likes the novelty of an egg shaped spaceship. At the current discounted prices an overall good purchase."
4,Galidor TDN Module,"I was looking for this specific toy, because Grandma did the unforgivable (when cleaning out a closet)--gave the previous one away!!! VERY unhappy 5-year old! Grandma glad to find this one to replace it!! Good, prompt service; good quality product. Happy grandson!!!"
4,Galidors are great,Although this is the weakest item in the product line it is still fun to use with the rest of the Galidor line. It is relatively bulky. Get the whole product line for maximum fun with multiple kits making for more fun.
2,HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!,"FIVE WORDS: The Grand Vizier's Garden PartyStonehenge, where the demons dwellWhere the banshees live and they do live wellStonehengeWhere a man is a man and the children dance tothe pipes of panStonehengeTis a magic place where the moon doth riseWith a dragon's faceStonehengeWhere the virgins lieAnd the prayer of devils fill the midnight skyAnd you my love, won't you take my handWe'll go back in time to that mystic landWhere the dew drops cry and the cats meowI will take you thereI will show you how"
2,Pink Floyd's worst album by far,"This is a review for the studio potion of the album, not the live portion.I've always been a Pink Floyd fan. I've listened to all of their albums from Piper to the Division Bell and liked most of every one.That being said, this is the last album of theirs I decided to check out. Mostly because of Gilmour himself saying it is a horrible album(although he did say the same about Atom Heart Mother which is one of my favorites).A lot of it is mostly psychedelic noise. While I am a fan of psychedelic music it's just not done really well here. I'd say the only tracks on it worth listening to are Gilmour's part of it(The Narrow Way). I enjoyed that part but that's about it. I really do not understand why it is reviewed so highly here, it is not well done at all. It sounds as if they attempted an epic sound but failed miserably.Unless you're a big Pink Floyd fan I don't recommend getting this album. It has it's good parts, but it is just overall a poorly put together album."
2,Not ready for Prime Time Pink Floyd,"I would have to classify myself as a big Pink Floyd fan...thy have produced many classic rock songs that cannot be matched....but this album all feels like a not ready for prime time Floyd. The first disc is not bad but just too much indulgence by the band without going anywhere. Now the second disc....I am almost insulted by it. You know how when you go into a modern art museum and look at something and think ""my 3 year old could have done that""....except for Granchester Meadows most of the second disc falls in this category...random noise. The only way you could possible like this stuff is if you are either very high on LSD or fooling yourself by saying to yourself ""wow man that Pink Floyd is so far out!"""
5,Live is mind blowing,"If you are interested in this album on the least it probably means that you have heard plenty of Floyd already. This is not a starter kind of album. The studio portion is weird and experimental and just a blast to listen to. Not to mention that crazy song that's title is a whole story unto itself. The animals, the cave, the grooving and the pict.As for the Live half. It is just far and away the better CD of this set. I listen to this as much as I do Dark Side of the Moon. It is very good. You get to hear another perspective of the Syd Barrett song Astronomy Domine. And a live version of Careful with that Axe Eugene. Aw you know what all 4 tracks are just flat out awesome! Get it if you liked Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Meddle, Saucerful of Secrets, or More. It follows a similar flow and sound, that sound being of the best (ish) band ever."
3,Music for eternity.,"I wanted ""several species of small fury animals"" to be played at my funeral. I wanted a cd player put inside my coffin and plugged in with an extension chord with ""several species"" playing in the repeat mode. I wanted it to play on repeat for all eternity. Then I came down off the acid."
5,One of the most fascinating albums ever!,"Ummagumma is one of the most enchanting albums I have ever heard! It is indeed not a conventional album, it is not mainstream (which is why it will not appeal to many) - it is a unique artistic experiment whose ultimate end result is an unparalleled magical atmosphere. I find Ummagumma is an expression of the deeper, darker, more primitive areas of the human soul. It is an album enshrouded in darkness and mystery, in which chaos and confusion, anguish and fear, are occasionally quelled by glimpses of harmony, serenity, light, and hope (Sysyphus being a great example here). To me, it is an album that expresses a deep, indefinable, secret, ancient longing of the soul to break free from the bonds of oppressive darkness and confusion that surrounds it. It is an album best perceived with the soul and not simply heard with the ears; it is an album in which I feel one should look for states of the mind rather than for conventional music as such."
4,"One part Yin, one part Yang, all Floyd","Of this double CD/Album, disk one is a live recording of classic Floyd which every Floyd enthusiast MUST have. The quality is outstanding. If the roar of the crowd had not been included at the end of each set you could swear it had been recorded in the studio.Disk two IS a studio recording. Each of the four members of the band (David Gilmour now replacing Syd Barrett who simply stopped showing up to play at live events) created a song of their own. Did it work? Possibly not, but each creation has it's own feel. Very interresting stuff."
4,Strange music indeed!,"One of Pink Floyd's strangest yet interesting works to date. ""Several species of Small Furry Animals Grooving In A Cave With A Pict"" is a cool song though :)"
3,"Decent Live Album, Terrible Studio Album","If this were released as a live album only, it would rank much higher in the Pink Floyd catalogue. But since it's attached to what is (arguably) the worst Pink Floyd studio album, it sits on the bottom of my list.As a collector of numerous PF bootlegs, there are far superior live versions of the songs presented here. ""Live at the Electric Factory"" and ""Interstellar Encore"" are two good examples of the same material being performed. ""A Saucerful of Secrets"" for example, is truncated to only 12 minutes on ""UmmaGumma"", but the typical length on most bootlegs is 20 minutes. Had Pink Floyd just released a double album of live material, then we would have really had something here.The studio album isn't a total disaster, though. ""Granchester Meadows"" is a nice little acoustic Roger Waters ballad, and ""The Narrow Way"" has some good moments. Unfortunately, the rest is practically unlistenable."
4,Wow!,I have just become interested in Pink Floyd. I am young and don't feel like following the hip hop and crap (rap) route. Having bought the wall and A Momentary Lapse of Reason I decided to take a chance. I asked the guy at the record store for some suggestions and I bought UMMAGUMMA. I popped it in my cd player and heard the speakers blurt out a sound so incoherent and chaotic. I loved it!
3,Wanna get it,"3 1/2For second-level Floyd, this is as good as it gets, with a memorably (despite a few weaker ideas) experimental studio disc supplemented by a mini-concert displaying the group at their psychedelic peak."
4,"BRILLIANT LIVE SIDES, NOT SO STUDIO","Am adding my 2cents on word of Wright's death...his keyboards and effects are a highlight of the ""live"" sides and these are the versions of these 4 pieces that blow away the studio versions: louder, more intense and spookier by far, they epitomize late '60s psychedelic rock. For me, these are timeless and I'll be listening to them (usually on 'phones) 'til I can't hear anymore. R.I.P., Rick (BTW, skip the ""studio"" sides; they're self-indulgent, boring and a bad harbinger of excess to come). One of the great album covers of all time too (loses a lot on a small CD case, tho)."
3,received as advertised,We like most of the Pink Floyd but this one was not as good as the others we have received. But the product was received quickly and it was new so it was advertised correctly.
1,Avoid. Fail. Worst Floyd.,"I have every other Floyd except for Atom Heart Mother, and this is the only one that truly sucks. One disc is studio & the other is live. The studio has almost nothing you'd call music. There's just noises & faint drums on occasion with something that's supposed to be musical now & then.The second disc is definitely music, but it's live stuff from the previous albums that you can just barely tell is live. So you might as well listen to the studio stuff.I've tried eight times to be open-minded about this album, but it doesn't matter. I've put this on as background while I'm cleaning up around the house, & I never hear anything interesting.It's hard for me to believe that this was allowed to be released. Please buy used only."
1,Two disc 1s = no fun,"Got this for Christmas 2008, to round out my Pink Floyd collection. It's a remastered and repackaged version of Ummagumma, cool beans. Well, now it's early April, 2009, just getting around to listening to it (I'm tired from being ""blessed"" with twin 2 year old boys). I decide to throw in disc 2, which has a lot of songs I haven't heard in forever, but I start hearing Astronomy Domine, which is supposed to be on disc 1. No prob--I probably put the wrong disc back in the jewel case after I opened it after Christmas to check it out. So I grab the disc 1 jewel case, open it, and there's disc 1. I look at what's supposed to be disc 2, and it's also disc 1. Great. Wife is pretty sure she got it for me from Amazon. I'll have to look at the return policy, but I'm thinking it's probably too late to return it. I think this is the reason why this product is discontinued--nobody gets disc 2. I really hate to give the Floyd a 1 star rating, but I gotta in this case."
1,is this really considered music???,"The live cd is ok, BUT the studio album is so god-awful that I can't even describe it. THIS IS NOT MUSIC. Where are the ""vocals"" in this cd anyway? I love Pink Floyd but I have to make an exception for this terrible album. Do no buy this album if you are just getting into Pink Floyd, or if you are a die hard fan. Either way you will hate it. If i could rate it 0 stars i would."
1,MORE PRETENSIOUS DRUG MUSIC,"Why can't musicians just give up this artsy fartsy garbage and get back to making music that matters. While admittedly these guys bring some rock to the table on the live disc, most of it devolves into a psychadelic mess and they don't realy guitar solo very often. The studio disc is where they loose their audience completely. Plus there's not a single song about hot girls. If you can't make a ROCK album that ROCKS then stay the hell home you wankers. Not recommended for fans who like to ROCK. Buy some oldschool Bon Jovi instead."
1,It's a collection of noise,"I'm a fan of Pink Floyd and have been for many years. I own all the albums and I have all the live CD's as well. Try as I might, I cannot listen to Disc 2 of this CD. Remastered or not, its just a collection of noises. This is one CD that won't go back onto my CD player"
2,Ummagumma,"This is coming from a petit bourgeouise(and proud of it) reviewer. This seems to be a psychleediddleedelic effort. I know great things were to follow such as ""Dark Side of The Moon"" and ""The Wall"".This seems to be experimental. The album cover was interesting."
3,"Cool, but others much better","I like it but others better. I would buy another album like it its better then nothing, but other Pink Floyd albums are kindof beter to me"
3,Needed more focus group input before releasing,"I Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun and regrettably found this album lacking. How could any self-respecting record company release this: there are no good looking women in the band and I'd hazard to guess that these guys can't even dance. Would be better if they stayed within the 3- minute format and had catchier hooks. Lyrical content might be made to include references to branded goods (i.e. Gucci, Lexus, Crystal champagne) thereby creating the potential for better promotional activities."
4,Only for hardcore Floyd fans...,"If you're a hardcore Pink Floyd fan, and you enjoy some of their earlier recordings, then this is a must-have album if only for this one song: ""Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict:""Yes, that's the title. It's something you have to hear to believe. I used to play it during Halloween to scare children.The other reviews will go into depth regarding the rest, and who wrote what. Suffice to say, if you're a fan of The Wall but think earlier Floyd - especially pre-Darkside recordings - are just ""okay"" then this is NOT the album for you.However, if you are like me and think that just about everything the Floyd has done after The Wall is mediocre, and that the early stuff is awesome, then you will like this album. It's offbeat, weird, jarring, and experimental, just like the times in which it was recorded. If you'll notice, a lot of the movies made during that time period are the same."
4,Now This Is Just One Man's Opinion...,"...but here's what I'd do. Toss out the live disc & when you go to work tomorrow, play the Furry Animals Gooving With A Pict ""song"" for one of your co-workers who's really into, oh I don't know, Keith Sweat or Celine Dion or something. Go ahead, be brave!"
3,Ummagumma,"I remember when I purchased Pink Floyd's Ummagumma on vinyl. It was very disappointing. The album sleeves caught my attention. I also thought that I was getting a real good deal because you were getting an extra LP an no extra cost. I liked the infinity concept in the front and a display of musical instruments in the back of the sleeve. It reminded me of a jet fighter displaying its armenments. It looked like they were a very talented band. The kettle drums really stand out. I like quality music and as I mentioned, it was very disappointing. I hated it! However, the more I listened to it, the more I liked it! Grantchester Meadows is my favorite track on the album and perhaps my favorite Pink Floyd track. Dave Gilmour's Narrow Way is not bad but Part II is disasterous. Rick Write's Sysphus is not bad in the beginning however he gets bored and just hammers out any note. The live album is o.k."
4,strange stuff but notable for the live material,"the studio album is just too strange to mention. nick masons compositions are especially senseless, but richard wright showcases his skill as a keyboradist, roger waters writes a strange number, probably the weirdest song ive ever heard in my life, but grantchester meadows is okay. the narrow way is the best 'suite' here. now on to the live stuff, which is the real gold. pink floyds first live album represents their live sound very well. all these versions kick ... any other versions of these songs found anywhere (astronomy domine is a good spacey rocker, careful with that axe is the best version ive found, saucerful of secrets, the live at pompeii one is too noisy, and set the controls, is probably the only one that i would say the best version of it is the one roger waters does on in the flesh: live, with this one at a close second.) buy it for the live material, and the cool poster it brings."
2,Self-Indulgence at it's worst,"I love Pink Floyd, don't get me wrong, but the studio CD is garbage. With the possible exception of two tracks this isn't worth buying.While the studio CD is self-indulgent experimentation without any musical direction, the live CD is a vast improvement. However, as it only has four tracks this should only really be purchased if you want to own every Floyd release. Otherwise these CD's will not be enjoyed."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Ummagumma is a two part album. The first half, a set of new studio recordings, is among the oddest recordings Pink Floyd have ever done. The second half, their first live release, is magnificent. It gets points for the great live material. The studio stuff is forgettable."
5,too expensive,"But the original recording is allegedly a soundtrack to Kubrick's ""The Dawn of Man"" segment in ""2001: A Space Oddysey"". Note how the song titles correspond to the film."
4,better listen to the live stuff,"too strange...highly experimental, only the live stuff is truly necesarry. and it brings a cool poster."
5,Exciting Album,"first of all, the live CD is great. It consists of great early-Floyd-tracks.then to the best part: Studio CDpowerful ""Sysyphus"" has scorching sound and very radical progressing, as the music fades out and then just blows again(first time I heard it I almost got a heart attack).""Grantchester Meadows"" is a beautiful acoustic track with nice background sounds""Several Species..."" is probably weirdest Floyd track, but it's a pleasure to ears""The Narrow Way"" is great Gilmour track, but only negative thing about it is that vocals could be clearer.""The Grand Vizier's Garden Party"" is also weird, coloured with stereo effects and opened/closed with flute solo.This is an Floyd album I'd recommend to everyone."
5,Great mount for TJ/LJ!,"I have this substantial piece of steel mounted to my factory LJ front bumper to hold a Smittybuilt XRC8. YES, you can use this mount for a variety of different winches (not just superwinches). Anything with the standard bolt pattern should attach with no issues. Highly recommended and looks great!"
2,Good Hiking Info - Poorly Laid Out,Maps are poor and hard to read. The graphic design of the book leaves a lot to be desired. Book is hard to read if your eyesight is going. Directions to trail heads are poor. Book is poorly written. Would be nice if color was incorporated. This is the only book for hiking Vail so incentive to upgrade is low. I am veteran of many hikes in the Vail area.
3,Good information but...,"I have read and enjoyed several of Mr. Toland's works. This one however is a very mixed bag in my estimation.On the good side is that he has a great deal of information from the Japanese side. On the bad side is that he displays amazing acrobatic ability to bend over backwards to place blame on the US and not on Japan for the war. He puts down information that places the blame on certain Japanese and then turns around and tells us that reason why the Japanese actions are America's fault!Anyone who reads of how the other Asian people that Japan ""liberated"" were treated can see very clearly the kind of ""liberation"" that was actually intended by those in control. Japan wanted to toss out the Western Imperialist and replace them with Japanese imperialism.This is amazing in an otherwise competent writer. I can only posit that he was blinded by the many fine Japanese he came in contact with including his wife. It is apparent that he was in no way unbiased in this case."
4,reveals new stuff,"Withholding one star because the book is so darn long. This book reveals history I never heard.Japanese knew that war with China, let alone USA, would be disastrous. But social & political dynamics swept Japan along to total disaster.I recommend this book but, if you can, try skimming because it often spends too many pages on insignificant details."
3,"Unfortunately, an early edition of revisionist history.","While I enjoyed Toland's other works, this piece all but excuses Japan's actions leading up to and during WWII, basically strongly implying that Japan had little to do with starting the war in the Pacific, and only a few hotheads in the Army were at fault (the same excuse was tried to excuse Nazi Germany's actions; an interesting coincedence).Worth a read, but only if one keeps the bias in mind."
4,"Simply outstanding, non-biased opinion by one of America's great historians (like Harry E. Barnes)!","John Toland's book aren't quite straightHistorical Revisionism, but there closeenough for me! Outstanding behind-the-scenes look at the Japanese militaryfrom non-Propaganda 'New Deal' (crap)position. Also check out Toland's Hit-ler (Schicklegrubr) book as well, an-other good read. Not afraid to look intoSchicklegrubr's jewish background, whichfor the brainwashed is a taboo [see alsoin that regard: Hitler's jewish Soldiers,a good but flawed book by jewish Amer-I-can Bryan Mark Rigg]. Mr. Toland died atage 90 several years ago but his appear-ances on Tom Valentine's great 'RadioFree America' show and various Insti-tute for Historical Review tapes, videos,at, al, are highly recommended. Best wishesto his surviving wife, Toshika!"
3,Frustratingly apologetic!,"I used to have high respect for Toland for being an author of various books on World war II but this book give me a second thought about his objectivity as a writer.Quoting from almost exclusively Japanese sources,he seems to neglect the fact that even today after more than sixty years,the japanese,notably their alledgedly democratic and peace loving leaders, remain stubbornly refused to acknowledged that they committed anything wrong in invading their asian neighbors,massacres of their inhabitants,stealing and ransacking their properties,raping their women and other atrocities.Toland's apologetic attitude toward the Japs is alarming aside from being disgusting.However his attempts to present history from the point of view of a criminal is something quite new but I found it worth reading, just to learn another lesson of man inhumanity to mankind."
1,misrepresented book,Received hard cover copy not paper back as advertised also only volume 1 of a 2 volume set worthless to me already have volume one.Not a happy camper would have given 1/2 star if I could
5,Timeless Garden Classic...,"I have used this book for years as my gardening bible. I have an edition with a foreward signed by James Bush-Brown and Louise Bush-Brown in Ambler Pennsylvania, September 1957. I'm glad to see the book has been updated, but what amazes me is that the older version is still so useful. Just this morning I looked up 'Hyssop' because I planted one in the back of my herb bed. The entry read, ""P; 18-24"" Seed: medicine, perfume, food -- Sunny; ordinary garden soil, not too rich. Prefers lime."" This entry (in Chapter IX, The Herb Garden) told me the plant was a pernnial, would not overshadow my other plants, and would grow well in my herb garden which is laced with lime.This book is succinct, useful, and too heavy to carry to bed for nighttime reading."
5,Knife drawer tray,I like having all my knife's organized in one drawer and off the counter. This product does just that.
4,Perfect solution,Fits my drawer with room to spare. Gets the knife block off the counter top. I would recommend to anyone looking to store lots of knives out of sight.
3,Doesn't work very well in shallow drawers,"The bolts holding these pieces of wood together on the underside are very thick. Sturdy! The drawback is that it raises the knives, and the angle of the wood that is supposed to cradle the knives makes them stick up a lot. I have 3.5-4"" deep drawers and bought this to fit 3 cutco kitchen knives, 4 generic kitchen knives that came with my old knife block, as well as a set of small steak knives to fit in the upper slots.The 3 cutco kitchen knives fit. All the others, no. The combination of the bolts and the angles of the wood did weird things with the other knives so that the handles stuck up too much to close the drawer. Even the little steak knives!So.... nice construction, very sturdy, but you might not want to buy it if the handles of your knives are not puny and/or do not have drawers AT LEAST 4"" deep."
3,Poorly described,"It just came. It seems like a fine knife tray but it doesn't fit in my drawer and I took careful measurements. My drawer is 17"" deep (description here says it needs to be 16 3/4"") and yet the tray doesn't fit in the drawer. This is a bummer - I think it's hard to return things to Amazon. They need to revise their specs because I have a hassle on my hands instead of a new knife tray."
5,A wonderful product!,I wish all of my drawers looked as great as my knife drawer does now! It really is a beautifully designed and finished way to organize and protect your knives AND fingers!
4,Satisfied Customer,"I purchased this product because I couldn't drill a magnetic knife rack into my stone tile backsplash in my new kitchen, and I didn't want a large knife block taking up space on my countertop. Overall, I'm very satisfied. I have a number of different knives, various sizes and styles, and I'm able to keep them all in this tray nicely. However, I will point out two minor frustrations. One, the slots for the knives are relatively close together. So if you have a knife with a larger handle it can be difficult to grab it or the neighboring knives. Secondly, larger knives (e.g. a butcher's knife) will stand tall in the tray because the blade is tall. Therefore larger knives may not sit snugly in a slot. Very minor issues indeed. Overall, it's a great option for storing your knives neatly and safely."
5,Excellent Product,Organizer was well finished and a great design for holding the maximum number of knives in the minimum space. It's nice not to see the knife block on the counter any more.
2,"Looks nice, but it has some major design flaws.","Although it states it is an 11 slot knife tray, in reality it holds 14 knifes plus a sharpening steel.My first impression from the picture was positive. A closer look when I received the item showed that on the bigger knife section, the edge of the knife is sitting on metal rods that are covered in rubber. In the one that I received the rubber did not completely covered some of the metal rods which left the blades of some of the bigger knifes exposed to the metal rods. I will still be concerned if the metal rods were completely covered with the rubber since with some use the rubber will wear out and the edge of the knife will be in contact with the metal rods which will deteriorate the edge of the knife.I will have to look for another tray to store my knifes."
4,Wusthof Knife Tray,"Although my Wusthof set of knives came with a knife-block, I wanted the ability to keep this fine set of cutlery in a drawer instead of on the counter top taking up my space. This tray fits the purpose to a ""T"". It easily holds my entire 11 piece set of knives plus the sharpening tool. The only piece it won't hold are the poltry scissors, which I just place in a tray next to it. It is not a big deal to me that the scissors won't fit. I was a little afraid that children could get ahold of the knives if left in the block. Being concealed in a drawer is ""Out of sight, out of mind"". The tray fit in a basic drawer and the knife blades are protected and secure. It was well worth getting. And yes, I would buy it again."
2,"Disappointed, poorly finished","Beware. This item is made in China, and the quality is seriously lacking. The one I received had rough, uneven sanding, no sanding in the knife slots. Gouge marks, and even splinters. Wood filler used in places and not even smoothed. Uneven spacing between knife slots. Sloppy brand mark. I would send it back, but don't want to pay the shipping. Over-all I expected much more for the price."
3,This book is out of date. There is a new therapy-Vagus nerve stimulation,"This book is well written, it is now completely out of date in terms of new treatments. There is newly FDA approved treatment called vagus nerve stimulation, a ninety minute out patient procedure. I would recommend the book ""Out of the Black Hole: The Patient's Guide to Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Depression."" It is a quick read, timely, very informative and the therapy is safe and unrelated to brain surgery or shock treatments.The author had the treatment and it apparently cured his depression. And he's got a great sense of humor about a very sad subject."
3,What exactly is she trying to tell us?,"Okay. I did not like this book. I am a suicide survivor of 2 years. I am also bipolar. I did not benefit in the least from this book. Meaning, as a survivor, it did nothing to help or comfort me. The author does offer some interesting notes. I just don't get this book. It just seems like the author is trying to fill up pages. She repeats herself so many times. What is the deal with discussing lithium for about ten pages? I mean, does this offer comfort to survivors? I don't think so. The book is just not down to earth."
2,"Informative, but overlong","KRJ has the credentials, the knowledge, and the skill to produce an excellent book about mental health issues, and she has done so in the past. ""Night Falls Fast"" is not quite as good as previous efforts, but still worthwhile. It is informative, and offers the average person a real understanding of the phenomenon of suicide-- who's most likely to attempt and who to succeed, what their motivations are, how to prevent them, etc.The book is not without flaws, however: she repeats herself in a few places, and the organization isn't really good. In one or two places she actually contradicts herself, or fails to resolve conflicts between advocacy for the bereaved and the prevention waves of suicide.Overall, a reasonably good book that could have used a better editor."
5,A great book,"In addition to useful medical information, the book provides an enthralling review of some of history's most artistic and innovative individuals who were afflicted by depression. It is told with compassion, intelligence and great insight."
5,An Unquiet Mind,"Absolutely brilliant. Dr Jamison gives an intimate and personal expression of her struggle without the reservations and jargon that frequently water down the absolute devastion that manic depressive illness can wreak upon your life and family, friends and professional colleagues.It is moving, thought provoking and provides hope for people afflicted with this disability. It also clearly articulates that manic depressive illness needs not be a barrier to career development and professional success. Dr Jamison gives many examples of the clarity of thought and ingenuity that the periods of mania can produce and the positive effects that occur as a result."
5,A Masterpiece,"Since I was 8, I have struggled with the demon of suicide. Dr. Jamison's book tells about the chemistry and the illness that causes one to think about it. It is wonderfully explained and touches the heart. She also explain the unpredictability of suicide and that mental illnes left untreated can have disastrous consequences. I firmly belive that if she did not go through the demon herself, she would not be able to understand the depth of despair that on goes through during a manic crash or a severe major depressive episode."
4,"Suicide, no morphine available for this pain.","Dr. Jamison has more words to describe the pain of depression than I thought available in the English Language. To give words to express the abject misery that a suicidal person feels is a gift. This alone makes this book worth buying. Dr. Jamison is both a psychologist and a literary persona. A unique blend of science and art make this book novel but a difficult first read. You will no doubt have certain expectations when you first read this book, and like me, you may be at first confused by the blend of scientific and literary style, but read it again for the unique perspective and you may have many, ah, ha! moments. Dr. Jamison is a courageous and intelligent person and no doubt at her own attempt at departure from this world God said, ""not yet, there is more for you to do"". I hope to read more of Dr. Jamision's books."
5,An excellent book -- Esp if you are troubled with suicide,"I found this book while reading Solomon's ""Noonday Demon."" Both books are superb, with this book having more of a specifc focus on suicide.""Noonday Demon"" expressly addresses depression, and suicide in that context. This book is broader, and is a very careful, and helpful discussion of the factors that bring a person to suicide. Ms. Jamison does a beautiful job of not only laying out the statistics and studies of suicide, but also threading in the story of her own depression, her own suicide attempt.If you are reading this review, or reading about this book--then you need to get it. You need some help, and this book will give it to you.In addition to this book, I also recommend Alvarez's ""The Savage God: A study of suicide."""
3,"An ""okay"" read.......","Parts of this book are terrific, other parts just seem to go on forever and you can get lost in the words. The only word that comes to mind with this book is....""okay."" My son committed suicide; this book didn't help with that. However, it does shed light on the history of suicide, the autopsy issue, and the difference between boys and girls with suicide. Somewhat helpful, but there are better books out there."
4,One of the better Buzz toys,"My son (he's 5) has a pet-peeve about the Buzz toys that seem not to have Tim Allen's voice (there are some recorded phrases that play on this ship), but that's more a problem with Buzz action figures. Also, one other issue is that the ammo-rocket-thing fires by itself sometimes (with the ship placed on by bedside table last night I got shot in the head, but I live to tell the tale)."
3,"Quality could be better, but the kid loves it","My son who is almost three loves anything Buzz Lightyear so when he got this he went nuts. He plays with it a lot and doesn't seem to mind that it's actually a piece of junk. Lucky for us someone gave him mini sized Toy Story 2 action figures (Disney Store i think) at Christmas because they're the only ones that fit. I had no clue, I bought it on clearance for $9.99 and didn't even think that the normal action figures wouldn't fit. It's very flimsy and I shutter everytime he drops it. I know one of these days it will be in pieces. The rockets are kind of cool, one fires from on top, the other from under the ship. And the light up flames on the rockets add some quality to it. It's worth the 10 bucks for my kid who is getting my moneys worth out of it, but there's no way I would have paid the original $20 for it."
4,Buzz's Electronic Spaceship,"Nice, fun gadgets,rockets and my son loves it. Keep your eye's open...I paid 19.95+shipping thru Amazon and saw it at Toys R US for 11.99."
3,good toy but NO BUZZ!,"We had bought an earlier version of this ship a year ago and returned it because it fell apaprt constantly. This is a much improved version of the toy--the latches stick and the launcher is cool. HOWEVER, and this is a big problem, there are no action figures included. The previous version came with a small Buzz and a little green alien guy that fit on his back in a backpack. They are not included this time, and I am really frustrated trying to find them. The ""product features"" described say something about action figures fitting in the ship, but that is hard to manage when all of our Buzzes (and we have several) are too big for this little ship. Still, my son is loving the ship, but always with the question of when I am going to find him a Buzz that can ride in it."
2,Cant find a Buzz to fit in it,"My son loves Buzz, we have many Buzz toy dolls. None of them fit in this spacehip. And if they do (McDonalds version) they dont sit in it. So I guess you are supposed to fly around with no one in it. The red missle that launches out of it gets lost many times.My son still plays with it so I give it 2 stars."
3,Good for entry level. -Hey Ted!-,This book is a good start for entry level java programmers but lacks in advanced topics for those wishing to continue in learning.
4,A bit lacking in depth & Real examples,"I like the book overall, but it seems to be very long simply so that it can be a big book, and get that ""Bookshelf Cred"", simply to sell more books. The pages themselves are printed on very thick paper, which makes the book even bigger than neccessary. It also lacks much info on Java itself, and a Java intro/reference is also needed. The example programs are mainly toy code -- I would like to see a project being developed over the period of the book, to give experience in the whole RAD developement process... All in all, a decent introductory text, but rather cynically overmarketed, as are most Teach Yourself ... in 21 Days books -- I guess you'd expect that from the title. I recommend you buy a more in-depth, more thoroughly written and edited book that wasn't rushed to market, and contains some real meaty examples..."
1,A waste of money,"I found this book to be atrocious. Completely useless, provided you have a copy of the manual Borland (Inprise) provide with JBuilder. In fact, most of the examples in the text seem to have been taken directly from the JBuilder's JavaDoc files! I learned much more about JBuilder by following along with Borland's tutorials than be reading ""Teach yourself Jbuilder..."". My advice: read the manual to learn about JBuilder's idiosyncracies, and spend your book money on ""Object Oriented Design in Java"" by Gilbert and McCarty."
1,Throw it in the trash heap,"I had the unfortunate experience of making this my first JBuilder book purchase. Its lightweight description of JBuilder's features teaches nothing of insightful value. JBuilders help gives more than this.An example? For me, the heart of JBuilder is Borland's work on the data access components. The entire chapter on JBuilders data access tops out at 25 pages in a book of 700+ pages. The QueryDataSet gets a **whopping** 3 pages, intermingled with useless code snippets.I think this book would have been better served if it had concentrated on the more important capabilities of JBuilder. Granted it is an introductory text, but so much so that it is hard to accomplish much worthwhile after reading it."
1,VERY POOR DO NOT ORDER,This item arrived today . Missing parts and very brittle must be left over stock from the 70s. Decals are poor quality and unless you have 10 plus hours to put into this model do not buy. Skill level must be a 5. It is not easy to buld as advertised.
4,Not just for old people,"When I first bought this CD, all my Japanese friends looked at me really funny, because, apparently, only old Japanese people listen to this stuff. I'm glad that I bought it, though. It's different from traditional stuff in the pace. If you listen to most of the 3-string guitar stuff from Asia, it's all kinda slow, and there's a lot of rests between each ""plink"" sound. But on this album, everything's pretty fast, so you definitely won't fall asleep. I took off one star, since some of the tracks sound pretty much the same."
5,Authentic Trip Down Memory Lane,"Author Frank Urso celebrates the Ybor City and Sicilian heritage of my childhood. As a second generation American, I found his autobiography often reflected similar memories of my own grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles. I could identify with many of his childhood experiences in Ybor City -- some funny, some simple slices of day-to-day life, some deeply poignant, and all insightful. In fact, in a couple of passages, I was pleasantly surprised to find he actually mentions two of my uncles, one paternal and one maternal. Mr. Urso writes about life as a child of Sicilian immigrants from a generation that, sadly, will soon be gone. His book will help share their stories with our children and grandchildren."
2,Think twice before you buy,"Agree with other reviewers. The blades are light weighted and fragile. The overall quality is only a little better than those sold in dollar stores.If you are looking for something sturdy, don't waist money on the silverpoint series."
3,A bit better than you pay for,"I bought these knives because of the Wusthof brand and the low price. When I first got them, I have to agree with others that I was disappointed with the plastic handles and lightness, but having lived with them for a year I'm happier than I thought I'd be. They're light, but very sharp, and if all you're doing is slicing, the lightness can actually be an advantage. They wouldn't be so great for crunching through bones (although they do chop nuts easily) and I don't know what the lightness means for their long run durability. The real question most people should ask is do they want all these knives or would they be better off just getting a higher quality chef's knife and a paring knife."
1,Wustof Silverpoint Knives,"I recently placed an order for the Silverpoint knives and found them to be inferior to the standard Wustof line of knives. I returned them and purchased the Grand Prix II block set. The Silverpoint series was in my opinion a cheap represntation of the standard line of knives, lightweight, thin and unable to do the job. The standard series of knives which are forged in lieu of stamped are of much better quality, heftier and easier to use. I think Wustof is selling a cheap imitation with the Silverpoint series which is not worth the money. Stick with the standard knife lines you will be surprised by the difference in quality, much superior and well worth the extra money."
1,After less than a year they are already showing corrosion,Not a good buy. Cheap stuff that will rust very fast. Issues with the stainless steel.
4,This will last for almost 2 years,This will last for almost 2 years which is better than the original Panasonic one. Those last for only 3 months. This battery makes the Panasonic phone work as advertised; I could use the speaker phone for the first time. The price is lowest but the shipping is a rip off. I was about to checkout and then noticed the high shipping. Finally brought this from Cyber gift center.
5,Instant longer battery life!,"I agree with other reviewers about the very poor performance of the stock panasonic phone batteries. These easily last twice as long! I always hated the short battery life of stock batteries and was ready to get a new phone. The only thing that saved the phone from the trash was that it was expensive and that it came with two handsets that let me switch between them. Since I got these batteries, I haven't had to switch handsets while talking due to a low battery."
1,Watch out for the shipping charge!,"These batteries are priced attractively, but eek Technology wants to charge a ridiculous amount for shipping -- almost $23 for 3 of these batteries, shipped by regular ground service.I questioned them on their shipping price and they claim it's an incorrect product weight on amazon.com and it's impossible for them to change it. But unless someone complains, they're happy to just pocket that extra profit."
5,GREAT BUY!!,Arrived sooner than expected and they were exactly as described and priced. I was very happy.
3,homemade user,I followed the instructions posted by others and was able to make my own battery using 3 of the 2500 energizer nimh. I used some aluminum strips I cut from ducting because I felt they would be a little more durable and pass the current easier. I also found that by using a dremel I was able to make the cavity in the phone bigger where the positive terminal nub+aluminum strip was a tight squeeze. The first pack I tried to make I had to take apart and do over because when I tried to squeeze it in I think I messed up the nub/strip part. I definately recommend the homemade solution.
1,Inaccurate battery nomencalture,I did a search for a 80-5808-00-00 cordless phone and this is what showed - it is a 3 cell battery and the one for the phone battery I was looking for is a 2 cell battery. This is not a replacement for the 80-5808-00-00 even though it says it is.
1,Another home made battery user here!,"After reading these revues I got a pack of Duracell 2650 mAh AA NiMH batteries and made my own with aluminium foil and electricians tape. Works great and the range is AT LEAST doubled!Best of all, it only cost $12, vs. ~$20 for a ""real"" battery!"
4,Worked great with existing chargers!,"I'm very happy with these batteries. I had the original Panasonics, which stopped holding a charge after about 6 months. (We have 5 cordless phones in heavy use.) Switched to the Radioshack version, which worked better, although the battery would still die without warning during a call. But after 2 years when we went to purchase a replacement, their price had gone way up to almost $20 each. Did some research, and decided to try these. They work much better. Last longer between charges AND we get a low battery warning in time to switch to another handset. We used the original chargers for all three brands of batteries with no problems."
5,Battery replacement,"Our Panasonic cordless phone kept running low on power, and needed more frequent recharging. I went online and found this Energizer replacement battery on Amazon.com that people said lasted longer. I bought one and have been very pleased with its storage capacity and length of calls allowed."
5,A unique account,"The book was given to me by the author himself with dedication and as soon as I read it it became my absolute favourite. IFOR on IFOR has the largest accumulation of reviews, interviews and facts as well as interesting thoughts not only by the author himself but by the interviewed soldiers as well. As the author is in Bosnia from 1993, he knows the situation so if you need a close-up look on our rugged country check this book out."
2,Iffy book,"Book has a good layout, I'll give it that, but after being in Jeet Kune Do for the past 9 years this book didn't show me anything new at all. Even if not a totally new technique I was at least expecting doing something old in a new way, which I didn't find in this book. I don't really know if this book is even that good for beginners, as this thing is so basic I don't know that everything is explained as well as it should be. If you are in a ""reality"" martial art or study under a decent instructor that shows and knows combat applications, don't get this book, I really wished I hadn't bought it now. Mr. Lima is good at what he does I'm sure, but I think the martial arts world would have been fine without this book."
4,"It's Great, But...","This is a book many old-time radio enthusiasts have been looking for: a book that covers the stars of old-time radio, gives their biographies and their radio credits! From what I've seen, this is the most detailed and accurate book there is. Having said that, I must point out that there are a few problems with the book. I wish the information was better documented for one thing. For another, sometimes the years of birth the author gives for the stars makes me wonder, ""Where did he find that?"" For example, almost all books on Abbott and Costello state that Bud was born in 1895 and Lou in 1906. However, this book puts their years of birth in 1900 and 1908 respectively. There are many other dates in the book that cause me to wonder, ""Where did he come up with that?"" With that nit-picking out of the way, I must close by saying that overall it's a great reference guide to old-time radio. There should be more books that are this well written."
2,Is this the best they could do?,"A compilation album should be more than just the music, it should be a package that really represents the artist, like Kate's box set. This looks like it was assembled by one of those TV mail-order companies. Only two photos, bad typography, and it's hardly the whole story when several singles and moments from her career (pre-1986, when this was issued) aren't on this. No ""Hammer Horror,"" nothing from the Hammersmith concert or the ""Stage"" EP, no Christmas single, no ""There Goes a Tenner,"" and so on. This is product with profit as the sole motive."
3,Bought as a gift,"I bought this CD as a gift for a woman I was seeing. She didn't thank me and soon dumped me via text message. I cant blame the CD, don't realy know the artist, but ouch...leaves a bad taste in my mouth. How do you like my highly personalized opinion/review? LOL tired of Amazon wanting me to review the CD, keeps popping up, bad memories...."
4,Great album but...,I was surprised to see that this album reached the top thirty in Australia. I LOVE KATE BUSH. I have all her albums but...The main problem with The Whole Story is that it doesn't feature all of her truly great works. It also suffers in a way that ABBA GOLD suffers - it is recorded from a UK point of view hence some of the songs didn't chart elsewhere. An example is Australia - Babooshka and Wuthering Heights are the only songs on this album that charted. I'm lost? Maybe when they release her next GREATEST HITS album (which is apparently happening this year and featuring all her hits from 1978-1993) they can make it appeal to worldwide fans.
2,No Story Here,"To begin with, a remix of 'Wuthering Heights' is put on this compilation instead of the original. The reason for that is clear as day - to mislead consumers into believing they are getting a better version of a song that simply put, doesn't need remixing! This compilation was quickly rushed out for the Xmas season as record companies did in the 80's. I doubt Kate had any input into it. Aside from that, the main hits are here, but I strongly suggest readers getting hold of 'The Kick Inside' which is her best album to date. It is like a greatest hits in itself. Magic, magic, magic !"
5,Great CD and introduction to Kate Bush,"You buy compellation CDs to find artists you might like. You buy ""best of"" CDs to check out the artist. This is a great buy, consisting of Kate Bush's most famous songs. ""Cloudbusting"" and ""Running Up That Hill"" are here, along with a version of ""Wuthering Heights"" with less helium-inspired vocals than the original. Excellent CD, and highly recommended."
1,New Vocals in Wuthering Heights recorded in bathroom?,"Yes, sure, great songs by this talented artist. But why did they include New Vocals in Wuthering Heights? The song sounds like it is recorded in some bathroom. Absolute a no buy, or.....do like me and make a new recording, including the original wuthering heights, ripped from vinyl."
4,"Not the ""Whole"" Bush. It's been trimmed.","Kate Bush is in desperate need of a newer collection. Since this was released in the vinyl era, it now should have more than 12 songs, and it's 25 years old! It really needs remastering, as I have to crank the stereo to hear it across the room. And of course it should include songs from her last couple albums. Take this collection, add ""Rubberband Girl"", ""This Woman's Work"" and ""King Of The Mountain"", plus a few, remastered. That's the ""whole"" story."
5,Textbook,I ordered this book for classes and it came immediately in the new condition as promised. I wish all amazon experiences were like this one.
5,Arrggghhh Matey!,"Once again Haba comes through with a wonderful and creative game option for kids. The Black Pirate Game is a fun adventure for your little pirates. Using ""billows"", players move their ships looking for gold. But you have to watch out for the black pirate ship! Each player has a chance to play the roll of the pillaging pirate, according how they roll the dice. Whether you're searching for gold as your own color coded ship or ramming other ships and stealing their gold, it's a fast paced and refreshing game which utilizes motor skills and strategy.The board itself, like other Haba games is very visually appealing. The ocean is beautiful shades of blue and the little islands are raised and inviting, and the ships have real cloth sails. There are no plastic pieces and no toxic chemicals to worry about."
4,Family game for 4's to 84's and beyond,"This game is a great family game - we were on an equal footing with a 4 year old, his mother and his great uncle. The directions were easily understood and the boats moved around the board wih the help of a chip blower capturing gold and pillaging others."
1,Description of Item IS Totally Erroneous,This review is for Celice [CD-SINGLE] [ENHANCED] [IMPORT] ASIN: B000BKUXCE. My parents purchased this CD for me from AMAZON. It is supposed to have the following according to the Product Details:Celice (Radio Edit)Celice (Live At Frognerparken)Celice (Paul Van Dyk Radio Edit)The Summers Of Our YouthVideo - Celice / Enhanced MaterialTo my amazement and astonishment it only has two cuts: Celice (Radio Edit) and Celice (Thomas Schumacher Remix) and NO ENHANCED material at all. Do not order this item as listed. I am totally upset and feel that my parents got ripped off big time.
2,a-ha deserves better,"This is a wonderful song marred by the inexplicable failures of the record company to be consistent with the admirable job they did on the full length release. The special version of the album, with the DVD, is an example of a record company fulfilling its obligation to the customers to give them lots of value for their money. This keeps people buying the physical product, as opposed to simply downloading everything.Why release a two song disc and charge thirteen bucks for it?Is it to capitalize on the craving for the song at the expense of the customer getting real value. A-ha deserves much better than this.Stick with the album (which is an amazing accomplishment of creativity) and only buy those ""single discs"" that give us plenty of music for our money."
1,Melodious Rock but NO ENHANCED CD Here,"I just received my copy of CELICE from AMAZON about an hour ago. I played it once and then came back and played it about half an hour later. CELICE (radio cut) is a very good song. It rocks and retains a-ha's familiar melodious delivery. It sounds great and I indeed like it. a-ha is back! However, the Thomas Schumacher Remix is not a good fit with a-ha's sound. Also and somewhat more important I should note that this is NOT an Enhanced CD as advertised. I should give this 5 stars for CELICE (radio cut) but this is not the product I purchased as advertised. I am a little disappointed here."
3,the war on men,"Think about this....There are a lot of bible scriptures on this subject. The bible,[god's word], makes it clear that the woman is not under the man's feet, there is to be respect for both sides. does a man cleaning toilets make him less than a man? Perhaps, the author should have taken notes from Bill Cosby of The Cosby Show?Also, does anyone know what the old term [word] 'chivalry' mean? God sure does! I encourage everyone reading this to look the word up. I remember as I grew up more than 30 years ago, there were a lot of husbands/boyfriends that emotionally/physically hurt girls/wives."
3,Academic Paper,"The author touched on THE most important political issue of our day NOT talked about from an academic perspective. There was little emotion or outrage over the many facts presented. Hopefully, reading this book will lead to reading others on this most important subject."
5,SORELY NEEDED INJECTION OF TRUTH INTO THE DISCUSSION,This book counters the lies and propaganda foisted upon us by feminist dominated media. Prepare to be outraged. It's about time. To Hise I say: Bravo!
5,Move MOVES!,"The Yoshida Brothers, two very (21 and 23 years old) musicians, perform original and traditional music on shamisen in a way that ROCKS! A very beautiful and original cd, by two talented and daring young artists."
2,Overly Melodramatic,"Despite the prominence of Bette Davis and Shelley Winters on the video cover, Gary Merrill is actually the star of ""Phone Call from a Stranger."" He plays a lawyer who visits the families of several people he met on a doomed flight. During these visits, he solves many of their problems and has an epiphany of his own. The movie has a terrific cast, including three Oscar winners (Davis, Winters, and Beatrice Straight). Unfortunately, the film is overly melodramatic, replete with swelling music and over-the-top breakdowns. Fans of Bette Davis also will likely be disappointed, as she has a small part (that really doesn't fit her well) and doesn't appear until near the end. She likely appeared in this film as a favor for her then-husband - Merrill. Overall, this film is a typical 50s melodrama: not terrible but entirely forgettable."
5,This is a Phone Call From A Stranger You Should Pick Up,"Bette Davis gives a man the strength to save his marriage.A plane crash puts an end to the sufferings of three ill-fated passengers but leads to a second chance for the fourth, a man who believes his wife no longer loves him. Starring Gary Merrill, Shelley Winters, Keenan Wynn, and Michael Rennie as the passengers and Bette Davis in a standout performance as an invalid widow who seeks to guide the survivor on a journey to understanding. Phone Call From A Stranger boasts the unbeatable combination of a brilliant cast and an engraving plot line. It is a movie that will inspire as well as move you.This is a fabulous inspiring movie that I highly suggest to all."
4,"Good film, but beware!","As the sole survivor of a plane crash, Gary Merrill becomes dedicated to tying up all of the loose ends of his friends who died in the crash. While mending the lives of others, he discovers a way to mend his own.The problem I had with this film is that I really expected it to be a Bette Davis picture. I was very disappointed to find that after waiting for over half the movie, Bette's part was only a cameo. She gives a great performance in the film, and her sad saga could break your heart, but it wasn't what I had expected.However, when I reevaluated this film, I actually quite enjoyed it. Shelley Winters is quite comical, and Gary Merrill is all man. The plot is original, and the stories of the passengers aboard the doomed flight range from hilarious to tear-jerking. It's at least worth a rental."
3,"Decent, short but good performance by Bette Davis",This movie is a kind of a precursor of Peter Weir's Fearless. It is mainly about bereavement and how we deal with it. The subject matter is treated in an un-melodramatic way and with tact. Bette Davis is very strong as the bedridden wife who meets the survivor of a plain crash in which her husband died.
2,Bring the Kleenex,"It's a great Sunday afternoon movie. In reality, the performance of Shelly Winters is the best part. Since Gary Merrill and Bette Davis were married when this movie was made, there had to be some scenes with them together. But sadly, those scenes were not the best ones.But if you are a Shelly Winters fan, this is a must see. If you are a Bette Davis fan, you will be disappointed."
3,The complete Chinese Crested (Book of the Breed)`,This is a very basic book on the breed. It is ok for someone who doesn't know anything about the Crested and the pictures are good but it doesn't give nearly enought detail information for people who already own a Crested.
5,"Come for the Tori Amos & BNL, stay for the Peter Mulvey & Jonatha Brooke",Ever play that game where you have to say which albums you would want if stranded on a deserted island? This is one of them. A great mix of artists you know and artists you didn't know but who hook you in with one song. Listen to this CD! (Especially if you're flying over a deserted island soon.)
2,five very basic moves,"Short on substance. This just has 5 very basic side to side moves. Gets boring fast. No chaptering, you have to sit through the whole salsa lesson for the moves."
3,Not too bad,This is a fair video for beginners. The man shows the men's steps while the woman shows the woman's steps. They seem to dance well together. It looks like it was filmed in someone's living room. But that also tells you a lot of space isn't needed to dance. So I give it three stars.
3,Nice idea IF your bird will use it.,"I have a young parrotlet and had read that some birds do NOT like placing their heads in a somewhat enclosed area to feed. This proved true for my parrotlet. For some reason, she will not eat out these dishes. They've been properly cleaned, but my goofy bird won't use them.The design is a great idea to keep food from being scattered around, which is why I purchased them to begin with. Perhaps other kinds of small birds will use them but, unfortunately, my parrotlet did not."
2,Cockatiel is terrified of this,"I bought this for our cockatiel, thinking it would minimize the amount of pellets that spray while he eats. However, he refuses to eat out of this dish in his cage. He shows some hesitation, but will eat treats from it outside the cage. He will not go near it inside the cage. My biggest complaint is that we were unable to choose the color. Ours arrived as a marbled black color, which could contribute to the problem-- I am not sure if red or blue would have the same effect."
3,"Good theory, hard to remove and clean","I ordered these from Amazon and because of Hurricane Sandy, they got lost in transit. The company notified me that they were lost before I was even scheduled for delivery. They refunded my $. They evidently have great customer service, however, it still left me with no dishes, so I bought them elsewhere.They don't hold as much as you would think for being a ""large"" dish, but they do cut down on mess. I actually put them into a holder made for a metal dish that sits on the bars, just so I could easily remove to clean without unscrewing."
1,birds where scared,Thought this was a cool dish to get so the birds wouldn't throw there food around. Well they were to scared to eat anything out of it. I think because it was to dark for them to see.... I ended out tossing it.
4,Science Fiction Without Boundaries,"Arkham House co-founder, friend and correspondent of H.P. Lovecraft, and a highly respected writer for the pulps in the late 20s and 30s - Donald Wandrei was considered a poet and visionary by HPL and Clark Ashton Smith. His stories of alien intrusions and universe shaking cataclysms are somewhat dated to those who are only used to the psychologically driven fiction of more modern years. His unique visions were considered groundbreaking when first published and are still highly entertaining decades later. This is first of all an enjoyable read as well as a fascinating look at the beginning of modern science fiction."
2,short life,"My GPX 5"" portable b/w TV is slightly less than 3 years old and has died a slow death over past four months. First, the screen started to roll and no amount of tinkering with the back of the TV would stop it. This has not been a huge problem since I use this TV largely for sound while I am doing household chores. In the last two months, the on/off switch has become increasingly unreliable. Sometimes I have been able to get the TV to click on but at other times no amount of clicking will kick the TV into gear. Last week, for four days in a row, it refused to turn on (the switch for the radio still works). So I have given the TV a proper burial. Should I have expected more from a $30 TV? I have purchased a different brand of 5"" TV and will see if I get more than just over two years of good service from it."
1,Marketing gang activity to white america and corrupting kids,This CD is a perfect example of what is wrong with america. CD's like this produce negativity to our youth. The reason why so many gangs exist in small uknown communities is because of this music and influence. It is total trash.
4,Interesting read,"This book describes a very interesting and different type of theatre that involves movement, specifically using the feet to portray characters and a story. There are detailed descriptions on how to achieve this and even descriptions of exercises to do with actors. Suzuki also writes about his feelings regarding other theatrical design elements, such as setting and relationship with the audience.The one downfall to this is that for someone trained in realism, or say, musical theatre, the Suzuki method to theatre is difficult to embody and fully understand when using this book alone."
3,Not a warm white bulb,"This bulb is perhaps 1/2"" taller than the tungsten 3-way it replaced and stays full diameter all the way to the top-- in my floor lamp the harp was short enough that it was a little difficult to get into place to start it in the socket. While the brightness of the three settings is comparable to the old 3-way, this lamp has a noticeable ""cold white"" or blue-white color that I find typical of all but a few of the newer CFEL bulbs."
1,Very short lifespan,"All the CFLs I've tried have had a lifespan no longer than, and sometimes shorter than, an equivalent incandescant bulb. That's particularly true of this Sylvania 3-way bulb which had a lifespan of about a year. I'm definitely not buying any more 3-way CFLs, and am considering going back to standard light bulbs across the board. They are just not living up to the promise of longer life, which is particularly a problem since they have to be recycled as hazardous waste."
2,3 Way compact lights don't fit inside standard harps,"I bought a Sylvania 3-way 30-70-100 bulb, and the light is great. However it will not fit into a single table or floor lamp in my house - the base is too wide to close the harp. In the case of one of the table lamps the harp is too low - but that's fixable by getting a taller harp."
5,John's finest hour and a darker set of original songs,Johns songs here are getting darker and the band wrote an unprecedented 14 songs for this strong third album. Paul also shows his darker side on Things we said today.
4,Made a bit of a boo boo on my last review,"I said that ""Revolver"" was the album with ""Norwegian Wood,"" ""Drive My Car"" and all those. Of course it's actually ""Rubber Soul."" Darn those Beatles for starting both albums with the letter ""R.""Also, I made a mistake when I characterized the intro of ""And I Love Her"" as bass and percussion. It's actually guitar and percussion.Sorry!"
3,What happened to the actual soundtrack?,"I love this album with the wonderful songs the Beatles sang from their first groundbreaking film. But I think the recording doesn't do justice to the entire film. It leaves out all the instrumental music that was integral to the feeling of the film. Everytime I listen to this I keep expecting some small interlude of the ""in between"" sounds and feel let down that they aren't there anymore.And I have to agree to those who think the remastered sound isn't at it's best. I just keep listening because it's the best I can do. Wish I still had my original RLP!"
1,geht mir auf den sack! nur in mono!,This one is recorded in mono only. I guess it was digitally remastered but in fact was not!PS: only for beatles fans!
5,beatles 1st movie,"this movie that goes with the disc,is basicly all about the beatles running from hoardes of crazy groupies.the title track is really good and a #1.""i shouldve known better"" is 2nd and self explanetory about a chick.""if i fell"" is a sad john song.its one of the best ones on the album.""im happy just to dance with you"" is really cool too.then theres the best song on the album,a very pretty ""and i love her"".then its ""tell me why"" about a guy trying to figure out a chick.good luck.""cant by me love"" is about how money cant buy love.no,but itll get the boom boom booming!""ill cry instead"" is depressing as you probobaly ascertained.the last 4 are good.they are ""things we said today""[nolstalgic],""when i get home""-a wanna be a hard days night,""you cant do that"" and lastly,""ill be back"".its cool."
4,Their first film!,"What can I say but another classic. Many memorable tunes here like the title track and ""If I Fell"" among others. Nothing can stop The Beatles by this point."
5,The finest music of our time,"This is vintage Beatles...the Rock world will never have a group like this again...multi talented...full of energy and liked by everyone...they are a phenomenom of the 20th century which the likes will never be repeated, but mimicked...all music lovers shoul have all of their music...all music is based on it...5 stars all the way."
3,Beatles Movie Soundtrack!,"This album has some classic songs on it such as the title A Hard Days Night.I Should Have Known Better is next and i love that song.Other favourites are And I Love Her,Can't Buy Me Love,Things We Said Today and I'll Be Back.Now i may get some arguements from some Beatle fans here but this is one of my least played Beatle albums.Im a big fan of The Beatles but i think that their heavy touring scedule and making this movie took its toll on the quality of this album.Some of the songs are good,but there is a couple that i dont like.2 songs i can live without are If I Fell and When I Get Home.This is their 3rd album and not as good as the first 2.But upon being a bit critical,this album still is worth getting cause those songs i mentioned that are my fav's,are brilliant."
5,A Hard Day's Night,"In my opinion, this captures the sound and the energy of what the Beatles are most remembered for. Everything after this was downhill."
3,Could be stronger,"""A Hard Day's Night"" is a nice Beatles album, but it's not the best. Most of the second half could be better, but hey, with a hectic schedule like The Beatles' in 1964, I don't blame them for not writing the best stuff under such pressure. But, they did pretty well for being so busy. This is the only album to contain completely Lennon/McCartney songs, and they are all love songs. I love side one, especially ""And I Love Her."" It's the kind of song that's slow and romantic, but isn't too drippy. ""Tell Me Why"" is great cause it's upbeat and happy sounding, although the lyrics aren't.The only ones that I would skip over are ""I'll Be Back"" and ""When I Get Home"", which are both sort of boring and maybe ""You Can't Do That"" which is pretty harsh. Other than those few, it's a good album."
5,The first all Lennon-McCartney album,"which was quite a rarity for the early to mid-1960's. As folks can see with ""Please Please Me"" and ""With The Beatles"" (or ""Meet the Beatles"" as it was originally called), solo singers and groups back in those days either covered the earlier rock and roll tunes or they simply sung a songwriters composition.Lennon and McCartney really showed the world that they were serious musicians who were here to stay. Remember, this album was released right in the middle of the hysteria that was Beatlemania, when the press already wrote them off as the latest bubble gum pop sensation whose bubble was ready to burst at any given second.The movie itself was a spoof of what they went through in those days complete with their characteristic charm and witty asides. The soundtrack is a great addition to the movie.The Beatles are God divided by four. They are the alpha and the omega of music."
4,Whats so hard about their day?,"This is not only an awesome C.D. but an awesome movie also, but what i dont understand is why they have it so bad.....they're millionaires and have all these girls chasing them......i really didn't like the Beatles till my strange friend Nigel got me into them......I dont enjoy that much oldies music but this is a C.D. I can really enjoy......well i hope i helped you on you're journey.."
2,Not Impressed,"It sounds different.Perhaps better than the English mono version ,but to my ears the 8 songs in stereo from A Hard Days Night on Something New sound much better.I also prefer A Hard Days Night and Cant Buy me Love on Beatles""1"" .On these remasters the songs sound polished and clean.In some cases too slick.The bottom end is boosted but I dont think its an improvment.Sounds a bit woolly. The biting clarity of Lennons Rickenbacker on Happy Just To Dance and Tell Me Why is gone.Im not sold on these new releases.Of course the music is great so it really doesnt matter about these details.I have bought 6 of these releases but I wont buy any more."
5,If you liked the music....,You have got to get the movie. The 4 mop-tops really know how to make you laugh!!
4,Fun rock 'n' roll album.,"This was the first Beatles album I had ever heard - we had it on cassette and, like Highway Sixty-One Revisited, my dad played it all the time. I really enjoyed it.While it's not their best, it's certainly good. Highlights include the title track, I Should Have Known Better, I'm Happy Just to Dance With You, And I Love Her, and Can't Buy Me Love, although every song is good (except for some filler later on, such as I'll Be Back.) It's a good intro to the Beatles."
5,A Hard Days Night Soundtrack,The disc arrived in a timely manner and well packaged. No scratches and plays perfectly dispite the fact that there isn't any jewel case nor picture insert
4,Very Good Rock Album,"This album by the Beatles represents a pinnacle of success of that period of rock and roll. It may not have the creativity and innovative style of some of the later albums, but as plain old rock and roll it's hard to beat this album. It kicks from the very beginning and is just filled with great chords and rock songs. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is of course a favorite among many, myself included, but that is one of many great songs on this album."
4,Hardly A Day's Night.,Good sound track. Again it's a C.D. of some favorite tunes made famous by the Radio Stations that played them.
4,Why the tight box?,"Music is (as always) great! And since I own every Beatles' LP (vinyl), and I just ripped the remastered discs to my iTunes library, I'm giving 4-stars to what I would normally give 1-star, even though these reviews are for the item, not just the music, and the item is really flawed:For gods' sake, why are the discs in slots so small??? This applies to every remastered Beatles disc I bought from Amazon:White, SgtPepper,Revolver,PleasePleaseMe,RubberSoul,MagicalMystery,withtheBeatles,HardDay's,AbbeyRoad... but it's really difficult to get the damned discs out of the White Album!RIDICULOUS!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I played this disc factory new on a brand new CD player, and it would not play without skips and stops and starts on each song. I returned the disc thinking it was defective, and the replacement copy did the same thing. Since the earlier release of this CD in the jewel case plays fine, it has to be something about this remastered version that my player doesn't like. If I were you, I'd try one out before you buy the whole collection in remastered form."
3,Not Their Best but OK,"Let's face the music (no pun intended): the early Beatles sucked. All of their songs sound the same and they are irritatingly repetitive. But what can I say, I still love them! While most of this CD however is forgettable, the classics ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""And I Love Her"" are sweet, innocent, and boppy."
5,"A great CD, but what else would you expect from the Beatles?","This is a fabulous CD to add to your collection! Every song on this is a great song to listen and dance to. I guarantee you'll be singing along! I bought this CD because I saw the movie (a great movie), and what a surprise I got when I found six other fabulous songs on it that weren't even in the movie! You won't regret getting this!"
3,Nothing like or as good as the original,"While there are some good songs on the CD from the movie, much more was left out. The REAL soundtrack was inventive and new (for 1965). I can understand why other songs were included but to leave 1/3 of the film's music off this CD is a crying shame. This Boy is a wonderful instrumental and the fabulous instrumental version of a Hard Day's Night shows you where Sgt. Pepper's and the later albums wonderful mix of instruments and musical phrasing really began. If you've still got a turntable, find the original vinyl album and really enjoy the music."
1,not the original soundtrack!,"this is not the original soundtrack from the movie a hard day's night. there are 4 instrumental songs that george martin conducted on the soundtrack. #1, i should have known better #2, and i love her #3, ringo's theme (this boy) #4, a hard day's night. why weren't they on the soundtrack beats me. he did a awsome job on these 4 songs. how i know is that i have 2 vinyl soundtracks from the movie when it came out & the cd soundtrack by united artists (cd cost me over $40.00 dollars - import from japan). so double check your purchases and see if these 4 songs are on the soundtrack. take care!"
5,Old Favourites,Forgot how much I liked their stuff so bought a slew of Beatle CD's and have been thoroughly enjoying them ever since.
4,The Fab Four At Their Finest!,"This movie,""A Hard Day's Night"" was the first movie ever done by the Beatles. As a fan of the Beatles I was overwhelmed by the movie.You are shown the Beatles alive in actual concert activity.You are shown the Beatles interacting with their fans.But mostimportant you are treated to some of the finest music ever put out by the Beatles.You have songs sonch as ""A Hard Day's Night"",""I Should have Known Better""and various other monster hits by the Beatles.If you are a true Beatles fan,this is your movie. Buy this movie and enjoy Paul McCartney,John Lennon, George Harrison,and Ringo Starr,the phenomenon known as the Beatles."
5,"More than just listenable, all the way through","I've been filling holes in my music collection, including buying a Beatles release every few months. Each has been full of great reminders, and some even taught me things I didn't know - about the Beatles, about music, or about life.This release isn't really about learning anything, but that makes it imminently enjoyable. To modern ears, it doesn't feel like it's pushing any boundaries, but that keeps it from challenging any sensibilities. Instead, all the songs are complete and strong and enjoyable. Bravo!"
5,British Invasion by A hard's Days Night,"This Album exactly tells why the Beatles can invade Amercia.The best in this abbum is "" I should have known better"", you can easily think of the four boys in the train playing cards and guitars.Kevin Li"
5,The only all Lennon-McCartney compositions Beatles' album,"Seven great performances from John Lennon:A Hard Day's NightI Should Have Known BetterIf I FellTell Me WhyAny Time At AllYou Can't do ThatI'll Be BackMcCartney also has 3 terrific solos:And I Love HerCan't Buy Me LoveThings We Said TodayThere is. of course, some great vocal harmony supporting these songs.In this album, both Lennon and McCartney have given us some interesting songs which waver between minor and major tonalities:And I Love Her and If I Fell begin minor, but end up major. However the McCartney song Things We Said Today and the Lennon song I'll Be Back hover intriguingly between minor and major keys throughout.Tell Me Why may be one of the most jazz-influenced Beatles song: the chords and melody owe quite a bit to that genre. Can't Buy Me Love also has a jazzy tinge.Acoustic guitars [including the 12 stringed variety] are prominent and sound terrific.Highly recommended"
5,One Of My Favorite Beatles Albums,"I love this album, A Hard Day's Night is one of my favorite Beatles albums, because this has very good songs and most of the songs are about love. The sound is outstanding and perfectly remastered. It feature seven songs from the movie. My favorite tracks are ""A Hard Days Night,"" ""If I fell,"" ""And I Love Her,"" ""Tell Me Why,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" and ""I'll Cry Instead."" If you love this album, then you're gonna love the movie. I highly recommend this album to your Beatles collection."
1,you MUST be joking right?,"this ""band"" if that's what you want to call these posers. are nothing,but a fadded teen idol POP group from back in the day. they were basically the back in the day version of n sync. they copied other bands to make themselfs look good. do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this album don't even accpect it even if it's free! the loser bug POP group is a waste of time and they are SO BORING just like the boring no life baby boomers defending them. this album has pointless tracks and they are ALL boring to listen to. they WEREN'T the ""greatest"" or ""the best"" they SUCKED! they WERE ALL STUDIO,they couldn't play *** live from what i heard and NO i am NOT some loser baby boomer. skip this album.IN FACT SKIP THE BEATLES ALL TOGETHER!"
1,Same old Beatles Stuff,"The Beatles had one formula and boy, they sure stuck with it. A Hard Days Night is a fun song to listen to. As usual, its nothing really great but its fun. I Should Have Known Better gets on my nerves tremendously, but then, so does the majority of their music. Actually, theres really not much to say about this album. I agree with the reviews that said it sounds the same so theres really no use for me to talk about each song. All in all, its a pretty dull album and if you want to hear good music from the early sixties then listen to the Stones instead.At least their early stuff was always Interesting."
1,"Bad movie, worse music","This is bad. The Beatles were so overhyped, an this movie proves it.A Hard Day's Night put me in a deep sleep."
4,Informative and useful,"The book is lacking in large detailed illustrations, but it is useful for gaining a general understanding of the history and purpose of the art form. For the money, it is worthwhile. If you want something with lots of detailed pictures this is not the book for you."
