2,"Silly, frustrating, unsatisfying (Spoilers)","Caution: Spoilers. A silly plot and unsatisfying ending. A gay man is on the brink of getting into a hetero marriage when the long lost gay ""love of his life"" returns (at the bride's secret invitation to ""test"" her finance's true orientation) to try to ""save"" him (a la ""My Best Friend's Wedding""). The gay lovers decide to forego their love for each other because the long lost friend thinks the bride-to-be is ""cool."" So the gay groom-to-be and the bride-to-be decide, at the alter, to have a commitment ceremony instead of a wedding. DUMB,DUMB, DUMB, but then Tori S. does play the bride. The only redeeming feature of the film is the male ""eye candy"" on display."
5,It's 3 in the afternoon...and I'm Drunk,"This is a fun film, showing that Tori Spelling is more then just her last name. She shines in her role as Alex, a quirky fun-loving woman about to marry. What she doesn't know is that her husband to be used to be with another man. With a great soundtrack done by Levi Kreis this is a WORTH WATCH!!"
3,Light and not too challenging,"""Kiss the bride"" is one of those comedies you can watch during lazy afternoon, when there's nothing else to watch. The storyline is not complicated (a gay is invited to a straight-wedding of his old-flame, first gay love). Of course bride-to-be appears to be a very nice, uber-friendly girl (Tori did her best here) so our gay hero is really torn (as well as his straight mate).If it sounds slightly familiar to you, don't look any further than this film itself. In one of the dialogues pops-up a title of another ""wedding"" comedy and that is ""My best friend's wedding"". Yep, ""Kiss the..."" has some resomblence to its predecessor, unfortunately is not equally wonderful.Anyway, although it's not on my shopping list, I don't regret the time I spent watching it."
2,Should separate narration from music...,"I got this CD set thinking that the narrated sections were on tracks that I could skip if I wanted to. This is not the case. To listen to the music you have to sit through the dialogue. Great for teaching kids American history, but not for just demonstrating the songs of the time. They really should have kept it separated (or used detailed liner notes)."
1,slips right off,"I did not really care for this product. The collar slipped right off my dog. The Customer service rep was really accomodating and was willing to send me a smaller one, but I really doubt that would even do the trick. I have a 7 pound dog and a 16 pound dog and this collar was even too loose for the 16 pound dog. He just took it right off. The thing wouldn't stay on at all. As soon as I put it on, my dog would shake his head a little and the thing would fall right off. I would not buy another one."
2,Do Not Use a Dishwasher!,"Whatever you do, DO NOT put these knives in a dishwasher. I did since there was nothing in or on the box which gave a warning. The result - the handles deteriorated in the process (changed color, surface wore off). The knives also do not fit snugly into their holder.One good feature - they do, supposedly, have a lifetime guarantee. We'll see what happens when I write the company to explain the dishwashing nightmare!"
2,Would Be Feel Good Comedy Falls Flat,"Ok, so I'm a BIG fan of romantic-feel good comedies. This isn't one of the best. A good romantic comedy has likeable characters, a good plot, and plenty of great comic scenes to keep you laughing. This film has decent characters (although the chemistry falls pretty flat) a so-so plot, (basically a marriage preperation course that takes the couple through every last tiff and argument in a matter of a few days,) and a couple pretty funny scenes (the scenes involving the robot babies were quite hilarious.) The main problems with this film were it's constant mockery of Christianity (while oddly trying to act supportive??) It's far fetched plot elements (the end is silly it's so far fetched,) and the lack of chemistry between the two leads (could've been FAR better.)Overall, this wasn't the worst romantic comedy I've ever seen (Two Weeks Notice takes that award) but certainly wasn't among the greats."
4,Frivolous and Fun,"This was an entertaining trip down the aisle with John Krasinski and Mandy Moore. The two make an endearing couple on-screen and Robin Williams makes for one hystical (and completely over-bearing) minister. May be slightly corny during some parts, but overall a fun and smile-inspiring movie. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
4,Very Funny,"I thought that this movie was adorable. It's not Oscar-worthy, but it's not supposed to be. Anyone who gives this movie a ""terrible"" rating was expecting too much. Overall, I found it to be very funny!"
2,Let this one set on the shelf,"If you are reading this review, you are probably thinking that this movie may be worth while seeing, it has robin williams. Not so. HE could not even save this completely disasterous movie. This follows the trail of a couple who get engaged at her parent's 30th anniversary party, then find out to use the ""family"" church to get married, they only have 3 1/2 weeks to do so, or it is wait 2 years. During this 3 weeks, they have to pass the pre-marital class ran by the ""reverend"" played by Robin Williams.The chemistry of the couple is not believeable, the extent that the reverend goes to is so far fetched it's not funny, and the script has numerous holes/flaws (please see many of the other reviews, so i won't have to rehash). I'm glad I rented this rather than seeing it in the theater. Even one for robin williams loyalists to skip. No wonder MSN ranked this Worst movie of the year."
2,the movie may be better for you than it sounds?,"The theme seems to be that people many times really don'tknow each other well enough when they get marriedand as a result marriages don't last.The family preacher or priest was traditionally the one to go tofor marriage counseling. This movie has the preacher from hellmaking the lives of the people he is supposed to be helpingmiserable. The motivation and the result of this movie seems to be two different things.The spying, conniving preacher and his alter boy might be funnyin another universe, but in this movie they are terrifying?The movie is very bad for organized religion too?You get feeling really sorry for the clueless couple."
5,License To Wed - Funny,In my opinion this movie was just as funny as The Heartbreak Kid. They are both hilarious.
1,License to wed--,just didn't like this movie. It wasn't funny. It was stupid. Who lets a blindfolded woman drive? Who counsels people to break them up so they can stay together? Robin Williams use to be funny and a descent actor but his movies are filled with so much crude that you have to wash off after you watch them! Robin Williams's imitation of a priest is less than par. There some funny parts but not enough to warrant a watch of this movie.
1,GIANT DISAPPOINTMENT,"I so wanted this film to be great because I really like John Krasinski from The Office. He does a good job with what very little there is here. And he is the only likable character in the film. He must have thought this was a dream project on paper.However, the film is badly written, not funny, it's just a mess.Moreover, Robin Williams character isn't believable or likable at all. And Many Moore is ugly. She's a person who gains a little weight (she appears about 25 lbs heavy here) and she ages very badly and gets very dense looking on film. She goes from some girl-next-door type to more of chubby bullyish self-serving stereotypical American I-deserve-everything type the rest of the world has come to abhor.YIKES!"
5,"A comedy, not a how to video","I am not sure what some of the people writing negative views were thinking. You really shouldn't have to comment that this is not an actual ""how to"" video, narrating an actual marriage prep (if you expect it to, you will be disappointed). It bears no resemblance to an actual catholic marriage prep, if it did there wouldn't be a priest involved, there are too few left. Anyway. This is a hysterical and farcical look at marriage prep and marriage in general. The priest (Robin Williams) and his little ""helper"" are hysterical. Those commenting how it is unrealistic, of course it is, it is a comedy! If your underwear is not on too tight and you want a laugh out loud movie, then you should get this. If you want a documentary on marriage prep or a completely realistic narrative, go somewhere else! Have fun and enjoy!"
3,"Funny, but not funny enough","I ordered this from my Tivo using Unbox, I'm glad I did, it was only 99 cents for the weekend. It's a good little flick, not one of Robin William's best work of course, but enjoyable."
2,Boring,"Happy to see Robin Williams in comedy again... not happy to see him or this ""Office"" reject idea"
2,Useless.,"License to Wed is a complete and utter disaster. The dialogue is corny, the acting is over-done, and the plot is 100% inane. Mandy Moore always does her best but she can't make a movie work like other stars. Robin Williams looks like he hated filming this movie, and that dude from The Office has some great facial expressions but he looks uninspired as well. Defintely not one to add to your media collection, this one is pretty bad."
1,What a Waste of Time,"I love Robin Williams, but not in this movie. He wasn't funny and neither was the movie. I think the writers were trying but they seemed to have missed the mark. It wasn't even like it was over the top funny. Just a flat movie. Don't waste your time."
1,"Horrible, just horrible","I rented this on sale, and even for less than $1 it's not worth it. There's one comedic moment in the middle of the film but the rest is just dumb. Stay away from this movie! Note to Unbox: my wife and I would like that 90 minutes of our lives back."
4,Save $ buy DVD instead,"Funny movie, seen it twice, but, Blu ray quality not quite there. Save some money buy DVD on movies like this where there isn't any explosions, and fast action scenes, fighting/driving."
1,Lame,"We saw this movie as part of a double feature at a drive-in. It was horrible. Frustrating, uncreative, not funny, and inappropriate. Waste of time."
1,To wed,"This movie sucked. It looked like it was really funny on the previews but it wasn't at all. Some scenes were ment to be funny but they just wern't. If you haven't seen this yet, don't bother."
2,I would not buy this again,"There were some funny parts but it is not a movie I want to keep nor buy again. The movie moved around too much and it seemed to be about a couple arguing more than it was about comedy. You can make a movie about anything and it will sell if the idea is original and directed well to deliver importance on theme, plot and perforance. But while the movie was watchable it was not a movie I would keep. It was okay but I just think it was not the best. It just has too much going on in the movie and it didn't make you wanna watch it again after you were finished. It was a typical love movie with comedy and you could almost predict the end of the movie which for the audience spells out boring and over done."
4,The Reverend Robin!,"This movie had a lot of chuckles in it even though the story was a little hard to believe. The minister played by Robin Williams requires all couples to go through a pre-nuptial class that is on the same par as boot camp! The most compelling rule is: no sex! How does he know the couple is abstaining--he has his nerdy assistant bug the bedroom while Ben and Sadie are at the marriage class! Then there is the twin dolls complete with bodily functions that are put in their care to see if they are up to the task of parenting. The reverend Frank really becomes too much a part of their lives with all the surveillance from the van, engaging them in role playing, and the list goes on and on. Even though this story line was a bit over the top, Robin Williams really did his utmost to make it really funny with all the one-liners and extreme wit for which he's famous. It's another movie to watch if you want something light and just a good laugh!"
2,Love it or hate it,"As you can tell from previous reviews, either you will love this or hate it. Musically, the songs are excellent, but Bill's voice is thin with little range. Stylistically, the album is reminiscent of Beggar's Banquet-era Stones. Lyrically... well, if you thought Mick was the horny Stone, you'll change your mind with one listen to this. Sexual innuendo and double entendres are rife throughout. Overall, is it any wonder Bill's songs were rejected for Stones albums? Buy this with caution - it's not going to blow you away on the first listen."
2,The Proof,"Bill released this when he became dissatisfied that Mick & Keith always rejected his songs. Here's the proof that Mick & Keith were right. Bill attempts a Stonesy, country-rock record reminiscent of his good friend, Ronnie Lane. He should have asked Ronnie for help on this one. Whether or not the songs are really any good, the fact remains that Bill is not and never will be a singer. Stick to playing the bass, Bill."
3,good but not that great,"I purchased this DVD with the intention of visiting a band that I never got to see live back in the good ol days, do their thing for their appreciative audience. It was a little disappointing. I have yet to make it all the way through the DVD at one sitting. Individually, I like all three of the main guys in the band, Jack Blades, Tommy Shaw, and Ted Nugent. And a couple of their hits were pretty good. But there just isn't that much to recommend this DVD. Its all pretty average. Its also annoying to have the interview and ""band hanging out"" segments sandwiched between the songs in the concert. So I would recommend this to the diehard Damn Yankee fan but everyone else would probably be happier just renting it once or looking for clips on the internet."
1,Terrible packaging,The insert for this DVD was not properly aligned behind the plastic so when the security sticker was placed on it was stuck to the insert. Of course when I removed the sticker it ripped off all the print on that section of the insert. Ridiculous. How hard is it to put an insert properly in a DVD case. I returned it. The content of the DVD was not the problem.
2,Ted Nugent is not worth the price,"I must admit up front that I am a life long Tommy Shaw fan and as such I had strong reservations about the pairing of Tommy and Ted Nugent before the band even had a name.This video is flacid. The song selection is terribly lacking as very few of their best works are featured here. MYSTIFIED, DOUBLE COYOTE and others should have been included instead of the solo material. Of particular note is how Terrible Ted steals the lead guitar solo for RENEGADE from the author himself, Tommy Shaw.The MTV style filming is embarrassing (though Tommy is more chagrined by his recollection of wearing DOC MARTIN boots) and the music itself is shallow and staid. Never do the boys really stretch out and showcase their incredible talents (except for guitar solos by Ted.)I saw the band in concert on several occasions. This DVD is little more than a reminder of what a DAMN YANKEES concert was like back in the early 90's."
5,Better than I expected,This dvd is truly better than I expected it to be. The individual performances by the band members and the overall sound quality was exceptional. I am an avid dvd music fan and collector. This one is now one of my favorites. This is a must get for Ted Nugent and Tommy Shaw fans. The other 2 band members are very good as well.... enjoy!!
5,A nice spark plug,"It's a spark plug. Not much Exciting about it. Being a double platinum, thus having a small platinum disc on the electrode and ground strap, they should last a very long time."
2,Wrong item,It was not what I was looking for. i wanted heart monitor type and thought that;s what I had ordered. Will probably return.
4,Simple yet fuctional,Simple sports watch with all the needed features. It was inexpensive. The only issue is the watch band is made of a hard plastic that does not mold to your wrist as nicely as some other sports watch bands but overall happy with this product.
5,Good Casual Watch,"I purchased this watch because I needed a cheap casual watch to use for travel. The watch actually looks more stylish in person than it does in the picture. I haven't had any problems with it. It is easy to set the different time zones, alarms etc."
4,Basic but Reliable,"This watch doesn't have all the options but is easy to use and for $15 you can't beat it. Recommend for those wanting a cheap, dependable, basic watch."
1,Stopped buying armies,"I've been buying Timex for swimming for years. But the last two I bought convinced me to find another brand. One watch (women's, under $20), has never allowed me to change the time. The other one worked for about a year but now it also won't allow time change. Very disappointed because they used to be great watched for casual wear."
3,buttons are hard to push,"I wanted a watch with larger digital numbers and a timer and this watch has both. I really enjoy it and my only dislike is that sometimes the buttons are hard to push. Otherwise, it's great."
2,Difficult to use,I liked a lot shape and it looks wonderful on hand but I'm not able to adjust according to the domestic tried a lot of ours did not work any attemptThe attached paper explains with No media without the benefit
1,"I hate this purchase, because it is a copy,mention it as Timex, but it is a horrible copy.","I hate this purchase, because it is a copy,mention it as Timex, but it is a horrible copy.on any side says it Timex brand, and comes only a sticker that says neither is brand Timex.(I realize this is a horrible copy because I have one that if Timex brand)"
1,Caused a severe rash,"Within 24 hours of wearing this watch after it arrived I incurred a severe rash on my arm and my arm swole up. I tried rinsing the watch and it didn't help. It takes about 2 days for the rash to dissapear, and as soon as I wear the watch again, the rash returns within minutes. Contacted Timex, but no response."
3,Es bueno,"Luce bien, no es tan facil de usar, hay que leer las instrucciones, no es de los que le empiezas a picar los botones y te das cuenta como funciona. Pagas por lo que te venden."
2,Not what I wanted,"Great price for this watch, but I needed a calorie counter and it doesn't include this feature. Want to return it."
2,What arrived was not what I wanted,"When I asked for a pedometer, the answer presented by Amazon were clocks and a clock was sent."
3,Good watch - non-water resistant,"Watch is good, but don't get it wet. The bottom label says water resistant for 50 feet - lie. Get something better."
5,Perfect watch for me!,"I bought this watch primarily for running/working out so that I could use the stopwatch feature. The watch arrived quickly and is exactly what I have been looking for. The watchband is very comfortable on my wrist, even while sweating during a workout. The face of the watch is not too big to where it looks huge on my wrist, but still large enough to easily read the display. I like how it has a seconds counter showing when you have it set to just show the time. Allows for easy minute interval training or checking heart rate without having to use the actual stopwatch. Even that is easy with just a touch of the button. I find myself wearing the watch all the time now! Have taken it swimming in the pool, ocean, shower etc with no problems. Very satisfied with this purchase."
4,good watch,"Pretty much what I expected, having owned Timex sports watches before. Clear display, 24-hour clock option (though I couldn't find it until it WAS afternoon). Light and time display size are large enough that I can see the time without my glasses. Instructions are clear and operation is fairly intuitive without them.Grey band is a nice neutral. The only real downside: the plastic is hot, which doesn't help during exercise. I find myself removing the watch from my wrist sometimes. And it's a special band so I can't even replace it."
1,New Watch?,I have had numerous watches but never bought one in which the battery was dead when I got it. Guess they can pull this when you buy online. Few people will bother sending back a watch because the battery is dead. Guess this is what you call poor quality control. Will remember this in the future and think twice about buying something that needs to run when I get it. Don't appreciate having to buy a battery right a way.
1,Fogged up and stopped working after 3 months!,"Granted, this is not an expensive watch... BUT, it fogged up and the display became unreadable after just 3 months of use. I never took this watch into water. Any moisture would have been sweat from my arm while running which generally happens to a running watch. And I'm not even that serious of a runner. Next time I'll buy something a little higher quality."
5,I love this watch,I really love this watch i wear it everywhere you can't even tell that it's on your arm
5,GREAT,The watch was exactly what was displayed. And the description was very accurate. Very please with my purchase. Thank you
3,The crystal tends to fog up...,"The band doesn't adjust down very far, so if you're looking for a girl's watch, this probably isn't for you. The specs say it can get wet, but when ours gets wet, the crystal fogs up the rest of the day. Otherwise, it's a decent watch."
1,Not waterproof as advertised...,"I'm sure this watch works fine if you don't really expect it to be waterproof, or sweat proof, and if you don't live in a humid country. I owned mine for about two weeks before steam collected behind the glass. By week four it stopped working entirely (even though I took it off in the shower, etc.).Additionally, if you're a runner and plan to use the timers and use the stop watch functions, those can be difficult because of the ridiculous number of buttons you have to push. That wasn't too big a problem for me and I would have given the watch 3 stars based the utility of the buttons... if it hadn't stopped working entirely after 4 weeks."
4,Great watch for the price.,"I needed something that was a little stronger and water proof for summer months for gardening and outdoor things over my dressy watches, and this has taken a beating and still looks great. I love the light thing at night, works great for camping! The timer and alarm has also come in quite handy so overall a great purchase, even if pink is far from my favorite color."
4,Timex Watch,"The watch itself is a little larger than I wanted. It is very thick and catches on the cuffs of my clothing. I was looking for a sport watch that was more simple in style and a bit smaller and thinner. Other than the size, it apprears to be a good watch.The service I received from the sender was great. It arrived in perfect shape and on time."
4,Nice watch,"I like this watch. I'm not a ""gadget person"" but I was able to figure out how to set the time and the alarm on this watch without any problems. It's small enough to still look like a women's watch but has the features of most men's watches."
4,Not a pedometer watch,"I like the watch! Great price for the money, but it didn't have a pedometer and it kept coming up on the pedometer watch search. I will keep it to track my running, but that's about all it does other than keep the time. If you are looking for a sporty time keeping watch then this is for you!"
4,A little difficult to set,"Loved this little watch when i saw it, and as much as I snorkel and swim, love the idea of I will have a time piece that is waterproof. The shipping was so fast. The only thing was.... it was a little difficult to first set up, but after that was done, no problem. The first day out, went to the beach and had this on, Totally loved this product! Will have a time piece for the beach for years to come afterall it is a timex...takes a licken and keeps on tickin!!!"
3,Useful,"It is very cute, the only negative point is that is not a true timex watch, but it is very useful."
1,Wow,Picked up a broken package from the ups store after waiting on line for four hours and imagine my surprise when there was nothing in the box priceless
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"I have had this watch for just over a month and it is completely dead. How do I know I've had it for just over a month? Because I seem to have just missed the window to return it. I am still trying to find a way to do so because there is absolutely no way this watch should be dead already - I only wore it to go running a few times a week and it never got wet other than a few drops of my sweat and it sat on a dry counter the rest of the time. I will replace the battery if I can't return the watch, but that will cost about as much as the actual watch and be a pain in the butt and I'm not convinced that it won't just fry a new battery in a month too. I read many positive reviews of this product before purchasing it, so I was surprised it turned out so crappy. It is totally possible I just got a lemon and it is a fine product most of the time, but I thought I should share my experience as I've never had even a cheap watch like this die so quickly."
4,simple but good,"I had a watch just like this in a different color that I use to time my runs. I don't need anything very complicated, and so I didn't want to pay a lot for bells and whistles that I wouldn't really use. This year, my sister wanted a watch for when she goes running, and so I got her the same model as mine for Christmas -- it's very simple, but works well."
4,Cheap and cheerful,I've had this for about a month. Have been in light rain and it still works. I wouldn't take it swimming.It works fine. Great to take on vacation especially in a plane when you want to know what time it is but your cell phone is turned off. My husband sets it for me since I have little patience for that kind of thing. He doesn't seem to have a problem with it. I don't expect it to last for a long time. I guess I have low expectations and with a watch that costs only $13.50 I think that's a good thing. I do recommend it.
2,NOT water resistant,"Bought this in June 2009. Wore it off and on for 6 months. Took it on a cruise in December, had it in the ocean for less than an hour and it started to die. The inside was fogged up with condensation and within 2 hours the watch was completely non functional. I was in less than 2 feet of water. Although Timex will fix the watch for $8 if you pay for shipping, it's probably worthwhile to spend more on a better watch. Also a bad thing about this watch is that you can't ever turn off the ""Beep"" when you switch between functions."
5,Love this watch!,"I wear it all of the time! It is waterproof, and so, I wear it in the shower, and out. It is my definite 'every day watch.' I think the colors are nice, and it's cute!"
4,What I expected - nice watch,I had a similar watch but it was lost through the years. Same button structure/organization.I started running and needed/wanted a stopwatch.My only complaint is the band. The cloth version I had previously fit perfectly; however this band is just off for my wrist. It's either too tight or too loose.But for a watch under $15 - I'll take it!
1,Not a good deal,"I've only had my watch a few months when the knob for the LED light fell off, then today water got inside it and condensation built up. So much that I can't even read the time. I guess I got what I paid for. Won't be buying this watch again."
3,Confused,"It's everything it says it is, but I'm having trouble remembering how to use it. I will with time, thanks."
4,Great watch for the price,"I have had the watch for two weeks and it is comfortable to wear. My wrist is small, but I like the size as well as the timer feature. It's nice that it is water resistant when I wash dishes, etc... ."
4,Like it!,"This watch is simple to use. It times, it has an alarm. I use it for track intervals. This is the second same watch I've bought. I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that the band sometimes breaks (and why I had to replace it). But it's great: simple, easy to use, and comfortable."
2,Disappointing,"I've worn Timex watches for years - love all the features. This one is set up differently than the others, and at first, I just thought that was annoying because I had to learn a different way to set things up, but now even after reading the directions, I can't get the date set. It's a less expensive watch than the others, and while I like the look fine, it's been disappointing. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand the directions, but it shouldn't be this hard. I won't send it back because i didn't pay much for the watch and it's not worth the hassle, so I'll still wear it to the gym."
2,Scratches on screen,I have had the watch for less than a month and it already has several scratches on the screen. The scratches are so bad that I have to tilt the watch in just the right way so that I can read the time.
1,The minutes will not set,"This is a really cool looking watch and although the hour will set, the minutes will not set. I have been through the instructions many times, looked for instructions on google and on youtube. I follow the instructions to the tee and it simply won't work. A watch that will not set is worthless."
4,Good watch for beginning training,"I like this watch. I have begun to train for a 5K and this is a readable timepiece that has a stopwatch function, so you are able to time yourself. It has other functions (day, date, etc.)which are also clear to read which makes it good for wearing everyday, too. As a sport watch, it meets my needs perfectly."
3,It's a watch. What do you want?,"I'm buying another one because my last one was pinched. It gets only 3 stars because it's smarter than me. Seriously. Haven't a clue what all those buttons are for. Major cool points, though. I like it a lot."
5,Color,"Oh Bl**dy H***. It's pink. I thought it was red. My second watch of this model. Very, very good watch. If the price is considdered as well it's an excellent watch."
2,VERY stiff buttons. Beware.,"I got this for my son. Of all ~12 timex ironman watches I have owned in my lifetime, this has the very stiffest buttons. They leave a red mark on your fingers when you finally push hard enough to operate them!!! I won't even bother to set this watch for my son, i'll only touch it if I need to turn off the alarm at 4:00 AM. THE WORST USER INTERFACE OF ALL MY TIMEX WATCHES.It's good if you don't plan to push the buttons !!!"
2,Not so water resistant,"I have had several Timex watches. I love that they are inexpensive and can wear them into water and they last for years. I bought this one to replace an old one that still worked after many years, the strap had just broken! My old watch I would never have to take off to go into a pool at all. This one had about 1 month and got water inside it after going into a pool. It still works, but it's not really usable anymore, it's got water on the inside that is fogging up the front of it."
5,Like the fit and look,"I am not wearing the watch in the water(did once for triathlon), but it seems to be holding up fine after a month. Like the fit for my wrist (very small) I usually have a hard time with sports watches being to large and overlap of the strap, not with this one. Very happy with size of numbers to read and the styling."
2,Can't set the Darn thing,"I've followed the instructions many times and I can't set the time or date accoding to the instructions. I've looked up the instructions online and found diffferent variations for the same watch. Either this watch is just broke, or none of the instructions are right? I wasn't expecting to have an issue so I didn't save the Box container, or package slip needed to return it, Dumb Me."
5,"Great Watch for Nurses, Radiation Therapists, Techs, etc.!","I LOVE this watch!! If you're looking for something comfortable, waterproof (through all those hand washings), and reasonably priced...this is the watch for you. Well worth the asking price, and I love the digital seconds countdown - perfect for pulse and respirations!!! Super cute and stylish and not too wide."
5,Great item.,"2nd time buying this product.My daughter loves it .The price was good compare to Target. 5 stars , great gift !"
4,Satisfied!,Use this product in coaching volleyball and run drills. Very easy to use and serves as dual function. Excited to take to tournaments and use there as well. Timex as always is a great product!
4,Functional attractive basic sports watch,"I like the relatively large face on this watch and the pink accents on the silver face, which add a touch of femininity to the watch. It is easy to set, especially if you've had another digital watch. The stopwatch works well, and I really like the Indiglo light. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the timer is useless. There is no ""reset"" button for the timer so you have to cycle through the minutes and seconds back to zero to reset. This is very annoying. However, I don't use a timer very often so it really doesn't affect the functionality of the watch for me. For the price, and if you don't use a timer, this is a good choice."
4,Comfortable,"It's very light, I barely notice it on my wrist. The method of setting it is not intuitive, I actually had to read the directions, which is something I haven't had to do with a watch in many years."
5,this is my favorite watch of all time,"I only bought this one because my first Timex 1440 watch's band broke. I have had that one for over 10 years and hope this one does as well. That said, if I could find a band for my other one, I'd be overjoyed to have two.. I have encountered more than one person who is sporting the SAME watch & happy with it."
3,Good watch for the price.,This was my swim and tennis watch and it works well for that purpose. Not very stylish and doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles - only the standard functions etc.
5,Great watch,"I work in the veterinary field, and needed something comfortable that can take some abuse. I've had this watch for a few years now, and it still works great. The tab which holds the excess watch band down did actually just break, which is not a big deal to me. I would still buy it again!"
5,Cheap but good,"I know that you can spend a lot of money for a watch like this - with multiple features, etc. I wasn't looking for many options, but this watch seems to work fine and is able to do multiple things. I generally just use it for accurate time-keeping (and date and use of ""light-up"" features). I also really like the colors. The watch looks like it does in the picture. It's a great price, too."
3,nice watch,"Good price, in store, sell at 14USD or more, quick delivery, only problem is hard band material. At this price range, I call it a good watch."
4,Great basic watch with all the features you need,"I love this watch. This is the second one of the same watch that I have purchased. The first one lasted a little over two years, including a year in Honduras before the wristband broke. I liked it so much the first time I bought the same watch again after it broke. The watch is easy to use and holds up pretty well to harsh conditions. The water resistance feature is great. I could do dishes and even went swimming with the watch on a few times and never had any issues.The only thing I didn't really like about the watch is that the screen scratches fairly easily but I also wasn't very careful to try to prevent that. Even when the screen was a little scratched it was still pretty easy to read the display.Overall a great product that I would recommend to anyone looking for an easy to use, simple sports watch with a several features."
2,Water resistance is futile,"Though advertised as water resistant to 50 meters, a depth of one meter was sufficient to fog up the interior of the crystal. And although I didn't expect an actual crystal at this price point, the plastic used is rather easily scuffed. Glad it only cost $15 or so..."
4,Swimmer,"I found the watch comfortable to wear, easy to read in the dark, but found it difficult to set the current time. Buttons too small for my finger or maybe my finger is too big for the buttons. Other than this, it's a great deal."
5,My Mother Loves It,"My mother wanted a cheap little watch that she could wear around the house, and so I bought her this. She loves it because it has a light, its a stop watch and other things that help her with her daily errands and chores. So I guess it was worth every penny."
2,good/bad,"I bought this watch before and loved it, but lost it. So I bought another one. I've had it six months...it now beeps continuously and there is condensation on the inside of the face-although waterproof? Very dissapointed as the last one lasted years. Maybe I just got a bad one."
3,start stop button easy to bump,"I just bought this watch to use as a countdown timer for bike racing. It is easy to use and read, but what i realize is that the location of the start/split button is easy to bump. It was stopped when I didn't want it to be and I had to restart it. The next time I looked at it it was stopped again. Not good when you're trying to time something. I tried four times and each time I looked at it it was stopped. I think for running it is probably fine, but for activities where it might get bumped it's no good. I am going to try to take it back and get something with a start/reset button that is more difficult to bump."
4,"""Sing Out"" the money in your pocket","If you don't already have this CD, get it now!!!!. This is Ron Kenoly's second greatest CD, next to ""God Is Able."" If you donate money to any kind of charity (i.e. Christian Children's Fund), then you will love the appearence of the African Children's Choir in the CD and VHS. I think you should buy this immediately if you don't already have it."
3,High Maintenance shoe,"These are adorable and cute enough to wear with party dresses which was my intention, however.... my daughter was so excited when she saw them I let her wear them ONE day to school to show her friends. It was a regular day of school, no gym, no playground after and she is in kindergarten so not alot of walking around the halls. She came home and all the sequins on the toes were twisted and several were missing. A big dissappointment from such an expensive brand. Now I need to replace all the missing sequins or go buy another pair of party shoes :0("
3,Comfy but sequins fall off,"Bought these for my daughter, and she says they are comfortable and fun/sparkly; however many of the sequins have already fallen off the toes, so they look a little run-down after only a couple of weeks. Thought it may be better quality than that."
2,Great for Short Trips. Limited Functionality.,"This garment bag feels rather cheap initally but proved for be durable for the torture I put it through. I could only comfortably fit about 2-3 suits in a single bag, which was not good for a several week trip which had a baggage limit. There is no easy way to lock the bag if you decided to do so. Having been used to a stationary hook on garment bags, I was easily aggervated by this bag not having one as well.I would have rather spent the money on a larger, more functional bag."
5,Love it,"I have to say, this is my favorite grilling cook book. It is simple to read and follow. It is great for a cook that is starting off or with a ton of experience."
3,Caught up in the middle...,"I wish I could give this one 3.5 stars, because it's better than just average, but not AS great as 4.The opening track ""Hole in the Head"" was a great one to release as the first single, but as the album goes on, it kind of dwindles until ""Conversation's Over,"" one of the group's best downtempo ballads. The following track ""In the Middle"" is quite possibly my favorite Sugababes song ever! I can't get enough of it! ""Too Lost in You"" takes it back downtempo and into ballad territory, and again the album dies off afterward until the end of the album. The tracks that stick out are nothing short of amazing, but the others that are a little sub-par just kind of blend in together.Overall, I *WOULD* recommend this album, however I think this isn't their greatest work. If you want better-quality Sugababes, I'd go for Taller In More Ways."
1,Banzai Girl a must buy!,"Well this Trade Paperback is wonderfully illustrated by Jinky Coronado its about her real life adventures as a school girl but exaggerated. It is a fun story as you see the cute Jinky facing off against various monsters. If you like beautiful girls, action and adventure with some thrills and chills mixed in you'll enjoy the adventures of Jinky and her friends."
4,Great for High Detail Artwork,"We had an order to produce about 100 CDs that had some high definition graphics as part of the CD label. Regardless how we tried the artwork did not come though with its full brilliance and definition when we used even the best photo quality matte finished labels. The producer then decided to give this product a try and we were all very pleased with the results.The photo quality showed up very well once we started using these labels. Also, these labels are a bit thicker and seemed to apply to the CDs a bit easier than some of the other types of CD labels. What was most important is that the client was very pleased with the result.Overall we give it 4 out of 5 only because we could not find a source from which to purchase them in quantity with the appropriate price break if we should need them again. For the price, they are great for short runs but if one is doing a large run then these are a bit pricey."
2,Look great...BUT......,"..the real test of these labels is to try and insert the cd they've been applied to, into your cars cd player. In every instance they either wouldn't go in....or couldn't come out and and got stuck! They look great if your using them for your computer, but i don't recommend using them for your cars cd player."
1,WASTED MONEY,I received the labels on time but they were so badly damaged that they would not go through my printer. This was MONEY WASTED!
2,Not as advertised,"This product was not as advertised. It claimed to contain paper CD holders as well as labels but did not. Thus, it was higher priced than it should have been."
3,Sounds a Bit Corny,"This CD is only okay. The sound of the keyboard they used sounds pretty corny, and doesn't sound like real instruments. But is still fun to have!"
2,"""The woman whose warmth consumes""","In the Mountain Greenery, Where God Paints the Scenery, a few unlikely people converge. The future of our galaxy depends on what they do. One of them (Shirley Kilpatrick) is out of this world. She seems to want to get you and your little dog too. Could her actions be misinterpreted? Watch and find out.This film has a lot of time filler and can be fast forwarded during the scenes where everyone is creeping around outside in the bushes at night with a searchlight on them and cheap music in the background.I saw this on DVD but it looks like a poor transfer. The only DVD extra is the trailer."
1,it deserves no star.,"This movie is so bad,I sold it as soon as possible. Dont buy it if your expecting something great like plan nine from outer space."
2,Inferior print,"For some reason Image Entertainment used a different print for their DVD version as opposed to their earlier VHS release.I have this film on both media and the print used for the VHS is cleaner, with the exception of a loss of dialogue occurring at the thirty-eight-minute-mark due to an abrupt splice/jump in the film. The line of dialogue is clean and clear on the DVD. For those who only own or have seen the VHS the dialogue delivered by Nat, the lead kidnapper is as follows: ""It's a synch someone survived because that thing wasn't from this world.""You would think that Image would at least use a print as good or better than what they previously used for their VHS release. Kind of defeats the whole purpose of the DVD format to use lower grade source material on a higher grade of media."
1,"Ow, my brain","I would eat a bowl of rusty fish hooks before I would watch this movie again. Please don't spend your money on this tripe, give it to an alcoholic panhandler instead."
1,dissappointed,i thought it was a steven seagal movie he is metion as an actor in it if he is there at all i did not see him
4,Perfect size for me...,This product is pretty decent quality for the price. And it is not very wide so it fits in in tight places.
1,Poor quality furniture,"This table arrived with a broken drawer and pieces that didn't fit together very well. There were gaps where the legs connected to the top, and the bottom shelf was too small to connect to more than two legs at a time. Fortunately, the return/refund process was painless--I found the return section quickly and easily on Amazon and I received a full refund within days, without a trip to the post office, and with very little navigation around the site."
3,"A nice guide for white, but lacking in the black side","I am disappointed by this book. A few months ago I got very excited about the Sicilian Kan openning and was dying to try it in competition, and was looking for a good book to guide me through the learning curve. With this book, I expected a lot considering the 5 stars that it has received in the previous two reviewers. However, from black's point of view, I believe John Emms book is severely lacking in content. It appears to me that the author is clearly more biased for the white pieces rather than the black's point of view, which is seen by the substantial analysis given from white's perspective. I am going to buy the Ali Mortazavi book on the Kan, hopefully it will give me a more balanced view on this new and dynamic openning. If you want to learn on how to beat the Kan openning, buy this book, but if you want to win with it, better save your money on something else."
5,Our Favorite Bedtime Story,"My daughter is 7 months old, and this has been her favorite book for at least 2 months. She immediately smiles and laughs when I begin reading the story to her every night (because we do read it _every_ night!). Several people have commented on the colors of the illustrations being too monochromatic, but I think that is part of the appeal. Some of her other books have very busy illustrations and I think are too much for her to take in. But the large blocks of color in Moo Moo Brown Cow are easy for her to focus on and she loves it. I would highly recommend this book!"
1,Disappointed,"This is a board book - the first 3 pages were bent and broken, there was scribbling throughout. The condition of this book was less than acceptable and not worth the cost of postage. I have purchased many used books for the same price ; none have been this badly battered."
4,Cute!,"Jakki Wood, <strong>Moo Moo, Brown Cow</strong> (Red Wagon Books, 1991)Cute counting book for the pre-reader set with a couple of odd choices in both illustration (oddly, the cat doesn't show up in a couple of pictures) and animal choice (no real way to illustrate the final page without leaving out some of the other animals). However, I don't think the pre-reader set is going to notice either, and truthfully, most parents probably won't, either. ***"
4,"GOod book, bad color","This book captured the attention of my 4 year old right away. It was because the concept is simple yet brilliant combination of rhyme, baby animals, color, numbers which all young children adore.The only problem with the book is the color of the illustrastions. For example the white duck was yellow. Sometimes you can barely make out the baby animals because the foreground and background colors were very close. But my son LOVES it."
5,A Pictures is Worth a Thousand Words,D&K; is a great way to visualize & plan all of our trips to Europe. Rick Steves is fine (I also bought it) but he never give me a sense of the overall look and feel of the locations that we will visit.I have great interest in fine art and based on what is illustrated in D&K; Germany I've added the StaatsGalerie (in Stuttgart) to our upcoming trip to Germany.
5,DK does it again,"I think DK Publishing is one of the outstanding publishers of travel books. They cover transportation, lodging, dining and a lot of other things that travelers so desperately need when they are away from home."
3,eyewitness/DK guides have beautiful photos,"I was just looking for more information on cities along the Rhine River and this book, though beautiful for most of Germany, didn't have the information I was seeking."
4,One of our favorite Travel Guides,"I love the DK Eyewitness Travel Guides for several reasons: color photos, background/history, maps/drawings of destinations, color coded sections, front and back flaps can be used as page markers (plus that's where they put the symbols for the descriptions).My only dislikes are the weight (they can be hefty, use Rick Steve's advice on either tearing out what you need or, my preference, copy the pages you'll be using instead of lugging a heavy guide with you) and the author assumes we've all got loads of cash. I too, want out of the way places to stay and eat."
1,"Trained Woodworker 40 years experience, Guitar Maker, 15 years","This trimmer is terrible at any price. It's excessively noisy and it vibrates terribly. Worse yet, the locking knob on the base strips and fails within weeks. I had to fix mine by using a hose clamp. Grizzly offers some good things, but this is not one of them."
4,mind blowing colors and art,"""Colonel Bleep"" is said to be the first ever made for TV cartoon series to be made in color! Boy, what vibrant, bright, loud color! And what amazing art and design! Clever plots, too. ""Colonel Bleep"" is one of the very best cartoon series of the 1950s. There is a LOT of influence here on the art and style of ""Ren & Stimpy"". John K. and company were easily familiar with ""Colonel Bleep"" when making ""Ren & Stimpy"" and other cartoons. No doubt about it.I watched ""Colonel Bleep"" on TV (in black & white, of course) in the 1950s when I was not yet old enough to go to school. I never forgot this cartoon!The cartoons on this DVD have had little done digitally to clean up the picture and sound. Well-used films were the source here, not original negatives, for certain. Until something more definitive comes out, this DVD will be the one to have."
3,Nostalgia Strikes,"Colonel Bleep is even more primative than I remembered. I was less that 7 when I watched these in the 1950's. If your child demands sophistication in cartoons, skip this. I loved its simplicity. A caveman, a living wooden puppet, and a super science alien protector of our space sector, none of whom speak, make up the cast. The narrator provides all the verbal info. Give it to a small child whose sense of wonder is intact. This is for someone who likes Fred Rogers. It's sweet; it's simple, it's Spacey. Bleep has a lab and a cool island where he and his sidekicks live and their adventures begin. The characters and situations have signature sound effects that young kids will like."
4,Take me back!,"One of the earliest TV cartoons I can remember seeing. This is a good quality tape of one of the more original cartoon series I have ever seen. You must have seen the series as a child to get a full appreciation of this 'toon, but is a good, obscure, piece of American TV memorabilia."
4,Talk about crazy..,"The ""perp"" in this story is a real nut case. We never really learn why he's so obsessed with grandmother.....and as far as a newspaper reporter moving in with the ""Streeters"", I find that completely unbelievable. You'll keep on reading though just to find out how in the world this story will end. Don't worry about having nightmares from this book....it gos beyond scary to bordering on ridiculous......I gave it four stars because it is ...in spite of all my comments...an entertaining read."
1,Cat Loves Sponge Balls,"These sponge balls would be great, if the WorldofPups sent what they advertise.My cat loves sponge balls. I was really excited to see the variation of textures and these great blue and pink colors.However, the Worldofpups does not send you what is pictured. They sent me two 4-packs of the spotted sponge balls. I was very disappointed to not receive what they advertise."
3,Lots of Tunes for the Avid Fan,"This is a ""two fer"" CD which combines two LPs into one CD with a few bonus tracks added. Twenty seven tunes total is generous.There are a lot of covers on this CD, but I prefer the originals by the original artists. Unless you are an avid fan of Gary Lewis and The Playboys, I would recommend you purchase instead ""Gary Lewis and The Playboys"" - Legendary Masters Series which has 25 tunes including all the ones that were hit singles on the Billboard 100 except for ""Rhythm of the Rain"" which only peaked at Number 63. That tune also does not appear on this CD."
4,Charmed by Ludwig,"A great follow up book to ""Hotel Bemelmans"", the story telling is wonderful and you wish his adventures would never end. The only disappointment in the book is the fact that several of the stories from ""Hotel Bemelmans"" were repeated in this book."
1,Not going well so far....,"I've had this board about a week, and I haven't been impressed thus far.I wanted to set it up with a RAID 5 array for performance and data redundancy. Windows XP wouldn't install with this configuration, the installation would freeze while it was trying to copy files. I tried installing it on a RAID 0 and migrating to a RAID 5 after I had installed Windows, but the computer stopped responding after a few hours and I eventually had to format and start over.Also, when I installed the EasyTune overclocking utility, it caused the computer to freeze, and corrupted my windows/system/ folder, so that I have to start over and reinstall everything.Maybe it's a great board, I haven't gotten it to work for more than a day so I wouldn't know."
4,Not the Franchise,"It was only after I'd seen the film ""Pirates. . .IV"" that I was told the movie was somehow based on a book by Tim Powers, a fantasy author whose work I like a great deal. I bought and read the book, and have formed the opinion that basing a Pirates Franchise movie on it was a mistake. If one likes the Franchise (and I do!) the movie, while not up to the first three, is not at all bad. But Powers' book is far better, and should have been given its own film treatment without benefit of grafting Franchise characters (and others!) onto it. Powers' plotting is as satisfyingly complex as ever, and his refreshingly skewed viewpoint on various myth elements is definitely present. Both the film and the book are best enjoyed separately."
5,Terrific fun (pirates! voodoo! mayhem!),"Powers against demonstrates his vast knowledge of all things trivial in this fast-paced historical fantasy of piracy, voodoo and the hunt for eternal life.In all of his books, Powers creates an elaborate system of magic - generally a subjective one for each practitioner - but a system nonetheless. In On Stranger Tides, many of the prominent characters (including Blackbeard) use voodoo to achieve their goals - making for a dark (and slightly comic) adventure.A well-researched, entertaining and thoroughly bizarre book. One of my favorites from Powers (and that's saying a lot!)."
5,On Stranger Tides,"Powers is an exceptioanllu imaginatiove writer. If you've heard of voodoo, read this for a well thought-out piece on how it might work in an alternative place."
5,Johnny Depp to Star??,"I just read that the fourth ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film has been titled: ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides."" Since I LOVE this book (and all Tim Powers' novels), I'm wondering if the producers will adapt some of this brilliantly entertaining work around Johnny Depp's ""Jack Sparrow"" persona. I'm not a fan of the films-- in fact, they seem like rip-offs of this book, which precedes them by many years. But if it puts shekels in Powers' pockets and leads readers to this book and the rest of his oeuvre, then why not?Powers is in a class by himself, and this is one of his most accessible books-- if you haven't read it: READ IT."
3,Washed out video + Containing only 5 songs + NO SUBTITLES,"PRO- The sound quality is good.CONS- Most of the video scenes look washed out.- There's no SUBTITLES. Consequently, I can't sing along. This is the thing I hate the most.- There are only 5 songs on DVD. They are ""Yellow Moon"", ""Bird on a Wire"", ""Sister Rosa"", ""Fearless"" and ""Fly Like an Eagle""It's worth buying of you're a fan of the Neville Brothers. I bought it because of ""Bird on a Wire"" song. I love the song after watching the movie with the same title starring Mel Gibson."
4,"This may be short, but is simply outstanding. It's worth the cost just for the Video of ""Sister Rosa"". Definitely Worth the Buy!","This may be short, but it sure is great in my opinion, and well worth the price. The songs are great, the filming, the sound, everything is fantastic. It's well worth the purchase price, just for the video of ""Sister Rosa"" alone. In this video, they re-inact, the story of the legendary, civil rights heroin, Rosa Parks, and how she refused to give up her bus seat, to a white man, in Montgomery, Alabama, back during segregation. It shows how her refusal to give up her bus seat, lead to the Civil Rights movement, and how Dr.King took up her cause. It's a great video story, very well portrayed. Also, I really like ""Fly Like an Eagle"", this is the old Steve Miller song, and is performed very well by the Neville Brothers. I like this dvd, very much, and I gladly recommend it."
4,Good drive for the money,"Decent drive, plug and play in Windows 2000 with no additional drivers needed. It does what is intended (read DVDs and burn CDs), but it isn't particularly speedy, and the software is adequate. Basically a low cost bare-bones solution that is somewhat better than entry level."
5,IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN HORSES... A Great Gift Book!,"I really enjoyed DEAR DOLLY. Emily exposes her strengths and weaknesses in a humorous way, and in opening her farm and heart to us, we are offered hope in our own personal challenges. My 80 year old mother(who is terrified of horses) LOVED this book as well, it appeals to young and old, and will make a PERFECT gift book."
2,Great book to put you to sleep,"I know this isn't exactly an ""exciting"" subject, but the style of writing of this book was really dull. Just lots of boring facts jammed together into chapters. More info on the organization and building of the Volkssturm, than actual history of the different units. Also very little on it's arms, other than a lot of complaining about how difficult it was to obtain them."
1,Beat up little children,"Good grief, what a stupid book! Unless you want to create aggressive offspring, who turn into messed-up adults inclined to BDSM.Normal people don't feel the need to beat up little children with a ""ruler, wooden spoon, or small paddle"" like Pritchett does. Pritchett is an uneducated moron who shouldn't be writing books about children."
5,Kinky Porn For Kids Under 12,"This book must be a real turn on for some people! What a great idea -- writing ""lite"" S&M erotic literature in the guise of a ""parenting manual"" that doesn't have all the warnings about being age 21+ and doesn't need to have the libido-dampening disclaimer about ""this is entertainment for consenting adults only,"" ""spanking kids is wrong,"" etc. And I'll bet you can even get it in ""Christian"" bookstores! (I put ""Christian"" in quotes because it's pretty hard to imagine Jesus telling parents it's okay to have sexual activity -- let's call a spade a spade -- with kids..."
1,What kind of psycho is this woman?,"I would first like to address the fact that the author of this book (spelled author, not auther Ms. Pritchett) should perhaps learn to spell basic words like 'author' and 'encouraging' before she writes a book that she expects to be taken seriously. Furthermore, how can this woman's parenting tactics be considered helpful? Spanking and love are complete opposites. I can't imagine how someone could have written such a monstrous creation in a sane state. I hope Ms. Pritchett was on some kind of psychotropic medication."
1,Must read if you are the dominant type,"If you like the book ""How to beat your wife into submission."" then you will love this one. It too gives details about which items warrent a smack and when it is appropriate in the marriage. Must read!"
4,SPANKING GETS RESULTS,"I think this book is a good guide on how to discipline children. I am 16 years old, and three years ago, I was a disobedient 13 year old who was headed for trouble when my dad caught me hanging out with friends who were stealing and were doing practically anything they wanted to do. My dad was at his wits end when he bought Jamie Pritchett's book. Since he had already caught me on other occassions with these friends, he would give me no more chances, so when he brought home a paddle, we went to my room for a talk. He told me to remove my panties and bend over a chair. He gave me more than her recommended 5 whacks. He gave me 9 on my bare bottom. I cried like I never had before. Dad only had to spank me twice more with the paddle. I am glad he did it because that spanking saved me from getting into serious trouble. I recommend this book to other parents because I think children do need spankings when they are disobedient."
5,Lots of Love & a Spanking Review,"Lots of Love & a Spanking is an Excellent Look at REAL Parenting, we all know we are not perfect Parents, and we all know children are not perfect angels. And we all know that Spanking is part of Normal Childhood Development. Lots of Love & a Spanking is exactly what this book is about! I have an Associate's Degree in Child Development and I agree 100% with Jamie Pritchett's theories on Spanking a child and following it up with a Lot of love. My Suggestion to those who need Discipline suggestions, and have considered Spanking and are hesitant to buy this book is Stop Being Hesitant, if you believe in a good Spanking to your child once in a while, then BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Outstanding parenting book!,"Jamie Pritchett's book is an outstanding guidepost for the proper raising of children in the modern world. It teaches love and biblically based discipline. More parents would do well to read parenting books like this one, as opposed to the claptrap which steers away from spanking."
1,"Wow, unfortunately many people are ignorant parents","It's amazing how pro-spankers are so vehement about assaulting children. Unfortunately, they'll just call non-spankers liberals, when in fact we care how children are treated & speak up for injustice. If I can raise my 5 well-behaved children without hitting them, and my parents did this also.......why can't YOU? It's your problem. Deal with it for your kids sake. If you want to debate me, I have 9+ years of documentation on both sides for the subject. The evidence is conclusive, but unfortunately, most spankers are either too ignorant or lazy & would prefer to justify their violence instead of learning. When you KNOW better you DO better!"
1,Promoting the Oxymoron,"Love and hitting are antithetical. This author tries to make you think that the easy, violent approach to discipoline is loving. Hogwash. It isn't."
1,"Another ""Christian"" book promoting violent parenting","Yet another supposedly Christian view based book that promotes hitting children. Only for the brain dead, cultish, fetishist or lazy, violent parent.Avoid it."
1,A lot of crap,"I grew up being spanked on the bottom with the hand exactaly 3 times and i turned out okay. I luckly live in Germany,were spanking i totally forbidden since 2000 (good thing, even thought i don't find hand spanks so bad). Anyone who spanks their children with a ruler, paddle or wooden spoon is crazy to me! Whenever something else than the hand is used it isn't spanking anymore (to me) it's child abuse."
3,MISLEADING TITLE,"This is a quality Image DVD. The image is sharp and crisp. There are a few trailers and a chapter index.This movie is not science fiction. This movie was marketed wrong and still is. The Amazon reviewer writes, ""it's a strange mix..."" There really is no mix. There's no space station and very little of the rocket. This is a murder-mystery plain and simple and I think a pretty good one. The acting is good and the story good."
2,Review of the Spaceways film.,I thought that the science regarding what we now know as the space station was interesting. I did not think that the movie lived up to the description on the outside of the DVD case. I know that the actors have done much better work in other films and were not used to the best of their abilities.
3,Typical 50's space opera.,"Classic 50's sci fi adventures. Typcial technical effects, good writing for the day, good popcorn movie for a late Saturday night!"
3,"It`s a triller, not a sci fi movie.","In general it`s a little bit bouring, it`s not a scifi movie like others in his time. It`s more like a police suspence and triller.Just if you do`n`t have any more to do......"
2,Not as Expected,"Maybe it is me, but I realy expected the book to be more of a modern ""how to"". To me is is worthless and in need of an update or retirement. No one coulld build a clock or would want to from the pictures/drawings provided. It is an 1984 edition and very stale."
1,"Should've been called ""How to Build 35 Great Clock Cabinets""","Maybe I'm crazy, but I've always considered a clock to be the inner workings - springs, pendulums, and such. This book doesn't tell you how to build those - it is merely a woodworking book that talks about the design of the cabinets that house clocks. Not for a horologist."
3,"The title should have been ""how to build 35 great clock-cases"".","The book was rather disappointing in the sense that it does not give any information at all about building clocks. It tells you how to build CLOCK-CASES from wood. Withing these restrictions, the book indeed gives 35 nice examples for people who have a 'naked' clockmovement and who want to give this a house to live in. The drawings are clear. The parts-lists are very helpfull. The measures are imperial, so the normal (metric) part of the world will have to convert all sizes. Not a really difficult thing to do, but time-consuming. A conversion table from inches into centimeters, in an appendix, would have been helpfull. The price is moderate, for a book with so many drawings and figures (black and white). So once you are aware of the somewhat misleading title, is is still good value for money."
2,"Old book, bad pictures, ugly clocks, poor plans - but good history","This book provides a good history of clocks, but that is the nicest thing I can say about it.The pictures are of very poor quality, the plans are incomplete - ignoring details obvious on the original shown. The author seems to think nails and butt-joints are a good method of joinery. The author shows no knowledge of wood movement in the designs. Most of the clocks allow no method for accessing the quartz movement after construction - so it is impossible to change batteries.This is a good book to browse at the library, but when it comes to actually building clocks, keep looking."
2,not historically accurate,"if your looking for just general feel of the great clocks of old then it is ok, but I did not find any of the designs to be historically accurate. Even though he would show a picture along side the plans of a true Antique. I think this may be because the book was written in the early 80's as most of these plans seem to be coping. mainly the shaped edges. they were not traditional shapes but more the 80's rounded off corners. Also the joinery was sup par. For a beginner it is fine, but if your experienced pass on this dated work."
5,Excellent Resource,"I teach 7th grade Earth Science; even though this book is geared towards 3rd-6th grade, so many of the activities are useful demos and short hands-on activities to deepen the learning of my students.I love the set-up of the book: it is divided into the various divisions of Earth Science (astronomy, rocks and minerals, oceans, etc) and has a TON of experiments in each section. They are all easy to do; most use materials from around the house. The few that don't use materials that are easy to find at any store. Each experiment is supplemented by a simple, yet very clear illustration, easy-to-follow steps, and an explanation of why the experiment works the way it does.If you teach middle school, VanCleave's books are great to have!!"
2,Earth Science class,I was hoping for experiments that I could do with my kids. The experiments in this book are really just short demonstrations. Most of the experiments are so minimal and include things like ripping a paper towel to show how some minerals have a definite cleavage line or marking on a balloon and showing how the marks expand when the balloon is inflated. I don't think I will have much use for this book.
4,The best way to get better French,"One of the biggest impediments to learning a foreign language is the ability to *hear* that language spoken naturally and at normal speed by native speakers. The Practice and Improve tapes use total immersion in the format of an evolving story that gradually increases in speed and complexity. By employing different speakers from different regions (and characters with different socioeconomic backgrounds), you get a rich set of auditory distinctions. The story is interesting enough that you don't mind hearing it several times.My only criticisms are that the transcript and the learning guide are in two different books (awkward), and the music is getting a bit dated. This is NOT the set to go for if you want to learn advanced rules, structures and grammar.I recommend this set to anyone who has studied french, but wants to actually be able to speak it."
5,A Searing Indictment of U.S.' Relationship with Israel,"This book is a searing, well documented indictment of the relationship between Israel and the U.S. The author doesn&#146;t pull any punches. He says, &#147;Israel is not our ally,&#148; and then he proves it over and over again in his hard hitting 284 page expose&#146;. Every aspect of the relationship, viewed within a broad conspiracy context, is revealed. Abboud&#146;s open windows into areas usually closed to public view, where the interest of our Republic is continuously put at risk for the sake of Israel. The &#147;Invisible Enemy,&#148; Zionist Israel, is invisible no more, thanks to the hard work of Edward Abboud. All Americans who love their country, owe this intrepid author a debt of gratitude for writing this book."
3,pleasant enough debut,"Kris Neri has crafted a pleasant enough debut with ""Revenge of the Gypsy Queen."" Tracy Eaton, only daughter of a pair of narcissistic Hollywood screen legends, is a plucky and clever heroine. No silly scruples for her! She's a real find. The other characters -- particularly Uncle Philly -- are handled with just the right measures of wit and sympathy.Sure, the novel is funny; however, some of her madcap adventures are a bit unrealistic -- even for a farcical mystery novel. And you're certain to figure out the Eatons' secret halfway through the book. Indeed, most will figure out who the villain is before the exciting climax.Is this novel in the same league as Lindsey Davison's Falco series or Ann Granger's Markby and Mitchell series? Of course not. But it's still a nice novel to read in between the favorite installments of your favorite mystery series. Pleasant is good enough for me."
1,Hopelessly contrived plot; a waste of time,"This book was a huge disappointment. It wasn't particularly funny, and the plot was hopelessly contrived and convoluted. Having grown up loving Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie, I'm not exactly a fanatic about stark realism -- but even I found this unthinkably unbelievable. A complete waste of time."
4,Very interesting!,"Started slow but got much better about 1/3 the way in. Basically, Tracy is the free-wheeling eccentric daughter of two famous actors who marries into a very uptight lawyer's family...a family that now has a missing daughter and unspecified scandal(s) in the past which may or may not relate to why their daughter is missing. Its quite a tangled web Tracy has to un-weave if she is to rescue her favorite in-law!"
1,Not worth it!,"This thing is basically useless. You can not access your nano menus, volume, etc. if you put it inside this sleeve. It is very poor quality and isn't worth $3, let a lone $30. I'm very disappointed."
2,Charging way too much for too little,"I purchased the red nano holder. It is basically a piece of leather with a strip of velcro sewn on. It does nothing to really protect the screen or the rest of the nano from scratches. It seems a little pricey at almost $30. It seems to be of good quality for what it is, though."
3,A bit over-long in parts,"This would have merited a higher rating if it wasn't for the middle third of the book. Once the setting moves to London the plot slows considerably and very little actually happens for 200 pages. The tedium of this section makes sticking with the story until the plot picks up again difficult. However I am glad I finished the book, as it did come to a satisfying (if predictably doomed and unhappy) ending.Jacob and Christopher's love is doomed not because they are gay men in Puritan England, but because Christopher is a romantic with a savior complex and Jacob is a violent schizophrenic. Although we are repeatedly told by Jacob of the punishments that they may face if they are found out - both Earthly: being hung or burned to death and spiritual: burning in Hell - they are generally treated kindly by the other characters who discover their relationship. They are ultimately victims of their own inner demons."
1,nothing happens,"This story starts out great, it places you in 17th century England during a civil war. There is a murder and the beginning of interesting character development. Once the main characters leave the battle field the story tumbles down a long boring hill. Hundreds of pages of getting up in the morning, eating meals and going to bed. I couldn't wait to rush through it to see if it would bring back the fire of the times. Where was the history and descriptions to place the reader in this period of time and place. I found this to be one of the most disappointing books I have ever read!"
1,a total waste of time!,"A total waste of timeIf you ask met his book was not only bad, but a total waste of time, unless the object was to describe a mad mans raving and the depths of depravity which one can sink to. I do not recommend it at all! The only thing one can say in its favour is that it is well written - by that I mean that though I did hate it, I still had to finish it ... all the while hoping for some great revelation, some explanation, some hint that would led me to understand ... but no such hint came!"
4,"Disturbing, intriguing read","This historically detailed account of English life in the 17th Century goes beyond ""fiction"" to tell a story of love, jealousy, betrayal, self-loathing and anger. As a narrator that is tragically flawed, Jacob Cullen begs forgiveness but can't seem to mend his ways. He seeks redemption, but his failure to achieve it ultimately weaves a disturbing tale that stays with the reader long after the book is done."
3,Very mixed feelings,"Rarely do I have such mixed feelings about a novel as I do about As Meat Loves Salt. On one hand, Ms. Mcann is a wonderful writer, the history is terrific and much of the relationship between Ferris and Jacob is believabe and romantic. Even the supporting characters are vividly drawn. On the other hand, Jacob is such a repellent character that he nearly ruins the book. I found his behavior to often be contrived, especially the voice in his head that occasionally pops up and left me confused as to whether the author wanted me to believe Jacob was mentally ill. Finally, I don't want to spend 500 plus pages with a protagonist who ultimately is a horrible person. If you don't mind that experience then this book is for you. Otherwise, think twice before reading."
1,Not for me,"I did not like this book at all. The main character is a murderous, unpleasant, untrustworthy man. He is that way in the beginning and that way at the end. There is nothing to like about him so I did not see why Ferris, his lover, chose him to come live with him and his aunt and help him with his colony. The colony was a disasterous idea from the start and I would think this would be easy to see to anyone that thought about it. This is an obvious first book, and I don't think I'll be buying any future ones."
3,Not sure if it should be a two or a three,I expected more from this book. I was a bit disappointed. That is not the truth. It was a very disappointing book. Jacob had chance after chance to grow beyond the person we original met at the beginning of the book. He was given a opportunity for self discovery and insights he had even repressed and yet NOTHING. I cant believe what a disappointing person I spent all this time exploring. I would like to believe that in his old age he reviewed his life and learn the lessons he failed so miseriably to get. I pray he became a man worthy of the tree that died for this book. But I am not sorry I read it. I would love to read it again and maybe make some of my own self discovery.
4,As meat meets man,"OK, so the professional critics seem to have focused on two things -- the authentic details of 17th-century life, and the irregular prose.I happen to have found the former a little too self-conscious (Pass the syllabub, please!), and the latter not much of a problem. It's a good read, and made all the more appealing by the fact that it tells the tale of a forbidden, but entirely believable love.I think the erotic passages are rather sexy, and I am only a little put off by the realization that amidst all the hot, salty activities described, there is very little bathing. There's period detail for you!"
2,As Meat Loves Salt,"I really did not enjoy this book and completed it because I was already half way through and felt I ought to. I am a historical fiction junkie so this lack of enjoyment is unusual for me. For me the story was slow and did not hold me enthralled. I was always looking for the next piece of the puzzle. Sometimes that piece was obvious and I just needed to arrive at it, and at other times it never really arrived at all but just...bumbled on. There were no big Ah-Ha's! for me. I judge a good book by whether I pass it on. This would be a 'no'."
5,"Henley - Like a Fine Wine - ""Better with Age""","As I expected, Don Henley never ceases to amaze me with his distinct voice and his cool, sophisticated stage presence. I saw this concert in Columbus, Ohio in 2000 and walked away one satisfied lady with Don's new songs and of course, ""End of the Innocence"" and ""Sunset Grill"". I have a surround sound stereo system and this DVD is usually my top request - listen to ""Everything is Different Now"" and ""My Thanksgiving"" - I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Don't expect a lot of onstage activity with this concert; grab your bottle of wine, kick back, and enjoy the show...it is quality musical entertainment from this outstanding artist."
5,Great concert !,"This is a must have DVD. Don Henley's concert it excellent, the musicians are 1st rate, and the DVD audio is great as well. As an earlier reviewer noted, the 5.1 mix added little to the rear channels, but this is a minor issue, this was definitely one of the best concert tours of 2000, and this DVD reflects this well. Personally, I think his latest CD is his finest solo effort to date, and one of the best CDs of the year."
5,henley at his best!,"Of course i also bought the eagles dvd, but this one is the more rock-side of henley.nice stage with a solid band (powerfull drums).all my favourite songs pass, such as new-york minute,boys of summer and some eagles tunes .don't like hotel california version (sorry don!).this is a top 10 music-dvd !!by the way:great sound!! (DTS)."
5,Awesome!!!!!!,I was a teen in the late 70's and an Eagles fan. I followed both Don Henley and Glenn Frye thru the 80's. When Hell Freezes Over came out on VHS I fell in love with it so it was no surprise that I bought the Inside Job CD as soon as it was released. When this DVD came out it was a must and did not disappoint!!!! I love it (except for the hair) and Don Henley is still rockin'!!! Talking To The Moon still makes me cry and My Thanksgiving has become my fav song...only wish that On My WEdding Day had been on here. And There Not Here....is kickin'. Inside Job is an absolute must for any music fan and this delivers all and more.....
4,Enjoyed the concert,"I like this DVD. It is a straight forward concert - no fluff between tracks - just live music. The songs are performed just like the originals and are excellent.I did find myself chuckling outloud during Hotel California but not because I didn't enjoy it. I chuckled because of the comments made by Mr. Narez in his review here on Amazon - I got a funny visual of what he must have gone through with his friends watching HC, especially when the trombone section played the blistering guitar solo of the original Eagles version. I missed the original HC, but enjoyed this version too.If you like Don's CD's, buy this."
3,Don Henley LIVE,"If you are looking for a concert full of spectacular effects, go and purchase ""Cher in concert"". Let's face it, Don Henley is not a stage show, but he is a fantastic songwriter. This concert filmed in 2000, displays some of his solo songs, and some songs from his contribution as a key member of the Eagles.I was looking very forward to watching this DVD. However, I was disappointed as the show lacked any spark, and his voice is not as good as it once was. In fact, he seemed to have trouble reaching the high notes on several occasions.This DVD comes with DTS, 5.1 surround sound and 2.0. Both DTS and 5.1 sound quite tinny and lack substantial bass. I recommend viewers selecting the 2.0 mix.DVD highlights include ""Taking You Home"" and ""Desperado"". As other reviewers have stated, his new version of ""Hotel California"" is dreadful. Skip that particular song."
3,"Can't Touch ""Hell Freezes Over""..","While just about ANY dts music DVD is worth a second look or listen, none has yet been made available to come within a mile of matching the spectacular audio/visual experience of the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"". This effort by Henley is worth adding to your collection, if for no other reason than the captivating new treatment of ""Hotel California"", but the background vocals and instrumental work on traditional Eagles songs falls far short of the magnificent talent displayed by the original personnel on ""Hell Freezes Over""."
3,3 Stars,"I bought the DVD becasue I like Henley's music and more importanly, because of the DTS format. The video was good but I was dissapointed in the Audio. Better than some but nowhere near the caliber of The Eagles/Hell Freezes Over (to which all others will be compared, imho)."
3,Henley Sucks,"I thought I have another gold to be added to my dvd concert collection unitl I heard Henley's solo version of HOTEL CALIFORNIA, it was a disaster in the highest intensity, I & my friends nearly died laughing and me , I was so embarrassed because before we played it I keep telling them that somebody wrote in the review that the HC version is worth the dvd (what a fool I was to believe that). How in the world could he allow himself in ruining the national anthem of many of the EAGELS believers!!!I condemn him for doing this!!! Fortunately for Henley he included the EAGLES' In The Long Run, this save his ass!!!....and compare the guitarists that Henley hired to join him here with EAGLES' Don Felder & Joe Walsh, they are 3000 miles away from Hell Freezes Over! Anyhow this is still a good dvd, good song choices and good audio on both DTS and DD, I could have rated it with 5 star but Henley's version of HC took away 2 stars! So come on Don redeem yourself!!!!"
3,"& then mr cooper said: ""if you think elephants are big, wait til you see my next movie...""","any fans of ""king kong"" (the real one, not the retreads) will be interested in this earlier merian c cooper movie, set in the jungles of then-siam, where a family learns to deal with the forces of nature, most notably an invading herd of elephants. short and involving, and fascinating as an early docudrama. also there is an interesting new musical score by thai musicians fongnam that id be tempted to buy on cd. still tho the main reason to see this is as a precursor to the skull island sequences of 5 years later."
3,Comprehensive Textbook of Geriatric Psychiatry,"I bought this book because I am doing a fellowship in geriatric psychiatry and was required to have it. I have to say: it is a very intense and thick book. It is NOT an easy read. I much rather read Principles and Practice of Geriatric Psychiatry by Agronin, which is reader friendly and informative. The faculty at my insitution agree with the above, but since this book is the one recommended by the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatry, this is the book we use."
5,just like I remember it,I used to buy this cologne when it was just California for Men from the Meijer stores here in Michigan back in the early 90s and missed it when they stopped carrying it. Was so glad to find it available still and still enjoy wearing it.
5,Making a difference,"As the interviewer and compiler of the text profiles in Reconstructing Aphrodite, I think often about the work I do and what kind of a difference it makes in the lives of others.Last night, I attended a spiritual healing ceremony for a friend who was just diagnosed with breast cancer. A small group of us recited and sang prayers for healing, held hands in a circle, and watched our stricken friend gather hope, strength, optimism and faith from our shared energy and love.The cancer is small, self contained and the prognosis for recovery good. But it's comforting to know that if my friend needs more inspiration and information, this book is available for her and the millions of other women who may need it in the future."
2,Disappointing,"This series took a turn for the worst with the 4th season. There was little actual character developoment, gratuitous violence and a plot that seemed very forced to be ""current"", i.e. Middle East conflicts, Afghan contract fighters being tortored. All of this takes the viewer very far away from the law firm dynamics that had seemed the backbone of the series."
2,Dissapointing,"I was so dissapointed with this season. I can't figure out why they had to sully up the season with so much filth, sex and bad language. I noticed it consistantly has a low rating so I can see that no one else liked it either. All the other seasons were so good and that tells me that people don't want all that filth. I hope they do better with the 5th season."
3,Not as good as previous seasons,"The first season was a great cliffhanger for the entire season, and the second and third followed suit. This one just wasn't quite as interesting.Still a good watch, though!"
5,kudos for season 4,"This season will not disappoint! If you enjoyed any or all of the prior seasons, or if you've not watched any, this season will stand alone as a complete story. There is no end to the drama and deceit! If you like that sort of thing, this is for you."
1,WHAT?,I started watching this with my paid in full prime membership and then - it turned into pay for each episode. WHAT!Kind of unfair practices don't you think.I am very disappointed with a company that I generally love. My low star rating is for AMAZON right now.
1,Sad that it was removed from Prime,"Got half way through the season, which was really good, and then it was removed from Prime. Very bad form on Amazon's part."
1,Damages 4,"One star for Amazon not for Damages. Amazon, what are you playing at? Bait and switch!Damages season 4 was one of the few things I want to watch on your prime instant videos. I'm not prepared to pay more money to watch this or any show."
2,Have to pay for the last 2 episodes?? Seriously??,"The series is just OK this season. Amazon MAJOR fail for making people pay for last few episodes after it was free for prime membership. I'm on the free premium trial (comparing it to Hulu+ and Netflix,) and I'm not continuing it going forward because of this action. Super shifty. Not enough good programs available for the yearly membership IMO."
3,Amazon Prime's Underhanded Move,"I am so upset with Amazon Prime at this moment. I was on a Damages marathon for a couple weeks, starting with the first season. When I finally started watching free episodes of season 4, in preparation for the new season of Damages, Amazon moved it from FREE to PAY. I almost cancelled my Prime membership because of this crap. I am so surprised at Amazon Prime because I have been a staunch advocate for Amazon Prime, getting my fellow students to sign up. This sucks!"
3,It's like heroin,I too am a bit disturbed that this went from free for prime members to being a pay for streaming product.I only got about 4 episodes into it.When drug dealers sell heroin the first hit is usually free and then you have to pay after that.I can only assume that since the new season started there must have been increased demand for the last season so the decision was made to move it to a pay per view model. I can understand the motive but I still feel a bit slighted.
1,Watching on Prime halted. What gives?,I am just repeating what others are saying... I also was watching the show streaming on Prime then in the middle of the second episode it studdered then stopped. Now they are charging 2 or 3 dollars depending on the HD or standard. Ugh!
3,Huh? What Happened?!?,"My wife and I viewed the first two episodes Monday evening. Tuesday evening, we found out we had to pay if we wished to view more. What happened? Having to navigate the disorganized morass of Amazon's streaming menus is bad enough, but this too?! Three stars for what scraps of the show were left for us, one for Amazon's rug yanking treachery!"
3,Prime blasted as well,"Wow it's amazing how many of us were in the middle of season 4 when they did this.I had just discovered Damages finally the week they decided to make the change.I was all the way through episode 8 of season 4 when I went to bed, next day I get up, go to work, and come home to finish up and bam no more Prime watching of Season 4.I was really surprised.I have been a Prime member for right around 3 years now, way before the Prime videos, and I push it a lot to a lot of people I work with because there are some advantages if you use them.But WOW, Prime came back to bite me on this one, as lame as it sounds this is my biggest let down with Prime, mainly because I have had such good luck with them the past 3 years.As someone who purchases no less than 30-40 PAGES of orders each year that's not too bad.But they should have given us warning, something."
1,Very dissapointing,"My wife and I loved this show until we got to the fourth season. Now it's just F word after F word and pointless nude scenes. I really don't know what they were thinking when they brought all of this filth into the show. I don't think we are going to bother watching the rest of the season, it's just a waste of time now."
4,Damages IV,"Pros: Great casting and acting brings this fictional story to life. Glen Close is in her element here. I also have gained a good deal of respect for Ted Danson, Lilly Tomlin, and John Goodman for their acting abilities that I think is due in part to the directing. It is nice to see where the direction goes to several different individuals- rarely the same director for any two back-to-back episodes, and this helps keep the show fresh.Cons: Only 10 episodes for season 4- the first 3 seasons had 14, so this was disappointing."
2,Huge Step Down,"With the shift to FX this season was a major step down from the previous few. While the characters were the same the writing and plot lines were wooden and predictable. Overall, unless you're set on seeing the entire series this isn't worth 10 hours of your time."
3,OK. Patty Hewes turned kinda lame,"Can tell the movie went down hill. Lost its luster and the dynamic, dysfunctional relationship of patty and ellen. Patty turns kinda lame and just not her cut throat self, which was the foundation of the show and key in keeping our interest."
2,Where's season 4 ep 5 for PRIME?,Been watching Damages in Prime all day now when I get to episode 5 I have to pay? I'm very disappointed. I can't even view it on Direct TV because it skips from episode 4 to episode 9.....WTH happened?
3,Pay for Damages?,I am with you Snell. We were also starting to watch Damages on Prime and yesterday we noticed it was taken off Prime and now Amazon is charging for it. I am reluctant to start watching West Wing cause I am afraid they will do the same thing with this series. Talk about bait and switch....
2,Damaged Damages,"After reading about all of your troubles with Amazon Prime (I was thinking about joining), I rented Damages-Season 4 from Blockbuster.com!I've only watched the First CD so far. I'd like to know what happens next, but don't exactly feel the need to rush. Fact is... something is missing in this season. Is it the acting? Editing? Writing? I'm not sure. Perhaps it's ""All of the Above""! Things just don't seem to ""click"" as well as in the past.This is a review based on what I've seen so far; It's NOT for any Amazon service."
3,May Never Know How it Ends,"Longtime Amazon customer and Prime member. Like others, we were able to watch approximately half of season 4 before it was suddenly pulled from Prime. Refuse to pay per episode to finish watching the rest of the season. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Dick Turpin & Black Bess,"At least Dick Turpin wore a mask. First time using my Prime account to watch a show for free, and of course will be my last with Amazon...waiting for Netflix now."
2,Falls flat in Season 4,"Seasons 1-3 were pretty darn tight. But this season (the first since leaving FX) is WAY off. Awesome actors, but a completely ludicrous plot and horrible production values. Ill check out season 5... im hoping they fot better writers/bigger budget. Lower your expectations for this one."
3,No longer free with Prime,"I started watching Damages season 4, and was pleased it was included in Prime membership. Today the series has to be purchased to view. Why would Amazon release something, include it under prime, and then pull it back? Not happy with Amazon here. The TV series is great, but not worth paying extra for."
2,Free with prime then it's not?!,Boy if this is not an example of bait and switch I don't know what is. I started watching Season 4 as it was free with my Prime membership only to find out that it is now no longer free. Not happy.
1,scammed by Amazon!,"I was SHOCKED to suddenly see I was to be charged to watch season 4 of Damages after streaming multiple episodes for free as a Prime member - what a scam - it's a great series, which I'd give 5 stars, but I'm so turned off to Amazon."
3,Poor Quality,"Several times while watching this episode, the show would ""freeze"" sometimes for 10 minutes at a time. At one point it just froze and never started back up. We ended up stopping it and tried to watch the rest of it the next night. Very disappointed."
4,Pretty Decent,"If you have young kids or grandkids, and they like to dance, they'll like this basic video."
4,So Many Fun Things To LEARN About....,"This book is packed with fun things to teach your child... from holidays and what the month of December is all about to types of Birds, to numbers, to letters, to types of jobs such as farmers and doctors. The illustrations are adorable and so innocent. Some pages are filled with colorful illustrations while others are filled with tiny illustrated things to learn. You and your child will have many long hours to spend looking at the pictures, reading, teaching him/ her to read it, and just learning and talking about all the things the pages in this lovely book have to offer. Great opportunities for one-on-one time with your child."
5,penny,This movie is spell-bounding! It takes me back to abadania each time i watch it. It gives so much hope and faith in God in restoring our health. I had tears stream down my face and felt healing energy from the good entities at Casa. The Movie also gives us a reality check about working on ourselves to go within to become a better human being. It is movie that people must watch before going down to CASA. A fabulous movie!
2,Great collection of songs...but poor sound,I have most of Duane Eddy's CDs and have listened to his music consistently since the '50s. This double album CD could have been a great addition to his library except the sound is AWFUL. It sounds like the audio guys at Colpix added echo on top of echo when this CD was mastered. I've only listened to the CD a couple times and want to cry because of the terrible sound.
4,Duane does the hits his way.,"This is an very good album.I got the original cd from 1991 released on EMI records.This got super sound.This release got poorer sound,can not give more than 4 stars because of the soundquality.Go hunting for the release from 1991 on EMIrecords,happy hunting."
3,"Good material, but stripped down re-release","This documentary is a budget re-release of the 2000 DVD of the same name. It has the same documentary material, but the 30-minute bonus music track has been stripped out. Oddly--or misleadingly--the songs are still listed on the back of the keep case."
2,Major mistake,"Marianne was not married to Nicholas Dunbar...she was married to John Dunbar. Nicholas is their son. And lucky to have been born before the Uber-Narcissist Marianne went into drug neverland.I presume Marianne has disclosed in this video, as she did in her autobio, that she lost another child (a girl, Mick Jagger's child) due to anemia obviously caused by drugs. Her name would have been Corinna, it's said.I have not seen this DVD so can't judge it, but just wanted to clarify the family names. It would probably bug even Marianne to see that her ex-husband was mistaken for her son."
2,"Very bad RF interference, but excellent otherwise","Excellent price, excellent color and seems to be built good.HOWEVER, IT YOU NEED A TRANSMITTER TO RUIN THE RECEPTION ON LOTS OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES, THIS IS THE RIGHT PRODUCT.I have an outdoor TV antenna and after 1 second of plugging this product in, I lost reception on many channels.This camera will get your neighbors mad at you as the RF output interference it causes is really bad. The FCC obvious never approved this product!"
2,Missing Mounting Bracket/Hardware,For the vast majority of my purchases from Amazon they have been nothing short of sterling . . . .this purchase unfortunately was the exception - purchased this along with 6 other CCD security cameras along with two DVR . . . . . did not open this box until almost three weeks later as I was installing cameras one at a time . . . . guess what ?? No bracket or hardware !!! and the box was sealed . . . . . I know Q-see makes a good product . . . but quality control on ensuring what they state us in the box . . . is ACTUALLY in the box . . . . . contacted Amazon . . . . . more to follow . . . .as I see how Amazon handles the missing parts !!
5,Quality - Good picture.,"I have this camera for allmost 2 weeks hookup and it is working fine.The night shot is one of the best I ever saw, (up to 15 meters). The downpoint isI needed to buy a extension cord for the power, but for the rest is a greate productfor the price, I will buy 2 more."
1,Q-See Model # QS2350,"The first camera ran about 3 minutes and quit.After four weeks finally recieved the warranty replacement camera.The warranty replacement camera worked for six days and then failed. We have sent it also for repair or exchange, but have not recieved the replacement yet."
3,Works some of the time,I bought this camera more as a highly visible camera for security purposes. Worked inside but when it was installed outside it quit working. I also purchased the smaller Qsee night vision camera's and they work awesome. Looks like daylight outside all night long!!
2,Please save your money!,"I bought this game because the price tempted me. Please don't make my mistake! EA Sports is the best sports games company there is, but this pack is a waste. The only game in there that is very good is NHL 99, which I love, but the other three are a total bust. Triple Play 2000 is boring and dull, and Tiger Woods 99 is confusing to understand and difficult to play. I don't know if this is very common, but the NBA Live is full of technical problems, and crashes often. A much better alternative would be to buy NHL 2001, FIFA 2001 or a Madden game."
4,Review,I like that it holds enough peppercorns so that I don't have to refill as often as I did with my other peppermill. I like that the screw knob is large enough for my arthritic fingers to grasp easily. I think it's overpriced considering the materials it's made of and the simple mechanism. I hope that the price is an indicater of its durability. I can't comment on that aspect of the peppermill because Amazon will keep bugging me to write a review if I wait to write a proper review.
1,Do not buy this!,"The first time this product arrived it was broken due to poor packaging.After a month I got a new one. This time it was not broken but the wrong color. Which really doesn't matter, but this accordion is of really poor quality for what you are paying. Bubbles in the ""wood"", buttons stick, bellows aren't of very good quality. Do not buy this. Go to Kijiji or something so you can see the accordion."
4,Pre Emptive review?...,"I fully agree with Vito's comments.This was one of those diamonds in the rough... forgotten (actually, ignored in it's time) gem that so stands out in it's dark way. Obviously of extremely low budget, it's brilliant director makes that fact almost irrelevant as he crafts an off-kilter, noirish sci fi thriller that, while typical of many 50's genre movies, stands apart in so many ways. The titled robot is a way cool, original design. Think Gort as costumed by ""Things to Come"".I have this on VHS. So hoping the DVD release does it justice. Which is why I am reserving a star until then. I WILL be checking this out!"
3,Colossal Boredom,"I'm gonna keep this review extremely short and simply say that if you're familiar the original Outer Limits series then you'll understand when I say that The Colossus of New York is like an episode of that, except running at a little over an hour...a very long hour. Yes, it has great FX as far as the costume, the story itself is pretty clever and the musical score makes for an eerie atmosphere and so this is absolutely not cheesy B-grade sci-fi. But lots of really dry acting coupled with tons of scientific sounding nonsense all mixed with Ross Martin at his melodramatic worst (fans of Wild Wild West know what I'm talking about) and not to mention an utterly lame ending all work together to make this film a real drag.If only the movie was as cool as the cover... my advice is rent before buying! :o)"
4,COLOSSUL CLASSIC,"THE COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK COMBINES SCI~FI WITH GOTHIC FRANKENSTEIN-THEMED HORROR. ROSS MARTIN (WHO PLAYED ARTEMUS GORDON IN THE 60'S WILD,WILD WEST)GIVES A CREDIBLE AND SYMPATHETIC PERFORMANCE AS THE TORMENTED AND HUNTED COLOSSUS. AND THE SCENES WITH HIS LITTLE SON ARE MOVING. YOUR DAD IS DEAD...BUT WAIT-HE'S NOW A PATHETIC ROBOTIC BEING WITH ONLY TRACES OF WHAT ONCE WAS YOUR FATHER. POWERFUL THEME INDEED. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE SEEN. IT STANDS OUT AMONG THE MANY OTHER FILMS OF THE TIME."
1,Potential without Performance,"I had high hopes for this movie, but was disappointed. The Colossus isn't, and when the description talks about the Colossus destroying New York, he doesn't. Ross Martin is always fun to watch, but it's only his voice after maybe twenty minutes. Plus the movie spends too much time dealing with angst. Very little development of anything but maybe the old film used to make this stinker."
3,Major Let Down,"Based on the reviews that I read here, I was extremely eager to view this film. So, I bit the bullet and ordered the disc.Clocking it at only 70 minutes, the film actually felt too long and ultimately bored the hell out of me. I viewed it twice just to make sure I wasn't missing something - I wasn't. It's just a slow, boring film.Technically, the picture looks surprisingly good with solid blacks, good contrast and very little artifacts. I very solid visual presentation indeed. Sonically, the sound was uneven and unnatural and I found myself having to raise/lower the volume often. With regards to extras - there are none - not even a single trailer, which begs the question why in the hell is this film priced at 19 dollars??? Honestly, it shouldn't cost more than 5 bucks.The only thing making me give this film 3 stars instead 2 is because of occasionally interesting camera work and a few legitimately creepy parts."
4,"rare creepy 50""s robot film","very unusual 50""s sci fi starring an early ross martin that somehow became a lost film for who knows why, for years no one could get a quality print, now at last a beautiful print in anamorphic { fills the whole rectangular screen in proper ratio, no distortion,} one of the most creepy sci fi robots ever created in my humble opinion,interesting story that goes beyond many ""b"" drive-in movies of its period,primative but dramatic special effects might even be interesting to a young student of sci fi film, an absolute pristine high quality print from ""olive films""thank you olive films, what a pleasure to watch."
4,Betty Davis Eyes,I first saw this movie back in 1959 (age 8) and I found it so incredibly creepy in that it wasthe epitome of malevolent sci-fi behavior (Gort). I was awestruck at his incorrigible mind setand was freaked out when he fried everybody at the United Nations forum. The scene where he walksacross the floor of the East River was over the top. This film is a masterpiece much in thesame vein as the 'Quatermass' films.Keith Owen
3,Captain Bob in uncertain seas,"The illustration style is great complements the text well. The one thing bothers me is the boy in the story appears older than he should be. But if you get by that, it is a fun book after your child's bath time."
4,Captain Bob Sets Sail,The lovely story Captain Bob Sets Sail is a adventure book. It tells you how one little boy who calls him self Captain Bob Makes up this wild story about taking a bath. It it likely your children will have a better imagination and maybe even like taking a bath. He explains how the faucet in the tub is a waterfall and how he saves the day by turning it off. This charming story also has lots of discriptive words and givel large visual pictures of what he says if happening. Its a great book to read to yru children before or during there bath. It wil make bathing more fun.
5,Hitchcock Rules!,"Universal has dealt with the issues and the early reviews are great. Don't let the nay-sayers dampen your enthusiasm. They'll never look like a newer film and this is likely as good as they'll ever look. Big improvement in picture quality from the DVD set. Hopefully the price will come down from $225. These are some of the best classic films ever made by my favorite director. Day one purchase!UPDATE: Well, for the most part this set impresses with the uptick in picture quality. The price is still out of line, though. The titles that don't look all that great are TMWKTM, Marnie and Family Plot. The others are great to very good IMO."
1,American viewers paying $ 70 dollars more.,"Thanks to a previous review, I did checkout The Hitchcock collection on the amazon.com.uk website. It was one hundred pounds, which translates to about seventy dollars less than the American version. The box that it comes in is way cooler than the psychedelic cover of the American version. It may come out a week later than the American version and take a week longer to get here, but the additional cash will help pay for the Bond collection."
2,Product may be recalled,"Potential buyers should know that this product may be recalled because of typographical errors in newly-replaced credits on FRENZY. Early analysis of the discs points up problematic transfers for MARNIE, TORN CURTAIN, FAMILY PLOT and FRENZY. In at least MARNIE's case it appears these are not just poor transfers but actual errors in the authoring. Rumours have already spread that the set may be delayed. Even if it is not, it's quite likely that a mail-in replacement programme wll be initiated, so buyer beware."
2,No Audio during the last 15 minutes,"Was so excited to get the collection as a gift. Watched Rear Window, one of my favorites. Got to the last 20 minutes and the audio started to fragment. Eventually there was no audio for the remainder of the movie. Really, the best part, the highlights of the movie with no sound! For the price of this collection, there are no excuses as this appears to be a consistent issue. Returning for a full refund. Very Disappointed."
5,Wonderful Collection,"This is a great collection many of Hitchcock's best movies. His later movies (those after Marnie) are somewhat painful to watch, but it was wonderful to discover gems like ""The Trouble with Harry."" I wish they would have re-restored ""Rear Window."" The Blu-ray transfers are nothing short of spectacular. They also FINALLY cleaned up the opening Saul Bass credits to ""Psycho."" I'm bummed that I had already purchased ""Psycho"" and ""North-by-Northwest."" This collection is fantastic. The upgrades from DVD are stunning."
5,Hitchcock review,Because he's the master of suspense. And it came on time. And was the correct order this time. And it arrived on time
3,Beware: Mastering issues and overuse of DNR,"Reviewer Nick Wrigley has pre-release review copies and has posted of several mastering errors and other problems.Notably:* For Frenzy:""A completely re-rendered opening credit sequence for this new HD master introduces typographical inconsistencies, wrong fonts, typos, and multiple errors in crew members' names. Parts of the film are slathered in noticeable DVNR which causes undesirable effects. I can't recommend this disc. Dear Universal, when the credits get fixed (which hopefully involves simply putting the original credits back, regardless of softness or damage), please dial back the DVNR across the whole film too.""* DVNR issues on ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (Yes, Universal strikes again)* Bad ""non-film like"" encoding on ""Marnie"" and ""Torn Curtain""* Color shifts during the titles of ""Vertigo"" and the English audio is reprocessed 5.1 ONLY - no original mono or stereo mix, just faux surround.Read the reviews yourself at [...]"
4,"Great set. But Universal should recall ""Family Plot""","As most of have already commented, this is a stellar set with mostly excellent transfers of classic films. I'll echo the comment that the ""Family Plot"" transfer is a disaster. While not Hitchcock's greatest film, this is a sparkling comedy thriller that deserves a better fate. I was looking forward to it for personal reasons, having attended the premiere of this film as a kid at the LA Filmex event and a dinner honoring Hitchcock afterwards at the Century Plaza Hotel. Aside from the poor ""Marnie"" transfer, which some reviewers commented may be due to source materials, the rest of the set is amazing and well worth the money. Some of the transfers are so good (""Topaz"" for example) it's almost like seeing these films for the first time."
4,Mostly very good with a couple of missteps,"Overall I'm very happy with this set, especially for the $120 Amazon special I bought it on. Most every movie looks beautiful. Other reviewers have mentioned ""Family Plot"" and ""Marnie"" as flawed and this is true, but not for the full duration. Oddly, both of these films have some shots that have a low-res pixilated quality to them. But other major segments are beautiful high-def images. Why the inconsistency? I can say that they have ""Frenzy"" corrected with the original titles and it looks terrific. ""Vertigo"" also looks beautiful to me, but there is the one shot at the end in the bell tower that is out of focus. Was it photographed that way in the original? How does a high-def transfer render one shot out of focus? Anyway, with all these items considered, the bulk of the package is great and is probably the best renditions of these films we'll ever get."
4,"Movies are great, image quality is variable.","Most of the 15 films in the package have been lovingly restored and look great in Blu-Ray. The exceptions are ""Marnie"" and ""Family Plot"" -- those two are very grainy. It's not that you'd see it only if you were looking for it; you can't help but notice it. Universal could (should) have done a better job on those two. Otherwise, it's a great collection, including all of what I consider to be the really essential Hitchcock films, ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Rear Window"", ""Psycho"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and ""The Birds""."
5,ALFRED HITCHCOCK: THE MASTERPIECE COLLECTION,THIS COLLECTION HAS SOME GREAT MOVIES IN IT BUT THERE ARE MISSING SOME GREAT MOVIES ALSO FROM THE MASTER SO ENJOY BUT YOU WONT BE COMPLETELY SATISFIED.
3,very disappointing,"If you really must have this set, make sure to buy it from a retailer that has a good return policy. If you purchase it from Amazon or a mail order vendor, make sure you have it shipped by air or Priority mail. Finding a better online price that has low or free ground shipping may be a mistake. The packaging is so poor, your disks may arrive damaged. A number of my disks have small scratches and I believe one has a sticky substance (glue?) from the sleeves the disks go into. It remains to be seen whether the disks with scratches will play properly or not. Universal took alot of flak for on of their defective Alfred Hitchcock Presents sets a while back. You'd think they'd get it right by now."
1,This Blu-ray Collection is far cheaper in Australia:,"Don't bother with this U.S. release. It's far too expensive! The Australian release of 14 films (missing 'North By Northwest'), sells on Blu-ray for $79.20 (JB HiFi). Even the Blu-ray version of 'North By Northwest' is only another $11.98. All 14 films have their related extras."
5,What a cool looking set,This is one good looking set to see a video review of of it copy and paste this Alfred Hitchcock The Masterpiece Collection (Limited Edition) Blu Ray review to youtube see the unboxing and review of this set
3,"Some of the ""Masterpieces"" are missing","Two things that need to be made clear.First, the U.K. version is much cheaper and Region Free and when buying from Amazon, the shipping from the U.K. is about $5.00.Second, as the title of this review implies, not all of the films are here. There are notable ""masterpieces"" missing. Some of them are:39 StepsThe Lady VanishesRebeccaSuspicionSpellboundNotoriousThe Paradine CaseRopeStage FrightStrangers on a TrainDial M for MurderTo Catch a ThiefThat is 12 masterpieces that are missing. So, buyer beware."
2,Make it a 20 film set next time,"If Universal is going to go all out and put together a Hitchcock compilation that includes hits like Vertigo, Birds, Pyscho, Rear Window, and North by Northwest, they shouldn't leave out other key films held in high regards.Where is Rebecca, Lifeboat, Spellbound, Strangers On A Train, and Dial M For Murder? Three of those films were Best Director nominees for goodness' sake."
3,Disappointing Collection,"This collection is somewhat disappointing. Already owning North by Northwest and Psycho on Blu-Ray made me wonder if this Collection was worth buying and selling the two duplicates. I'm passing on this Collection and will buy the ones I want separately. The reason for my downgrade of this Collection is the inclusion of the two lesser films, Frenzy and Family Plot. Strangers on a Train, Spellbound, Notorious, Suspicion, Lifeboat, The 39 Steps, etc. These are great Hitchcock films and to exclude them is ridiculous."
1,terrible timing,"why wasn't this offered months ago I already own 3 of the movies listed in this box set Psycho, North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train. I pre ordered The Birds almost a year ago and still have not received it but now it seems the only way to get it is through this box set, just doesn't make sense to buy a whole new box set for one movie, someone botched this one."
2,What IS on those 15 disks,funny how nothing is mentioned in this article! No index of what the 15 films are... Oh well. You can buy all 15 on eBay a LOT CHEEPER Than the 225$ ho ho ho!!!
5,Finally see the films in beautiful HD!,"A great box set with all the Hitchcock classics (except perhaps ""Dial M for Murder"" and ""To Catch a Thief"" which are available on Blu-ray separately). In my opinion, the addition of ""North By Northwest"" is huge and worth the difference that some are complaining about.I have not watched all the films, but I popped in ""The Birds"" and the image looks amazing in full 1080. Some of the new bonus features are 1080, the rest are in 480 from older box sets, but they still look fine."
4,Essential Hitchcock on Blu-ray with some Caveats,"Length:: 10:00 MinsThe most anticipated Blu-ray release of the year shipped a few weeks ago--Universal's Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection. I've gone through the individual titles to give an extensive review. Some of the films--REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, SHADOW OF A DOUBT--look absolutely amazing. While others, like MARNIE, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and FAMILY PLOT, are in need of whole new transfers. This review is in full 1080p on YouTube.Steven DeRosa, author ""Writing with Hitchcock"""
2,Too little too late,"This recording was clearly done to capture the great Joan Sutherland before she had to stop. I wish they had done it a few years earlier -- La Stupenda is not in good voice here. Also, the video is grainy and dark, the staging clunky, the other singers not outstanding, and the sound quality not very good. I cannot recommend it. To hear Sutherland in her prime, get one of the older CDs and forego the visuals. If you need a beautiful video, get the recent Netrebko release. No one will ever do Lucia as stunningly as Sutherland did, but this is not the recording to show that."
3,SUTHERLAND IN THE LATE AUTUMN,"The performance is adequate. Sutherland's performance is quite amazing when considered that she was sixty years old in 1986. Unfortunately, she sounds every day of it. She can still encompass the notes (though there are some downward transpositions in the Mad Scene) but her sound by this time had become faded, with ""gray"" patches all over the range. Her 1982 Met Lucia, also on videotape, is somewhat brighter vocally. Still, even that one is a far cry from the Sutherland voice in its glorioius prime. I would probably give this one a pass, get one of Sutherland's audio recordings (either of the London recordings), and get a DVD Lucia with a younger-sounding soprano."
1,Unbelievable,"I cannot believe how bad this performance is. I remember putting it in my player with a smile on my face in anticipation...and 20 minutes later I was tearing my hair out in bodily pain and slapping myself in disbelief. If you love lucia like I do, you will be scarred forever after listening to how badly it was butchered by sutherland and co. Please save your money. I don't think sutherland is the best lucia, but she's infinitely, infinitely better than this elsewhere."
3,Mozart Violin Sonatas,"I don't like throwing cold water on all of the previous reviews that this set of CDs has received, but I was dissapointed. The cause of this is that the piano dominates the violin, in many instances the violin is almost inaudible due to the loudness of the piano, especially when the piano is playing on the left side of middle C."
4,Good stuff,"I'm just a classical music neophyte so I can't speak to how this compares to other musicians renditions of Mozart's Violin Sonatas, but I liked this very much."
5,Good Pruduct,"First,I'm an average person with very little knowledge but I ordered this item followed the instructions and now back on line...Easy to install and connect. Cox Communications also provided great and helpful support to activate unit...Thanks to All..."
2,Told By Apartment Complex That It Doesn't Work on Their Syst,Apartment complex has it's own cable system. I purchased this product but before I opened it I checked with the complex and was told that the last 4 Toshiba modems they tried to hook up didn't work. They said the Motorola or Linksys modems worked fine. They talked with the Toshiba tech support but still couldn't get it going for some reason. So just a word of warning to check with your cable supplier before making a decision on the modem.
1,Flakey,Had it for 2 years or so. Now it only goes for a day or so and freezes. I have to disconnect the power and reconnect every day. Very annoying. Tech support NON-EXISTENT.
2,Fair modem,"I purchased this product in 2003 at our local Costco Store. At about the five year mark of ownership, the modem needed occasional reboots, due to dropping from the internet. I recently had to replace it with a Linksys modem, due to more consistent drop off's (like weekly, instead of every few months as prior). The installation is somewhat of a pain, having to use an CD install.I also have noticed over the time of ownership, that this modem is always very warm to the touch."
5,Rock solid after 3 1/2 years,"I bought this modem in April 2003, and in over 3 1/2 years its performance is rock solid. A speed test this week showed I was receiving near the theoretical max for my service level from my provider, so speed has not and continues not to be a problem. In those many years, I don't think I've reset the device more than once a year at most.I recently advised a friend to pick one of these up as he is having daily problems with is provider's supplied modem. Unfortunately, it looks like it may not be available anymore through resellers like Amazon. Too bad.In short, it is hard to find a high-tech product that works perfectly without any effort on your part, but count this modem among that group of devices. If you find one of these, buy it."
1,Router died after 3 years,This router no longer functioned after 3 years. For the last 2 years it required reseting every month or so while also producing a high-pitched sound. This past week it would drop the internet signal after high bandwidth uploads or downloads and I was reseting frequently per day. This morning it officially died and would not register a cable signal.I'm going to buy a Motorola Surfbound Cable Modem and hope it serves me better.
5,Excellent cable modem at a bargain price.,"Recently I decided to switch from a dial-up internet service provider with a 56K modem to cable internet service with the a cable modem. The cable modem service has several advantages: (1) I don't have to dial a number to access it; it's on all the time, (2) It's MUCH faster than a 56K modem, and (3) using my computer via a cable modem doesn't tie up my telephone line. My cable company specifically recommended that I buy a Toshiba cable modem so I bought the new Toshiba Pcx2200. So far it has performed flawlessly and I am thoroughly satisfied with it. It seems to be quite versatile: it works with both PCs and Macs (I use a Mac) and is compatible with both ethernet and USB interfaces. The low price was a pleasant surprise -- many other cable modems that were not specifically recommended by my cable company were more expensive. I've had a long histrory of satisfaction with Toshiba products and highly recommend this one."
2,Go with a Motorola Surfboard,I bought this product to try and save a little money but found that it was a wash. I first bought one on craigslist and it didn't work. Then I though that maybe someone sold me a bad modem and bought one on Amazon. I work but was too much of a hard time to get it to work. I found that my carrier didn't recognize the modem and had to call and sit on the phone while they configure it for their network. After getting knocked of tones of times I gave up and bought the surfboardGO WITH THE SURF. AND SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND TROUBLE.
2,Worked great for a year...and then Kaput,"No problems, fast and cheap until exactly 1 year. Then slowly kept dropping more and more until it never could establish the connection. Not a great choice."
3,"Good for the $$, but incomplete","What! No ""Red Skies"" or ""Stand Or Fall"". Sorry, but those two videos were on heavy rotation in the early 80's on MTV and therefore very necessary to a ""proper"" Fixx DVD collection. The other videos in this collection were also very popular on MTV.Video & Audio quality are very good on this DVD.Since AMAZON does not provide a video list for this DVD, I'll provide one:-One Thing Leads To Another-Secret Separation-Saved By Zero-The Sign Of Fire-Are We Ourselves"
4,Missing Two Favorites,"I didn't figure the two first videos would be on it when I looked at it the first time in 2004. Need a complete video collection. I do like the videos on the disc, but needed the first two of their videos. You would think by now they would of had one out. Chas"
4,My scalp and hair have no residue...what a joy.,"I have a problem with psoriasis and no shampoo nor prescrption seemed to give me relief. A friend reccommended this product and gave me a sample. I felt that it removed a lot of residue and left my hair and scalp cleansed. I like the freshness that my scalp feels. It has helped albeit a bit drying, I use it with another product and am having positive results.Thank you for a good productM Wilcox"
4,A Noble Defeat,"This is perhaps one of the most interesting of the voluminous pantheon of memoirs published in the aftermath of World War II. Raeder was already an old man when WWII started, and a series of strategic and tactical mistakes made by both he and Hitler rendered even the most lethal Kreigsmarine units useless.I like the ""inside story"" Adm. Raeder provides -- the petty jealousies of the German military leadership, the personal rivalry with Hermann Goering over the fate of naval aviation.Perhaps the weakest element of this book is Raeder's biases and constant reassertion of his own honorable status. Still, that seems to be the only thing that drags this otherwise revealing work down. A must read for naval, especially battleship, enthusiasts."
5,Alternative Medicine review,"It is rare to read a book on Alternative Medicine, which is not openly biased toward one opinion or another; but Alternative Medicine-The Christian Handbook is different. The book clearly outlines the evidenced-based criteria used for the evaluation of each therapy, and simply seeks to inform the reader. It does this in an understandable, readable format. I was especially impressed with the breadth of the therapies covered. As an Osteopathic Physician, I was particularly interested in the book's discussion of manipulative therapies and was very satisfied with the content and quality of the comments. I highly recommend the book to patients and physicians, who wish to learn more about this dynamic area of medicine."
4,Safe and Sound Information About Herbs,"With a very even hand, these authors have created an easy to read, well-organized reference book. Supplements and herbs are recommended or not recommended based on scientific evidence.The herbs are organized alphabetically. Each succinct discussion is divided into sections such as: what it is, claims, study findings, cautions, recommendations, dosage, treatment categories and further reading. These categories make it easy to get to the information you want quickly. If you are really in a hurry, there is a list of symptoms and diseases in the back with corresponding therapies rated by effectiveness.If you are looking at herbal remedies for the first time, this book will get you off to a SAFE start."
2,Misleading book,In some areas of this book there is misinformation on some of the types of alternative therapies. This book is very slanted against any kind of alternative therapy. By the standards raised in this book even modern medicine is against the Bible.
5,Practical and Biblically based resource...,"Could you use a practical resource that gives alternative medicinal practices an honest and unbiased review--then you should read ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. If you are looking for a resource enhanced with Biblically based counsel concerning alternative approaches to medicine, then look no further, you will absolutely love this book. You do not have to have a Doctor's degree to understand this material. It is written in easy-to-understand language the average lay-person will appreciate. I highly recommend this medical reference manual."
5,A Must For Docs and Patients,"This concise, well-researched and evidence-based review of alternative therapies is a must for physicians and patients trying to make sense of all the information out there. And how wonderful to have a handbook on this delicate subject that is written from a biblical perspective! It is easy to read, and perfect for use as a quick reference in a busy medical practice and also at home."
3,The Patron Saint of Unmarried Women - Karl Ackerman,"This book, in my opinion, is probably best described as a ""pot-boiler"". It's very readable but there's not a lot in it. A lot of it seems to be male fantasy and Jack often gets boorish and tiring. The lengthy descriptions of male bonding through basketball got a bit hokey for me."
2,Not Much Substance,"This book is a light read, humorous, but irritating. I hated how she kept referring to ""Julia Childs"" -- it's Julia CHILD, no S. And by the way, Julia Child never had any children, so why are you referring to her in terms of being some sort of perfect mother? I would say take a pass on this book. There's not much substance here. If you must, borrow it from the library."
4,Granddaughter loves monkeys,Ordered this for my granddaughter because she loves monkeys. Looked just like the picture and was well made. She loves it!
3,WWII Homecoming,"While waiting for her husband to return from the war after too long apart, Agatha Troy accepts a commission to paint the eccentric actor Sir Henry Ancred at his family home Ancreton.While the book has many strong points, the plot becomes exceedingly muddled at the end, and I'm not sure that Troy by herself is strong enough to carry a mystery novel on her own as a central character. Even though Alleyn appears near the end, he's not involved for long enough to provide his typical witty effect.On the other hand, the characters here are among her most vivid-- including ringworm-ridden Panty and the smarmy Cedric. For stronger Marsh I'd recommend Artists in Crime, Death and the Dancing Footman, or Died in the Wool."
1,"Worthless, pointless, every copy should be destroyed","Okay, the story is about dancers and a manager who survives a plane crash and make it onto ""Spider Island."" Instead of seeing them being chased by spiders, one bites the manager and he turns into a half-spider, half-man. I don't care if the special effects in a 60s flick is bad, but the horrible acting and the stupidness of this movie is enough to make you cringe. You don't see the fake looking spiders or the manager wearing his fake werewolf mask for a long time. Most of the time you see the dancers talking in what sounds like the same voice. At one point, you see a fight between two of the dancers that lasts for twenty or thirty minutes(Seemed like it for me)! The acting and plot(maybe there was a plot. Who knows?) got dumber and dumber until I turned the TV off. What I don't get is why this trash got so many positive reviews. There are better B-movies out there people!This is not one of them!"
2,Not the best but it was a fun to watch,The story has 8 beautifiul (well some were) models and their boss crashlanding with the plane they were on in the ocean. They all survive and find an island in the distance. They make it and explore the island finding (no not Polar Bears or a mysterious hatch with a button to push) but a dead scientist all up in a spider web. They seek shelter in a cabin place. Their manager wanders off by himself where he is attacked by a spider transforming him into (no not Spider-Man) but a creature. The girls all giggle and skinny dip and what not. Eventually they are accompanyed by some men who tell them that a boat will come back to the island in which case everyone will be rescused. But their spider bitten manager stalks them in the shadows. It has its fun moments. Especially those skinny dipping scenes. The effects are bad of course but I didnt mind it. Starring Harold Maresch.
3,Good but short,Very focused on 2 specific nutrients. Well researched. Worth the read to protect your heart. Hope more people will prevent rather than react to disease with this info.
2,Lame Performance,"The idea behind this DVD is a good one. Previn's commentary is illuminating without being too technical for non-musicians to understand. But the actual performance of Shostakovich's symphony does not do justice to the music. I can only guess that there was not adequate rehearsal prior to recording. There are problems with ensemble, phrasing, intonation and rhythm. Often the playing is not perfectly together, and the only musical conception in evidence is the desire to make it through without disaster. Previn is a fine conductor; I don't know why he would allow this inferior product to be issued. There is a terrific performance of this work on VHS, conducted by Leonard Bernstein; you might want to get that one instead. Also, I've seen notification that a (Cologne Music Triennale) DVD will be issued soon, so we may hope for better."
2,where is the shostakovich spirit,Andre Previn's rendition of Shostakovich's gripping 5th Symphony lacks in all most all areas of excitement or originality. There are frequently ensemble problems in the strings... the video even zooms up on a violinist in the last movement who cannot play the part. Also... the recording quality in this DVD is poor. Pitch wavers considerably. Phrasing in the winds is choppy. Save your money and buy one of the fine DVDs featuring Herbert von Karajan.
2,Bostich Staples,"I have a ""B300HD"" stapler that says on it that it uses ""SB35"" staples. The product description says that they are for a ""B310HDS"" stapler. I thought I would try to use them since no staples for the B300HD were offered. They tend to jam the stapler but work part of the time. More information about what would work would have helped me."
1,"distasteful, disgusting, fake, and unworthy of Victoria Holt","I deeply regret reading this ""novel"" if it can be called such. It is undoubtly disgusting, the plot it ugly and unnecessary. What bewilders me is that Minella, the heroine chooses a man so diabolical and evil. She seems like a sensible person, but obviously I shouldn't have judged her by her cover. The man she supposedly loves is so many years her senior, this fact sickens me, out of all the male characters in the book, she chooses the most wicked and detestable one. Also, this book seems to put down the French revolution as though it is a sinful event in history. I applaud the peasants who braved the aristocrats and wanted equality and independence. The poor were abused unjustly, the rich aware of the injustice were still careless and heartless. I still can't accept this book as a creation of Victoria Holt. All I have to say is what the heck happened???"
5,Suspenseful Romance during the French Revolution,"Wonderful, suspenseful romantic story. The Comte Fontaine Delibes makes you root for him even though you're not sure of the nature of his intentions. Also a good deal of history too since it takes place during the French Revolution. The Revolution seen through the eyes of an aristocrat is an interesting perspective and one not usually told. 18 year old Minella Maddox falls for the Comte even though it looks like he might have killed his wife. As the French Revolution is at its height Minella is swept in a dangerous adventure with the Comte's daughter who is also her best friend. Recommended to Victoria Holt readers and history nerds/hopeless romantics like me."
5,The Devil On Horseback,"This was the first Victoria Holt I have ever read, and I certainly plan to read more of them! Right from the start I became engrossed in the story, trimmed with interesting characters, a dramatic setting, and a solid, twisting plot. It is one I would highly recommend. Holts style of writing is so seamless and realistic that one gets an illusion that they are there. I liked it so much, I am in the middle of two more of her books ( The King of the Castle and The Black Opal) right now.Intriguing, engrossing novel!"
3,Not All That Tempting.,"I found this book to be one of Victoria Holts slowest and most plodding, but appreciated the historic background of the French Revolution. The title is deceiving, but I liked it a lot better than Song for a Nightingale which was disappointing in the end. If this is your first Holt novel, do yourself a favor and read On the Night of the Seventh Moon--you will be addicted!--or read the long, but fascinating account of Marie Antoinette's life, The Queen's Confession. It's a much better book about the same time frame than this one."
5,Love it,"I've read this several times and it's one of my favorite books. It has a fanciful plot, just like any of Victoria Holt's--how many governess types actually married European aristrocracy?--but I have to say I am always delighted by the Comte's character.I've read hundreds of romance novels where the hero is arrogant, handsome, and rich, but this Comte really convinces me. I guess you could call it a deft characterization. He begins subtly persuing Minella, using circumstances to his advantage. The picture of Paris during the outbreak of the revolution is fascinating and has similarities to A Tale of Two Cities. I would venture to say that Holt was inspired by that book and used a plot twist from it. The opressive atmosphere in the city as Minella waits out her Charles' fate is well done and there is a convincing amount of fear and dread."
1,Poor taste - Are you paid by a christian organization?,"Yesterday, I saw God's warriors about christian organization and Islamic organizations on CNN by Christian Amanpour. Christian missionaries have converted pooor pooooor people in front of my eyes in India, there are cheap cheap humans who tell lies that show on stage that cancer is cured, blind gets eye, people who were handicapped could walk after the stage drama etc. If it is all legal, if BJP or RSS opposes and if its illegal, then what is illegal to you is legal to us, in India.Shameless guy who wrote this should be part of the same network. Look at secret mix of religion and politics in legal system, in everything, in west and in middle eastern countries and then talk about India. No body is going to buy your piss poor taste book for 28$ for things that you write are in bad taste and also of things that new generation that do not even know or want to know. See how hinduism is reviving..."
1,i hope they close down,Never got the flowers ! DON'T EVER ORDER FROM THEM ! ONLY GAVE THEM ONE STAR TO MAKE REVIEW ! HOPE THEY CLOSE !
1,My Valentine's flowers order got canceled 1 day before the valentine's day,Never buy from this store. I placed my order for some valentine's day flowers the week before the valentine's day. And my order got canceled without reason on the day before valentine's day. This screwed up my plan and my schedule. I will never buy from this place again.
1,Canceled orders,"I placed 3 orders around Valentine's Day then to see them get canceled a little before. Luckily I'm such a good husband, I ordered more than one thing for my wife, and those things came on time (chocolate Hershey card). I'm not going to purchase from this place again."
1,Terrible,"I had the same experience as everyone else...the offer didn't exist...this is an excerpt from an email they sent me...""Due to a Technical problem we experience during the time you placed your order, which created a promotion, which in fact did not exist. We do apologize for this incontinence and hope you will understand all orders have been refunded.""I'm not sure who is running this company but I guess they want me to know they are incontinent."
1,Cancelled Ouder!!!,"I ordered these to be delivered for Valentine's Day.My order was cancelled, without receiving a cancelation notice.I checked my Amazon account, which states my account was reimbursed, but there is no explanation.There should be a way to rate a product/business at zero stars."
1,Very Very Bad Cheating Company,Very bad company and poor customer service. They waste my time and money. I will never do business with them again!
2,Bad experience from this seller!,"The flowers color were nice, but died in couple days. Tried to contact the seller, but couldn't get a hold of them. Will not buy from this seller again."
2,"All the songs you want, just not the recordings you want","This is a very nice collections of Drifters songs--all the songs a casual Drifters listener would need. But, they aren't the original recordings. If you've listened to these songs enough, you'll notice subtle differences that are just enough to throw the songs off. It's fine for background music, but it's missing part of what made me fall in love with the songs. From the reviews I've read of other Drifters albums, this seems to be a common problem with these older greatest hits collections. If you really care about the version of the songs you're getting, keep shopping."
5,The Drifters!,"I think this si a great cd! The Drifters are very talented. Their talent is displayed on this album. I love Under the Boardwalk, Up on the Roof, and On Broadway! These are songs that I grew up on."
1,HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT,"I have not yet received this CD, as I have not received the ""For Love Of Ivy"" DVD."
5,What a surprise,"I never HEARD of this guy, and leave it to WXPN in Philadelphia to introduce him to me. Instant like. He reminds me in some places of yes, John Hyatt, but also a little-known CD called The Fun Lovin' Criminals and 100% Columbian, with the smart, sophisticated kind of hip-hop urban feel. To learn that he's British, just blew me away. There is no END to what the Brits can turn out, and I love them for it."
4,Panthers has a bite!,"First time listening, I thought it was downright weird. ButTopley's distinctive voice won me over. Now, I can't get enoughand have ordered all of his CDs. Folky, but not too country orhillbillie. ..."
4,Sweet little item!,The description of this item was very accurate. Each piece is unique and works very well. I enjoy using it everyday!
4,More please,"This is a great disc and if I were to have one criticism that would be as 58 minutes it is too short. That aside, this is a very enjoyable DVD and I hope that many more compilations, or even better, complete editions of the show, will follow."
4,Great retrospective--but only 3 or 4 seasons represented,This is an excellent DVD that hightlights Andy's pick of what he felt were some of his best moments during his TV show broadcast from 1962 to 1971. This is excellent viewing material and just plain fun for both those who are starting to get to be familiar with Andy Williams' work as well as those taking a stroll down memory lane. The quality of the picture and sound is excellent and the guests are very talented people. My only disappointment was that maybe Andy could have added other moments from other seasons of his shows--the majority of the clips are from the years 1965 to 1967. I vote this as a BUY; and I would have given it five stars were there more moments from other seasons added. Maybe this calls for a volume two? GRIN
3,Gotta Love Andy,"I can't believe how great his show was. Since I wasn't born until 1967, I can't remember too much about seeing his show.. But, this Video will bring it back. I do think it should have been another hour long, since DVD's hold 2 or more hours on each one. I'm only giving it 2.5 stars, since it could have been twice as good if it was twice as long."
5,Minerals and stones,"The book is in very good condition, pity it is not what I had expected. I require a book on rocks and minerals, telling me what you would use each for, in the theraputic sense. can you help?Leo"
4,Great Likeness to Lupin,"This toy is a great likeness to Lupin in the movie. It is very durable as well. I like the ""Transformer"" nature of it. He can be Lupin and then change to a werewolf. The only thing I didn't like was that, at least on my figure, Lupin's head doesn't latch on to the back half of his body, so the front half of his body falls down if you move him too much. The wolf head latches, so that is not a problem there, but I would have liked his human head to latch as well."
1,Yuck!,"A friend owns this toy, and it's horrible! As a die-hard Lupin fan, I'd say there are about a million ways to make this toy better, starting with general product improvement. I mean, come on; the movie did Lupin and especially the wolf bad enough, but this toy is far worse! I can't believe any of the people who've reviewed have even read the book; maybe they've seen five-second clips of the movie. In conclusion, I'd say this is about the level of a McDonalds toy; ie something you throw out within ten minutes."
2,"Confusing, confusing, confusing",This book was very confusing. To me it sounded as if Eireann had 3 boyfriends and I couldn't follow along. Another reason I didn't like this book was because it would skip around and you got lost way to fast. I also didn't like the format how they used so many diiferent names for poems it added even more confusion to it. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you like to read very confusing books.
5,wow,"This is one of the best, if not THE best book i have ever read. As a teen, i related to her experiences....her account made me think and helped me to understand things. This woman truly had an astonishing experience and i thank her for sharing it with us in such a beautiful way!"
4,Intriguing and Uplifting,"This new poetic novel by Eireann Corrigan deals with some heavy issues. Like many edgy works today, this work addresses the main character's own struggle with anorexia and explores suicidal teens as well as many other difficult topics. What makes this work different is that it is true. It is the author's autobiography in verse and it is intensly moving. Corrigan speaks through short poetic vignettes that are strikingly candid and truthful. It isn't an easy book to read, but it is captivating. I really reccomend it."
3,It was not the best book ever!,You Remind Me of You by Eirann Corrigan is a book about a troubled teen who is aneroxic. This book is based off the authors trials and tribulations. Her boy friend Daniel shoots himself between the eyes. He does not pass away.The narroter helps him survive which makes her want to survive too.I thought that this book was good but not amazing. It was confusing and I did not know what happend by the end. I do not reconmend this book.It was boring at someparts and not the overall best best book I have ever read.
3,Nice and Middle-of-the-Road,"The wood is very nice and its size is perfect. There is no grind setting so you had better like fine-ground pepper if you want this mill. The metal cap screw comes loose every now and then. No big whoop. Its a nice mill for the cost. A good value, but nothing too fancy. Am going to buy another one for salt very soon."
1,Talking Watch,"This watch was attractive, however, the settings did not work properly. Both my husband and I tried repeatedly to set the time and date according to the provided instructions. I contacted the original company, they sent a pre-postage envelope, I returned the product and my credit card billing was adjusted immediately."
4,I Think You Should Know,"By far the best UK guitar group in that period between The Smiths and the Stone Roses. Guy Chadwick has one of the most soothing voices in rock, which when combined with Terry Bicker's spine-tingling guitar produces some moments of pure pop beauty.As well as their most famous songs like Christine and Destroy The Heart, this CD also contains some of their lesser known tracks, like the unbelievably gorgeous Girl With The Loneliest Eyes. My only quibble with this compilation is the selection of some of the later tracks chosen over far better earlier stuff, but as an introduction to one of the most underrated bands ever, this CD does the job just fine."
5,Real Alternative,"This kind of band is definetively why its worth paying for a CD instead of downloading. HOL brought to the world of music songs with charisma, passion, melody and energy. On top of that, their lyrics have something to say about life. Drown the soul/and through the eyes/You'll see a future/so cold and lonely/Hunt the tiger/and kill the jungle/how money cooks/inside us all/ (You don't Understand): That's something few bands make as equal exciting in poetry. As others have said, they're an underrated band, but that made them sort of underground, which is why HOL is a real treasure planet Earth has yet to discover."
2,La logique de la quantité contre la noblesse de qualité,"La réalisation de l'ouvrage n'est pas très réussie. La couverture a l'air d'avoir été bricolée; ce constat est flagrant quand on la retire du livre. Le rendu de l'objet est trop lisse et trop vide à mon got. Il manque à la réalisation plastique de cet ouvrage la texture et le grain que l'on retrouve dans les images de Jeff Burton. La logique de la quantité qui prévaut sur la qualité semble avoir été ce qui a motivé la maison d'édition de cet ouvrage. Je retrouve malgré cela, l'esthétique des images du photographe mais reste insatisfait."
4,"Good mix of songs, good value with 20 hits on one disc","You can't please everybody, of course, but this 20-song compilation of hits from the 1990s comes pretty close. Many ""greatest hits"" discs only cover 10-12 songs, but this includes twenty big ones, from the soul-baring ""Nothing Compares 2U"", to the inescapable ""Two Princes"" by Spin Doctors. If you heard it on the radio in the 90s you'll hear it here. Recommended."
5,outstanding!,This one really rocks! My very favorite Joan Jett album. Every song on here is fantastic. Cherry Bomb and Road Runner are my favorites. No CD collection would be complete without this. A must for driving and just plain rockin' out!
3,"It Gets my three (stars),barely","overall not a bad release. still, it doesn't hold one candle to the magic of ""Bad Reputation""."
3,"No Road Runner here, but lots of fiddle","Everyone pretty much agreed at the time(mid-'84)that this wasn't one of JJ's best records, and time has been no kinder. The reviewer for Creem Magazine said about ""Push & Stomp"": 'It does neither'. He was right. ""I Got No Answers"", however, is probably Joan's best song(next to ""Nitetime"" from ALBUM)and ""Hold Me"" is a nice ballad(although Joan herself dissed it a few years later in a magazine article). Not the best place to begin a Joan Jett CD collection--even the bonus tracks are rote."
2,disappointed,"The 3cd collection includes Toy Story which I can`t comment on as it would not work, A Bugs Life which I thought had below average graphics and gameplay and Tarzan the best out of the 3, quite good, and the only one my 5yr old grandson enjoyed."
1,Very Disappointed In This Book,"As a Human Resources Professional, I was looking forward to adding a book specifically about hiring salespeople to my library. After receiving this book I was very disappointed to discover that there is little in it that specifically applies to sales hiring. Most of the information in it is generic hiring and interviewing skills that anyone who is in Human Resources should know. This is not a sales recruiting resource despite what it claims. If you are new to hiring and interviewing I suggest picking up an Recruiting and Retaining Employees for Dummies. It gives you everything this book does and provides a much better reference for overall recruiting."
1,not as advertised,The photo and description of this watch stated and showed it came with the fast wrap band on Amazon.com. My main purpose of ordering this watch was the fast wrap band. The watch came with a buckle type band which I can not use. The watch is being returned. I was very disappointed with Amazon. com.
4,Page tuner A++,"I was looking for a good quick read book. This was it you can picture what was going on in the book. Good descrpition. It makes you think about if this did happen, how would you make it back to your love ones??I also recommend77 daysOne second afterPatriots"
4,nice read,Nice easy read. Starts out moving and keeps moving. Good 'personal journey' book.Well worth the couple of bucks paid. Looked forward to getting back to it.
4,Couldn't put it down,Well written and thoroughly enjoyable. Easy to get lost in -- I'd give myself 5 minutes of reading as a break and found nearly every time that my 5 minute break turned into 30 minutes.
5,Can't stop thinking about this book!,"I use to live in CA, so much of what Marty walked through was very familiar - which might have lead to my enjoyment of this book. I really had a hard time putting this down (I know, sounds so cliche), but it is true. The evolution of Marty's character was well done. I didn't mind the flipping back and forth from present to his past, but if you hate that kind of thing, you might think twice about purchasing this book. The end was a surprise - not was I expected at all. Overall, a very good, enjoyable book which I do recommend."
4,A Good Diversion,"If you need something to read while traveling, or to pass the time, take you away for a few hours, walking through LA with the main character after the Big One will do it for you. Like any walk, there are highs and lows but getting home is always a relief."
4,A good disaster read with engaging characters and good writing,"Just the premise -- a man walking across Los Angeles after the ""Big One"" makes it worth reading, but what keeps you reading is the fascinating character of the protagonist and his erstwhile buddy and pain in the you know what who keeps him moving and causes him to question what and who he is. The book playfully relates itself to disaster movies by making the main character a ""script reader"" and editor for Hollywood. The transformation of a phony hollywood story treatment editor into ... well... a hero is a striking story that is worth reading. Especially for the price. It's kind of amazing this isn't a movie because I think it would be a good one."
4,The Walk by Lee Goldberg,"Pretty good reading. Interesting and a surprise ending which i like in books. I would buy and read additional books written by this author, Lee Goldberg."
1,Waste of time,"Initially I thought the story was entertaining (even if a bit far-fetched reality wise), but quickly got tired of the overuse of the F word and other inappropriate language. I am not someone who is offended by the use of the occasional use of swearing in a book, but this book was just disgusting in the amount of profanity that was used. In spite of that, I decided to keep reading and hoped for a good ending. The main character keeps encountering problem after problem and eventually it just became unbelievable. Yes there would be some extreme situations in the event of an earthquake, but in my opinion, the author went way overboard in the number and severity of the situations. And the ending was extremely disappointing. I'm glad I did not pay for this book, as I would've been tempted to ask for a refund. There are millions of books to read, and based upon this book, I would not buy or even download another book from this author."
4,Highly Entertaining,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. No boring parts for me, in fact it was hard for me to put down. Great plot! Good humor throughout.(Warning for the faint-hearted: One of the characters uses the F word a lot!) Towards the end, I had an inkling where the story line might be leading, but you never know for sure... and PART of the plot ended in a psychological surprise. It was fabulous to see Marty step up to the plate and meet the challenges that confronted him, and there were MANY. I recommend it."
4,Solid Effort,"I went into this book assuming it was another self-published work that would have sloppy syntax, a poor writing style and little or no editing. After the first two pages I looked up the author's credits and discovered he is a top flight screen writer. The book reads like a movie, which is to be expected from an author with his pedigree.While the writing was superior, and the style was humorous and well paced, the story was a bit of a let down. Having expected a self-published book, I also expected more gun play and violence. Where were the gangs? Where was the danger? The afterword explains that the author had, in fact, made a similar walk after the Northridge quake. So his embellished story was much more accurate than my own imagination expected.Overall a solid effort and a quick read."
4,Enjoyable Disaster Book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great plot and good development of the characters. They were realistic, believable, and seemed like real people.The story makes you think about if it were you walking back home - what would you do? Could you stop and help everyone who needs it, or would you want to rush home to check on loved ones?A great character study, one that makes you think, but one that also has danger, excitement and lot's of interesting references to the television industry and familiar California landmarks.This book kept my attention all the way through, but was also fun to read at the same time."
1,Foul foul foul.. had to quit. Don't waste your time.,"After reading the good reviews, I tried The Walk. The story started with a bang but fizzled out in just a few pages. Additionally, the writers wording style seems adolescent at best. It also appears that he has a limited use of the English language so he has to revert to a great deal of foul language. When I got to the part where the Marty was eating the burrito I had to give up. There was more foul language in one paragraph than most books have in an entire book.Don't bother with this book. It's not worth it."
1,Horrible,Not only has my time been wasted but my intelligence has been insulted. I guessed the so called plot twists immediately. The writing was cliche and trite. I honestly am shocked that anyone could give this book more than one star. Too bad there isn't a zero star option. My daughter's 7th grade comp teacher has a term for this type of drivel...WORD VOMIT! Don't waste your time!!!!
3,Walked a few chapters too far,"THe book was entertaining, however, the walk back home could have ended much sooner and still had the same effect."
3,Skip it!,"What concerned me were the many errors in this book - the most glaring that the hero headed into the San Fernando Valley and turned east to go home to Calabassas. No, you have to go west - and the walk he did would have taken much longer. Maybe I'm being too picky, but the author took literary license on too many events. Happy I didn't pay for this one.Skip it if you have to pay for it."
2,Not believable,"I've read alot of apocalyptic books but this one did not come close to being believable to me. The story lacks alot of meat and is boring. The ending is just plain weird. If you want to read engaging stories, try ""Patriots"", ""One Second After"" or ""Lights Out""."
2,Stilted writing,"I am always on the look out for a great survival story. However, this book was mediocre at best. There is no real character development. In fact, it all feels like a made-for-TV-movie. The writing is very predictable and stilted, almost like there was a template being followed."
2,Horrible dialogues,"So I got this book for free and since the reviews were ok I gave it a chance... I was not impressed. The dialogues are very poor and not ""real"" at all. The whole Fight Club thing about the alter ego it made me disappointed and the end seemed like he just got really lazy and went with the easier route. I never write reviews but with this one it just seemed necessary. The book is not horrible but is not something I would recommend either."
1,Truly Bad Book,I gave this book 1 star becaue zero wasn't available. Truly regret the money and time wasted on this book that seems like it was written in 2 hours and was intended to be a 10th rate script for an even worse made for TV movie. It really isn't about disaster - that is a secondary sub-plot to the main character constantly whining about his life. Would never buy another book by the author.
3,Ok Book,"This book isn't the end of the world survivalist book I thought it was. It's about a local tragedy and the journey to get home and survive. Not what I was looking for, I didn't feel it had any survivalist tips."
2,Don't waste your time or money.,"Amateurish writing. You REALLY have to try very hard to suspend your disbelief with this one. Suitable for only those who are easily entertained and don't pay attention to details. Goldberg's other books were at least (at times) humerous. This one is a stinker. But hey, if you're easily entertained........"
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"After the Big One hits Los Angeles, a television network executive strives to walk across the city to return home to his wife. This man comes to terms with his meek little nature and how he changes as he continues his journey across a devastated city. This was a well thought out book and very descriptive as how people may react after such a natural disaster. It's very enjoyable and I'd recommend this book to anyone."
3,So So,"It started good. It became a meandering walk along from one disaster to another. In between was not very engaging. I found myself skipping what I felt was filler. Not the best book, I read."
4,enjoyable,"If you are looking for highbrow literature - this ain't it. If you want a fun read and are willing to suspend disbelief at some of the improbable events and downright inaccuracies of the book, I say give this one a shot. (This applies even more if you are familiar with LA - I think he made a few mistakes but gets most of the local places and vibes right.)"
2,Could've been good,"I liked the premise, but I really didn't like how the author carried it out. Others have mentioned spoilers, and I agree about the ending. Just didn't care for it, and didn't really like the characters all that much either."
2,2 stars because it made me laugh once,"Not the best book I have ever read by a long way. Decent enough premise for a story, but irritating resolution. Suitable for a plane journey when mental chewing gum is required."
3,Unbelievable occurances,"The premise for the book is great, and at the start it's very interesting but then the author decided to have this one character (don't want to ruin it) pop up and it's just ridiculous how this continues to happen. Completely unbelievable. Oh well thought it might turn out to be a good disaster book."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this was a novel about disaster preparedness. I was sadly mistaken. In many ways, it was a very bad knock off of the Fight Club/Shutter Island genre where things are not as they seem and after the ""surprise ending"" nothing meshes or makes sense.As far as emergency preparedness goes, the only thing you might learn from this book is make sure you are in good enough shape to run and scream at the same time.Cheap entertainment at best."
2,The walk is just ok,"The book is well written but is slow, I kept waiting for it to pick up. I thought the twist at the end was anti-climatic and ruined the book. I would not buy it again."
2,Lame ending,"This review will give away part of the book, but you won't be missing anything.Two things bugged me about the book. The first was that ""Buck"" kept randomly appearing when ""Marty"" was in his greatest moments of need. The second thing, which bugged me the most, was WHY ""Buck"" was always at the right place, at the right time, saying the right things- ""Buck"" was a figment of ""Marty's"" imagination. Lame. Like ""Fight Club"", but less psychotic.The only redeeming quality of this book is the depiction of mayhem that would envelop LA in the event the city was crippled by a cataclysmic earthquake.2 stars."
2,Wasted Potential,"I was really excited about this book. Time and again I tried to overlook the weak writing and the huge flaws in the plot. I finished the book and the ""surprise ending"" just added more frustration. More than anything I was disappointed that the book really wasted such great potential."
4,The Walk,"This book provided an interesting look into the main charactor's mind as he walked home across an earthquake devistated Los Angeles. While entertaining through out, the book had a great hook at the end! A fun read."
4,Engaging with a twist at the end,"Simple enough decision: walk home to the wife after earthquake flattens your city. But it's not that easy, is it? A great story line, with an insightful glimpse into the internal dilemmas of an, initially, unlikable character. Well written and intriguing, engaging reader with just enough unexpected but challenging encounters to keep the pages turning."
4,Give it a try.,"I passed this book by in the kindle store; then a friend said ""You should read it!"". I don't like disaster novels, but with that encouragement I decided to give ""The Walk"" a try. As soon as Buck (whom I would call the character in the best supporting role) came on the scene, the story became laugh-out-loud funny whenever he was around. Although much of the time I felt I was being treated to a tongue-in-cheek travelogue, it's obvious that Mr. Goldberg is a talented and very clever author with a gift for dialogue. I will definitely try some of his other novels. If you don't particularly like reading about natural disasters, ""Give it a try"" anyway."
4,Much Better Than I Expected,"I tend to loathe narcissistic Hollywood/Wall Street types who have hyper-inflated views of their importance in the world, so I am impressed that the author made me care about one. This novel is a quick, engaging read and I hope the author explores this world again. It would be interesting to see what a post- earthquake LA would be like..."
4,An entertaining read,"I really enjoyed this book. It seems to me that the ending was rather abrupt, but overall it was well worth my money and time. I will be seeking other titles by Lee Goldberg."
3,Entertaining but not a classic,"This is a throw away paperback, entertaining but no real substance. Virtually no character development. But that said I enjoyed it and am glad I read it"
3,The Walk,"I am sort of contractually bound to review this book, as I received a free copy of the e-book on condition I write a review of it. Just so you know where I'm coming from...Once upon a time I was an editor of an e-zine and had to inform erstwhile authors of my reaction to their submissions. My standard line for rejections was ""it didn't grab me"".This book didn't grab me. The first part seems overblown -- written by someone trying to grab your attention (and, in my case, failing to do so).It sort of mellows out later on, but by then I was just skimming paragraphs and pages, looking for something to pay attention to. It has the feeling of a book looking to be a movie.However: I can see this being a fascinating read for folks not steeped in science fiction memes. I would not recommend against buying it for a quick read of an evening.Mr. Goldberg has written many books since this one, and I've enjoyed his writing. This one just didn't grab me."
1,Disappointing walk,"The book started off well. It was interesting and had mild language. The deeper into the book the filthier the language. Not necessary for a good story. Put it down, won't pick it back up. Will avoid Lee Goldberg in the future. Agree with another review that Amazon needs to devise a system of rating that tells when books have this kind of language or other ""adult content""."
2,"Potentially good, beginning was very interesting.","This was a potentially good book with a gripping beginning. Unfortunately, I chose to stop reading it because of the way-too-often-used ""f-word."" I know sometimes there is no other way, and to hear it once or twice would not have impeded my reading. But it was simply used way too often in the first few chapters for me. It's too bad; I think I would've enjoyed it."
5,A memorable one day read.,"Picked this book up with a little time to kill, and spent the rest of the day finishing it! A little trashy in places, a little far-fetched, a little sad and a LOT funny as hell. A story that might help to remind what is, and isn't, important when bad things disrupt the routine."
4,"Not Great, but Pretty Good!","Wish I could make this 3 1/2 stars, because in my opinion it is better than just O.K. & I did like reading it, but as far as 4 stars ~ that may be stretching it a bit. First off, this is not the type of book that I normally read. Chalk it up to broadening my horizons! That said, I found it to be a compelling story, actually hard to put down and even funny in a few places. There were even a few twists that I did not see coming. I'm glad I read it & would recommend it as an entertaining escapist book."
3,meh...,"3.5Somewhat memorable adventure story, not bad, but kind of a sing-song ending (with a few hoaky parts).If you are looking for something to read in the 'survival genre', there are certainly worse books than this one (but will not make my personal 'top-ten list').What I liked:descriptive atmosphere.changing, moving scenerygoal-oriented plot with several interesting scenes throughout.man-against-the-impossible situationcharacter developmentWhat I disliked:the main character(s)character development (I know, I wrote this twice) To me, this aspect would have benefitted from a softer touch."
3,Not the greatest book I ever read...,"However - I did find it interesting in a weird sort of way. My overall impression was on the warm side of lukewarm, but the end???? - all I could think was ""you've got to be kidding""!!! I would recommend it, as it is somewhat off the beaten path - if that peaks your interest."
4,The Walk,"took me by surprise I don't normally stay up all night to finish a novel but I did with this one, there was some dark humor moments that had me laughing out loud but there were also some slow parts that I read through quickly. The main character is annoying and timid until you reach the end of the book. Which is why I loved, loved, loved the ending totally makes you rethink your disaster plan."
1,Hated this book,"Why oh why does an author feel he must fill up his book to make it longer by using the F word?? I bought this book hoping to learn something from it. Okay, I learned you had better be prepared because disaster can happen instantly when you least expect it. There. I thought the book sucked. Waste of my precious time and money reading/buying it. There are so many other disaster books you can actually walk away with some good ideas from on the market that are soooo much better than this book. Don't waste your money."
1,the walk...away,"Take a ""B"" movie and make it into a book. I endured up to 25% of the ""The Walk"" before putting it down. The banality just goes on and on with nothing developing but Marty walking LA with his gym bag,like watching paint dry."
3,Interesting Read!,Not a literary masterpiece but it kept me interested and gave somewhat of a surprise at the end! Not to bad but not the best either!
3,the Walk totally predictable,"The Walk was chosen for it's quick readability for our Dec book group by a post apocalyptic fan. It delivered a quick read but much like the TV Shows Mr. Goldberg writes for it was totally predictable. In fact, in many ways it was Hallmark meets SyFy. Not unenjoyable but lacking the satisfying rebuilding of a great post apocalyptic novel."
4,A Fun Post-Quake Romp Through Hell A,"This is a fun, albeit short, read that chronicles the adventures of one Marty Slack as he decides to hoof it back to Calabasas from downtown LA. Marty goes through some evolutionary changes during his trek, as does every character who answers The Call to Advenuture. Since Marty is a TV producer, he's automatically not a very sympathetic character, but I found his odyssey sufficiently distracting. I deducted a star for the use of a strongly telegraphed plot reveal near the end of the book, but other than that, reading this novel is time well spent."
3,None,"Well written story. Could have been great. The main character never grew on me though. I found him an irritating pansy who lacked any real emotion. His last ""obstacle"" was way over the top. Overkill. While not surprising, the ending created holes in the storyline for me."
1,The Walk,"The Walk ....bad bad bad...don't buy it....Extremely far fetched, not well written at all. Not even worth the two dollars spent on it.."
4,good long walk,"I really liked this book. I could identify many of the locations and that made it scarier to read. Not quite a ""couldn't put it down"" but it certainly held my interest."
3,bad language,this could have been a good book if the author could have found some way to express himself without using foul and coarse language.
5,A Great Humanity Story,"This was an entertaining story of what many on the west coast of the U.S. fear...The Big One. The main character, Marty, is a believable victim in a destroyed Los Angeles area who is simply trying to get to his home on foot and hopes that his wife is still alive. The journey that is ""The Walk"" will leave you stunned, happy and even tearful. This is an excellent book and you won't want to put it down once you start!The Walk"
5,excellent book in the survival fiction genre,"Lee Goldberg penned a wonderful story interwoven with superb character development and a smooth plot that pulls the reader along at a very fast pace. The lead character, Marty Slack must deal with much more than mother nature on his journey to get home from downtown Los Angeles to his home outside the city. He has tied in elements of survival fiction that leaves the reader wondering what they would do in the event of a major catastrophic collapse of society, whether it be an economic, terrorist, or natural disaster. The plot is on overly done on survival details, rather it tells the story of a man who is only slightly prepared to embark on the journey, and shows some important lessons along the way.This one is a must in your survival library, along with One Second After, and Patriots."
3,decent book felt slightly like an infomercial,"Thanks for formatting this into Kindle format - it made the read more enjoyable. There are still some typos but they aren't that numerous.Overall this is a good book, but not great. The story gets sidelined a few times with long reminisces about the protagonist's current and past life. The earthquake plot seemed pretty real. But all the odd encounters and situations that occurred would make for great TV/movie but in reality they probably wouldn't all occur to an individual.There is a plot revelation at the end that I won't give out. A lot of the things in the book don't play out very well if you go back and apply them with the relevation in mind - which is inconsistent.Overall a solid effort, but didn't quite strike home for me."
2,walk away,A very shallow plot line overly involved with the Los Angeles geography and less involved with the characters. The book reads like a script for a TV show that didn't make it.
4,Solid afternoon read,"If you are expecting something like The Stand, don't bother. But if you enjoy books with a decent plot, somewhat believable situations and a willingness to read it without the judgment of a book reviewer, you will be pleasantly surprised.I enjoy TEOTWAWKI type books, even if the situations may be a stretch. The author does a really good job turning the reader's opinion of the main character from distain to admiration. This is the common man's story. Haven't you thought about how you would truly react and behave when confronted with a grave disaster? Do you ever wonder if you have what it takes to survive? Would you stop and help a stranger, even if it means you may lose your life? If so, you will enjoy this book. The moral of the story may stay with you and be the thing that inspires you to be the person, or hero, you want, or need, to be when you least expect it."
4,Maximum Enjoyment,"Download this now. Skip the trial version and just pay the minor price of admission. My passion is apocalyptic movies and books, but usually focus on zombies or nuclear destruction. Lee Goldberg takes on a natural disaster with the same kind of intensity I've found in those other genres and leaves me happily fulfilled.I love the idea of being one of the few left on this planet left to pick up the pieces and move on. In this book you see the first part of that... the roaming around, discovering life is no longer what it once was."
4,Great book for a great price,"Wow! What a nice surprise!This book is exciting and entertaining, with just enough graphic content to be realistic but not over the top. For a while I was concerned about the inclusion of a certain character, but the ending made this guy make more sense. And the writer clearly used his on-the-ground knowledge of both L.A. and the television business to great effect.Not to be missed if you are interested in post-apocalyptic story telling."
2,Pedestrian,"I just did not find the characters likable or the least bit engaging. I gave up and stopped reading it about half way through. On the plus side, it is pretty well written and I would consider this author again."
3,Interesting premise,"Was easy to read, kept my interest. Storyline was plausible after an earthquake. The story takes you from the moment the big one came, through aftershocks and the sights you might see along the way along with possible problems you might encounter while trying to escape the city. When you get to the final chapter you will see what it is really all about."
1,The Walk,"After reading ""Lights Out"" this was one of the suggestions I was given. The book was more about his marriage and his failures then about survival. I was looking for more of a survival book. I did not care for it at all and wished I had not read it."
3,mildly interesting...,"Book was mildly interesting, but seemed to have every cliche you would associate with an earthquake in it. Character development was spotty."
1,Barf!,"Joe Polooka goes Hollywood.Crash,Boom,Pow Gasp!Unending terror and catastrophy overwhelm every page. Unrelenting angst populates each chapter. A complete catalog of pulp fiction crammed into one disappointing misadventure.Save your time and money."
1,Didn't grab me at all,"If you know LA then you might find the lengthy descriptions of downtown streets and buildings in ruins riveting but I did not. In fact, I found myself skimming through paragraphs looking for something that might grab my attention. Also way too much swearing for my liking."
5,WOW!!!,An amazingly believable look into a major earthquake in CA and how one man rose to the challenge of surviving and finding himself to be a better person than he imagined. Wonderful twist at the end.
5,"Oh my, what have I stumbled upon","I found this album listening to Pandora's ""Devendra Banhart"" station. The song Dear Old Robin came on and it blew my mind. The next day I bought the whole album, and I've listened to it 80 times (according to my iTunes play count) since. My wife and kids have nearly all of the songs' words memorized. I haven't enjoyed an album this much since Bon Iver's first album. It has the long-lasting playability that I got out of the Beatle's White Album, Dylan's Basement Tapes (the Dylan songs, not the Band's songs), Devendra Banhart's Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon or Andrew Bird's Weather Systems.I can't get enough. I also can't believe this guy isn't massively famous.My favorites on this album:-The Ivy-Safe Travels-The Highway-The Bonsai Tree-The Apple Tree-Dear Old Robyn-Silent MoviesBuy it, Buy it! BUY IT!"
2,MJB,I did not like the cd because MJB is not singing the songs on the cd. I did not know it would be someone else singing the song
4,Forro from Rio,"Actually, the style of music is from the Northeast of Brazil, but this is a compilation of the best bands playing in Rio de Janeiro at the height of latest Forro wave there circa 1998. All these bands played at the shows and parties hosted by Projeto Raizes, whose goal was to honor and promote traditional Brazilian culture, particularly that from the Northeast. Highlights are the tracks played by Forrocacana and the more traditional Trio Forrozao, plus Ze do Rock as played by Forro Paratodos."
1,Complete junk,"Don't even consider buying this.... Alf is trying so hard to cash in on the Beatles, it is rediculous. Alf retells his really pointless stories while the viewer looks at crappy stock footage. You get to see Paul solo for a few minutes but that's about it. I am a die hard Beatles fan who thought there wasn't any bad Beatles related merchandise. This video proved me wrong."
1,push drill set,It's so cheap you can't get the drill bits to stay in they are so cheap they break if you put any pressure on them.IT a PRODUCT I WOULDN'T TELL PEOPLE TO BUY it's CHEAP and there isn't a real use for the unless your working with real light wood to build airplane with.
1,way too small,This thing is way too small for anything. The drill bits are like needles. I have no idea what I can use it for so I tossed it in the trash. I wish I had read more about it. Big waste of my money.
4,Good Collection,"Album one starts with a medley with the first song being ""Give Thanks."" From there it transitions into""Let the Redeemed/Ah Lord God/What a Mighty God."" Other medleys are included in the set. Several individual songs are mixed in also. ""Heal Our Land"" and ""To Him Who Sits on the Throne"" are particularly inspiring.On the second album medleys are also interspersed with individual selections. ""God Will Make a Way"" is one of my favorites. Another excellent song is ""I Want to Be Where You Are.""There is fluctuation between easy listening and loud, up tempo selections, therefore this collection doesn't lend itself to background music for medidation or sleep as effectively as other collections. If you're looking for variety you'll find it here."
3,boring,"Concerning Newman's 'work' i am not able to reply very precisely except that his writings are almost completely passed over; and that is what i wished to know. On the other side, it is a beautiful book with marvelous photos. Put me to sleep."
4,Pay attention to what you're buying !!!,"I like this collection, 48 great fifties songs on 4 CD's. Audio quality is excellent! There were only about 200 ""hit"" songs recorded in the 50's, so here we have about 25% of them.But notice the shortage of big stars in this compilation. No Elvis, no Buddy Holly, no Fats Domino, no Little Richard, no Rick Nelson, etc.Also notice the shortage of rock 'n' roll like ""Blue Suede Shoes"" and ""Great Balls of Fire"". This compilation has an awful lot of teen pop like ""Eddie My Love"" and ""Sixteen Candles"".This may be exactly the compilation that you're looking for; but you won't know for sure unless you're really paying attention."
3,Relaxing but,It's repetitive for being 45 minutes i was thinking more along the lines of white noise when I set my TV sleep timer after hard days
3,not as good as other HD moods titles,"i also have HD moods Aquarium and Fire: both of those blu-rays have fixed-camera postions, with ""live"" content on them. meaning that the fireplace looks like a real fireplace, and the aquarium looks like a real fish tank.this particular HD moods blu ray has a moving camera, so while the picture is stunning and its fun to look at, it ends up feeling like a boring documentary with no comentary."
4,Pretty good soundtrack,"This cd has mostly just heavy metal music,but it works just like it did in the movie.The soundtrack has some good songs like Track 3 Shapes by Alcohol Funnycar and Track 9 Thunder Kiss 65 by White Zombie also as the main title score done by George S Clinton who did the score to the Austin Powers movies.This soundtrack may not be for everyone,but it's just right for me."
1,cardinals 06 highlights,ordered 04/26/07. It is now 05/21/07 still have not received product and no response e-mailed !!! My credit card is billed. Still Waiting!!!!
2,STONE IN THE GARDEN,"BEAUTIFUL IN FACT SPECTACULAR PHOTOS. MORE OF A COFFE TABLE BOOK. AUTHOR ASSUMES THAT ONE HAS THE LOWER SKILLS OF CONSTUCTING STONE WALLS, WALK WAYS PATHS. HE GIVE GREAT IDEAS BUT GENERAL DIRECTION IS NOT THERE."
3,Found a way,"Ok this did not work for me, so I ordered from another company and guess what, I got the same product, I figured out if I put two of these non working connectors together that it would work. Go figure. Obviously you cannot connect two of this exact connector together, you will need another type that completes the connections to the phone. what I believe happens is the 1rst adaptor reverses the mic wires and causes that not to work adding the second reverses the wires yet again and bam now the mic works."
1,Not a True 2.5mm Female to 3.5mm Male Adapter,"I purchased from [...]Completely useless as a true adapter.This is a Female 2.5mm to Male 3.4mm TRS connector - Tip, Ring, and Sleeve.Well, the one I received was wired backwards!The female Tip connects to the Male Ring.The female Ring connects to the Male Tip.See the problem? It reverses the polarity.Now this may work for certain cell phones headsets. but it didn't work as an adapter.I've already wasted enough time to bother returning it."
5,Great product!,I purchased my adapter from Eforcity and received it a day before the start date of the delivery estimate. This headset adapter allows me to plug in my headset with my cell phone in order to listen to my favious music.
5,true and tragic political history.,"I WAS ASTONISHED TO READ AN AMERICAN SO CONSCIOUS OF EUROPEAN EVENTS,PARTICULARLY THE ARTLESS COLD WAR ANTICS OF AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE. HIS DESCRIPTION OF WHAT LEAD TO THE ""COLONELS"" REVULUTION IN GREECE SHOWS INCREDIBLE INSIGHT ON US GREEKS."
2,Great price but not enough information provided in listing,"I purchased this battery as a spare for my JVC Everio camcorder, but it was too large for my camcorder. And no receipt or return policy was provided in the package, there appears to be no way of returning it and getting a refund. I would highly encourage anyone to only purchase this battery if the number on the battery itself matches the information provided by the seller. Because in this case I wasted $15 (between the cost of the battery and the shipping), which was partly my own fault for assuming that as the battery was advertised for Everio camcorders that it would fit, but partly the sellers fault for not providing more information in the listing.I do think if you know for sure that this battery will fit that it's a good buy if you don't mind waiting a week or two to receive it."
4,Worked as described,1st battery was DOA. Got a Battery not compatible error.Sent product back for a replacement. Replacement unit worked without any issue. I had to pay for the shipping of the defective product :(
2,JVC Battery DOA.,"The shipper emailed me upon receipt of the purchase request to ensure that I had the correct battery for my video camera type! I thought, great customer service.(check 1) The battery arrived in a timely manner. (check 2) Unfortunately, the battery holds less of a charge than the one I have had for three years. I'm contacting the vendor to see what they will do to compensate me. I'll repost a comment if my matter is handled satisfactorily. So far.. 2 star rating."
4,Standard JVC Battery - Recommended,"The JVC BN-VF808 battery is the same type that shipped with myJVC Everio GZ-HM200 Dual SD High-Def Camcorder (Black). This battery is rated for about 1.5 hours of use, but has lasted for just over 1 hour for me.The battery fully charged in about 2 hours the first time.If size isn't important, you may want to considerJVC BN-VF815US 1460-mAh Rechargeable Data Battery for JVC MiniDV and Everio Camcorders, which lasts for about 2.5 hours. The BN-VF815 is about 1/2"" larger and I have posted pictures showing the difference between these two batteries.Recommended as a spare or replacement battery."
1,Do not buy,Do not buy this item it does not even provide one hour of power to the JVC Everio series. You would have to plug your camcorder twice a day if you're travelling.
4,Its a battery,"It is a battery, and works with the JVC camcorder i have. Not a whole lot else i wanted."
4,JVC battery (bn-vf808us),"delivery was fast. the battery work just fine. just don't know how long it'll hold ""charge."" i may order more items from amazon... if the price is right.thanks, lorelex2"
3,"my avian vet said this is not a ""true pellet diet""","I talked to my avian vet cause i had my green cheeked conure on this diet. the vet said that this is not a true pellet diet and That it is extruded, meaning it is heated to high temps to ""gelatinize"" the food. Notice when in water it feels like a sponge. He also said that kaytee exact organic does not respond well in a bird's GI tract and causes the stool to be ""sticky"". He suggested a true pellet diet, either Lafeber's or Roudybush, and these two types are the only true pellet diets in the market. I switched Perry to Lafebers daily parrot diet and he loves it even more. I didnt even had to do a conversion. His stool is better now and my vet noticed improvements on this muscle mass after a while on lafebers. He said kaytee exact is not at all the worst food, since extruded bird food is still better than a seed diet."
2,Clumsy and awkward,"For a musical play like Die Fledermaus actors who sing are very much to be prefered to singers who try to act! Besides, filmed theater has very serious limitations.My ideal Fledermaus is the magnificent movie made in Color in Vienna just before the end of WWII. The soundtrack was lost but after the end of the war the cast was reassembled and the soundtrack was recorded anew. I saw the movie several times in Zürich in about 1948. I would dearly love to see it again. None of the performances I have seen since can compare.The treatment of an opera as a movie was in 1951 used by William Powell and Emeric Pressburger in their great Tales of Hoffmann. Perhaps they had seen Fledermaus?"
1,Hated It ...,"Okay, so the singing was beautiful, but the production was awful. The sets were dull, the costumes were boring, and the sentimental stuff in the middle of the party was just poor theater."
5,"with all due respect to Dame Joan,buy this for the Fledermau","Although most of the reviewers refer to Joan Sutherland farewell party and her guests,I I bought this DVD for Die Fledermaus performance.Actually I usually skip over the Joan Sutherland farewell party when I watch this DVD.This is a very good and enjoyable production of the Fledermaus.The singing is in English and there are also subtitles in English.Good music,a lot of fun,good singers.Enjoy it!And in addition you get to see and hear as a bonus Joan Sutherland and her guests-wow!"
5,A pleasure and a (painless) education,"This is the kind of book on Wall Street I have waited years for. First, the writing is terrific; too rare a treat in books on stocks and markets. Second, the anecdotes and examples, while highly instructional, can stand alone as exciting tales - you needn't even be interested in Wall Street to find much of this material fascinating. And if you are interested in Wall Street - even if you're a regular Joe who's a little intimidated by markets, as I am - the book goes a long way toward helping you tap into the Street savvy you've long suspected was necessary to even the score. A first-rate effort."
2,"Decent read, but not worth $","Explaining how analyists work and their associated confilcts of interest is very interesting stuff. However, this book doesn't really offer advice to investors on how to invest intelligently. In the end, this is a decent book with some good info on how the street works, but its not worth $. I dont plan on re-reading this one in the near future."
1,Don't waste your time,"I really tried to understand the message David was trying to deliver with this book. However, it is so poorly written one must wonder who did the editing. Content wise, it is shallow and offers nothing to anyone seeking an inside look at Wall Street. Faber should stick to offering his opinions on CNBC and forget about a career in writing."
1,Not much of a read,"If you have an ounce of savy about Wall Street you will find this book to be a joke. I think that even if you have never heard of Wall Street you would find this to be a little above kindergarden material. I also think David should stick to giving his opinions on the air and forget about offering them in print. This book just dosen't hold together. He tries to inject a little humor, but that too is weak. If he actually wrote this himself, which I can not entirely believe, then it is pretty poor stuff. Don't look for a follow-up book because this one will not go far. Nice try David, but no cigar."
1,CNBC ... Alert,"Let's face it - business reporters are at the bottom of the investment food chain. Money managers sprinkle them with fish food, and the guppies bite at anything. Want to move a stock? Call a CNBC reporter and wait until they breathlessly deliver their ""breaking"" news. A pattern seems to be emerging with this parade of books from self-important Bubblecasters; they really have no idea how useless they are. So they pose with their Brite-smiles and try to tell you how much they know about investing, even though they are prohibited from buying stocks (I've never done brain surgery, but let me talk you through it). By the way, these reporters are quite self-conscious about other body parts (wink wink nudge nudge). But if you're into pure entertainment, just duck into your local bookstore and do a 4th-grade speed-reading standing up (about 20 minutes)."
1,Horrible,"First off, don't be fooled the book isn't written by ""The Brain"", it's written by Ken Kurson. The book is a nothing book, it contains no actual information but is a mere opportunity for Faber to say he has written a book."
1,Faber is a Joe Kernan want-a-be!,"This book is a joke! It is written for an investor with little or no market knowledge. Faber's background is marginal at best to be writing a book of much indepth material. Second fiddle relief pitcher at Institutional Investor and now sitting in Kernan's shadow has caused Faber to get a little antsy come up with a book to turn the light his way a little. Remember, Sue Herera wrote a book about women on wall street and then Ron Insana came out with his. Both of these were a joke as well with very little insight. But, what do you expect from CNBC reporters? Low IQ's, poor quality of reporting! Just look at CNN!"
4,Fine machine but watch the hype,"If you're looking for a well built, comfortable ""chi"" machine that should last for years, then this is a good one for you to buy.However, don't fall for the hype that this machine can cure ailments, counts as exercise, or even that ""chi"" is involved. The motion of your elevated legs forces blood to your upper back, shoulders, neck and head. After 15 minutes, the machine stops and you feel a rush - it's nice. If you put your legs down immediately, you lose the rush as your bloods returns to the lower sections of the body. You're feeling the blood rush, not ""chi"".Although not as nice as a proper massage, the rush of blood to the upper back/shoulders feels nice and relieves tension - so that may be worth the price alone for some people.As for the machine itself, here are some pros and cons:Pros:-Appears well built-Ankle cradle is very comfortable-Operates quietly-Simple remoteCons:-No adjustable timer-At higher speeds, your legs can fly off the cradle"
2,Vitalizer Rating,"Minimum speed is advertised to be 90 rpm but actual minimum speed is 100+ rpm. Also, the ON/OFF switch is hard to operate."
1,too expensive,Only used a few times. Stomach is supposed to be empty when you use it. Don't feel like using it first in am so it just doesn't get used. Very expensive.
5,Finally!!!,"This set was available about a year ago, but it was pulled from the schedule. Now it is available again. I hope this time it actually gets released and we can then own the complete run of this great family series."
5,Need more tv like the 60s,Daniel Boone was a wholesome family television show with an excellent cast. We could do well to have more shows like that today as nothing on prime time today is appropriate for young children to watch.
1,Why No Season Six?,"Did they lose season six? Why do we get no information as to why they are not being released? Would like to complete my set. Not many clean family shows like this series out.If it has drugs,sex,& disrespectful children it would be complete by now. Please give us some info on when or if they will be released?"
4,DANIEL BOONE SEASON 6,I enjoyed the whole series I was thanksful for the retailer I bought this from. They handled a refund I wanted right away. Joseph Miller
3,Season 6 Where Are You???,"I LOVED seasons 1-5. I watched and re-watch the episodes. They don't make them like that any more. Please, please release season 6. I would like to have a complete set!!"
4,Daniel come here,I have seen season 6 on tv before where is it I would like to complete collection great series please get your act together and bring this series out on dvd
1,Nobody in their right mind will pay the price these merchants are asking!,"Ain't paying this much!! If all DB fans will write the producer of these DVD's to re-issue, maybe they will. I for one, will."
1,"Recipes use unhealthy refined flour, rice and oil","The written material encourages use of whole foods, including whole grains. However, many of the recipes use all purpose flour, sugar, and white rice. I expected to find recipes that used whole grain flours, whole grains, and honey rather than sugar.I also expected recipes that ensured balanced portions of omega 3 fatty acids vs omega 6 fatty acids. There was no mention of the difference between farm raised and wild fish or between grain and grass finished beef.A significant number of the recipes leave much to be desired for the healthy eater. If you are looking for a healthy cookbook, this is not a good choice."
5,Pro Chef Tech Book,A great resource for the working home chef . . wanting to learn more. Extensive amount of infomration.
3,Miss,Nice but not all the recipes work you have to know what to change or add to make them good. Most of the reviews are pretty good though
5,It's not a guide for casual cooks,"Americans are seeking ways to avoid weight gain but want tasty food in the process, so successful chefs and foodservice pros need to adjust their techniques and methods to reflect this revised approach, and the newly updated guide to healthy cooking TECHNIQUES OF HEALTHY COOKING is one place to start. The latest information on ingredients, menu planning and more reviews all the basics, current dietary guidelines, recommendations, and more, teaching both the basics of healthy cooking and reflecting the latest research findings. It's not a guide for casual cooks, but for the college-level foodservice pro who will find over 150 food photos and step-by-step techniques discussions to be invaluable keys to healthy cooking from scratch."
2,"Looks great, but not amazing","The recipes are OK, they favor alot of low-fat substitutions, which I do not care for. So I had to change alot of the recipes.However, the sections where it teaches on techniques, utensils, etc is great if you are a beginner learning about cooking. But I wouldn't rely on this book to prepare tasty meals, but it will give you alot of ideas for good recipes, but you'll have to adjust their recipes."
4,Great book for kids,"My daughter is ADHD and really struggles with reading. She is finally starting to read more, and this is the one book that she truly enjoys. We started with the 2005 version and she read it so much that I bought the 2006 version. This book is much different than the Guiness Book I grew up with - the pages are glossy and it is filled with colorful pictures of world records that children would find interesting."
2,Expected more spirited performance,"The songs are all here but the excitement you expect from an energetic big band is not here.Two stars, instead of one, are awarded only because the music was recorded with modern equipment.The performances were a big disappointment. It's like listening to background music from one of those mini-series produced by ABC television back in the 1970s. You're left thinking the horns are being played by people in their 60s, who lack the lung power to still swing."
3,This movie was not that memorable.,"I was glad I watch it, but probably won't watch it again. I wish there had been a clip of it online."
5,From Back Cover,"Ex-Spy Jacob Keane is pulled away from his boyfriend and daughter and back into the high-stakes world of international espionage when his former partner Marta (Shannen Doherty) reappears after 17 years. With her memory erased, they now must elude a pair of ruthless assassins and a mysterious villain looking to gain classified information at any cost. What ensues is a fast paced game of cat and mouse as Keane must determine who wants them dead, and why."
4,Dark spy drama,"This film I found surprisingly dark in tone - and all the better for it. The opening sequence sets up the John Le Carre type approach to the story, and then we get the usual flashbacks, different locations, etc. that a spy story should have. The acting was fine, the bath-house scene just about appropriate, and it's one that I have kept to see again."
1,What a silly waste of time!,"The audience for Shaun the Sheep was clearly meant for children, but I thought the story lines were puerile, and I was embarrassed to give it as a gift to my young granddaughters."
2,"Phone looks great, but terrible built in Navigation","The phone looks great, but the navigation was so terrible with managing all my 350 contacts that I had to move on to aSony Ericsson Z525a Phone (Cingular)which has excellent navigation along with almost all of Sony Ericsson's phones. If you only have a small selection of contacts in your phone, the navigation problems of this phone won't bother you... Also keep in mind that some cell phone providers may install their own navigation like Verizon."
4,Superb Christmas CD,Mahalia's voice is beautiful and the whole CD has expertly showcased her unique vocal style. I absolutely love this CD and will readily recommend it to all her fans.
5,The best christmas-commpilation on Mahalia Jackson's columbia takes,"A rare found 'Mary' Boy Child Jesus Christ' can be heard on this commpilation, long out of print and only available as a 45 rmp thirty years ago.The other titles are a good mix of the 3 Christmas LPs Mahalia had brought out with Columbia Records."
5,Wonderful CD!,Just great! Very pleased.....she is the best! I recommend this CD to anyone seeking a good Christmas disk or just some nice songs to listen to throughout the year. I think Mahalia Jackson is arguably the greatest gospel/inspirational singer that has ever lived.
3,grew up with Jackson's O Holy Night as a Christmas staple,"Her O Holy Night is one of the best I've heard. But I bought the entire album and honestly I had trouble with most of her other renditions of American favorite Christmas Chorals. Some she and the band just didn't seem to get the right tempo. I found myself thinking come on Mahalia . . . speed it up . . . come on. . . get it going. But throughout the entire song she didn't. Same slow awkward tempo. And maybe the digital enhancement made it audible but sometimes Mahalia appeared to have an African American accent or lisp or something that sounded a little odd and distracted me from the song. ANyway, if anything, download O Holy Night. She does it the best I've heard."
3,Pretty good except....,"OK, well Christopher Pike and L.J. Smith have always been my favorite authors but I think that this peticular book lacks action. It's kind of similar to Remember Me. It's full of information that keeps you going just cuz you want to get over with it and read the spectacular ending (happens in the 3rd book) I wouldn't really say it was suspensful... I've read almost all of his books except for the kiddy ones :) and so I thought it was kinda predictable. I wasn't surprised at all.. It was expected. I think he gave away way too much info. It made it too easy to predicte (in my opinion) No offense Mr. Pike... ;)"
2,A tad better than the last but still ehhh...,"After reading the first one I was hoping that ""The Dance"" would pick up with a bit more mystery, action, plot... Anything at all! This series goes absolutely no where until the last 20 pages of each book! The rest is worthless and boring filler that is completely irrelevant to the story line!Granted this one was a bit better than the last but all the deaths could have been accidents, or suicide, or old age! Nothing has been proven that a murderer even exists and being about 450 pages invested into this series a little action or plot development would be niceI suppose I'll skim through the final book to appease a mild curiosity to who the murderer, if one indeed exists, is! My advice would be to skip this series completely! Pike has some brilliant books in publication such as The Last Vampire, See You Later, Monster, Master of Murder, Whisper Of Death, Bury Me Deep, and Remember Me! Try one of those instead! They are truly brilliant!"
4,Chester A. Arthur,"I found this book to be very enlightening. I never knew much about this president, and the book went into a good amount of detail without going overboard.I have purchased several of the books of the Presidents, and found this to be very interesting, and very readable."
1,Not worth the time,"I took a chance on this one and I lost. I should of looked into this more I thought this was a documentary. Instead its some lunatic that claims to be 80,000 years old and has alien artifacts from a flee-market in Ohio...."
2,TIME,"Amazon needs to put the length of the songs on the site.I just received t-connection(cd) it was the 5 min. version i wanted the 9:42 min. version.How can we the consumer find out how long a song is??? I cannot afford to purchase nor do i need 2 or 3 cd's from the same group while looking for the right song (length).I still want the 9 min. version. The song is ""At Midnight""..."
2,disappointed,"I've done this as it is instructed and not only do I find that it made me sick to even take the pills since they are so huge and smell gross, they also didn't do anything for me, either. I'm the same weight.. Oh well, that just goes to show you that you need to diet and exercise and not take pills to lose weight. :-)"
3,Kept feeling something was missing.,"Even though the book started out fresh and interesting it soon developed into too much and not enough. Too much going on and not enough resolution.A group of 15 high schoolers are asked to pledge the Warriors of Distinction. The club has been thought of as a do good character building club for 50 years but something has gone terribly wrong. Bad choices are made and the initiation activities turn quickly into cruel hazing without any supervision.Some of the characters are poorly developed, left you feeling like something was missing. Author just happens to throw in a boy in a wheelchair and a girl who tricks her way into the pledging. Very little emphasis on the consequences of Jericho choosing the Warriors of Distinction over the chances of a scholarship to Juliard.I wasn't impressed that high schoolers would think the characters or the plot were authentic."
5,The Battle of Jericho,"The Battle of Jericho is a very terrific story.The Battle of Jericho is bout 3 friends who got invited to join the club.They were forced to do stupid things, that was hazing, that was illegal but the pledge masters made them do it any way. They had a meeting everyday after school around 7 or 7:30. At every meeting after school during pledge week they did something different.They had to run around the warehouse were they meet or about 15-20 minutes,they had to dig around in dumpsters,they had to crawl around on the floor like dogs with collors tied around their necks and in the mud,and on the last day of pledge week they had to do something called the leap of faith, but something went wrong while they were doing the leap of faith.I encourage everyone to read this book to find out what happend during the leap of faith.It tell some of the things that kids do to get in clubs and to gain all the attention of students and their class mates.Read The Battle Of Jericho."
3,Unrealistic but Okay,"This book was, I have to admit, thought-provoking and interesting. But, very very unrealistic. I don't know about you, but I've never heard of kids who are so obsessed with wanting to be ""warriors"". Most teens today aren't going to put their head in a toilet or suck a big toe or jump out of a window just to be in some warrior club. Yes, some teens will go through agony to be accepted, but when it comes to nasty stuff like that, most automatically say no. Also, the dialogue seemed fake to me for some reason. Teens don't really use such corny language. This book was pretty interesting, but the whole warriors of distinction thing kinda threw me off. Basically, the theme is: Wow, some kids can be real desperate!!"
4,It is so sad,When they did the leap of faith as soon as I know something was wrong I started to cry like I have go stop reading and clean myself up.I also fell for Jericho because he lost a lot of loved ones in one day his cousin his girl friend and his other friend broke his arm
5,Great Movie,Thumbs up. Recommend this movie for adult viewing only. This is not a kid friendly movie. Need to watch it more than once
1,Got a Generic Battery not an original,I was supposed to get an original one and got a cheap generic battery. Very disappointed....
4,Good as a quickie,"I am an evangelical Christian who wanted a better understanding of Islam, not from a ""how to witness"" viewpoint, but from a ""just the facts, ma'am."" This book did that. It felt as though it was writen from a balanced perspective. The author often pointed out where Islamic beliefs and academic understanding of the Qur'an differ. These tended to be critical of traditional Islamic beliefs. The truth is, academic understanding of the Christian and Hebrew Bible is also often at odds with traditional beliefs. I don't put much faith in the academics, but do try to understand what they are presenting. Those parts I would read with a grain of salt.The chapters are on Islam, Muhammad, Quran, Muslims, Women, Jihad and Terrorism, and Palestine. Interesting and I got a good overview. For it's price is a good beginner's primer."
2,Very Moody Blues.....,"I'll just keep this short. The Moody Blues were great once, they are now well past it."
2,More rehearsal,I always liked The Moody Blues but I think they needed more time playing together before performing live Very disappointing
4,"Great, but not perfect","Its great to be able to watch the Moody Blues live and this DVD is amazing. The sound and graphic quality is superb. If you are a fan, go buy it!2 things wrong that keeps this from getting 5 stars: 1) Its not a full concert, with a few notable songs cut out. 2) An unforgiveable edit of ""Legend of the Mind"" in which over a minute of music is cut out. Have no idea why they did that!"
4,I was impressed ! !,"The picture and content were excellent. I found the DTS sound terrific, too, using a JVC DVD player and receiver. Based mostly on the other reviews, I haven't listened to the dolby version."
5,A smile on your face,"This concert brought a big smile to my face! The sound is great--my surround sound system has never sounded better. The concert is in 5.0 not 5.1. It made no difference. If you ever owned a Moody Blues' CD at anytime,you will love this DVD!"
5,Home Concert thrills,"I have been a fan of the Moody Blues for a long time. Having gone to my first concert by them recently, this was a real treat,but my only objection is that they cut the number of songs that they played at the concert. Superb sound in DTS puts you right there in front of the band. The sound is excellent and the great camera shots make this my favorite dvd. It was my first dvd and it set the standard of all the others to match. If you aren't a big fan of The Moodys, you will still like how it looks and sounds on your system. I strongly suggest you buy it if it is only to showoff your system."
2,Don't Miss Highway Girl,"I Love the Early Hip. Don't know what happened to them from Day From Night Onward, but love their early stuff. Trying to find this CD is impossible. It is supposed to be coming out in the HyperCd Format this fall(isn't that now?) with an additional song.My Greatest Hits of Hip will not be complete until I get Highway Girl..."
5,"same song, same chords, same beat, same sound, over and over","same song, same chords, same beat, same sound, over and over same song, same chords, same beat, same sound, over and over same song, same chords, same beat, same sound, over and over"
3,"Good, but not great","This book has a very good overview of 1000 idioms alphabetized by Pinyin. It has the 4 chineses characters for each idiom followed by the Pinyin, a literal translation as well as an explanation of what it is trying to say. One major complaint and one small one. Major: There are no tone marks on the pinyin! If you want to use a saying you need a dictionary to get the tones. Minor: the font chosen for the characters simulates natural handwriting and is difficult for a beginer to read. If they rereleased the book with these changes it would be a 4 stars."
4,"comprehensive, but not great","I agree with the previous reviewer - if this book had tone marks with the PinYin, it would rate a full star higher! The Chinese is a little difficult to read (I'm just starting out learning Chinese) due to the typesetting fint used. I like the organization - based upon the first Chinese character in the phrase - you can find related phrases together.I have no trouble recemmending this book, but could be much more enthusiastic if there were a couple printing changes made."
4,what a mess,Popcorn has good flavor. when my package arrived 2 of the packages had leaked out the liquid butter flavoring all over the other packages.
2,Wasteful and too Salty,"There is a LOT of waste of popcorn because so many kernels do not pop. Most of this is because when the popped corn starts to come out a lot of unpopped corn comes out with it. Reviewers are right, way too salty if you use all the salt. I have a 4oz popper so not much room. I cut the packets apart and empty them separately, throwing away most of the salt. Be careful if you do this. I ended up spilling corn onto the floor the 1st couple of times because I cut the oil packet way too close to the corn. Popcorn isn't bad tasting but can be a little chewy. Smell of it popping is great."
3,Not the freshest corn,"The packaging design and quality is excellent. But I am not very happy with some of the popcorn. Some packets taste great, and others taste old or stale."
3,Case (24) of 6 Ounce Great Northern Popcorn Portion,GREAT POPCORN COOKS GOOD TO BUT FOR ME ITS TO SALTY
3,Disclaimer,I have just ordered this same product from Great Northern Popcorn website. It is about $30.00 cheaper than Amazon. Have not tried it yet so I don't know how it taste.
3,tastes ok packaging a pain,having salt in separate area is a pain it makes it hard to regulate the salt that you are putting in so if you like salt go ahead get this product.
1,Not tender,"We were very disappointed in this product. I had read the reviews and was expecting a delicious, theater quality popcorn. I popped it according to directions in our stove top Whirley Pop. The popcorn was not tender at all, tasted old and chewy, with a lot of the hard hull remaining on the popped product. The popcorn also had a very strange heavy after taste and an odd smell. Another reviewer mentioned a slight coconut oil after taste, this was not slight but very pronounced. Our kids, who can each eat a bag of popped corn a piece during a movie--even if it's scorched, didn't like it at all. We each took a couple of bites and threw the entire bowl out. It was awful! If I can, I will return it and ask for a refund....if I can't, I will toss it out. I won't even donate it to the food bank...it was that bad."
4,Delish!,"Sooo convenient! And really tastes like movie theater popcorn! ,y only reason for giving 4 stars is that some of the popped kernels taste sweet...more like kettle corn. But...everyone else in my household (1 adult, 5 kids) loves this stuff!!!"
3,Too many kernels,"I bought the GN popcorn popper and the GN portion packs. The popcorn looks, smells and tastes great!!! But, there was way too much unpopped corn. We had an event at the studio and I went through all 24 of the 8oz. packages I bought. The unpopped kernels equaled over 8 cups!!"
5,the best popcorn in the usa,like is says that this is the best popcorn in the u.s.Eight Ounce Portion Packs (Case of 24)a it really is .the popcorn is the best because of the butter and there is no trans fat and no cholesterol. it is truely the best popcorn in the u.s.a or possible the best in the world.
5,Good Stuff,This is great popcorn at a great price. I learned a lesson as well - don't buy the 8oz bags if you have a stove top hand crank popper - buy the 4oz. It's not easy splitting the 8 oz contents in 2.
2,Going to try and give this away to some starving college kids,"The oil is SOLID and hard in the package. Just looking at it made my 50 year old heart slow down. Plus, we did not hear a choir of angels singing the Halleluja Chorus when we ate it; it was mediocre popcorn with many unpopped kernels. My own fault - I should have known that, like sausage, its better not to know how ""movie theater"" popcorn is made (hint: yellow food dye is essential). We cannot bring ourselves to eat this again."
4,Perfect Popcorn and Allows Adjustable Salt Content,"These packs guarantee that each batch you pop is fresh (obviosuly much fresher than even theater popcorn), and of course it tastes great! This is a perfect pack for 8oz poppers, everything is pre-measured. My wife really likes that fact that the the corn, oil and salt are all partitioned separately on these packs. That way we can control exactly how much salt goes into the batch for popping. Reducing the amount of salt by half still gives us great tasting popcorn. I can vary the amount of salt in each batch based upon the preference of the people that will be eating the popcorn. Everyone is happy this way. Try doing that at a theater concession stand!"
2,Popcorn...AAACCCHHH!,"My sister told me about this popcorn, saying it is the best she ever had. Wow, I must have gotten a bad batch. Mine is very dry, crumbly and hully. The kernals fall to pieces and have so many pieces in hull in them, they are impossible to eat. Will Not purchase again!"
1,Old and salty!,"Popcorn tastes old, and if you use the entire salt contents your popcorn is horribly salty. I thought it was just me but everyone who has tried it thought the same."
3,It's Average,"I'm disappointed in this popcorn. After reading the reviews, I thought it would be fantastic. I made it in my Whirley Popper. It doesn't even come close to movie popcorn. People complained that it was too salty. Not my batch. And, no buttery taste. Bummer......"
3,"All-N-One, Not bad",We purchased a large table top popcorn machine with an 8oz. kettle. It is a little difficult to squeeze the oil portion into the large kettle. The flavor of the popcorn is quite good. The packages are easy to store. Overall my rating was 3 stars because of the difficulty with the solidified oil. We have a family of 5 and use 2 packages to satisfy all of us. One package can easily feed 3-4 people.
4,Too Salty,"Way too much salt in this pack. Don't get me wrong, I like me some salty popcorn, but this is over the top. However, you can solve the issue by cutting a hole in the bottom of the popcorn side and pour 3/4 of the salt out. Once we discovered this trick, great tasting popcorn was the result."
3,"Convenient, but lacking in taste","I give it 3 stars for the convenience of having everything proportioned in a single packet, but I didn't care for the flavor of this popcorn. It did not have a buttery taste and was overly salty. Will keep looking..."
4,popcorn lover,"The 2.5 oz. size bags of Great Northern Popcorn comes with oil on one side of bag and the popcorn and salt on the other side. This way you can add the oil to the popper and warm it up ( usually takes around 3 minutes.) Add the popcorn and salt and in just a few minutes you are ready to enjoy. Now I did found some old maids, but i had tried other popcorns and also found it true with these too. This has a good taste and just the right amount of salt. I feel that this is a good buy for the money. This work good with the use of the 2.5 oz table top retro style popcorn popper."
5,"Delicious,absooooooo-lutely the best popcorn ever!!!!!","This popcorn is amazing, especially with Discount Tommy's popcorn poppers. The popcorn pops evenly and tastes absolutely marvelous. Can't go wrong with this popcorn. Best of all I have used. I even gave some away to relatives for Christmas it is so delicious."
5,Just like at the movies!,Taste as good as the kind you would purchase at the theater :) would definitely purchase again! Great popcorn!!! Don't even need to add salt since it is presalted!
3,Popcorn,The packaging is very convenient for the small 2.5 ounce popcorn poppers. The taste rivals movie theaters. The only negative is this is too salty. I do not know if it has to do with popcorn popper (it seems to have a large number of un-popped kernels)or just too much salt. We compensate by adding 50% more popcorn to the popper and this produces a much better product.
1,"Very, I mean VERY Disappointed","Don't ... Do not ... Don't even think about buying this popcorn if you prefer hull-less, fluffy, delicious, theater-type popcorn. If, however, you prefer small, tough, ugly looking little pea-sized round things that taste horrible, go ahead and waste your money."
5,A+,Works great with my Great Northern Roosevelt popcorn machine. It's more expensive than buying individual ingredients but the extra cost is very little considering what I paid for the popcorn machine.
5,Real Deal Theater style... as easy as microwave popcorn,"Using this popcorn in my new popcorn machine that I ordered for the office... coworkers love it. Comes in premeasured bags with the REAL DEAL theater ingredients like coconut oil and butter flavored salt. Just cut it open and pour it in - probably works best with a theater style popcorn maker - plent of those available for less than $150. If you have a home theater, get a popcorn maker (i have the paramount 8oz - works perfect), then get this popcorn. I will be ordering again. I accidentally bought the 4oz instead of 8oz, but i just use two packets. 8oz is a better deal it seems for about $7 more."
5,Awesome deal!,I have a 2oz. popper and these 2.5 oz packets work perfectly! The flavor is fantastic and it is a great value. I use the auto-refill program and save even more money!
1,OLD POPCORN,"I recently purchased this popcorn and less than half of the popcorn popped. And those that did pop were tough. I believe these were old. I've purchased other brands and they all have an expiration date printed on back each pack. These had no expiration dates printed, therefore there was no way of knowing how old these were or how long they have been in their stock. I popped the jolly time brand and it popped perfectly. I also find that this is on the list of things that can't be returned per Amazon.com policy. I'm going to purchase the Jolly time popcorn at Smart & Finals. Cheaper and there fresh!!! What a rip off!!!"
5,Always a favorite,"I always buy this popcorn for my dad who has a neighborhood group, and often sponsors boxing matches and other get togethers. He has a 6 ounce popper and he swears by this popcorn, "" so easy"" he says, and the people love it. So if you have a 6 ounce popper, GET THIS POPCORN!!!!"
2,Poor Quality,I believe that this product is old/expired or being stored incorrectly. Only about half the kernels popped and the kernels that did pop had an odd chewy/stale texture to them. I would not recommend buying from this company.
3,Not as good as everyone said?!?,"We have a Great Northern machine, experimented with several different approaches to popping (pouring pkts in all at once, one portion at time, heating pot first etc). We've watched all the video tutorials...We found it produces A LOT of old maids & chewy small popcorn?! I'm so disappointed because we bought a large case! However, with that said it does produce some yummy popcorn as well. So I'm not sure if the case we received was old & since it does produce a lot of popcorn - we just weed through it for the good stuff?!"
2,Poor Popping Corn,"This popcorn package is a great idea. It has MANY flaws. It is very difficult to pour the oil into the popcorn popper. It is best when you heat the oil for 3-5 minutes and then add the popcorn and seasoning., The popcorn does not pop completely. There are lots of left over kernels that never pop. I am very disappointed in this product. I will not purchase this product again."
1,BAD,"First off , It leave a bad taste in our mouth. Next Dose not taste like any thing I ever had .and last it made us sick later that night .there's no use by date on it so it makes one wounder if it is out dated"
4,Easy to use - could use better labeling,"These packets are easy to use. Loved that. Used them at a fundraising event. However, I had no way to gauge how many servings each packet makes. I would have appreciated some information about that on the Amazon page and on the packets themselves. I ordered 4 boxes and am stuck with 3.5 boxes that cannot be returned."
5,Popcorn better than oil popped or microwave.,"This is now our favorite popcorn. We have long since stopped using microwave popcorn because it was either too greasy or chewy. So, we went back to popping kernels in oil on the stove until we bought a popcorn machine. Now, we gave away our other popcorn and all we use is the Great Northern Popcorn portion packs. The popcorn comes out perfect everytime with great taste. It is salted just right, very light, and not greasy. Highly recommend this product."
5,Great popcorn,"I purchased this popcorn for my roosevelt popper purchased thru tommy's.The packets are so easy to use since there is no measuring.This is by far the best popcorn i have used so far taste as good as movie theatre popcorn,my kids love it as well as my wife.Its a wonderful treat for movie nights."
5,Awesome theatre style popcorn!!,I bought the pit popper and the popcorn and it is absolutely delicious. The popcorn tastes like theatre popcorn. Huge hit at the campground!!! I would certainly recommend to everyone. The pit popper is well worth the money too.
5,The best Flavor!!!!!!!!!,"You will only need a great movie, because this popcorn It's like bringing the movie theater to your house!!! Excellent!!!!!!!!"
4,"Great, but portioning is BAD...","This will get you very, very close to that movie-theater/carnival popcorn taste, BUT, not as dispensed in these pack. They heed more oil for flavoring. As these packs come, they will pop very well and be more healthy, but the finished product will have much less flavor. I had to use two packets worth of oil, and one packet's worth of salt and popcorn for it to taste like that great movie theater popcorn. this wastes a lot of corn, and so I will no longer order this portion packs; will instead order all the components separately so that I can make it just right (with more oil) without wasting anything..."
1,Stale,"Absolutely the worst tasting popcorn I have ever made. Very stale corn, tougher than leather. DO NOT buy this product, hopefully I can return this terrible product"
3,"Not as good as theater by a long shot, but still ok","The main problem is that it is overly salty... so those who are saying that, I totally agree. I wish they would give a packet that was half the salt of what they put into these... and I like salt... its just too much for a proper popcorn balance..."
4,"VERY GOOD, BUT VERY SALTY","I really like this brand of popcorn. I have a really small popper and the smallest pack works perfect for it. The popcorn is VERY salty though, so I just snip the corner of the package and dump out about half of the salt. Other than that I think it tastes just like the theater!"
2,Tough popcorn,We tried this brand based on decent reviews & price but were unhappy with the texture; the popcorn is very tough. I will likely donate or toss.
1,quite possibly the worst popcorn ever,i am greatly regretting buying an entire case of this popcorn - it may be the worst popcorn i have ever eaten. i would return if i could... now to find someone to pawn it off on. buyer beware!
1,too salty,"The salt is included with the oil for this popcorn and it is extremely salty. I have a high salt tolerance so unless you like salt more than popcorn, beware."
2,"High Calories, Fat but Less Good Taste","This popcorn is distinctly different tasting from the Country Time, and not in a good way! My initial thought was that it was ""stale"" though in date, and both of us (hubby and self) got an upset stomach from eating it, like you do at the movies if you add their ""butter"". I would return this if I could I've had it since July, and just opened the pack last night) and would not recommend it, at least not for the big home popcorn machines. AND, has a higher calorie count and fat count than the Countrytime, too! (Sort of explains the upset stomach, I guess!)"
1,Terrible,"I don't know why they're so many good reviews, but this popcorn is terrible!! Nothing like the movie theatres popcorn...save your money and stick with microwable bags!!"
5,Excellent Popcorn.,Super easy to use and makes just the right amount of popcorn for two of us. Price is right and delivery was fast. (Got here before the popcorn machine....;o)
5,"Excellent, but...","Just got a popper and bought some of this as well as some West Bend popcorn (which I tried with the Lou-Ana popcorn oil bars). I very much prefer these. More of the kernels popped, they were far fluffier, and the popcorn simply tasted better (this is after salting the West Bend with Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt). The packs make it very simple. Cut the top, dump in the kettle, hit the heater, wait for the sound of the sizzle, and go! My only concern is that you have to take a bit of care not to drop oil all over the place. If you cut the top off, then carefully 'roll' the pack, it makes it much easier to drop it all in, then squeeze the oil out."
4,Movie need popcorn,Good for my need plus it's says me the guess work. Taste good too!! it came to my door so fast it made me have movie night in the middle of the week
4,Yummy But Salty!,After reading many reviews I decided to give it a try....This popcorn is very yummy and I'm glad I bought it however it is a bit salty which bothered my lips and made me thirsty. It did taste and smell like the movies though. Overall we enjoyed it and all the kernals popped.
4,Great Concept,"The concept of the ""Portion Pack"" is great. Great Northern has great Popcorn!! really the only issue I had was the sheer amount of salt!!! Yes, I took into consideration my normal No Salt lifestyle and leaned to the salt Connoisseur's taste, Yet even still!! Wow!! too much salt!!Hey Great Northern!! Can you make a Low Sodium Portion Pack???? Please!!!"
5,Great northern popcorn,"I love this popcorn, Tastes just like movie house popcorn and so easy. just empty the packets into a pan , I use Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper, and it comes out perfect."
4,little bambinos,Tried the popcorn on my little bambino popper machine . I am very happy with the results . most of it pops the flavor taste is excellent will recommend it .
3,Great for the price,"I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of ""Old Maid"" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $."
1,Mouth burning,"The popcorn pops great but after eating a few mouth fulls, my mouth started burning. It far too salty. My wife refuses to eat it. I will not recommend."
5,Good and Easy! What else could you want?,"I have a Waring WPM35 which is a 10 cup popper. I use these Great Northern 8 oz. portion packs. I also use the 2 oz. popcorn bags which have a 5"" in diameter opening size and they are just right to stuff your hand easily into them to get that last kernel. This product is easy because everything you need is in one pack, easily opened and dumped into the kettle. Tastes like movie theater popcorn too. I'll give it a 5."
2,Un-Pop-Corn,"I ordered a case of this popcorn using the automatic re-order system. After reading some of the reviews about the quality of the popcorn, I chose to give it a chance, price being one of my primary reasons for ordering and the automatic re-order feature. Well, as they say, you get what you pay for. Only about 2/3 of the kernels pop and of the ones that do, the popped corn is very small in size. The product tastes really good, what you're able to get from the package. By the time you figure the amount of unpopped kernels, you would be much better off spending a little more money for a premium product."
4,Great Northern PopCorn,"The popcorn is good but if you want outstanding continue looking. It isn't overly buttery and if your wondering 1- 8oz bag makes 7- 1 1/2 oz bags.My kids who are popcorn addicts like it. It works if your looking to sell it, I tried Gold Medal popcorn that was really good!!"
4,Very good popcorn,"My family loves popcorn; the portioned packages work well. the only suggestion that I would have is to cut the popcorn and seasoning part out first, place them in a measuring cup. this will make it easier to pour in the pan for popping. I spilled a significant amount of the seasoning and popcorn at first; and the fact that it's stored in plastic makes it not such a wise decision to place the plastic next to the hot pan. of course put the butter in first, then add the popcorn and seasoning; less mess.just about every kernel pops. very tasty!!!"
4,"tastes like movie theater popcorn, just a bit too salty",Overall great product. I tend to only pour in half the salt though because using the full pouch makes the popcorn extremely salty.
3,Great Northern popcorn,"The product was food , left many unpopped kernels and the amount of salt is a little much for my taste."
3,Good product except,"This is a pretty good product in the fact that everything is pre mesured for you. Just cut the top and pour it in. The only problem for me was there was waaaay to much salt. And since it is already in the product the heat makes it stick to the popcorn so each piece has a lot of salt. You almost need to drink a lot of water during and after you eat this. If it had about 1/2 as much salt it would get a 5 from me, but as it is now I have to work to take the salt out when takes the ease of jsut cut and pour out of the product. But if you like salt, its perfect for you, the best example I can think of, is that it does taste like and smell like movie popcorn, but purchase a movie popcorn and then pour about another 3 tablespoons of salt on it."
3,"Good movie style popcorn, a bit salty",These packets are easy to use. Not the most healthy thing in the world. Very salty. Sometimes too salty for my taste.
5,I keep coming back for more...,"We purchased our machine from Great Northern Popcorn 18 months ago, and have managed to consume several cases of this product for use in the machine. Completely satisfied, as the consistency provides the same great product time after time. Have recommended to our friends, who love not only the taste, but the machine. Could not ask for a better product."
5,Great Tasting Popcorn,"This popcorn not only tastes great but pops very well. There are some unpopped kernels, but I believe that's normal with any brand. In reading a few of the other reviews, some noted it didn't pop well. I went through that phase too but found out it was a problem with my popper. Once that was fixed, the popcorn popped up a storm! Many friends who have visited my home theater have commented on what good flavor the Great Northern Popcorn has--and it has a great price too. Highly recommended."
5,Great Taste,"This Popcorn rivals that of movie theaters! Even the so call people selling ""movie theater popcorn"" cannot hold a candle to this popcorn."
4,Northern Popcorn,We found the popcorn a little salty for our taste so next time we will not add the packet of salt enclosed to see it it is more to our liking.
3,Easy to use,this pops up well and has a good flavor the packaging makes it easy to use as well but does not tast the same as the movies
3,A little sweet,Pops well. A little too sweet with the coconut oil for my taste. This no fault on the product. I performed as advertised. It just wasn't my taste.
5,PERFECT PORTIONS,THE PACKAGING IS GREAT AND IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR THE POPPER WE GOT. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE CONTENTS TO POUR INTO THE KETTLE PROPERLY WITHOUT MAKING A MESS. HAVE TO PUT IN A SEPERATE CONTAINER WITH A SPOUT. THE FLAVOR IS GREAT!!
5,Neighborhood kids keep coming back for more,"Our guests love this popcorn! The premeasured portions make it so easy to use, and while it's not perfectly easy to add the ingredients, for us it's more about the location of the kettle in our theatre style machine than the packaging.Easy enough for my kids to make (teens, as I would worry about younger kids getting burnt on the kettle).For those who think it's too salty, that is easy enough to remedy, don't use all the salt! Salty is a matter of taste, and some people might think the saltiness is just right with the amount they put in each package. So, isn't the amount of salt they provide just right? If they used less, there would be people complaining that there isn't enough salt.We think it's great!!"
4,Average Popcorn - Nice size bags,Average tasting machine popcorn - not too bad...wish that it taste more buttery - but not too bad for the price...Worth buying.
2,"Love the taste, not happy with popcorn","I have the 8ounce popcorn machine with kettle. I have used 10 packs of the popcorn out of the 24 pack case. The taste of the popcorn is great, but at least 25% of the popcorn does not pop. The kernel cather is half full of unpopped kernels after each batch. I will try other brands because to Me that is just too much unpopped kernels."
1,Both EXPIRED,"Do NOT buy this product from Amazon. I ordered one box, opened in to find that the ""oil"" was hard as a rock. Had another replacement send and this ""oil"" was also hard as a rock and it was turning white. Amazon does not check these items whatsoever. They sit in the warehouse for years and they don't open the boxes before shipping to make sure the product is good. Very disappointing."
1,"Popcorn Tastes Stale, Dry and Old","We had just received this afternoon and popped one bag to share this eve. We followed directions exactly. You taste the hint of movie theatre popcorn, but this popcorn is not fresh. We were very disappointed and couldn't even eat what we had popped. We have had this type of product by a different name and maker at a friends home, and their product exceeded this one with more freshness and taste in every way. I wanted to return immediately, but Amazon policy for this item wouldn't allow it. The best popcorn is fresh popcorn. All the kernels popped; nothing burned.This is just old stale popcorn. Obviously, I would never buy it again, nor would I ever recommend it!"
1,Only half the corn pops,The flavor of what pops is good but only half the corn pops. I know its not my poper because Started using the oil and salt from these packages and different seeds.
3,Popcorn for Popper,"Popcorn ok, doesn't pop very well. Might be popper no tpopcorn. Wife and kids still love it. Not sorry I purchased. Shipping was quick."
4,"Good, but salty","I use theMaxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite Tabletop Old-Fashioned 4-Ounce Kettle Popcorn Popper Machine. I get just a few unpopped kernels. If you put the whole package into the kettle, the popcorn comes out a little salty. This can be solved by not opening the salt in the package until the corn and oil are placed into kettle. Then opening the salt on the package and only adding as much as you want.Overall, good popcorn. I'm not an expert, but it's great for me and my family."
5,Great Popcorn,I can't believe I could get this much great popcorn (along with the oil and seasoning) for such a low cost! It tastes almost like movie theatre popcorn and doesn't have all the calories!
4,"Good price, Great Popcorn","Not the healthiest thing on the menu but when you want the taste of Movie Theater popcorn there is really no other substitute. The portion, flavor and salt are all perfectly measured so we have never needed to add anything else (except maybe a dash of tobasco or some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.I would highly recommend this product but wished it was a little cheaper (hence 4 instead of 5 stars). I guess you can't have everything."
2,Tasted Great... For About 3 Weeks,"I was a bit dismayed that there wasn't an expiration date on the box or on any of the individual packages. The popcorn tasted great for about 3 weeks and then it just tasted stale. Gross, I had to throw out over half of the product."
1,Avoid this popcorn,After making several batches using different techniques I can only get 50% of the kernels to pop. I used a different brand of kernels with much better results. The only conclusion I can come to is that these packages are stale. It doesn't help that there is no expiration or manufacture date listed anywhere on the packages. I would recommend to not buy this product.
1,Product has changed and now tastes just like microwave popcorn,"I tried this product about 2 years ago and it was just like movie theatre popcorn at that time but since that time, they must have changed the product and now tastes more like a microwave popcorn that lacks flavor. The packaging has changed to include a separate salt/butter flavor compartment and the oil is now a liquid instead of a solid. Very disappointed in this product and sadly I now have 23 packets remaining."
3,"good taste, solidified oil","I was concerned when I received it because of the oil being solidified. I looked for a date on it to see if it was old product, but did not find any dates. I tried one package to see how it tasted. It tasted normal. It was a little more difficult to get out of the package since I had to do just the oil first to let it melt before putting the popcorn and seasoning parts of the package in. It would be nice if the packages were dated so that I know how long I have to use them for best results, and I'm really not sure of how old they are to begin with.So bottom line, I was happy with the taste, but convenience is somewhat diminished because the oil is solid.Added 11/28/11 - I do prefer to use less of the seasoned salt. It's pretty salty for me, so I just don't use it all and it tastes fine still."
5,another great product,I just love the flavor of this product. It pops nearly all the cernals and has very little waste. It is the correct measurement of oil to popcorn and there is no oil left over after all the popcorn pops.T. J. Mulhern
1,Popcorn was hard and stale. Could have been this lot only.,"I tried finding a sell by or expiration date, but couldn't find one on any of the packages. I tried using the lowest temperature I could. I tried allowing the popcorn to release steam when it was done popping and transferred to my popcorn bowl. I've never had to work to help popcorn come out crispy and fluffy. May have been an old and expired lot, but it should have been thrown out and not sold to consumers. Will not take a chance on this product again."
1,"STALE AND CAN'T RETURN BECAUSE OF A ""NO-RETURN"" POLICY","I received this box of popcorn and ""STALE"" is an understatement. The seller has a NON RETURN policy and I can't email them either.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEYRIP OFFPOPCORN IS STALE AND THERE IS A ""NON-RETURN"" POLICY"
2,STALE,"Third time I've bought this brand,,,it is STALE,,not gonna bother to return it,,,no second chances, will find another brand. I'm sure another brand offers the same size. To be clear, the first boxes were fresh. Take your best shot."
4,Good popcorn but lots of unpopped kernels,"The taste and smell of the popcorn is great. typically, a 6 ounce pack might leave 30-40 unpoppped kernels. I don't understand if this is due to the popper or the kernels."
3,"Tasty, but too many unpopped kernels","Not sure if this is the fault of the popcorn, the popcorn popper or the user, but I'm having a problem with unpopped kernels. I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over. So for my family of 5, one 8 oz package isn't really enough, but two is too much."
2,Nothing like real carnival style popcorn,"With all the rave reviews, coupled with the fact that these pre-packs include all the right ingredients, I assumed the result would be at least 75% authentic carnival style popcorn for my popcorn maker. After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing! This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend."
5,O popped corn!,Golden niblets of heavenSaliferous manna from the godsCrackling crispy bitesWho would resist your wispy orbs?Your crags and craggles and wondermentsPerfection yielding only when all are devouredI look upon the unpopped kernels with pityKnowing theirs was a destiny of the damned
1,horrible- stale,Arrived last night. We made one batch that only half of the kernels popped. The popped kernels only half popped so the hard parts darn near broke our teeth. since only part of the packet popped it left the remaining salty & greasy.
5,Great Northern Popcorn is Great!,"We all love it. I have a ""Man Cave"" in my basement with a popcorn machine. All my friends and family love the popcorn I pop. I now use nothing but Great Northern. I also have a small machine in the main area of our house and use nothing but Great Northern in it as well. Great taste, very tasteful seasonings, includes the seasonings and oil. We love it!"
3,"Not Really ""Great"" but It's fun if you like Midler","I just got the DVD and had not seen the movie since it was released several years ago now. Watching it again, I could see that Bette Midler didn't really even try to BE Jackie she just played it as bette midler saying Words that Jackie would (or may have) said in any of the given situations of her life. Now thinking back to what a great performace Midler gave in the ""Rose"" I am not sure what she was thinking here-but I liked it the first time (aka-I am big midler fan) and and I enjoyed it again (Aka-I am Midler fan) not sure if you were not a big midler fan that you would enjoy her playing Jackie but again if you are-it's a fun 90 mintues."
4,Company well worth spending a couple of hours with...,"Loose biopic of the life of Jacqueline Susann, author of ""Valley of the Dolls"". Susann died of cancer in 1974, Good work by Bette Midler in the title role. Nathan Lane, of course, was great as Irving Mansfield, her agent and doting husband. And what an amazing collection of neckties! Nice supporting work by David Hyde Pierce, Stockard Channing and John Cleese. I'm giving this film 4 stars mostly for its design elements, and the fact it was partly shot in Montreal. :) It's a nice little movie."
2,sad!,"I think Leonard Maltin says it best - the film is ""ill conceived"". It's not funny, nor serious or off the wall. It's basically bland and that's amazing given the ensemble of talent in this film. I watched on DVD and the sound and video were excellent - it's sad, I feel the subject of the film has merit, it just never came off with the treatment it was given!"
1,Isn't She Embarrassed!,"As a loyal Midler fan I rented this disapointment of a film. It does not serve as a bioflick or a comedy. I am amazed at the graciousness of the reviews here. Simply put this film is an embarrassment to all involved. There is a terrific cast and an able writer but it all comes to nothing. Bette doesn't seem to know if she's in Big Business or For The Boys! I love Bette but she overacts and it is hard to watch. Every joke falls flat and it's pathetic attempt at sentiment rings false and forced. What were they thinking when they made this film? The critics were right this time around. This deserved to be a bomb in the theaters and yes, in your home."
2,Superficial on superficial,"This is a stunningly superficial film about incredibly superficial people. Bette Midler plays Bette Midler, of course, and Nathan Lane is simply wonderful. But the script stinks. Not more than a single laugh in the movie. But what could be done with a biography of a pornographer who wanted only to be famous and cursed God, whom she thought lived in a tree? Technically, the film is fine. But it isn't worth anyone's time."
2,Shadow of a Doll...,"I've watched the DVD a few times, to see if there was any nuances I had missed from the film...There wasn't. Neither a straight up camp-fest (pardon the oxymoron) or a serious biography, ""Isn't She Great"" lacks focus, unlike the real Jacqueline Susann's desire to be a star. Bette makes a go of it, but she's as miscast as Patty Duke in ""Valley Of The Dolls."" This is made more apparent by Stockard Channing, who does more with her 5 minutes of film, then Bette does with 90! Stockard would have been brilliant as Jacqueline, espescially in physical appearance. While Paul Rudnick was attempting to cover 50+ years in his script, he probably would have had more luck in focusing on the hoopla around Valley of the Dolls. As for the DVD extras, there were several missed opportunities: A bio on the real Jacqueline, behind the scenes, making of stuff. Bette didn't extend herself to promote this film. I can see why."
2,Miscast and Not That Funny,This film should have been a laughfest given Jacqueline Susann's campy lifestyle and wild excess but things just don't go well here. Part of the problem is a story which can't decide whether to be funny or serious. You feel badly for Susann and her husband Irving Mansfield after their son Guy has to be institutionalized but that sympathy evaporates when they visit the hapless child only to perform their schtick in front of him. Bette Midler is padded and overly made-up to look like a fat yenta but she veers toward self-parody. Nathan Lane is way too effete for his role as Irving Mansfield but Stockard Channing (who should have played Susann) and David Hyde Pierce are spot-on.
3,A little too slapstick for me.,"I usually love Bette Midler, but this is so overdone and shmaltzy. She is so much better without a script. I turned it off before it was over."
2,Bette Midler as Jacqueline Susan. Doesn't work too well,"As I heard one critic say, it would've been better if someone such as Stockard Channing who gives a satisfactory supporting performance here would have played the title character. THe movie is first of all too campy for Bette's popularity as well as too serious for her brassy, outlandish which works very rarely in dramas as it did in THE ROSE, BEACHES and FOR THE BOYS (the best dramas of her career). Nathan Lane as the husband? EXCUSE ME. He is a good actor but doesn't work well in this role. The rest of the supporting cast do a good job in the brief appearances they make as Bette and Nathan dominate most of the film. Bette does a good job but someone better could have filled this role. Bette does have a chance to show some of her witty humor but not too often. More entertaining if you are a fan of one of the stars or even better if you're a Jackie fan."
3,Not as good as the first book,"I absolutely loved the first book, but this one didn't do much for me. The magic part was somewhat lacking, the romance was frustrating, and the male protaganist just wasn't as strong personality-wise as I would have liked. The overall story and romance just wasn't magical like I've come to expect from a Susan Krinard novel. I usually re-read her books every couple of years, but this one won't be one of them."
2,buy this one at a used price,"I usually love Susan Krinard, but not this series. If you want to keep up with the characters in this line, get the book at a discount."
2,"Small, Convenient, and Annoying","I like Berlitz' little guides. They are handy enough to put in a pants pocket as I traipse across a land where I'm illiterate and unable to speak good (insert language here). This book, however, was a more pointed example of another Berlitz book trait: Most of the time, the Korean folks I met had a puzzled look on their face, not because of the (horrible) accent, but because of the archaic and stilted Korean this book translated my phrases into. One new friend borrowed it for a few minutes and couldn't stop laughing.These books are useful but for this particular one I'd be forewarned."
1,Don't Buy This,"The music and singing are beautiful (it's Purcell after all) but the production is a freak show, full of repulsive characters, ugly (as opposed to graceful) modern dancing and lots of silly and meaningless stage business. There is no attempt to recreate the beauty of the masques or relate the action to the musical themes. It is modern updating at its worst! See Minkowski's Platee for a successful update of a Rameau classic. If you like Purcell, get the CD and avoid this nightmare."
2,Fairies and Queens,"I've only listened to excerpts from 'The Fairy Queen' before this so I don't know its original form. I've always understood it to be a masque in which spoken word and music were combined much like German singspiel. This performance is through-sung in the usual operatic manner alternating aria with recitative. I have no objection to this or to the musical performance. The visual part however is a disaster. Whoever was responsible for it took a lame and obvious turn on the word 'fairy' and presented the fairies as the more flamboyant elements of the gay and lesbian sub-culture. The mortals, again obviously, are corporate types in gray suits except for a drunken poet. I suppose there was a plot to follow, but it was too obscure to bother with. The performance is messy, the costumes are messy, and the sets are messy, and they all have little relation to the music's Baroque formality."
1,A nightmare at the opera,"This is a nightmarish production that bears little resemblance to Purcell's story and is not remotely connected to his stunningly beautiful music. There are drag queens, gay couples, a ""drunk"" singer, bad taste throughout - you name it. It is not uplifting and inspiring, but depressing and degrading.It is so bad and absurd that I was surprised Peter Sellar's name is not in the credits.Avoid like the plague. Get a CD instead, close your eyes and enjoy Purcell's extraordinarily inspired music. You've been warned."
2,NOT one of Purcell's bests,"When I bought this film I hoped thet it would be a tipical Purcell's film. To my dissapointment it wasn't. For worst its quite bad. But at least it has some very nice scenes, where you can admire all the glory of such a wonderful country."
3,"Great Cables, Misleading Photo","While these cables are truly excellent and a great deal, buyer beware that what you see in the picture is not what you get. I know that it doesn't state in the description or anywhere for that matter that this item includes audio cables, but the picture implies otherwise showing the 3 component connectors with the 2 audio connectors. Just a word of caution, read the description carefully!"
2,Monster ULT V800 CV-4 Ultra 800 Component Video Cables (4 feet),"The cables have excellent build-quality and appear to provide superior quality of performance in the few days I have used it so far. This to me is in line with the reputation of Monster I have heard so far. However, the connector end that fits over the jack to lock the cables were extremely tight. It took a lot of strenous effort of push them onto my BluRay player output jacks and my AV reciever inputs. Once they fitted in, they are however quite secure and work just fine.Monster ULT V1000 CV-4 Ultra 1000 Component Video Cables (4 feet)"

The groups at least, are remakes, perhaps with a band member or 2, but NOT Original as recorded. I believe some of the solo artist songs are original and the live performances are real. Just disappointed they are not all original. So if you are looking for the real thing--this isnt it."
3,Light but good enough for me,"It depends what you care. I don't feel bad even it is most of the time quite light for the ink, but it is sure good enough for me, clean and flush to the DVD's surface--seldom flacking out to my usage. If I need to pay for the pen's shipping, I will not buy it again.I bought it to label CDs because Sharpies (Sanford TM) is vivid, dominant but risky ruining your data over times if you use it on the CD data area. I recently tried a TDK brand, and it was much solid, vivid, and sloppier inks. It is like you compare your friends' note in high school with different styles of writing preferences. They both, TDK and Memorex, are good, to me. You pick what you care and what you want. Three stars are good because most selections for this kind of pen suck. Pricey and not creative, so we happily have to live with it. They don't bother develop good products.Well..., it's just a pen tool. For gifts or important projects, I opt for CD label printout or Lightscribe CDs."
1,Dead markers,"The markers were dried up, but I was given an immediate refund, so I'm happy about that."
2,cd pens,"These Memorex CD marking pens work, but I prefer a finer point, these medium point pens are harder to use."
1,Waste of money.,"I bought mine in Walmart. Two markers were not working from the beginning. Others lasted for few months, but I was not using them very often. I just needed one good marker that would work well. I was also ready to spent some extra money on it. Instead I got bunch of garbage. Very disappointed."
5,"Excellent Product, last a long time.","I have used these type of Memorex cd markers for years, they always work very well."
4,Good for the long life of your data,"I see all the complaints posted about these being light in color, including the one that says ""like water colors"", or not lasting that long, but the watercolor comment is important to keep in mind. These are the only CD/DVD markers I've found that clearly state they use a water-based ink. That's what you want for labeling your CDs. A solvent-based marker, like a Sharpie, will eventually cause damage to your disc and so corrupt the data on the disc. I'm not saying these are great markers, but I use them because I trust that they won't eventually damage my recordings, and that's more important than the colors being a little light or the markers running out after a few hundred discs. Worth the price of having to buy them more often to know that 10 years from now my movie/music/data will still be good."
2,Not very good,"As everyone else said, these markes are light. They dont mark very darkly or clearly. The ink beads up like it would a normal pen writing on a cd. Although it drys and appears to be permanant(they claim to be permanant). I would not reccommend this product. But they do work if you cant get hands on anything else, like me."
1,hard to write,"i was hoping with the memorex name that these pens would be better, but no, after one use they kind of dryout and hardly useable, even with the lid on it they appear to dry out."
1,Writes Like a Paint Brush,"I bought these at best buys and what a waste of money. After I just opened it and started to write on the discs, all the pens did not write clear and some were dryed out. Only the red worked fine but the rest smudged all over the disc like it was a paint brush. Save yourself from a headache, don't buy these markers."
1,HORRIBLE,"It's amazing how totally worthless these markers are. Get the Sharpie CD/DVD markers instead, which are great."
1,Can barely read it.,"Poor quality. Doesn't matter how hard you write or how many time you go over it, the ink is still extremely light. Doesn't look like they tested the pens on actual cd's before mass producing them."
1,AWFUL,"These are NOTHING like Sharpie's. They are EXTREMELY LIGHT... Damn near impossible to read. Like the other person said, ""watercolors"", only a bit lighter, if you can imagine that. I'm sorry that I bought them. Go with labels if you can afford it."
3,had to but two,It didn't last long and the patch kit was useless. But it was great for baths until he could go into a big tub.
5,Excellent Infant Tub,"I've been searching for the perfect tub for my baby and I think I've found it! We've been using a plastic reclined tub since he was born, but he has clearly outgrown it. I tried one of those seat tubs(?), but he hated it and it seemed to scratch his legs ... TERRIBLE tub. Thankfully I was able to return that one. I found this one here on Amazon and reluctantly purchased it. Glad I did!! It allows a lot more freedom for him to explore and play (now that he can sit up unsupported). Bath time has become much more fun ... for both mom & baby!UPDATE : i first reviewed this after we purchased the item. I've been using it for just over 1 month now and one of the seams has already torn. I don't think i've used this item improperly to cause it to happen sooner than ""expected"". Unfortunately, the patch-kit piece that came with the tub is significantly too small to patch it up completely. Very unfortunate because we loved the tub.New rating : 3 stars because of how quickly the seam tore"
3,"great product, didn't last","My daughter loves this tub, and it allows us to use far less water. My critique is that the tub didn't even last a year before it started to develop leaks along a seam. We patched the first leak, but it soon became obvious that the entire seem was faulty. My advice: the tub is a great item, and I am buying a replacement, but I wouldn't bother with the ""deluxe"" version--go with the cheaper model incase the seam issue is not just a problem we had.Update: we bought the replacement tub, and after only a few months, it has already sprung a leak in the seams. A very poorly made product, and a great disappointment. Although my daughter loves it, the lack of durability makes it a waste of money."
4,Splish Splash Safety,"My daughter outgrew her newborn/infant tub quicker than I had expected and I saw this one online and it looked pretty safe and easy to set up.She loves to play with the rings and trying to get the ducky who just happens to ""quack"" at her when she's not looking. It goes great with my duck motif and it is safe and easy to drain.The only thing that made it 4 stars instead of 5, (And I can't think of a way to make it any better in this aspect) is that it is kinda big and in the way when I need to take a shower."
2,Strong smell,"Can't rate this product based on its durability since didn't use it much. However, I didn't like the smell of the plastic its made of. After a week outdoors and a good soap wash, it still smells strong. Did anyone had the same experience? Or it's just me..."
5,My son loves tubtime in the Snug-Tub,"I bought this tub when my son was 6 mos old and had started sitting up comfortably. He loves it! He wriggles and splashes a lot, so this is the perfect tub for him. The cushioned sides keep him safe and it fits snugly in the regular bathtub so there isn't water all over the floor. Plus, it saves on water because we don't have to fill up a big tub. I would highly recommend this."
3,Great for shower stall. Not really tough.,"I love this tub. When my son was almost 7 months old, he was great at sitting up and just outgrowing his infant tub. Living in an apartment with only a shower stall we needed something new to bathe him in. He & I both love the tub. But after only a few weeks of using it I got a cut in it. I would highly recommend the tub but caution parents that it is easy to tear. Be very careful where you store it and what's around it. I'm ordering at least one or two more. I love it and it is GREAT for me. I absolutely love it. My son likes to kick and splash around and loves the rings. Great tub!!!!"
5,Perfect for the Swiss Army Knife,Great item to pair with the Swiss Army Knife. The knife fits perfectly snug in the holder. I purchased this for my husband as a gift with his new knife.
4,Less likely to lose your pocket knife with this product,"I always carry a tinker knife with me and though I've never lost it, there have been times that I've had to dig into the bottom of a bag to find it if I don't put it back in my pocket. Having the tinker in this pouch makes it much easier to locate. This is a nice pouch that has a reliable velcro closure and is still small enough to slip into your pocket without any bulk, unless you're some fashionista who wears super slim jeans, in which case you're probably not the type who thinks about the everyday practicalities of having a tinker on you. It's got a nice belt loop that would accommodate all but the widest of belts. I also think it keeps your knife cleaner since lint won't get into it. There's really nothing all that fancy about it, but is an inexpensive, practical way to hold a tinker and keep it free of lint."
4,Fits Perfect,"On time delvery, solid quality and price. My Swiss knife fits perfectly. I recommend that you purchase a genuine Swiss pouch for your Swill Army Knofe.DA"
3,Ok little pouch.,"My wife got me this pouch to go with my swiss army knife. While this knife fits snugly in the pouch, the pouch does not want to close all the way on my knife (champion plus pocket knife). When this happens the Velcro on the flap is not all the way down, and can catch on your shirt and therefore open the pouch when you do not want it too. So far the knife has remained safely in the pocket but I would like it to be a little bigger."
4,Perfect for lot of Swiss Army Knife products...bit small for some,"I purchased this pouch/case at the time of buying Champion Plus Swiss Army Knife by Victorinox. The pouch is good with welcro lock and I love the logo on it. But it is a little small for my SAK Champion Plus as the knife just fits in it right but the pouch doesn't close completely. I would have to force it a little to lock the flap with welcro. I give it 4 stars for its design, presentation and quality. You would have to have even smaller Swiss Army Knife than Champion Plus to get a comfortable fit. By all means, if I had more details, I would have bought a bigger case/pouch of the same kind for my tool. If you can fit your tool into this case/pouch then consider it as a 5-star rating."
4,"For Americans, Norwegians, WW II Historians, and Royalists","If this program had been 5 times longer, it still wouldn't have been long enough for me. In observance of the 2005 centennial of the Norwegian monarchy and the unveiling of a Marta statue in front of the Norwegian embassy in Washington, the Norwegian-American Foundation has produced a fascinating biography of Crown Princess Marta of Norway. It focuses on her 1940-45 stay in America while Norway was under Nazi occupation, and is full of rare film and commentary by such people as her daughter Princess Astrid. The program blends the larger issues of world war with the life of someone who has become semi-obscure from a U.S. viewpoint. History doesn't get any better than that, in my view."
5,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2006 With GPS Locator,"I have used Microsoft Streets and Trips in the past, this was my first time with the GPS included. It has been helpful in getting to my desired destinations as well as pinpointing current location. I recommend this product."
4,2006 Streets and Trips w/ GPS,I found that the software and GPs was very easy to set up and get running quick. Easy to load and operate on Laptop PC.My only wish would be that updates to this software be avaiable during the year with down loads. Found some streets are not on software.
3,"Title updated, but not streets",I use this program daily for locating addresses and printing maps. I also use printed street maps and on-line maps to locate newer construction. Microsoft is behind as much as several years on some subdivisions. I will look for alternatives before buying the next update.
2,Bad in GPS functionality,"The map software is well designed. But it is bad in GPS functionality, which is my main goal to buy it.1.The voice prompt is very bad and very user-infriendly. It only tells you just ONCE which direction to turn when you are very close to intersection, instead of giving several prompts in certain distance away or telling the road name you are turning to.2.The off-track-and-reroute function can not be automatic. Every time you are off the initially designed track, you only can hear the noise which keeps saying ""You are off the road"" and cannot get re-route unless you press F3, which is too much while I am driving.3.The satellite signal receiver is not reliable. It can stop working or recognize totally wrong location, but I can't do nothing to help.If you want to use it as a GPS driving guide, please be aware of these three inconviences."
2,outdated hassle,bought this years ago. It was a waste of time. I had to pack my laptop around with me everywhere I went. What a pain! I am so glad Garmin came out with affordable GPS units.
3,Not bad - But the maps are WAY out of date and NO WAY to UPDATE them :(,"I am very happy with this software except for one major sticking point. The maps are very out of date. If you are going to any new areas that were constructed in the last 4 years, forget it. and - no updates."
4,"Great for Notebook Pc, Poor Function for Pocket PC","I bought this for use on my pocket pc. Very Disappointed, but great for notebook pc or desktop pc as it allows for full function of the software."
5,Great Product and Price,"This is a great product for the price. If you have a laptop,then you have GPS travel capabilities for $100 or less. Most of the stand alone GPS tracking systems run at least $300 plus. I have been using this for almost a month now and it has located every address that I have entered. I love it and recommend it highly."
4,Good GPS for the price.,"I've had this for a few weeks now and have used it a couple of times. The software is nice. Contrary to what i've heard in reviews you can drag and drop the route as you like and it has many places of interest for travel. The suction cup for the GPS also works fine. I've heard others say you can get a nicer GPS that tracks with up to 20 satelittes at once. This one can only track 12, however i've never gotten tracked by more than 5 at once so I don't see that even mattering. My only problem with the gps is that i can never seem to get a signal when it's raining. Right now for example i've been sitting with it plugged in for 20 minutes and it just got done raining and is now cloudy and still no signal. On other days in this very spot i get a perfect signal. It may also be sattelite position though, i'm not certain. All and all you get what you pay for."
1,horrible,"GPS unit will not work despite long phone support help from Microsoft and Pharos (GPS hardware supplier)Software interface is clunky, inefficientI'm throwing it away and shopping for a different solution"
4,Good Product,Does what it's suppose to do. Sometimes u feel lazy in setting it up in the car. Next time I will buy a Real GPS instead.
3,Initial observation.,1. Price was right. 2. At least 3 years behind highway construction in the Phoenix area. 3. Not overly user friendly. 4. Like the coverage for main roads in Mexico.
4,Works great but was difficult to install,I have bought this program since 1998. I love it and still do. Voice directions are a great new feature. This product gave me trouble installing it. Two calls to Microsoft later I was up and running. Price on Amazon was competitive also.
3,Microsoft Streets and Trips,"Was a good help in the early days of GPS, when specialized devices were basic and expensive. Now it's outdated. The only advantage left is relatively bigger screen of your laptop which someone (your passenger) will have to hold in their lap. Compare to modern specialized GPS devices this product is quite a bit behind the market: not enough flexibility, unclear and at times confusing directional instructions, faulty rerouting. Useful maybe in planning a trip but Google Maps is better these days. Get yourself a good Garmin and you will be much better off."
2,Not for in-car navigation,"Streets and Trips 2006 w/ the GPS locator should not be used as an in-car GPS system. The in-car navigation is less than optimal and is not safe for a single person to use. Navigation does nt inform the driver or user of when to take a specific road when a road/highway split, which causes huge issues when you are trying to navigate in any type of major metro area.Pros:1. You can map trips without logging on to a web site2. Has quite a few points of interests for finding restaurants, etc.Cons:1. Not for in car navigation2. Does not inform the navigator on which way to go when a road splits3. Driving instructions are no better than most of the websites that provide free directions"
2,Dissappointed,This item was very dissappointing. I was anticipating a tool that would be able to show me simply where I was and how to get somewhere. You could say it does that but I won't... a red dot in an empty field where a 7 year old subdivision should be is not very accurate mapping. The GPS appeared to be working but the mapping software is severely outdated and not at all impressive. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone that can at least read a road sign.
3,No Voice Road Guidance Appears,"Just got it. However, it keeps saying ""text-to-speech component has encounted a problem"" and no voice road guidance appears. THis problem still exists after reinstall the program. ..."
3,Police use,"I use this GPS in my patrol car. My only complaint is that it doesn't accept cross streets to locate an intersection. You can only locate the cross streets by using numbers, or ""hundred blocks"" ex: 12000 block of A st. Can't use ""A St & Smith St"". Then, you also have to put in the city, state, zip code too. Too bad it doesn't default to a city."
4,"Pretty good, but you'll be dependend on some extra device","I really liked this device when I got it. I have a dell laptop with a AC for the car and while its pretty combersome I really like having it. It has great reception and the voice prompt keeps me from looking at the screen all the time. All the functions are really helpful.The qualms that I have with this device is that you need to carry a laptop or pda (though i'm not sure if the gps would work - there aren't many pda's with usb). The whole setup ends up being pretty big and takes up the entire passenger seat. Additionally you need to boot up the compter everytime you want to use it...and if your speakers are quiet you'll need a usb headset or a line going into your car audio system to listen to the directions. I wish I had a smaller laptop and one with a better battery - if you have all that I would get this device, otherwise it may be a better idea to get the gps nav. computer with screen and everything attached to it (Garmin and whatnot)."
3,"Great to have a GPS, but not without quirks","Pros :1. A mapping software that I have used for 5 years... same Streets and Trips. No learning curve there2. Nice auto pan and zoomCons:1. The audio directions occur only just before the turn I need to make, does not give me enough time to change lanes etc (this could be big issue in NY and NY area :). In other s/ws Delrome, Tom Tom etc you get more than one prompts. But Streets & Trips gives only one announcement and that too only about .1 - .2 miles before you gotta make the turn or take an exit.2. Voice prompts are text-to-speech, and not the pre-recorded voice, which I think is better to understand3. Voice volume is very low, even though I have changed and played with all my Windows XP as well as laptop volume settings.4. No indication of 'miles to destination' - it shoul be in bif bolds."
4,I like it,The product was exactly what I expected to be. It has many nice features including the voice navigation. To effectively use this product you need a car charger for your lap top.
4,It works,"It works, it is a tad akward to use and would be much more conveniant if you could upgrade it rather than just buy a new one every few years"
3,Microsoft Streets and Trips w/GPST 2007,"Pros: CostCons: We planned our first trip and it couldn't find Paragon Casino Resort in Marksville, LA. The Casino/RV resort has been there for years.It put it in Alexandria which would have totally screwed up our trip if we had depended on it to find it. MapQuest has the correct location and plotted the trip correctly. Evidently they are NOT updating the database and you can't contact them with the ID they provide...email comes back.Disappointed in the product...but it's cheap...what can you say?"
4,Objective Review,"I use it quite often and have been impressed with the accuracy of elevation, speed readings and generally accuracy of the route planner except that on a very recent trip from Washington State to Nevada it routed me on highways that are closed in winter so had I not already known about this I would have lost many miles and backtracked. The GPS is awesome but the route planner needs updated."
3,"OK as a map, not so good as a GPS","I found this product more useful as a ""portable"" map than a GPS. Its biggest problem is the lack of wrong way recalculation. So if I go a wrong way, I have to park my car and find my way back. I bought a portable GPS eventually, and found it much useful than this product."
4,It got me to Vegas!,"The 2006 is the third edition of Streets and Trips that I have owned, and it just keeps getting better. The only problem that I have is with my laptop, not the product. My laptop display washes out in bright light, so I try to keep it covered. The GPS works very well, and when I met my wife in Vegas, I got off track a few times. It shows up when you have a GPS trail. My wife laughed at the lines going in circles when she looked at my trip."
3,"Software improved, GPS receiver OK","Actually I bought the 2005 version with the GPS receiver, I have a friend who just bought the 2006 version. I noticed that the software has improved, especially with the void guidance feature.However, be aware of the cable and laptop inconvenience.I bought a bluetooth adapter and use a PDA with it, worked very well for about 1.5 years. However, the GPS receiver died several days ago. As far as I know, Microsoft only supports 1 year customer service, after that, you need to pay $35 for a phone call."
4,I love it!,I loved it so much I had to get one for my Son too. He is in sales and travels alot. He uses it to store his clients info and just sets it up before he leaves. It takes him to each and every stop throughout central Florida.
1,What's the point,"The whole reason I wanted a GPS system is because I am bad with directions. This product, though semi-up-to-date with roads in the area, is only good if you don't miss your turns. If you miss a turn it says ""off route"" over and over again but it doesn't recalculate your route for you. And if you're the one driving, you can't exactly reroute from your current location if you're trying to watch the road. Lucky for me, the store I bought this from allowed me to return it since it was hardware and software. I wouldn't recomend this product to anyone. There are many other products out there that are much more user friendly and less costly. I would definitely recomend Garmin 18 with Nroute instead."
5,Easy to Install and Use,This is the easiest and least expensive GPS system available!!! My mother (who is non-technical) can use this system.
4,one of these must-have software,"I have been using MS Street & Trip since 2000. This 2006 version is an update for me, mostly because of the added GPS function. Although all kinds of maps are availabel on the web, it is still a must to have a copy of software like this installed on our portable laptop. The map part may not be very different than earlier versions, except a few fix and updates here and there. It is the added GPS function that make it really part of our daily life."
3,Nice to have it if you don't have any other ....,"small personal or built-in GPS unit.If your budget allows, go GET a tom tom or garmin.My real experience, from booting up my laptop to finally locate me & my destination. 5+ minutes.Buy or Pass ? My wallet is small, this unit serves me well with this purpose."
1,Very OLD data- No UPDATES,3rd party data: RMS offers NO UPDATES to MAPS: Claims it can't be done: BS: Many Interstates (3 digit) OPEN FOR YEARS are NOT listed.Spend your $$$ for a quality product that CAN be updated.
3,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2006 With GPS Locator,"This Microsoft GPS system for the notebook computer is priced so anyone can have the advantage of GPS in any vehicle. It takes some time to learn but it isn't too difficult for the person with average computer software experience to figure out. On my notebook the verbal directions could only be heard with the windows up. That was due to the volume limits of my notebook speakers. The GPS lost signal frequently while driving. It was difficult to look at the computer screen for directions while driving. And, in sunlight the computer screen was a little hard to see. But, for the price, around $90, it is a good system to have in the car on long trips. Otherwise, a GPS system designed for the car, which could cost several hundred more, would be a better system to use while driving."
5,Check these out! Fantastic headphones PLUS a free 8 gb ipod!,"Not only do these babies deliver but Able Planet has a sweet deal going where when you buy them they give you an 8 gb ipod touch! I don't know how long they will be offering this so you might want to take advantage of this NOW! I got these for my son who is a videographer & he is EXTREMELY pleased. This has made editing the sound MUCH easier! So if these are for yourself or a gift, I think you will be happy! They also have an 8gb nano offer for the headphones 1 step below these in price, they are the Sound ClarityAround-the-Ear Active Noise Canceling Headphones, so check them out, I'm sure 1 of these will be just the ticket for you!!"
1,Poor Fidelity and Noise Cancelling Feature,"I purchased the Able Planet Clear Harmony Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones based on the reviews I read. I'm very disappointed in both the noise cancelling feature, that was poor at best, and the sound quality. The fidelity is very poor on the high end and doesn't even come close to my $99 Sennheiser HD 280 Pro's. As a matter of fact, my Sennheisers have less noise transmission with no noise cancelling circuit. These headphones were not for me and I have returned them."
1,not recommend,"all three HDD works for few days only, I didn't complain because it is works at first place, but my Dell computer won't read 1st and 2nd HDD about 2-3 days after intall the Window XP, the third HDD failed during Window installation."
1,This is Spurious and I'm Furious,"Note this line from the the book's copyright page:The characters, incidents and situations in this book are imaginary, though they have relations to persons who have lived.. . . in other words, this book is fiction, even though the back cover describes it as ""historical"". It's good that it's labelled as imaginary inside, but unfortuately I didn't notice this until after I'd spent my $$. Save your money."
1,This book was a sham!,"This book was a sham!I applaud the content. It was beautiful...touching. If only it was...true.The information on this book's cover and back cover is misleading, very badly designed. I was deeply disappointed to learn that the diary was fictional after I had gotten to the middle of the book. You can imagine how disappointing that is for someone who is a big fan of Charles Dickens.Besides I don't understand who exactly the author is and what does the ""unitarian minister"" in hard times have to do with it?Again, this book is confusing.Do not buy unless you are sure you're ok with it being fictional!"
4,Zolo and Cabji's duel.,"I pretty much liked the duel between Zolo and Cabji.But I think there's to much blood and violance.And to much swearing!Agghh,I hate swaering!But,who cares?It was still good!"
1,Shoddy design,"I purchased five of these power strips for the office, thinking that any 12-port power strip would be just like the others we have here. Each and every one of them is in danger of falling to pieces, the outlets themselves are constantly coming loose exposing bare wiring and touching the metal frame. On more than one occasion the internal wiring to an outlet has touched the metal frame, making the frame live and tripping the circuit breakers at the offices. Once we even thought we had toasted an expensive Mac Book Pro. Stay clear of this particular brand. It sucks. There are better ones out there for the same price."
1,The Worst product ever made!!!,"I ordered this product thinking that it was going to get to me within a couple of days but it had to be shipped from some other company and it took forever to get to me. Then I canceled the order and it came to me 2 days later and when it did it was all dirty, dented and banged up, the outlets were loose and I was surprised that it even worked, I was very unsatisfied with this product and highly recommend not buying it. Poor Quality!!Brian C.BrooklynNew York"
4,amazing board,"I bought this board a few weeks ago at my local skate shop and I've fallen in love with it, the trucks are especially amazing: very smooth and the design eliminates any chance for wheel bite. The deck is also great, its from arbor so it of course has the signature layer of koa on top of the 7ply maple which I love because it makes the board a bit stiffer and stronger. My only complaint would be that it stands a fair bit higher than I was used to, which helps when you're carving downhill but makes cruising slightly awkward until you get used to it (which shouldn't be long). The bearings aren't bad but I would still recommend upgrading to a set of bones when you get the chance"
1,Don't waste your money on this book!,"This book contains too much errors and not enough structure to be of use for someone that really wants to know about Internet directories in general and LDAP in particular. The text just babbles on, mixing ASN.1 encoding details with data model descriptions with communication protocols. Also, many of the examples in the book contain errors and/or do not correspond to the text referring to them. The book does give you an overview of different types of Internet directories, but it contains too much distracting details to be advised for that purpose. I bought this book because of some enthousiastic reviews here at Amazon, but I was greatly disappointed."
1,terrible,This has to be the worst movie I have ever had to sit through. It was so bad that I actually fell asleep half way through.
5,love this great product,this cable is great it works perfect no complaints video looks great with this. everyone with a ps3 should spring for this its a great thing if you wanna have super clear ultra-realistic gameplay. Some HDMI cables can be cheap but this one has alot of quality and it looks really cool.
3,Loose connections,"Product works fine, as long as the cables are never moved. Any little jostle would cause signal loss.I have another Nyko cable (red and Black, smooth cable, the one I received for this item was green and black) that does not have the same issue..."
4,wonderful,this product works perfect. it was cheap and it probably works the same as another hdmi cable for $35.00 cheaper
5,HDMI cables,"Awesome product, shipped quickly and was pleased. No need to pay for expensive HDMI cables. Save yourself some money and go with this product."
5,Super High Quality Cable,"This is one amazing HDMI cable, expensive yes. But the quality is superb! This is not a cheap walmart cable, this is a really nice cable, I get a good video coming out of this, very nice cable! I plan on using this for a long time for my PS3.I also like that it has nice gold ends, and it stays in the port and wont come out. I can't wait to use this for our new 7.1 THX sound system.Great cable!"
3,Doesnt look like what is pictured,"This product isnt what is pictured. It is a PS3 HDMI, but it doesnt have the red special ends or the mesh on the cable. It was just a plain black HDMI cable. It works fine between my cable box and reciever, but I wouldnt put it on my PS3 or XBOX360."
5,"Does what it's supposed to do, and does it well","My local ""blue and yellow"" big name electronics store (which I do love) does alright on most pricing, but fails miserably when it comes to high-end a/v cables. Best off-brand PS3 HDMI cable price? $[...]. Yikes! This $[...] cable is plenty long enough and delivers excellent video performance for both gaming and blu-ray movies. I'm using it with the Oppo Digital HM-31 HDMI switch as my TV has only one HDMI input. Highly recommend both products (available right here on Amazon!)"
2,"Not an ""all sides"" mold - flat back side","I never actually used this mold - I purchased and returned it for credit. This mold is not a full 360 degree / all sides mold. Instead, it will produce a mold that has details for the ""front only"", but the back side will be ""flat"". The mold is more of a ""jello"" or ""cake pan"" type of mold. You don't stand the mold upright and fill with water, rather you lay the mold down flat and fill it. The actual plastic mold is not shown in this listing, only the finished product. Note that the photo of the finished product only shows a view from the front. I think it would look good if you just wanted the final product to be seen only from the front, but if you wanted an ice sculpture that would look good from any side, this will not work well for you."
5,Historically accurate - wonderful book!,"Every culture has their myths, legends and stories which are handed down through the ages with reverence and respect. In this era of commercializing and rewriting every classic that comes along, it is refreshing to find books such as this--that honor the original telling. Not only is the story historically accurate, but the beautiful pictures are as well, and this book is a must for any lover of Chinese history and/or for parents wishing to explain their ""roots"" to their children. I loved it!"
3,Decent interpretation with Chinese as well as English.,"This is a simple and clear presentation of the story. I'm not familiar with the original poem, so can't say if it is completely accurate to the original. The illustrations seem very Chinese in style, and I really like them. I plan to get more books in this series.The English is at a level that my 3rd grader can read it by herself, and it has the story, side by side, in simplified Chinese characters (some easy to read typewriter font, not the original calligraphy). The Chinese story is simple enough that kids who are learning Chinese should be able to make headway with it."
5,"Great delivery, was in fine shape when I recieved it.","Eric Butterworth and his wife are responsible for the teachings of The School of Unity, which I call my church. I want to read everything I can that he writes, as well as some of the optional writers, some connected with Unity others not. I think that Unity is a very progressive group, and welcomes everybody, no matter what they're personal beliefs are. Lee R."
2,Not a great book.,"I am a Support Analyst dealing applications/Services in OAS. I bought this book for OCA preparation. After halfway through this, I don't feel the stuff in this book is enough for a OCA exam. The book is not a in-detail material for OAS. It does not explain the configuration differences in each configuration files clearly. The author certainly lacks practical knowledge in OAS. I may have to go for the OCA book from Sybex too before appearing for OCA exam."
1,A very confusing book,A very confusing book. It actually describes the Exam 1Z1-311 and not 1Z0-311 as it is stated here on Amazon.com. The 1Z1-311 exam is a beta exam and not available at Oracle any more.Besides that the book consists of a lot of copy/paste sentences from Oracle documentation set. I dropped the book and started to read the documentation set instead.
5,These are great.,I love it as you can see the lights on it and what it is doing. I feel very assured with this; not like the clumsy strips I use to use. I bought 4 of them for all major appliances in my home.
4,Ugly but seems to work,"Since using this suppressor, I haven't a problem. It's big and bulky, but seems to do the trick."
2,It's okay...,"Wow, this guy REALLY likes to toot his own horn (about how successful he is, blah blah blah...)! The story's not bad - it's kind of interesting, but the victim has such an air of self-importance that is a real turn-off. The part of the story describing his actual captivity is interesting, but the last few chapters of the kidnappers being brought to justice are realllly long and boring - I ended up just skimming through the end - It could have been 'wrapped up' in fewer pages. Over all, what happened to this guy is bad & scary, I'm sure, but he wasn't hurt physically at all & he was let go...I've read a lot better true crime stories of people who were held in captivity & lived to tell about it (such as ""I Know My First Name Is Steven"" or ""Perfect Victim."") This one was just okay."
3,Interesting book,"Pleased with prompt delivery; used book was in good condition as advertised. Very interesting (true) story, however the 'aftermath' was not as easy (or interesting)to read as the first part was."
1,Wow.,"Do that many people really like this book? I will admit, I read it quite quickly (kept my attention) & thoroughly because I kept thinking: is this guy for real? While I am relieved Alpert got out of such a harrowing ordeal alive, his book frustrated me. He seemed to learn nothing from what happened (""I love the east village, okay I'll spring for a parking spot""). Also his on & on about how rough & scrappy his growing up was for a white boy in Brooklyn: whose upbringing wasn't difficult? I also found it to be borderline racist at times. Ugh. I am going to stop there. Ok, one more thing, the tone & the writing -- errr, a bit strange puffed up, faux tough guy. I am sorry to write such a bad review, but the book really rubbed me the wrong way on many levels & I simply cannot understand how so many people have written so many glowing reviews here."
2,Poorly written,"I ordered this book after reading a great review in the New York Times and hearing him interviewed on NPR. Both of those were vastly better than the book itself. For this I do not blame the author who is not a writer by trade. I blame the publisher and editors. They couldn't help him out and make it less like a high-school essay? Stream his interview, its a lot more entertaining!"
2,"It's not all about the presents, Stanley!","You know how you feel when you eat that muffin or cookie that looks really good, but ends up being dry, tasteless, and a complete waste of calories? And you keep eating it because it's there, and it might improve (but never does)? That's how it felt to me to buy and read this book. It had so much potential. The title is great. The story is real. But it's poorly written, by an annoyingly arrogant and apparently editor-less man. His clinical writing (he seems to be writing a legal brief for most of the book) fails to convey the terror he must have felt. The last half of the book is particularly grueling, and the ""lessons learned"" are juvenile and materialistic (Oh, Stanley, a Cabrio??). Being kidnapped was probably the best thing ever to happen to Stanley. Too bad the experience didn't effect the change he seems to think it did (or result in the great read it could have)."
2,"Annoying author, good book","I have to say I did enjoy this books as most people will IF you can get past Stanley's arrogance and extremely high opinion of himself.The story does hold you but I found myself struggling to care enough about him. He comes across as the most annoying, self-centered person. There were times I wanted to put the book down, not because of the story but because of Stanley.As one other reviewer notes, at times he appears to come off as very racist, even though he always puts a CYA statement in to make you feel like he is not.Read the book for the story but it definatley loses impact because of the lack of feeling you have for Stanley."
4,HAPPY Birthday,"I first heard about THE BIRTHDAY PARTY during an NPR interview with authoer Stanley Alpert. I'm a filmmaker and thought the story sounded very compelling -- I was not disappointed. Alpert weaves a great yarn, full of humor and suspense while wrapped in a deadly serious and intense background. He also manages to create a certain amount of empathy for his antagonists despite their deeds. A hugely entertaining read, with a wonderful message that anyone can relate too."
5,"An Extraordinary Story, Remarkably Well Done","Stanley Alpert's *The Birthday Party* is a remarkably well done account of an extraordinary story. Of the thousands of books I've read in my life, this one is unique in that the presence of the author's photo is one of the most compelling aspects of the book. Without ruining anything, that Mr. Alpert survived to tell this story borders on the unimaginable. Yet the narrative is so very compelling that *The Birthday Party* remains a page-turner, even though the narrator's voice should make the unlikely but life-affirming conclusion self-evident. In this way, the book resembles the award winning film documentary ""Touching the Void"" (though I liked *The Birthday Party* much better). I can't understand any issues with the writing style -- I found the story compelling, fast-moving and well-crafted. I highly recommend it."
4,Easy Entertaining Read,"The Birthday Party was a great easy read, that I found difficult to put down. As other reviewers have stated, the author comes off as a bit privileged, however it does not take away from what did happen to him. He explains it with great imagery, and even humor at times. Definitely worth picking up."
5,A 10 star book,"Were it possible to give 10 stars, this book would get them. The only reason I had to stop & put this book down was that it was 6am & I hadn't fallen asleep yet. This is an EXCELLENT book for true crime lovers. It's the type of book you may find once a year; the type that are worth losing a nights sleep.With the exception of his remark to Al Sharpton, I'd say this book is perfect."
2,an uneven telling of a compelling story,"A better writer could've made this work. I could imagine a really good long-form magazine piece based on this story, or even a good movie in the hands of the right screenwriter and director.The book works best when Mr Alpert is directly relating his experiences with the kidnappers. I liked almost all of this material, apart from his transliteration of what Sen and Ren are saying when they're not speaking English. Alpert renders this speech in something like a variation on Pig Latin. It's a superficially disguised English which the reader can more or less figure out, and which I think he used as a device to include his guesses as to what they were talking about when they weren't talking English. It's a distraction from the story, more than anything.His recreations of what happened when he wasn't there are much less interesting to read, and unfortunately they take up a large part of the book. By the midpoint of the book I was skipping these sections entirely."
4,"Good story, horrible man","Part of it were difficult to read simply because I hated the author. Stanley Alpert comes across as a self-absorbed jerk who spends much of his book congratulating himself on his achievements, both real (being an assistant US Attorney, managing to survive a harrowing experience) and imaginary (being such a nice human being that God decided to let him live - as if the world weren't full of spectacular people who die early). He's dating a girl, and at the same time he's going out on blind dates and trying to pick up women in the subway. No wonder that, pushing fifty, he's still single.Having said that, if you can get over Alpert's gigantic ego, you'll probably enjoy this book. It tells his experience when he was kidnapped in the West Village, taken to an apartment in Brooklyn, robbed -- and he managed not only to survive but to gather enough information to help the police capture his kidnappers. It's a very good story, told by a very unlikable man."
2,Very disappointing,"After hearing a great interview with the author on NPR, I ordered the book anticipating a great read. I'm sorry to say that I was sorely disappointed. The narrative drags, the protagonist's whining description of his predicament did not bring the natural empathy that the story surely deserves. His portrayal of his abductors never goes beyond the level of stick figure drawings and are filled with superficial stereotypes. I would recommend passing this one up."
2,Birthday Party -- not so happy,"Perhaps it was the hype from some reading friends, but I found this book a total disappointment. I was told the book was ""hilarious!"" It's not remotely funny -- the author's predicament is scary, for sure."
3,Better suited to a magazine article than book,"I respect Stanley enormously for his infinite courage and savvy in surviving his horrific ordeal by managing to bond with his kidnappers enough that they ultimately decide to release rather than kill him; however, given that we know the outcome in advance -- eliminating any suspense-- the 300-pages feel like 275 pages more than was needed to share his story of his 25 hours in capitivity and of the amazingly successful police investigation that captured the gang so soon after Stanley's release. A far more book-worthy story recounts a 9-day ordeal of surviving a kidnapping in Iraq in ""American Hostage: A Memoir of a Journalist Kidnapped in Iraq and the Remarkable Battle to Win His Release"" by Micah Garen . This one is told in less than 300 pages and intersperses the victim's account with chapters describing his girl friend's frenzied efforts to eventually get him freed."
4,an inspiring story of survival,"Truly an inspirational read! This book was picked as a Book Club selection for our club and we all found it to be a testament to man's will to survive.What could have been a tragic story, turned into a story of hope."
5,A real life Lake Woebegone,"This book had me laughing out loud one moment, and sighing wistfully the next. The characters in it seemed so real -- probably because they are real! Anyway, I was very, very moved by the people in this strange and quirky little town. There are some touching and poignant stories in here -- and then some, like the one about the outhouse races, that are a scream."
4,Banter,"Bohjalian rivals Mitch Albom as a journalist and writer of novels. Very well written, light and fun, a satisfying read for any one of any age. Anything he writes is good."
5,Idyll Banter,"Wonderful read! Vermont at its dearest, told with sincerity and love. Bohjalian's books are sharp, intense and realistic. In these stories you'll be taken back to a simpler time, a time you will want to revisit and remember for a long time. Enjoy every minute."
5,800 scorer on SAT IC and IIC,"Unnecessary to buy any book except this. Review all topics, do all the practice tests and go over them each one in detail, and you are guaranteed, seriously, at least above 750 on the actual ones. 800 on all others (Kaplans, Princetons, REA, Barrons) equals a 750 on these tests... I got 800 on real SATS (incredible, seeing as how some math teachers can't even get above 90th)"
2,"Oh man, what a dud.","I cant believe the reviews for this tripe. First of all, this is a Civil War ""era"" film, but actually has very little to nothing to do with the war.The film centers around a squad of Union soldiers on scavenger patrol, who in the process of relieving a woman and son of their chickens and other supplies, suffer a freak injury to one of their troops, and are ""forced"" to hold up at the farmhouse while he heals up. The whole thing is slow slow slow, and entirely acted out on this farm, which does not add to the story or entertainment value at all. Its boring actually, very boring.Dont look for Kris Kristofferson, he only makes a brief cameo. We all know Chris Cooper aint no leading man, and Patricia Clarkson is as droll and depressing as ever. Fine cinematography shines through on the DVD but the audio is just bad, sounds distorted at times. 2 Plows"
2,A Slow Plod,"If you are looking for a Civil War film that includes the rough and tumble of the Blue v Grey battle lines, forget it. After about twenty minutes I started to lose interest in this story consisting of a cast including 5 Union soldiers, 1 Confederate wife her son, a padre and his slave. I was really disappointed that Kris Kristofferson played such a low involvement part in a plot that failed to captivate me.As a UK Civil War re-enactor I suppose I can respect those who viewed the film about man's inhumanity to man (stealing another man's family's food, whilst he's away fighting for the other side) without too much killing being depicted.Unfortunately, I'd much prefer to re-watch Gettysburg, Gods & Generals, Glory etc, which to me are films about the sharp end of the war i.e. the battlefield and the hardship that those fighting in them had to endure, and some of the lunatic decisions made by those that sent them to their sometimes predicatable fate."
3,Not bad,"This is a Civil War movie with a bit of a western flare. Not a bad movie, personally I wish I had purchased a used copy. It may have not been worth the full purchase price to add it to the collection. I'm not sure why Kristofferson is so prominantly displayed on the cover since he's only in the movie for 10 minutes at most..."
5,An Undiscovered Gem,"This historical movie set during the Civil War (and inspired by a true story) is so moving and poignant that it's hard to believe almost nobody saw it when it was new. Chris Cooper, who was so great in ""Americna Beauty"" and ""Lone Star"" and lots of other good movies, is great as a Yankee officer who is sick of war. Patricia Clarkson is wonderful as a Confederate woman whose bitterness is stronger than death."
2,"really thin when it comes out, like Elmer's glue","You can only use this on a horizontal surface, it will run otherwise. Not like caulk, runny like glue until it sets."
2,not as shown in the picture,These CD's were plain and not how they looked in the pic with a swirl of silver.
1,What a disappointment,"Take a look at Mary Martin and Noel Coward in Together with Music (I have an old video of that); listen to Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall (seemingly unavailable on video); then watch this. Seemingly barely rehearsed, this is a bad TV special thrown together hastily to promote the two greatest Dollies while they were performing in the role. Yes, these are two great stars. Yes, that occasionally comes through here, particularly when they are working alone. Yes, there ought to be a full video version of both of the Broadway productions of ""Dolly"", so we could see them really shine: acting, singing and dancing. Still, there was no need to release this video. The fan of either or both these performers would do better to acquire videos of films they have appeared in or to scour compilation tapes from TV variety shows like Ed Sullivan to find those that contain the best of Channing and Bailey. This is decidedly not that."
2,Mismatched performers,"Pearl Bailey has a throwaway style that doesn't match at all well with Carol Channing's broad techniques. The show seems under-rehearsed, and the performers occasionally get in each other's ways. Bottom line: It seems kind of amateurish."
5,"Hello, Dollies!","What a gem! Here's a chance to see what made these two great ladies Broadway queens in the Golden Era of musical theater. Pearl Bailey plays second fiddle here, but her solo sequence is marvelous--earthy and torchy, and as risque as television would allow for the time. But the joy here is Channing, panning Marlene Dietrich and Zero Mostel, and showing why she was, and is, one of the theater's most cherished performers. Best of all is the true live performance these two great ladies deliver--again demonstrating not only why they were such big stars, but also showing us what television had the potential to be. Musical comedy fans, especially you young ones who think theater didn't exist before Les Miserables, must grab this recording for a glimpse into an era regrettably long gone. Sheer heaven."
2,Only worth it for one video,"This DVD has 5 videos from various female 80's singers. All but one of the videos were made in '87-'88, and that one is made by the only singer on this DVD who hasn't been completely forgotten: Frida. The video, ""I Know There's Something Going On"", was made in 1982, the year the group ABBA, of which she was the second female singer (and the second A), broke up. As far as I know, you can't get this video anywhere else, and for $8 it's well worth it for any ABBA or Frida fan. There are some people who will remember the other artists on this disc, but the standout is Frida. Come for the Frida video, stay for the Frida video."
4,Surprisingly Good Sound,"I'd held off on bluetooth headphones for a while, figuring the sound would be too disappointing. Well, with these the sound is excellent. The headphones are very comfortable and insulate against background noise nicely - they're ideal for working in a noisy environment or in the car/airplane. My only complain is it's a little confusing to get them turned on and verify they're actually working. You have to hold the ""phone"" button until it turns SOLID blue."
4,I like this product,I had a crappy pair of blue tooth headphones before so take my advice with a grain of salt. I LOVE the controls to change tracks and volume. You swivel the outer portion of the earphone to make these changes. Battery life is excellent (had these for about 3 months). Sound quality is excellent. I have a large cranium (XL motorcycle helmet) and they fit great. The pads are rubber which makes my ears sweat after a while. I wish they had some optional foam covers. I can only take wearing them for about an hour before it becomes bothersome. The case is super cool. Makes taking them on the road easy. I will not comment on bluetooth signal quality because my Tilt 8900 may be the cause.
3,So So,"Well DJ Headphones they are NOT..! The phone sounds good and the people I talk with have no problem hearing me even with back ground noise. BUT.. the music side of the headphones really sucks. You can't crank it up and even what little bit they do crank the bass crackles, But the power last forever.I drive for hours and never have to recharge them, well not for @least (seems like) 30 hours or so. Non stop for 10 hours or more.They are worth about $30 or less for the limitations."
1,NOTHING AS EXPECTED!!!,"I bought these headphone expecting at least NOISE CANCELING function (As I read other reviews, I don't know if those people received a different model or they're just talking). THIS IS NOT A NOISE CANCELING headphone (as motorola has posted on their website) and I hate the noise coming from the A/C and other people talking in the office. Sound average and with lot of interference. Came in cheap plastic pink wrap, no chord for plug into Audio and no carry-case. I am terribly dissapointed with this purchase, my past motorola purchase was a HT820, they were good but I lost one of the earpads (because they came attached and not fixed) and Motorola Customer Service is simply the worst!!! I will never buy a motorola product again, EVER!!! read this before you buy surprises!!! I give one star 'cause they don't have 0 or -1 stars!!!"
1,Do not purchase,Luckily I ended up begin able to return this item. I was trying to use these headphones with my mac book pro. I also purchased theBluetooth Stereo Gateway DC800 Bluetooth Adapter for Home Stereoin order to use the headset with my TV as well. Let me keep this very simple1/ On the mac book pro the sound is horrible. There is a constant hissing and popping. The sound quality makes this item simply un-usable.2/ When watching movies or TV using the Gateway the sound is delayed from the picture. It makes watching simply unenjoyable.3/ The headphone jack is 1.5mm instead of the normal 3.5mm. Even when I hooked these guys up to use as normal headphones sound only came from one ear.Im sure these work okay for making phone calls or working on skype. But for watching movies or listening to music don't waste your time.
1,VERY UNHAPPY,"The product was sent to the wrong address. The product was delivered broken. Nobody, including Amazon seems to care or want to help."
3,sound quality isn't that great,"i like the material that was used n overall the build quality is sturdy, unfortunately the sound quality isnt that great, i can hear a minute hissing sound in the background of all songs played regardless of the distance the headphones r from my iphone its similar to the hissing sound u might hear in bluetooth headsets, the problem is even more noticeable when drummers hit their symbols, im assuming the speakers in the headphones have a limited range in audio fidelity. these headphones are fine for most people but for audiophiles like me who want pure, clean sound, u may wanna throw down more cash on a better pair."
4,Decent Headphones For The Price,"These headphones sound alright for being bluetooth. There no bose but they're are decent for the average listener. I am happy with them since I payed around 40$ after shipping cost. I use them with my Iphone 3GS. I only will be using during school so I wasn't really looking for some DR Dre or Bose headphones. They didn't smell like some people said theirs did. They weren't in the orginal box but that was expected. I would recommend these to people if you are someone who wants a comfotable, decent set of headphones. For people who listen to bose or any high quality headphones you should aviod these."
5,Affordable and Functional!,"I am no audiophile, and this is my first purchase of wireless headphones. I was searching for new over the ear headphones because I was fed up, and I could not tolerate wires anymore.After researching about different wireless mediums, radio frequency (RF), infra-red (IR), and Bluetooth. I concluded Bluetooth would best suit my conditions of primarily listening to music from my Mac Air laptop - though the headphones did connect with my old Mac Mini(OSX 10.4) as a headset instead of headphone.The headphones are a perfect fit for Mac OSX 10.5+ (access to headphone sound quality, instead of headset sound quality) and above. The functions of the Motorola S805 synchronize with ITUNES! The left side of the headphones toggle volume and the right side plays/pause AND toggles between NEXT and PREVIOUS.Works great as a headset too.Great Battery lifeGood Sound qualityDecent Range of 15-20 feetWirelessGood Comfort for medium sized ears"
2,Avoid. High frequency is terrible,"I purchased 2 pair of these Motorola S805 DJ headphones. I can't believe how lousy these headphones sound. I am not new to stereo bluetooth as I have 2 Jabra sets, the 810 and 620S which are significantly better even though much older. The high notes rattle at any volume. Motorola has no firmware updates available for these.Motorola, you let me down again. When will I learn?"
4,Great Quality and Great Fit,"These things are SICK! :) I got this headset to use at work so I'm not tethered to my desk with an audio cord, and they are just perfect. The first set I got wouldn't charge correctly, but Amazon quickly sent me a new pair and the new ones work great. The controls are all very simple and the range and quality are great with my Class 1 (100 meters) Zoom Bluetooth USB dongle once I updated the bluetooth stack.The only complaint I have is that the headphones are that they're a little big and heavy, but they do come with a pretty cool case!-Thump"
5,Good sound for a good price.,"I was not expecting this quality sound from this headset when I ordered them, sure you can get better, but not for the price. The battery lasts at least as long as advertised, but they get a little uncomfortable after a long period of time due to them getting a little warm. Nothing serious just causes a little sweating around the ear."
4,Bulky But awsome,The headphones work great and were delivered as stated (always a plus) they do everything I thought they would and more with a twist of an ear bud you can turn up the volume or change a track. But these things are bigger than I thought and quite the fashion statement and I feel awkward when I'm talking to my self in a crowd with giant headphones on so there strictly for home use now other than that I love them
2,"Feels sturdy, didn't last long","This is not a good product. The connection would drop, and after only a few months it stopped working entirely. Avoid!"
1,Worst headphones. Ever.,"In general, I feel this has been a terrible purchase and would not recommend these to anyone.Bought mine years ago, apparently came with a factory problem and so the power-on button doesn't always work after it's been charged. The charge time is incredibly long and the battery life is super poor. Even when used with the cable (without powering them on), it discharges so fast that it makes you want to cry."
3,you get what you pay for,Sound quality is medium. headset is very flimsy and feels cheap. Bass is distored at high volume. The headsets are OEM . There not bad headsets but far from the best you get what you pay for.
2,Awful Quality,The worst DJ style headphones ever. Probably worse than iPod earbuds. SO BAD QUALITY. Probably fine if you want to just talk on the phone; people said the voice quality was pretty good. But why would you want DJ style headphones that suck? Just sayin'.
2,"comfort, design, performance all disappointing","Comfort: the ear cups are a little too small for my ears and end up squishing instead of surrounding - not tolerable for long-term listening given the bulk of these cans. Design: it's a big headset so the aesthetic isn't awesome to begin with, but the arch of the headband is more triangular/cone-headed than the pics suggest. Performance: quality seems decent paired w/ an iPhone 3G (3.0 firmware), but the range is ghastly even by BT standards - signal cuts out completely ~15 ft from the phone (I have another A2DP headset that almost doubles that and degrades quality more gracefully on the way out instead of cutting out completely). Thought I'd give these a shot since they're less than half the price of other over-the-ear options, but it's not worth saving the money if you never use the things. Back they go."
2,it literally stinks!,"The unit arrived about a week ago and hooked up quite well. Unfortunately it was wrapped in bubble wrap and cardboard that has a horrible musty and damp smell to it that I can't seem to get rid of. these were in a storage area with alot of humidity and they are making me nauseous. I'm going to try to mask the smell, but I think they are going back. amazon shouldn't be selling this in such a manner."
3,S805 BT headphone,"GOOD:Audio quality is decent, price is great for a wireless headphone, battery is pretty good, look is good.BAD:comfort is only okay in the beginning but even the battery out last the comfort. BT connection loses often and I can't get it to reconnect unless I reboot my PC. Not sure who to blame but since my other Sony headphone didn't have this issue, I have to think the S805 is the problem. This is my biggest complaint about S805."
2,"Cool Looking, terrible quality","These headphones look like they should be so much better but they are terrible, the sound quality is shaky and everyone around you can hear your headphones almost as good as you can."
2,"Good Sound, but won't connect to PC!","The sound on this unit is very good, and it connected to my phone easily, but it will not connect to my PC on XP or Win7, and I used the stock USB adapter form Motorola. If you are looking for something wireless to connect to your PC, do not torture yourself with these headphones it is not worth it, sit down relax, listen to your music and deal with the wire!"
4,Motorola S805 Headset,"Comfortable and functional. I would have like the headphones to work with the power cord plugged in, since I sometimes forget to charge them, but otherwise just what I wanted."
2,terrible range & akward controls,"The fit was fine, sound quality was decent & mic was mediocre, but the BT range was terrible (pocket to head kept cutting out). Also, the controls are akward; instead of pressing a volume up/down button or forward/reverse, you twist the earcups. This might not sound bad, but trust me, it feels strange and looks stupid when you do it."
1,Can't tell you if it works...,Drops out after 5 minutes. I have to stop and restart the Bluetooth adapter. The whole point of buying Bluetooth was to get away from the laptop. Mouse works continuously for hours; this thing: 5.0000 minutes.
2,"Heavy, heavy, heavy","I bought these and the Sony DR-BT22 for comparison. Sony wins outright. The motorola headphones are heavy (you obviously figured out that this was my biggest issue with this set ;-) ). BT22 is much lighter and have better controls, but need to be used with care because of multiple plastic parts. If you are the kind of person to sit on your headphones accidentaly, get the motorola, if not - go with Sony or another set.The sound quality was equally good on both sets."
2,Motorola Headphones,These are good for music but make a terrible headset for phone calls... People on the other end say it is very hard to hear...
2,All parts listed are not included,"The headset works great- it's almost worth the money just for the wireless sound. The phone sound is great when you're wearing them, but can be a little less clear than normal for the person on the other end (still pretty good though). The only problem is that Amazon did not send the carry case or the stereo adapter. I called and they sent me another set missing the exact same pieces. Now they are saying that it's a warehouse issue and they'll discount the headset, which we'll end up doing just to keep the headset, but it's still very frustrating because as of now, I can use them with my itunes library off my computer, but not with my ipod."
2,This is really OEM with NO CASE or CABLE!!,"My friend and I ordered this a few days apart and he got one in retail packaging while I get one in a pink bag that is missing the case AND the 3.5mm cable. The semi-hard case fits the entire headphone as well as the charger and the 3.5mm cable. The 3.5mm cable lets you turn this into a plain wired headset that works even when the headset is off. Both missing items are SUPER useful and that makes me very sad.Otherwise the headset works, as in is capable of communicating with my phone (N95) and my computer (Apple MacBook Pro). I have three problems with the headset:1. N95 sounds pretty good, but it drops for about 1s every five minutes or so.2. MacBook music quality isn't that good, but it appears to be a common complaint because of the MacBook.3. Sound is about ~0.25-0.50 seconds behind whatever is happening on the source. So if you are watching a movie, expect it to be noticeably out of sync. (annoyance will vary by user)"
4,s805,"This seems like a nice product, very comfortable and good sound. The knob for changing tracks did not work and had to return the unit. There were no more in stock, so now I don't have it anymore."
4,Big and loud!,"The headphones were a little larger than I expected, but were very comfortable. The sound quality was very clear although sometimes they stop working for a few seconds, usually near the beginning of a song on my itouch. Wearing them while walking, they sometimes start to slip off of my head unless I adjust them really close to my head."
1,"Works on a Mac, just not very well.","Product arrived without retail packaging, carrying case, 3.5mm jack adapter, manual, warranty info or UPC code. Pretty lame.Pros: easy to pair, great cutting the cord, look nice, fit well, battery life, song skipping & volume control.Cons: highs crack up, static constantly present, sync is completely off when viewing videos.Since I bought these for watching video, this is a deal-breaker.15"" MacBook Pro 2.16OSX Leopard 10.5.6"
1,They just stopped working...,"These were OK when i got them, minor complaint as I have big ears that flare out from my head, and they tended to squish then and as I'm travelling from chicago to Phoenix and back twice a week, they were uncomfortable after the first couple of hours...But the real problem appeared just a copuple of months after I started using them. The headsets would not keep a charge. I would plug them in to charge overnite prior to travel, and the blue lights would light up that it was charging. The next day, on hte plane, I'd thake them out and press the power button and they were dead.Because this would happen irregularly, I've stopped using them and carrying them as the are bulky. Going to find a different headset to use..."
1,cheap quality,clunky..cheaply made and makes ur ear sweat. MAKE SURE YOU GET THIS FROM AMAZON ONLY OR IF USING ANY OTHER VENDER REVIEW THEIR RETURN/EXCHANGE POLICY IF YOU DONT LIKE THEM.
1,Poor High Frequency Resonse,"I have been looking for a quality, high-audio quality set of headphones for use with a wide variety of bluetooth sources, including my T-Mobile Dash, Windows XP, and MAC OS X based systems.Unfortunately, my S805 units didn't rise up the challenge. At first, I considered the source material and/or the source BT transmitter was to blame. However, exhaustive further testing showed that the upper-frequency response of these units just left a lot to be desired. The distortion sounded like digital noise, or the result of clipping of the dynamic range. However, even at low source volumes and amplitudes and headphone volumes and amplitudes the high frequencies just sound awful."
1,Never worked well as phone headset,"In short, this thing never worked for me.At first trial, I could get it to work for about 5 minutes on a phone call with a Nokia E61i. Then it would go dead, and I'd have to manually disconnect and reconnect, to get another 5 minutes. Not a good solution for hour-long conference calls, which is why I bought it.So then I went looking for updated firmware for my Nokia device, thinking maybe its Bluetooth implementation needed updating. A couple of weeks later, I had an update. By then, the Motorola headset would no longer come on. About 10 sec after plugging it into the charger, the lights would go out. Nothing would turn it on, with charger plugged in or not, even after charging for days.I also have to say, the manual is specific that the headset won't work while it's plugged into the charger. What kind of design is that?Will be returning this thing."
5,Please somebody- share Bill Irwin's genius with US!,"""The Regard of Flight"" is an American masterpiece. But most of the American public can only share in it via Youtube clips. Ushering in the neo-post modern theatrical renaissance in a sort of Vaudeville meets Ballet Russes meets Becket- Irwin and friends/props/""moves"" reinhabit the traditional stage and make long overdue slapstick of deconstructive conceptual theatre and post-modern overthink.Somebody, please- make this treasure available (at fair price!) to the people; the children, my niece, my 83 year old father, my students- we need this now. The world needs a laugh- a release of tense complicity- a remembrance of delight- in order to turn and pieface the 21st century!Bill Irwin's genius is to be shared. ""Fool Moon"", many of his shorts, his 2004 PBS performance, and other works should be close at hand."
5,PERFEKT GIFT,The best of the best !!!! Just perfekt!!!Fast Shipping and gut packege!I can just recomended to everybody!!!The perfekt gift!
1,"Everybody Loves Raymond, Complete Series","I'm sorry that I cannot rate this product higher. I love the series but of the 45 disks in the package, 6 were unusable. Althouth this was a new set of disks, 6 were badly scratched and could not be viewed. I gave these as a Christmas present and did not keep the invoice so I could not return the set."
1,"Poor Quality Defective Product, replaced, still defective","Ordered this product - arrived NEW in appearance, all discs seated in hub holders however several discs were scratched and had fingerprints, one disc totally did not play, some episodes on other discs would not play. About 10 of the discs were damaged. Called Amazon, who promptly shipped out a replacement NEW set. The replacement set was even worse. Outer packaging was sealed like NEW and again discs looked to be seated correctly in the packaging, however, several discs were scratched and had fingerprints, and one disc was actually cracked! HBO Home Entertainment should be ashamed at the appallingly poor quality of this product."
5,Everybody Loves Raymond Rocks!,I have been watching refund of this show for years and was delighted to be able to buy the entire series. Although I haven't watched it yet I am anxious to to so. Thanks Amazon!
5,Great fun !,I had never seen all of the episodes (and in order). I laughed out loud lots! There was only a problem viewing one episode (a huge circular scratch on the DVD). Every other DVD of the set was perfect.
4,Loved this series,Well I loved this series ....truly enjoyed it...although I dont understand why should I pay $141 for this DVD series when I can watch it free on streaming on Netflix....Even if I have pay $10per month on Netflix...plus a lot of stuff on the Netflix streaming...somehow the prospect of buying DVD's doesnt make any sense....I dont think this is a masterpiece worth keeping in collection...nevertheless it is something it can be watched on netflix
1,shoddy merchandise,"It seems there is only one manufacturer for this product. When I received it I unwrapped it and played the very first disc, which was the only one that would play. The back of the discs had dye stuck to them from the cardboard containers they were in. The dye would not come off and the ones that did not have dye on them had other blemishes on them that would not let them play. For the amount of money they cost all I got was garbage. I sent them back to Amazon and was refunded. I even went to Wal-mart.com and bought them thinking maybe they might be alright. Made by the same manufacturer and was the same garbage. Returned them and started recording them from TV and cutting the commercials myself. I highly recommend against buying the Everybody Loves Raymond series. They are very poorly manufactured and packaged and should be taken off the shelves and all sent back to the manufacturer."
2,horrible box construction,"I just received this item yesterday, so I haven't had a chance to watch any of the DVDs yet. But my first impression out of the box doesn't bode well. The top of the box itself (a little cardboard house) literally fell apart as I took it off. Rather than go through the hassle of returning this to get a replacement, I'm just going to tape it up. However, I hope this isn't indicative of what's to come once I pop the DVDs into the player.I've only seen a few episodes of this show and really enjoyed it. I just hope that the quality of manufacturing doesn't affect how much I end up enjoying the show!"
3,ELR,"I enjoyed this show, on television, while it was still running. However I didn't have the chance to see all episodes. The entire set is great because I am able to watch it when I want. The only thing I wasn't happy with is the fact that 2 of the discs, have a little bit of skipping.Love this show:)"
1,I'm confused,"One star is for Amazon using the same reviews for two different packages.I have no use for reviews relating to the artistic content of the series. I need reviews that state how well the product is produced and packaged.Is it worth $40 extra for the set that comes in a house? Does the less expensive set have a higher percentage of defective discs?Personally, listening to the Raymond character whine grates on my nerves, but my wife loves the show and wants the complete set. She has the first season which lacks the ""play all"" capability. Are all the discs like that or does the complete series provide the ""play all"" feature for every season?Can anybody give me a run-down on the set they purchased?"
1,movie review,I never received this item and the seller never returned any of my emails. Amazon refunded me the money in a very timely fashion.. so 5 stars to Amazon 0 for the seller!
4,Everybody Loves Raymond,"This is a great set of DVD's with all the episodes, but I wish that there was a ""play all"" selection when watching the DVD's."
5,WELL WORTH THE MONEY,"I have bought some small items from Amazon before (C.D.'S)yet i was worried how the box set of ""Everybody loves Raymond"" would travel.i read some NEGATIVE reviews from costumers in America complaining of damage to the roof of the house.Yet i came across a costumer here in my own country giving POSITIVE feed back.You can NOT buy this box set here in Australia, and they were only available per season dvd's. To buy ALL seasons it would have cost me well over $380 AUD.my box set arrived well before the due date & in EXCELLENT condition. the packaging was fantastic considering the 11,000 mile journey from Chicago to Adelaide.I have some serious t.v. time coming my way as this box set is a HOOT.Everybody loves Raymond may have been produced by Americans for American family thyme,YET it has become one BIG global FAMILY & EVERY family can relate to the Raymond family.Tank You Amazon. JOB WELL DONE!Norm of Adelaide. AustraliaEverybody Loves Raymond: The Complete Series."
5,everybody loves raymond,"when I saw on amzaon the special of the day I was in shock ""everybody loves raymond"" boxed series for $70 I grabbed it. When I got it,it was in mint condition. I'm so happy I got it. I'm enjoying it very much!"
4,Top Notch,"This was a gift for my daughter and we had looked everywhere for it. We found them individually but she wanted them as a series not to mention they were cheaper that way. She loved them! The shipment arrived in a timely manner (somewhat unusual), the product was exactly what we expected. A little pricey but when availability is limited you do what you have to. Overall a good shopping experience."
2,Everybody loves Raymond.,"The item was unsuitable for this market , as the compact disc format cannot be played outside the US. Disappointing."
4,Great series,I did not think I would like this - my wifes choice. It starts out slow in season 1 but rapidly improves with each season.
2,5 Stars for show - 1 Star for Amazon and their beat up products,The good: This show is great! I could recommend it to anyone. The script writers are excellent. If you want laughs from some good clean comedy this show is for you.The bad: The first shipment I got from Amazon was beat up. The series was sent in a DVD case modeled after the house is the show. The DVD case (house) was badly bruised up. Part of the roof was pushed in as well. I returned this to Amazon and they sent out another set. Same problem again. There are huge scratches all over the bottom of the DVD case. The roof is deformed in some places. I have a hard time believing this type of damage is due entirely to shipping.The ugly: Amazon won't send a replacement for the second beat up set they sent out. I have disputed the charge with my cc company. We'll see how that goes.
2,Quality of the DVD is not good (Audio and Video),"We got this DVD set with so much of expectations. Both audio and video quality is not on par with regular DVDs. You will notice the difference very well, if you watch it on anything above 32"" TV.The show is good, and we wanted to watch it without commercial breaks, but as soon we played our first episode, we were disappointed with the quality. The broadcast from the local channels are much better than this DVD. We will give it a try once it is on high definition."
2,"Love the show, hate the product","I was so excited to get this for myself, a holiday steal, 53% off. I can tell you I would have been irate if I had paid full price for this. Everybody Loves Raymond as a show is intelligent and stupid all at the same kind, just the kind of show I like. Unfortunately, probably 75% of the discs that came in this package had residue of colored film from the edges of the packaging it came in. If I knew I had to buy a bottle of Goo Gone and meticulously cleaned most of the discs from all seven seasons, risking ruining them for good, I might have changed my mind. :I"
4,Great content but the box SUCKS!,"I'm not going to review the content because we all know it rocks.I'm a dvd-box collector and let me tell you the construction of the ""house"" box this came with was really bad.It's literally coming apart every time I examine it.It's a nice concept but it should be more sturdy than this.Now I need to buy a glue gun."
2,Very Poor,I purchased the DVD set but when I commenced to play the series half the DVDs were in northern region setting the remainder were in Region 4 (Australia) therefore I spent the $130 dollars for only half a series that I can use. Very annoyed as it was a gift for my son for Christmas.If I knew or it was advertised as a mixture I would not have purchased the series.
5,Exactly as described,I bought a set of DVDs and sent them to my girlfriend as a surprise. I haven't seen them yet but she said the package was a little banged up and the DVDs looked great (WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SELLER SAID. GREAT!!!)
1,dvd of the season 9 are broken,Very disappointed for the expèrience first.And impossible to return the product with my account.The order was received but last DVD was damaged and I realized much later.
5,Cheap & Handy,"I needed a little extra storage on my old, crappy computer so I got this and piggybacked it onto my 20 gig HD. 60 gigs is enough for filing and video/photo storage, and it was reasonably cheap. I'd recommend it if your computer's so old you can't use a SATA II HD but still need a wee bit more storage."
5,So cute!,"Bought these as a gift for someone special... He like them, so I was happy! Good for the price! Thanks!"
4,Very nice!,"They're great, but as they showed to be packed in a box and a gift bag, I didn't asked for gift wrap, too bad they came only in the box (no bag anywhere) so I had to wrap it differently, but that's really a small thing."
3,"no, shakespeare never wrote a musical","this is a loose musical adaptation of the non-musical shakespeare play. it misses the point of the play which was about the absurdity of too much bookish learning and the attendant abuses of the english language. but considering the difficulty of the play's language, substituting songs for words is probably the only way to make lll accessible to middlebrow audiences. what branagh does retain is the lighthearted spirit of the play. i prefer the original, and, if you can, watch the bbc tv shakespeare version of 'love's labour's lost'. it's one of my faves.3 1/2 stars for this unusual adaptation"
4,Light-hearted entertainment,"I found this movie to be fun and a lovely change from the ever serious productions of the Bard. Many people seem to have the misconception that Shakespeare wrote nothing but serious literature when many of his plays were written to please the Renaissance theater crowd...this is obviously one of those plays. Branagh is great at doing Shakespeare differently...he has introduced people to material they wouldn't normally enjoy and he has made many of them visually thrilling. I've found in several of these reviews that the viewer was taking the production far too seriously. The movie was done in musical form as a homage to the bygone era of Hollywood musicals...so what if not all of the cast was exceptional dancers or singers, the point is they were having fun and the viewer is supposed to as well. I for one thoroughly enjoyed the movie...the colors were vibrant, the music classic, and there was much humor to be found."
3,"Not his best, but still entertaining","No, this isn't Henry V, or Much Ado, both of which probably stand as Branagh's best movies. But it's a lot of fun, if you can manage to relinquish a little cynicism and treat the movie as a homage to an earlier type of movie. Plus, in my opinion, the few bits that are just *too* cheezy are easily balanced by great moments. Branagh: ""Worthies, away; the scene begins to cloud."" Probably a movie best suited to Branagh fans, of which I am one, or people who are buffs of old movies. It's not for the viewer who can't let go of the present a little bit and go with the logic of the musical."
2,Fred Astaire Meets Shakespeare,"Normally I am a big fan of Kenneth Branaugh, but this just had too much singing and dancing and not enough substance. Everytime it seems that a character got a little bit heartbroken or needed to let off some ""girl"" or ""boy"" trouble steam, they suddenly turned into Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers. The part where the men were flying in the air singing about love was almost too much for me to stomach.I do credit Martin Scorsese for taking a relatively experimental step with Shakespeare and making it into a jazzy 30s style movie. Many directors would not take such a chance. This is a movie that is more about fun than taking itself too seriously, and if you are the type that enjoys a good musical, this might be a fun movie to take in.I just felt it was too much musical and not enough dialogue, and by the end, I really didn't care about any of the characters."
4,Immensely Charming,"What can you say, it works. The two curmudgeons who disliked the film should be sentenced to see the full play produced on stage for life - because LLL was probably unintelligible even in its own day on stage (tons of in-jokes that were almost certainly dated by 1600), and is completely beyond comprehension in this. What Branagh has done is taken the goassamer elements of the plot, brightened them with some first class songs and wonderful staging (can't say dancing, because almost none of the principals can dance), done one brilliant conflation of the Bard's best lines from the play (toward the end, concerning women's eyes and the lessons to be learned from them, superb editing) and come up with a first class piece of nostalgia, barely Shakespearean, but close enough.So it isn't the pure stuff by a country mile. And yet one does have the feeling that Big Bill himself would have smiled and said, `he's got it exactly right.'"
2,A Letdown of Shakespearean Proportions,"All the elements I usually love are here: vibrant 1930s costuming, Gershwin music, Branagh, Timothy Spall, and did I mention Shakespeare? Instead of a clever, comical, creative and fresh take on one of Shakespeare's lesser known works we instead receive a bizarre mismatch frantically performed by actors who are in way over the heads: Mathew Lillard, Alicia Silverstone and Alessandro Nivola - I'm looking at you. A reprieve goes to Nathan Lane for actually being funny and appearing to understand the meaning behind his lines."
5,Great Version of Love's Labor's Lost,The DVD was in perfect condition as advertised and arrived quickly. I enjoy viewing it over and over again. All went well with this purchase.
1,Give me Hamlet or Henry,KB has done some remarkable work and some trash. This one is sadly the latter. The songs do not work. The sentiments are promising but the staging is hopeless. The Bard is truly adaptable to other times and places buy not this fey one.
4,Delightfully silly,Although this production leaves the ground (literally in one scene) of the text it is a beautiful and delighfully silly film. Love's Labour Lost is a play of wit which delighted Elizabeth's court but demands much of a modern reader/playgoer... but rewards are there for the persistant. Branagh offers a sweetener if you haven't read it.
4,"Unusual, but that's why I like it","This is definitely not for Shakespeare purists, but if you don't take the Bard too seriously, it's cute and fun. The blending of classic Shakespeare with Broadway song and dance routines makes for an unusual experience, which certainly isn't everyone's cup of tea. I think I'm the only person in my household who likes this movie, but that doesn't put a damper on how much I enjoy it."
4,Shakespeare Swings,"Kenneth Branagh introduces his audience to a fresh and sexy side of Shakespeare. He has turned a rather obscure and rarely performed play into a 30's style musical. The melding of song and dance, with the Bard's poetic style is a natural. A rare treat, even if you are not a fan of Shakespeare, you'll love this one."
3,Shakespeare meets Clueless...,"This is the story of 4 men (one of whom is a king) who have taken an oath to study for 3 years without much sleep, even less food, and no interaction with women. What they didn't know was that a princess was already on her way with her friends (3 beautiful women). You can imagine the antics... no need to go into detail.First let me say: I like this movie.That said.... it's like 1920's Shakespeare meets Clueless, and not just because of Alicia Silverstone. If you're looking for a musical with good singing, don't watch this. BUT... if you're looking for a hilarious mock-musical with the real Shakespearian verse, this is for you! The dancing is beautifully done; even Matthew Lillard does a wonderful job. I give it 3 stars out of 5."
5,Love the Nell Sweeney Mysteries!,PB Ryan has become one of my favorite authors right up there next to PD James and MC Beaton. What is it with these ladies using initials but they each write entertaining books.
5,Wonderful Series-Great Read,"I read the first one and liked it well enough that I purchased the 2nd one. Liked it even more and ordered the 3rd. Now I am hooked. I like both Nell and Dr. Hewitt. Often I find one or the other dumb as dirt. But not these two. Acutally, all the charters ring true to the time, place and social status. Each book leads the two closer together - development of the charters. A true romance for the time and the mys is very good. Logical progression. I love a good mys and it is a real bonus when you like the main charters and find the time period interesting too. Plan on reading every single book in series."
3,A Little Weak for Me,"This book is not bad, but it just didn't have what it takes to engage me fully. I liked the historical premise, and the characters were OK, but it didn't give me the entertainment value I seek in a mystery novel. I don' t recall anything objectionable about the language or subject matter."
4,Historical Mystery,"I started with Book one of the series, and enjoyed it so much I had to read all of them. Set in Boston in the late 1800's, the main character is a Governess who finds herself doubling as a detective. Anyone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes may enjoy this series."
5,Murder on a Black Friday,Loved the entire series! I'm suggesting it to all my reader friends. It's romantic and a mystery but still intelligently written.
3,Salty.,"I used this in a Pollo con Arroz recipe and it was salty, salty, salty...Simply Delicioso: A Collection of Everyday Recipes with a Latin Twist"
5,A very entertaining DVD,I am very impressed with this DVD. It has so many features that I spent almost two hours going thru it all. The photos are really incredible and I especially enjoyed the film footage of the Reg IIs exploding. Incredible! This is first rate...and really interesting stuff. I've never heard about any of this before at all.
3,Not same as picture,It works good as it says. We hooked it up to a 20 amp refrigerator and it is only rated for 15 amps. Do not do this as it made all the items in the fridge go bad.
5,Unobtrusively does its job - cheap insurance,"After losing both my wireless router and my cable modem to a power surge during an electrical storm, I started looking for an inexpensive surge protector. I wanted one that would do the job, but wouldn't get in the way. I did quite a bit of research and ended up buying several of these for new router, modem, new cordless phone system, etc. After several months, I've not lost a single device, despite a few electrical storms and intermittant power outages."
3,Too Big,As a surge protector it's working fine. The problem is that it's too big to be able to use both outlets on the plug. It doesn't cover the 2nd plug but takes up all the space in between the two plugs and you can't get another cord plugged into the 2nd plug. I've tried both positions and the other is worse.
2,**WARNING** It covers BOTH outlets,"Despite what other reviewers have said, this outlet covers both outlets, unlike what many reviewers have said. I purchased mine in February 2012. Otherwise, I guess it's okay - we'll see with use if it does what it says!"
4,surge protector,"Recommended by the manufacture of my treadmill, so I purchased it. No problems so far."
1,Blocks the outlet!,Like other reviewers I found out the hard way that it does indeed partially block one of the outlets which then can only be used by the smallest plug-head like a lamp cord. I have an AC adapter and a fat TV power cord going into an outlet and I can't use this surge protector with them together. I would need to buy a short extension cord to accommodate the surge protector and even then it would be a tight squeeze into the outlet. The older design was square and fit perfectly. I have an older one on my other TV with the same set-up and it fits fine. Why they changed the design and made it taller is beyond me but they screwed up! Hey Tripp Lite! Ditch the tall design and go back to what works. If it ain't broke don't fix it!
5,Tripp Lite Spikecube,"Unit is small and compact. It's made by Tripp Lite, so that pretty much says it all. They sell high quality items and these don't disappoint."
4,So far it seems to work just fine 4.0-4.5 STARS,"I plugged in a 19"" LCD TV to surge protector and so far it works as it should. I did discover that the outlets on my 100 yr old house were not grounded so the red led light stays off. I hope when their is a electrical surge I will be protected,I'm going to ground outlet to metal box w/8 inch grounding wire/pigtail available at most hardware stores for only $3-4. If surge protector does not work I only wasted $5-6 not bad & I can resell it."
4,great price,What can one say except if you neeed one this is the best price for my location and works as listed
5,"So far, meeting all my expectations for a travel surge protector.","I am using this surge protector with my Lenovo Thinkpad running off of the wall outlet at the house as well as my 400 watt power inverter in the car. From all the reviews, it is a little piece of mind/insurance to avoid serious damage to my beloved laptop. At this price point, it really is a no brainer for sensitive electronic equipment.This model is dinky small and is great to toss in a laptop bag. I have plugged it in at work and haven't had the first issue with it. It is nice seeing those lights (protected/ground) and give me a little less to worry about when it comes to computer issues.Great so far."
4,a little too large,"Device works well, but it is so large that it makes it hard to use the other plug on a two plug wall outlet. Other than that, the device seems to work well and the lights let you know it is working."
3,A little big,I used this to protect a sub woofer. Works great when you need to protect a single component. The only gripe I have is that it's just big enough to make it nearly impossible to use the second plug receptacle on the outlet.
4,works great,"Bought this as directed for use with a Nordictrack treadmill. It's a good size, doesn't block the other outlet so I can still plug in my computer or cell phone charger while I'm on the treadmill. Meets specifications for protecting a fairly large machine (several horsepower treadmill in my case). very happy with it."
3,Good one for the fans,This is not a bad record - the takes on Mary Poppins songs are original and the end result is interesting. Interesting but not great - I think you would need to be an Ellington (or possibly a Mary Poppins fan) to go for this one as he made so many great albums. I got this as part of a five box CD set available on Amazon UK [...] - I can't find it on Amazon USA. If you are interested I reviewed the whole set in my blog (whose URL is in my profile).
4,Great for slim spaces,"This cabinet was easy to put together and it fit into a space that was very small. It has open shelves, draws and a door on the bottom. I wish it was a little deeper. That would allow me to store towels. Otherwise it is very nice."
1,Nondelivery of product (Arkansas Sportsman ),I placed the subscription order on 11/27/2009 but have not received the first copy of The Arkansas Sportsman which is ridiculous (todays date is 1/31/2010). I have inquired twice to Magazine express and have been given a delivery date of 2/16/2010 which I do not believe. Thus I can not give a review of the product since I have not receive a copy. My suggustion to anyone reading this review is to use a subscription service other than Amazon.
5,There can only be One!,"There can only be one Bill Frisell. After buying 9 of his CD's and finally seeing him live, I bought this DVD. It is a wonderful journey into Bill Frisell and his music. It's not a ""How To"" DVD but a look into his creativity. My wife didn't know his music until I dragged her to the show. Now she's a big fan and she also loved watching the DVD. I will always buy anything he puts out."
5,"An intriguing, thought-provoking film","Jarmusch has once again created a masterpiece film. The casting for this film is perfect with Johnny Depp as the troubled main character William Blake and an excellent performace from Gary Farmer as the esoteric Indian, Nobody. The slow progression of the film brings the viewer into an almost real-time adventure as we travel on a depressing, life-changing, and enlightening adventure. The contrasts which are offered in black and white film give the picture a unique and breathtaking appearence. The soundtrack is composed originally adding another interesting aspect to the film. This film is a sensual adventure of sight and sound. Every time you watch this movie, there is something new and interesting that you pick up on. The lines in the movie are absolutely poetic, rich, and thoughtful. A must see for anyone who is interested in something artful and different from the usual topical nonsense that Hollywood feeds us. This movie is a 10!"
5,Unpoisoned by Hollywood,"This movie breaks all the normal rules for American movies; I could almost believe it's foreign. There is no formula here, just a masterpiece. Amazon.com's reviewer must have a very commercial palette to have disliked it so. I saw it over two years ago and still recommend it to anyone who will listen."
5,"A Breath of Fresh Air, but Not for Everyone","If you find yourself more often than not disappointed by the average cinematic spectacle, if you are the sort of person who is as enchanted by provocative detail as you are by good storytelling, if you have spent any amount of time pondering spiritual existence and can't be mollified by quick and easy stock answers, this movie will become one of your favorites. It is not without its weaknesses (the soundtrack, which is lovely, at one point in the movie becomes too heavy to bear its weight) and it is not for people with short attention spans, but it will leave a lasting impression on you."
5,Unique Movie - It's Great!,I want to give this film one more very positive review. I loved it. I rarely watch movies more than once but this one I paid to see twice at a theater. I have since bought the video and have watched it several more times.
5,A magnificent deconstructionist mythological western,"A unique film ,to be sure, blending Christian, Greek and Native American mythological semiotics with mise en scenes inspired by Fredric Remington, Bev Doolittle and CM Russel. Possibly Director Jamarsh(sp) finest film. Extremely hypnotic and surreal while also brutal, funny and poetic. Featuring a once in a lifetime cast of contemporary character actors, this film is to be sought out and savored. Also captures the Coastal Indian Culture- a feature not usually highlighted in the southwestern-centric western films of old."
3,subtle but not certain,"Good flick, bringing back western movies, but it pretty much just made fun of the era which isnt a bad thing, but for this movie it didn't mix. His Indian pal puts all the real humor in it. He gives Depp wisdom then helps him go on a killing spree."
2,irritating soundtrack,"Neil Young is at his worst on this one dimensional soundtrack of crappy guitar stuff. And it's not that he's not capable. Take for instance the ending song in the movie ""Philadelphia"". It's timeless. But on this one, I could've played better that he did, and I don't even play guitar."
2,Dull and pretentious,"I guess I just don't get it.To describe this movie is pretty much a waste of time. It has to be seen. Only then can someone decide if they like it or not. As for me I thought it was full of itself, boring, and trying way too damn hard to be meaningful.It takes more than characters muttering strange dialogue and dramatic pauses to make a ""Deep"" movie. And having every scene end with a fade out got old real quick. I can't imagine anyone thinking this movie was very good. Certainly, it's not worth hating. It's just kind of okay on the not-very-good side.But I did like all the actors in it who do a fine job of delivering their lines like they actually make some sort of sense. Other than that, a waste of time."
2,"TOTAL piece of boring, pointless crap!","I think you have to be seriously into ""artsy"" crap, or just enjoy electric guitar to enjoy this movie. This movie was incredibly slow, boring and completely pointless. A TOTAL waste of time! And the electric guitar played throughout the movie seemed almost always annoying to me and inappropriate for a (western?).I absolutely would NOT recommend this to anyone."
1,"Uhhh, don't watch this","Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world? No, I'm not refering to Jim Carey in Dumb & Dumber, I am refering to the Neil Young Soundtrack for this movie. I think he played the same annoying note with his out of tune guitar for the entire movie. The movie sucked and was only worsened (is that even a word?) by the soundtrack. Trust me, I felt like a ""Dead Man"" after watching this cinematic torture device. Watch Ishtar or Waterworld instead."
2,interesting but many problems,"I wanted to like this movie and in places I did. Johnny Depp turns in a stellar performance and several of the scenes are interesting in an acid-trip kind of way (I found out after watching this that it's called an ""acid western"") but oh, dear, the sound track is obnoxious and distracting. It's probably twice as loud as the voice track. I missed a lot of dialogue because I had to keep the volume down to keep the guitar boing-oing-oing tolerable.Also -- it really didn't have to be this long. I wasn't looking for an action film, but personally I don't think there's enough substance here for 120 minutes."
3,Stupid F-ing White Man,"I thought this was a very good movie. I like Jim Jarmusch's style and enjoyed Ghost Dog, Broken Flowers and also Coffee and Cigarettes. I liked just about everything about this movie. The black and white gave it a certain old fashioned and also an old Tom Mix kind of style. It had a great all star cast including Iggy Pop in a dress. And that leads me to the wonderful quirkiness of the story and the characters. This is essentially a western in the classic sense but it is also much more. The one complaint that I have is that I personally didn't like Neil Youngs accompanying score. It was just too much for me and I think should have been done more in the 'less is more' style. It seems as though they put a TV in front of him with the movie and every little thing he played a power cord of some kind. Just didn't like it but that was a small complaint.This is a good movie that many don't know about. Check it out."
3,Nice odd independent Jarmusch,"Dead Man is as quirky as any Jarmusch film and I was 45 minutes into it before I decided I liked it. I kept thinking about the things I would highlight in my negative review, but suddenly I was on the wavelength of humor and began to love it. It has no pretensions of looking like a western. Although they ride horses and wear cowboy hats the characters are all firmly entrenched in the modern day.There is a great running bit about the posse chasing the dead man. You've got the cool killer, the chatterbox and the token minority. It certainly doesn't play out the way you would think. The outlandish Indian who thinks Johnny Depp is a famous poet is inspired. And you also have a nice cameo by Robert Mitchum, in his last screen appearance. Depp is great as usual. If you like Jarmusch, you'll like Dean Man. If you are new to his style you will have to get use to it."
5,"The ""2001"" of the Western genre","Dead Man is the best film by Jim Jarmusch. If you have no tollerance for artsy drawn out metaphors then stay clear of this indie masterpiece. The first time I rented this film, I watched it twice in a row. It is one of the most utterly captivating films I have ever seen. Photographed brilliantly in black and white across the western US, this film takes you on a journey through a surrealistc landscape filled with bizzare characters. Its complete vision is more of a tone poem - a meditation on superficially anomalous diversions of thought. If you can have a little patience and an open mind, you will find incredible beauty here. A special nod to Lance Henricksen, who has given one of his finest performances; and to Neil Young for his incredible score that juxtaposes electric grunge with a simple western theme, affectively merging image and music into the totemic and iconic realm of 2001: A Space Odyssey."
5,Dead Man,"Neil Young's haunting music creates the mood in this movie. A man's quest for a better life turns to havoc once he his train ride reaches the town of Machine ""the end of the line"". Johnny Depp is marvelous!"
5,Not your typical movie,"Dead Man is a one of the best movies on the market today. There are few movies I would watch more than once but ""Dead Man"" is one I will never tire of seeing. The first time I saw it, I wasn't too impressed, but the beauty and strangness of the film stayed in the back of my mind. I saw it again and the film seemed to come together in a much clearer light. I enjoy this movie more with each viewing, Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer are a riot. The sountrack by Neil Young adds a mystical illusion to the film. If you see this movie and don't like it, see it agan."
5,One of the better films ever made,"All other reviews that are written about this movie that give it low ratings have no grasp on reality. This movie is DEEP. The battle of good vs evil, the irony of the protagonist being named Willam Blake. The reflections on William Blakes poetry and lifestyle. The rhetoric on religion and what is ahead in the afterlife. It is a masterful piece of film, but only if you truly understand all that is referd to and referenced in this movie. Some are born to endless night. Some are born to sweet delight. It is easy as that."
2,"Love Jim Jarmusch, HATED this movie","Mystery Train, Ghost Dog great films. This one, Couldn't sit through it. Self-aware garbage."
1,not what I had expected,I love Johnny Depp and that is the reason for buying this movie but I didn't care for this one. It was to boring for me.
1,"If you are a Johnny fan, please put this movie back down and walk away slowly!!!","Let's just say the only reason this movie got one star from me is because you have to at least give one star to do a review!!!!If you are interested in watching this movie because you are a Johnny fan and want to see all the movies he has done. PLEASE!!! Spare your eyes the pain!!!The whole entire movie was boring. I kept going with it, trying to suffer through it, hoping it would get better. Maybe once in a while I would press fastforward to get to a (hopefully) more interesting part.BUT.... It wasn't until I got to the part where a cowboy was picking meat off human arm with his teeth that I pushed the stop button!!! I nearly barfed myself!!! And would have if it wasn't so unrealstic!!! (I'm cringing just thinking about it now and it's been three or four years since I've attempted to watch it)...Unless these types of movies are your thing I suggest you move on to the next Johnny flick if you are a fan of his."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"I stumbled across this movie in a video store a few years ago and decided to try it out for lack of anything better. What a pleasant surprise. Folks seem to either like it or hate it, but most love it. My wife and I both consider it a true classic -- one of the best either of us has ever seen."
3,bizarre,"strange, dark and bizarre. i liked the parts where the action picked up, but those segments were spaced a little too far off. the indian's speach just added a little mystery to the story, because i was trying to figure out what he meant and whether or not those fragments of speach were going to mean anything for later. like i seen on many other reviews, this story is confusing because it doesn't really show what the plot is other than william blake wandering aimlessly and he runs into various strange characters who are all out to kill him. i liked the fact that the plot was hidden. i had no idea which way the story was going to turn. there was a couple of parts that caught me off guard such as the part where cole wilson just finished off his companion's arm. mmmm...tasty. overall if you want to watch something totally unusual and somewhat original then give this a try. if you like the typical hollywood movie, then pass this by."
4,Dead Man,"This is a very strange movie, but I LOVE Johnny Depp and it was right up his actor alley. I'd give it 4 stars because he did a great job and he only acts in films he reallly wants to."
5,A film for poets,This is a greatly underrated film by most. It is a wonderful film full of visual and audio poetry which is accented by Depp's acting ability and charming good looks.
3,better like Depp,"An interesting flick, more so if you like Depp, but even if you don't it is still fairly well done, a few slow parts but worth buying."
1,Tiresome nonsense,"How the people who made this silly, meaningless mess must be laughing imagining all the pseudo intellectuals pounding their bosoms and wringing their hands as they read deep, arcane meanings into what can only be a cynical joke on the audience. Boring to the point of being comatose, this cinematic version of a child's finger painting is, in my opinion, nothing more than a put on, a joke to see how well otherwise intelligent movie goers can be diddled into thinking they're experiencing something cosmically meaningful. As far as I'm concerned, you could learn more from a Wiley Coyote cartoon.One star for this tripe because there's nothing lower."
2,DEAD MAN BARELY LIVES.,"I THINK JOHNNY DEPP IS A GREAT ACTOR AND I RESPECT HIS ANTI-HOLLYWOOD PHILOSOPHY, BUT THIS MOVIE JUST BARELY TICKS. IT IS A CONTEMPORARY BLACK AND WHITE, ROCK AND ROLL ALMOST WESTERN.THE LUDICROUS STORY FOLLOWS THE EXPLOITS OF A BEWILDRED ACCOUNTANT WILLIAM BLAKE (DEPP) WHO ACCIDENTALLY BECOMES A NOTORIOUS GUNFIGHTER. HE ENCOUNTERS VARIOUS WEIRDOS ON HIS ILIAD TYPE JOURNEY THROUGH THE WEST. HE IS SEMI RESCUED BY A NUEROTIC INDIAN WHO IS HUMUROUS AT FIRST AND THEN JUST SILLY.ROBERT MITCHUM IS ONE BRIGHT SPOT IN THIS UNSTRUNG FILM. ANOTHER IS BILLY BOB THORNTON WHO PLAYS A 'BEEN ALONE TOO LONG IN THE WILDERNESS' PSYCHOTIC HILLBILLY.DEPP ALSO DOES HIS PART BUT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO IN A SEEMINGLY DRUG INDUCED HAZE OF A FILM.TAKE A PASS ON THIS ONE IF YOU LIKE YOUR MOVIES TO MAKE SENSE.THIS DOG JUST DONT HUNT."
1,yeech!!,"even though tim keough makes a couple of errors on his review, he pretty much hit it on the mark as far as the overall film experience goes. this movie is a mess. it's confusing, and bizarre, and just plain dumb. i enjoy that johnny depp likes to take chances and do ""out there"" cinema, but he really needs to be careful in choosing his projects. it's films like this and ""fear and loathing in las vegas"" that could effectively ruin a career."
1,No Rhyme Or Reason To This Bilge,"DEAD MAN -- so screamingly stupid...so head-scratchingly pointless...so tormentingly insipid, I can hardly bear to waste further time summoning my precious powers of sarcasm to pan this bomb.If you absolutely insist on suffering through this dreadful bore, make certain the fast-forward on your remote control is up to snuff. And, above all, do not neglect to stuff your ears with sufficient cotton to drown out Neil Young's monotonously repeated (""gong-like"") guitar strumming. Whatever little dialogue you're likely to miss in the process is sure to be a blessing."
5,Jarmusch digs Depp with Dead Man,"A little different than your normal western, but with the dreamy soundtrack and visuals, Jarmusch gives you another perspective to the old west. With a cast of characters that really seem to be from the 1800's, Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thorton, Steve Buscemi, and Gary Farmer. The stark reality and crispness of an era unknown to most of us, is enhanced with the film being shot in black & white. With Neil Young creating an eery soundtrack, this movie rates as ""One of My Fav's"". Rent it before you buy it, but know it's one you'll want in your collection, so buy it now."
4,The Divine Comedy,This movie has great similarity to the poem 'The Divine Comedy' by Dante as you see the main character William Blake assisted by an exiled man named Nobody as he seemingly travels through hell becoming a man his original self would never have recognized. This movie is a dark comedy that I believe everybody should see at least once in their life.
4,I *need* to see this again. Maybe it'll get one more star.,"Let me put it this way: there are two men who could possibly direct a film version of Cormac McCarthy's _Blood Meridian_. One is Sam Peckinpah. The other is Jim Jarmusch, whose oddly calm and surreal approach to violence, while the complete opposite of Peckinpah's, nonetheless creates a West very much in line with McCarthy's, in my opinion. Worth a viewing, and will at least leave you wondering, like ""Ghost Dog,"" what exactly was it you just watched?"
4,Dead Man,"This is a great film that makes fun of the ideology, including gender roles and other false stereotypes."
1,Dead Man is deadly disappointing,"What movie did the reviewers watch? It certainly wasn't the farce that played on my TV. I'm an admirer of mostof Johnny Depp's films but this stinker will be consigned to my ""Never to be watched again"" pile. How did anaccountant from Cleavland who never fired a gun before become such a crack shot with no practice or training?When did he reload his six-shooter and where did he get the bullets? I counted at least 8 or 9 shots withoutany new ammo. The story was so full of holes and unbelievable events that I thought it was a comedy, maybe itwas and that is why it stunk so bad as a drama....."
1,"Dead Man, Dead Movie","This incomprensible and boring collections of what appear to be extemperaneous skits is very difficult to watch.The movie has many good people including my favorite actors, Johnny Depp and Robert Mitchum. I was looking for darkness but found stupifing boredom. None of us were able to watch the whole movie."
1,Not good art - a 1 to 2 star movie at best,"It just goes to show, just because you film a movie in black and white, doesn't make it art. This movie was really only consisted of a bunch of in-jokes regarding the Old West. They even go as far a naming a character after a member of Tom Petty & and Heartbreaker's band. Gimme a break! It certainly can't be called ""revisionist"", more of a attempted parody. Unfortunately, the bulk of the film falls flat. Guess what? Putting Iggy Pop in a dress isn't particularly funny or interesting. Neither is showing Lance Henriksen's culinary habits. Johnny Depp gives about the same low-key performance that he gives in all his other films, it doesn't work in this movie since nothing else in the movie is particularly interesting. I did like the Native American character of Nobody though."
1,Worst junk since,"...and even though Legends of the fall had the same idiotic ""O' Great Eagle spirit"" mumbo jumbo mysticism at least it wasn't so obnoxiously artsy.If this movie had come out,say 1968 or so, It would have been looked upon as ""Revisionist history"" or a ""brilliant re-use of a traditional American art form to present a bold counter-cultural statement"" a ""Re-definition of the genre"" As it is,this bloatedly pretentious garbage is about 30 years too late.""Nobody"" was about as convincing as a Native American as Alan Hale would have been in a Cher wig.The violence was gratuitous as well as the humor (which wasn't nearly as funny as I suspect the director thought it was).Don't waste your time with this self indulgent junk...The only way this bomb is ""Heavily symbolic"" if the director was attempting to symbolize equal parts vanity,pretense and stupidity."
2,Surreal and just short of satisfying.,"Dead Man is dreamlike. Filmed in a rich, textured monochrome, the movie follows a young accountant who leaves Cleveland, Ohio for a job in a remote frontier town in the Pacific Northwest. The defining cinematic technique involves presenting the story in short snippets -- chapters varying in length that fade quickly to black. But while Dead Man captures the feeling of a dream, and is chock full of symbols of various kinds, it doesn't really work as much more than an hallucinatory trip of sorts, and its attempt to tell a greater story -- the path from life to death to afterlife -- ends up being more odd and pretentious than artistic. It has the feel of someone trying too hard to be profound and quirky. It left me empty and only slightly engaged."
5,Movie Mars comes through!,"Worried about buying it at such a low price, but the movie arrived quickly and with no problems. And it is one of the funniest, saddest movies I've seen in a long time. Thought provoking at the very least"
5,Haunting...,"That's the only way to describe this movie. From the opening sequence to the very end, I was mesmerized, unable to look away from the screen. Even though I was watching it in a slightly crowded room on a 13"" screen, I was riveted. At the end, I convinced my host to rewind it and play it again. The imagery evoked in the movie is awesome and the casting and characters are perfect. As far as I'm concerned, this is Depp's best work to date. The best part of this movie though is that you can watch it again and see something new - not some wierd detail like Sixth Sense, but something actually new, that you just missed. My only regret is that I can't find it on DVD."
2,What language,I bought this as a gift. Now I find out it is in French with subtitles. That should have been more clear-
4,meaning?,"If you're looking for ""meaning"" in everything, this has nothing, but has it all in the same breath. I walked away wondering, questioning, thinking. This is one of the most interesting flicks that I have seen. I would like to think that it stretched my boundaries in thinking about death and life. I would have given it a 5 if it weren't for the quirkiness and distractions that sometime come through. Loved Depp, loved Iggy in the cameo. Neil Young's soundtrack was incredible, though it seemed a bit repetitive to me. That said, I'm going to buy it and put it on my shuffle."
4,Wow!! I'm still deciding.,"This movie is odd---like Kill Bill and like artsy martial art movies----and reminds me of them a lot---even has similar music. But this was made before Kill Bill. It has a lot of dry/odd humor. I found myself laughing often and at things that shouldn't be funny but are in this film. Old Brother Where Are thou?--reminds me of this film as well---because of the odd humor, odd circumstances and odyssey William Blake (Johnny Depp's character)goes on. This is a movie you have to watch when the house is quiet, with no interruptions and awake. I truly enjoyed it."
3,Moody,"I found this movie a little more mysterious than I think it intended to be. Johnny Depp is strangely flat, and some of the plot points went past me. But the black and white cinematography is never less than striking, particularly a scene of Depp and his Indian cohort riding pinto ponies through a forest of ferns."
5,.,"So great! So interesting and literary. Dead Man brushes up against so many topics-- death, dreams, religion, cannibalism, the function of film, all kinds of that good and tasty stuff. It's a very biting satire of the old west. This movie puts the fantasy of the pioneer outdoorsman to death. but at the same time that the movie makes fun of the old legends, there is something weirdly mythic about William Blake and Nobody's journey through the woods that makes you really get into it. It's a slow movie, no car chases, just one long, unhurried pony chase. But the soundtrack is unnerving and makes things seem more urgent. I held my breath. Johnny Depp is very good looking as well."
3,"Watch: +, 1-day delivery: -","The purchased item was okay. However, I ordered it on a Thursday (early afternoon) and paid the 1-day delivery. I expected the item to arrive no later than Sarturday and they delivered it the following Monday ... very disappointing! It is NOT worth paying for the 1-day delivery."
2,Depends on taste,"I didn't notice in the review the details about the length of the band. The band wraps twice around your wrist before fastening. It made it a bit difficult to wear, so I ended with returning it. The quality of the band and this face didn't seem equal with the price, it seemed like it would get roughed up sorta quick. But it was cute, I would purchase it for a cheaper price, say under $40, for instance."
2,Very disappointing!,"This plot had such potential...which it sadly failed to realize.The main character was overly complex, while other important characters were not fully developed. The motivations were farfetched at best and if you like an ending that even slightly balances the universe, look elsewhere. I was actually angry at the way this book ended. I am an avid reader, but I can count the number of times I've been angry with a story. This will be a memorable book simply for that reason."
4,A Compassionate and Moving Biography,"I want to say I enjoyed this book, but that is not to say I enjoyed the misery that was the life of Richard Yates. After finishing this book, I was shocked to see that both the New York and Brooklyn libraries offered none of his books for borrowing.There is one line I remember with amusement and sorrow from this biography. After Richard Yates tosses back a bunch of pills and finishes them off with a swig of hard liquor, he looks at his child and acknowledges, ""This is what keeps your old daddy in business.""I laughed and I cried. Siouxie, Brooklyn"
5,Wow!,"This is the best biography of a writer I've read since the Shirley Jackson biography ""Private Demons"". I agree with the previous poster who said that this should be a National Book Award nominee/winner."
5,Masterpiece,This book is a masterpierce. I can scarcely comprehend the monomania that must have impelled Mr. Bailey to write such a meticulous and perceptive book.
2,bad color,"Returned this item because I ordered the color was much different than I was expecting. I thought the ""cloud"" color was a bright white (like the previous one that I had that was the exact same model/make/ year) but the color turned out to be yellowish white, almost the color of urine (gross!). So I returned it immediately and will order the other ""white"" color... hopefully it will turn out better and like my previous jacket."
1,Bamboozled,"I feel really bamboozled by this plastic feeling jacket. Not only was it expensive, I still got wet with this jacket on. To make matters worse, there is not easy way to neatly fold the jacket in the pocket. So when opening it up, you have one wrinkled mess. The outer shell is so thin, that it feels like you are wearing a noisy plastic bag. I would suggest finding cheaper jackets are are more waterproof than this."
5,"Nice, light rain jacket","Here in Morro Bay we get a lot of moderate and overcast weather. Once you acclimate to the nearly constant 63 degree weather it feels warm. It's nice to have a light jacket that doesn't warm you but keeps the damp off. I wear this jacket to kayak. It's perfect. It's also very attractive and well built. I love the loose fit at the bottom. It was shipped fast, too."
3,Pricey,"The jacket looked great. It wasn't too fitted but it looked good on. Had room to put a sweater under. I didn't like that it made swishing sounds (like a plastic bag) when I moved, but I guess that's what you get for it being perfectly waterproof.I ended up returning it though because I happened to find the exact same style of jacket without the brand name (lightweight, 100% waterproof, fits into its own pocket) at Winners. At Winners it was on sale for $30 rather than $80. I couldn't care less for brand names so I went with the Winners one."
3,Bound4nh,"I purchased a Marmot rain jacket years ago and loved it but when I recently caught it on something and tore a small hole in it, I decided to treat myself to a new one. I was a bit disappointed with the material...it seems much stiffer and ""crackly"" noise wise than my original and, therefore, doesn't wear as easily. I feel like I'm always straightening it out especially when I first put it on. I'm hoping with more wear it will soften."
5,AWESOME !,So pleased with my Marmot raincoat it is a perfect weight ! Packs nicely for travel and looks great! I bought one size larger as advised and im glad I did they run small. Shipping was super fast too and I was glad it came on a rainy day !
5,Marmot Jacket,I really like this jacket. It's the perfect outer layer to keep the wind out when I'm outside in the rainy spring weather.
2,pretty but huge,"I really wish i had not taken the advice from the reviews to order a size up. The jacket is very pretty, i ordered a small in green envy and the color and quality of detail is really nice. It is really noisy however, and the fact that it engulfs me makes that worse. I would normally have ordered an extra small, and that would have been better. The frustration comes because the jacket is quite roomy everywhere but the shoulders , which means to return for an extra small would be prioritizing aesthetic alone, since mobility and therefore functionality would be impaired.I make my decisions to purchase items online carefully reading all available reviews and product details thoroughly.I am 5'2, 110 lbs. If this jacket fit me like a small I would be satisfied even though i was hoping fora xs fit, but instead it feels a bit bigger than a medium."
4,Keeps the Rain Out,I bought this jacket after returning from a hiking trip where almost everyone had a Marmot rain jacket. I got wet on a hike in a downpour. Those with Marmots did not. I'm wearing it now to walk my dog on rainy days and so far I'm dry. My only complaint is that it could be a little longer. I'm 5'4'' and it it comes just below my hips. I think just below the butt would be better.
4,"Great Raincoat, But Runs Small","I love this raincoat, very simple with all of the expected features of a good name brand jacket. I love the bright red color. My only warning is that it runs small. I am typically a medium or large, so I initially ordered large to be safe and ended up needing to exchange for an XL - making it the only XL item I own."
2,"Thin, Beautiful, and Fragile","My Krazr developed a hairline crack across the front mirror two months after purchase. No abuse, just use. I have a feeling that my phone is not unique and that this is pretty clear evidence of a defective phone, if not a design flaw.Verizon, of course, has been absolutely useless if not downright unhelpful. I have insurance, but there is a fifty dollar deductible. This seems crazy for what must be a $5 part. Naturally, they won't sell me the replacement part-- they want me to buy a new phone. So I will wait until it develops other problems, which seems likely at this point, before I file my claim.Otherwise I like the phone. I just don't expect it to last very long."
4,Moto krzr k1m (Verizon),"The KRZR K1m is a very nice phone. Call quality is oustanding. Visual appearance is great. All that other stuff is pure fluff, if you want to hear music get a mp3 player and if you want better digital photos get a nice digital camera. I'm a photographer and the photos that are taken with the cell phone's camera are terrible and this is for all brands. I have never seen any photos that have been taken by these things that are worth printing. I am a long time Motorola phone user and I have been pleased with the quality of build and function so I stay with Motorola. My wife and children had LG's, but they would drop calls often, so I will not be getting any LG products anytime soon for me. I would rate the phone 5 stars, but Verizon has convinced Motorola to dumb the phone down. By the way, the phone was free or else I would gotten the W835, which my wife loves."
2,Terrible Phone...,"I decided to switch from Sprint to AT&T;, specifically to get access to this phone. I was drawn to the small, thin size of the phone and the flashy blue color. Before I bought it, I read all the reviews and found that it was much better than the RAZR... or so I thought!I have had this phone for a little over a year! I hate it! I can barely hear people, as the sound is muffled through the phone. Noone can hear me when I use the bluetooth feature through my car. The front of the phone is already cracked just from normal use - I have not dropped it, although sometimes I want to out of frustration. In addition, the phone freezes from time to time and I cannot receive incoming calls. And probably the biggest issue is that I consistently get dropped calls! This happens even when I am speaking with another AT&T; network user. It is ridiculous. If I didn't have this contract for another 11 months, I would definitely switch!!!!"
2,"Good enough, while it still works","PRO:1 - decent battery life, while it works2 - small3 - good enough bluetoothCON:1 - battery issues2 - quality of connections3 - difficult to feel the keys (i.e., to call without looking at the keypad)This phone was great for about 13-14 months when it started having severe problems. The connection cuts in and out frequently. The location is not wholly to blame, as I've compared calling from my krzr with calling from my girlfriend's samsung (she is also with verizon) and hers does not suffer this problem.Furthermore, the battery did not last much longer than a year. At one point I had less than 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge, although I have since swapped batteries with my mom who barely uses her phone at all.I can't comment much on the quality of the camera or mp3 playing features of the phone as I have not been interested in them, other than to say that the camera takes a very long time to turn on and is sufficiently cumbersome to use."
3,Nice style but short battery life,"It's a great phone, have a good reception, but I just disappointed with the battery. Short battery life. I have to recharge it every other day, eventhough I don't use it that much."
2,Looks can be deceiving with this phone...,"I got this phone...well actually two, one for me and one for my girlfriend, and BOTH experience the same problems; short battery life like everyone says, the phone freezes at random times FREQUENTLY especially when trying to send a message and then you got to take the battery out and turn it back on, frequently will say ""failed delivery"" while sending a text even when you have a good connection, it randomly shuts off every couple days. I took both phones in for repair and explained what was wrong with them and they still have the same problems.Basically the only thing good is I've never had a dropped call yet, but a lot of times it's hard to place a call too even when you have the full 8 bars. So anyway, if I were you I'd get the LG Envy instead. I wish I did."
2,"Can you hear me, Motorola?","Sucks big time! I live in a complex where there are no signals from Cingular and T-mobile. My niece has an old beat-up phone and gets pretty solid signal everywhere in my complex so I thought I should switch to Verizon. Well, KRZR K1m has ridiculously poor signal compared to my niece's out-of-date phone. Why Motorola? Why designed a nice looking phone with poor reception? Motorola must have a bunch of brainless R&D folks there except those make-up artists. How could you ask consumers to support Motorola?"
2,*Looks* pretty. That's about it.,"Completely agree with SirJOW. Verizon has completely emasculated this phone. This would get one star if it weren't for the fact that it does look really nice--the one thing Verizon couldn't screw up, but they probably tried.I hate that I can't customize the buttons like the old V710 or even V300. And the stupid red banners (thanks Verizon) framing the top and bottom of the screen appear to be a permanent fixture.Blah. Not what I expected from what I thought was a top-of-the-line phone."
1,krzr k1m,i have two of these phones this is the worst phone i have ever owned my daughter's mirror broke and it does not work at all. my phone had to be replace because of the software not working. i payed for my daughter's and got mine free. what a joke . i always loved motorola phones they should recall this phone it is junk.
2,Phone is Great...Verizon Sucks!!!,"This review is more for the service than the phone, the phone is amazing but the carrier is terrible. I have switched from T-Mobile to Verizon and they have by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was disconnected from customer service during transferred calls multiple times, I was called back at a later date at 7:30am because that call center is on the East Coast and the wanted me to take a survey of how I was helped. The phone is locked and owned by VERIZON NOT YOU!! You cannot cannot change the Menu Options and you have to pay for everything directly through Verizon, it will not let you upload your own ringtones! If you are looking for a phone go through Cingular they have far better service. Verizon Blows!!!"
4,a great looking phone but one flaw,"First I should say I do not own this phone. I almost bought it but I am very particular about design and found that when closed the plastic top shell cover takes any finger marks when you touch it, it does not matter how dry your hands are. They had two KRZR for show in the verizon store and only these two phones had huge marks all over which I really noticed immediately. Ok it's nothing you will say. Yes but enough for me not to buy it. Nobody mentionned this sofar."
3,freak of nature?,"i never used to believe people who say their phones break spontaneously..but then mine did. i had this phone for about a week and a half. while i was talking one day, i heard a *pop* and the screen went black. dead. nothing. boo. according to the tech at the store, the battery exploded. freak of nature or is this thing an energy whore? i ran out of battery every two days and i am not even a hard core user.that aside..it is pretty, but the menus are a big fat pain in the but."
1,Horrible,"First off I have to say it's not really the phone, it's Verizons setup that makes me want to throw it at the wall. Everything about this phone is the worst.From the longest method to send a text to the not being able to use the music files you just put in as a ringtone.Probably the most annoying is if you miss a call, it beeps loudly every minute. So if your half asleep and you have a missed call you can be sure it will let you know. If you plan on getting this phone just don't get it with Verizon!"
1,worst phone ever.,"This is the worst phone I've ever bought. Please, continue your phone search before you buy this one. Besides the fact that the ringer and vibrator don't work at random times, the applications are so ridiculously annoying to get to. In my old motorolla the applications, such as text messages, were much quicker and easier to use. In addition, the alarm clock feature, which I use daily- is riDICulous. First of all, you can't change the volume. Second of all, if you are sleepy and hit the side of the phone the alarm will stop but the snooze does not kick in. In other cell phones, snooze automatically kicks in unless you open the phone and turn the alarm off. Lastly, the mirror front, while it has come in useful from time to time when I forgot my compact mirror, is not a good phone cover. Finger prints get on it obviously and the phone always looks dirty.This phone...sucks."
1,not impressed...,"I consider myself a pretty big fan of the Real World, but I wasn't impressed with this video. I thought that it would have a variety of clips from the different seasons and feature a variety of cast members. Instead the producers decided to go really indepth into four particular fights. The most entertaining fight featured on the video was Dan and Melissa's Real World Miami fight because when they had Dan watch the video with Nathan and Flora he made comments like ""Oh - look at me. I was such a drama queen."" But the other ""fights"" like Irene and Stephen's battle in Seattle and Tami and David's LA blanket incident had already been re-hashed so many times on the show that I just didn't care about hearing them talk about it AGAIN.My recommendation - save your money and just watch re-runs of the show on MTV instead."
4,I love this tape!!!I wish they'd release more like it!!,"I know that Sony doesn't make new copies of this tape.I don't even know if a DVD was released for it.I highly recommend it has the four biggest fights of the first 7 seasons uncut and 100% uncensored.The Beth/Tami/David Los Angeles fight was the longest.It runs for about 17 minutes sometimes with 2 cameras showing on the screen to show what everyone was doing.Stephen/Irene(The slap heard around the world,Seattle):An infamous slap towards slap is exchanged between a mail cast member and female cast memberDan/Melissa(Miami):A nasty expletive-filled yelling match between 2 Miami Cast membersBeth/Tami/David(Los Angeles):The infamous blanket pull argument uncut and uncensoredPuck/Pedro(San Francisco):The argument between Puck And pedro that sent Puck Packing"
4,works good,"I purchased this sd card reader because my card reader on my laptop quit working. This card reader works pretty good but sometimes when I first put in my computer does not recognize it, I have to try a couple of times to get it to work. But once connected it is great and works perfectly. I only gave this four stars because of my computer not recognising it sometimes. Please note this may be because my laptop is getting old and may have nothing to do with the reader. If I had another computer I would test it but I don't. I would recomend this to anyone."
4,"Great product, low price, but wrong color...","I received this item a few days ago. Cost about $3 out the door. I never knew these items could be so cheap.Anyway, I connected this to my Windows XP (SP3) laptop, Windows recognized the device right away. It worked great! I was even able to use Eraser (permanent deletion program) on the SD card without any problems.The reason I'm only giving this 4 stars is because the product came-in blue rather than the advertised charcoal color. I know, that's not a big deal, but I can't give a perfect score if everything was not perfect. Besides, I chose this particular item over other because of the color."
4,Good value,"This reader is versatile and very cost-effective! I have used this for over a year now with no problems, but the construction quality is a little cheap."
3,Card Reader,"This product wasn't what I expected. It's called a 10-in-1 card reader, but apparently all it reads are sd and sd based cards (won't read pro duo flash cards, xd picture cards, etc.). The title is a little misleading. For what it does do....it does it well."
4,"It works and it's low cost, but it is as wide as an SD card","The product works, the price was low, and it came fast. It's a simple, convenient design with a cover. It doesn't get much better. Just one warning: If you have a computer like my MacBook that has the two USB ports right next to each other horizontally, you might not be able plug both in at the same time because the unit is as wide as an SD card, which means it covers the second slot when inserted in the first."
1,Product does not work,Bought this for use with a Raspberry Pi. The device fails to read properly formatted SD Cards and write attempts result in corruption. Tested under Windows 7 and Debian Linux 6.0. Buy the IOGear instead.
3,"Cheaply made, but",I didn't pay much for it. The cap is loose and it doesn't fit very tightly in my UBS port on my computer. But it will do what it is supposed to do. I use it to transfer apps and docs from my computer to a memory card for my phone or tablet.
1,Piece of crud,Would not read cards or not work on some devices. Metal USB part fell off after a few uses. Too scared it may mess up my SD cards. Too cheap to return and too lazy too mess with it.
2,OK at first.,"Doesn't appear to work any more. Didn't mind the large size and cheapish ""feel"". If it was still working. Price was right-and probably not worth my time to try to get any money back. So I guess it was worth a few bucks to have it for a while-kinda like renting it. I'm guessing not all readers will fail like mine so, hey, if you feel lucky, buy one.."
4,Works great but . . .,works great but the plasic that it is made with is brital the cap that covers the card that you insert broke a day after i got it butit works great I'll keep it
1,Does not read minisd without an sd adapter,Very misleading title. Would not recommend to anyone. It does work with adapters however it does not come with any.
4,serve the purpose,"Really doing good job for this price. I used with HCSD and Micro SD...all just working fine..really like it. Low quality plastic, but that is expected for this price."
5,Great card reader,"This card reader works great every time!! If you are looking for a good SD Card Reader, pick this one. It is FAST and dependable."
2,Cheap is a Pro and Con,"I've ordered readers like this before, but this particular one seems to be MUCH flimsier than those. I ordered two of these knowing that they break easily.The first one kept switching between readable and unreadable, as though someone was wiggling it but it wasn't touched. After a week of this, I handed it to a friend to go get the other one. As soon as he took it, it shattered into 10 pieces. The second one is starting to act funny too and its only a matter of time before it breaks. Given, these are extremely cheap, but that's just it. You can find another one like this for the same price if not cheaper that is sturdier than this."
5,USB reader,It works and its cheap. What more is there to ask for. Great for portability. Not much to complain about.
3,Laura Mercier thickening mascara,"Yes, I love this mascara as a thickening mascara. It looks nice when applied carefully. The downside - it is nearly impossible to wash off and smears all over your eyes whether using a facial wash to remove it or a makeup remover to take it off. If this wasn't such an issue I'd stick with this mascara however I've decided to try Blinc Kiss me Mascara and I'll let you know what I think soon!"
3,rather do not buy it,"I am disappointed overall with the product. Yes, I agree that this mascara makes lashes thicker and longer. Unfortunately it does not stick with lashes for whole day but tints skin and makes dark circles beneath eyes.I think that this product is too expensive for failure like that."
2,shipping,I do not know about the product itself because it was a gift but I was very concerned that the item cost $20.00 and the shipping was $15.50. I feel the item could have been shipped in a smaller and more effective method. I will think twice about ordering again due to the feeling I was taken advantage of.
1,Couldn't even watch it...,"I realized in the first song that for some reason the DVD doesn't include most of the live audio. The ""live"" trombones aren't heard, the ""live"" chorus sounds suspiciously synthesized, the ""live"" drums don't synch with what the drummer is playing... I assume the producers burned the DVD with the reference tracks the performers were listening to in their earpieces during the concert, so it synchs, but it sounds like a studio recording.Then when Jarre starts playing the ""laser organ"" it becomes apparent that they're just lasers ... no sensors, no musical instrument attached.So generally, I think it's a studio recording with some live talking and cheering mixed in, and a lot of staging that doesn't translate very well to video. After the first two songs I watched the rest of it on 5x and 10x fast forward."
5,Jean Michel Jarre - Oxygene Moscow,Great documentation of Jarre and his band LIVE in Moscow. Gives a good idea of the enormity and extravagant elegance of a Jarre concert. High recommendation if you like JMJ.
3,Well done presentation,"Jean Michel Jarre's DVD for Oxygene Moscow was well made, and aimed at a young audience with many special effects for his music.Your service in sending the DVD was excellent. We received it here in Brazil in perfect shape."
3,Moscow????.......Paris For Tolerance is Best!!,"I bought this DVD back in May 2000, and it became the first one in my actual collection. I have to say that i am a SUPER FAN of JMJ since 1981 when i listened to a ""Oxigene"" Dreyfuss Tape, but this DVD doesn't capture the real essence and excitement of a JMJ concert...That's why i give it 3 stars, just for the music, not for the production. Hey, Mr. Jarre, Where's the ""Concert for Tolerance"", I have it on a VHS tape, i recorded from HBO back in 1996...This is the BEST CONCERT EVER!!...I Know it is available only in Laserdisc and in PAL system!!"
4,spectacular!,"A great concert of electronic genius.With 3 additional keyboard players and 2 drummers this has a magic musical chemistry. It is a band not a DJ. Stunning visuals with murals,giant puppets and a fireworks display that must have cost zillions. Great to see a Hammond B3 organ on stage alongside hi tech synths. The highlight would have to be the hit Oxygene 4 which goes off!!"
1,The most expensive pair of PJ pants ever,"This is a pair of cheaply-made pants. The rosso design is not flattering at all, maybe only on a mannequin. Nobody should wear this outside the house. I've seen pajama pants from Walmart that looks better at a fraction of its price. This must be either a knockoff or Miu Miu just slapped its label on a pair of $5 pjs from a discount retailer."
5,Awesome speaker wire for outdoor use,I purchased this for direct burial on an outdoor sound system with JBL speakers. The quality is great and the price was even better.
5,The Fire Marshal wanted to know where I got the Outlet Strip,"I have a retail store in an older strip mall. During a recent inspection by the Fire Marshal, I was instructed to remove the 4ft. power strips that were plugged into each other (to make an extension cord) and hire an electrician to run wiring to the computer/cash register. Since the violation was for piggy-backing the power strips I purchased two of these power strips (for different locations in the store). Now I have only one power strip plugged into the outlet, have a 15ft. cord that reaches to the computer table, and had 24 outlets. Saved the cost of the electrician, and passed the re-inspection without a problem!!!!!!!! The Fire Marshal's comment - where did you find this power outlet - I have never seen one this long. (PS - it did meet code!)"
5,"Well built, perhaps too many outlets","The unit is very well built, and has an outlet every few inches. This is probably too many outlets, but I'm not complaining!"
3,Super adequate,This product neither over preformed nor under performed. It was just right. It is exactly as described and there are no amazing or disappointing things about it. Its a multiple outlet strip that has multiple outlets on it... what else is there really?
4,Good introduction to chaos theory in Biology,"This book is a good introduction for those who would like to learn more about how the rythms of the different processes in our organism work. It requires a good knowledge of mathematics (calculus) but has many examples described in pure text.The analysis focuses mainly in the systemic cycles (heart beat, breathing, etc.) but the same theory can be used to gene regulation and enzime activities.At the end of the book there's an appendix with some basic notions of the math used through out the book but it'll be useful only for those who have some knowledge of calculus."
1,does not work,it does not play on my dvd player it does not work at all thats bad it is worthless nouse for me
1,THE WORST ERNEST MOVIE OF THEM ALL,"ERNEST [JIM VARNEY], WHO'S NOW A JANITOR AT A HIGH SCHOOL, IS FORCED TO GO THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AGAIN TO GET HIS DIPLOMA. THIS WAS TOTALLY UNFUNNY AND HORRIBLY BAD. THIS IS UNENDURABLE. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST OF THE ERNEST SERIES AND THIS MOVIE AIN'T EVEN WORTH OWNING, LET ALONE WATCHING. ONLY PURE ERNEST DIE-HARDS WILL ENJOY THIS ONE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO LAUGH A LOT, THIS MOVIE SURELY WON'T HELP YOU DO IT! FOLLOWED BY SLAM DUNK ERNEST."
4,Excellent Unicycle,"My son loves this unicycle, can not get him off it, much better than a video game. Best Christmas gift ever."
2,WAY TO MANY QUESTIONS,The book was ok but I didn't agree whith their stratagy. it was allways stupid attacking without a stratagy at all. Lisa wasn't aggresive enough. She needs to enlarge her army. She wouldn't have stood a chance against the general but it was funny when lisa punched him in the nose. Lisa and the chedester gang should join forces. Tom was aggresive and lisa was good at making strategies
5,WHAT!? NO SEQUEL?,"A review, but first! Allow me to repeat myself: What!? No sequel?This book shows people what could really happen if a plague like this would actually sweep the countryside. I absolutely adore the fact that it has to do with children, not adults in a summary like: An asteroid hits earth, leaving us as cavemen once again, where strength rules all (and adults beat on kids once again) This story shows so much thought and intelligence, it IS true that if you really put your mind to it, it may actually work. And it IS true that this could all happen (not that we want it to) you remember all the details about Lisa, her brother, her militia, the King of Chicago, everything. And then comes the greatest shock of all: this was written before I was born! Arggh!This is a great edition for a personal library for children and adults alike. It doesn't take much thought to understand it. Read on! Now, excuse me while I go annoy my Dad into reading it."
4,Still A Good Story,"Despite the obvious problems in writing style and some story elements, I definitely do *not* feel that O.T. Nelson's ""The Girl Who Owned A City"" is a bad book. On the contrary, I think it's a wonderful book because it makes the reader think: how would you survive, if you were in the same situation as the children? Frankly, I believe we should look at the book as yet another way of viewing things. Yes, ten-year-old Lisa does run a dictatorship. But I think we have to acknowledge that democracy isn't the only way to run an organization.Instead of dismissing this book completely, read it and think about it. It's a story I've enjoyed for many years now, and continue to enjoy even now that I'm way over twelve."
4,Lisa's Big Step,"The Girl Who Owned a City is a really good book. However, I bet a lot of people want to know what happened to the bodies. Well, that's a question only the author would know. My class would like to see a sequel to The Girl Who Owned a City. I think the best part of the book was when Lisa stepped up and knew that she had to save herself and others from dying. What impressed me the most was when the kids learned how to drive and took food to survive. I think that every kid that reads this book would get so in to it and learn how it feels to be out in the real world. I think it's really good when the kids use their wits to steal stuff for themselves to be able to feed and keep themselves in a safe house."
4,A World With No Adults,"Man, I wish there were no grown-ups, they always mess things up. This is what many think when they get in trouble with an adult. But, what if there really were no adults? In The Girl Who Own A City, that is exactly what happens. Everyone above the age of 13 is killed by a virus. The children that survive were left with nothing, not even electricity. This is a wonderul book to read because it teaches kids how hard life would be with no adults while still taking them on a great adventure. The book also talks about leadership skills and how important it is to share. The only part of the book that I didn't agree with was the lack of information about dead bodies. Throughout the whole book there was no mention of seeing a body."
5,A Great Book for Girls,"I read this book when I was 11, and having a vivid imagination, I immediately put myself in the book as the main character. And I can honestly say that this book is what really got me into reading. The copy I own has seen better years, but it's still a favorite and I've passed it on to my 8 + 9 year old girls. They both read it and they loved it!! I ended up having to buy another copy so they both could have one. I would have to say this is one of THE BEST books for children...great story line, and great details (so it's not hard at all to imagine yourself in the story). A must buy!!"
5,A thinker's book: How a ten-year-old girl creates a government from scratch in a world without grown-ups,"The Girl Who Owned a City by O.T. Nelson. Set in the 1970's after a virus has killed off everyone over the age of 12. A 10-year-old girl becomes a leader and literally creates a new government all by herself, despite looting gangs and the objections of her own friends.Could have been boring if not for the loving relationship between the girl and her six-year-old brother, and how wondrously strong children can be, when they have to be.(Do NOT get the edited version published by First Avenue Editions in 1995-it's been dumbed down)"
3,Meh.,"Meh. It was OK. Another one of those books where the author does not really know how to think and talk like a child. The heroine in this book was bad-ass, but was like 12, and thought along the lines of a 35 year woman. Not saying kids are stupid, but it's hard to suspend your belief when kids talk like grownups and make decisions that an adult would.Cute little story, though, and could have used a sequel. I think one was planned but never happened."
3,This Book Has Negative And Positive Thoughts- Bharat,"There were some things I liked about the book and some things I didn't. I liked how this book was so detailed. This book was so interesting. I couldn't stop reading this book. I would also say that this book is a little humorous as well. Now, the bad things are that this book is a little unrealistic. For example when children get to use guns. Also when a virus wipes out people above the age of 12 and a 10-year-old girl named Lisa is the leader of the city. My final example is when kids could drive cars. But I could tell that O.T Nelson has a vast imagination. The problem is if there is too much imagination then the book gets unrealistic. Other than that I pretty much enjoyed reading this book."
3,The Book you don't want to put down... or is it???- Ravi,"This is a good book that you don't want to put down... in the beginning and middle. ""The Girl Who Owned the City"" is a great book, if you want to pass time. It is a cliff hanging book, but the ending is a little bit ironic.It is ironic because the book seems like the it lost a couple pages in the delivery. ""The Girl Who Owned the City"" seems like it stops in the end. Overall, I think this is an average book... if you want to pass time."
3,A very interesting book...- Ayushi,"I thought that this book was okay. It was sometimes VERY unique, and sometimes just very predictable. The idea of a 10-year old girl trying to find the positives of no adults around and sometimes actually succeeding, is very clever and unique. In other parts like the end was just plain predictable. When Tom Logan was about to shake hands with Lisa, he did something that was wasn't that surprising. It was sort of obvious that the end would not come by that quickly. In my opinion, the book's ""ending"" felt like the actual ending disappeared and became unknown."
3,This book has its Ups and Downs - Jennie,"This book is like getting your brand new car stolen..but then winning the ""Mega Millions,"" lottery! This book has good and bad qualities. Some examples of the good qualities in this book is the interesting sight of seeing how all the kids under twelve act when their entire life has changed in a matter of days. Their experiences and situations are very fun to read and this book has its moments were I can't even put down the book! An example from the book that shows its bad qualities is at the end. It seems like the author was trying to get the book over with, and the end just seemed empty and incomplete to me. These bad qualities made me want to stop reading this book. But overall I think it was a pretty interesting book and worthwhile reading."
1,Very Overrated Book,"Although many have said ""The Girl Who Owned a City"" is an excellent example of science fiction, it is really an overrated novel. The story goes on very slowly, hits the climax, then speeds up and stops quickly. Next, you never get any feelings from the characters throughout the whole book. Lisa, the main character, always sets her hopes to high and when they are not fulfilled she acts particularly nasty to everyone, including herself. In the end, even though it has been highly rated, the book turns out to be unrealistic and dull."
1,I did'nt like it!,"Sorry to disagree with all of you, but I didn't like it. It repeated the past 1 too many times and I lost interest. I also didn't like the fact Lisa went crazy over losing Glenbard. Basically it's a book to get a kid to work hard."
1,Avoid! Avoid!,"This book is terrible. The book repeatedly sets up grim and serious problems that are then glossed over or solved in unrealistically simple ways. Everyone older than 12 dies within a month, but nowhere is there a mention of dead bodies. Did billions of corpses just evaporate? 9- and 10-year-olds (and younger) figure out how to drive cars, pump gas, and are all big enough to reach the pedals and see out the windshield. If it was that easy, wouldn't the driving age be lower? A character gets shot by one of the marauding bullies and these kids can perform basic surgery to remove the bullet, and THEN the bullies who just SHOT SOMEONE are defeated by a simple scolding. Apparently, in this world Logic died too.Furthermore, the writing style is bland. Not bad, but bland. And apparently it was written in order to teach Ayn Rand's philosophy to little kids. Trust me, folks, there is much better post-apocalyptic YA fiction out there, including ones with female protagonists."
5,The Girl who Owned a City,The Girl Who owned a city is a great book that is about Lisa and Todd. There is a virus going around that kills everyone over the age of 12. All kids have to survive on their own. This is a story about how the kids survive and learn who the can or can't trust. They beat gangs and learn how to deal with life. This is an absolutely great book and I would reccomend it to all ages.
3,The Plague,"I believe that this book was good, yet the author doesn't answer all my questions. For instance, where did all the bodies go when the plague had swept the planet clean? Also, what happened to Logan and his gang? The book had a good story line, but it doesn't give all the information that I would like. I would like to know what's going to happen with Chicago. I wish that the author would write a sequel."
4,Lisa's Life,"I thought The Girl Who Owned The City was a really good book. There were a couple parts I liked, such as when Lisa hit the commander right in the face. She is very courageous. One part of the book that I didn't like was the author's choice to ignore the question of the dead bodies."
5,Definitely a Fantastic Book,"The Girl Who Owned A City is a book that I could make so many connections to, it's fantastic. For one thing, we live on the very lot that Lisa's house was on before it burned down. Also, my teenage daughter is going to Glenbard, and it really does resemble a castle or fortress. A really good reason that the book is fantastic is that the author used a real life town, and could use characters molded from the residents. Good job Nelson!"
4,Excellent reading,"I first read this book when i was in seventh grade. I am now 32 years old and to this day I can still remember it. True, it is not the best plot and does not have a plausible ending, but it is for kids after all. My daughter just read the same book for school and i have to admit it...i read it again! Far better than the outsiders for a 'kids without adults' book."
5,Individualism for children,"My nine-year-old finished this 200-page book today, then I read it! Not a week ago I finished reading Atlas Shrugged for the third time in twenty years. The book cleverly draws on Rands' individualism, illustrates to children why private property is vital to civilization, and shows how gangs of mindless brutes don't stand a chance against the powerful mind of a small girl. To call the heroine a ""totalitarian,"" as some reviewers have suggested, is absurd. If you're a guest in someone's house, and you suddenly become unwelcome, then showing you the door doesn't make the host a fascist!"
4,An enticing novel,"The Girl Who Owned a City, is sure to satisfy the appetites of any sci-fi reader. In world without adults, children are forced to survive on their own. And survive they do, when a girl named Lisa finds a fortress for them to live in. Lisa also finds them food, supplies, and even toys in abundance. The fortress protects them from local gangs, who try to steal their supplies. Great characters, a wonderful plot, and an exiting climax are just some of the things that make this book superb! Don't miss out on The Girl Who Owned a City, by O.T. Nelson."
5,THE GIRL WHO OWNED A CITY,"THIS IS DEFENENTLEY THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. WELL I YOU WANT TO READ IT BUT ARE LAZY LIKE ME, ""READ"" IT ON A PROGRAM CALL KURZWEILL BUT, ITS ABOUT THIS PLAGE THAT KILLS ALL ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF 12 AND THE KIDS ARE LEFT ALONE TO LEARN TO SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN THIS GIRL, LISA GAINS CONTROL OF HER HOME STREET GRANDAVENUE THEN SHE CONTROLS A HIGHSCHOOL AND IN ONE YEAR FILLS IT WITH 500 KIDS AND IS FACED WITH GANGS AND THE LEADER OF THE GANGS TOM LOGEN IM READING IT IN SCHOOL AND THATS AS FAR AS I HAVE GOTTEN THANKS HOPE YOU READ IT SOON!!! NOVEMBER 17, 2005"
1,This book was lame and must be inproved in many places.,In the beggining everything was way to easy for Lisa and every body else for that matter. Everybody acted far to old for their age-there's no waya five-year-old could drive a car. I think the characters were very unrealistic and unbelievable. In the middle the book got a bit better but the small spark of goodness was spoiled witha horrible ending. There is no way I could ever believe in a gang leader actually getting talked out of taking over a city. Maybe if he was really nice he would have made an alliance with Lisa but I find no way he could of gotten talked out of it. This all in all was a terrible book.
2,FABULOUS STORY! terribly written,"BLEAH! I read this book when I was in first grade, and at that time, I thought it was marvelous. And the plot is. But the WRITING! ugh, it was TERRIBLE! Not to mention, the Lisa the main girl is a total and complete DICTATOR!she even admits it! here's a passage:""Selfish? I guess I am. But there's more to it than that. Don't forget, this was MY discovery.""So right from the off, you have a main character that you hate to the guts. Guess what? you have to make it through 200 pages with this main character who you totally HATE! And the writing is like a KINDERGARTENERS! *sigh* overall, a let down book."
1,"If I could give this zero, I would","This book teaches that freedom means giving in to one high leader. if people really want to read this book, go ahead. otherwise, throw this book out with the rest of the garbage."
5,A long time ago...,I read this book as a child - I am now 32 with a ten year old of my own and I have finally ordered a copy for her (after searching through my mother's attic and all my old books - I am a bookworm and have tons AND forgetting the title and author's name but not the story!). Thanks go to Eleanor9 at askme.com for reading my story synopsis and being able to provide me with title and author and thanks to Amazon for having this book in stock!
5,This book means so much,"I have read this book an infinite number of times and I can't tell you in what way it changed me. This book is so special. I've worn out 2 copies and am on my third. I'm 15 now, but this book means different things at different ages, I have to tell you if you're debating about whether to buy this book, don't, you won't regret it."
4,Lisa in Charge,"Lisa wanted to make her own city when all of the people over the age of 12 died. She wanted to make her owne miliia and shedid. When Lisa made the militia and got the school, everyone helped get the school the way she wanted it. After they got going, Lisa got shot in the butt, but that did not stop her from getting back at her enemy,Tom Logan. She eventually worked her way back to a leadership role. The book left the reader wondering what would happen next."
5,An emerging classic,"This book even after 20 years remains my most unforgettable reading experiences. Sure, it's contoversial with the charismatic Lisa setting up a totalitarian government that was run benevolently by her. But I've always been struck at how the story pushes self determination. The city worked because it was ""fun"" to work at what you enjoyed and it only benfited the community at large. At the core this is a most positive message. Although I never saw Lisa as a Christ-like figure, I can see how some of her followers over time may come to regard her as such. She herself might become her own worst enemy. Points like these would probably be answered in a sequel or two, which it seems will never be written."
3,A good read for imaginative readers with a few down sides - Prachi,I thought this book was good and bad. The main idea grabbed thereaders attention and the idea of living with no adults or no rules isabsolutely mind blowing.The author did a great job in describing thecharacters and especially Lisa.She worked so hard and was so dedicated.Ithink after a while of reading the book the author started to overdo thestory.It was like adding too much garlic to a recipe.The ending also wasvery sudden and it left you with an unfulfilled feeling. The author didan overall good job and I think this book is great for imaginativereaders even with a few down sides.
4,Apocalypse for Juniors,"When I read this in middle school, it was hard not be caught up in the story. My generation never got ""Robinson Crusoe"", ""Tom Sawyer"" or ""Treasure Island"" so this was the closest I got to the adventure novel. There are certain leaps of logic that need to be taken -- where are all the bodies of the adults, for instance, and what about late bloomers and early developers? -- but I remember it as a generally well-rendered if optimistic vision of what happens after the world has ended. As each generation passes on less and less practical knowledge to the next, it's a fitting to wonder what children would be able to reconstruct from the hollow remains of their parents' world and what they would not. I'm the only one of my friends who was raised to build furniture and use power tools. How many kids know what's under the hood of a tractor or an engine? Lisa, the protagonist, becomes an embodiment of the seldom-realized American ideal of self-reliance."
5,Just when you thought you knew everything about Who.......,".......along comes John Kenneth Muir with a refreshingly objective analysis of the long-running science-fiction favorite. This book is a thesis, not a celebration, with well-thought out views on topics such as the series creation, its context, its characters, and its stories. The writing is excellent, with each topic being fully explored and easily flowing into the next. The various episode reviews will send you scrambling for your Who tapes and DVDs to watch a story with a new perspective. It is an honest and sensitive exploration of the positive and negative aspects of the show without all the mindless hype. If you are a fan of Doctor Who, you will have a great time with this book."
2,Pintail / Widgeon Duck call,Didn't sound like anything.... several of us tried it...just sounded like a cheep toy.Sorry Willie...but I stilll iove the show!
5,Breakthrough Book,"This book is immediately helpful! After reading through a very interesting life story of the author, the book outlines simple details of THE TOOL. Using THE TOOL has helped me to clear up a sinus condition the very first time I tried it !His life story details his progress towards creating THE TOOL in a scientific manner.. hypothosis followed by experiment leading to conclusion. Definetely recommended reading for anybody willing to stretch the bounds of healing and reality manifestation."
4,Solid lamp,"Nice design, easy to mount and use. Nice dimmer switch and well articulated arm for the light."
5,caught up in something thats to hard to handle?,"i read this book and got sucked in completely by the end of the second page! it's a story from the present to the future seeing the consequences of a rumour, lydia is framed of stealing a school trophy. although she didn't do it no-one believes her and her whole family suffer. she goes out to a hill and falls into the future. she sees what has happened now that she is dead. a story unravels and she gets more and more shocked along the way. when the person who started the rumour learns her lesson, lydia falls back to the present where she confronts the rumour and lives to tell the tale. the book is very enjoyable and i recommend it to anyone."
5,great watch,I bought this a gift for my son. He does not like to wear watches but he has loved this one.
2,"Good watch , quality is not",I liked the watch and the big numbers display and the night vision. The problem is after sometimes the color painting on the surface will flake.
4,"nice, but not that good looking as I expected","Generally it is a nice watch, I love its color and the pattern. but it does look as good as I expected, if the screem is not a circle, so it looks a little bit fat."
2,Author lacks experience with the drug,"I was disappointed with this book. The first author is a doctor, but appears to have no experience actually prescribing the drug. He was asked to write the book when the drug was to be released in the US but had little or no first-hand experience with its use. Therefore, the entire book reads like a very pedantic review of the scientific literature, with long sections explaining things such as what double-blind studies mean. Furthermore, the author is overly cautious in that despite dozens of studies he is often unwilling to reach tentaive conclusions but says more studies are needed.The book Stop Depression Now by Richard Brown et al. on Sam-e describes extensive experience with prescribing the drug to hundreds of patients and contains everything and more from this book. While Brown may be somewhat an over-enthusiastic salesperson, the book contained much more useful information."
1,reizen talking super cube can't keep the date,I bought the Reizen talking cube for my mother who has macular degeneration. Within one month it started to malfunction and would reset itself to a date in 2002. She could not see the buttons on the back (small and black) and so could not reset. My brother and I keep resetting it but it keeps going back to 2002. Great design if it only worked!
4,Need Some Help,Gave this to my 84 year old mother. She was doubtful at first but really likes the Cube. She has lost the instructions. Anybody know where I can get another copy?
3,"Idea is great, cheaply made","This is the second Talking Cube I've purchased for my low-vision mother. While she loves it and calls it her talking man in a box, I had to replace it within a few months because the buttons on the bottom of the cube, used to change the time/date, got jammed when I pressed them to change the time. Its a great concept, just wish it was made a little better."
3,Good if you are on a budget,"My grandfather is blind and his old talking clock broke. This one that I found was the same shape and size of his old clock so there wasn't much new for him to learn. I also liked the voice can be either super loud or normal. As far as the date and the time go, there are only 2 buttons to press so there isn't anything confusing about it.The main issue I have is that it looks cheaply made and it loses time. I placed brand new batteries in it and 2 months later is had lost over 30 minutes of time. My grandfather didn't have a clue how to change the time, because the settings are on the bottom of the clock and difficult to see and figure out."
1,Bitter Disappointment,"Although the lipstick came in new packaging, it was rancid. Smelled bad and the seller wouldn't accept it back. $25 down the drain!"
5,Fantastic!!!!!,Always loved this book - the recipes are GREAT! Back on Weight Watchers again with a friend so ordered this one for her! She loves it too!
3,Problem with the plug-purchased at AMAZON,"The product is good, however, the advertising didn't adequately explain that this would not plug into a standard wall receptacle so now I am searching for a 20 AMP TO 15 AMP converter plug. They should have done a much better job showing the plug. Otherwise, it is a very solid piece of equipment."
2,NEMA 5-20 plug,"Be warned, this powerstrip uses the NEMA 5-20 type plug, and will need an adapter if you want to plug it into a standard US outlet.Mine arrived bent along the length, so it can not lie flat on the wall."
1,negative review for Computer Animation Extravaganza & Marvels,"It's definetely not worth buying. It's set of 2 DVDs and outof all the animations only 3 are worth watching - Bingo, Tight ropeand Migration. Rest is crap. All the animationsare outdated and even the three good ones are more than five yearsold. Instead one should buy a DVD of any latest blockbuster3d animated movie."
3,Great CD's but disappointed...,"I love, love, love Kenny Rogers and the CD's included are awesome. Based on content alone, I would give the product a 5-star rating. However, the collector's tin that the CD's are in was crushed on the front, which ruins the appeal of having the tin. Wish I had received one in good condition!"
1,Bootleg copy of ATB Greatest hits............,The CD came in great condition however it was an obvious bootleg copy....it won't register on my computer etc.......but the for the money I guess i can't complain much.
4,Lots a compliments at a recent dinner pary,"We purchased (2) of these and after (1) came damaged and Amazon's prompt replacement we got these on the dinner table for a recent dinner party and got lots of compliments. We use them for Parmesan Cheese, jelly and other condiments when entertaining."
3,it ok BUT,It ok but very flimsy.. The handle is cheap and the top is even cheaper.. Have a feeling its going to be dropped.. Im using it for storing salt so my wife doesnt use her hand to measure it out.. but have a feeling im going to be picking up alot of salt of the floor soon.. if any one has a better suggestion send me a message please..
4,Entra el mundo de Tepoztlan,"Aunque este libro es para juveniles tiene mucho para el adulto tambien. Jose Agustin nos ofrece el mundo de nuestros antigous pasados. Es una fantasia donde los dioses de los Aztecas viven otra vez y se aparecen a un grupo de jovenes que salen para pasar el dia en autobus. Los infantiles son interesante pero los mas interesante es el mundo que descubren.Cuando salen a visitar Tepoztlan Tor, Homero, Erika, Alain, Selene y Yanira se juntan con un amigo que se llama Pedro. Aqui comience una aventura donde descubren un mundo perdido y majico lleno de personajes asombrosos y los juveniles tienen la oportunidad de conocer el mundo con otros ojos. El libro es corto y facil para leer y el lector lo puede terminar pronto. No es necessario poder leer Espanol perfecto porque esta escrito para juveniles. Es perfecto para estudiantes que estan aprendiendo Espanol. Es una historia majico para todos edades pero especialmente para los ninos."
3,Hardly Complete,"The title is a bit deceptive - this book serves best as a primer for those who have little or no prior knowledge of help desks. Those familiar with the topic will quickly move through the book and discover that the better half is devoted to synopsii of help desk applications. And while that information is useful, much of it is readily available on the Internet.For those researching help desks for the sake of a technical writing project or for managers looking for information to improve an existing help desk, this book will likely fall short of the mark.The writer's style is encouraging and you do sense that she knows much more than the book contains. And the pages that deal with workplace ergonomics were nice, although they didn't seem alltogether pertitent to the main theme.Not a bad book, but hardly ""complete."""
2,Too Little Substance too many vendor lists,"Looking for a ""complete"" guide to helpdesks, I was disappointed to read this book and find not a lot of substance. I picked up this book at a call center trade show for a low price. It was not even worth the [dollar amount] that I paid for it.If you subscribe to Call Center Magazine or some other Call center publication, you will be able to research the various vendors yourself.Don't spend your money on this book"
4,Excellent Book,I would recommend this book to any IT Professional or end user. There are many Information Technology books out there on the market today but this one is top notch! Thanks and I look foward to reading more!
3,Could have been better,"This book does have some deficiencies. First, this book suffered from a number of mistakes and misconceptions (IPSEC policies comes to mind). Second, the book's organization is often haphazard and disjointed. Third, I didn't feel that topic exposition was as well thought out as the 70-210 Pro or 70-215 Server Readiness Review books (they are definitely better).Even with its obvious problems, I still recommend the book. Other books rarely drill down the level of detail that the readiness review books do. This is the first of the series that I have not been completely satisfied with."
4,What does Trevor Brown have to do with Helen Oxenbury's edition?,"There are three reviews to this edition that talk about Trevor Brown's contribution, including the cover, to this book. Surely these comments should have been attached to a different book. This book is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury, and there is no attribution anywhere, including the cover, that has to do with Trevor Brown.By the way, the Oxenbury illustrations are typical of her style. Frankly, as a collector of Carrolliana, I find Oxenbury's illustrations to be far too precious to hold the interest of adults, but others might find them to be appropriate for a child. The edition is well printed, on good paper and with solid color."
4,Memory Maker,"Although the graphics are simple, the lyrics will make memories for your children. I am reordering this video as my sons, age 10 & 14, still remember the cute, catchy folk songs from their childhood Joe Scruggs video. They actually want the video back into our family library. You'll be humming them too!"
