4,An excellent reference book,"Examples are good and explained in details. Simple English and easy to understand in minutes. However if download is allowed in source coding, it is much better. Difficult to read the coding in Kindle. I hope the publisher can improve the problem. Noone likes to bring the one-inch think textbook from time to time."
3,partial examples,The examples are not complete. You are trying to learn and the author leaves out steps/code you need to understand how it works
3,Inheritance,"I think chapter 8 misuses the term ""inheritance"", which will muddy the waters for someone trying to understand inheritance. It says ""Each object has a prototype whose properties it inherits"". Would it be better to say ""You can tack new methods or properties on to an existing class (eg: String) using the prototype property""?"
5,Roy Montgomery - 'And Now The Rain Sounds Like Life Is Falling Down' (Drunken Fish),"Never knew just how many (?) CD's that Roy Mongomery has out. Every bit as great as his 'Temple IV' effort (see my review). Tunes here that had me giving this disc repeated spins were the beautifully-played ""Down From That Hill And Up To The Pond"", ""Catherine At Aldeburgh"", ""Entertaining Mr. Jones"", the wailing ""Algeria 7"" and the eleven-minute would-have-made a nice soundtrack for a movie ""I At Home"". Call this lo-fi, call it indie, call it - space rock - or whatever you like. Point here is this player gives it his all. Highly recommended."
1,Few of these are traditional Catholic Hymns,"These are modern hymns composed by priests who are 60's radicas and seek to use ""tip to through the tulips songs."" Our Holy Father Pope Benedict XVI has stated, ""These songs are fine for Church socials, but not for use during the Most Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. They are an abomination before the Lord! Those priests who hid in the seminary to avoid service in Vietnam should find other employment instead of attacking Sacred Catholic Music. (Kevin DeCoste)"
4,Slightly disappointed,"I bought this CD for the song ""Here I Am Lord"" and was very disappointed to find that he does not sing the complete song. The middle verse is left out. Otherwise, his voice is beautiful and it is a lovely CD."
3,"Good, but wayyyyyyyyyyy too short","This is a book about books. The author describes some of his more interesting finds in the book world.This book was an interesting read. The author's wondefully breezy writing style was enchanting and fun to read. His anecdotes on various book finds made you feel as though you were right next to him.So why the 3 stars?This book took me exactly 2 hours to read! It is compact and has so few pages, that I felt a little discouraged from the start.This author truly is entertaining with his stories and if his career spans over 40 years, surely he could have added a couple more (like maybe a 100 or so more) pages to the book. Just as I was starting to really get into it, the book ends.I was also put off by the cost of the book. $20.00 for 2 hours of reading is expensive!However, if you like books on books that are a fun read, this is the book for you."
3,"Basbanes ""Lite""","Basically this is a vanity press offering prepared by the author to cash in on the rare book collecting momentum, earlier stimulated by Nicholas Basbanes. It is essentially a ""chapbook"". It is about 150 pages, which at it's list price comes to about $.15 a page or $.30 for both sides. (Covers included free of charge). It talks little about book collecting or even scouting except for the author's meandering about a few interesting trips and people met along the way. I strongly encourage those interested in book collecting to read ANY of Mr. Basbanes books before purchasing this overpriced narcissistic exercise."
4,Blackmail is the Cause of Death,"Margaret Maron's DEATH IN BLUE FOLDERS is the third in her series with Lt. Sigrid Harald.Clayton Gladwell is winding up his law office and returning private files to his clients for a price, which gets him murdered. His office is a disaster area and some files have been burned in a trash can.This is a tight police procedural with a fascinating cast of characters. Each of whom has a secret they wish to hide from the public or the authorities.Excellent reading.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
4,Death in Blue Folders (Sigrid Harald),"I bought this as a replacement for a long-lost copy. I had almost forgotten how good Margaret Maron was from the beginning! (I was delighted that she brought back Sigrid Harald in her two latest books.) This one had more characters than I usually care for, but Margaret Maron made it easy--well, possible-- for me to keep these characters straight.I'm deliberately not saying anything at all about the plot---advice to the newcomer: if you haven't read the early ones, you have a treat in store if you read them now."
3,A Southern Garden,"I found this book entertaining reading of a gardener's journal. Nothing more. I did not find many of the plants and plant material the author used applicable to my southern garden. In fact, once the reader gets to the end and reads the prologue you will know even Ms. Lawrence made some mistakes so I was happy I was not jumping on board to pick out her plant materials. I did like her views on a garden-a plant must look good and do well without babying it and if it does not time to try something new. I'm sure her garden was beautiful for its time."
2,Sounds too Mexican,I bought this SACD thinking that it would be Latin Jazz Cuban stuff and I was not impress at all. Other than the piano work which is flawless work by Rebeca Mauleon singer jumps off to mexican screams which is not Latin Jazz at all. Timbalero Escovedo is mediocre at best. Doesn't keep a clean Cuban clave and that is exactly what he is trying to accomplice here.SAVE YOUR CASH.
4,Toy machine welcome to hell,It is only about 30 minutes but it is soo nostalgic. you have to buy this. very great era of skateboarding
3,Tres belle y magnifique!,"This was a beautifully written and tragic story of the love between a man and a sadly fated courtesan. This novel is quite a page turner, and it's very emotional as well. However, it didn't make me cry or feel deeply sorry for the characters at the end, just a bit sad. This is a nice classic, but it's not a deeply significant classic to read, nor is it one where you will get some deep, insight lessons from. If you are into romance, drama, and tragedy, then this book is for you. Just don't expect it to change your life or anything."
2,Incredibly insipid.,"Man, I have mixed feelings about this one. First of all, in a time of MTV-destroyed music (with things like J-Lo and Beyonce ruling the charts) any chance of an echo from the past is well received.So, I went to check this DVD, even knowing that ""ASIA"" was not playing in it. The ""real"" ASIA must have Wetton, Palmer, Downes and Howe or, at least, the former three with another guitarrist.The result is a bunch of great songs played in a unintersting way by a strange band, with a faceless guitar player, a ""I've Played With Them All"" drummer (Chris Slade), a potent new singer and a sleepy Downes. Really not enjoyable, my friends."
2,Tragedy!,"Geoff Downes must pay his bills, so he keeps carrying the ASIA flag even if this is not ASIA at all!! The singer and bassist, Paynes, makes me wanna puke with his exaggerated singing, destroying the old classics, even if it's clear the guy can sing like few people do. The guitarrist is a joke, his stage presence is equal to zero. Chris Slade on drums is a remarkable drummer and, as with any band he's ever played, he plays with conviction, but this is not enough to save this dumb DVD. Downes himself clearly is not enjoying none of it, playing for the paycheck. I regret ever buying this thing."
1,WEEEAAAK!,"really a bummer of a let down. nobody from asia is playing, well i guess geoff downes on the keyboards is playing but otherwise a bunch of cover players! waste of time, money, whatever! you will regret this one. this one is a no burner!"
2,"NICE, BUT NOT SO NICE","Great sound and picture. I have two major complaints about this DVD. 1) Kings Of The Day, Keyboard solo, Love Under Fire, Sad Situation, Longest Night & Love Under Fire, which are listed as being on the DVD, are not there, 2) Put the interviews on separatly, instead of between songs. THIS IS A HUGE DITRACTION, when your getting into the concert."
3,"Talk about ""oversinging""...","I have known about ""overacting"", but the new singer in Asia makes a real ""oversinging""! Man, the guy (he's also the bass player) has a incredibly powerful and beautiful voie, but sometimes he sings like if he was in a gospel church!! It's really annoying, mainly on the old classics.Anyway, there are times when he can restrain himself, and the band as a whole is very good (check Chris Slade on drums. The guy is a consumate pro, decades on the road with artists going from AC/DC through Jimmy Page). The set list was also good.Another flaw is the guitar sound. It is ludicrously thin here, I can't tell if it was sounding this way at the live show or the damage was done in the mixing table.In generalm it's worth watching. Like someone below said, it's miles better than the crap that flows through the airwaves nowadays...."
4,nothing fancy but good if you've never seen them live!!,I bought this strictly to hear john payne sing the wetton era songs and that is what made it for me!!!
1,Ugh.,"Please find something else to do with your hard earned money than buy this. If you are a fan of ASIA circa 1982 you will be HORRIFIED at the Broadway show tune versions of classics like ""Heat of the Moment"", ""Only Time Will Tell"" and even ""Go"" from the third album ASTRA. The only thing more disturbing is the guitarist, Guthrie Govan soloing vomitously over every song--imagine a cut rate Steve Vai hacking away at songs you have loved for 20+ years. Just say no!!!"
3,"ROCK ON,ELDON","o.k.,this cd doesnt suck by any means,especially if you are already familiar with the Mentors/El Duce.the music here is slower,but El's lyrics are as hilarious as ever(in my humble opinion).the slower presentation is almost hypnotic-like,drilling his filth into your brain like a piledriver.the only complaint i have is the production is pretty ""modest"" (well,crappy).the only reason i dont give it a 4 star rating.."
4,RIP El Duce!!!!!,"This was one of EL Duce's solo albums, done without any of the Mentors. The musicians are actually from the metal band COVEN. It's typical Duce, sex, drugs, booze, and rock n roll themed. Different musically than the mentors,...is a bit slower, but it's definitely worth picking up.Watch out for the trains EL!!!!"
3,not what I exspected,This English-Polish talking dictionary is fine if you are trying to learn English. I was under the influance that this product would teach Polish more-so then English. So if you want to learn polish this would NOT be the item of my choice.
2,Great work by the author . . . Pathetic editing by the publisher,"Anyone inspired by CS Lewis magnificent chapter, The Great Sin, in Mere Christianity will find great value in Andrew Murray's straight talk on humility.The challenge is getting past the myriad of typos and mis-punctuation. Mr. Publisher, are you irresponsible? Or just lazy?"
5,Remarkable,"Andrew Murray takes a topic that is so commonplace in Christian circles, and takes it to a new depth of understanding. When the book is finished it is easy to see that the Church has overlooked and taken for granted this quality of Jesus."
2,a classic,I read the basic contents of this book on Wikipedia by typing in authors name...he died in 1917 and this book is a classic.
5,Andrew Murray's Humility book,"This is by far the best book on humility that I have come across to date. Andrew Murray conveys the message of the cross loud and clear--the Christian walk is not the warm and fuzzy existence that many contemporary Christians have mistakenly signed up for. It is the narrow path that few will find and is filled with all kinds of humbling twists and turns that bring us to the place in which Jesus forged the way..death to self! Not a popular concept or easy to embrace in these earth suits, but crucial for the deeper walk. Beware though...it has brought about some unexpected changes in my life--not easy, but ultimately good!"
5,Highly Recommended,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone serious about their spiritual formation or transformation into Christ likeness. If you've been contemplating 1 Cor 13, you may find that this book gives you some additional insight."
5,Humility: The Journey Toward Holiness,"This is much more that an book. It is truely a handbook for every believer. Keep it with your Bible and close to your heart. Give it to everyone you know who has a hunger for more of God.God bless,TDH, NC"
4,Humility by Andrew Murray,Very deep and convicting book. You will not regret purchasing this from Andrew Murrary. Have other books by Murray and have not been dissapointed in anyone of them.
2,humility,"a very difficult read due to errors in the transcript. content would be good if it were punctuated correctly so you could read it easily. don't know if it was written that way or if the publisher needs a new proofreader. whatever the reason, it's a frustrating read."
4,Old Mentor's and revised,"Well back in 1989 The Mentors went into the studios and created this album. When it came out on cassette side 1 was 8 tracks of The Mentors originally recorded back in 1979 and a young El Duce was just starting to get his classic rough voice that many Mentor fans came to love in the years later. Side 2 of the recordings in some ways was The Mentors updating there early Mystic records anti New Wave songs for the new stream of teeny pop glam rock metal bands of the day.A prime example is from the song Get Up and Die! ""Cinderella, Motley Crue and Poison... I wanna see them get run over by a steam roller... YEAH! ""I saw these guys in the last Seattle performance and if never saw them you missed out, but if you think there music was something. There live shows where a blast, especially the wrap up parties.So all HAIL The Sleaze Kings of Rock and R.I.P. Duce."
3,The chirps are not effective as an alarm.,"I put this on my Prius and backed up to within feet of mywife who was gardening. It's loud enough but she didnt noticeit because the chirps blended perfectly with all the birds in the yard.I changed it for one with sounds of a train chugging, completewith whistle and bells which is a more effective warning."
1,Does not sound like a back up alarm,This product does not sound like a back up alarm but may be great for calling birds.
4,Ask Ed: Informative and Helpful,"Ask Ed : Marijuana Law : Don't Get Busted is a beautifully written book filled with common and uncommon questions about medicinal marijuana. The book is a useful tool for activists for medicinal marijuana or even the common person who wants to know about the subject. The book is written by one of the top writers on the subject of medicinal marijuana. I loved this book and found it helpful for statistical reports I have done on the subject, and even to improve my knowledge of the matter. I found it easy to read, and I keep at as a refrence guide for my own personal use. I recommend this to all who wish to have a better understanding of medicinal marijuana."
2,Not worth it,"Thought I'd try these out so I could save some money (by not having to buy dryer sheets) and do my part for the environment (not throwing out all the dryer sheets). However, I don't think these help reduce drying time, they seem to always be stuck in a sleeve or somewhere. And they do NOTHING for static cling, which in the winter is a real problem. So I end up using dryer sheets for most loads anyway. The only load they seem to work for is towels, as there isn't a place for them to get stuck and they don't have much static cling anyway."
3,no idea if it really works - though I use them all the time,I always stick them in the dryer but haven't noticed any difference. I'm too lazy to do comparative testing with regards to dry timing and static cling tests. I thought they would be good because of less chemicals in the cloths versus dryer sheets.I was concerned of the plastic melting but so far the balls have retained their shape.
3,Good for baby clothes,"You are not supposed to use dryer sheets or fabric softners on baby clothes because it reduces flame-retardance and they may irritate a baby's skin. These dryer balls have been great for softening my baby's clothes without chemicals. No, they don't do squat for static cling. I didn't notice a change in drying time. And in a load of adult clothes, they usually end up stuck in a sleeve. But for a load of little baby items where they can tumble freely, they do a great job of softening."
2,Tennis Balls As Good As Dryer Balls! And Less $$!,"I did a little test while I was visiting my Daughter-In-Law, who possesses not only Dryer Balls, but a nice supply of tennis balls. For the test I washed two feather pillows from our motor home, which had become musty during storage. I washed them separately, each with a towel to balance the load. After washing, I dried each set with a dryer sheet in addition to the balls, mostly for fragrance: one set of pillow and towel with the dryer balls and one set with two tennis balls. Both thumped noisily around in the dryer and both walloped the feather pillows and towels back to equal fluffiness. I had considered purchasing dryer balls, but my daughter-in-law contributed the two test tennis balls and I am have been perfectly happy with the results."
2,Better than nothing,"If you can't use dryer sheets or fabric softener, this is better than nothing at all. Static cling still abounds, unfortunately. Many times the balls get stuck in arms of clothing so it takes a bit of searching before starting the next load. Not a big deal. I'm glad I bought them, but I still long to use dryer sheets."
5,Infinite Odyssey=Infinite Fun for the reader,"This book is a suprisingly good and fast paced read. The book has rich and endearing characters. I couldn't believe it, but the lead character Aktar, is a giant regal bird, it's soo cool. The Sci-fi inventions are awesome. And in the back of the book there is even a glossary with definations and more info on the wild and new lands, tech toys and creatures. Even better a smashing good ending, really surprising, couldn't of quessed the ending , just like Agatha Christie. So I don't want to spoil it for you, but lets just say,it all makes sense in the end. I actually know the Author and this is the real deal. First Chris Paloni, now Jay Dingler. The future is now, finally some Science Fiction from an Author under 50 or who isn't dead."
4,A Great Album !!,"Showcases the talents of this underated Newcastle Band.With Gleesons vocals and Walmsleys guitar and song writing ability, this is the jets were at a stage where the public either got it or didn't. It had to be due to the a lack of exposure and lack of faith shown by the company in charge and were never able to aspire to the heights they deserved.This is a quality album and they may have got better."
5,"For practical use, this is the one","There isn't any other book I'm aware of that gives the coordinates of ALL the regular polytopes in 4 dimensions. (Higher dimensions, also covered, don't have as many) He even includes the 'biggie' which is the 120-cell (or the 600-cell, depending on how you look at it). And of course Sommerville also gives the coordinates of the dodecahedron (a building block of the 120-cell) and the icosahedron, platonic 3D solids. If you want to start to party down in 4D with more than just the classic hypercube, trust me, this book is one to get."
4,American Dream's Worst Case Scenario,"The American Dream's worst case scenario; Manifest Destiny's darkest heart-people with everything they need moving West because the next best thing, the finally fulfilling thing, the Big Rock Candy Mountain, is over the horizon. But along the way, snow and hunger and the darkness of the human heart pouring out and spreading with the blizzards. Perhaps the most telling line in this documentary is written by one of the 12 year old girls who survives the six month ordeal and by summer time is writing to her cousin. ""Come West,"" she writes, ""and come quickly. Just don't take no short cuts."" The power of the Manifest Destiny, and the pull of California, the ending point not only of America's Manifest Destiny, but an itchy-footed journey taken over centuries by west bound peoples leaving Greece, leaving Italy, bound always for something better, for something more."
4,Buy this if you like dance music!,"This is one of the best imports I have. This version of ""Keep on Pumpin It"" is one of the best dance songs I have in my huge collection. My ""favorite tracks are 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, & 11 with ""What Do I Have to Do?"" (UK remix) as the second behind ""Keep..."" for my lauds. This released in 1993, not '98 or whatever the listing says here. In the cover photo she is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. Buy this if you like dance and def. buy if you like Kylie! --Kurt kirton@iol-12.net"
4,disappointing after the melodic genius of previous CDs,"To be honest, I think Frontline should have been one of the biggest acts in the nineties. They concentrated on Japan and even released a Japanese only CD, the classic & INMENSE ""Heroes"" CD. The European release that followed ""Right Attitude"" comprised 8 tracks from ""Heroes"" plus 7 new tracks and was a magnificent statement of intent from a band determined to take up the mantle of class 80's acts like Journey, Bad Habit, Bad English... Frontline are powerful AOR. Catchy choruses, good keys and powerful guitars. However on this release the sound has been considerably beefed up. The riffs exude a Dokken-style intensity that leaves little room for the songs to breathe. There's nothing here to match superlative tracks like the band's classic tunes, ""Any other Way"", ""Shelter Me"" and above all the and Journey-esque & bombastic ""Who's Crying now"". If, by chance, you're new to Frontline, don't start here but spend time searching for ""Heroes""..."
4,The Power of Six,"David Hoffman's ""The Oligarchs"" documents in great detail the rise of 6 businessmen--Aleksandr Smolensky, Yuri Luzhkov, anatoly Chubais, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky--who became the ""oligarchs"" who shaped the political and economic landscape of the New Russia. They were merely ordinary Russians until the Soviet Union collapsed. So how did a mere handful Russians end up controlling such an epic proportion of Russia's economy and have such great influence in its politics? And how did they manage to rise at Russia's decline? Hoffman's book will answer these questions by piecing together extensive research and interview to create a well-balanced, serious but at the same time, a downright fun and readable book. ""The Oligarchs"" is a landmark."
4,Good Job!,"Much better than I expected, a serious work with a great deal of research invovled. It avoided the typical lurid embellishments of the genre, and also made the point of the important period of transistion in the Gorbachev period, where nascent Russian capitalism started. It lacks somewhat in that it focuses on only six men, and they are of varying importance in the post-Yeltsin period. As Putin reportedly said when asked about Berezovsky--""Who?"" Nevertheless, a good job, an interesting read and thankfully avoids falling into the tabloid style of so much of the literature on the topic."
1,Bad Experience,I have been taking either cold or hot showers for two years... can never get an in between temperature. I would not recommend this to anyone!!!
4,Did it's job,"Helped heal my Betta's fins to the point they were growing back beautiful and straight. The bottle is small, it only has enough in it for two sessions of fin rot. That could be because I have a 2 gallon tank, and most stores seem to expect people to house their Bettas in three cups of water..."
3,Not what i expected,"Pretty to look at, horrible to drink. I made some very pleasing centerpieces as these are very pretty when they have ""bloomed"", but the tea itself is a very earthy taste, not what I would recommend, nor as a tea drinker, anything I would buy again."
3,flowering tea,"Altho, I'm enjoying the taste of the tea, the flowering leaves alot.The flower falls apart quickly and has no color to it."
4,Black Poet's Diary By Hatteras D.,"Jazmin's Notebook by Nikki Grimes is about a poor african american girl who lives in foster homes with her sister CeCe, and Jazmin writes poems to calm herself in hard times and also uses her notebook to write about her life .I thinks a great book and I relate to Jazmin because I write to calm me down but only I use story writing. I would recommend this to girls who have a diary because it is written in journal format. Read this book and get indide Jazmin's head."
2,Deseree:Jazmin's Tough Life,"Jazmine is a 14-year old who lives with her sister, CeCe, in Harlem, NYC during the 1960's, where danger is everywhere. She's smart, strong, and talented with a poetic gift. Her mother is in the hospital for drug use, and they don't have enough money to buy food, but she fights through it all, and tries to find her purpose in life.Jazmin's Notebook was not a very interesting book. It didn't catch my intrest at the begining. There are some parts that caught my interest because when she was smoking and almost got raped, I continued to read to see what happened next. Overall the book doesn't have the spark for today's youth to read and enjoy.I would recommend this book to kids in the sixth and seventh grades. The literature is realitvy easy to read. This book is for entertainment, and to show how people who don't have much money live."
5,Very good fit,I bought these for my 4 year old daughter and 5 year old son and they fit both just fine. My daughter is very small for her age and my son is average for his.
2,pale shadow of ilsa.,This is a pale imitation of ilsa she wolf of the s.s.it was filmed in the midseventies with even less money than the other movie. This is a movie for those who want a low budget exploitation movie that is mainly exploitive in regards to soft core sex.Attractive women agents of elsa try to trick soldiers on leave in their sex train. the poor soldiers who speak of defeat are then killed. In real life during the later war years the NAZI's were indeed executing those who criticized hitler and other party ideals and especailly they died if they talked of defeat.I don't know if they used entrapments with beautiful women though. But it's a interesting idea and this bottom budget movie is at least tolerable if you aren't expecting violence exploitation as well as the sexploitation. The filmmakers were also hoping for a sequel as well with the open ended ending. So if you want mild sexploitation without alot of extreme violence then this may be ok for you.
4,Pummeling,"This is the best CD I have heard yet this year and by far, the most jawdropping. I can only suggest that you buy this immediately and see for yourself. This has to be one of the most slept on bands right now. I'm not saying they're going to be huge but there will inevitably be comparisons to Big Business. Personally, I think they're even better... but that's just my taste.It cannot be stated enough how heavy and powerful this cd is."
3,Screaming Sream-o with Melvins or Big Business but Faster,"Screaming Sream-o with Melvins or Big Business, but Faster.Its similar to Big Business but without the Business.The vocals do nothing for me.Still, if you think you might like thrashing distorted bass-guitar and a load of fast drumming, you will like this album.Its a cross between math rock and the Melvins."
1,ludicrous,"if you are looking for something creative with absolutely no intelligent, skeptical, analytical, objective though, this is for you. the level of research and critical thought here is like high-school English level. it is rife with assumptions and completely lacking any evidence or intelligent argument; a complete joke."
5,"Finally, some answers!!!","Very well written! Lucid! Credible! And courageous in outlook and comprehensive in scope. This book does not dismiss Judaism/Christianity, but validates it with great care. Kudos to you, Mrs. Jones! I admire your work and hope you will do a follow up pertaining to ""The War In Heaven"" and the nature of Satan. In the very least, a great and substantial post-modern contribution to field of UFOlogy. Thank you!"
2,Things I didn't like.,"I found the dialogue laughable when Mr. Woods didn't intend it to be. The climax lasted about two pages. I figured out the ""secret"" of the twins before I was halfway through the book. There was so much fluff in this book that had nothing to do with the central plot that at the end I felt like I had been snookered into reading 300+ pages for a plot that actually took up maybe 50 pages. It took a willing suspension of disbelief to believe the villian turned into a vicious serial killer simply because his wife left him while he was on steroids. The cops in this book were comical characatures whose detective and interview skills matched that of a 10 year old. Mr. Woods should read a Michael Connelly novel before he tries writing cop scenes again. Woods is hit or miss and this was one of Woods' worst books. Stick with Chiefs and White Cargo. I read this book based on the reviews posted here and I was really, really disappointed."
4,Good Read,"It had a few slow spots, but all-in-all it was very entertaining. There are several things going on at one time, such as the ""crazy ex"" and a mystery surrounding the twins that caught me off guard. I will definitely try other books by this author."
1,Held hostage by boredom and predictability,"Where do I begin? The sample was deliciously enticing, but once I purchased the book it went quickly downhill. The characters were insipid and the women were incredibly weak. After all Liz had been through do we really believe she would fall right into bed with Keir. Also the racism was sickening slave quarters, uneducated black people on the island, the usage of colored? Really? In a 21st Century novel. Anyway, this is my first and definitely last book by this author!"
1,PALINDROME,READING STEWART WOODS BOOKS HAS BEEN A PLEASURE TILL THIS ONE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE.
2,Read Chief's by Stuart Woods instead.,"I can't imagine anyone giving this book 5 stars, or even 4 for that matter. The plots were unbelievable. The characters were unbelievable. The writing was mediocre at best. I found the book to be a waste of time. I did finish it, thinking it would get better, but it never did. No one gets away with murder so easily, and it insulted my intelligence. No one runs around in a Tarzan suit either. Give me a break. Read Chief's instead by Stuart Woods."
4,Very interesting book,I enjoyed reading this book. I have read and enjoyed many of Sturat Woods's books and will continue to do so.
4,Hazard's secret mission,"In a deviation from the previous three volumes of this series, Hazard is involved in a secret mission in the Crimea (don't fret readers, this info is on the back cover and doesn't divulge content). As with the previous three, Stuart has continued to develop an interesting character in Hazard. They're all worth reading, and going through the out of print search process to obtain."
2,Bad... real bad....,i had to bought 2 set of this to come up with 2 sata cables :S because 2 came uselless.
2,didn't work,"This did not work for me at all. I even paired it with borage oil, but I did not see any changes."
1,MINUPULATION AND LIES,"THE AUTHORS OF THIS BOOK WANT TO CONTROL YOUNG ADULTS THROUGH LIES AND MINPULATION. IF YOU WANT TO RAISE YOUR CHILDREN TO HAVE FAITH IN THE DIVINE AND IN THEMSELVES -DO NOT LET THEM READ THIS BOOK. IT IS FULL OF LIES AND HALF-TRUTHS! DON'T BE SCARED OF THE DEMONS IN THIS BOOK, BE SCARED OF THE AUTHORS"
5,Great! Very eye-opening,"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. I really enjoyed this book. It was great. It really opened my eyes to what is out there. lt really gave me a sense of campassion for those who are struggling with the many problems delt with in the book, like: the occult, teen pregnancy, depression, drugs, spiritual warfare, and many more. The fact that it showed everyone's different views on the issues were really good. The letters between the demons were also very riveting. Though, they were very frequent and the amount of them could have been cut in half. Despite that small fault, this was by far a GREAT book. I recommend it to everyone (over the age of 14 would be prefferable)"
5,The greatest rat of all time (and the greatest book too)!,"Montague Mad-Rat is a rat born to a family he is ashamed of, he goes on a jorney to save all of rat kind!On his quest he meets many unforgetable characters, and uncovers the secret of his long lost uncle who's name has tortured Montague all his life. This is my absolute favorite book, I have read it three times. It is wonderful! If you enjoy this book, you will enjoy ""The Wainscot Weasle"" another book by the same author also about a determined little creature. If I could give this book more than five stars, believe me I would!"
5,Accepting oneself,"Monty is an insecure rat, insecure because he and his family live in a sewer and create works of art, which is frowned on by the higher class society of wharf rats. Additionally he shares his name with his Uncle Moony, a drunken creator of decorated rings, which shames him because of the derision of the other rats. An interest in the pretty Isabel and a crisis helps him to overcome his insecurity and his shame. I bought this book because I'd just acquired 2 pet rats, and ended up hooked on Tor Seidler. He truly cares about his characters, and while the stories are for children, they aren't childish. Adults with a little imagination will enjoy his animal stories as much as the kids do."
4,A superb book from the rat's point of view!,"I really enjoyed this book. It tells howMontague saves the rats in New York from extermination Montague paints sea-shells and sells them so that his fellow rats on the wharf are left alone--and he manages, in the process, to win the heart of Isabel Moberly-Rat. Isabel's father doesn't care about the shells that Montague paints, but Isabel encourages Montague to sell them for their good cause. A fun book which will appeal to all ages, but especially grades 3-5. I am nine-year old boy and I think people who liked Stuart Little would like this book"
3,"cute, but inaccurate. great to read to young kids, though","i have rescued pet rats for well over 10 years now, and read a lot of rat fiction. the movie, ratatoullie, for instance, accurately depicted much of a rat's behavior. this book doesn't, but it's still cute for kids."
5,Informative and inspirational,"Luke Timothy Johnson's book is much more than a commentary on the Creed and its history. It is an inspiring reflection on the meaning of the words we have memorized. Once you read this book, you will never again simply recite the Creed by rote. You will know what you are saying, why you are saying it, and how deeply and succinctly it captures our faith. If I could afford to do so, I would give a copy to everyone who goes through RCIA."
4,Uneven but sharp and concise primer and apology,"Maybe 3 and a half stars.Luke Timothy Johnson is a moderately conservative neo-orthodox Roman Catholic. A world-class Biblcial scholar teaching at (liberal Methodist) Emory.There are some VERY outstanding new books on the Creed: Alister McGrath's I Believe; Van Harn, ed., Exploring and Proclaiming The Apostles' Creed [2004]; Michael Horton, We Believe, and the last section of David Matzko McCarthy, The Good Life [2004]. If I bought just two, one would be Johnson's. McGrath and Horton's works are certainly more orthodox in spots. (For example, 'born of the Virgin Mary': Horton and McGrath believe that the Creed is right on that, while Johnson strongly hedges.) But Johnson makes up for shaky orthodoxy in style, precision, and clarity.His introduction is the best part of the book. His defense of creeds, against Modernity on one hand and Anabaptists on the other, is alone worth the $10. Pleasant cover and packaging too."
1,Poor Combo,"This unit is easy to hook up and has a decent picture.However it is difficult to operate as it locks in DVD play mode and will not recognize the VCR feature. So basically it is only a DVD player. The remote is small so the buttons are difficult to use and the unit responds very slowly to commands. It does not have a skip forward feature. Only a very slow moving fast forward which operates similar to what you get when you fast forward a VCR with the tape playing. It also has trouble reading some of the newer DVDs.The unit comes with the Progressive Scan feature turned off and the menu will not allow you to turn it on.The manual is poorly written along the lines of a generic manual that could apply to any VCR, DVD, or Combo. It does not even troubleshoot the problem of switching from DVD to VCR mode.Not worth the money even at the new discounted price as other mfg's have similarly priced units with much better features and function."
3,Its ok but with a few drawbacks,"Pausing while recording a TV show causes the tape to go back 2 seconds. So when you unpause you lose 2 seconds of the show before it went to commercial. As far as not being able skip forward its not too bad because the ""play mode"" or ""info"" buttons bring up an on-screen menu which from there you can go back or skip forward a chapter or two. The remote is small but I hardly use it because I have a full size universal remote that came with my TV."
3,Actual product was not what was pictured,"Pictured reflex hammer had a pin to hold the rubber head in place. Actual hammer received did not have the pin. I would not have ordered if I knew it did not have the pin to hold the head in place. Otherwise timely shipping, good quality."
2,Cheap quality,"Cheap quality, but you can't beat the price. If your office/clinic hammers tend to 'walk off', then this is a good buy."
4,EAR CANKER POWDER FOR DOGS,"Works as advertised. My dogs swim in ponds, that can lead to constant shaking of head and digging of ears. After a few applications, the digging and shaking stopped. Great product!"
1,Does Not Work in Adirondacks,"Just got back from a trip to the Adirondacks / Lake Colden. I watched this product fail twice in one night-- the bears can now, evidently, routinely open these. The black ones (Garcias) still work--at least I saw two that did--albeit with several nice bite marks. If you are going to the Adirondacks or somewhere else with lots of bears who are smart, don't use this product or you'll be hiking back after your first night."
3,MEW JAZZ ARTIST TOO ME,LAST WEEK FROM MY LOCAL LIBRARY I GOT THIS CD OUT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE JAZZ ARTIST BEFORE I GOT THE CD OUT ON THE TITTLES OF THE SONGS ALONEI WAS VERY SAD TO LEARN OF UNTIMELY DEATH AT THE AGE OF 52 OF MS.McCORKLE MY MOST LISTENED TO TRACKS MORE THEN ONCE ARE IN THIS ORDER1-I'D RATHER LEAD A BAND2-LOVE AND THE WEATHER4-HEAT WAVE7-THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS13-LET YOURSELF GO8-CHEEK TO CHEEKTHE ENTIRE CD IS GREAT BUT THESE ARE BY FAR MY FAVORITESYOU ALSO NEED TO GET OTHER CD's MY SUSANNAH
5,Great product,"Bought it for mom and she loves it. She wears that around the house and keeps her feet warm, and it's not slippery on tile floor. They don't have another on sales with my size, otherwise I will buy several and stock that up for life time."
5,Better than wicked good slippers,"I really wanted to buy my mother-in-law a pair of the very expensive wicked good slippers by another ""name brand"" but couldn't believe how closely these resembled them. I was able to buy her a pair,& myself a pair, both for less than half of one of the other brand were with shipping and guess what, they are just like the other brand. They are exactly what I expected, no, even better than i expected. Thank you. I Recommend!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not one of her best,"I've read all of Jackie Calhoun's books and like her work, but this isn't one of her best. It's almost as if she wasn't sure what she wanted to do with this story. It's about Sarah and Fran who have lived together for five years, but Sarah is restless. Sarah moves out to go looking for whatever it is she thinks she needs, which appears, for a while at least, to be a lot of fishing. Fran is devastated, but distracted by having to care for her mother who is deteriorating with Alzheimer's. Fran is also entangled with the straight estranged wife of a man she works with who is violent. Sarah is being pursued by another woman and finds herself living with two gay men. These men don't make any sense at all. I guess it's a pretty good look at the mundane lives of even gay people, but I never felt drawn into the story like I have with other books by this author."
5,Celine is truly an angel sent from Heaven!!!!!,You have not fully seen her talent until you see her in concert. She is unbelievable! The true meaning of an entertainer and the voice of an angel. Her voice will steal your heart. If you have not seen her yet. What are you waiting for?
5,Only thing better is Celine 1999,Celine has developed the power of love over her fans and it even is very apparent on video. If you watch this and are not moved and caught up in the vacuum of Celine live then you are simply not alive.
5,Just let me tell you....,"...I was there in Memphis, and I can't wait to have my own copy of this show. If the video is as good as Celine was live, then it will be well-worth the wait!"
4,Great ensemble work and solos,"Among the plethora of releases Rob McConnell now has to his credit this is one of my favorites. While McConnell's compositions and arrangements are always a treat, this particular selection of tunes as well as the soloists complement each other better than most of McConnell's previous albums. Alto saxophonist John Johnson's solo on ""Invitation"" is first rate - worth purchasing for its own sake. If you are a fan of big band music and/or Rob McConnell this is recommended listening."
5,"Fantastic book, big impact on my eating habits and my life!! If you eat, you should read this.","This is a wonderful book by nutrition expert Marion Nestle. Reading it really change my life. The information within this book really opened my mind to what is really happening, not just what I learned in undergraduate university nutrition classes.Please read this. Borrow from the library if necessary, but I purchased it and highlighted so many great thoughts so I could show others.If you read any book about health or nutrition, make this the one. (Then read the China Study, by T.Colin Campbell)"
5,"Very Informative, So much information... VERY Interesting","I had no idea about the politics behind food, Its a great resource and the information is Life Changing. Read the book ""Plenty - Eating Locally on the 100 Mile Diet"" by J.B. Mackinnon, Brilliant Addition!"
5,Marion Nestle's a true scholarly hero!,"Marion Nestle has walked onto the stage of public discourse and claimed a great victory for scholarship with her heroic effort, Food Politics. Her argument is clear, concise, devastatingly accurate, and--most important--based on first-rate research. Bravo! Her courageous book does exactly what its title indicates--she provides the details on how the food industry, especially the large corporations, may provide economies of scale in producing food for general consumption, but that also, in its rush to compete in the marketplace, seduces us all, especially our children, into eating more than we need. The excellence of her approach and, yes, her metadiscourse as well, has much to instruct a wide range of people on effective ways to present argumentation on any issue."
4,The other side of the food inustry...,"A good read! All you thought you knew about the food industry but didn't want to believe. It contains very apparent, detailed accounts of how big money food conglomerates steer legislation and deregulation of the food industry and marketplace to sell you processed junk in healthy packages. If you believe the food industry is researching products in your best interest, to make food safer and genuinely more nutritious, read this book! The book, along with a few others pertaining to similar topics, restores some bit of hope that there are indeed a few people out there that value good food and nutrition, and are wise to the fact that good nutrition doesn't come in glossy cellophane packages stamped with health claims touting unbelievable `magic bullet' statements targeted to those with limited understanding of nutrition and health."
5,The truth shall set you free...,"This is an engrossing and important book, and the more people who read it, the better Americans' health as a whole will be. People don't understand the enormous power the food industry wields, much like the tobacco industry, and how little accountability it has for the products it sells. The health effects of those products are only beginning to be known, as are the dirty little secrets behind how animals are raised and the antibiotics, hormones and, yes, pesticides that they are treated with. This book goes a long way to diseminating this important information."
3,Good information in a dull format,"Marion Nestle has a lot of useful and important information in this book; however, her style is very clinical and mundane. I found myself working to stay awake whenever I read the book. I did finish it, because I think it's good knowledge to have, but a better writer could have made the material pop."
4,Interesting,"Had to read this for a college class on Consumer Science. None the less, this is actually disturbing and eye-opening about the industry. You can really see many of the examples that she points out in current time.If you enjoy nutrition, food or health, this is something to put on your reading list."
1,"Don't bother - looks cool on box, but never got to make it","Just like others here on Amazon, I tried this out with my children and the solution dried WAY before it said it would. Essentially, I got 5% of the mixture into the mold and then the whole mess dried in the bowl.If you bought this, all I can recommend is - try twice the water amount in hopes of keeping this more liquidy in hopes of it not drying in 2 minutes. Also, half the mixing time -- 1 minute is all you got in my opinion.Left my kids dissappointed and me grumbling over the hour of cleanup."
1,"Sounds like fun, but leaves you hanging","I bought this volcano kit for my 8 year old son. We were really excited to put it together. We carefully read the directions and quickly mixed up the volcano mix (directions read you have 1-2 minutes before it sets up). As soon as I added the water, the mix began to set up which made it impossible to pour into the mold. We ended up with a crumbly mess and no volcano. Needless to say, my son was very disappointed. I'm pretty good at following directions, but this set up so fast it was ridiculous.[...] Save your money."
1,Volcano review,This was very disappointing. It did not erupt - it barely fizzled. I added 12 of the tablets and couldn't get it to do anything. I would NOT suggest to anyone!
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE - Don't waste your money,"How much fun is this? I think I'd rather wrestle a crocodile. We didn't even get past the building the volcano. The cement solidifies within seconds of the water hitting it, so you can forget about even getting it into the mold. And the mold itself feels like it'll break if you look at it. We'll try playing with the fizzy tabs later, but that will be after I make a traditional salt-dough volcano. My 9yro was EXTREMELY disappointed that his birthday present was a complete flop."
1,Absolutely Horrible!! Wish I could give zero stars,"Just rotten, my niece was incredibly disappointed. Just no way to get it poured before it sets. Horrendous waste of money & so disappointing for the kids."
4,HE WILL,"THIS MAN MUST DIE (Que la Bte Meure) is a movie written and directed by French director Claude Chabrol in 1969. The film is about the revenge of a father looking for the hit-and-run driver who's killed his only son.It's a pleasure to rediscover these Claude Chabrol movies of the late sixties-early seventies period. Often despised by those who swear only by the name of Franois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard when speaking of the french New Wave, Claude Chabrol deserves our utmost respect. Each of his films is the acid description of a slice, in the Balzacian meaning of the word, of the french society of his time.Chabrol is an admirable storyteller with a caustic and perceptive mind. His actors and actresses don't have much to say, their behaviours and silences replacing for the best unnecessary lines of dialogs.A DVD zone ""tell me a story""."
5,Representing the top of the watchmakers art.,"Do not expect to find quartz electronic watches from the orient here. This is a catalog of the finest in traditional watch design from Europe, primarily Switzerland, Germany and France. Here are watches that are the ultimate in design, both mechanically and artistically. They are also the ultimate in price, intended for the well to do who wants to make a fashion statement that is also a supurb timekeeper. (I don't know the most expensive watch in the book, but the highest priced one I found was $783,100.)The book is organized by manufacturer and gives the highlights of their current product line. It is profusely illustrated with color photographs on virtually every page. Of course not every watch of every manufacturer could be included on a book of any size. But then again, that's what the web is for."
2,A limited value catalogue,"In an annual catalogue of watches I would expectt to see all the models produced in the world in that year, either gents or ladies, expensive ones or poor man watch.But here you won't definitely find them.Here you will see ONLY expensive European gents watches. And not even the Grand Seiko. Is it a watch catalogue? No, it is only pure advertising. The worse one."
5,Great Reference,"A wonderful resource book, exhaustive coverage of big and small wristwatch producers. This is a commercial book and all company's are written about favorably (not reality). One is best to research products/reviews online in addition to get a true picture of the products represented in this book. This is the best in my opinion of the watch annual books.The strengths are: clear listing of all watch specs, often interesting blurb about each company, pronunciation list, company contact info, additional resource list (forums, dealers, etc.). Annual does not change that much yearly, might try buying last years annual and saving about 50% for very similar content.Enjoy this wonderfully rich subject."
4,Finnish Folklore,"If you're interested in Finnish Folklore, this book is a good place to start. It gives more of a general overview of many topics in folklore. If you're interesyed in more specific details about the areas discussed (such as different ethnic groups in Finland, historical agrarian society, legends, folktales, riddles and jokes to name a few) then you might be some what disappointed. There are quite a few examples of different genres of folklore and they were actually collected in Finland. The examples are given both in Finnish and in English.The organization of the book is confusing at times, and some topics are discussed are listed in the reference section even though there is very little information on that page."
4,exactly as described,"easy to use, fast, with a flexible tip. I believe the readings where accurate and the beeping was a nice signal of fever before you even looked at the thing. And the flexible tip also comes in handy when you're doing underarm temp taking.... I hate doing a rectal one, but this makes me feel like I'm not being totally invasive. :)"
1,Incomprehensible,I do not understand why anyone would put so much effort into writing a book that will be understood by so few people. This book is incomprehensible to all but a handful of philosophers. Repeated inventions of new terms and phrases only further obscures the message of the writer. The claim that the author presents a compromise position between deflationsim and the correspondence theory is ludicrous since they are mutually exclusive theories of truth. Of no value in the study of the nature of truth.
3,It's a joy to watch someone do anything with this degree of excellence,"Some of these champion baggers seem socially awkward until you we meet their friends and families and discover how much more adept and confident these folks are than the people around them. Most of us probably dismiss grocery bagging as a skill but really, it's a joy to watch someone do anything with this degree of excellence."
1,Obstructs view,"Well, it definitely keeps the light out...but the driver can't see through it very well at all. This product is a driving hazard."
2,a bit of a disappointment,I bought it for my little granddaughters who were bored by the old movies - in many Shirley only had a minor part.
5,Shirley Temple - Everyone's Little Princess,great dvd collection. everyone should have this collection. i got them for my little girl (she looks like Shirley temple)and she loves watching them.
2,I'm confused...,"As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service, I am confused about this book: there is a book in my possession entitled ""The Story of the Secret Service"" by FERDINAND KUHN, with a foreward by then-Secret Service Chief U.E. Baughman...is THIS the same book (and is KUHN a penname for NEAL)? The book I have was published in 1957 by Random House. However, when I ordered it here, I received not the 1971 ""Neal"" book with the same title, but this one...? That aside, this book is o.k.; no great shakes. It's very dry and dated. For the curious only."
2,Gitanjali By Rabindranath Tagore,"It reflects the innermost feelings of one's heart. There is no comparison to the expression of his feelings in words. It feels like I too wanted to say the same, only I did not have the words!"
5,Masterson's Update,"In this wonderful book, Dr. Masterson updates his groundbreaking work on the treatment of the Disorders of the Self (personality disorders). In his deceptively simple and straightfoward style Dr. Masterson gets to the essence of the personality disorders and their treatment. This is a must read for anyone who is treating personality disorders."
4,User-friendly introduction to Masterson's work,"As a beginning student of object relations theory, I found Masterson's latest work to be accessible, challenging, and clinically useful in terms of conceptualizing the often subtle nuances of disorders of the self. Highly recommend!"
5,Bowling shoes worth wearing,"Now, I'm no expert on bowling shoes. The only ones I had ever worn were the rentals at the alley, but I bought these and they are super comfortable and lightweight. Believe it or not, they actually helped me improve my bowling game because I have better control now. They seem to run true to size because I bought my usual 7 1/2 and they fit like there custom made."
1,GTA will not run,GTA installs but will not work. The error message had me contact SecuROM Support to fix the .exe file. I have had 6+ email exchanges with SecuROM with several exchanges of exe file analysis and new .exe files. It still does not work !!!
4,video quality,"I don't know if it is just my copy of this DVD but does anyone else notice pauses in the taping. Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be and I am such a die hard Bon Jovi fan, it's O.K.I was just wondering if anyone else noticed, and I should try ordering a different copy (mine looks brand new and was stated as such) or just enjoy for what it is????"
4,Oh for the Love of Jon...,"I love anything Jon Bon Jovi, and I love this DVD to! In my opinion ""Live from London"" is not as good at the ""Crush"" concert DVD, but it's a great video to add to your collection. Enjoy!"
5,Bon Jovi,"What else is there to say? They're the greatest band on earth. my only reservation is that DVD's are made to hold MORE space, I don't understand why they didn't include so many more songs from this show. ""Dry County"", ""Bed of Roses"", ""These Days"" are all great concert songs and should have been included among many others. I also plead with the company that a DVD of their final Wembley Shows may be produced. Why not?"
4,This is a swingin' fun jazz guitar album,"I'm a jazz guitarist and avid collector of jazz guitar recordings. There are a lot of jazz guitar albums that you buy that are good, but never really speak to you enough to get multiple plays. Somehow, this one was one I kept going back to. The spirit and mood is fun and swinging. You get the feeling that Herb and Joe really liked each other, but they weren't going to sit back, idly, and let the other one top them. It's spirited great jazz guitar, with wonderful interplay, that I think most fans of the genre will thoroughly enjoy."
2,Birds won't use it,The idea behind this feeder is brilliant but for some reason the finches and smaller birds will not use it. Anyone have any suggestions?
3,DUNE BUGGIES AND BIKERS,"This old biker B-movie was obviously made for the drive-ins of yesteryear. It had an improbable plot but viewing the old dune buggies and classic motorcycles were worth seeing while you waited for the movie to end. Some of the riding and spin-outs were excellent - the acting mediocre at best (Casey Kasem, Dovie Beams, Robert Dix, etc.). It is good to know that movies have improved immensely, even the newer cheaply-made biker movies with the leathers and tough talk. The music was good and some of the bar scenes interesting. It is likely well on the way to becoming a cult classic."
1,Disappointing,I thought this was going to be something COMPLETELY different than what it is.... The lady isn't even that hot and how is she getting facials? It wasn't at all what i thought it would be.
3,Japanese for Busy People : The Video Guide,"The Japanese for Busy People books are an excellent tuition series. This is a pair of videos that cover some of the lessons in the JBP volume 1 book. It makes an attempt at humour and explains key points carefully.However, it is rather disappointing. The presentation of the video is very amateurish and its tone is patronising. In general, it is reminiscent of a slightly excruciating work training video and it really isn't long enough to achieve very much. It isn't as good as the books."
2,Soft backing pad is concave,"The backing pad that came with my Bosch 1295DVS random orbit sander is of ""soft"" hardness. This backing pad is concave. It only sands using the outer ring of the sanding disc. I'm refinishing the oak treads on a set of steps and can only sand about 4 treads before I have to replace the sandpaper disc. If the backing pad was flat, the sandpaper disks would last a lot longer. I really like the sander itself, so I just purchased the backing pad with a ""hard"" hardness rating. I'll let you know how this works out.Feb 5, 2011 - The ""hard"" pad is better, but is still a bit concave. The edges of the sanding pads wear out first, even when I'm careful not to go over the edges of the boards and the boards are first jointed flat. Concave is better than convex for sure, but flat is best for sanding flat surfaces - someone should clue the Bosche engineers into this."
3,Good tips,"This little book had some pretty good tips about dealing with the ""political"" plays that all are often victims of in an office setting. Well worth it for the section of countering these types of attacks. Wish there were more examples."
3,Dreamship needs a few more friends,Dreamship surprise is a killer song with a nice groove and the addition of both an extended version and insturmental make it a nice addition to your bootsy collection but at nearly $10 it's a pretty pricey addition that you can forgo...if you have everything else from the funk master and need a fix it's a neat ride but with only three tracks it's a bit hard to lay down the cash.
1,Dreamship Surprise,"I was rather disappointed when I received my product. I thought I had ordered a dvd and instead a received a cd. Not only that, I received 2 and paid for 2. Since I was paying in Australian dollars - I knew it would cost more with the changeover so I assumed that's why. Now I have two products I didn't really want. I guess I should have read more carefully - I don't think I will risk ordering this way again."
5,"Quick transaction, best price",Simply the best. Product arrived quickly. I have yet to install it but there should be no problem
3,Best thing is the title,"I was inspired by past reviews and the great title to order this book. I was disappointed, and, sadly, have to agree at least in part with the critic from Rochester MN. Whether this book appeals to you may depend ultimately on what you think of as gardening, or, perhaps, what you think of as ""Ground."" This is a book with suggestions on how to make your garden more usable by filling it with stuff--tables, pots, statues, etc. My own idea of gardening is filling it with plants."
2,Dramatic solutions--absolutely--and not much else,"This book may appeal to a small niche audience: folks with sub-urban homes in planned communities who have a great deal of money and want ""instant beauty."" No doubt, the pictures are lovely and the spaces shown have been creatively transformed, but I found the examples out of reach for one with a mortal-size wallet. The authors have suggestions in getting around CC&R's in planned communities, which are helpful. However, this book seems to be a portfolio of Glassman's work, rather than a plantsman's book. In an early edition I had, the index was non-existent and some of the plant labeling was incorrect. The title held such promise (good job, editor!), but the book failed to do its job."
2,Upper-incomers only,"This book has great ideas, but they are focused toward upper-class homes and people. I found nothing that would enhance a middle-class home."
3,Great Garden Design Ideas,Excellent value! This book gives fabulous gardening ideas that are affordable and easy to maintain for busy individuals. Highly recommended.
3,A bit heavy handed,"I have to give Loren credit for speaking his mind so freely, but he lost credibility with me by taking jabs at Nicholas Sparks and his fan base. Not that Mr. Sparks is Hemingway, but he does sell a lot of books and does ""something"" right with his book writing. Loren's tone was sometimes aloof and it just didn't sit well with me. Some good advice throughout I suppose, but only if you are from Loren's school of thought on what it takes to be a good writer. I think writing about so many tough guys has gone to his head."
3,Hardcore 80s fans only,This CD is really only interesting for die hard fans over this genre since it doesn`t really contain any real good songs and the production isn`t all that great either. Not bad but just OK and nothing more.
1,Look elsewhere,"I was looking for a book that would describe the HTML language and more importantly discuss writing CGI programs that interact with HTML. This book was not what I needed.A simple search of the 16-page index shows the problems. There are no entries for 'cookies' or 'refresh' (as in client-side pull refresh), and the FORM HTML tag has a total of 3 pages referenced (hardly enough room to describe how to write forms). So if you're looking for detailed technical material, this isn't the book for you.This book is useful as a broad-reaching primer about the internet, newsgroups, VMRL and many other obscure (and outdated) topics. But I think you would still do better elsewhere."
2,Definitely consider a different book...,"For a book that is supposed to be about HTML and CGI, this book spends most of the time talking about everythign BUT HTML and CGI. In fact, if you want to find a discussion of HTML and CGI in this book, you'll have to go lookiing for it.I think the only reason this book sells is because people confuse this horrible book (HTML & CGI Unleashed) with a good book (HTML, Java, CGI, VRML, SGML Web Publishing Unleashed)."
1,Lame,"After leafing through this book, I assumed the author must be about 60 years old. The ""insights"" he makes about what is hip seem to require about that much distance from youth. This is a cliched look at youth and trends."
1,stupid and dull NOT genius,"Gee, i'll tell all my friends to write reviews for me and call me a genius when my book comes out. That's it!Come on....I can't believe a publisher actually took on this writer....he stinks!The book is stupid everyone....don't buy it. Don't buy the next book either....it's all mean. Let's all ask Josh what makes him so cool?"
3,"Nicely written, but misses the mark.........","This book is an interesting read, or at least partially interesting anyway. But it is seriously flawed. For one thing, it includes profiles of non-hipsters or scenesters (which are close, but not the same) and lumps them in with hipsters.For example: A Raver is NOT a hipster. They are Scenesters. A Goth is a Non-Hipster. Hipsters wouldnt be caught dead with Goths, and vice versa. A true Hipster remains deep and philosophical, yet shallow and savvy enough to know where they belong. "" Euro Trash"" are Non-Hipsters are well, as are ""Ex-Frats"". There is nothing more Un-Hipster than belonging to a fraternity, even if it was in the past tense. And furthemore, it uses cliches which arent quite that funny. If you want a far MORE ACCURATE discription of the true Hipsters and their psyche, buy ""Hipster Handbook""."
1,God awful,Clearly a compilations of clinches and stereotypes from someone who has never interacted with those he has decided to describe or poke fun at. Potentially could have been hilarious but the author didn't have the chops to make it so.
5,blazingly witty!,"This book is blazingly witty, hilarious,and informative!I have to frequently use a field guidefor my job, so i had to laugh outloud when i first noticedhow much Aiello's book is set up in ""field guide format"",complete with illustrations & a Latin species subtitle...onlyyou don't need to take a year in the deadlanguage to understand Latin!Aiello & Shultz have uncanny skill - this is a must buy!"
5,GLROTW (geeklife.com review of the week),the illustrations rule in this book. i bought it new/used for 6.30!what a steal/deal!
5,stroke his genius,"A stunningly lucid account of an under-documented, but quickly emerging field of social anthropology. Aiello and Shultz's book, while worth all the laughs, is a book to be taken seriously for its scholarship and journalistic spirit.I am interested in whether or not this will effect the hipster estabishment in a kind of 'we are on to you- so up the ante- kind of way'. Mad props."
4,Finally... The video you've been looking for!,"I know exactly what you were thinking when you bought ""Something Smells Funny."" You were hoping that it would be similar to the U.S. version of the show, only a little more outrageous. While ""Something Smells Funny"" turned out to be a disappointment for many, ""Tonsil Hockey"" is not. The segments are much better and closer to the stuff we wanted: Canadian stuff that's closer to the MTV version, but still has a flavor of its own. If you like Tom Green, this is the video to buy."
2,A Distortion of an Affluent High School Memory,"I've enjoyed all of the books that I've read by author Joyce Carol Oates, except this one. She has portrayed the angst of adolescence so beautifully in previous novels. What happened?Oates introduces the reader to fascinating people: mysterious John Reddy Heart, his luminescent mother and eccentric grandfather, but fails to flesh-out the characters, to establish deep family ties. Curiously, Heart's little brother becomes a computer industry tycoon and his pathetic little sister becomes a ""famous"" nun. If they had grown up to be less prominent citizens would that have diminished the plot?The sensuality of being ""young and restless"" was ever-present as was the loss of that vitality 30 years later at the high-school reunion. In spite of the fact that the story was episodic, disjointed, I couldn't help but wonder what was the allure of John Reddy Heart (more saint than sinner). Alas, if only the story had been told from the ""heart."""
2,boring boring boring,"why Joyce Carol Oates devoted hundreds of pages to describing John Reddy Hart's high school comrades I just don't understand. The only good part about this book was when she finally let us into John Reddy's life from his point of view. I never good a good sense of any of the characters, and i never even began to recognize who was who in the high school crowd. the book was repetative, boring, and the worst Oates book I have read to date. I loved We were The Mulvaneys, but this one left much to be desired."
2,A great writer with great technique wasted on this story,"JCO is a phenomenal writer and I look forward to her books. I suppose that is why I was so disappointed in this book. I usually can not put her books down and yet I had to struggle to finish this without intermittent napping. The story line is cloying and not particularly believable. The writing style is great JCO stuff, but somehow it was not enough to make this stimulating. I see the larger themes she wants to touch upon, but boy is it a stretch here. Who are these characters and why do I fail to care? True enough many people are damaged by adolescent experiences (real and imagined) but this story just doesn't click. I found it repetitive and dull. Great effort, but also, for me, great disappointment. JCO writes so well that you just come to expect great things. I'll shelve this error and wait for another great success(like, We were the Mulvaney's)"
2,Too much teenage angst,"This book concentrates on form and neglects content. Nothing much happens after the first few chapters except the rapid fire introduction of too many moony teenage girls. I wanted more about John Reddy himself and less about mass hysteria and adolescent angst. After teaching high school for 10 years, I couldn't suspend disbelief enough to buy that one boy could induce that much lovesickness among so many different girls."
1,incomprehensible self -indulgent bore,"This book was an absolute strain to read. Between the superfluous details and the lack of direction,what could have been an interesting tale of a controversial murder turned into a drawn out, self-indulgent borefest.It would have been a wise decision to cut out the entire third part of the book. I found myself skipping whole pages just to get through the minutiae and find the plot. Don't waste your time with this 369 page eyesore."
2,A more licentious 90210,"In a space of more than 300 pages, Oates managed to write a rather long-winded drama about a clutch of privileged high school students. The tedium of the flash forwards and backs along with the confusing gender change of the first person narrative does little to further the continuity of the unbelievable plot. While the book probes the mind of a supposed criminal while also addressing class antagonism in modern American, particularly among ""blue-blood"" families and their less noble neighbors, the dynamics of the modern dysfunctional family, and the tedium of teenage life, as evidenced by the obsession of the high school girls with John Reddy, I would not class it amongst her better works. This book clearly falls into the category of slow reading for devoted fans."
4,JCO knows suburban culture,"The history and trajectory of a privleged high school class of suburban Buffalo in the early sixties ... and their adopted bad boy, John Reddy Heart. Fascinating and tasty. Oates has such an ear and eye for U.S. culture."
4,A Mix of Pop Culture and Adolescence,"Ms. Oates drives a stake not only into pop culture, but also into our adolescent stunted society. Through the vivid detail she uses to describe and fill out what might at first seem to be the main character, John Reedy Heart, the reader might possibly get the sense that this novel is ""too simplistic"". Wait, and keep on reading. In John Reedy's classmates we are able to see the vehicle by which pop culture is created in America and view the stunted growth of the successful/not so successful adults they become. Great read for anyone but especially those particularly cynical of society."
1,A waste of time......,This book was a major disappointment. I could not wade through anymore of the tedious drivel after about 1/3 of the way into the book so I gave up. It could have been a great story if not for all the unnecessary and boring details about TOO MANY characters.
1,Dissapointment,"I really appreciated Firefox and Zombie, but since I picked up Broke Heart Blues I've been toiling through it, reading one or two pages at a time and wondering when it's going to start going somewhere. The whole plot seems to be exposed in the first few pages, and then it just goes on and on with the same story over and over again. The characters all seem completely artificial, their reactions are not believable for one minute. I'm only on page 87 and I think I will give it up completely if nothing new happens in the next five pages. Help!"
1,This is just terrible,"I ordered this movie as my intro to amazon,a cheap indie movie.Let me start by saying I have no problem with indie films,b movies,or cheap shlockers.But come on!!!This is a horror movie??I think not.You need some blood for a start.I can see a butchers knife beside someones head...is it supposed to be IN the head?who knows..you like seeing b&w tree branches with distorted voices in the background?This movie has a ton.Is a story to follow something that would interest you?Nothing to see here.Like saving money?Don't buy this dog.No more Sub Rosa movies for me....ever"
1,This is terrible,"I decided to begin my amazon dvd collection by purchasing this film(and I use that term very loosely).I have no problem with indie films,b-movies,and low budget shlockers,but this movie is just pathetic.It makes absolutely no sense.They show tree branches with inaudible noises in the background for no apperent reason other than to fill some time.There is no gore whatsoever,and if I could have given it zero stars I would have.Save your money."
1,very disappointing,"The film has some great atmosphere, spooky and isolated old house, and few truly gory scenes, but, that's all, as right through it alternates between tree brunches (pointless...!) x-ray vision of a ghost face which plays the most important role of updating the viewer with the story, and some slow-montion crap mistaken for action. Sorry. but it also gave me the impression it has finished before even started! If you are true lover of a horror movies, look elsewhere."
1,How dumb,"No matter how bad this movie was, I have to admit that it was the best Sub Rosa release I've seen. Now that I've got that out:What a terrible flick. 99% of it has no dialogue, it's just poorly filmed images that, I guess, were designed to horrify, but are more likely to make you bored out of your wits. It's 70 minutes of garbage that could have been condensed to 5 minutes of slightly more tolerable garbage, but I can only assume that this was some prissy college kid's art project that had to run for over an hour. Hopefully he flunked."
5,Classic 2-Slice Dualit Toaster,"We already own a 4-Slice Dualit toaster with the upgraded electronic controls from W-S. I added this toaster as a surprise for my wife as she has developed Celiac Disease and sharing the toaster became a difficult task. Now she has her very own toaster that will never be contaminated with wheat gluten from regular breads or bagels. The traditional controls are not as elegant as with our 4-Slice model but it has never the less performed perfectly over the past 2 1/2 months with daily-multi daily use.As you may have already guessed (in my opinion), Dualit toasters are without peer but you pay for the performance and appearance. As with anything man-made you could be unfortunate and get a lemon but my experience with both of these toasters has been nothing short of perfection. I do prefer the W-S model for the electronic controls but in the end the performance is what counts and this 2-slice model is great."
1,Not Even Close to Being Worth The money,"Other than the look, which has now been duplicate by other companies, there is absolutely no reason to buy this incredibly expensive toaster. It does not toast evenly. It does not accomodate bagels unless you flatten the bagel into a pancake with a hole in it. Everything is manual, and has to be reset every time, including how long the toast cooks, and whether you heat the elements for one slice or two. The idea that the toaster keeps your toast warmafter it's done toasting is false. The toast is barely warm, and as you'd expect once you think about it, dried out. The Dual Lit is all hype, no better functioning than a $30 toaster from Sears (or Amazon,which is the BEST place to do business in the world.)"
2,Not Worth the Money,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister 3 years ago. It was VERY difficult to spend $250 (purchased at Williams-Sonoma)on a toaster but she loved the look of it. I gave it two stars because it does look great. However, it doesn't work very well. It toasts unevenly and everything is cold--even if you are prepared with butter in hand and spread it in record time--by the time the toast hits your mouth...COLD!!!!"
2,Not worth the price...keep on shopping.,"I've had the toaster for over 5 years and have enjoyed it very much with the speed it toast and how well it evenly toast. Owners must use this item with great caution though. Bagels will need to be squished/flatten or suffer getting stuck and you spending time retrieving the item--be careful with children as they are tempted not to unplug the toaster when inserting their metal fork to retrieve their bagel. The timer will fail with no warning aside from the day you are preparing for work and the fire detectors go off. As fate would have it, the timer did not stop so the cooking continued leaving the detectors goings off and dogs barking. For a short term investment, this is a great item to have but for the long haul, keep on shopping."
1,Save Your Money,I bought this toaster because it looked great and naturally I assumed from the glowing reviews here and at Williams-Sonoma that the thing could actually toast bread -- WRONG!! I have been trying for the past year to figure out how to get a consistently toasted piece of bread out of the machine. The first try is always underdone. If you put the bread in for a second cycle it burns! And the really strange part is that it will burn the bread on one side while the other side is barely brown. Additionally I find the ticking sound annoying. I would buy the Kitchenaid Pro line instead
3,What happened???,"Tough as nails. I had one that saw tons of abuse for 14 years, finally, a heating element was torn by a kid poking a knife in. Couldn't find replacement elements to tried a Kitchaid toaster which was terrible. So bought another Daulit. Same rugged construction but the heating elements are completely different. Good part is that elements are smooth instead of squiggly, and covered with some kind of plastic--so no more worry about bad objects in the toaster. Bad part is that the design changes result in a shockingly slow cook-time and slightly uneven heating. Gets 3 stars because it will last forever. Only gets three starts because it takes so ridiculously long to cook a piece of toast."
2,Waste of $$$$,"My wife and I have lived with one of these for years. She wanted one because they're cute. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it toasts. It's reliable because everything is manual. The lever that raises the toast does not raise it straight up but racks it on an angle. So if what you're toasting is round or small, it squashes it against the front of the toaster. Make sure you get some wooden tongs with this unit. It never toasted evenly, the bottom of an English muffin would be burnt while the top was almost pure white. The side panels are clear coated aluminum or white metal. Over time corrosion occurred under the clear coating that cannot be polished or cleaned off and makes the toaster look awful. The center is chrome and can be cleaned. I couldn't wait to get rid of this thing. My grandkids could design a better toaster than the Dualit."
2,Buy a Cuisinart instead and save yourself money and aggravation,"We received the Dualit as a gift and used it for years, mostly just because it was cute. However, the thing was a bad toaster.Here is why I do not recommend the Dualit:1) It toasts but very unevenly. It should be awesome for what it costs.2) Believe it or not, the stupid dualit has a lever where the bread would always get stuck- and it didn't come up when it was done. The lever is at a diagonal, so that smaller pieces of bread inevitably get lodged there.3) The timer makes a constant annoying clicking sound. There is no ""pop"" sound whent he toast is done, because (as mentioned) there is no mechanism for this.The only reason to buy a Dualit is because it looks good on your counter. I recommend saving $200 and buying a Cuisinart."
1,NOT A GOOD TOASTER,"Of course this is a great looking toaster but every time I use it, I am reminded how much I hate it. With the high price, you'd expect it to work better. It's wide opening makes normal sliced bread widths fall down into the toaster and not able to pop up. I'm constantly unplugging it and digging the burning item out with a fork.Bagels are generally too wide for the opening and I have to shove it down and then it gets stuck and I'm once again unplugging it to force the bagel (now destroyed) out. To make two acceptable slices of toast, it usually takes at least 4 slices of bread to get it right. I've learned how to make it work with warming up and watching the toast like a hawk. When ever someone other than me uses it, since they aren't used to it, toast is burnt. This isn't how something as basic as a toaster is supposed to work."
2,Don't let the price fool you..............,"I bought this toaster for my husband. He wanted it because he read somewhere Queen Elizabethhas this same toaster. Anyway, it's expensive and makes lousy toast. The bell that ringswhen the toast is done broke not long after getting it. Now I have to unplug it to turn it off.My whole kitchen filled with smoke the other day. It's in the trash now, waiting for pick-up."
1,You've got to be kidding,"$219 for a toaster that doesn't toast well - with the added bonus of not taking big pieces of bread!?! I don't know who the bigger yahoo is - the person who thought they could foist a substandard piece of crap on the public for a fortune, or the economically irresponsible people who would buy the thing. If you really want the retro look, spend your money on an antique toaster in nice condition - it is probably built better, and you will be just one step above the Joneses who bought this overpriced waste of metal."
2,Bedtime book,"This is definitely a bedtime book because it is sooo dull and boring to read. Neither my 21 month old nor my 4 1/2 year old took any real interest in this book. Skip it and pick one of Thacher Hurd's better books like Cat's Pajamas, Zoom City, Mama Don't Allow or Moo Cow Kaboom."
4,A very informative and fun book.,"As a 1.5 generation, I really enjoyed the book. The life stories range from the 1900's immigrants to the most recent.To the authors: how about a book based on the immigrants on the eastcoast?"
3,Finish is a dull black,"You can't beat how adjustable and classic these wall lights are. However, the finish doesn't have any brass/gold highlights like the picture suggests. They are more of a dull black color, and I have resorted to painting mine to look the color I wanted. I am concerned about the 30"" of metal cord cover because we need to mount the light higher than this on our wall and I am hoping that the bare cord will not look too bad as it disappears behind our mattress."
4,"Nice looking lamps, great quality","We installed two of these with the brown finish behind our triple recliner. It was a little difficult to get the wire pulled through the metal conduit, but lubricant helped a lot. They look great. Since they are near our heads, I put in CFL bulbs to avoid heat.BTW: The fixture measures 15"" from the top of the higher arched arm to the bottom of the lowest shade. I'm a little picky, but I wish we had reversed the arms when we assembled one of the lamps so they would be mirror images."
4,"Nice map, with a couple of shortcomings","Easily readable large-scale map of Ghana. One side depicts the southern half of the country, the other side the north. I can't vouch for the entire map, but the areas I've visited appear to be accurately depicted. It could be improved on two points: First the ancient historic mosques (e.g.; the famous one in Larabanga) are not marked, either as historic sites or as mosques. Furthermore, this the first map I've ever seen that lacks any mileage information, either using a scale of miles, or by noting distances between points. But since it's marked as 1:500000 scale, the math works out to 1cm = 5km. Handy to know that."
1,Ridiculously Oversized,"Ghana is a small country. Yet this map is ridiculously oversized, with the northern half of the country on one side and the southern on the other. That makes it unnecessarily difficult to plot a trip when you can't see the entire country on one side. A country this small and mostly rural doesn't require a great deal of detail. The map covers up my whole dining table when I spread it out. For that reason it's very frustrating and hard to use.Unfortunately, you may not be able to find another Ghana map. I've been looking, and this one seems to be the only one available."
1,The shipment did not include both volumes so I can't really rate this.,"The shipment did not include both volumes so I can't really rate this.It was returned for credit.For what it is worth, I don't believe it was purposely shipped missing the second volume.Unfortunately, although I ordered the 2-volume set, I already had the first volume and needed the second - the one that was left out."
3,pretty good game,"having a handful of nancy drew computer games already, i decided to give this one a shot. the graphics aren't bad for a pc game, and i love mysteries. these are fairly quick games, so they're great for someone who doesn't have a lot of time on her hands, like me. overall, the game was fine. short, entertaining, but now i'm looking for something a bit more stimulating, maybe a bit more involved. it may take a little longer, but i'll just have to make time for it."
1,A rose by the same name is not as sweet...,"I recently bought this movie by accident, thinking it was the Rankin/Bass movie by the same name. I figured I might as well watch it anyway. It is awful. It makes very little sense. It drones on and on and is horribly boring. It has no story line to speak of. Even my 2 year old nephew didn't fancy it. There's a full 10 minutes of just sugar plums dancing. And they're wearing clothes. And it has Santa's reindeer practically starting an insurrection. This is nothing by comparison to the Rankin and Bass movie. So, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I am a Christmas movie fanatic. This is the first one ever that I didn't take to."
5,Wedding in white.,"For what was supposed to be a low budget movie, this makes for excellent viewing. This was actually filmed in an older area of Toronto and even the house it was filmed in was original. You cannot match the atmosphere any better.Excellent period authenticity with performances by all to match.The plot, incidentally, is not far fetched. Situations such as this one did in fact occur on a regular basis back then and from what I understand this movie is actually based on a true incident.Great entertainment!"
5,Very entertaining ethnoambient.,"Wow. I am the first to review this? Unbelievable cuz it is really cool. A beautiful cross between Javanese gamelan music and electrambienewage. Actually is cool as background music for getting some important work done, like planning the new millenium. Most of it is gamelam with synth kind of setting the scene.This just does not sound like it came from Baltimore. But apparently Macht spent some time far from Bawlmer, sipping some java with the Javanese."
4,A great debut in a year of many great albums,"Though The Fall would get better over the years, this stands as an excellent debut LP. The guitar sound is a tee-bit different on here because it features original guitarist Martin Bramah instead of Craig Scanlon (who would join in time for the next album ""Dragnet""). Though I seriously can't stand ""No Xmas for John Quays,"" the number of highlights on here are numerous: the speedy ""Futures and Pasts,"" the longish ""Music Scene,"" ""Two Steps Back,"" and the best song here ""Rebellious Jukebox."" Certainly, the fact that this was mastered from a vinyl copy with a couple of skips and scratches in it doesn't help, but the music overcomes that."
1,Are you serious,"Basically the worst highlight film ever. It looks like it is footage from a camcorder fixed on a tv. Yea, tremendous. No game announcers or sound bites, just a horrible narrator. He sounds like he is in a bathroom talking into a microphone. They skip lots of games and show more of the Brazilian players being losers than of France celebrating. What a phenomenal way to waste 5 bucks, pleases save your money and just live off of your memories of France 98'."
2,Might deserve a higher rating if the print was as advertised.,"The box states plainly that this film is 'letterboxed', but the print is actually full frame, and rather soft. The infuriating thing is that both the trailer and the 'photo gallery' are culled from a very sharp widescreen print. That's right: the photo gallery is made up of screen grabs from a WIDESCREEN print, to which I can only assume the makers of this DVD had access. But instead of giving it to us, we get stuck with something that looks like it was mastered from an old VHS tape.As for the film itself, it's basically the last ten minutes of 2001 A Space Odyssey stretched to 98 minutes. Having said that, even a film of marginal interest gains immeasurably from being presented in the framing intended by its director. Too bad."
4,"""Do Ya""","This is a very good dance CD!! This is a must buy for those who do not want to sit still while listening to music. ""Do Ya"" and ""What Would We Do"" are two of the many songs on here that you can't skim thru. You must listen to the entire song. ""Do Ya"" for example starts off tellin' you to ""come on"" with a solid drum beat, then it breaks into a nice little synth introduction while increasing the payload of the drums, with some nice vocal repeats, then rolls you into a piano break, then just drops the serious bass line and clear cut vocals that you can't deny. This cd will ""Do Ya!"""
5,Jimmy Bruno Live at Birdland,Best jazz guitarist alive today. Period. Excellent live album. Will send any guitarist to the woodshed for a loooooong time!
2,wonderful technician but hollow impact,I find something missing in his playing. No one can dismiss his mighty technical wizardry but his playing lacks emotional substance. For me he seems to jump aimlessly from one series of technical displays to another. The technique should be a means to an end but it seems distracting in his playing. If you want to hear fabulous technique combined with emotional impact check out Russell Malone.
5,As good as Book 1,This book continues the excellent story from Book 1 and left me eagerly anticipating Book 3.
4,Rock That's No Joke,"Say yeah!!!and I want love is filled with hooks,great guitars for anyhair metal fan.Other songs are good too.I gave this cd 4 stars cause thiswas not quite the same level as the kings of the 80's.But just as greatso if you're a die hard like me,gotta have It!!!"
5,A master storyteller!,"I've been reading Joel Lane's work for years in various horror anthologies and magazines, and this collection demonstrates why I never miss a book that he's in. Lane is one of the best, most grueling horror writers out there. Brutal, emotionally honest... sometimes erotic, and not for the weak.Fans of M. John Harrison, or Ramsey Campbell are sure to love this master of the modern horror. From the Midlands of England to the finer cities of Europe, Lane's vision of urban horror and decay with stay with you for a long time."
2,disturbing stories,"Joel Lane writes well and his descriptions are good. The stories themselves, however, are disturbing and leave one with unsettling thoughts."
3,This book was a little bit too fast-paced at some times,"This book is set after Frank and Joe's father is killed when the Hardy's are working together to uncover a poaching/smuggling ring. In this book they are trying to find their father's killers, and have found out that they relize that there may be more to his death than meets the eye. It is suspenseful, and also a little too excieting at some points. You shouldn't read this book before you read the first book in the trilogy, called Endangered Species. Also, you shouldn't read this book until you know that you can get your hands on the third book in the trilogy, which is called Operation Phoenix."
2,Mastering Hardwood Floors: An Installation Guide,"This is not a book, it is a syllabus. Very poorly illustrated with few details. Also this material is dated. Got absolutely no useful information from this."
2,Outdated,"This is a great book if you are going to do your flooring very oldschool. The book was published in 1989 and back then all of the varieties of different kinds of flooring types weren't available. This book is mainly for people that are going to nail down their floors. Also, one other point, the book is VERY cheap. The book is binded with plastic rings (like that you would expect from an old recipe book) and it appears that the pages were all copied with a cheap copy machine. All of the illustrations are hand drawn and in black in white. There is some useful information, however it is way outdated."
4,Evildead Underworld,This is a very good thrash album with many awesome riffs. The vocals are more on the hardcore side. What I mean by that is it reminds me of S.O.D. and not Iron Maiden. This should be a must have for thrash fans new or old.
1,Sounds like....,"What a mess. This album reminds me of the cheesy ""sound alike"" music that was floating around in the 70's or ""the Pixie Moondust Band"" does the best of the best of the ""Golddiggers"". Once in awhile there is a tribute album to a band. That would have been a better idea since this pap is supposed to pass for Three Dog Night. Some things are best left alone and this unfortunately is one of them. If it doesn't sound like the original, then it isn't the original. I gave it one star only because there wasn't anything lower. Stick to the original albums. At least they were that....original."
4,35th Is Purty Good,"I had my reservations about this one until I saw them ""Live"" a few weeks ago and this is almost a soundtrack to their show. I see reviews it is ""not"" the real Three Dog Night but get over it! how many bands stay original, some bandmates get booted, some die, that's life, anyway, I recommend this one because it is pretty good. Standout tracks are Liar, Out In The Country, Sault Ste Marie & One. Also includes some ""Live"" versions at end of the CD. So really, if you liked the band from the beginning, try the newer version, they sound pretty good. If you want the original members, buy a best of because these tracks are newly recorded in 2004 and sound great.Check out my site at ""Judemac Forever"" Google it say ""Hi""."
2,MEMO TO DANNY AND CORY: BRING BACK CHUCK!!!,"As a longtime fan of Three Dog Night, I have followed their career with the devotion of a true aficionado. I have bought their albums, cassettes, CDs, VHS and DVD videos. I even have their lesser-known LPs (It's a Jungle, Coming Down Your Way and An American Pastime). Need I have to say more? So it's a pity that while I am anticipating, along with a legion of other longtime fans for the REAL reunion of the original three singers of this, one of the most famous rock acts of the seventies, I and countless other doggies have to put up with another TWO DOG NIGHT production and yet another GREATEST SAME OLE GREATEST HITS collection, while we're salivating for the real thing. Lighten up, Cory and Danny. You guys have great pipes, but it's time to bury the hatchet and wipe the slate clean. Bring your prodigal son back into the fold, and make that last great album you three wonderful singers are capable of. Sadly, The Beatles lost the chance that you still have."
3,almost got it right,"OK, Cory, we all Know you can sing ""one"", and Danny you can sing ""Easy to be hard"". Hell, Chuck can sing all of your leads with no problem. The point is while the perfomances are good, there is no magic. Steve Augeri sings with Journey. It's a Great band, good singer, no magic. It's not just Chuck. It could be any combination. Chuck and Cory or Chuck and Danny. Without the original three (plus Floyd Sneed), you guys are treading water. All of you still have great voices. The real TDN fans are waiting. Let's put the past hard feelings behind. Make new music, Make new fans, Make mo' money.PS. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? What are you waiting for?"
1,Two Dog Night --Maybe,"I have to admit, like others, I bought this CD just because I was excited to have another collection of Three Dog Night songs. I was so disappointed when I played it and realized it was really only two dogs. Without Chuck, there is no Three Dog Night. They can package it the same way, call it by the same name, but it's not. These vocals are nothing more than lack luster covers of the originals, certainly not the wonderful vocals we have come to know and love. I agree with another reviewer here...why can't they listen to the words of ""Easy to be Hard"" and patch things up? If the Eagles can do it, the Dogs should be able to as well. Eager fans are waiting for some new harmony! Oh yeah, and this CD, I threw it away!"
5,Real Review,"I love this CD! I have bought, played and love this CD. By reading other reviews of this CD it seems like people have an axe to grind and haven't actually listend to it. It's great!!!If you buy it and listen to it you will absolutly love it."
5,Shame on me for loving this CD,This CD is far better than anything they have done before. The live cuts are amazing. They really show that they can play live as well with the symphony. I don't know what the fuss about Chuck Smuck is. Let sleeping dogs lie!! I LOVE IT AND SO WILL YOU!!! Don't let one former disgruntled band-mate make you miss this CD!
3,35th Anniversary Hits Collection by Three Dog Night,"The CD was brilliant great sound, please because all their best hits were included together with some new with excellent instrumental highlights."
2,Read the Description Close,"Three Dog Night was one of my favorites back in my teenage years and still is today. If you are like me you want to recapture the sounds of your youth. While this album contains many of their best works it was a huge disappointment to me. Not re-mastered as many classic albums, this one is a new recording 35 years later with different back ups. It just doesn't sound the same as the original recordings."
2,disappointed,My original brush is 15 years old and still has firm bristles. This one has very soft boars hair bristles. It does not brush through my short hair.
1,brush,"not good it only had a few bore hairs when it said 100% bore hair,at the very leastnot accurate"
1,Not soft at all,"I bought this product because I was looking for an extremely soft brush for my hair. I bought it based on the reviews and reading customers complaints about the brush being too soft. When I received the brush in the mail, it was not soft at all, it was rough for my delicate hair. I wonder if it's actually 100% boar bristle brush, it looks more like plastic."
4,Good brush for most hair types,"Many people already know that natural boar hair can be the best kind of brush for your hair. Ace makes the best one as far as I'm concerned. I love this brush, and have yet to find one better. I just wish it was a tad stiffer."
4,Time Stops for No Mouse by Patricia,"From what I have read from this book, I think that it is interesting because it is telling a part of a mouse's life. I enjoy fiction books and sometimes when I read a part of a fiction book, I want to read more to know what will happen.In this story you can see different types of attitudes or ways of being. This might help people because when they grow they ask themselves why are people this way or that way and sometimes end up following the wrong way to act.I think this book is an expectacular book even though long."
3,Not the Best Out There,"Time stops for no mouse actually doesn't follow much of a story line so it had me confused basicly throughout the entire book. I think this book should be for ages 13 and up because if i was confused by it, a Kindergartener to a sixth grader would definitly pick up this book thinking it's good and get through the first 10-15 pages of it and bring it back to the library unfinished."
4,"Really Good, but too many characters","This was a really good book. The only bad thing about it was that it had so many characters, it was hard to keep track. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had read it straight through, but I read a few books at a time. During the climax, I couldn't put it down. By the way, I'm a 13 year old girl."
1,Not as shown in picture,As usual Amazon did a great job of getting this order to me in record time...However the product is not Maroon.....It is awful gaudy pink...the inlay is cheap gold that flakes and leaves a mess everywhere....I would return it however the item only cost $3.95 and the shipping is too much.....:(
5,Great lipstick holder,"I had looked all over for a lipstick holder, as I had one years ago and it was wearing out. A lot of people looked at me with puzzlement. They had no idea what I was talking about. I then searched on my computer and found this website. It was great. The holder was a lot better than I expected and it was shipped fast. I would go there again to purchase other items."
5,The Best John lee Hooker album ever!,"This John Lee Hooker album,it my opinion is his best overall single album,featuring new renditions of some of his best songs ""Boogie Chillums"", ""Hobo Blues"", ""Crawling Kingsnake"" mixed with some nice soulful full band arrangements without losing that great solo Hooker feel. Some of these particular versions wound up on the orginal ""Blues Brothers"" movie soundtrack! A Great introduction for peopel new to John Lee and an essential collection for the hardcore John Lee Hooker Fan like me!"
4,"Pretty neat, pretty neat, pretty great, pretty great","The recording isn't all that swell but the music still comes in super-awesome. Check out ""Romeo's Distress."""
5,Greatest car magazine evar!,"Grassroots Motorsports is everyman's car magazine. Its written by real car enthusiasts, not some conglomo corporate staff that cowtows to vendors in their articles. If its a great value, it has 4 wheels and is a blast to drive, they'll tell you about it and how to make it better. Who else would have a magazine-sponsored Challenge with a limit of $2000 for each vehicle? Grassroots Motorsports, that's who."
2,More advertising than anything else,I bought this magazine based on reviews but found it contained more advertising than anything else.Very few articles of any technical content.
1,Review on Magazine,To the best of my knowledge magazine has not yet been delivered to recipient. Can give review once delivery does happen.Marianne
1,Great glasses! But Not Happy with Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I only gave it 1 star because they sent me the WRong Color ( Orange ) but I ordered Pink. They ran out of stock so I was stuck with the Orange. I was very upset with Amazon but had to keep the item.
5,trip the lite fantastic,"i cannot say enough words to adequately praise this recording. it was recommended to me by a friend and it takes me to new places whenever i listen to it. it is soft and unobtrusive, but changes the texture of the brain in subtle and amazing ways. works well as a soundtrack to an intimate dinner or a dance party weekend. i'm not a big fan of electronic music but i listen to this album over and over."
5,A New Benny?,"When I first heard Peplowski (Peps) on the CD with Charlie Bird I said ""this could be a new Benny."" Now after hearing a Good Reed I must say he is better than Benny (with all due respect Sir). MAYBE Benny could have cut the marvelous and definitely classical Homage Concerto, MAYBE. But could Benny also have blown the luscious tenor cuts? I rest my case. -An engineer and long time reedman wannabe"
3,Useful but limited and not well organized,"Provides some valuable observations and direction for a novice, but describes the author's experience with his particular lawn located in Florida, making it less useful for a different climate. Also, some information is needlessly repeated on different pages and not well organized. Good to wake you up, give you good ideas and and get you thinking in the right direction, but don't expect to find everything you might need."
5,Love this tea!,I drink several cups a day to help with digestion. I never get tired of the flavor - has a good ginger bite to it.
5,Character driven,"Han Nolan is a master of characterization. As you read DANCING ON THE EDGE, you find yourself inside the mind of a girl tetering on the edge of insanity. Through Nolan's genius you identify with Miracle McCloy and the insane seems logical. Children learn the ditty, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me."" This book lays bare that lie. Words are important in the life of a child. Identity is largely based on what a child is told about themselves at a young age. I highly recommend DANCING ON THE EDGE to young adults and adults as well."
4,Good book about people with serious problems,"I couldn't help but feel sorry for Miracle McCloy. This book is interesting and easy and fun to read.This book is about Miracle McCloy, who is very seriously emotionally disturbed. Miracle's father, whom she calls Dane, seemingly 'disappears' one night. Miracle and her grandmother, Gigi, decide that he 'melted' and Miracle begins to think that he went back in time to bring back Miracle's deceased mother. Many events, including Gigi and Miracle moving to Granddaddy Opal's home, Miracle finally taking the dance lessons she has always wanted and a big tornado that hits Opal's house and changes Miracle's life, and her outlook on it.The characters in this book are well-explained and are loveable in their flaws and odd quirks. I believe that Miracle's story is one that I will continue to stay with me in the future. Worth reading. I reccomend it.~Atalanta"
4,Very Good Young Adult Book,"I thought Dancing On The Edge was a very good book even though I found it to be an easy read. This book did an excellent job showing how families keep secrets from each other and the ramifications this can have on the individuals and the family as a whole. It got across a very good point that ""people see what they want to see and don't see what they don't want to see.""The main character of this book, Miracle, was on a search not only for her father but also for truth, the truth about her and her family, which was hidden from her for so many years. One of the other characters in the book says to Miracle, ""They're the truest, realest thing I know. You need that, I think. You're like me. You need the truth."" She is absolutely right about what Miracle need in order to be happy."
4,Not your typical young adult novel ...,"The story of how selfish and bickering adults and their lies nearly destroy a girl's life. She was taken from the womb of her dead mother, and she believes that her missing father ""melted away"". Her world is one of guilt and illusions. She descends into insanity and sets herself on fire in an attempt to communicate with her missing father. Only after being placed in an institution does she begin to recover."
4,Miracle is a miracle,"Han Nolen has created a beautiful yet somehow chilling story of a girl, Miracle, who lives in a world where every number, every color has a meaning and where you can speak to the dead through seances and predict the future. She is starting to wake up and realize that not many other people are like her. She is baffled and offended to find out that the world she lives in is not real, but a fraud built to please. This book really changed me and the way I look at things. It is truly beautiful, but I would not reccomend it to those who are either confused by or just don't appretiate some deepness. This book makes you think. It makes you delve into the depths of your mind and discover some things not just about Miracle, but about yourself too. This is a very uplifting novel. The only reason there is a missing star is because this book temporarily shatters any love you may possess for fantasy. (notice temporarily) I would suggest this book to anyone who think they're ready for it."
5,its all about me,"This book is one of my favorite books and it brings a touch of reality that every writer hopes to accomplish. I can immediately relate to the story because I've gone through it too. Every page was captivating, with emotion, laughter and joy in every word. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a story that will touch their lives."
3,This is not the best book that I've read.,"This book is a book that mystery readers might enjoy. The plot is a little awkward. Miracle and her family are a little strange. If I had read more books like this, when I was younger, I might have enjoyed it a little bit more, and understood it a little better."
4,This is one book that will wrap you up in it's story!,"This is an intriguing story of a young girl's struggle to find out about her past, who she is, and about her family. It will envelope you in it's intensity. Definately a good book!"
5,Reader from Texas*,Dancing on the Edge is such a wonderful book it only took me one day to finish it. Usually you wouldnt find me reading a book but who could resist this amazing one. I am a dancer and that is what attracted me to to this paperback novel. I now Lve to read books written by the author of this book and trust me there great.*
5,Adds a Nice Touch to the Kitchen,I got this because my dishes were too large for my cabinets. I didn't realize how nice they would look on display in the kitchen versus being hidden behind doors. I would advise measuring your plates in comparison to the spokes on the holder so you know how they're going to fit/look in it. Not all plates will look 'normal' and some won't fit properly.
3,cute idea,Cute idea but on the ash grey tshirt it came off looking a little cheaper than I had hoped.
2,voice overs ruin it,"The live concert disc is good because there is no voice over. However the rest is terrible. If they would have left the dj voice off this set would be a Hendrix staple because the outtakes and rarirties are phenomenal. Includes the rare 'Valley's of Neptune' song which is a locked away Hendrix masterpiece. On this version though you have about 25 seconds ruined by a dj voice. Almost the holy grail, but not quite."
5,One of the all-time great Christmas albums,"This is one of the all-time great Christmas albums. It is to jazz Christmas albums what Sinatra's ""Songs for Swingin' Lovers"" is to pop vocal albums. Scott Hamilton seldom disappoints. He delivers once again with ""Christmas Love Song."" There is nothing approaching a weak cut on the CD. My particular favorite is ""Little Drummer Boy."""
3,"Well, at least it had ex-Ar.FL/NFLE star Kurtis Eugene Warner on the cover!","A long copiously documented NFL stats book that'is released annually, but no info on the otherPro leagues, the CFL, Arena 1 or NFL Europa.Contains all you mihgt want to know about theNFL Coaches, Players, Teams, but since the NFLis only my third favourite league, a bit toopricey. Good effort by the NFL staff, but notcomplete."
4,Quite good,It sure as hell ain't a spectacular movie but it's quite good.The acting is here and there but the movie is watchable which says a lot of the movies nowadays which don't have nothing attractive enough to scare you. Prom Night doesn't scare a whole lot but it's a good movie at least.
3,Predictable,"Where's all the (fake) blood after all that dicing of human obstacles? Did you notice that the hands and knife of serial killer Robert Fenton are sparkling clean most of the time? The only exception was when he washed it under tap water. OK, fine, credits to him for at least being able to hold his weapon properly, most of the time.This movie is about a male teacher who falls in love with his blonde female student and goes into a killing spree in order to be with her. He whacks her family, gets caught, goes to jail, breaks out of jail and goes to her prom. There is a lot of potential in this movie but it's just not thrilling enough. Events are so predictable, even its ending."
1,Ridiculous!,"Why doesn't he just kidnap her in the suite at the beginning instead of killing umpteen people for no reason in particular, and attracting attention to himself in the process?Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the killer just isn't scary or interesting at all. In fact, he looks bored during the Lisa character's chase scene.The original Prom Night also had a large cast but managed to develop most of the characters at least somewhat. This movie has tons of throwaway characters like the gym teacher, the psychologist, and Chrissy (Lisa's rival for prom queen) -- who could be made interesting, but are instead introduced and then abandoned.Obviously most horror films aren't intended to be high cinematic art, but the good ones at least keep your attention.This ""film"" is an insult to Prom Night '80!"
1,Skip This Prom....You'll be glad!,"This movie was a dud! A complete waste of time and money.Growing up as a kid we sat around the tv and during the holiday on channel 11 was the Yule log.I thought it was the end of the world as I knew it.Wrong! This was! Yes sorry folks but I will stick with the Jamie Lee Curtis one ..Thank you! That one you don't find out the killers identy until the end.This one you know and he is not menacing just irratating as hell.Everyone goes by old pictures of the guy with a beard but hey he could shave it off.Its goofy and sluggish with your typical dopey kids getting ready for college.I'll miss you says one girl to her friend,I'll only be a half hour away replies the other.My god no one I graduated with was only a half hour away at college.....Five states away yes and Thank god for small favors.Psst You might want to get a bag clip for the nose and ear plugs the movie stinks and so does the soundtrack!"
2,Glad I didn't buy this,After reading some Amazon reviews on this movie that it wasn't any good I went and rented it cause I like some movies others don't. Well I have to agree with others on here. This movie wasn't as good as the trailers made it out to be. It just didnt have the wow I was expecting. Before you buy this movie rent it first to ensure you don't waste your money if you don't like it.
4,Prom Night (Unrated),"For some reason, I really enjoyed this one. I love scary movies, but this one isn't that scary. I think I just love the plot of the movie. It's funny and spooky-n-creepy. I think this one had potential to be an excellent movie, but it was just one of those movies you can't take serious. In the end, it's a typical teen horror movie. But it was good to me."
1,"It was, you know, like totally horrible, right?","This movie was on Starz OnDemand this month, so when I was up at 4AM this morning with nothing better to do, I thought, what the hell? After all, I kind of like cheesy teen slasher movies, Prom Night is sure to be right up my alley.Eh. Not so much. None of the characters are interesting, the bad guy isn't scary, the plot doesn't make a load of sense, and the writing was shoddy.A huge disappointment, even from someone who loves laughing at the bad, the worse, and the downright pathetic."
1,Dull and Predictable,"This film pulls out every cliche from the slasher movie playbook. Every scene was utterly predictable. Not a scare in sight. It was excruciatingly boring. In fact, it was rather amusing (and familiar) to watch a killer go from being very proficient at butchering several teenagers in the first hour and then becoming inexplicably and hopelessly inept at killing the protagonist - a lonely teenage girl. A note to horror directors: Watch all the slasher-movies, see what has been done before and then try come up with something a bit more ORIGINAL. Is it too much to ask?"
3,This movie is not a remake and wasn't meant to be... plz read on,"If you watched the special from the director you would know that it was never meant to be a remake of the orginal movies prom. Infact it was mean to be more reality based. It was not the best flick I ever saw but I did enjoy it. I agree with the director some movies are more scary when they are more realistic because it puts in the matter ""Hey this could really happen"". The actors were good and its a suspense film not a horor film. I do believe that if people would have read the back of the box of the movie they would not have been disappointed because it says its a thriller and for a thriller and suspense it did its job."
1,Ultimate fail,"As if we haven't seen anything like this before. It had a pretty OK plot for a film that revolves around teenagers, but it really can't hold it's own as a good horror movie, if that's what you wanna call it. The beginning is creepy, and then it just moves into the creepy suspense of just waiting for that one person to get killed, because the only extreme suspense is when you're just sitting there watching a teenager alone in a room, obviously about to get killed, and it takes forever for the killer to come out and kill them, so that's what makes the suspense come alive. The ending is OK, but altogether it really fails and it's not worth watching again. It's not the worst horror movie I've seen (Leeches is the ultimate worst), but it's pretty bad."
3,could've been better,"this movie was pretty good.. but they could've done a lot better with the script.. i was expecting it to be a movie i could cuddle up on the couch with my fiancée and watch but, it just wasn't that scary"
2,There's nothing to see here,"Whoever did the poster art for this movie should get an award. It is far and away the best part of this movie. The lead actress and the detective were pretty good in their roles, but the movie has zero tension and the bad guy is particularly unscary."
1,PREDICTABLE.,"THE PSYCHO ESCAPED JAIL,AND WENT RIGHT TO THE SCHOOL ON PROM NIGHT.HE DISGUISED HIMSELF.THE POLLICE FOUND OUT HE ESCAPED AND PUT POLICE AROUND THE EXITS AND ENTRANCES AND ALL OTHER DOORS.THE PSYCHO'S ALREADY IN THE SCHOOL.HE SCRATCHED HIS CARD ON PURPOSE TO GET THE MAID TO GET HIM IN A ROOM.HE ASKED FOR TOWELS.WHEN THE MAID WAS READY TO LEAVE-HE STABBED HER.CLARE WENT INTO THE GIRLS OWN ROOM BECAUSE OF AN ARGUEMENT SHE HAD WITH HER BOYFRIEND-SHE GETS STABBED.THEN LATER,HER BOYFRIEND LOOKS FOR HER-HE GETS STABBED.SO ON AND SO ON AND SO ON.THIS WAS A VERY BORING MOVIE.NO SUSPENSE BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE PSYCHO'S GOING TO DO AND HOW HE DOES IT.THERE'S NOTHING TO THIS MOVIE.NO EXCITEMENT.THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO THIS MOVIE TO GET ANY EMOTION GOING.SHOULD NEVER HAD BEEN MADE."
1,Yawn night,"How many ways can I diss this movie?1. Very predictable storyline.2. Packed to the rim with horror movie cliches.3. Unlikeable teenagers doing dumb things that put their lives in danger.4. Girls so jumpy that you can fart and have them running for the hills.5. The killer is revealed very early in the film taking way all suspense.6. The killer is not scary and is could easily be a heartthrob for teenage girls.7. Uses the ""boo"" technique ineffectively and excessively.8. Uneven pacing.9. Brainless script.10. You get the drift. This movie is just pathetic in its execution and is going to set back horror films 100 years. If you want a real horror flick watch The Cat In The Hat(2003). Its scarier than anything you'll ever see in this by-the-numbers slasher flick."
1,Waste of time and money for everyone involved...,"Like a previous reviewer mentioned, I too was horribly embarrassed I went to see this. It was truly painful to sit through. The original was no classic, but it was entertaining and had a sense of mystery to it. This didn't have anything going for it. Bad script, bad acting, bad everything. As far as the worst remakes of recent years go, this and Black Christmas are tops. At least Black Christmas was rated R so it wasn't sugar coated to target a younger audience like this one. The best remakes so far have been The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. Perhaps if remakes like Black Christmas and Prom Night had fallen into better hands, they would have been more enjoyable. Don't waste your time and money here. Buy the original for 6.99. You get to see Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Neilsen cut a rug to some groovy disco music which is worth the price alone. Otherwise, skip the prom and stay home."
1,You know the point in scary movies where...,"...somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? well this was a 90 minutes movie of stupidness. Honestly, I found myself yelling at the screen saying ""don't go back there"". Truthfully this was a pointless movie, predictable in every way, and the characters were just too stupid to survive."
1,PROM NIGHT SHOULD BE MORE MEMORABLE THAN THIS!,"OK, let's start off by saying this movie blows! It's a slick looking film with no tension and even the jolt scares don't work! The cast is surprisingly good, considering how stupid this film is. This makes the original look like 'The Exorcist'! When will Hollywood learn?......never as long as people will pay to see such garbage! Stay away!"
1,Pointless Excercise in Boredom,"I can't find any good points to this remake, primarily because of its bland script. Also, the direction brings nothing visually or thematically interesting to light. The cast isn't bad, and the cinematography and lighting are clearly professional, but (like the Black Christmas remake) there are no improvements on the original. The lead finds herself facing off with the baddie twice, but learns nothing and responds no differently the second time. In fact, she has to be saved - this is actually a retrogression, as with the Halloween remake, where the lead similarly doesn't modulate her reactions in any way. In both cases, the original had a stronger and more lifelike female. I doubt this will even develop a cult following, like the not-so-great original with its scarifying disco soundtrack. I say avoid it."
1,this should be PROM NIGHT V. not no remake.,this should be a fifth installment not no remake. everybody know that the original prom night was about revenge. a boy witness his sister got killed by 4 kids in a banddet bulding. six years has past. he gonna killed them at the prom. this is about an obsessed teacher killed this girl familys went to prison 3 years has past he some how got out and stll trying to get with her. it not scary it like a nick show. i rather watch prom night 3.it maybe funny but lease it got more killing in it.
1,HELL TO THE NO!,"I just watched this horrible film tonight for the first time and I HAD to get on here and give it 1 star. This was SUCH a wasted opportunity. The original Prom Night is MILES superior than this sanitized, high gloss, MTVesque, BORING and so incredibly UNSCARY version. There was absolute ZERO suspense in this. They literally show the killer's face from the beginning, so there is absolutely no point in the movie when he was feared by the audience. This was a HORRIBLE movie, avoid at ALL costs!"
4,Better than I expected,"When I first watched this movie I was expecting it to be a typical slasher movie where all the stupid teenagers smoke pot and have sex all over the place and get killed off one by one. Yes, most of them were killed, but it seemed classier than most ""slasher"" movies.I actually liked this movie. Sure I may no longer be of the age to attend prom, but I think we can all relive our teenage years through this (though most of us weren't stalked by a psycho). Some of it seemed like a stretch, but that's generally how it works in horror movies.I would also like to state for the record that a movie doesn't have to be extremely bloody and gory to be considered a horror movie. I prefer a lot less gore and more suspense, so therefore I was very pleasantly surprised by this. It was suspenseful and felt pretty realistic in many ways."
3,Well......,"Even though my proms sucked they weren't as bad as this one. The actual prom scenes were really good. I mean who wouldn't have wanted a prom that looks like that? If mine had then I would have hated them less.But when it comes down to gore, blood and a slasher flick this is worse than my proms. There's relatively little blood, which is different, and I believe done on purpose. You know who the killer is from nearly jump street. Doesn't leave much to the imagination. He kills with a purpose, but I think he killed one too many people.I was a bit put of by the fact that the interaction between him and Donna was surprisingly little. The killer is a psycho and I was left wondering what he saw in her that made him go crazy like that.Overall it's an ok film. Maybe one I should have waited until it was on the .99 shelf at my local store, but what's done is done."
4,Prom Night Gone To A Nightmare!!!,"I just saw the whole movie of Prom Night on to YouTube. I thought that Prom Night was a Pretty Scary I've seen in a tlong time of the other Horrors that I've seen. I sthis teacher at Donna's school that he was obsessed with her and he killed her family,some of her friends and her boyfriend so he can get to her. I thought that it sucked that Lisa,Bobby,Claire and Micheal died. I was thinking that Crissy Lynn is that Spoiled Snob should've died she got on my nerves during the whole movie with her snobby selfish attitude. When I saw the part of the movie when Lisa and Ronnie went in to the Hotel Room to be alone that they we're making out abit and when Lisa left the room to warn Donna that Mr.Fenton is at the Hotel I saw that Ronnie was holding a ring in his hand I was like saying that an engagement ring he was going to propose to Lisa.This is not that bad of a Horror Movie. I wouldn't mind owning it on DVD!!!"
2,"Where's the cheesy tiara, snot scene?","Wow. This had to be the most un-thrilling horror movie I've ever seen. Everyone is killed the exact same way. There is little to no tension in most of the scenes. No gore. Snore. Good points: I liked the slow to fast motion during some of the killing scenes. And the main girl was almost a two-dimensional character. Story centers around a girl whose parents were killed by one of her obsessed teachers. He escapes prison 7 years later and cops try to catch the killer before the killer gets to the girl during prom. Big negative: No cheesy tiara scene. Could use more runny mascara/snot scenes too. If you're looking for a cheesy, funny, prom-gore-fest - this movie is not your top choice."
4,More Than This.......,More than this you cannot ask for Sivuca and his band displayed a joy for preforming that one rarely finds these day.Borders are easily overcome the band plays American music in every sense of the word.Latin music in my opinion mirrors the best of what we in the northern part of America have to offer...just listen to Sivuca do Bill Withers tune.
5,awesome.,"Item came as described. Was very pleased that inside the dvd case, both dvds were individually packaged in envelopes and secured firmly. I cannot tell you how many times I've gotten loose damaged discs in an unopened package. Not this time!"
3,Relaxing Cd,I think that this Cd is very relaxing. I am a ballet dancer and I like to do stretches to this Cd.
4,GREAT MIX FOR MUSIC LOVERS,"This album ROCKS...plus it delivers a variety for every music lover...Every time I listen, I find something new about each song...Eddie's great voice quality is consistent while each song varies in it's type. My favorite songs, I have played over and over- Isis, Lights, Blues # 5, Trapezoid, It's All About Love, and Escape- just GROW ON YOU!...A GREAT LISTEN!"
3,AN EARLY HISS FILLED RECORDING,"This would be a five star album if the quality were there, I also bought his other P-Vine recordings (Push & Blowin' Smoke), Push has the best sound quality. Blowin' Smoke also has poor sound quality, the music overall is excellent on all three cd's. Some people can overlook the quality but the price is another story. (EXPENSIVE)"
3,"Smokey Wilson - Sings The Blues (P-Vine Japan, 2003)","This Japanese release captures Smokey Wilson at his best. Very good selection of songs (both covers and originals), Smokey's down to earth guitar playing, deep bluesy voice and perfect band makes this album distinctive among thousands of others.Starting with ""Blues For Big Town"" through Muddy Waters' ""Honey Bee"" to ""You Shadowed My Dreams"", from standard blues songs to boogier ones or more lyrical compositions, you'll never have a second to focus on something else except music. Fascinating, may I say.Good album to get acquainted with original bluesman. This is mature Wilson!pastblues.com"
2,Ho-Hum,"My nearly 7 year old boy enjoyed watching this movie, but he didn't laugh out loud once. In the very beginning of the movie, there is more film coverage of the adults than of Dennis which my son found uninteresting of course. We bought the double feature of this DVD and he LOVED the Special Edition film with Walter Matthau much, much better. He laughed out loud throughout THAT entire film. Therefore, I'd recommend skipping this version and go for the Special Edition film instead."
4,Who is the criminal here?,"This classic written by Anthony Berkeley is worth reading. It was written in 1937, and since Mr. Berkely was the writer who arguably issued in the Golden Age of detection writing, it's worth it just for that reason. But the book is better than just that. It gives the reader an insight into the British judicial system, and Mr. Berkeley spares no punches when he writes about the people in this honoured institution. The entire book is written with ""tongue-in-cheek"", and he handles it masterfully. Mr. Todhunter is no OJ Simspon, but the parallels between the two cases are actually quite dramatic."
4,beautiful!,"Elizabeth Bishop's poems are amazing! very tought provoking. Buy this book if you're a fan of Elizabeth Bishop, you wont regret it. it's well worth your money!"
5,Adorable,Baby Looney Tunes is a cute show that children and parents alike can't help but like. This dvd is a great addition to any collection.
4,Baby Looney Tunes not that bad...,"I have been recording them from the TV and my 2 yr old loves them. Both my husband and I find them to be entertaining enough to watch with her, as well as teaching good lessons. (What is a time-out for? Jokes at the expense of others is mean. Telling tall tales is not the way to impress your friends ...) I could go on and on. However, I have personally found Bugs to be the most irritating of the bunch. The voice character acting leaves a lot to be desired, and grates on my nerves.From a recent episode, it seems that the baby's are really about 4-5 years old also, so I don't know why they have them running about in diapers at different times. The same goes for eating in high chairs with bibs. The series is either very free with jumping back and forth between ages, or noone can decide what age the babies really are supposed to be.Regards,-Tammie"
3,Baby Looney Tunes,"I gave this to my[..] son for Easter and he loved it. I don't know how many times he has watched it, but it's cute and entertaining."
1,Pure unadulterated garbage,"These cartoons are an abomination to the classic looney tunes. Buy the looney tunes golden collection in October. If these are the cartoons that you love support it! these baby cartoons insult not only children, but the adults who grew up on the classics. They are oversweet and sickening."
3,Put a new spin on things,"I really enjoyed this book. Of course there are going to be a few odd looks when others see you reading a book on Serial Killers. But once I started to tell people what I had read, I ended up with a line of people wanting to borrow it after I was done. Morrison's tales of her experiences with these men is very insightful. You get to see how these killers are outside of the media spectacle. This has made me want to know more about serial killers; what makes them tick; are they products of their upbringing, or is there something they were born with. She goes farther into each killer more than other books I have seen. If you have an open mind, and want to know more about these people, I would highly recommended this book."
4,My life among the serial killers,Recieved in a very timely manner. Book in good condition just as I was told. Very pleased would use this seller again
4,GREAT CRIME BOOK.!!!,"If you like real crime drama, this is definately the book. Ms Morrison recreates the chilling crimes within each killer making you almost feel like you are there. This is a book that is hard to put down."
1,Pathetic attempt to sell books by using 'serial killer' in the title,"Her 'life' among the serial killers? Her life is among children and she will occasionally go get to visit the lesser known serial killers. What a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the 'serial killer' phenomenon...and to advance her own silly theories. Oh, and her *epiphany* that serial killers are addicted to killing? DUH! I think I figured that out when I was about 17 and had just begun studying serial killers.Do NOT waste your money.If you want a real expert, watch Dr. Michael Stone on ""Most Evil"""
2,Disappointing,"A very intriguing title, but a very disappointing read. Dr. Morrison, having spent a great deal of her life interviewing serial killers, comes to no concrete conclusions in my opinion. After having read the book, I was left just as curious about the inner workings of the violent criminal's mind. The book provides little in the way of explanation of the behaviors. It provides some description of crimes that I found interesting (i.e. some of the Gacy killings, etc.); however, the author asserts that she has unraveled mysteries for which she has no substantial evidence thereof. She's very proud of her career and accomplishments and it shows. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the limited conclusions offered in the book."
1,Do NOT Bother!!,"This book was so bad that it could not even be considered laughable. I eventually had to just quit reading after it became that there is no way the author is an educated professional )let alone a published forensic psychiatrist). To be honest, I was a short way into the book before I bean to wonder if the author was even a high scool graduate. I am not a psychiatrist, but even as a layman I was able to determine that 'Ms Morrison' (if that *IS* her real name), has managed to learn a smattering of psychological/psychiatric terms but has no real grasp of their meaning...Save your money"
2,keep looking,I am just completing this book and it was surprisingly filled with sweeping statements that do not ring true.There is very little insight about the killers to be found in this book.The interviews and letters are dull and lacking in information.The one interesting thing I learned from the book was that both Gacy and anotherserial killer had Klinefelters syndrome. So now I have saved you the trouble ofpurchasing and reading it.
3,A decent read,"When I heard about this book I had great expectations for it, however I was somewhat dissapointed. Don't get me wrong there are some good facts about the serial killers, but there are many annoying things as well. For example, she uses many Freudian theories which have never been proved in well controlled experiments, she talks about hypnotyzing a serial killer to find out details about a murder--a practice controversial at best. But for me the most annoying were her constant comments on areas of her life that had little or nothing to do with the serial killer of the respective chapter. Go to the library for this book, don't buy it."
3,Just okay,"This book is good, don't get me wrong. However, the reader has to get through the author continuous complaining about her not being treated fairly in the workplace. She should have saved that for another book instead of trying to get her digs in here and there. She basically comes across with a poor me attitude. Her situation is once in a lifetime. She should have tried to profile these killers better. Instead of being insightful, it is just a quick read. She certainly can't top John Douglas."
1,Serial Garbage,"I wish I could rate this waste of time 0 stars. Talk about an ego, wow! I own/have read about 1000 true crime books and I must say this is the absolute worst read I have ever undertaken. Anyone who disagrees with the author is a boob or trying to steal her theory. He self righteousness aside, the book is poorly written and edited. And boy does she have an ego!! She offers her ""help"" in the Green River killings case, is told the authorities are ""not interested"" and what does she do??? She trots off to Seattle to ""dig around anyway"". Don't even consider reading this book let alone purchasing it."
1,Absolute garbage,"I have lost count of the number of books I've read, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. This is undoubtedly the worst true crime/ forensic science book I've read. It is absolute garbage. Dr Morrison seems to spend much of the book dismissing other forensic expert's opinions as bunk, yet I have been unable to find a single forensic psychiatric article authored by her on Medline. She offers no scientific proof for her opinions and her 'poor me', 'victimised' whingeing is deplorable. Don't buy this book, read Ressler instead ... he's egocentric, but undoubtedly an acknowledged expert in the field."
1,The worst book I have read in years,"I read a lot, but this is really one of the worst books I have ever read.- I know as much as I did prior to reading it- She is so full of herself it is sickening- Huge part of the book talks about her thanksgiving hostess skills ( i did not buy the book for this)1 star is the lowest i can give but a -5 would be a much better opinion. Don't buy the book it is a waste of money"
1,Horrible !,"I agree with the other reviewer that said she couldn't finish this book. Neither could I. Helen Morrison is self-serving and drifts off topic often. There are much better books out there by much better writers with substance - try ""The Unknown Darkness"" by Gregg O. McCrary -- a real FBI Profiler."
1,Sickness bag needed,"This book was poorly written. It repeated itself numerous times. Dr. Morrison acts as though the world, including cops, are against her. They say psychologists enter the field due to their own personal issues, and this book shows that. She bashes the police, detectives, correctional officers, and FBI in nearly every chapter. If you interview as poorly as you wote this book, I wouldn't want you on my investigation either. Book is poor, don't waste your money. If you are looking for a well written book about serial killers, read ""Alone with the Devil."""
2,Drones on and on,"Disjointed and unorganized, this book was torture to read. Morrison's anthology is more of a loose collection of garrulous reminiscences of Morrison's contact with various serial killers.Once I realized that the format of the book was uncompromising and admittedly uncreative, I found little motivation to continue past page 250 or so. What little insight there is to be gained, is to be received well before that point.Moreover, Morrison drones on and on and on and on, interspersing her analyses and WAY too much personal information between characterizations. This is a very long and tedious read after page 250, and I feel a little bit stiffed.This isn't a book so much as a reference manual, and should be treated as such. However, with no index to speak of, its use as such would be unnecessarily tedious. **/*****."
2,Disappointing,"Too much time glorifying the gory details of the crimes, and little time spent developing a scientific theorem. I quit reading it half way through when it became clear that it was not going to get any better."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"This may be the worst book Ive ever read. Ultra liberal cop hater blames police for everything. She seems to admire Gacy & the other animals while constantly complaining about the police. She sits in a room and interviews these killers and thinks she is so smart nothing can happen. She actually complains about the correctional officers that are keeping her from being ripped apart. What a moron. Dont waste the postage on this garbage, the book is worth nothing. - Randy Tarburton (Retired Crime Scene Investigator)"
1,Serial rubbish,"This is the third worst book I have had the misfortune to read. The worst was 'Swamp Thing' by Peter Tremain and was the only book left to read whilst on a particularly dull Greek holiday. That said this is factually wrong 'Myra Hinkley' is mentioned at one point, and this 'M.D.' constantly bemoans the fact she is a woman as some sort of excuse for under performing. I was so angry at the lack of objectivity, accuracy or literary integrity that I was going to write a snotty letter to the publishers, but they would probably have published it as some sort of new art form if their previous editorial judgements are anything to go by. Only even consider this if you are some sort of literature masochist. If you want a copy you can have mine, it's an embarrassment to my library."
1,Didn't like it,I do not recommend this book. There were a few interesting facts thrown in here and there about the SK's profiled but otherwise it was not informative.
4,arrogant?,"this book is called ""my life with the serial killers"" not ""serial killer facts"". you paid to read her outlook and insight on the killers mentioned, which includes some of her personal life. try to keep that in mind."
2,Substance Poorly Presented,"This book offers real insights into the minds of serial killers, what motivates them, what triggers them, and how they see themselves. There are some nuggets here that may help law enforcement officials identify or profile serial killers, if they can overlook the irritating arrogance and perceived self-importance of the presentation.The book is not well written, despite being authored by a highly educated medical doctor who teamed with a talented writer. It's natural to ask why is this so. Is it possible the arrogance that flows through the book carried through the writing process, that the writer was forced to be merely a scrivener. The book has that sort of feel to it, and if so, that's a shame. Because there is substance to this book. It's just too much a shame one has to wade through so much of the how great I am packaging to get to it."
5,Helps baby's nerves,"Valerian has been used for centuries world-wide to calm those sleepless little ones, so we thought we would give it a try. In only one night it helped our baby calm down enough to transition into sleep without any crying - a blessed relief - as sometimes absolutely nothing would work (no amount of breastfeeding, soothing, rocking, et cetera). I only wish it would last until 4:45am - now that would be truly amazing."
2,Valerian Super Calm did not work for my kids,I have an over active 7 year old to whom I gave this a few times and it did nothing. It was almost as if I had given her water!
2,Not like regular valerian....,"This doesn't have the same effect on kids as the regular Valerian has on adults. My daughter is 21 months old and it barely did anything to her the first time she took it, and the second time and there after it didn't do anything."
2,Yucky taste,Melatonin dissolving tabs work much better. This stuff smells and tastes foul and it needs to be mixed with juice or something else to get a child to take it. But then you have to make sure the kid drinks the whole cup of juice. Melatonin tabs are easier.
1,didnt have the affect i was looking for.,"I have a very active child, takes her hours to settle down. I tried it with her, more than once, hoping that it would help her sleep at night. She goes to bed at 730 and doesn't fall asleep until sometimes 10/11 and wakes up at 6/7 the next day. She was obviously more active after giving it to her. I did not change her routine or anything."
3,Ineffective for my child,"We have used other herbal/homeopathic meds before and have had some success with them, this one did not work for our child. It seemed to have the opposite effect (more agitated & aggresive)and he disliked the flavor. We believe that he wasn't acting out to keep from taking it because he asked to have some to ""help him be good"" after we stopped because of our perceived results. We are now trying a prescription drug and it seems to have helped some.Bottom line - It was worth a try to avoid prescription drugs."
3,Haven't seen a difference yet...,"I've used this several nights before my son goes to bed, but I haven't seen a noticeable difference in calming him. I know some herbal supplements take a few weeks before any changes are effected, so I may have to update this. But as of yet (about a week's use), I don't think it's calming him down much more than our normal night routine does."
5,A must have,"I have been using this for my daughter since she was about 2 (she is 4 1/2 now). It works wonders when she is over stimulated, super upset, had a nightmare, etc. She likes the taste and smell and it has a very soothing effect on her. Does not work on all kids, but does the trick for her. I have been spending $15 and up for a 1 oz bottle, so this is a great price."
3,Supplement your study for this one,"Having recently passed exam 70-310 I believe this book does a satisfactory job of exposing us to the basic concepts required for the exam. Unfortunately, basic concepts are not enough for 70-310. During my month of preparation, I found I had to refer to both MSDN and ""Microsoft .NET Distributed Applications"" (ISBN 0735619336) for more elaborate explanations and working examples (some of the Sybex sample code did not work, and no errata appeared to be available on-line).Bottom line: if you plan to use this book to prepare for 70-310, then be prepared to supplement your studies with additional resources."
2,"Holds solid waste, but NOT odors!","We took the Kit on a 3 day kayak trip.One use was enough for me!The storage bag did not leak liquid or ""solids"".I didn't check to see if it turned to a gel!But, wow, did it stink.The other boats couldn't follow me, my cargo hatch still stinks, and my wet/dry bag only smells better after a bleach dunk.Use it if you have to, but be prepared to plug your nose afterward.[Sorry no video review <:|]"
4,A five star item--but EXPENSIVE!,"I like this kit because it is HEAVY plastic and has a built in zip lock. It also has toilet tissue and wet ones included--plus it folds down to about 4"" x 4"" and is about 3"" thick--this makes it easy to store in vehicle or wherever. The only down side is the expense. You only get three bags with this kit. I suppose you could reuse it a few times--but that would be kind of gross. I will use cheap plastic bags and make my own kits in the future--but these are nice to have on hand."
1,Jack and the Beanstalk,"The kit requires a sort of stand for it to be useable, sold separately Didn't see that mentioned in the description, though I may have missed it. I wanted something to stuff in a back pack so I thought I would just return it. Apparently it is not returnable because of the nature of the item. Didn't see that in the description either. So I am out $8 and some change and have a few plastic bags to show for it. Feel like Jack and the bean stalk, but at least he ended up with a hen for his mistake."
5,The King meets the King.,"In my humble opinion, these gentlemen were the tops on their respective instruments. They play so well together,and don't ste pon each others toes. The back up groups is good,and keeps things percolating. The price is right.....what you waitng for?"
5,A Really Fair Book,"O'Ballance has it right. Unlike other American and European (not to mention Israeli) accounts on the October '73 War, Edgar was really very neutral and fair. Yes, Israel was in deep trouble from the beginning of the war till its end. While Egypt lost 500 tanks, Israel's loss of 1,000+ tanks sounds very reasonable, especially since the Syrians lost 1300-1500 tanks. Israel's loss of over 200 war planes is also very reasonable, while the Arabs lost nearly 400 aircraft. Neither was victorious nor neither was vanquished was because neither side admitted defeat, so both sides' claim of victory wasn't quite correct, but the fact stays that the Arabs fought the best of this war. I really wish that all Western references regarding this war were as just and logical...."
5,Great,I bought this movie for my son. He absolutely loves it and wants to watch it all the time. Great product.
3,A little disappointed,Received as advertised and quickly.I was a little disappointed because I was expecting a story line for a younger child..The story itself was fine just for a little older child than 3.
3,Veggie goodie,The stories are easy to follow with a great message. A little too much extra features that could take away interest from message.
2,At best an advertisement for his consulting business,"Albeit there are a handful of useful ""tricks"" to presenting before an audience in here, this book reads more like a commercial for his consulting business than anything else. The stories used to illustrate his points are trite and hardly enlightening. In one instance, he even brags about his own presentation about a military feat he accomplished, used for an inspirational talk. It reads very dry and certainly was not convincing. Perhaps Daley should stick to a live audience instead of attempting to put it down in writing. There is better material available on presentation skills--this one isn't worth the money."
5,How to get yourself out of debt..............,"Written in 1810, this frothy little farce reflects the then-current fashion for ""Turkish"" themes. The overture is fizzingly brilliant, leading to a sequence of ten numbers, only three of them arias, including two for Abu Hassan's wife, Fatime. The plot involves the machinations of Abu Hassan to get himself out of debt, with the Caliph (one of the three speaking roles) finally awarding him a thousand gold pieces. Sawallisch conducts a brilliant performance, with Nicolai Gedda in the title role pointing his music lightly, with Edda Moser vibrantly as his wife, and with Kurt Moll superb as the grasping money lender, Omar.This come with first rate sound, engineered in 1975 by an EMI-Electrola team."
1,Did not receive,"I ordered a 33311 filter, I received a 33331. Have not received the correct one as of this date.Have to pay closer attention to the number when they are pulled."
4,Black comedy fun,"So glad this film is finally getting a release. I had seen it at a festival some two years ago. Fantastic performances by Joanne Baron and most surprisingly of all Harry Hamlin (who I've never been a big fan of). Also, has Lainie Kazan of My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Beaches fame. An improv film that doesn't feel like its improved. If you like Christopher Guest type comedies you'll love this film."
2,Disappointing...not whole game.,"Bought this thinking it was the entire game. It basically just jumps around with no connection between one level and the next. It's still fun, but I'd recommend not wasting your money on this and buy the regular version or a version that includes one or more of the expansion packs."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"WAS NOT EVEN FULL GAME. ""SPECIAL EDITION"" MEANS HALF THE LEVELS. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER EVER EVER EVER."
5,You're not a true fan without it.,This video is the classic Hanson at their best. You aren't a true fan if you haven't seen this video... at least a dozen times!
5,{*HaNsOn RoCkS*},"This video is by far the BEST video ever! It's great to see them enjoying themselves and at the same time pleasing ALL their fans! But I must admit, The Road To Albertane is probably a bit better than TT&MON...but Hanson is Hanson and I LOVE them!!! :c) <<*I love Zac*>>"
5,I can't remember how many times I have seen the video,"This is the video all Hanson fans has been waiting for and you who hasn't seen it yet, go out and buy it. In this video you can realy see that Ike, Tay and Zac are good at what they are doing, you also get to know the brothers better. And YOU who isn't a hanson fan You can also go out and buy it because I'm sure you are going to change your view about hanson when you have seen this video. You who reads this have to excuse me, because I can't spell so good, you see I'm from Sweden. Hanson är bäst!!! MMMMMMMbop"
5,We love this video it rocks .,WE love this video and the way yhey taped it on tour.It was the best all my friends and WE loved it.WE love all there music and WE like how now you can acually see the way they would proform live .
3,This book will make historical revisionists squirm!,"History is written by the winners. This book is a collection of essays which present the other another and mostly forgotten side of the story regarding blacks in the South during the Civil War. Largely forgotten and often ignored by revisionists, it details the contributions of black Southerners, both slave and freemen, in the South's struggle for independence. Through their own words, this book examines not only what contributions were made, but the reasons for them."
4,"History's little ""SURPRISE""!","When the South put down the gun they picked up the pen and have aquitted themselves handsomely in the ensuing years. This little book is an eyepopping surprise especially in the face of so much recent revisionist, politically correct ""history"". Blacks served willingly and honorably in the Confederate army. They appied for and received Confederate pensions. This volume is a ""must have"". This is a compelling volume of the most significant new research in 50 years."
3,"Yes, they do exist!","Nothing is so upsetting to a liberal as the idea that Blacks willingly supported the Confederacy. It assails their preconceived notions about slavery and their assumptions about how Blacks should think and act. They simply cannot accept the idea that some slaves and many freemen willingly supported the CSA and many served in its' armies. The fallback position is that they were not soldiers as they lacked weapons being only cooks, teamsters or body servants. The same group will accord soldier status to a man who drove the Red Ball in WWII but not a teamster driving a wagon for the AoNV.This book takes a very close look at Black Confederates, proves that they do exist, and shows how much information was never recorded. The sad part of their story is that it is untold. This is a vital book for anyone interested in the subject."
3,Martins Deserves Better,"I bought this CD set because I fell in love with Martins recording of the same on the In Sync label years ago. Unfortunately, the Concord recordings are much more conservative, lacking in the expressive, artistic brilliance of the In Sync recordings. This recording seems to make me a little depressed because the colour is just not there. I wish the In Sync recording would be reissued - it's brilliant."
1,Avoid Martins for Bach,"Why Martins embarked on his Bach recording quest is to many a mystery. Where Joao can be brilliant on Lizt, he fails miserably with Bach. He is trying to add more dynamics Bach's keyboard works, but it merely makes things nervous and garbles the polyphony - although one would think the effect would be the opposite. I cannot recommend any of Martin's Bach works, although he plays the Concerti reasonably well as it matches more his style of playing. Glenn Gould, Janos Janda, and Andras Schiff are much better choices for the Well-Tempered, as well as overall."
2,"Interesting, but not particularly useful","The book was an interesting read. I nice overview of a start-to-finish build of a lo-cost. The author does a good job and the results are entertaining. The book itself, too, is genearlly well written and of high quality. The publisher puts out a nice product, with high-res color photos and high quality materials.The biggest problem I had with the book was simply that I wanted more. I wanted to read much more detail and get more information than what was presented. With a title like ""How to Build..."" I expected (and wanted) more ""how-to."" Instead, the book is primarily a description of what was done, not why.All in all, the book is interesting but not particularly useful"
4,Starter Kit Assembly Walkthrough,"Keith Tanner, like most of us reading this, dreamt of building his own Lotus Seven replica. He finally bought the Tamiya 1/12 scale model and once he did, there was no turning back. Keith bought a spaceframe from Champion Motorcars, and sources a wrecked Mazda Miata for parts. He then wrote a book and set up a website to chronicle his build process.The resulting book is full of full colour photographs and insight into his project. A worthwhile book for all Lotus Seven/Caterham Seven/Replica/Kit Car enthusiasts, but bear in mind there are no drawings or plans for the spaceframe, wishbones, etc. It's more like a walkthrough of a replica build project and if you keep this in mind, it's an enjoyable read."
4,"Excellent build diary, a little light on ""how to""","I found this to be an excellent diary of one person's build of a custom sports car. It is well written and enjoyable to read, and the color photos and general production of the book are very good as well. The author tells the story of how he conceived of and built his own car, more or less step by step, and especially highlights the ups and downs of the process. A number of sidebars in the book go into more detail about technical topics, such as ""bump steer"". I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it is strong on ""diary"" and a little light on ""how to"". If you want to know ""how to"", it would be necessary to read some of the other books on this topic in conjunction with this one. Nevertheless, this book was well done and is worthwhile. The author also maintains a web site (cited in the book) that has additional reference material and links that will help with the ""how to"" part."
5,Cheap Car Builders Manual.,I enjoyed reading this book as it tracks most of the build out of a Lowcost seven and as that's what I'm building it has been helpful in figuring out some of the subtle problems that frequently pop up.
3,NOT the new LoCost book,"You should read it in conjunction with the Haynes Roadster or LoCost books. Light, entertaining; but a tad short on detail in some places. More like ""I started with a kit and this is what I ended up with"" story.Still it can serve as an inspiration and source of ideas for those building their own cars."
3,OK book documents one mans project,"Maybe I was expecting too much. The book documents one mans kit type project from frame to finish. I was looking for more technical information. The book was too superficial and did not go into the kind of detail I wanted. (The science of suspension geometry, frame design, etc.) I am interested in building a locost from the ground up. - No frame kit. For those looking to build a locost with a frame kit this is an enjoyable read."
1,Only good if you have a Miata as donor for your S 7,"This is a web site information about how someone built a Super 7 from pieces either bought from some dealer or taken from a Miata donor car. If you have any other model of donor car you will benefit little from reading this book, it falls far behind from Ron Champion's book, here you will be invited more to assemble the car than to buid it, really it describes just how to use parts from different sources plus the Miata."
1,At best a companion book.,"I bought this book having already purchased Ron Champoins ""build a sportscar for less than 250"". I thought this book would be an updated competitor to that book. That thought was soon dispelled as the entire coverage of ""build your own frame"" simply points the reader to the other book, and a few websites that constitute the cult following for it. If you have to have every book written about making your own lotus seven replica buy this book, if you only want to buy one, buy the Champion book."
1,Very poor - Nelson,"This book is very, very poor... I think was purchased similar book of Ron Champions; Build a Sportscar for less than 250"". The frame construction is not covered, others important aspects are not covered. Only a bad book."
5,Such a fulfilling read and an inspiring story,"I so enjoyed this book. The selflessness that one human being can possess is just so humbling for all of us to experience. This book truly kept my interest and was presented in such an remarkable way. The quotes were such a wonderful accompaniment to the sections and the photographs were so helpful to fully understand the true depth of this real-life, real angel and real saint story."
5,Loved it!,Susan writes her book just as she speaks. It's an easy and fast read and a lovely experience. I heard Susan speak at a retreat a few years ago and purchased her book then. I have recently bought more for gifts. Wonderful!
2,Not wht I expected.,"I really wanted to know Mother Teresa's secrets of Sanctity. Not Susan Conroys experiences with the Saint. The book is aobut Susan Conroy and her perspective while working with Mother Teresa, how she felt, what she thought...etc. Not what I expected at all."
3,sleep like a baby,"We love this product, when you've had a hectic stressful day, it will help you fall a sleep. I think it's being discountinued, which is really a bummer!"
5,OutStanding,I've been through quite a few ASP books and this book puts them all to shame. Easy to read and more than enough examples to guide you through troubled times. Nice work Kauffman - Bravo.
5,Excellent Book,"Finally, someone who includes all the detail on how to set up your system so you can go through the sample code. How many times have you bought a book, only to spend a whole lot of time in getting the appropriate system settings before even writing a line of code. In this book the author takes you step by step and gives you a number of reason why something might not work. It's hard enough to learn a new language without the frustation of being unable to run the sample code.This is not to say the rest of the book was not very well done. Actually the books a twofer, giving you both experience in ASP and ADO. I wish all books were written in this fashion."
4,Great for learning and reference,"I have found this book to be a great reference source for me. I have several years ASP experience, but like anyone else do not remember every thing about it and the available components. This book helped me prepare and get my MCP for Interdev."
3,Mediocre Book - Yet Detailed,"This book was not what I expected in the slightest. Yes, it does deal with ASP Databases, but it didn't have exactly what I was looking for. It's more of a ""how-to"" book than a ""you-already-kinda-know-what-you're-doing-but-here-are-some-pointers-anyway"" book. I guess I'm looking for a ASP Databases Programmer's Reference."
1,Not well written,"In my opinion, this book isn't well written. The authors seem to talk about certain subjects before they even teach you what they are talking about. The book also likes to jump around. Even though this book isn't a total waste of money, it should explain in more detail certain subjects that the author should know, might be a little confusing to the reader."
3,Beginning???,"Found this book very tough to get started on ASP with. I consider myself an advanced web designer and I'm pretty competent with VB, but constantly had to reread sections to figure out what the heck he was trying to say. Several of the book examples were tough to get to work also"
2,Expert programmer? New to ASP? This may not be the book.,"This book is as much for those beginning database programming with ADO as it is for those new to ASP. The problem is the emphasis seemed to be heavier on how to use the data-access objects of ADO, that it did on developing ASP applications.If you're a rather experienced developer who has a strong understanding of accessing databases via ADO, consider another book altogether. Much of the material will be redundant for you.Most of the Wrox books I've read are ""quality"". This one is certainly good, but if you happen to be an experienced programmer bridging your skillset over to the internet/ASP world, ""Beginning ASP"" by Wrox is more than sufficient. If you've read it and still want more, I'd skip this book and move on to one of the more advanced ASP books, perhaps ""Professional ASP""."
2,Who taught these guys html?,"Based on the reviews I read of this book I expected more. Much of the html in this book is wrong! As I worked through the examples, I spent much of my time debugging mistakes in the authors' code. If you truly are a beginner to integrating asp pages with databases-prepare yourself. And make sure to get more than just this book."
2,Not good if you are looking for a reference guide to ASP,"I bought this book because I am an ASP beginner and I need to learn the language quickly for work. I have to say, I did not read the book from cover to cover but I have been using it more as a reference when I am stuck. Maybe the information I need is in there somewhere, but I sure can't find it. The index is terrible and most of the simple topics that I want covered are either not in the index or too convoluted to get through in a short amount of time. The person I am working with also has consistantly not found adequite information on the subjects she looks for."
5,Could Wrox Press Offer More,"There isn't enough that I can say about Wrox authors. I currently have ten books published by Wrox from ASP to XML to Site Server. If you want the most out of a ASP/ADO Database experience read this book. Then pick up the ""ADO RDS programming with ASP"" book. Reading these books will turn you into, at least, an ASP/ADO and Database Connectivity guru."
4,Good for Database and ASP coding,This book is really not a step up from the Beginning ASP 3.0 book except for a added detail on connecting to databases and querying databases. If you already know databases and SQL then I would leave this on the shelf. Otherwise it is good for the beginner.
5,good book for begin,good book for beginners. I teach me back during 2001 about ASP and web apps. Good by that time but noways (2012) is outdated.
5,"Solid Foundation for Beginning ASP ""A MUST HAVE""","This book is superbly written and is perfect for everyone who wants to get started with ASP. It's an excellent tutorial covering beginning ASP based web programming.The book teaches you everything you need to know about ASP, SQL Server, COM/ActiveX objects, and stored procedures. This was a big plus for anyone new to ASP Programming because it allows on hands learning. The source code, and examples make every area very clear, and easy to learn, and build on. It also points out the reasons why one would want to use ASP technology to build their web based applications.I recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining an understanding of ASP Development, and as a reference book to stay on your shelves. A definite buy!!!"
5,You Can't Go Wrong,"Although I was tough on John's first book, Beginning Active Server Pages 2.0, his second book is a winner. ASP Databases is almost better than going to a class because John writes as if he is sitting next to you--the inexperienced novice. I have already used this book to create a working, productive database with ASP for my firm and plan to do much more with it in the future. My compliments to your efforts, John. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Great Help,"I found this book to be extremely useful since it provides the WHOLE solution to sample situations, i.e., both the ASP code and the SQL/Access code. So you are provided a complete view of the processing. I am always using situations out of this book as a basis for solving my own application issues. Very helpful."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I purchased this book after reading all the rave reviews, and I must say I didn't think it was all that great. Much of the code is old and outdated. I tried to follow the examples in the book and apply them to real world situations, and more than a few times, I found myself being told not to code the way the book teaches because there was a better way to do it.The book definitly has it strong points and I would recommend it to the ASP newbie, but on a scale from 1-10, I give it a 5."
4,"""Beginning...""?","I included a 4 star rating for this book, because I have no doubt it is wonderfully written for the right person. However, the name ""Beginning ASP Databases"" is a bit misleading. Fortunately, the first few pages tells you exactly what's in the book, who it's for, and what previous knowledge is assumed. Well - quite a bit of previous knowledge is assumed; including (on page 5) ""experience with ASP"" (? ). Page 4 suggests starting with ""Beginning ASP"" prior to using this book (?). I am willing to concede that I made an error in not knowing the difference between ""ASP"" and working with ""ASP Databases"". Anyway - just warning the true beginner out there..."
4,IF Knowledge = Nothing THEN Buy ELSE Read Review,"I recently purchased this book and it was exactally what it said, Beginning ASP Databases. If you are a beginner and you have never worked with ADO or Databases in ASP this one is DEFINATELY FOR YOU. If you are comfertable with opening databases in ASP and performing the basic, select, insert, and delete. Look for something a little more advanced."
1,This book is out of date,"This book is seriously out of date. It does a great job of covering ASP, ADO, database connectons and so on, but there is only one part of one chapter (6) that covers the use of OLE-DB, Microsoft's newest technology that provides the connection and access methods between ASP web pages and databases. The rest of the book, and all the examples, use ODBC which is the older and now out of date method. ODBC was current at the time the book was written, and Mr. Kauffman does a great job of explaining it. However, it is now being replaced by OLE-DB. Also, if you are using Windows 2000 or XP as your development platform, you do not even have the (built-in) option to install ODBC. Instead, OLE-DB comes native with IIS 5.0 which is included with all versions of Windows 2000. Don't buy this book, unless you're still in the dark ages using Win9x or NT."
5,More then Great !,"I didn't know a thing about ASP. After i bought this book, everything was very clear, the information and the method used in this book are very easy to understand, i would say : a good book with a good teacher (Kauffman). Buy it today."
2,NOT ORIGINAL RECORDINGS,"The CD box set is a good value for three cd's, however, what they don't tell you, unless you look really hard on the bottom of the back of the box set that these are re-recorded hits by the original artists. Even though they are ""re-recorded"" by the original artists, they don't sound the same. Use your own judgement, but I was disappointed myself."
1,One hit wonders,"If you think that you are going to get to hear them just like you fell in love with them at the time, you will be let down. It is the right people but redo's and live performances is what you get. VH"
2,Big disappointment,"When my beloved green Eureka Optima died after a few years, I saw that this model was new and improved and was on sale for $69.99 so I bought it. I loved it the first couple of times that I used it. However, it started to lose suction and I realized that when I tried to use it on my hardwood floors, it would spray dirt back onto my bare feet. I have cleaned the filters, replaced the belt and brought it in for a tune-up to no avail. I will be purchasing another Optima."
1,Went bust in few uses,"Was disappointed. Got this product as a Christmas gift - used just a few days literally and started smoking. As per Eureka, got to take to a dealer. Customer service was polite, but I still have the hassle of taking to a dealer, etc. Would NOT recommend."
1,please don't waste your money.,I purchased this vacuum and thought it worked well at first... but after a few months went by i didn't want to use it. its very uncomfortable to use and the suction doesnt' last at all. i couldn't even complete the room without having to find where it was cloged. Please don't waste your money on this machine!!
1,Quite a letdown,"I've used the vacuum twice now, and have noticed that any kind of solid dirt is not picked up by the vacuum, but is rather flung backward behind the vacuum and spread all over the room you are in. This vacuum does okay on carpets / rugs, but it is absolutely terrible on all bare floor surfaces. I vacuumed barefoot today and almost had to throw this piece of junk out into the yard after feeling all of the debris it flung backward instead of picking up. Really, this is a complete waste of money, and I don't buy any of the 5 star reviews here at all. You might be thinking, ""this guy just is bitter, etc"" but I read these reviews before I buy anything and this is the review that should keep you from buying this vacuum, or probably any Eureka."
2,Disappointing,"I live in New Orleans and was anxious to read an account from someone who stayed behind and endured Katrina.What this book was mostly about was bars, alcohol and Quarter characters. I realize the Quarter was not hit as hard as the rest of the city but it was hard to read/accept/beleive that those in the Quarter were drinking and partying while people were dying."
1,Blechhhh......,"Basically a 2 week recount of a drunken binge in the French Quarter after Katrina. Women probably want to avoid this as the author is clearly an egotistical mysogynist.The author at one point participates in looting then later on has the decency to assist the police when others are looting. Whatta guy.Many others lost their lives, families and homes during Katrina. Mr. Smallwood lost his ability to party in the French Quarter and was kind of enough to share his pain with the rest of the world through this sorry excuse for a book. Boo-hoo.Oh yeah...note to Mr. Smallwood. Christian Science is not the same thing as Scientology. Jeez, check your facts."
5,Amazing firsthand account...,"This is an open, honest, detailed, account of the days in the French Quarter following Katrina. I love New Orleans and the Quarter and am a frequent visitor. I can close my eyes and see places and people he is referring to. I am thankful that Mr. Smallwood took the time during this crisis to chronicle the events and share them with us. The characters are real and through his honesty, the author makes you feel as though you live there and are his neighbor as well. I especially like Mr. Larry, who reminds me so much of my Dad who was a Bosun's Mate in the Merchant Marine; I can appreciate and relate to this salty character.Throughout this tragedy, it was the people who stuck together and made it through by helping each other. I believe that New Orleans will return and be better than ever!"
3,Really Good - Hard to read at times,"Being from New Orleans until recently I thought this book was a great perspective to ""the thing"". It made me laugh and cry. I enjoyed reading about what happened from a French Quarter view. A Katrina book that I like even better that Amazon does not have is ""One Dead in Attic"" by Chris Rose. It is an even more human perspective of the aftermath of the storm and survival in the big easy."
5,I was inspired,I enjoyed this book very much. I am considering becoming a stay at home mom. I bought this book and a non-christian book. They were both helpful. I was most inspired by reading what I considered to be God inspired Bible based information. I also like it that his stories were real and not intended to sugar coat the experience. I am making plans to resign my job soon with Gods direction. A bonus of this book to me is the emphasis on Godly managed finances.
3,Not the best out there,I frankly don't know what the best book on this subject is but this can't be it. I love Larry Burkett but this book did not excite me. Don't get me wrong there are several chapters with great advice and very helpful testimonies but overall I was not very impressed. Sorry...
1,Not for you if you're not Christian,"Lots of reference to the Bible - so if you aren't comfortable with that, I don't suggest this book."
1,No practical advice for women trying to make it happen,"As a ""married"", Christian, working woman of three children, I went to this book for guidance and real advice on trying to figure out how to stay at home. I simply did not find that. It may help others that want to stay home and need to know that it can come at ANY cost and to ANYONE, but for those needing practical advice, this book just does not help. When one of the first things I read in this book is that many of society's problems are the result of unwed mothers I had to laugh! Then I went to the front of the book and realized a man wrote this."
2,My Kettle is now not working after 4 months!!,"I am from Scotland and hence drink a lot of tea, so I thought the Dualit would be the perfect kettle for me.While working the kettle was quick to heat up, poured very nicely and looked great on my kitchen countertop. The only thing I didn't like is that it was hard to fill. At this point I would have awarded 4 stars.However after only 4 short months of use, the kettle is no longer working. This is pretty disappointing workmanship for what is an expensive kettle."
1,1 Year Later It Is Not Worth The Money,"At first we loved the kettle. It performed well, being used 5-6 times a day. There normally is a little condensation on the heating element, but right around the time the 1 year warranty expired, we noticed more water at the base. By the time we noticed that one of the windows had a leak, it was after the warranty expired.Dualit has one office in the United States - in New Jersey. We shipped the kettle to New Jersey, then waited 5 weeks to get it back. When we got it back, the kettle was worse looking than when it was sent. I cleaned it before I sent it, the one I got back was dusty and it smelled like glue or epoxy. They had replaced the window but even after several trial runs to get the smell out, it still had an odor and we will not use it.The Dualit kettle is not worth the money - they offer no convenient repair service and will not replace the kettle. Let the buyer beware."
1,RUBBISH ITEM & CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Great looking kettle, lousy customer service. We had had this kettle for 2 years when the window started to leak. (We were away for probably 6 months of that 2 years.) I contact the Dualit UK who put me in touch with a company in New Jersey. They said they couldn't help, as did Dualit UK. No window replacements. No help whatsoever. Rather an expensive product for no after service!I will never buy a Dualit again. We've had a similar problem with the toaster."
1,Leaky,"What a shame.Toasters are great, but the Kettle just leak, leak, leak.Do not buy this product as no after sales available."
1,Dogmatic frisbee,I got it quick but the product is meant for a dog with no teeth. I have a gollden and he chewed through the frisbee and started eating the plastic coil fromthe inside within MINUTES
3,"Some Good, some bad","I read this to simply get a better understanding of Islam. Why the militancy of some factions, how are Sunni different from Shiah, how does Saudi Arabia square their working with the USA and their fundimentalist beleifs, etc.While I did learn a lot it left me with many questions. Dr Farah spends a lot of time talking about the differnt sects within Islam but does it through the leaders that established them more than 500 years ago. While Academically this might be useful it did little to help understand what is going on now. He also talks a lot about what is happening but doesn't get into why it is happening.He also seems to only look at the devevelopments that support the growth of Islam and ignore things that would seem to counter this trend. The more compromising attitude of Lybia, the apparent difference between the leadership of Iran and the will of the people, etc.I found this book helpful but there have to be better options to learn about Islam and what makes it tick."
5,Love this series!,"I have loved.this series since I first watched it. The gritty chemistry between the chacter Bones & Booth is fantastic. The show is a mix of gumshoe detective(Booth) & brillant forsensics/anthropoligist (Bones), their quest to solve crimes. I have also enjoyed the growth of other members of the cast. Great series. Now the quality of the DVD is better than others I've come across."
3,Bones 1-2-3,"I purchases this series for my daughter who is a real ""Bones"" nut! She is very happy with the product and the quick turnaround time it took to arrive. Excellent service!"
4,great deal!,"Product arrived in great condition, exactly as advertised, at a very attractive price. Would recommend the faster delivery for extra bucks if it matters. It took the full 15 days for delivery at the base rate and that was just going from the east coast to Wisconsin."
2,A disappointment,I enjoy the BONES series and was excited to get seasons 1-3 until I discovered that the episodes were burned on both sides of the discs and the B side of the disc consistently breaks up halfway through one or both of the episodes. Major disappointment!
1,waste of money,"love the show, but some of the discs didn't even work. then if a disc worked, some of the episodes wouldn't play."
2,Barely OK....,"This is not a particularly good movie, even for die hard Cheech and Chong fans. I really like their first 4 films, and this one starts out pretty well. It has that slow, leisurely feel that the other Tommy Chong directed films do, and some of the scenes are hilarious, but it's a cheat at the end, where they just fill out the film with a 20 minute concert. While much of the concert footage is good, it feels tacked on. Cheech and Chong just wanted to pad their film out to a feature length running time with it. There are some surreal moments in the film, which makes it interesting, but overall it's really disappointing because of how they just seem to quit at the end of the film. It's really lazy, haphazard, and just plain unprofessional."
5,Great Cheech and Chong movie,One of the bast Cheech and Chong movies. Great footage from Amsterdam. I loved it and would get it if your a Cheech and Chong fan.
4,Faithful Fans Only,"If your reading the reviews, you seeing only two things, very worst, and, very best. Both are true. As far as ""movies"" go, yes, it is probably the absolute worst. But, as far as content, and delivery, and all the little nuanses, It is again, one of the absolute best! Fans only! This movie is quiet simply about them paying hommage to them, for you-the fans....For the true fan, old enough to understand ""all"" of it, it's a must have. For movie watchers-non-fans, semi-fan, it just isn't worth your time."
3,"Not their best, but a good addition to your collection","I was a fan of Cheech and Chong's records long before they did their first movie. The records were chock full of sketch comedy routines featuring a bunch of characters they created in their nightclub act.A common thread in most of the records were two characters called ""Pedro and the Man"", who became the basis of most of their movies.I bought this DVD just to get a chance to see of some of their old nightclub act. They do a few of their biggest characters, including Blind Melon Chitlins, an old blues singer and two dogs named Ralph and Herbie."
3,Ok movie,This movie was not as funny as I thought it would be. I still like Cheech and Chong! Those guys are so funny!
1,Destroy the Print,This is quite simply the worst movie ever made. I could have made a better film with a $1000 budget. There is absolutely no script. It's as if they just let the cameras run and made up dialogue as they went along. As for humor there is not one scene where you will even crack a smile. Do not believe for a second any of the positive reviews you see here. These people have sampled far too much of the substance endorsed by Cheech and Chong. I like a good toke myself but even under the influence this is just pathetic.
1,It's so stupid...,"...but not funny. I don't even know how Cheech and Chong fans could like this movie, because this movie is really different from ""Up in Smoke"" or their other movies. In ""Up in Smoke"" there was at least some direction to the movie, but in this movie most of it is composed of lame comedy gimmicks that were entirely not funny unless you are high off your ass or have an I.Q. less than 20. They don't even smoke in this movie! The closest thing they do to drugs is eat some marijuana leaves... how stupid do they think we are? Stay away from this one!"
1,Leo is right.,This movie is simply terrible. Even 'Waterboy' and 'House Arrest' seem funny in comparison. Too bad there is no 'zero star' option on the pull down menu. Watching ice melt is a more intersting pastime than watching this dog.
4,Good Addition for collectors of Cheech & Chong,"I would akin this movie to ""Up In Smoke"" and ""Next Move"". I loved these two movies, and found ""Still Smoking"" just as hilarious. I have to admit that the last 1/4 of the movie slowed down when they were onstage in the comedy club, but I laughed quite frequently through the rest of this funny move. My Advice is to buy this movie, or at least rent it for a great laugh."
3,"A Near Miss, though it has it's moments","This film by the doped duo is one of they're couple of misfires. Not as big as The Corsican Brothers (which is bad, though not the worst that could happen), though a somewhat far cry from the days of Nice Dreams and Up in Smoke.The film focuses on the two and they're ventures before and at a festival in Amsterdam. However, it is mainly a set-up for a movie where they show off they're talent that made them a success on stage before the movies. Fascinating, to be sure, however the downtrip of this is that a number of the bits off and on stage in the movie just aren't that funny. The two show they have genuine and remarkable talent, but the mark isn't totally hit like in the earlier 4 movies. Best sequences though- Blind Melon Chitlin, the boobs in the sauna (why not), and the Detroit/Jamaican drug seller.Not a total waste of time, but it isn't gold either."
3,Acceptable movie,"Well, I got to admit it is not the best movie from these guys.Lucky for me that I friend of mine bought from me. Didn't like very much..."
3,Still Smokin After 20 years.,"This was a good performance by Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. This takes place in Amsterdam,Holland. Cheech and Chong try to make money dealing hash legally in Holland but the job turns backwards on them.There are some suggestive scenes like when they police fly over a beach and see some dutch women who take their bikinis off. Good movie of you are over at least 16."
4,Magnificent synthesis,"Braudel weaves together natural history and human history in a seamless garment. He is skillful at demonstrating how the Mediterranean environment impacted and helped create the civilizations that formed the basis for Western culture. The author's great insight, that Egyptian, Greek and Roman cultures are part of a Mediterranean whole, is summarized brilliantly in this book. An essential synthesis after a reader has gotten to know the three great ancient civilizations."
2,not recommended,This book is nowhere near the others like it and the topics it covers are boring. Dont waste your time or your money.
3,Tries. Does not succeed.,"Russ Kick, 50 Things You're Not Supposed to Know (disinfo,com, 2003)Don't you love books like this? Their titles promise you the secrets of the universe (which universe, of course, depends on what you're reading into the title), but what they deliver is invariably not what you were looking for. Expect the same here.When he's on his game, Kick does deliver some interesting and relatively obscure data to the reader. When he's not, which is unfortunately all too often, he hands us stuff that's been on at least a thousand trivia lists circling the internet at any given time. Combine this with Kick's obvious slant towards some of his subject matter, which is so predictable it's almost stereotypical, and you get a book that, despite its slimness, can be wearying at times.Good to pick up and riffle through once in a while looking for something random. Not a keeper, though. **"
4,Teaser,Good book with a lot of information. Some things I already knew but most I didn't. Wide variety of subjects are covered.
3,Home made but still nice,"I ordered this face plate for my living room. When I recieved it I was shocked to find out that its a ""homemade"" product. The print is glued on the surface of a regular cheap beige face place. However, it does work in my living room and no one but me knows."
3,Cut a bit short,"The art is beautiful, but all the products I bought from this vendor were cut a bit short, so there's a hole between the cover and the wall. If I had known that, I would not have bought it."
1,Its falling apart!!!!,The images are beautiful but the book itself its falling apart. I have many books of the same size and I have not had a book that will lose it's pages while being handled. Amazon already replace this book once (great service!) but the new book shows the same problem. Maybe a bad bach? The problem is that this book its a must have. This book deserves a five star review but because the bad quality of the binding I can only give it one star.
5,Museum Catalogue,"This is a comprehensive, visually stunning catalogue of items from the collection of the National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City. Not only is the museum a must see, but the catalogue is an excellent resource for those interested in this field. Highly recommended."
5,bbe,loved it. but i did think wendy shouldve done more rearsh on things and josie could be a little full of her selve nobodys perfect it was a good book over all a definate read for teens
3,miss o,"Leap Day was a story about Josie Taylor, a 16 yr old celebrating her birthday, well actually she is really only 4 yrs old. She was born on February 29, which only comes around every four yrs. her birthday is a very eventful one. From going on a scavenger hunt to taking her drivers Ed test. The book chapters are split up into two sections. The first is from the point of view of Josie. The second is what really happened. Josie experiences many crazy things on her birthday but nothing will be as shocking as the secret that her best friend will tell her. I recommend this book to anyone who likes an adventure-packed book."
4,Josie's DaY,"This well written, mind-setting book, by Wendy Mass, is a great book about this young girl having her once every four years birthday. Her talent: acting. Favorite Class: Drama. Her name: Josie Taylor. Josie goes through a great day, without knowing what clues lie beneath eveything she unraps.Josie is a well put teen that wishes that her birthday, be the best ever. While you read on and on, you see how her freinds think of her and what the go through. Later, the story just gets better.I would recommend this book to anyone over 11. This insperational book reflects on how a normal teen can change in a moment. I hope one day, there can be more books this interesting and influncing. It also tells people that they should be who they are. And like Josie says ""Tommorow, I'll wake up to a new day, being myself."""
3,miss o - kaitlin mccormick,"Leap Day was a story about Josie Taylor, a 16 yr old celebrating her birthday, well actually she is really only 4 yrs old.

Josie experiences many crazy things on her birthday but nothing will be as shocking as the secret that her best friend will tell her. I recommend this book to anyone who likes an adventure-packed book."
3,Not a fave for my 12-yr old,"My twin daughters (12 yrs old) love Wendy Mass books, and have read and enjoyed several. Only one daughter has read this one, and she wasn't crazy about it. She says, ""It didn't flow."""
4,AWESOMENESS,it was an amazing book and especially if you are going to high school next year it made me think twice about what I should and shouldn't do.
3,Strange,"I have only read one fourth of this book and i don't really care for it, the two different parts confuse me, and its kinds more for girls the age of nine."
4,4.5 Stars is what I'd like to rate it,"Wendy Mass is a very good author, and I liked this book a lot. It was interesting to know what everyone was thinking, and especially interesting to see how their perspectives were different from Josie's. I didn't give it a full five stars because at times, it would get a bit boring. But all in all, it is a good book for teenagers."
5,A great book,I liked this book because I've never read one like it it's more interesting than an ordinary birthday and better.
4,Cynic turns over new leaf,"I bought the book yesterday and read it in less than 24 hours. Well written, interesting and an all-round pleasant read. I didn't really want to put it down, but I was too tired. I woke up at 5 a.m. and finished it. The story is very engaging and the way that it's formatted makes you forget you're reading a book. Written somewhat in the style of Daddy Long Legs by Jean Webster. All of you have either been or thought about a cyber romance so pick it up, tell your friends!"
1,Sandwich cage way too narrow,"The Duallit sandwich cage barely holds one half-inch piece of bread, let alone two for a sandwich. It rips the bread and makes a mess of the toasters slot. I through away twenty bucks on this apparatus!"
5,Great item,"One of the perks of my very expensive toaster is this gadget. Yes, you can use sliced bread, just be sure to buy thinner pre-sliced bread. Pepperidge Farm light style works well and comes in many varieties incl. oatmeal and seven grain. Butter the outsides and add a slice of meat and cheese, or whatever, so long as its not too bulky. Small tortilla wraps can be folded in half with meat and or cheese for another tasty lunch item. Here's to tasty lunches!"
4,Easy way to make a toasted sandwich,"I purchased a Dualit toaster and decided to try these optional accessories. In three minutes I had made two toasted cheese sandwiches so easily that my teen-age sons wanted to try. Simply butter your slices of bread, put a few slices of cheese between the bread, and put your sandwich into the sandwich cages. The cages fit into the slots of the dualit toaster but you do have to watch for pieces of bread that might stick through the cage. We used regular Italian loaf bread without any problem. Set the toaster for just under 3 minutes, wait about 1 minute after toasting, and you are ready to enjoy your sandwich. Much easier than getting a frying pan out and making the sandwiches the old way. The sandwich cages come with recipes for other sandwich ideas."
2,"Works, kind of","It works, but the slots on the toaster are way too narrow to allow two pieces of bread in them. Also, if you stuff it in there anyway, the outside of the bread will toast long before the inside heats up. So, there really isn't much point to this, at least for making sandwiches.I use mine mainly to help stuff in single pieces of bread that are too large for the slots."
3,Juan Valentin,This gentleman has sung some very beautiful songs...too bad they are not on this album. I was dissappointed with this album.
1,"unreliable ,prone to failure","Comcast installed this modem at my house. Two months later, it failed. The technician installed a new one, DOA. So third one is an Arris cablemodem and it works( so far.) Comcast has already committed to use Arris equipment for super highspeed , RCA equipments must have been performed poorly as a whole."
3,Good Modem goes offline without Notice,I've had the modem for about one month. So far it runs good and install was very easy. Three times now the modem just went offline and was diffcult to reset ended up having to un plug the modem to reset it. I give it 3.5/5 stars so far will see how long it lasts.
1,Always with problems,It always drops connections and has conflict with my netgear router. I would not recommend getting this particular router.Spend about $50 and get a decent motorola modem.
1,Returned Item,Good responce from company to problem with item. Would purchase something else from them again. Modem didn't work properly.
2,Seduction?,"This is the second romance book in my life that I had to skim through the pages just to finishes it.This should not be considering as a desire book. I think this book applies more to intimate moments category in which suspense is evolved.The characters were well developed so I have to give the writer some credit for that. However the story by itself is really bad. It was hardly romance in this book. The first romance scene happens on page 136 (a kiss) and there is nothing again until page 153. The book has 184 pages. That says a lot.The whole book is about a cousin that was muttered. Not really emphasizing the characters passion for each other.Surprising, but this one is not one of the best book of Justine Davis"
4,The official ISO standard.,"This is not the first book you should read about SGML, but if you are going to do any serious development in SGML, you need this on your bookshelf. It contains the entire text of the ISO standard, plus Goldfarb's annotations"
3,"Turgid, obscure, confusing; but essential for advanced SGML.","This is a particularly badly written book on a particularlybadly designed and written standard, SGML.However, SGML is so far the only reasonably universal andstandard way of marking up text, and this is the onlycomprehensive treatment of it, including all the peculiarlittle bits that you probably should never use. The bookincludes the full text of the ISO standard as well ascross-references and annotation.The book, like the standard, uses terminology and notationwhich are not standard in the rest of computer science. Thetutorial material is weak. The book design is ugly and hardto read.Yet SGML, bad as it is, is an important and useful standard,and this is a comprehensive reference for it. Let us hopethat both the standard and the book will be improved radicallyin the future."
1,Forget About it !!!! it is very BAD,"They try to compare it to Angelopoulos films!!!!Sad, very sad, poor performance, a waste of time and talent.It is too bad, there are so many excellent Greek films that can be promoted via Amazon.The acting, the cinematography, the scenario, especially the scenario are bad. Film Noire, if it was B&W; maybe. Sometimes I wonder who are the critics who give these awards to such poor films that ridicule our intelligence, intellectualism and passion for the arts and culture.Anyways, my humble advise is save your money there are so many other Greek movies that can be truly unforgettable and enjoyable."
3,Tastes rather good but lacks the kick of Starbucks Iced Coffee,"I bought this after learning of the sad demise of Starbucks Iced Coffee which was my favorite canned coffee/energy beverage ever. It actually tasted like iced coffee, not a coffee flavored dessert beverage. I'll really miss that stuff. Sniff.This stuff tastes rather good, but the coffee flavor is overwhelmed by the sweeetness, and it just plain lacks the caffiene kick of the late great Starbucks Iced Coffee. Why is every drink company now coming out with creamy super sweet coffee cold canned beverages, but canned iced coffee doesn't even sell when Starbucks tried it? I don't get it, and I'm not sure whether or not I'll get another case of this stuff.However, some caffiene is in there, but I don't feel anything close to the ""three hits"" touted on the label, and although ""sleep is overrated"" I found it quite easy to get to sleep shortly after consuming a can last night, and I had a lot of work to get done."
3,Mocha Latte,"I ordered this product by mistake because my family is not really into chocolate flavored drinks. As mocha drinks go, we found this to be tasty and did finish all of the cans. However, we do not plan to order it again."
5,An Inadvertant Window Into NWO,"I saw a promo for this book when I was a member of the Conservative Book Club twenty years ago, and I passed it over, but I made a mental note. Then I saw it referenced in Barry Goldwater's personal memoirs (titled, ""With No Apologies""), and I decided to get it.This book, plus Goldwater's, shines a large amount of light on the question: ""Who has really been pulling the strings in American military and foreign policy over the past 50 years (or more)?"" A casual reading of one or the other of these books may lead one to agree wtih the traditional boilerplate American conflict between ""Republican"" and ""Democrats"" or ""Conservatives"" and ""Liberals"". However, taken together, and in the light of other research, it becomes obvious there are forces much larger at work ""behind the curtain"" of media deceptiion.This book is a must-read for those wishing to get deeper into the motivations of the good and evil men in the world."
1,"""Short"" White Bread Competition","Although I understand it would be very difficult for Amazon.com to verify comments made regarding this book, I would be hard-pressed to believe that it is being used in colleges & high schools since the material covered has been rehashed too many times to mention. The typical story line of the misunderstood character who has to react to perceived injustices has been played out once too often. While I found the story line easy to follow, it also seemed too predictable-like the movie you knew would end with the ""good guy"" getting the girl. An obivous first-work by the author, it read like a class project for a journalism major...maybe next time."
1,Smarty Deserves Better,"The story of Smarty Jones is a remarkable one. Sadly, this is not the book that tells it. It barely scratches the surface and technically it needed an editor. The text is full of grammatical and punctuation errors. Words are randomly capitalized. Mr. Valentine also has an ANNOYING HABIT of OVERUSING ALL CAPS, as if the reader can't get his point without his help. I was there when Smarty won the Preakness and was at the rail for the Belmont. I was hoping to relive some of those feelings through the book.Smarty Jones was one of those rare horses that transended the sport. He deserves better than this."
3,Forever a Champion.,"Smarty Jones is a Champion. I enjoyed reading about Smarty Jones, and what Smarty Jones accomplished. Comparing Smarty Jones to Secratariat and Seattle Slew is not very mature. Considering Secratariat and Seattle Slew both won the (Triple Crowns) and (Horse of the Year) awards.In my opinion Billy Valentine will make a good Author, if he sticks with the subject, and is not so opinionated. Good book about Smarty Jones, and Team Smarty."
1,Worst Book Ever Written,I have never left a review before but I felt compelled to warn people off of this horrible book. First of all the author is one of their friends and not an actual author which explains why a two year old could have written a better story. Also he seems to not know anything about horse racing and barely scratches the surface of what could have been written about and instead wastes the book by using exclamation marks everywhere!!!!! I think this book is the worst thing I have ever tried to read.
1,Highway Robbery,"I rarely leave reviews but this book was so bad I have to warn people not to buy it. I see 2 people selling it used, one for $42 and another for $50. I wouldn't pay $2 for it. Nevermind all the grammatical and spelling errors (doesn't know the difference between to and too and their and there), it also wreaks of sentimentalism and exaggerations for extra effect. I had to read the ""About the author"" section because it was so mushy I thought a teenage girl had written it. You are better off digging up old newspaper and magazine articles on the Internet or in the library to learn about Smarty Jones."
1,"""On"" button broke after 3 days use",Seemed like a nice product with good features and a decent price (after $40 rebate (...). My 11 year liked his gift that he could use on the long bus rides to and from school. I'm sure he didn't abuse it but even if he did shouldn't the power on/play button be able to stand up to more than 3 days of use? We'll have to send it back now to the manufacturer for service or replacement. 11 year old and I are very disappointed.
1,"Great Stories, But Forgot the POOL!!",I have read several books latley Hustler Days and Playing off the Rail to name a few. This book doesn't even belong in the same name as Pool. The Stories made no sense what so even. This book is made up of very short stories. The first one only mentioned pool because the background story took play by it. no ON IT!!If someone offers you this Book to read RUN!!!
3,Works good so far,The only problem I am having is that it does not sit flat. It wobles. Two oposite legs are longer than the others causing it to woble. Poor quality control for a toaster that costs this much.
5,SisterKarolsBook OF Spells And Blessings,"Her book met my expections and more.I learned some things I did't know before about praying with candles.The book is well written,easy to understand,and covers several differant spells and prayers.I will refer to it often."
4,Very sweet and inspiring little book,"A friend gave me this sweet little book for my birthday and I thought it was a wonderful little gift. I can't tell you if all the spells/prayers work, but I guess that is up to your own faith and ability. This book is beautifully made and a nice little inspirational gift to someone who needs some special magic in their lives."
1,Karol is not a real Catholic Nun!,"Don't be fooled into thinking that ""Sister"" Karol is a real Catholic nun. She still claims to be, but the ""order"" she belongs to, Sisters for Christian Charity, is not a canonical order. It has no official standing in the Catholic Church. It is a non-heirarchical, ecumenical group of disgruntled and heretical women who will not admit that they do not really believe in Church teachings. A more honest thing for her to do would be to leave the Catholic Church, but who would buy her book without the pretense that a Catholic nun would write a book of spells. The ""naughtiness"" of a dissenting nun is the drawing card. Don't buy anything she writes, literally or figuratively."
1,A witch nun's get rich scheme,"...is the first thing that popped into my head when I saw this in the bookstore. How despicable. A Catholic nun, a woman supposedly sworn to the service and prayerful devotion of Christ concocting this pagan nonsense. I spent a fair amount of time reading over it - (there isn't much here, don't expect much of a read) and slammed it down with disgust. But then I looked deeper into the author and some of her other writings and it's plain what's at work here. Buy it if you need airy fairy feel good nonsensical pap for your jaded post modern mind grown too cynical for true religion. All others save your money."
3,Watch out folks...,"I've read that this is Beagle's favorite of his stories. It's not mine. Captivated by Beagle's work, I devoured this book in search of a continuation (of style or feeling) of The Last Unicorn and A Fine and Private Place. This book is not at all what I was looking for. To make a true judgement on the book, I'd have to read it again - I was really just too shocked to see this book for what it was instead of what it wasn't. This book has an orgy in it - not a bad thing, but not exactly The Last Unicorn either, now is it? I guess it was kind of like trying to recapture your childhood, only to find that you've become and forever will be an adult."
3,Interesting,"A couple of surprises, a dark little love story, plenty of magic, and first person narrative with multiple narrators. How could this book not be fun? It was, rather original, you have to pay attention or the descriptions can get a bit confusing. Reading it twice might make it more enjoyable. I, however, wasn't very moved by the book. If you are looking for an enjoyable story, purely for entertainment, get this book. It was an interesting story, but the overall affect wasn't terribly strong."
2,Disappointing,"After reading 'The Last Unicorn', I must say I was not impressed with Peter Beagle`s latest work, which seems to combine all the worst elements of his writing and none of the best. Set in a colorless, drab, nondescript world, the story is told from a dozen different perspectives in a somewhat rag-tag style. Beagle is painfully obvious in his attempts to develop the characters or make us believe that some great depth lies beneath the surface of each one (a too-terrible-to-talk-about-past, a love too deep to put into words,etc.) and it is through this blatant lack of subtlety that all attempts fall flat. The total absence of any sense of morality only increased my dislike for the characters, though I got the impression that it was intended for amusement. The ideas that pervade the book are aimless, contrived in accordance with the plot instead of the other way around; thus the entire book has little more substance than the song upon which it was based"
1,Not all that much to say.,"There really isn't. This book just plain didn't grab me. The characters didn't interest me, and most of the plot twists came out of nowhere. In every review I read I hear people exclaiming over the inclusion of multiple first-person viewpoints, and I can't imagine why it's so fascinating. You can get the same effect from a Babysitters Club ""super special."" Stated simply, I just thought this book was dull and nowhere near the quality of Beagle's other works, both earlier and later."
3,"Nor so good, neither so bad","Unfortunately I agree with most of Ariod's comments about the novel (below). Still it is quite well written and much better than most of nowadays fantasy (which means almost nothing). There are some nice and new ideas (for example the great fox character!) but there is no magic in this book you could expect from the author of ""The Last Unicorn""."
5,Worked really well!,I'm glad I got this for my teen son. He's a big guy and it fits! It didn't came with gloves..but that is okay. He really like how it look on him. Just glad to had purchased it; it served its purpose!
4,"Great, inexpensive robe","Bought this robe for a Holloween party last year. It served its purpose well. Tried it on for this year's party, but noticed it was slightly torn, since my feet kept catching on to it (I'm pretty short, so your milage may vary) Materials aren't of the strongest type, but it kinda adds to the effect when its ripped. I recommend purchasing if you're looking for an inexpensive robe that looks pretty good."
3,Good but not great,"The RCA DRC510N has a lot of features and puts out a great picture, but the 5-disc changer is what sold me; however, it was disappointing to find out that the remote does not allow you to switch to a different disc, at the end of one DVD it does not automatically start playing the next disc, and also MP3 discs do not automatically play, instead a menu appears on your screen and you have to make a selection. So at the end of the day, the 5-disc changer is only really a 5-disc storage bin and you have to get off the sofa to switch between discs."
3,No disc skip on remote! Really a one-disc player.,"The player would be great except for a ""fatal"" flaw -- the remote does not have a disc skip button! This means that the 5-disc player is really only a one-disc player -- you still have to get up and manually control the player to change discs.If you're looking for a one-disc player, you should consider this one. Otherwise, it is very disappointing."
2,Disc skip is hidden.,"I bought this player 6 months ago and it just died. You actually can skip DVDs from the remote. You just have to hit the numbers on the remote numbered 1-5 and it will skip to the corresponding DVD. The thing that annoyed me most about this player is that there was no way to tell what DVDs were loaded in the unit. You either had to remember what ""DVD in tray number 3"" was or go through every DVD until you got the correct one."
3,The great outdoors,This movie was ok.It was a little funny.It was also a little dated.But if you like John Candy go for it.
5,Great Movie,This was a great value for the price. The shipment came within the amount of time expected and was new as advertised.
5,The Great Outdoors,"Excellent family movie. Looked all over for this one. Got it from Amazon and now I don't go anywhere else for cd's or dvd's as anything we like is found on this secure site.Thank you Amazon.Mrs. M., Canada"
4,Very Funny and well made Canadian Comedy with Dan Aykroyd and John Candy,"Poor Bart, the Bear at the end! T.V. Printshave pretty good editing so they are suitablefor kids. One of Aykroyd and Candy's best!"
5,A great funny family oriented movie !,"Being a John Candy Fan this movie is in line with other lovable characters portrayed by Candy. Throw in Dan Aykroyd along with other very good supporting actors, a very good plot, and a nice setting and how can you not end up with a movie where the laughs and story line never get old and one that could be watched over and over again ! Just a good funny entertaining family movie ! There are a couple scenes that may not be appropriate for younger children but over all a clean family oriented movie."
5,Movie,This is a fantastic movie. Grew up watching it and every time I see it the hilarity brings me back to my childhood.
4,Classic Akyroyd and Candy at the Lake,"No one who has taken a family vacation to a lake should miss the Great Outdoors. Vintage goofy slapstick between Candy and Akyroyd carry the film, and besides a little too much teen romance backstory, this will not disappoint if you want some good laughs."
5,A favorite,"One of our family favorites. Not an Oscar contender, but a simple move that is funny for the family."
5,John Candy movies are classics!!,"John Candy movies have become classics - I grew up watching him and now I am buying the DVDs so my 2 children can enjoy him, too. He always lit up the screen and made some enjoyable family movies. My 5 year old laughs and laughs at his antics on screen."
5,HD was clear!,"Love this movie and I was glad to watch it again. The picture quality was HD worthy, not the old VHS type graininess. If you liked this movie, it's a great way to watch it and share it with younger people that didn't see it the first go around. Some people get turned off by the ""look"" of what they consider an old movie and this HD version takes care of that.""He said go faster."" Love it!Simone"
4,Downright hilarious!,"I love this movie, John Candy at his best with Dan Akroyd playing the uptight rich guy that we all love to hate. These two characters clash throughout the movie, displaying a great chemistry between the two actors. Watching this movie makes me sad that Candy is no longer with us, as he was just fun to watch.The reason that I give this 4 stars is that I could not stand the forced summer teen romance that was a part of the formula for most movies in the 80's. They could have cut those bits out altogeher and it would have been better.The physical comedy between John Candy and an eleven foot grizzly make this a classic and a must-have."
5,CLASSIC!! Needs to be in your movie collection,"I love this movie, if you have ever gone on a family vacation you can relate. Its just a classic John Candy flick and hilarious. A movie I can watch over and over and never get sick of.A must have, it was a hit when I saw it in the 80's and still one of my favorites."
2,Big disappointment,"I certainly agree with Roger Ebert on this one. From a movie starring John Candy and Dan Aykroyd, written by John Hughes, you'd expect to get entertained. ""The Great Outdoors"" doesn't deliver. There's hardly any plot, which could have been excused if there were plenty of funny moments, but there are only very few funny scenes and even those are only mildly amusing and not exactly laugh-out-loud funny. Most of the time the movie is just silly and slow, the plot going nowhere. Considering the talent involved it's a big disappointment and only worth watching if you're a very big fan of the stars."
3,It Just Shows You That John and Dan are a bad mix.,"This movie starts out slow as ever and takes so long to reach the laughs that it needs. Very light script, stupid plot, but John Candy is funny as hell."
1,Wake me when it's over,"When I saw this movie I thought it's a shame Dan Aykroyd and John Candy wasted their skill on a dumb movie like this. I don't like it because the writer just slopped together junk and the producer acccepted it instead of saying, "" sorry, pal people won't like this, you should rewrite it and use better humor"". But no, he just accepted it not realizing he'd be partly known for a dumb movie like this. My point is you shouldn't waste time watching it. If you like Candy see Planes, Trains, & Automobiles."
1,Great time if you like the films stars and Dan Aykroyd !,"Great time if you like the films stars and want to see Dan Aykroyd shirtless picking his nose hairs! It also had John Candy as Aykroyd brother! The brother drive each nuts during the camping trip! Eventually the families fight over stuff! Aykroyd must clean with his wife over a job work thing the movie as well! Annette Benning (American Beauty,In Dream,The Siege) also co-stars in this movie!"
3,Not as Good as Other John Candy Films,"A good family movie featuring John Candy & Dan Akyroyd with a few funny moments. Video transfer & sound are very good. Can only give this a 3 star rating when compared to some of Candy's other films which are definately 5 stars. ""Uncle Buck"", ""Summer Rental"", and ""Canadian Bacon"" to mention just a few."
3,Not very good,"This is my first ever review, but I felt it was necessary. After purchasing these cards, I realized that they are not very sturdy, they are made of flimsy paper. Also, they don't provide what I need for writing my own drug cards. Buy the Davis cards instead."
2,ho hum,Not very interesting unless you are a Brit and maybe knew some of these people. It sort of opens a world most of us never knew and will never know.
1,Not a good read for me,Very hard to follow. This was not what I was expecting when I purchased it. I didnt read past the first few chapters before i gave up and stopped reading.
4,A great doll,"I bought this doll for my 20 month old daughter. The doll is so soft and cuddly. You can take the clothes off and on, learn to button, snap, tie and has their name on it! Not only is this doll a great cuddle toy, it is also very educational. I highly recommend the Soft Doctor Doll for any little child."
1,Blair Witch project all over again...,"Ended up buying this based on some of the other reviews on here. That ended up being a mistake. This is another example of a shaky-cam/found footage movie. It follows the Blair Witch formula right up to the very end. There is nothing new to see here and the story is not at all compelling. If you find an old mans apartment, an empty field and the dark interiors of cars interesting, then this is the movie for you. In short, don't waste your money on this one like I did. You have been warned."
2,Takes a down turn,"Its starts off like an interesting legit documentation, then tails off into a poor Blair Witch copy. A bit dissapointing.This is NOT a documentary."
4,Fun Blair Witch Knock-Off,"Yeah, it's a rip-off of Blair Witch. So what? I still thought it was pretty fun and effective. It was surprisingly funny at times, too. Lloyd, the central figure of the film, was pretty hysterical. The Plot: In an attempt to uncover a decades-old conspiracy involving alien-cover-up, old guy Lloyd enlists the help of some amateur documentary filmmakers. In the process, Lloyd inadvertantly unleashes a seemingly omnipresent gaggle of shadowy, violent federal agents who chase them down at every turn. As the tension builds, so does the fun. However, the last fifteen minutes of the movie are shot in virtual blackness. All you can do is pretty much listen to what's happening in the film. However, if you're like me and you love alien-related junk, you'll probably dig this little movie. All those expecting special effects and violence, however, beware! There is none. Check it out if you like X-Files and Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity or The Fourth Kind. You might like it."
4,creepy as hell,"I saw this at the Hollywood Film Festival a year ago. It really crawled under my skin and a part near the end made the audience jump a mile. A couple of people behind me had to leave because they were too creeped out. It's made like 'Blair Witch', but I liked this better. It had the kind of story and effect on you that made you think about it long after it was over."
5,Great songs-,Thought the material was well done. Have to listen to the NY song and the Clinton song. Artist also does good representation on country music and celtic music.
4,"Whoooo doggggy, this here's a winner",We aint seen nothin like this here compact disc in a while. My daddy would have loved this here recording of good home country flavor.
4,Bonney remains artful even as her voice ages,"Voices age in different ways, with negative results as you rise up the scale. Deep basso voices can remain intact well into a singer's sixties and beyond, but coloratura sopranos are rarely delightful past fifty. Barbara Bonney's lustrous voice has lost much of its bloom and gained some huskiness as well as a wobble under pressure. Also, the other reviewer here is right to point out how poorly Bonney pronounces the text in the Quilter songs; she swallows syllables everywhere else, too. But it's too harsh to deny this singer her acclaimed musicality and intelligence. This isn't the best of Bonney's solo recitals, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and welcome the chance to hear a major singer in the Britten songs, and a non-Anglo style in the Quilter."
2,The Tragic Cost of Popularity,"It is always such a thrill to hear recordings of top singers early in their careers when their voices are still fresh, energetic, full of flexibility and vitality and the technique is solid. Unfortunately, for some singers, the cost of being at the top is the toll on the voice, managing the impossible performing schedule most top singers confront. This recording sounds like a singer who is vocally exausted. Consequently, the technical care with which Ms. Bonney recorded her first recordings is sadly lacking here. As a voice professor I play samples of Ms. Bonney's earlier recordings as ""what one should do"". With this recording, I now find I am playing examples of ""what one should not do"". I purchased this recording for the value of the unique repertoire. I was terribly disappointed in the execution."
3,Could be improved,Its a great idea.. but the scratching tool is really cheap. This would be a great product for kids. I would recommend for more serious artists who are still interested in this product to purchase their own professional grade scratching tool.
3,Interesting to say the least,"Be forewarned, for those who are purchasing this for the sake of full frontal nudity, be warned that this is art and not pornography.The movie is a documentary on the efforts and hardships of Simon Morley and his traveling show, the Puppetry of the Penis. In terms of struggling artists, this is a great documentary to show how hard it can be to get a show up and running. Add to the mix, full frontal nudity and you can see exactly how hard it can be (no pun intended).The show in question, of course, is Dick Tricks and it will generate a chuckle out of you. It will also make many men go home and try these tricks at home. If this movie can create some added fun in the bedroom then it gets stars galore, otherwise a good rental for documentary purposes, or a great film to sit with you friends and laugh quite a bit."
2,2 and a half stars.,"At first I was laughing at what these guys where doing on stage with there own deeks. However, i stopped laughing when it would cut to behind the stage stuff and the guys on tour and how the tour was not the success they hoped it was.By the time this thing had finished, i had stopped laughing, there is only so many tricks and gags you can do on this subject that can keep you laughing. It seemed like they have a total of about 15 tricks they do, and it's stretched in time with bits and pieces thrown in between to make it seem like more then a 10 minute show.If you can rent this or find it on youtube you will see it's not really something you would want to own and watch again. It's much like the Mr Methane DVD, there is only so many fart jokes you can do before it begins to smell like the same old ^&%$#"
3,Work of Art? Give Me a Break!,"The very idea of calling this art is laughable! Puppetry of the Penis has none of the elements of art. This show features two men playing with themselves in front of an audience. Entertaining? Yes, but the lowest common denominator type of entertainment. The show has been an international hit, but that doesn't make it art. It merely shows that many people will buy a ticket to watch two men performing acts that most men got over by the time they reached adolescence. Classify this as a bulesque show, not art."
1,In all honesty save your money!,"Puppetry of the penis - tackle happy, is nothing more then plain male infantilism at its best portrayal. If two women were shown doing vagina tricks, it would be instantly labeled as pornographic. However when two men do it, it is labeled as art. Who ever labeled this, as art clearly has no knowledge of what they are talking about? Art is something that captivates the eye with beauty in image and form.This movie is nothing but a bore and torture to watch the full length. I got through the first 15 minutes and was fed up of the two lame dicks and not to mention their dicks too. Most people who buy this movie will most likely watch the first few minutes and then either through the movie into the garbage as this is all it is or ask for a refund from your vendor.I returned my movie; I did not want to loose my money on something that is not worth it. Learn from viewer mistakes and save your money, if you purchase it, trust me, you will be in for a huge disappointment."
1,THIS IS PORN,I think it is a joke that people say this is not porn it is art. Men are manipulating their genitals in front of thousands of people....call it what you will but this is trash. I wanted to give this no stars but this site made me choose!
3,"Simplistic, B-grade thrills.","Its a pretty easy read. The research is quite interesting if you like these sort of sci-fi/archeo reads, but the novel is quite simplistic. The author makes many assumptions just to fit parts of the book together. Mr. Alten has a terrific background for a story and I wish he'd exercised better imagination than what he put out.Skip it unless you don't have anything better to read on hand."
1,Someone Say It Isn't So,"This novel is a pretentious comic book - hardly the ""greatest book ever written."" The comparison to ""Indiana Jones"" is apt and if that's what you want, this rejected movie script of a thriller is right up your deadend alley. As for the ""greatest book I ever read"", well, have you read them all yet, or even more than a few? I'm still partial to Stendahl's ""Red and the Black."" But Alten's work may be literature to those who view ""Joe Dirt"" as great cinema and think Denny's a five star dining experience. Others, beware."
1,Too far out,"I read his last two books because I like giant dinosaur sharks, but this book has nothing cool like that. Mostly religous mumbo jumbo and aliens. Hard to get into the story and kinda weird. If anything two much stuff in it. Alten's beached himself for good with this one. buy buy."
2,Domain,"An intern at a mental institution believes an inmate's story that an ancient Mayan prophecy is about to come true and that the world will end. The inmate, Mick Gabriel, is the son of a late ridiculed archaeologist and convinces an intern (Dominique, a beautiful adopted woman of Mayan decent, of course) that his being locked up is part of a conspiracy by the American Secretary of State who has a personal vendetta. Dominique helps Mick escape and together they run around trying to save the world as the sinister Secretary of State, evil aliens, and nuclear war impede their progress. That's the rough synopsis of this book's stupid plot. Steve Alten is actually a pretty good thriller writer and keeps the plot moving along at an entertaining pace. Mostly though this book just screams out to be turned into a high-budget but utterly crappy sci-fi movie. There's apparently a sequel to this book that I don't plan to bother with."
3,A disappointment,"I realized after getting near the end of this book that it was an incredible waste of time. Wishy washy characters and several repetitions of stating the obvious made me groan out loud. It's not a bad book, and I did like it until midway through (until the characters really started annoying me), but I wish he would have wrapped it a little tighter and created some believable characters."
5,CAPTIVATING,Right from the start I was unable to put the book down. The plot and charactrs were captivating and I passed the book on to a friend a soon as I competed it. He also enjoyed the read.
4,Lots of Pseudo Faux Science Fun,"Paperback/Sci-Fiction: I figured I'd better get this one off the shelf because 2012 is around the corner and this is a trilogy. I really loved Alten's shark books and this one was pretty good too.Let's get the hard part over: There were some problems: 150 pages too long, slow beginning, undone loose ends. The biggest thing I did not like was the father's journal. Instead of a man, who has pretty much isolated for much of his life, seems to get saner as his journal goes on.The good parts are everything else. I liked the comic book fun of the sci-fi. It was way out there and a page turner. Just have fun with it and don't take it too seriously. The main two characters are likable. The government is conspiratorial. The aliens are evil. What else you want?"
5,He's Done It Again!!,"First it was Meg, then The Trench . . . now with Domain, Steve Alten has written what is, in my opinion, one of the best books of the last couple of years. If this book were a movie (which I hope some day it WILL be), I would say that it kept me on the edge of my seat. I could not put this book down. If you are interested by the stories of the ancient astronauts, then this is the book for you."
2,Are all the previous reviewers relatives?,"I have read some of the previous reviews of this book, and it sounds as if they are reading a different book. I admit that I am a 'technical' guy, but even without that, there are limits.The basic premise is good, which is why I bought the book, BUT!!For exampel: 1) The US government can reconfigure an oil-drilling platform as an intelligence-gathering center and position it in the Gulf in 2 DAYS?2) The Tomahawk is a surface-to-air missile?etc., etc. Plus, the characters are pretty one-dimensional. I went to the TOR web site, but I couldn't find any place to send them my comments. If this is what the current book-buying publik wants, then I guess I'm going to save a lot of money."
1,"Domain, a novel of deep dumbness","Domain, a novel of deep dumbness.It took a month to read, but it seemed like years!I want my [$$] back! This book is one of the worse I've read.All the characters take turns at being dummies. The lead girl ismade to look almost retarded for most of the book.The main guy seems smart for a while and then gets real dumbfor most of the segments near the end.The last 300 pages of the 'original' book were obviously compressed intoabout 20 pages to shortened the book. It makes the ending soconvoluted, you can't make heads or tails of it.As I got near the end, I was so happy that I would soon be able to launch this... book into the trash can."
1,Too much bunky science,"I don't mind an adventure novel using a little bunky science to develop a plot, but this one preaches it and I just got tired of the long lesson at the first. He takes every way out theory about Egyptian pyramids and other monuments and throws them into a big soup. Like I say, if it didn't involve a big long lecture, and more adventure, maybe so."
2,Disappointment,"This book starts off with what seems like a good premise, but... there is no focus, no character building, and no clarity. I am a fan of Dan Brown books, which marry fact with fiction, and I am also a fan of other books of Domain's genre, and I love the idea of combining science with the spiritual, but this book was simply very poorly written. The plot eventually became so over-the-top that I just had to stop. Why waste any more time. This was my first Steve Alten book; I will not try another."
5,end of the world,steve alten's newest thriller is top notch although i prefer his shark stories this book is a must have it will make you wonder if the the mayan proficies are true good work steve i look forward to the next book
5,Can't Wait for the Sequel,"Alten obviously expended a tremendous amount of time researching the Mayans, the Nostradamic and Biblical prophecies, etc. to produce such a tight and suspenseful book. Like one reviewer pointed out, DOMAIN had the feel of an Indiana Jones movie, yet I found it much more fascinating on all levels. There wasn't a boring page in this book.The characters were well drawn out and interesting, especially Michael Gabriel and his father, Julius. Alten depicted their relationship well. The storyline was smooth and highly imaginative. I'm looking forward to the sequel, The Resurrection."
3,The Glory and the Pain,"Steve Alten is a very good writer; but telling a story is another matter. Probably the highlight of this forbidden archaeology/science fiction novel would be the ""journal entries"" of Julius Gabriel -- these alone are worth reading the book. However, the low points of this novel make for some horrendous reading. The pseudo-religious names/destinies of characters; the political landscape; the comic-book aliens; and the melodramatic love story are just painful. It's like reading what a thirteen-year-old genius would produce: naturally amazing, but lacking in experiential fundamentals. I would say read the book, for sure -- you will learn something about forbidden archaeology and the wonders of our planet, but for a novelization of these concepts? Beware."
2,"Good ideas, bad book","Every fiction author walks a fine line between realistic fiction and pure fantastic ""science fiction"". Steve Alten has failed to maneuver this line. While I enjoy books of both groupings- realistic fiction, and science fiction, I prefer them separate, and enjoy each on its own. Based on an intruiging idea, ancient civilizations, secret instructions, etc- It quickly crosses the line, and descends into a low-grade alien flick.Alten struggles to remain as realistic as possible in some areas- from political situations, to tedious army technology (each followed with intricate and irrelevant acronymns), to the precise dimensions of the ancient civilizations he has obviously stuidied extensively.All this work is undone, however, with the fiery depictions of cartoon-like aliens, cheap thrills, and shallow characters. The idea is great- but the performance itself isn't."
4,Hangs together fairly well...,"If you're a Steve Alten fan, you'll definitely like this one of his offerings. Unlike the MEG shark series, which is very fast paced but more intellectually ""breezy"", Domain requires a little more thinking on the part of the reader. Blending archaeological fact and speculative prediction, Domain hangs together fairly well as a summer read. And who knows?-you may just want to retain this book for its background information when 2012 actually rolls around!"
2,"Strong on Mayan facts, weak on psychological plausibility","Alten ties together a littany of Eric von Daniken facts about the pyramids, ancient Mayan ruins etc. and throws in a wild alien plot and an out of control protagonist's ego to save the world ...Zero for the use of hackneyed ancient trivia, several points for weaving a potentially interesting theory about the Yucatan peninsula meteorite, but in the end it falls apart because he has no clue about how to realistically write up psychological dynamics between his protagonist and heroine.There were shades of Lincoln-Preston here and there, but it does not deserve the comparison or the reference to those authors. This is not to say that Lincoln and Preston always get it right. They don't. But at least when they do - say in the way they mix science facts with historical fiction - they back it up with slightly better character research."
4,Keeps you up through the night!!,"Intelligent, well researched and very entertaining writing is the way I would describe Steve Alten's book Domain. It has taken the great story telling of Meg and the Trench and man's fascination with the end of the world theories that are rife through out all cultures. I really hope they make films of all his books soon. This is the first of a trilogy (something I think the author should have kept to himself) as the book stands up its own with its thorough research and great plot. A true story written by a great storyteller."
5,Wow! What a thriller.....uh....Hollywood?,"What can I say? I'm not usually an avid reader, but after Steve Alten's ""Meg"" and ""The Trench,"" I was more than excited to pick ""Domain"" up. I spent my time reading this on a plane from Pittsburgh to San Francisco and back, and even leaving the house to go out to the quiteness of the hayfields to finish it up. The book was so intense that I sometimes forgot that I was reading fiction. From the great (un)explained wonders of the world, the Mayan Calender, and to the Journals of Professor Julius Gabriel, I was convinced and terrified about the outcome. Thank the Lord for the characters Dominique and Mick. Steve Alten has to be one of the most talented and intellectual of all authors. He has really done his research and it is uniquely presented in this fine piece of work."
5,Fantastic,"After reading ""Meg"" and ""The Trench"" I anxiously awaited the release of ""Domain"". I wasn't disappointed. Alten weaves his story to include love story, adventure, and sci-fi. What more could a person ask for? I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to just relax and let their imagination run wild. Follow Mick and Dominique into a world of ancient history, evil politicians, and aliens.After reading this book, I felt like ""Oliver"" from the Dicken's novel. ""Please Sir, can I have some more?"""
4,Dan Brown just called to complain.,"Dan Brown must be wondering how to turn out his 3rd Robert Langdon book without copying too much from this book. Domain is very much Da Vinci Code-esque in terms of symbology and ancient cover-up. Steve Alten has done his homework and I appreciate all the research that went into this book.This book isn't a classic. It's just a good read. Worth every penny if you buy paperback.If you are going to Cancun for a vacation, this would be a perfect book to take with you. Enjoy"
4,Beautiful coat!,"I took the advice about ordering a size bigger, and mine is too big. I usually wear a medium but I ordered a large :-( It is a very nice coat wtih quality materials, but the fur definitely looks fake. For the price you really can't complain though!"
3,"Nice Jacket, but runs small","I just received this jacket. As the previous poster stated, it does run small. I ordered a Large and it fits very tight, good thing I am loosing weight! Order at least one size larger. Other than this, the jacket is very nice. It is warm, and not too thick. It is an excellent buy for the price as long as you know it runs a bit small. I can wear it with jeans as well as dressing it up."
2,size matters,"I like the coat, but the sizing is off a bit. Plan to go up a size than your regular size because it's a snug fit."
1,Coat Runs Much Smaller Than Size Indicates,"Hi,Purchased this item recently for myself. It is good quality, that is not the problem. This coat runs EXTREMELY SMALL. You will need to order at least 2 sizes bigger than you would normally wear."
2,Cheap Fur,"Fur doesn't look that great...and, like one of the other reviewers, I thought it ran true to size. Based on the other reviews, I ordered one size bigger, but it was too big. I probably would have kept it if it fit right, but since it was so large, back it goes!"
5,Stunning,Straight from the box this jacket was stunning. It was a gift to my Mom and she feels very elegant in this city coat. It truly was a great find!!! I made my Mom very happy. Thanks!
4,Runs small,Great jacket at an even better price. The jacket does run a bit tight. I'm a size 10 and the medium is snug. I can only wear a lightweight shirt underneath.
4,Beginning Of The End,"While I'll agree, that the balance of story and action come off as uneven in a few episodes, (the ratings were slipping at thetime, and the network felt that placing more emphasis on the action would help), I feel that it helps with the overall momentum towards ending the series.In the opening of just about every other episode in this volume, Kimble is literally on the run, and the Work-Hard-Play-Hard actor David Janssen REALLY looks the part of a haggard fugitive,having aged prematurely over the run of the show; I can honestly understand why he didn't wish to continue for another season!!Thankfully, the very few replacement music cues heard have been better blended into the audio mix, this time around."
5,My all-time favorite TV series,"I don't know (& can't discuss intelligently) what 'correct' incidental music cuts are included (or not ?). But, then I don't really care - the stories/ acting, etc... overide such minor detail. Anyway, I'm just glad - really glad to being very close to nearly having a complete non-bootleg ""Fugitive"" series. The Fugitive was/ is great TV, and this release proves it. Although this is part nostalgia/ memories of growing-up in the 60's - I think it still stands as a great Television series, regardless of additional (or not) detail some see as ""non-authentic"". Does anyone really remember the series well enough todissect every episode ? Still, I feel Columbia has done a fine overall job here. I wonder if David J. could have imagined there are some of us still watching his work; I wish I could have met him (if only to say I was sorry for that awfulmovie !)"
4,Series never jumped the shark -- but I can see a fin in the distance,"The series was great from start to finish; but its greatness did diminish a bit in the final season. The stories were not quite up to the standards of previous seasons. Also, the move to color was unfortunate. It's not that the color is a bad thing, per se; but, as someone noted, somehow when it went to color it seemed to be more obvious that everything was filmed in and around sunny LA, regardless of where Kimble was supposed to be. (For example, near the end of ""The Blessings of Liberty"", you get a glimpse of a boat in a harbor in the background. Prior to that, there was no indication Kimble was in an oceanside city. I'm not sure the boat and water would have been as noticeable in a B&W filming). I read somewhere there was consideration of a fifth season; I'm glad it was decided to wrap up this excellent series before then, when the shark certainly would have been closing in."
5,The fugitive,Watch every episode but mist the final episode when I was a kid so please tell me witch one has the final episodes so I can order that one.
4,Cute little gift!,This book is very cute and little. I gave this as a gift along w/an apple corer to someone w/apple trees in their yard. It made a sweet presentation. I thought about getting one for myself!
5,Simply the best,"This is simply the best watch IMO, that being said, not sure how many folks would actually want to go diving and potentially scratch/damage their Omega.Fit and finish is absolutly perfect, the bold face, wavy background and simple yet stunning lines are only appreciated by true watch lovers. Many folks think $1K+ is too much for any watch, they are simply wrong.On the flip note, I do have a Seiko dive watch SKX173 (also a fantastic watch)... that I do not mind banging and possibly damaging again, price does matter when it comes to rough sports.My TAG diver is also very nice but nothing compares to the Omega."
5,Omega Seamaster 2264.50.00,No problem ordering and receiving the watch quickly and with very reasonable shipping. Checked the serial number with Omega repair station and they verified the authenticity. Watch does not come with standard papers in box (from Omega) but Amazon guarentees for two years with their warranty. Saved about $500-600 dollars by purchasing from Amazon.com . Watch is doing well. Very satisfied at this point.
5,MSRP on this watch is $1700,"Great watch, however...The MSRP on this watch is only $1700. I've been to several reputable watch dealers in my area and all of them have stated the $1700 MSRP and then they all offer at least 15% off of that. Plus free lifetime battery replacement while you wait.Omega specifically recommends against buying their watches online as many are not authentic and will not be covered under warranty unless they are purchased from an authorized dealer."
1,Great... if you leave it in the box...,"A fool for the beauty of it, I purchased this Omega just short of a year ago. Thought I would have it for life. It stopped working last month after a day of simple recreational diving (and no, I did not open the helium-release valve). Today I heard from the Omega-listed customer service center that it would cost more than $1000.00 to repair. A 300 meter dive watch that didn't last 30? Please.... What use is a ""warranty"", if it will still cost more than half the original price to repair? Is this the level of customer service you would expect at this price? Not for most people, I would expect. This has nothing to do with the good service at Amazon. This has everything to do with Omega not standing behind their product. What a disappointment!"
4,Good little bulb,"The bulbs work fine, the only reason I didnt give them 5 stars is because you have to buy a two pack of bulbs when I needed only one."
1,too expensive,You can get them at most any auto parts store for around $3.99 for a twin pack.The bulbs themselves are very good and last a lot longer than the regular 921's.
1,Look Inside the Book?,"This ""book"" should become the classic example for avoiding any purchases of material which do not show their actual pages and layouts. It is equivalent to a second grader's attempt to create a book, not a reputible publishing house. The table of contents bleeds directly into the first poem. None of the poems are laid out by line, instead Quill Pen Press has elected to cram the maximum amount of 12 point type into each line in order to minimize the amount of paper required (all 18 sheets worth!). Without a previous familiarity with the poems herein, Kipling's meter and rhythem can only be guessed at. Worse, almost all of the poems, while short, are so compressed by the layout that they span two pages - and Quill Pen has elected to break internal lines of the poems.Learn from my mistake - avoid this edition (or anything else from Quill Pen Press for that matter) and purchase one that is compently formatted."
1,Disappointed,I specifically purchased this video because it was listed in the description that the June Taylor Dancers were featured on this particular show. This is not true. The June Taylor Dancers are no where to be found.
3,Interesting and different,"I bought this deck, because I have owned the book ""How to Read Tarot Cards"" by Doris Chase Doane and King Keys for decades. These cards have always fascinated me.But I also own other tarot decks and books, primarily from the Arthur Waite tradition and similar schools of thought.While there are overlaps in meaning, these two traditions are quite different. I can't reconcile them in my mind at all.Others: Swords = Air, Pentacles = EarthThese: Swords = Earth, Coins (Pentacles) = AirOthers: The Fool starts the cycle as 0 and AlephThese: The Fool is 22, and the Magus starts the cycle as 1 and AlephSo pick the tradition that corresponds to your understanding. But mix them carefully, if at all. They assign completely different astrological signs to the cards, which of course changes the meanings dramatically. I don't know that one is better than the other -- I just didn't expect them to be so different."
3,NUMBERS TOO SMALL !,Scale is OK -- Numbers are very hard to read as they are tooooooooooo small - Unless you have a telescope !
2,Dial too high above scale,"Its not evident from the photo but the dial is actually not flush with the scale, it is 4-5"" above, meaning that you have to slip your feet underneath the dial when you stand on the scale. This ruins the retro look. I was very disappointed and returned the product."
2,A good little book but could be much better,"This little book of about 6000 words is pretty good but could be better. The book contains a disproportionate number of technical and specialized terms and is somewhat noun-heavy. There is a pronounciation guide for every word, which is for the most part very distracting and considering how phonetic German spelling is, totally unnecessary. Finally, and probably most troublesome, is the fact that the verb tenses, irregularities, and noun plurals and irregularities aren't included. It's a good little book to have but you need a vocabulary of at least the most commonly used 15000 words at your command to really succeed in being able to live in a foreign environment. Other books, like ""10000 Worter"" seem to be more complete. One gets the feeling that the author isn't sure whether to make the book a vocabulary builder for folks dilligently learning the language or a phrasebook for travelers -- unfortunately, it doesn't really succeed either way."
5,Works very well,And it's gentle! One thing I dislike about other eye makeup removers is that they are oily! This one is NOT. You don't need a lot and it works very well.
1,Won't buy it again,"The product is a thick gel-like consistency, messy to use, and it didn't get my mascara off effectively - it ended up all over my cheeks. I was surprised because the Dermalogica products I've used have been much higher quality than this one. I won't buy it again."
2,Comparison with Memoirs of a Geisha,"After reading Memoirs of a Geisha I wanted more of Japan and Geishas, unfortunately this book was a dissappointment and lacks the imagination, romanticism and magic Memoirs of a Geisha has.The photos are quiet nice though, but I think Memoirs of a Geisha created more vivid images in the minds of those who read it.Mineko is just stating things as they happened with no depth.It just didn't pull me."
1,Geisha of Gion: The Memoir of Mineko Iwasaki,I ordered a book from WorldofBooksUSA. The book apparently arrived at my post office but was sent back by the post office to WorldofBooksUSA as I was out on deployment for several months and unable to retrieve the book. I emailed WorldofBooksUSA asking them to resend me the book that I had paid for but they refused. I also found a review of them not written by me claiming that they had given me satisfactory service. I would appreciate WorldofBooksUSA resending me the book that I paid for. Until then I would be wary of ordering from them.
1,Where's the comparison?,"I have read both ""Memoirs"" and this book and I just don't see any comparison at all. Things that Arthur Golden wrote about were said by him to be fiction, based on things that others told him. She wasn't the only geisha that he spoke to. I found Mineko a spoiled brat and very money hungry. She even comments that she didn't really care about taking care of her customers. All she wanted to do was dance. I couldn't enjoy this book because I disliked the author immensely. I find her too selfish and cold to give her praise for her book. Her litigation being won was, to me, another money making scheme. The more I read, the more I disliked her and her book."
2,This scale is neither precise nor accurate,"While this scale is definitely on the cheap side, I wouldn't use it to monitor the weight of a cat. You will be unable to spot weight changes any smaller than half a pound. Even though the readout is given in 2 ounce increments, placing the same weight on the scale several times in a row gives results as far as 4 ounces off in each direction."
5,Terrific jazz piano album,"I originally heard most of these cuts played on the great radio show on NPR ""Hot Jazz Saturday Night."" The music is perfect background for a relaxing Saturday evening with a cold beverage."
3,Mediocre,"Although this book calls itself a dictionary of religions, it also includes information on various terms used by the religions it talks about. It left out the Assemblies of God denomination to my annoyance, but did refer to them in it's entry on Pentacostals. The feel of the pages was wretched, that kind that makes it feel like your nails are scratching on chalkboard, so I rarely pick it up. It has some black and white maps inside, but they are printed onto the page rather then being the glossy type, and are not in color of course. Another problem I had is that it implies in various parts of the book that Earth is billions or millions of years old which of course is ridiculous (see Answers in Genesis or Why I Don't Believe which you can find via a link in my blog)."
5,A very uplifting book,"I cannot recommend this book too highly... There is everything in it; love, joy, fulfillment, exhilaration, achievement, renewed faith... and also, despair, disappointments, loss of faith... all said in the inimical way of A.J.Cronin.. a real worhthwhile book!!"
2,Bad Sound Ruins a Great Documentary,"I looked forward to watching this potentially excellent documentary of a period I have always been interested in. The narrator is a very knoledgeable professor, Bettany Hughes.However, the experience was ruined by the lack of, or totally bad, editing of the sound! I think I missed about half of the narrative of each episode.I believe that the producers of this documentary should re-edit this DVD and give everyone who made the mistake of buying it, a new copy with proper sound editing!"
1,A Real Disapointment,"My husband and I were really disapointed with this DVD. Our expectations were much higher. We are big fans of Ms. Hughes, and we have all her other DVD's. The audio was so terrible that you really can't hear her narrative. We do not like reading subtitles, which is an option with this DVD. The reinactments were so bad we could tell some of them were wearing Pendleton shirts. She must have asked for volunteers. Compared to the great quality of her previous DVD's, this was a real joke. I can't believe she put this out. She must need money? Please, Ms. Hughes, you are better than this pathetic attempt!!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!,"I'm a big fan of Bettany Hughes and have all of her other DVDs, so when I saw this video advertized on Amazon I ordered it immediately. Playing it, though, was a huge disappointment. Her narration is all but drowned out by the background sound effects, making the program unwatchable.Sad to say, if you're looking for something to do that's informative and entertaining, bang yourself in the side of your head with a slice of lemon wrapped around a brick - it'll be more satisfying than trying to watch the 'Roman Invasion of Britain.'"
2,Poor Audio,"As previous respondent said the audio made a hash of what was to be an otherwise interesting documentary. This is the same also for Michael Wood's India which also had very poor audio. Recommended for English history buff's only, who would sit through the garbled transmission."
2,Stick with the originals,"Although this is my favorite female r&b group, this album is over produced and does a disservice to the wonderful originals. I suggest ordering the Sony albums that include most of the originals included in this remix album."
3,why not... but...,"these are indeed songs not to compare with the original ones. if you like the sound of todays music and you also like these ladies i say 'why not'... but some songs are complete other songs with vocal samples of the group. there are some good ones too; ""year of decision"" and ""givin up givin in"" and ""dirty ol' man"" are remixed versions you certainly can play in the discotheque. ofcourse this my opinion and you have to make yours."
2,Yuck!,"What a major disappointment(and a personal waste of money) this was. I had to read the cover everytime a song played to see what title it was. I didn't recognize anything except TSOP and what a butcher job they did on that! The Three Degrees are way too talented to have their music corrupted by ""housing it up"" !"

5,"Great Tasting, Cold Coffee.","First, let me say I have never been a (cold) coffee drinker. While in Afghanistan these were made available in the dfac, Upon trying one I discovered I really like them, and drink them on a regular basis. I ordered them for my wife who is back home, and she really likes them also. I am not super sensitive to caffiene, but I can tell there is something in there, I do not recommend drinking right before bedtime. I really like the shape and size of the can. I would recommend to anyone who likes cold coffee or someone maybe wanting to venture to the other side, as was the case with me. ""Try it, you might like it"". Just a little note, if you like Mocha, that one is great also."
4,Great Pick-Me-Upper,The Battalion Command Sergeant Major turned me onto this coffee while I was in Iraq. It was a staple of the military field units. Great for a quick pick-me-up when you start to get that middle afternoon nod going. Problem is in the military it was free.Here at home you have to pay for it. Individual cans are hard to find in my area so I purchase via Amazon. The Shock Latte (and Mocha) are pricey but I believe well worth it. It needs to be well chilled and shaken before it is drinkable. Great flavor and very effective. I like it better than Starbucks or Red Bull and feel it is more effective. I'd have rated it 5 stars except for the per unit price.
4,1st Bank for 1st Grand-daughter,"I had previously bought 3 of these banks in blue for my 3 Grandsons. By the time my Grand-daughter was born, they were no where to be found. Search after search finally found the one pink bank on Amazon.com. The only thing I didn't like about it was the hearts on it...they were an unattractive color. So I just recolored each of them and now it is beautiful! It plays 'It's a small world' perfectly just like the blue banks do, and I paid the same price for it as I did the banks a few years ago...but I was disappointed when I had to add a high delivery price to it. Previously I had bought the banks in a local hospital gift shop."
2,Item does not play music,"Purchased this item for a grandchild. Already had the pink one for his sister that worked perfect. This one played music the first few times, then quit. Tried to contact manufacturer but with no results. Would not purchase another one of these from Amazon."
5,A FUN READ,"As someone who has much more experience with smoking marijuana than with growing it, I found this book to be informative and entertaining. Clearly, Ed is trying to expand his horizons with this book by reaching out to a completely new audience that approaches the subject in a more casual manner. The book has a great look to it and is filled with photos that work hand-in-hand with the text to give the reader as much info as possible in the simplest manner possible. The text avoids the statistics and elaborate details that characterize Ed's other books and sticks to the basics. Granted, this book is not for the ""professional"" pot grower but rather for the other 95% of us who have at some point considered growing their own weed. This book is perfect for the novice grower or anyone who has a casual interest in marijuana. To sum up, it's fun to read, has many pictures and is fast moving.BOSCO IN CA"
1,Raises more questions than it answers.,This is such an incomplete text on growing! If it had been a magazine article I might not have felt so cheated.
5,I like these planks!,"So far I have used one of each type of wood. The cedar adds a bit more flavor to fish than the alder does, however the alder seems to char less than the cedar does. Both are great for grilling your fish, I have not tried it on other types of meat. One tip though, ensure that the wood is not over any part of your flame or you will burn the plank. I soaked them for at least 4 hours prior to their use, so they were saturated. I recommend these to any grilled fish lover, it adds a very unique flavor to the fish - yum!"
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I got hooked on Grilling Salmon on the planks about a month ago and have done it at least 4 times so far. After grilling on Alder since Cedar was sold out at the local store I decided to get these on Amazon but they don't compare to the others I've used. I've been getting ""Fire & Flavor"" brand that's sold at my local store and these Nature's Cuisine planks are thinner. Even worse the Nature's Cuisine are rough with wood fibers on both sides (even after wiping them off) - to the point where it got in the food a bit. I don't know if I got a bad batch or not, but I can tell you that the ""Fire & Flavor"" always have one side smoothed out and even their 'rough' side is still smoother than the surface of these Nature's cuisine.Fwiw, after a number of side by sides, my wife and I both agree that we enjoy the Salmon grilled on the Alder over the cedar."
3,Great for grilling,The work great. Read the instructions on soaking the plank. Only thing is I did not receive the advertised cook book.
2,"Alas, New Evidence","Drew's argument depends on the chariot being a 2nd-millenium BCE invention, made in the Middle East and/or Anatolia.Unfortunately, recent archaeological digs in the Urals and Kazakhstan show that the chariot was inveted there -- in northern Central Asia and western Siberia -- no later than the 21st century BCE.And since the chariots discovered in these graves were fully developed, the date may well be much earlier -- as far back as 3000 BCE, perhaps.The attempt to date the entire Indo-European expansion to as late as 1600 BCE is also rather ludicrous."
4,Great Book,"The two reasons I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is 1. the description on the back of the book is totally misleading. This is a paranormal romance and the paranormal aspect seems to come out of nowhere and 2.The other point of views that came up near the end of the book were a bit distracting. I would've preferred to switch POVs throughout the entire book or not at all.Overall, it was a fun read. Although I wasn't expecting the paranormal aspect I enjoyed it. I did find myself rooting for the main characters to get together in the end. Although some of the situations were ridiculous, it was clear that this was supposed to be a fun novel that didn't take itself too seriously. If you just want to have a fun, light, paranormal read, you should enjoy this book."
1,Book jacket/cover is misleading!,"This was undoubtedly one of the worst books I have ever read. The jacket cover describes three single girlfriends that are seeking a man to marry...Not true...! I won't spoil it, but when you are still married...you shouldn't be seeking your next husband. The book also has a paranormal twist--and unless you are an occult worshipper--for the most part you won't have a clue about some of the things that are going on. If you like the bizarre, this is for you...If you are seeking a book that you can follow, and that is of the real world--keep looking!"
4,A pretty good read.,"I enjoyed this book, it was different but romantic and touching. However, it is definitely not for the close-minded or uber religious."
2,Lost & Never Found,"If I had checked the reviews for this book before I started trying to see how Luby would find Mr. Right, I would have left it on the shelf! I am not a fan of the paranormal genre so I was not a happy reader. The only character who got rid of any one and may have found Mr. Right was Danni! I'm still shaking my head on this one! I am going take my time before I read anything else by this author. I'm sure Ms. Jackson is an awesome writer. I just didn't select the right on that reflects her talent."
2,I probably would have loved it if I knew what it was about,"This book is nothing like the description. So much so, that I read the description 5 times after I just started reading the book. I actually books with occult themes, murder, and romance. So, I probably would have loved it if I knew that this what the main theme was. But because I didn't, I spent most of the first 100 pages confused. I did enjoy the story overall. Just don't be fooled into thinking this is about 3 ""sistahs""."
1,Demonic Romance - Horrible Theme,"Rarely do I give a review and this is the first bad review that I have every written. Ms. Jackson is a a very talented writer but I don't know what happened with this book. I was sooooo disappointed with the romance/voodoo/suspense theme. I am not into witchcraft and this book focused a lot about the ""darkside"" and demons. I was truly not feeling this particular book and if I could have given it no stars then I would of done it. This demonic theme was all about sex and demons and very little about the foundation of the relationship. The secondary characters were not necessary in this book but had enough drama for their own seperate novel. You will be better off waiting for this book at a garage sale or library. I actually put my book in the garbage and wish that I could get a refund for the cost of this book and the time that it took to read this horrible book."
5,Putting the Story Back in History,"Brands does a great job of weaving the lives of Austin, Santa Anna and others together in a compelling fashion. His vivid narrative style makes you forget you are reading history, but rather makes you feel you are sitting around a fireplace listening to a master storyteller perform his craft with grace and ease."
5,Excellent Book,"I would like to highly recommend ""Lone Star Nation"" by H.W Brands. Brands packs a ton of detail into a large book and writes it so it is very easy to read. I must say that this was one of the books that kept you on the edge of your seat and you didn't want to stop reading. Brands explains very well the situation in Texas and how it developed and then peaked with the arrival of Santa Anna. Anyone interested in American history would like this book. It is a must read."
5,A Film I Watched Three Times Already,"I consider myself to be a very picky film viewer, for lack of a better term. Saw this movie on Sundance a few days ago, DVRed it, like i do all movies, so i can give them a 10 minute trial run, so as to not waste time. Just couldn't ""put this one down,"" even over the protests of my wife, who wanted to watch something insanely boring, like 24. =) Quirky and eccentric are two qualifications I have for a movie, and Talent Given Us has plenty of both. The characters are all quite ordinary, yet endearing in their own ways. And the very loose script kept my attention for the duration. You either will love this film or hate it--I loved it."
4,An interesting listen,This album is the gig the band played with the Royal Ballet dancers of Sweden in 2002. A nice run through of mostly newer songs with a much better sound than their earlier live album. A few slower moments on the album but worth it for the parts where the band kicks into a higher gear.
1,Anti-Catholic Bigotry,"I was blindsided by this latest McGarr mystery (I`ve read all the others). I`m not sure why Gill decided to smear the Roman Catholic Faith along with the soon to be Saint Escrivo!! He must not believe he will be judged someday. He makes the Opus Dei ,its founder and,by inference the Pope (see Frontispiece) appear to be the Mafioso arm of the Catholic faith.He even took a swipe at Pope Pius XII with the false accusations concerning the Holocaust (I guess the estimate by Jewish scholars the he saved over 800,000 Jews during the Second World War doesn`t impress Gill). I recommend the book to Catholic-bashing bigots. He`s lost me as a fan and reader."
4,original author,"Late Bartholomew Gill was a remarkable author. His skillful books were'nt your run of the mill mysteries. As an erudite man with strong but thoughtful opinions , he wrote complex, often dark and distressing novels. In this book he goes after Opus Dei, fundamentalist, fanatical religious order known for murky misdeeds all over the world. And how strange that after writing such a a book, perfectly healthy man manages somehow to fall through the window in his house and die. Makes you wonder."" The Death of an Irish Sinner"" is a gloomy and bloody book that shatters both, the world of the main character and of the not so humble reader. Mr. Gill will be sorely missed for courage and originality, two traits so rare in the wreck of the world we live in."
2,"It worked, but my fish did not like it.","The first time I used it, I used it according to directions. I counted out 14 drops for my 10 gallon tank. It cleared within a couple of hours, and then the next day, the algae bloom was back, so I waited three days, like the directions said, and put in another 14 drops, and the next morning, my fish were all lying on the bottom of the tank. When they didn't respond to even food by noon, I got them out of the tank and put them into our quarantine tank until my husband could come home and completely empty and clean everything in the 10-gallon tank. I would not use this again. I hope my fish will be okay. After several hours, they seem to be coming around. If they die, I will write back with an update not to use this product."
4,algae fix,I have two small ponds and this really helps with the string algae. I would recommend it to anyone.
3,A slow to no-read....,"The best books produced by AB Simpson were written by his protege, AW Tozer. Although it was the ministry and teachings of Simpson which inspired Tozer, it is Tozer who brings these thoughts to life, and whose writing is easy to follow and interesting enough to stay with.I greatly admire AB Simpson as a founder of the Christian Missionary and Alliance Church, and as a man who was dedicated to knowing and serving the Lord. But if you truly want to enjoy learning what he knew, let AW Tozer be the one who explains it to you.Three stars for subject matter and out of respect for the man....not because this book was easy or enjoyable to read. So far I've been unable to finish one of Simpson's books."
4,The definative beadwork book...,"I would consider this to be the holy grail of beadwork books, if it were not only avalible in Russian. Even with the language barrier it is pretty close to perfect. There are some really amazing project ideas in it (pictures), as well as amazing pictorial step by step instructions. It is possible to follow the pictures easily even without being able to read the text. Its perfect for more experianced beaders, but not for beginners(unles they read russian) where some written text and tips to follow would be useful for them."
5,great book for toddlers learning to talk + read,"i purchased this book after getting it out of the library -- and my two little boys love it! i have a 2 1/2 year old and a 15-month old and they love looking at the pictures and pointing to everything and (trying to) say what everything is...every time we read it, they find something new to look at or talk about. the kids love the sesame street characters + all of the different scenes inside the book: from a construction site to the airport to the bathroom to the house with the different seasons. it is NOT a recent publishing (so some of the ""newer"" characters like abby are not in it). this is a definite keeper in my kids' book collection...we read it almost every day!"
4,Very convenient and handy,"It is the perfect size for my everyday use. Great to saute vegetables etc. Easy maintenance, cleaning etc."
3,third time is the charm,I ordered this product and when I received it the top could not fit the pot because the pot was warped. The replacement came and the top would not stay down in the pot. Finally on the third order I got one that I could use. I like the size of the pot and I enjoy using it. I just wish it would have worked the first time.
1,Not good one. Losses nonstick material after an year.,Pros:-Works as expected.Food does not stick to the bottom. Food cooks well and evenly.Cons:-Works for an year without any issue and after that you have to throw it away.It starts loosing it nonstick material as small black material. This mixes with food so you won't even identify initially.It took me some time to find out the issue. Mixing food with the nonstick material that is bad for health.Better to buy good Stainless Steel Cookware.
5,This saucepan is going to get a ton of use!,"The Circulon 4-quart covered sauce pan is just what I've been looking for! The non-stick bottom is a great perk and the clear lid is perfect for avoiding those surprise boil overs. This pan is just the size for eggs, pancakes, or simmering vegetables. It is that uncommon medium sized pan that every cook should have!"
5,The Perfect Pan!,"I have been looking everywhere for this pan with a lid and finalluy found it through Amazon. The dept. stores had it ""on sale"" but it was never in stock.It's the best pan and you can see-through and put it in the oven.."
3,circulon 10-1/2in/4 qt. covered sauteuse,"I purchased it several weeks ago from Amazon and used only once.I like the size and how it looks...But I was a bit disapppointed because it is quite lighter than the most of other pans I use. G. Miller, Fairfax, Va.Item being reviewedCirculon 80486 10-1/2-Inch/4-Quart Covered Tapered Sauteuse"
4,Love it!,"This is a very nice pot. NON-Stick and very easy to clean. I agree, the handles do get hot, but thats easy to live with for me. I plan on buying more of these, maybe the whole set. For a nice solid cooking pot, this is it."
3,Heat on handles+cooking well=???,This product cooks food very well.The only bad part is that when you cook something you cannot hold onto the handles to make sure it is steady while you stir food or something like that. The handles heat up VERY quickly. You can only use it if you have mitts otherwise you will burn yourself.
4,Excellent Value.,"This pan is just what I was looking for. It has wonderfully even heating, holds a lot, and cleans like a breeze. I also love the double handles for ease of use. The only thing I would change is that the handles do get hot and I was used to a pan where I didn't have to worry about that. But I got used to it quickly and can't get over the value for this great pan!"
4,I love it,This is a great product. I have used it several times. The thing I like most is you can use it in the over or on top of the stove. I cooked a roast in it in the oven and the roast was so tender you could cut it with your fork.
5,ITS a great bargain and it cleans up great,This is one great kitchen tool to cook with.The clean up is really easy. Great product
1,Profit on demand,"This book was written by a professor of economics at theUniversity of Houston Clear Lake. Apparently he makes every classread this book. It was written as educational material. As economic material goes it is full, as for plot, it is empty. Why did Dale C. write this book? To give his students an alternative method of learning...? The basic premise of the book is that two professors of economics go on extravagant vacations with the money they make selling their text book. They end up at a hotel in Florida. While they are there they bore all the other vacationers with economic discussion. One of the hotel guests is then murdered. The two professors feeling it is their obligation try to solve the murder using economic principles. I won't spoil the ending, you'll have to be disappointed on your own. My main question about the situation is why was the book written under a pen name...?"
4,It really is super quiet,"Purchased for a space heater but was concerned that the fan would interfere with listening to the TV. However the fan is super quiet and while listening to the TV, cannot be heard. The heat produced is also pretty good"
2,It didn't work well,The thermostat didn't work well in the automatic setting. It didn't heat at all no matter how many times we tried following the instructions
5,Very quiet and powerful.,"The first reason I love it is the quiet design. And it's very powerful. When I bath my baby, I put this in the bathroom to make her warmer. I can feel the warm as soon as I turn it on. Highly recommend this for small bedroom, office, bathroom, etc."
2,A few problems,"I bought this heater in December '07.On the plus side:It's quiet.It puts out a good amount of heat when it's on.On the negative side:The thermostat is quite inaccurate. Its 80 degrees is more like 72 degrees.There is no way to keep the heater on all the time. Even in non-thermostat mode, it shuts itself off when the room temperature reaches 75 degrees. It will not turn itself on again until the room cools down AND the heater is turned off then back on.After about 3 months, the single control button started malfunctioning. It either will not register a push or registers multiple pushes per per push. It makes operation an annoying guessing game.I don't recommend this heater."
2,I am disappointed,"Yes it heats and the low speed is quiet, but the instructions say-don't us in a bathroom, and the marketing says the bathroom is one of the good uses.The thermostat function, seems not to do anything. The heater does not turn on when it is selected.I am disappointed that Amazon would sell anything that so blatantly fails to perform some of its promised functionality."
5,Great Heater,This heater is really whisper quiet and the controls are very easy to access. I would certainly recommend this heater to others.
4,Great Heater,"I just purchased this Holmes Heater fan today. My office is very cold and has cold air blowing all the time. I put the heater under my desk on high. For the first time in a week, I'm warm! You can't hear it running AT ALL. Can't smell it running at all. You just feel warmth! I'm so glad I purchased this one."
1,Don't buy this product!,This product does not perform as stated! The temperature control does not work and it gives very little heat. I took it back two days after I received it; which meant packaging it and waiting in line to send it back!
4,Does the job well!,Bought this for one of our rooms that gets really cold in the winter. So far I am impressed by how well it heats up the space. Definitely a worthy investment.
1,"No heat, no fan noise","There is no doubt that this is a quite machine. There were two reasons for that, however. The first is that the fan is quiet; the second is that its thermostat would not allow the heater to run long enough to put out any significant heat. I returned the unit to Amazon."
3,I have two and one is not working as well,"I have two that got about 3 or 4 years ago. I have one in my office and I use it all day (every day of the week) and works great. The other one is at home and about a month after i got it, the button stayed in an odd position, however it worked just fine but now the sensor is not working and it turns off or it thinks you are pressing on it so just changes temperatures. It is odd. Any way the one at work I just love the one at home I hate. So I guess I am 50/50 on this product."
1,Unfortunately it broke after a few days,"It only lasted a few days then it wouldn't heat, and a few days later the fan gave out. The company sent me a different model heater as a replacement under warranty, which works good, but as for this particular heater, it wasn't good for me."
4,"QUIET, QUIET, QUIET!! OK, switch could be better.","This heater is the quietest heater on the market. To me, this is one of the most important features of a portable space heater. 99% of all portable space heater on the market have noisy, some unbearably loud fan noise. With this model, I can use it in the bedroom and not be bothered by the fan noise. Yeah, the thermostat might not be NASA accurate but it works fine. If you don't like it, just use the manual high/low heat setting. I've been using 4 of them in my house for last 7 years, continuously in the winter. One died last year, other three are working fine. I agree with other reviewers that switch design could be better but it's not a deal-breaker for me."
1,The worst,I had my secretary order this heater for my office. It never worked from day 1. I've tried every possible setting and it will only turn on for about a min before it shuts off and never comes back on again. It doesn't stay on continuously on the Low or Hi settings like it's supposed to either. I'm having her return it. Total junk!
2,Issues with automatic temperature control,"temperature control did not work, I got a replacement and it also had the same issue. But I kept it because it was quiet, I moved the thermistor from inside the unit to outside and it works fine now."
5,It's so QUIET!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!,"I LOVE THIS LITTLE HEATER!!!! It really is whisper quiet. I have 4, one for each room. Saves money big-time as apposed to my central heating. Warms very nicely AND IT'S SO QUIET!!!! I LOVE IT, ILOVE IT, I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! I love it!"
2,Not Well Designed,"This heater is over designed and inconvenient to use. It heats your space as well as any other personal heater, but the thermostat provides no additional control over an ""On/Off"" switch. And the handle grips on the sides give you no leverage at all in moving it around. It takes both hands to pick it up which is very awkward - especially if the heater is under your desk. I purchased two other heaters from different manufacturers at the same time and they are far easier to manage because they have handles on top. They were also less expensive and provide the same heat output. This one isn't worth the extra cost."
4,A Neater Heater,Very nice compact product. Powerful for such a small unit. I like the fact that you can pre-set the tempeture desired.Great for comfort.
4,new heater works,We just purchased this and are very happy with it.We find it to very good at taking chill off a area.
5,Perfect little heater.,"I am 100% satisfied with this heater so far.- Quiet: It's absolutely silent. When I had the heater set to automatic thermostat, I never heard it come on, I would only feel the warmth.- Warmth: Good lord this little thing puts out a lot of heat! 98% of the time I use it on low.- Size: It's very small. Perfect for the office environment.- Settings: The thermostat setting actually works. I've only used it once but I do recall that I began feeling chilled then all of a sudden I felt the warmth of the heater kick in. Granted, I'd read the bad reviews about the setting so I had it up to 80 to make sure it would come on at all.I've had this heater for about a month now and couldn't be happier."
2,Quiet but that's it,"The thermostat is my big problem with this heater. I have it on 80, but I know the room temp is well below that (about 68-70) and it still won't cycle on. When it does come on, it stays on for less than a minute. I bought this at my local store for $39, not through Amazon. But I just had to check out the reviews here to confirm that the thermostat problem was not just specific to my heater. I'm returning this anyway."
2,Thermostat mode is a JOKE and an AFTERTHOUGHT!,"There are much better working heaters out there for the money. I've had the Holmes 'One-Touch' for over a year now, and although it does provide OK heat in manual (constant on) mode, it does not work well at all in thermostat mode. The unit turns on for only perhaps a minute or two, then shuts off for a much longer period of time. It does not seem to have a temperature sensor to control the unit's thermostat, and thus keep an area heated properly. The unit would have been better off if it had a timer, where you could set it to let's say turn on for 5 minutes, then off for 10, or whatever else time intervals you would need to properly keep your area heated. This is a major shortcoming, since you don't want to keep your space heater on constantly for long periods of time (fire hazard), and you must rely on a thermostat or timer mode to keep the unit on in intervals."
1,Dangerous Product -- Do Not Buy!,"I bought this heater about six weeks ago. One morning I turned it on, and saw sparks and smoke pouring out of it. Luckily, I was there and could turn it off. Otherwise, it would have started a fire.I called Holmes immediately and they seemed unconcerned about this matter.It is unlikely that mine is the only heater that may catch on fire. Consider yourself warned!"
4,Holmes heater,"This has been a nice space heater to use. It has manual low, manual high, and thermostat temp auto settings,. This is the quietest heater I've ever had. It doesn't put out tremendous heat but it works alright. I own two different Holmes heaters, and I like both."
5,No Noise Please,"This heater warms the room very evenly; my husband and I use it in our home office (12 x 14 room). We have tried many different heaters only to find them either too noisy or too directional leaving parts of the room too hot or cold. This small in size heater puts out plenty of heat and has a very, very, small sound level that is actually pleasant for background noise while reading or doing computer work. We were so impressed that we bought a second one for our bedroom. We have lowered our furnace temperature and now use the heater to keep individual rooms comfortable. We both feel it is a good product and would recommend it to friends or family.Feeling Warm In Minnesota"
2,Thermostat Has Never Worked,"I purchased this unit off season -so I paid a fraction of the 39.99 being asked here.The thermostat has never worked on the unit -only the continuous HI / LO settings. (I got sick, forgot about it and the 30 days to return it expired -never thought about the warranty). I use this unit in a rarely used 4X6 bathroom. This unit is cumbersome, fat and not easy to grip to pick up and transport to another space. So, even though the functions are not all operable, I've found a practical use for it. The unit is relatively quiet -much quieter than their HFH442. It would probably be a very useful unit if the thermostat were operable."
2,"Gives infrequent, insufficient bursts of warm air","I got this at Rite Aid to keep me warm at night. I specifically chose this fan heater because of its thermostat feature so that my room wouldn't get too hot overnight.I tried setting the thermostat to 70 degrees, but when that didn't satisfy me, I set it to 80 on high. This thing behaves ridiculously. It'll turn on for a minute or so, but then it'll off for about a half hour before starting up again. Even with it set at 80 degrees, the room can't have been more than 72 degrees when I awoke in the morning. I don't think it ever gets up to 80 degrees before shutting off again. I'll be returning this to the store.The 1 Touch control sounds simple and convenient, but it's actually a bit of a hinderance to have to cycle through a dozen options. A plus is that the fan really is considerably quiet (though, on low, it has an eerie buzz to it)."
1,Horrible,"Let me tell you the sequence of events for me with this heater. 1) I opened the box. 2) I plugged in the heater. 3) I turned the heater on. 4) It immediately switched off and never turned back on. What an absolute waste of time and money, this is horrible. Don't buy this product because it has an automatic switch off that you can't turn off. The thermostat thing is wrong and you can't fix it or override it."
5,Poignant Memories,"This incredible album is one I have always loved. I have played it 100s of times in Ireland and here at home. In the Green Fields of France, their voices evoke deep feelings about the waste, uselessness and sadness of war. The words, melody and voices combine in a way that gives me pause as I watch life pass, by recalling that the ultimate sacrifice for country occurs in a split second---and persists in the pain of those who loved the lost ones for tens of years afterwards. The other tracks are equally moving."
3,Great for teens/young adults,Every young person who wants to truly live a pure and holy life should be exposed to this work.
5,Track Listing,"Great item. A wonderful piece to have in your collection.Track Listing:LOS GRANDES VALSES VIENESES1. Sangre Vienesa2. Vals del Tesoro3. Sueños de Primavera4. Amor, Vinos y Canto5. Oro y Plata6. Cuentos de los Bosques de Viena7. Danubio Azul8. Vida de Artista9. Ondas del Danubio10. Vals Emperador11. La Tempestad12. AdiosAMOR, BAILE Y VIOLINES13. Hasta Mañana en la Luna14.

5,great stuff,great itema and easy to make. came out with 11% aclohol and still great taste. buddies tried it and loved it.
4,"Tastes great, mixes well","Tastes great, mixes well, and no digestion problems. I usually use it after coming home from a bike ride, mixing it with some Whey powder. I'm pleased with it."
5,Great for fructose free eating!,I was so excited to find a product I could use with my new way of eating.
5,One of the most important books of this age,"This book is one of the most enlightening books I have ever read. It holds true to the words ""The truth shall set you free."" I had the opportunity to speak to Mr. Davis years ago and it is evident that he was being guided by the highest Source when he wrote this book. He said he received the information through contemplation. My husband was so inspired by the book he entered the whole thing into his computer in case there ever would be a time the book was no longer available. This book will truly help anyone free themselves of the programming that we all have been subjected to for centuries."
4,Wonderful animation of the biblical Noah's ark,"I purchased this DVD for the Wednesday evening Children's class at my church, as we're currently studying stories in Genesis. This is biblically accurate, the animation is classic, and the narration by James Earl Jones excellent. The children seemed to really enjoy it and were able to put visual pictures with the story we have been discussing."
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased a dolphin fairy wand several years ago at a health and wellness fair. Though I felt it was rather expensive, and the name is terrible, it has been one of the best massagers I have ever used let alone owned. It is POWERFUL, sometimes too much so. You have to be careful when using it on someone elses' back as it can feel like your being beaten to death. However, it does a fine job at loosening stubborn and painful muscle knots and does wonders for my feet. I would recommend it wholeheartedly."
1,Looking for a replacement,"Poor replay---skips---freezes and emmits noises from inside as if confused. If I could reach the seller, I`d ask for an upgrade since I want to be able to play all types of discs as described on the box. I have a large number of archived DVD's on DVD+/-R and RW discs which this thing just freezes up on. One of the other reviewers has given me a source for a substitute....chuckonechuck@bellsouth.net"
1,Not recommended,"I purchased this RCA product over a year ago, and I am very disappointed in it. The picture will freeze during the movie, followed by a tracking noise like the laser is looking for the track. It will often skip scenes. Since the product is over a year old, I don't think it is worth repairing (probably cost more to repair than replace, and I don't want to replace it with the same product). I purchesed a Minitek portable DVD player for my daughter at about 2/3 the price, and it works much better. I agree with the first reviewer. I, too, will never buy another RCA/Thompson product."
1,Beware - This unit has no Warranty,"My unit failed after using it three times over a 2 month period. I emailed RCA, they told me to call Thomson (a long distance call) to handle this warranty claim. I was told after 25 minutes on the phone that, even though I have a 90 day warranty, it wasn't covered. I now have a $350.00 paper weight. You decide for yourself, but I shall no longer purchase any RCA products."
2,Three Tenors Live,Not a dvd audio - disc so don't buy if this is what you are looking for - sound OK in DTS
1,don't waste your money,"One of the worst DVD-A disc I ever come across. Sounds very flat. If sound one holds a microphone to a MP3 player and record it, it would have sounded better than this."
1,Ever wondered what it would be like to read Animal Farm if MiniTruth got ahold of it?,"All these people who wrote good reviews are insane, or shamelessly politically biased.This book is Animal Farm, if you are a employee of Immi Truth from 1984. They are rewriting history people, and marketing a socialist ideal to our childeren.George Orwell must be rolling around in his grave.INGSOC is going after your childeren."
4,READ THIS FIRST,"I just want to warn you that a lot of the reviews on this Web site have major spoilers, so proceed with caution. I loved this show when it was on the air and really enjoyed watching them again. I would have given it five stars, but DVD extras are weak."
3,Too heavy,"Well, the movie indeed made me feel but feel sick. Don't take me wrong - this is a very good piece of work, great acting, music, atmosphere but it's just too heavy for my taste. Well maybe I shouldn't have watched it every night... If CSI and other standard criminal series are too light-hearted for you and you crave for gore not only physical but deeply psychological this one will be just it. For me there's too much suffering and problems in the real world to watch this series as ""entertainment"". It's just too real and horrifying."
5,BEST TV SHOW EVER,"This is the best tv show ever aired i guess thats why it was cancelled,its not a comedy or a reality show,it had to go because it wasn't for wives and kids anything for men has to be approved by a woman audience,anyway this show had great acting,great plots and it always kept you guessing about the next show even if it showed a preview better than XFILES which started to focus too much on the agents and not the subject like this show did,i wish there were at least 2 more seasons."
5,Millennium - One of TV's Best.,"Millennium is one of my favorite television shows of all time. Nothing out there has ever been able to compare to its well-written and thought provoking storyline. Fox really let a lot of fans down when they canned the series unexpectedly, years ago, as we expected a possible fourth series that never showed up. Fortunately, the series ended with a pretty decent final scene, but there are many loose ends that remain a mystery. It's a shame that it took so long for Fox to release this on DVD. Thought the first season of the series is definately my favorite, I sincerely hope that the second and third season get released as well. I've seen every episode of the series (several times), and I look forward to watching it on DVD again."
5,simply one of the best shows ever on tv,"season one and two of this series where amazing! I have been waiting years for this release. Gritty, realistic and sometimes actually scary. The soundtrack is a wonder as well...for 41 dollars, will not be dissapointed..."
5,Great TV program translates well to DVD,"I cannot recommend this offering too highly. Fans of the genre will thrill at the artistic use of white out, fade-in, background music and shock. The acting is superb, the writing is impeccable. All together this is possibly the greatest DVD set I have ever had the pleasure of viewing."
3,Good Partner to the X-files,"I never watched a single episode of Millennium while it was on TV but recently finished my collection of The X-Files and was looking for more Chris Carter, so I picked up the 1st season of Millennium. It did not blow me away at first, but I was certainly intrigued. As I watched I found that I did enjoy this series, though not quite as much as the X-Files. The reason for the 3-star rating is mainly because while I enjoy the one-off, serial killer of the week, format, I am a big fan of mythology arcs. If this season had focused a bit more on mythology it would have earned another star. That said, the few episodes that were hinting at an underlying, connected story we among my favorites, and the episodes leading up to the finale were quite good. I have season 2 ready to go and am excited to check it out, espeically since I have heard that it is more focused on the mythology of the Millennium Group. If you like Chris Carter or the X-Files, give this show a shot."
1,"Great Set, but Fox says NO Season 2 and 3 coming for U.S.","I love this series, and I give the season one set five stars, but wrote to Fox about when we could expect season two and three and this is the answer I got:Hello,Fox has no plans to release the title in question [Millennium Season Two and Three] at this time. I will forward your request onto our corporate office so they can see what the public would like to see on DVD.Thank you,Fox Consumer------------Thus I can not recommend you purchase this set unless Fox commits to releasing the remaining two seasons --- and soon! Season one ends on a cliffhanger, and it is disgusting that Fox intends to make us wait for an indefinite amount of time to conclude the series, and they may not release them here.I would urge you to write Fox and demand the release of the final two seasons as soon as possible. Otherwise, I would not purchase the first season."
5,My Word How Do They Do It?,"this season is amazing!!! Chris Carter has surpassed himself! the episode start of fairly tame. a few murders here and there and it's pretty much ur standard mystery thriller series. as the episodes progress, you see more and more that there's something not normal going on in all of these cases. a few unexpected twists and no weak episodes at all make this one of the greatest t.v. accomplishments ever. im just going through season 2 now and it's looking good!!! BRING ON MORE!!!!"
5,The soul of what is possible-GONE?DVD all 3 series-PLEASE!,"I hope that fans alike of Carter's work on Millineum, will make their voices heard to the highest.I have waited 4 years!Please bring out a box set of all the season's, there are more of us out here than you may think is marketable.This was the pinnacle, the apex, the touchstone of concept, writing that could and did blow away the dross that was/is being passed off as ""creative vision"" in TV AND CINEMA, both then and today....Bring it out, to us Chris. those who have active cerebellums.Fox nickel and dimers may you rot in Gehanna, if you keep this from the masses."
5,Nothing Else Comes Close,"The first time I saw this show, I was watching an X-File rerun at midnight on FX channel. I actually fell asleep about 20 minutes into that X-File ep, and when I woke up a few minutes after 1:00 a.m., and was reaching for the remote to turn off the tv, Millennium suddenly came on. The episode was ""The Mikado,"" and two minutes into it I shook off my comatose state and was riveted for the next hour. Actually, for the rest of the night, because the show was so compelling, I could not stop thinking about it until the sun came up and never went back to sleep. That was the start of my obsession, and I was setting my alarm for 1:00 a.m. every night thereafter until FX took the show off the air. If ever there was a series worthy of a DVD box set - this is it."
4,The Millenium The Complete First Season,"This was a 90s series I believe which I watched much of it on tv but had been awhile and enjoyed so thought would be fun to watch at my leisure. It tells of a man (Frank Black) who is married with a child, who came later in their lives, who used to work for the FBI and does no longer. He now works for a special group called the Millenium Group. He has ""flashes"" or intuitives which he sees in his mind's eye (psychic I say) that helps him see the past and feel the past/present/future with his expertise makes him a great profiler. He is sickened by the evil people do and is comforted by his family. His wife is a social worker and sometimes they work together. A very loving family. I really enjoy the show and look forward to watching all 3 seasons at my leisure. There are many shows 24 or so in each season."
3,Good beginning...,Good beginning series. It sets the tone (very dark) early and sets up teh characters well. Unfortrunatley the series just meanders mostly through unconnected episodes for far too long and only comes back on track right at the end.
5,The Best Kept Secret Masterpiece Series,"A brilliant series which never caught on because you actually had to WATCH the show. The episodes are dark, moving, and disurbing. This show took risks and chances and they paid off. Each episode is a multi-layered masterpiece which can be watched over and over. I rarely buy DVD series but pre-ordered this as soon as I saw it was for sale. Worth every cent.Chris Carter is considering a Millennium movie.I understand Season 2 and 3 are coming out in the UK (region 2). What's the deal? Where's the US releases?? C'mon? Who releases 1 season and quits?"
5,Wait... Worry... Who Cares?,"I have waited for years for this, and here it is, at last!This DVD set is worth every penny for any fan of Millennium and Chris Carter. The video and audio are great and the extra features are informative and interesting. Its everything I hoped it would be.With the second and third season also slated for release this year, it looks like 2004 will be a very good year indeed for Millennium fans."
5,like looking through a crystal ball.......,"Millennium, season 1, was way ahead of its time when it premiered way back in '96; it gives you the kind of quality television that is usually reserved for the premium channels. I'm talking about high production values, great acting & writing. Lance Henriksen 'becomes' Frank Black---- in what has become his signature role to date. This series speaks of the end-times, terrorism (before it became fashionable to have a 'war on terror'), good and evil, God, corruption, redemption & cultural dysfunction. This series is reserved for adults who can appreciate it. Seasons 2 & 3 are also must buys to complete your collection."
4,little known giant,"Randy caldwell is one of a rather large group of very versatile musicians who play out of New York, when they are lucky enoughto play at all., who is very underated and is truly a great find to those of you who remember Wes Montgomery a la Kenny Burrell. This very swinging CD is a great intro to a very tight blues oriented guitar player. I highly recomend it, and only hope he gets more oportunities to record on his own."
2,"The History, not the Future of the brain","The book is fine for a history of the brain, phylogenetically and ontogenetically (see the other reviews), but it is limited and outdated on the future of neuroscience."
3,Roy Rogers Fan,"I have recently received a copy on DVD of this film and for the first few minutes I was not impressed by the films quality, however as time wears on you do not notice it too much. Overall for the price you can't expect too much, but the film is worth buying and watching. Hopefully more titles will be released.From what I have in my collection so far, this budget series are unlike more expensive labels, uncut versionsand you do a decent DVD cover."
2,Good Book,"This is just a little book about the first couple years of fort gibson,OK football. First pages consist of a small narrative of the forst seasons, then it transistions into game stats. At the end is a summary of each player and what they ended up doing after graduation. If anyone happens to find a copy I would like to own it. Just email me at friendrm@nsuok.edu Q.B. Boydstun is like a friend of the family. I grew up in fort Gibson. The cover should be of a harcover blue color, that is how it is on all the copies I've seen."
4,So glad this film got picked up...,"I' love real independent films, not the stuff with big names churned out by studios and labeled ""indie"". I saw this film at the Brooklyn Film Festival 2 years ago and know that it's played at a bunch of fests over the past 2 years. Funny and clever and very independent - you just feel like you're watching something genuine. I'm definitely a fan."
2,Not what's listed,"This review is based entirerly on what's printed above. The tracks are great- the mixes are... a 'mixed' bag - some great, some horrid. My biggest gripe is THERE IS NO VIDEO ON THIS DISK!! I've written in over and over - even trying to find out if I had received the wrong disk.. but no. The really cool video of Flawless is NOT on this single - don't waste the money searching for it here."
3,Chris Carter is not Joss Whedon,"Average to below average TV fair. Granted I've only gone through Disc 1, but as much as he probably wants to be, Chris Carter doesn't have the ingenuity (he had to rip off the comic book story and pretend it was his) or the talent of Whedon. You can watch this on Fast Forward. But you'll do far better with Firefly or Dollhouse."
5,DB Fans unite!!,"I think I speak for many DB Sweeney fans when I say, THANK YOU for releasing this show to DVD.I thought this show had great promise, and an interesting premise, and I am disappointed that I will not get to see where it goes. I hope this DVD set might include some insights about where the story would've gone.Can't wait to see what's on this set, I know I'll be ready and waiting on August 24th."
4,Harsh Realm almost a 5 star,A dark gritty show with some well developed characters that had their virtual lives cut short by the show being cancelled. An innovative and interesting premise that never got fully developed. An interesting series with a ton of unrealized potential. I wouldn't buy it at retail price but you can find it fairly cheap by searching [...] or amazon.com.Enjoy an almost great series.
2,"""Complete"" - not really","Ok - I was a fan of the short-lived ""Harsh Realm"" - but I have to point out that the word ""complete"" in the title of the DVD set really means ""all the episodes that were made"" and not ""what would have been a complete season"".3 shows aired on TV and then either FX or Sci-Fi (can't remember) aired the remaining 6 episodes that were already made. However, after seeing the 9th episode, you are left hanging in the middle of a plot. And not like a season cliffhanger...it just drops because they had planned to make a few more episodes to round out the season. - So....while I recommend this for Harsh Realm fans...I can't recommend it for newcomers, as if you *are* grabbed by the plot, you are going to be horribly disappointed that you never get to finish the story and find out what happens."
3,Too disjointed,"Got bored about half way through and put it down. Too disjointed for my taste. We are traveling to Patagonia, and I was hoping to learn more about the country."
4,"great prose, signifying....what?","Patagonia is a sparsely inhabited arid area in the south of Argentina. Bruce Chatwin visited there for a year and wrote this book. It reads like a journal.The prose is descriptive, frugal, and unadorned. As a guide to writers, it's hard to do better. Yet, there isn't much of an overall story and no dramatic arc. It was tough for me to get through it."
2,Slow as a sloth,"When a book lacks tension and features extensive quoting, it's bound to be boring. This book is boring, and the main reason is that it lacks a narrative thread, other than ""been there, saw somebody, told me a long and winding story about somebody who was here some day"". All trips are inner trips, but in this case I would say Chatwin looked inside himself, found not a lot, and decided instead to cut and paste from old stories from down south."
3,In Pantagonia,"Not quite sure what I was expecting, but did not find this one particularly useful as a ""travel guide"" or particularly interesting as a work of literature. I seem to be in the same camp as the other three star reviewers as I did not find it of much value."
2,"Superficial, sometimes boring","I was very dissapointed when I first read this so famoues book, that many people interested in Patagonia use to read.The autor has a very superficial point of view of this territory and its people, there's no deep sight in the stories of the people themselves, who are seen merely as some kind of zoo animals, besides the only detailed descriptions the autor makes is about physical appearence (fat, slim, dark, no teeth, wrinkles, ugly, etc.), specially if they are men, what could tell us a lot about him.Some of the stories are quite absurd and show that he didn't understand a thing about Patagonia, sometimes centered in romantic stories of fugitives from the far west, yes, a part of the legend of patagonia, but...And finally, the sometimes racist comments on people, specially indians and chileans workers on the estancias (he always describe them as lazy and drunk!!!)"
5,Great Service,"Arrived promptly and in great condition. I don't know what to write to make this 20 words long. Am I reviewing the book or the folks who sent it to me? As for the book, it was a bit too clever for my tastes, it was more a reflection of the writer's imagination than the countryside."
2,Expected More Depth of Vision,"This is a book on a potentially engaging topic that came to me with high critical recommendation, but frankly didn't deliver. Chatwin's narrative is sentimental and seems in many cases superficial. His observations of the Welsh sheep ranchers seemed focused on insignificant details to the point that one may wonder if Chatwin had ever been diagnosed with autism. I couldn't finish the book."
1,Boring,"I found this a very dull book, at least the part I read. I stopped after about 30 pages. It's very describing: I see this, I'm there, I do that,..."
4,More interesting than informative.,"Depending on what you look for in a ""travel"" book you may or may not like this. If you're looking for history, natural history, or political developments, this is not the book for you. It is not comprehensive in any way.If you're looking for entertaining reading set in an interesting location with snippets of odd information this book would be entertaining. Of travel authors I have read, this author most closely resembles Theroux, but without the curmudgeonly judging. Like Theroux, his facts may or may not be correct but he doesn't claim to be writing a textbook, just some stuff that happened to him in this place.Mercifully, Chatwin spares us deep philosphical introspections so prevalent in much modern ""travel"" writing.I read it and enjoyed it and recommend it."
3,Mixed impressions,"Being Patagonia a huge extension of land, everyone expects that it's a vast and complex subject to write about. Reading this book made me feel that, in a certain moment, there'd be a shocking experience or kind of ""revelation"" for the author. But, as the chapters ran, I got somewhat frustrated and felt that, despiting his skills as a writer, Bruce didn't really try to deepen himself on the mysteries of the region, remaining in the surface of some sparses topics, like go in search of Butch Cassidy & Sundance Kid's steps there, sheep raisers, etc... Anyway, it still had a story good enough to encourage me to take my car and drive some 7.500 Km from home and know Patagonia. I expect to write a further review after completing this trip (mid-March)."
3,Human Fates,"A relative of mine recommended me this book because I was going to Patagonia. So I bought it to read during my trip.But it is not exactly a travel book. Well, it does describe a lot of weird details of the region's history, geography and zoology some of which might be kinda funny when you're travelling there.However, In Patagonia is more of a potpourri of human fates. Often it is pretty confusing to hold together the different characters and story-tellers and historical figures. So if you're not prepared for a not-too-easy read, refrain from this book."
3,Interesting but not one of the great travel writers,"As a young boy Chatwin is fascinated by a piece of skin of a long excint animal in the house of his grandmother. He decides to go searching for something like that in Patagonia. This book consists of about 100 very small chapters in which Chatwin combines the tale of his own adventure with the tales of travellers long before him. It reads like a collection of short stories what might be the reason I like this book less than the travelbooks of Thesiger, Theroux, Thubron or Murphy, to name a few."
3,"Good on people and history, nothing on natural wonders","Cute sketches on the interesting and rare types of people that would choose to live at the bottom of the world, far from the bothers of civilization. I was more interested in the natural wonders of Patagonia, of which this book says almost nothing."
3,Hmmm,"I have Debussy's two books in Preludes and it does make a difference to hear somebody else play. Whoever played these pieces for this album really made it sound so easy (at least to me) but I think Debussy intended for his audience to have mixed feelings about these pieces. I got to admit, it isn't for everyone."
5,GREAT product,I have severely dry skin. A few drops makes skin softer. Simple as that. I don't have to wear additional moisturizer. Lasts for several months.
4,Good buy,love it! i help my skin keeps hydrated and it doesn't iritate the skin... great and i like it. will buy it again.
2,The only product from dermalogica that caused allergy,"I am a big fan of Dermalogica products. But after using this booster, my face got covered with red and itchy spots."
5,Heavenly.,"At first I thought this was a bunch of BS!! A spa worker insisted that I get it due to the fact that my skin is on the dry side... I thought ""hydrating booster??? why not just use moisturizer??""Well, this stuff makes a HUGE difference!!! It smooths across my skin so nicely and it is not loaded with any artificial colors of fragrances like so many others.It's totally clear, scent-free and although it seems oily when you squeeze it out, you realize that it does not leave your skin oily at all when you rub it in. It just makes it smoooooth. I use my moisturizer over it most of the time, but sometimes, I just use this and it's awesome. It absorbs VERY quickly too!I love, love, love this and will continue to use it! Thankfully, I found it on here for less than half of the price! :)Fellow dry skin peeps should seriously give this a whirl."
3,Not exactly rocket science,"Merchandising math is all straight-forward algebra. This large format 340 page book is padded with a comprehensive description of merchandising, from fashion forecasting to merchandise hierarchies to vendor relations. The most useful information I found was how P&L is expanded for a typical retailer, and explanations of retail terms like maintained and cumulative margin. The exercises on planning P&L, preparing a six month plan and calculating OTB were useful, but the book is aimed at college students, anyone with retail work experience will find much of the material pretty obvious."
5,EXCELLENT,I received my order promptly and the book was in excellent condition complete with working CD!
4,Lovely facial moisture cream,"I have mild rosacea and am sensitive to a lot of facial products on the market. I enjoyed using the Elizabeth Arden Calming Cream because it is lightweight, absorbs easily into the skin and didn't irritate my already sensitive skin. The redness I see on my face hasn't gone away entirely, but at least this facial cream doesn't seem to be making it worse."
3,Thoughtful thriller,"Maybe ""tense drama"" is better than ""thriller"" for this one, but it has its fair share of taut moments. Brown owns a hotel in Haiti, where he hosts Mr. & Mrs. Smith as they seek to build a vegetarian center sponsored by the government. Together, they catch glimpses of the elusive Jones, who is consistent only in constantly changing what he appears to be.Greene successfully highlights the terror of the Duvalier regime in Haiti and the mythology that arose around it. He draws on characters that could be stereotypical (the idealistic Smith, the opportunistic Jones, and the realistic Brown) but manages to give them enough personality to feel real. As he does so, he explores what it means to be truly genuine, to care for a cause, and what ideals are worth fighting for (and how it makes sense to fight for them).This novel is thought-provoking, engaging, and provides an important glimpse of history."
5,Compelling In Every Respect,"From the characters with their bland names and complex personalities to the horrors of Papa Doc's Haiti, and a lot of intrigue in between, this is a compelling and wonderful novel. Greene reveals through his parade of characters the currents that ebb and flow through the personalities of lonely, rootless people who strive for more than just survival in a hell on earth: Greene's ""comedians."" Despite its title, this is not a lighthearted book filled with laughter. It's deadly serious, comedic only in what it reveals about human nature. Not having read most of Greene's body of work, I can't evaluate how this novel rates in comparison to other works by him. What I CAN say is that this is an outstanding novel that kept me riveted from start to finish."
4,Violent deaths are natural deaths here. He died of his environment.,"Just like ten years earlier in ""The Quiet American,"" Greene presented Vietnam in vivid detail to his readers. In ""The Comedians,"" he does the same with Haiti. Dictator ""Papa Doc"" is in power with American assistance because he's a bulwark against communism. Important characters include Brown the protagonist, Martha his German mistress, Jones the trickster who can't talk without lying and giggles to hide his inadequacy, Mr. and Mrs. Smith the innocent Americans traveling to Haiti to espouse benefits of Vegetarianism and Dr. Magiot, one of the few doctors in Haiti who is discreetly a communist. One finds the usual Greene elements in this novel: protagonist's cynicism about the life situation, love-hate relationship with his mistress, his frequenting the brothels and the discussion about morality, Catholicism and God. Reading Paul Theroux introduction is helpful too."
4,Flat but with an Involving Plot,"This is Brown, the narrator of ""The Comedians"", describing his outlook: ""I had left involvement behind me...I had dropped it... I had felt myself not merely incapable of love-many are incapable of that-but even of guilt. There were no heights and no abysses in my world-I saw myself on a great plain, walking and walking on the interminable flats."" In my judgment, Brown's outlook is a big shortcoming in this book. While ""The Comedians"" eventually centers on one of Greene's ironically heroic characters, there's not much juice (even with an affair) since the story is told by dull Brown. Bottom line: This is a good story with some personally and politically heroic characters. But this is not Greene's best work."
1,talk about buyers remorse...,"I'm a welder fabricator by trade, I was planning on building a stand for my 65"" Mitsu and should have stuck with my original plan.The Good:Color is perfectThe bad:Top shelf sags/bows with the weight of the TV on it.The other two shelves are not wide enough to put three components across. In other word if you want to put three componads on one shelf you have to stack two of them.Took over two weeks to get here from Amazon.Sits directly on the floor, it's missing feet.Did I mention that the top shelf bows.Because of the bow on the front of the top shelf the screen is now slightly angled downwards.I had to give it one star beacuse the was no zero or negitave."
1,Junk,"We too had problems with turning the sterilizer on. The unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed, but several presses got it to work a couple of times. After about 6 uses it died completely. Not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever (like an electric kettle) is exactly, but these guys found it.This unit also left a LOT of condensation in the stuff we sterilized."
2,Worked great at first...,"I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago. A week ago it just stopped working. I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore. So I went out and bought the exact same steamer. I used it for 2 days and then on the third day, yesterday, it wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm taking it back today and getting something else."
5,PERFECT - If you run it according to directions.,"I am seeing a lot of negative reviews for this item. You have to wait for the hot plate to cool before running again. This takes no longer than 20 minutes to cool. You can't just hit the button again while the plate is still very hot. That doesn't mean it doesn't work. I'm sure that's actually a safety feature. I have 2 children, 2 years apart, and I sterilized everything for months and months. I pumped so I had bottles and pump parts constantly going through this unit. Now that my kids are older, I still use it on a regular basis for sterilizing jars prior to canning. I even sterilize our toothbrushes regularly. I have used this unit on a constant basis for years. It's an excellent unit."
1,Zero stars!!! Avoid this product at all costs!!!!,"We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery. It worked the first time, but never again! I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working, it just would not turn on!!!!! I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period. I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply. Lousy product!"
1,Not so great,"I have this and have used it for about 5 months. I have never had problems with it starting, but it drives me crazy with the dripping all over the counter and the amount of condensation. I am looking for a new sterilizer because of this. I do not recommend."
3,Good Product for 7 months,"I used this sterilizer f0r 7 straight months 1-2 times everyday. Overall it was great..better than doing the boiling water method. However, there are two major faults I see to this product: 1) the metal plate accumulates scum or dirt so you have to wash the metal plate(which is attached to the entire product) or else the scum will keep accumulating where you dont want our bottle to be cleaned in anymore AND 2) after 7 months of using it, it finally SHUT DOWN on me and it would not turn on anymore. Im reading ALOT of reviews where this product just stops functioning."
4,Works Fine,"I have used this product for just over 6 months now and it works fine for the purpose of sterilizing baby bottles and accessories. The only complaint I have is that if you put in more than the recommended amount of water, you do get water leakage, and if you put in less than the recommended amount, you get the burn marks on the heating element. other than that it is a solid product. prefer it over the others that use the microwave."
2,not worth the $,"I have used this steamer daily for 5 months now. It leaks water all over the counter every time I use it. It does hold a good amount at once, although you have to wait for it to cool to run it twice in a row. The metal plate has become discolored. I wish I had done more research before I bought it - now I will probably have to replace it - it just makes too much of a mess."
4,It did its job,"We first got this as a gift and we had no problems with it. It fit our Dr Brown bottles and all the little pieces that bottles and pumps come with. We did end up having to get a second one because our first one broke but that was our own fault.Because I read the mix reviews here, I checked out all the other products. They either didn't fit enough bottles I wanted or were more than I was willing to pay. I decided to take a chance, hoping that my first one wasn't just a fluke.After being shipped, there was a big crack on the bottom of the white plastic container, however it looked like a foul up from the seller or shipping rather than the manufacture. Luckily, there was nothing wrong with the one from the old one. And it did a good job just like the last one.So would I recommend it? YesWould I buy it online? No"
4,Nice product,"Very nice steam sterilizer. I first purchased an Avent sterilizer. It was overpriced, difficult to de-scale, awkward for non Avent bottles and accessories. This works great for standard mouth bottles and accessories (including breast pump supplies), the container is easily seated and removed from heating plate, which is great for descaling and general clean up of attachaments."
4,Good but certainly not great ....,"but then I don't think Plant will ever do an album that matches the height of his work with Led Zeppelin. What we get here is a contemplative, sometimes brooding album, in which Plant covers a wide range of sources (including his own) to create a pleasing but not all together satisfying album. He is still drawing from folk forms, but there is a pop strain to the music. I even detected a distant echo of ""Indian Reservation"" on ""Let the Four Winds Blow."" The lyrics are strong, however, ranging from his disgruntlement with his peers on ""Tin Pan Valley"" to an apocalyptic vision of things to come on ""Another Time."" Probably my favorite song on the album is ""All the King's Horses,"" a beautiful ballad in which he contemplates the long road he has traveled."
4,Mighty Rearranger,"The lyrics are almost as deep as the wrinkles on Plant's face. His voice still resonates, but it sounds a bit tired and raspy. With Dreamland, Plant mellowed, seemingly as a conscious decision; with Mighty Rearranger, it's evident he just doesn't have the energy to perform like he did in his 70s, 80s, even 90s prime. I don't think he could do Fate of Nations, let alone Led Zep, convincingly anymore. I have a feeling this will be his final studio album. There aren't any songs on it that make me want to sing in celebration or dance on my own. Everything on it is just so-so. I don't really like the band much; the lyrics are too scattered and ponderous; but Plant's voice still shines through enough, even for nostaliga's sake, for a 4-star rating. It's sad that rock stars have to age, but legacies never die. Carry on my wayward one."
1,another disapointment from one of the greatest,"there is nothing about this cd i like. i found 90% of it to be boring and repetative. it all sounds the same. i have read other reviews that said how different it was from ""dreamland"", but to me, i can't tell them apart. i even listened to it all the way through 3 times. if you're having trouble sleeping i highly recomend it."
3,Album may be good but packaging sucks,"This album might be as good as the other reviews. I have not opened my copy. Why? Because I didn't know it came in a mini sleeve. And it's such a thin one that it would vanish in my cd cabinet. I have no problem with lp replicas, but give us the option. Offer these things in both the mini sleve, or digi pak and in jewel box. I still have jewel boxes from 1984. but all the digi paks I have from that early have deteriorated. I am checking in the UK and Canada for a jewel box version."
2,Thanks very little.,Was underwhelmed by the seller's use of full CD art and noting in small print below that it was disc only.Thanks very little.
5,Can't go wrong with this.,"This is a cd that I listen to over and over, especially in my truck. I played it for my boss and he immediately went out and bought it!"
1,A Whisper and a Prayer,"Like many other older singers, Robert Plant's voice is a lot lower than it used to be. But unlike Elton John, who writes new material to suit his deeper voice, Plant continues recording tunes he has to whisper to sing in key. Robert used his real voice in the Honeydrippers, why can't he now?This is particularly irritating in the light of Mr. Plant's repeated assertions that his music be forward looking. Since Manic Nirvana, Plant has been heavily re-exploring themes he developed with Jimmy Page in Zeppelin, and this CD is no different.That's what makes records like this so fustrating for long-time fans - make a record Jimmy Page could make solid contributions to, but force a basement style approach on Jimmy when you actually work with him (Clarksdale)! Thanks Robert!Somehow, I get the feeling that if Jimmy Page died tomorrow, Plant would start rewriting his role in Zeppelin in the same way McCartney has done with the Beatles: ""it was all about me."""
1,PLANT AT HIS WORST,"I am always leary about old rockers putting out new material. I have been a Robert Plant fan for years but this album really shows Plant's age. I really don't like the fact that he changes band members every couple of albums either. The 80's and 90's were Plant's best years. I really don't care for Plant's new style of music. I prefer the ""Principle of Moments"" and ""Now and Zen"" type of music. This music would be great if I was traveling through a jungle or visiting Africa. Not good, save your money. Purchase some of Plant's earlier projects if you want to hear some good music."
4,percy does it again,"It is amazing that at his age and what he has alreay accomplished in a decades old career that robert plant still is vital and making good, fresh music. His new album with his new band is just fine and his voice is fit as a fiddle. I saw him on letterman last nite and he looks great, tanned, trim and ready to rock.He understands his past and is willing to go on with his business and explore new terrain. I was very pleased the first time I heard the new album, it has been getting good reviews and I read a review or two of his recent shows and they were terrific. I applaud mr.plant for not resting on his laurels and his fans should be happy with his new album."
5,THE best Robert Plant solo effort,"THE best Robert Plant solo effort to date! Take a little Led Zep, throw in some world flavors, add a bunch of great musicians and you've got a hit. If the music biz was not in the state it is in today, this album would have been topping the charts. If you're a Led Zep fan, Plant fan or simply a newbie, I highly recommend you give this one a listen. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Please, people!","I've been a fan of Robert Plant for years, but I haven't followed his career as closely as some of you other reviewers out there. A friend of mine suggested that I check out this record and after years of appreciating Robert's songwriting and concept, I was pleasantly surprised that he turned in such an engaging effort. True artists grow and refine themselves. I believe that is the natural course for any discipline. If you are a fan, you will love this album. If you are an armchair critic, you will rate it low and say ignorant things about it."
3,Pioneering explained... Interesting reading...,"This book explains to the reader what ""pioneering"" means; and how it is done against all odds. Recommended for people interested in Geosciences & Steel making."
4,passionflower,I enjoyed this so much one never knows that to expect as how many Indian/bollywood movies start out. I keep coming back for more. I would suggest this is one to watch.
3,Kind of blah,Plot was a little stale. It had a lot of potential but fell flat. Priyanka Chopra was a star though. Her acting shines in this movie.
1,Farm Fresh Country Delight Canister Set,This product was a total disappointment. The inside collected moisture and molded the items in each cannister. I took out the rubber seal and it didn't help. I would not purchase this product again.
3,A very nice animation of the young Merlin vs. Vortigern,"This is not a great animation, but nice for kids to look at (ages 6-10). It is the well-known story of the Dinas Emrys legend, in which Vortigern the tyrant (very evil) flees to Wales and build a tower to resist his enemies in. Or at least, he tries, for it falls apart every night. Merlin, coming to terms with his special powers and the loneliness that comes with them, fulfills his role in the downfall of the tyrant by using his prophetic powers."
5,"Terrific book for any youth, high school, or beginning coach",Very comprehensive book. I learned something new EVERY chapter! It will be on my desk and passed along to my players for years to come.
3,Could have been better!,"The book is very good for young children but it needs something else.There doesn't seem to be a flow of information through the book the statements jump from one place to another and maybe, a little more information wouldn't be amiss(i.e.at one point there is a drawing of a small pony and the statement says'This kind of pony only grows to the size of a big dog' what would be wrong with putting down the name of the pony?)I was VERY disappointed by the drawings, photographs would have been better."
4,Easy overlooked original Alice Cooper Group recording,"If you are an Alice Cooper fan, do not overlook this album. You can hear where some of the later hits came from. It contains some very good music."
3,"Alice Cooper, but with training wheels","It is interesting that a lot of bands & Solo artists who have long & successful careers, don't normally start with their strongest work, The Beatles, Stones, Who, Queen & Beach Boys to name but a few.This is the same Alice Cooper, who's ""Easy Action"" I would class as an apprenticeship record. What I means is, that the bands still learning their trade when it comes the songwriting & musicianship.It is a decent record, but they haven't quite branded their own mark onto the album just yet.Saying all that, Alice Cooper has done far worst that this officering, so my advice would be to purchase the rest of his 1970's back catalogue first, then come back to this one."
3,"Hey, they spent money on production!!!","I'm no fan of Alice's debut ""Pretties For You"". It's too Zappa/60's psychadelic inspred ands also had songs that kind of meandered and weren't very cohesive. Oh, and the production is horrible. ""Easy Action"" is quite a bit better, the songwriting is better, the playing is better, the lyrics are better and thankfully, the production is better. It's by no means Alice's best work, but if you're going to pick up one of the two first albums, this is the one to get."
3,for alice completists and fans of the stooges type of rock,"To me the real alice cooper legacy begins in 1970 with 'love it to death'which is a true classic disc. The two that came before remind me alot of the protopunk stooges or something. This and pretties for you are an acquired taste unless you love those underground bands of that era. If you do then you will love this one. but if you are like me and love the hard rocking alice of 1970 through today then you will want to wait and get this one last unless it's in danger of going out of print. IT's just not the tight rock music that was to be unleashed on the world and change rock and roll forever, it's the spaced out protopunky pretrue alice cooper sound that is on play here."
5,A must read!,"Dworkin does a fantastic job of explaining how judges decide cases, and in turn shed's light on the subject of how law pertains to the people. He does this by explaining other theories about the law, and then addresses thier flaws in logic. Then, as he develops the concepts and premises that all theorists seem to agree on, offers his his own theory in contrast, and allows the reader a chance to search for any of his own deficiencies."
2,Badly delivered,"Friends from Amazon,A enjoy very much buying items with you guys. You have a long catalog, and deliver items quickly.It happened with all the recent items i've bought.But with the book Law's Empire, the person who has delivered it here in my building did not hand it to the doorman. The book was thrown through the gate and was found on the floor.I mean, the book is ok, it is not damaged, but it was a weird way to deliver.Thank you for your attention.Antonio Cabral from Brazil"
2,Missing meaning,"This retelling of the famous story of Swan Lake is a simplified version intended for younger children. Unfortunately, this simplification does a disservice to one of the main themes of this story. The ending is altered in a way that loses the idea of the prince being willing to sacrifice all, even his life, for his love. Even young children can recognize the princes's dilemma and appreciate what it means to sacrifice something important. This is a moral we would do well to leave in stories, not take out in the retelling. I also cannot leave without mentioning that although I have read many cudos for this author's watercolor illustrations, I have to say that I simply don't like them. Perhaps watercolor just isn't my medium."
3,ok but flawed film,"Teresa Wright plays a housewife who is hypnotized by a neigbor. He doesn't bother with the woman she is but the past life in her, Bridey Murphy who lived in 1800's Ireland. The beautiful Nancy Gates plays his wife who at times believes his interest in Bridey Murphy is more than a medical interest. The movie goes through the complete life of Bridey Murphy including how she reincarnates herself into the woman at the present day.The movie in the beginning tells us that the past lives you've had effect what will happen in your next ones, in other words karma. I kept waiting for the movie to show us this. Though there's a good ending I was disappointed with the movie's promise.More like 2.5"
5,Traffic Stopper Pigs,"We bought two of these pigs, one for each of the columns on either side of our driveway. The attention to detail is superb! I had looked for a flying pig statue for this specific purpose for quite some time before I found these. It's really humorous to watch the cars slow down as they go by our driveway! Some people have majestic lions beside their front doors, while others may have angels or gnomes. The flying pigs make a statement of their own, but I leave it up to you to figure it out ;)"
5,3 generations of kids,"I trust Herbs for Kids for many of my children's needs, specifically when they are small with developing immune and nervous systems. I have used it on now all 3 of my babies ranging from 16 months to 16 years and I have always been satisfied with the results. Great, safe product! Note: Do your research on how to use herbs properly and mixing with prescription drugs. Herbs are powerful and effective when used properly."
4,Gift Item,I ordered this item for a friend. Apparently his daughter really likes these drops and ever since she has taken the drops she gets sick less. These really work.
1,I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"First of all, I waited two weeks to receive these drops. Not only was the package poorly wrapped and packed.These drops only has a three months shelf life. I will never purchase again from this company."
2,one word: boring!,"I really like Kathryn Davis, so I am very disappointed that I have no desire to finish this book."
3,Requires a good working knowledge of Marie Antoinette before reading.....,"This stream-of-consciousness novel, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, simply didn't work for me. I suspect the reason for this is that my knowledge of Marie Antoinette and her lineage and the French royal family she married into is quite limited, so I simply didn't understand many of the author's references.Thanks to my numerous visits to Versailles throughout the years, however, I'm happy to report that the intricacies of the palace itself that Davis writes about made sense, although if you haven't ever been I can see how that would confuse the reader as well.I think that if I had more of a knowledge base, the references would have made sense and the novel may have been more enlightening. As it is, I muddled through it more confused than not. I suspect, though, it might be worthwhile to hang on to this book and re-read it after I've learned more about Marie Antoinette's life and the sequences of events."
1,Not my cup of tea,"Versailles by K. Davis represents a stream of Marie Antoinette's consciousness and very often I got lost. This fascinating character could not be captured in 200 disjointed pages...some prose, some dialogued in the format of a play and some babble. I found the book annoying and put it down forever after 144 pages."
2,ARGH!,"Her pug's name was MOPS!!!! and as the future Queen of France was stripped of all her ""Austrianess"" so too was Mops banished from French soil. There is so much right with this well-researched little book, but how does the author get such a well documented detail wrong? Eggplant? Where did that come from? Groan."
2,A Disappointment,"At times I enjoyed ""Versailles"". At other times I found it maddening. Some chapters are written in script format -including stage direction - I found this silly. At other times, we 're treated to Marie-Antoinette's inner dialogue - or inner babble, depending on one's take. Again, there were inspired sections but ultimately I felt she was trying too hard with the end result being inconsistent and just a little precious."
3,"more politics, less science and less characters",I really enjoyed Darwin's Radio but did not enjoy this one as much at all. Too many of the important events in the lives of the main characters occur offscreen. There are very few new scientific ideas. The interesting new characters we meet we see for only a scene or two with no closure.
3,Could have been happy with just Darwin's Radio,"This sequel tells the story of Kaye's daughter up to about 16 years of age. The new species of man Bear creates proves to be not all that different. There are new social interaction possibilities, and new english phrases, but they really aren't that much different. This makes it not that interesting. Additionally, the more group focus of the new species leaves the individual characters seeming disinterested or plain.If you liked Darwin's Radio - I would suggest you leave it at that, and use your imagination instead of reading this."
1,Too Far Fetched. The Prequel is better,"It seemed that this book was written because of the success of the first one. I liked Darwin's Radio much better as in the sequel, the author went way beyond fiction.If you read the first one, stick with it and don't buy this one so you can have a lasting better impression which might be affected by this book.."
3,"Page turner, but hard for me to believe","Darwin's Children is the follow-up to Bear's evolution/genetics novel Darwin's Radio. Of course it makes sense to want to explore what eventually happened to the new species that evolved in Darwin's Radio, but that of course leads Bear to attempt to write a political novel of how society reacts to real or perceived threats to human health or well-being. While the book was an interesting read and definitely a page turner, I just couldn't suspend disbelief over the concentration camps and flat out human evilness that was dreamed up by Bear as a result of these children. Overall, I would have liked more dramatic changes in the children and less dramatic changes in society."
1,One star is too generous,"I read this novel in the misguided hope that it would improve as it went on. It did not. I honestly can't think of a single thing that would make this book worth a read. The characters are like cartoon representations of people. The so-called plot is all over the place. My personal ""favorite"" is the scientist who thinks she's having a religious epiphany, and seeks to confirm this with a CAT scan. Between the pseudo-scientific pycho-babble and the deteriorating plot line, I'm amazed this book was even published. Unless you need paper to start a fire, try a different book."
2,"Ultimately, I put it down","Maybe I could have enjoyed this book more if I'd read ""Darwin's Radio"" beforehand. As it was, the characters were unsympathetic, the plot too meandering, and the pace too slow. I also have a personal aversion to gratuitously scatological stories, and found Bear's needless references needlessly jarring. About 200 pages into the book, I put it down and moved on."
2,"I finished it, but don't know why I bothered.","I usually like Greg Bear's work, but ""Darwin's Children"" was surprisingly dull. A lot of talk, not many new ideas (just rehash of the genetic stuff in ""Darwin's Radio""), uninvolving characters, and a strangely irrelevant Divine Intervention. Plowing through this book felt like a tedious homework assignment. It's a case of competent storytelling without much to say.I was also a little annoyed at an undertone stuck solidly in A.D. 2003: Bear takes swipes at Fox News, the Evil Republicans, American voters as sheep. Hey, I'm a Democrat, too, but I see enough of this political sniping in the real world. The best science fiction weaves social commentary into the plot and assumes the reader is intelligent enough to make their own comparisons to current events."
3,Only for Biology Geeks and Bear Fans,"I just finished reading this book. I was definitely surprised by the lack of plot and climax which are generally superb in Greg Bear's novels. It's as if Bear had so much more on his mind that he wanted to add to Darwin's Radio, but instead had to release it as a separate book. A more appropriate title might read, _Darwin's Radio 1.1_. However, I thoroughly enjoy the biology, making it a very pleasant and worthwhile read. If you love science, this book is a hardcover must for that reason alone. Otherwise, buy it on paperback later because everything Greg Bear writes deserves to be read."
2,The first novel from Bear I didn't finish,"Greg Bear was my favorite writer, period. If I saw a new novel from him, I'd buy it, no questions asked. But Darwin's radio falls short. His mutated children characters could be fascinating, but he doesn't spend enough time on them. On and on we go, about Washington, hearings, and recriminations. Hey, if I wanted to see that crap, I can turn on C-SPAN and watch the 9-11 hearings, I don't need to pay eight bucks. Where is the wonder and majesty of the Way, in the Eon series? The vast loneliness of space, and awesome sense duty in the Forge of God books? The strangeness and alien humanity in Queen of Angels? This book is a disappointment. If you want to go find the wonder that was Greg Bear, go get yourself an Alistair Reynolds book. That guy ROCKS! And Mr. Bear, please go back into the wonder business, so I can go back to buying your books again without worring about wasting my time."
3,"OK sequel, too technical on genetics theory","After reading Darwin's Radio, I quickly picked up the sequel. The story itself takes place about 10 years later, and has 3 main sequences. The first and last part of the book is entertaining, and definitely a page turner. The problem lies in the middle portion of the book. Bear goes into a detailed discussion concerning genetics theory and ethics, but for this reader - way too much detail. I found myself skimming quickly through a good 150 pages, waiting for the story to pick up the pace.Overall, it's good to find out what has happened to Mitch, Kate and their daughter Stella (who is now a teenager), but I was hoping for more..."
3,Watered down sequel to Radio's fame,"Having read nearly the entire Greg Bear sci-fi collection, I inevitably had to pick up Darwin's Children. I had heard and read reviews for it which didn't hold up to the fame of Darwin's Radio. After reading Darwin's Radio (wow!) I didn't see a need for a sequel. So, I finally read the book and it's true... it doesn't even hold a flame up to the greatness of Darwin's Radio. In general, it doesn't have so much emerging scientific discovery, hard genetic science or hair-raising implications. It comes off as a watered down sequel. It starts slow and remains slow for the first 80%. Such a huge chunk of book to build steam, but thankfully when the final 20% comes about, the plot twisted into just the right shape to provide logical action and a decent ending. So, comparing it to Darwin's Radio, it's actually a 2-star book, but reading it by itself for itself it may reach up to a 3-star book."
4,direction of evolution,"Most of the science of the previous novel is already established. This book focuses on civilization's response. Various government officials--through a combination of not understanding science and mindless careerism--manage to institutionalize all known new children. It is futile for them to do this, because the gist of the previous book is that eventually their own descendants will be the new type of humanity.As the novel progresses the children grow up and we learn just what this next evolutionary step is supposed to be. The new types are mostly psychologically different than humans. They cooperate differently, their fight or flight instincts seem to be wired differently, and they acquire language more readily. From an evolutionary standpoint this makes sense, as most of the pressures humans have faced for the last few thousand years have been from each other, whether through violence, economic competition, or trying to out-lawyer each other."
3,Super Reader,"The SHEVA children, with their super senses and different abilities and ways of relating are basically kept locked up in 'schools' apart from those whom their parents or others have helped stay free, doing what they can.People are afraid of the diseases they could be carriers for.Ultimately the resources of a few people aren't enough to stop the various authorities capturing the children and their parents, who are not exactly secret agents, in general. These post-humans/mutants must learn to get along in captivity, and do what they can to further their own ends, will frustrating those studying them as guinea pigs."
3,Good Story but a bit hard to read,The ideas presented in this book were wonderful and presented a very interesting premise. I enjoyed reading it! The only downside is that the author tended to get carried away with the genetics jargon. It might have been more readable if some of the specific details were presented in a sidebar or footnoted.
3,Darwin's Children,"It is not as good as the first book in the series, but I liked the book except the ending which was weak."
4,Good sequel to Darwin's Radio,"This was a good follow up to Darwin's radio. If you liked the first one, you'll like this book also."
3,Republicans?,"Not really a review, just a reaction to that idiot who raves about anti-republicanism. Wow, this is proof-positive of what we 'liberals' are talking about. And instead of taking the book to the dump, why not just burn it, as your soulmates in pre-WWII Germany did!!! The parallels between Bush and Hitler become more compelling every day!"
1,Audio CD abridged??? WHY???,"If I wanted an abridged version of this book, I'd wait for the Reader's Digest edition. What brain-dead editor decided to slice and dice this novel for the audio CD? No thanks... this is one audiobook fan who wouldn't touch this butchered rendition with a ten-foot strand of mutated DNA."
4,An enjoyable read,"This is a very short review but to the point, as the author ofThe Second Virgin Birth, I must say that, Darwin's Childrem, is well written with a well thought out plot line that holds you interest the entire book. I enjoyed reading it."
2,Let down,"Like several of his sequels, this book is a let down...it doesn't really have a clear plot or purpose. The first book was spent setting the stage for something 'big' to happen in this one, but it just fizzles and dies. Readers who like plot with their sci-fi will be disappointed."
4,Enjoyable read,"I liked Darwin's Radio, so I also enjoyed this book. For the people who said there were too many characters I have to ask: Did you read Darwin's Radio? Because almost all the characters in this book were developed in that one. Maybe before you read a sequel and then complain that you didn't understand all the characters, you should read the first one BEFORE reading the second one.Anyway, I liked it. Enough said."
5,Offers therapeutic revelations and insights,"Co-written by award-winning writer Shawn Regan and licensed clinical psychologist and family therapist Eleanor S. Fields, Brain Storms! is a true story of a patient's harrowing journey as he learns from the turbulent experiences of his past life. A work of non-fiction presented with the reading fluency of a novel, Brain Storms! offers therapeutic revelations and insights worthy of the best of the self-help book. Brain Storms! is a compelling and recommended journey taking the reader through phases of life, eras of time, and the depths of the human mind."
3,Rare and getting more and more deleted,"I bought this CD for just 1 track - it is part of a series of sessions recorded in 1944 by Timme Rosenkrantz in his apartment - he had a ""new"" recording device and Garner just sat and played solo, some versions have the accompaniment added via overdubbing in the 50's.The French Label 'Classic' which had re-issued this, seems to have stopped distribution - so there CD's are limited in supplyThis recording is not of the best quality and the piano is quite jangly, so probably a collector disc."
4,enjoyment plus,"Funny. I think the troops enjoyed the show. Thanks to all the comics that preform for the service people.Movie ""Patriot Act"" Shows the heart of why people entertain the service people all over the world."
5,diamond in the rough,"Bob Hope has nothing on this boy. Hope never directed a film let alone put together so truely a sensitive, sympathetic yet bitingly real picture of our men(and women) on the front, with all its day- to-day bloody horrors. From beneath these tough exteriors, Ross has magically peeled away the military toughness to expose the true fun loving great generous American character for us to embrace.Well done Mr Ross. Get a new larger camera and a bigger budget. We know we'll see your work on a giant sceen soon and can't wait!!"
3,A little rough around the edges and preachy,"I love Jeffrey Ross, but this movie isn't very good. It's very low budget and it shows. It's also waay too preachy about the war in Iraq and how awesome America is for invading another country. It was cool being able to see that part of the world being filmed by a normal guy though."
5,MUST HAVE!!!,"I purchased this cd after hearing Charlie Byrd play ""Cavatina"" on one of the Jazz For compilation cds. Am I glad that I did! The entire cd is wonderful, but it's worth buying if only for the performances of ""Ashokan Farewell"" and ""Cavatina"". SUPERB!!!"
2,This was not what a reviewer said it was...,"A reviewer wrote: ""This is a full color, large, poster-sized map of all 4 of the Apostle Paul's missionary journeys"". On the basis of this description I bought the item. Well upon receipt I found that it is not A map it is several maps and there is NO large poster-size map of all of the 4 journeys. Each journey is on a separate map and these maps were included in a set of other maps about Abraham and other stuff not related to Paul. And each map is rudimentary, without any detail except what might be needed for sunday school classes. Based upon the description quoted above I ordered the map as what might be helpful to me, a Paul scholar, not a sunday school teacher. This was a total waste of money for me. Buyer beware the description."
5,"Practical, well written, good reference","Other reviewers have already eloquently exprssed their opinions at length, so I want to briefly concur the book is a valuable tutorial and reference.What I like --1. Easy to read and grasp for a fairly dry technical subject. The anecdotes and ""war stories"" are very helpful. The sequence and flow is logical, making the book easier to use.2. Very practical and applicable.3. Excellent insights IMO from people who have ""been there, done that""."
2,Good entry level information,"The book gives a complete view of what software testing is about. But as an experienced software testing professional, I find this book boring. And the book is written with words connected together. I don't see the author's own voice. It is more suitable for a text book, rather than a 'book' book."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is fine for the price but, I should have spent more and gotten a nicer one. Others were right, the top falls in all of the time. And I don't even bother putting a tube of toothpaste in the middle - it's too small."
1,Frustrating & cheap,"I don't know why I didn't heed the reviews of the other reviewers... The top is completely annoying and barely functional; the toothpaste hole is NOT big enough for a regular toothpaste tube. I stuck mine in their and couldn't get it out no matter how hard I tugged. I had to remove the top and take it out from that side. Also, the top just doesn't stay on... click -clacks around every time I take my toothbrush out. For the price, I was not expecting such a poorly-made piece of junk. I will be returning this asap."
2,gray in color and the lid is loose,"I loved the bathroom cup from this series, but the toothbrush holder is a dull white/gray and the lid comes off too easily."
3,Not ready for sell,"Although this book has a lot of updates and IASB standard, it is not ready on market yet, at least one of promised feature--DEMO PROBLEM--is not on their companion website. The check figure is really a joke. So many answers are obvious, and each problem only has one figure. Although it is colored, it is not edited for visual easiness. The ink is very easy to smear."
1,UGH!,"I am taking online class for my business admin degree and was assigned this book for my Intermediate Accounting class. It is a horrible book, and is very vague. Maybe for an accounting major it would be ok or even good but for me it is awful. Also, I have only been using the book for a week and the binding is falling apart. Being an online class I don't have to lug it back and forth to school so I am not sure why the binding is failing."
2,"Rambling, confusing writing",This book does cover a wider range of arcane material than other accounting texts I have seen. But the main text is rambling and unclear. It often causes confusion in our class. Even the teacher has been stumped a few times by what the book means!
5,Exceptional and thorough.,"This is an exceptional and thorough review of the history of Moldova up to, during, and after the transition to independence from the Soviet Union by an outstanding scholar. While replete with scholarly notes and bibliography, it is also readily accessable to the non-specialist seeking to understand this very interesting country."
1,Great Film---Horrible picture and sound on dvd,"This was a great movie, it deserves a better release. The picture is horrible on this disc. but, if you still want to see it you can get it. I would wait until Anchor bay releases it, if ever. but it still has a great story of sci-fi fantasy throughout."
3,"Really 2 Stars but Like Someone Else Stated, a Good Alien Rip-Off.","Not Horribe; actually watchable on a night when you don't feel like going out and don't want to see a good sci fi movie, but something with some not too good effects so you can laugh. And what about Bryce (Diane Sallinger), it would have been good to see her character in a different movie."
3,it has its charm,"This 1985 SciFi/Horror film is poorly made. The acting isn't that great (Klaus Kinski is particularly bad), the writing and directing is only mediocre, as is the editing, the story at times makes little sense, and it is shot poorly. But there is something about it that makes you really enjoy the film. There is plenty of suspense, horror, action, violence, and some nudity. It is one of those films that Alien spawned. Not as good of a movie, but one I think you'll enjoy anyway. Quite frankly, this is one of those bad movies that I like regardless."
3,A half-way decent Alien clone,"Creature is a half-way decent Alien clone filmed on a small budget, decent models and with some space suits lifted from 2001. Released a year before Aliens, I caught this film on video and found it enjoyable. The plot centers on a rescue mission that is stranded on Titan after a landing mishap, they then search for survivors from previous expeditions and discover a really [upset] creature with a knack for using dead bodies as zombie slaves. The cast is largely forgettable save for Klaus Kinski and Diane Salinger who steals the show as a tough and very sexy looking security officer. The DVD is pretty basic with little if any features; it is not widescreen and has a mono track. Yet get what you pay for and I would not recommend paying more then [price] for this film. One of the better Alien clones, I like this one because Diane Salinger is so sexy in her black leather uniform and cool laser rifle."
2,Sent to me scratched up twice!,"Amazon sent this movie twice to me scratched up! First time, the container was broken on the way to my house. The disc got scratched up from sliding around in the case. Amazon sent me a free replacement, which was cool. However, even though the case didn't get broken on the way to my house, it still slipped out of its holding area, and got scratched up, again! Wow. Talk about piss poor quality. lol. Even more, the name, ""Creature,"" was misspelled both times on side of dvd. wow. Since i still like the movie though, I gave this 2 stars, because i wasn't about to risk getting another misspelled, and scratched, dvd."
4,spikedude,this bike is awsome its a realy cheap price if your son would like a bike this is a very light and durable bike.
5,This guy is phenomenal,"For pure virtuosity, I have heard few guitarists that can match this guy. If you love guitar music or bossa nova, definitely pick this one up. ""Manha de Carnaval"" and ""Passeio no Rio"" are breathtaking."
1,what a shame,I was realy waiting for this CD. Unfortunately the right cover contained the wrong CD: not Carlos Barbosa Lima Plays the Music Of Antonio Carlos Jobim but the Charlie Byrd Trio: The Bossa Nova Years. So a lot of money gone for nothing. I would never again order something from this guy!!!
5,perfect fit and application,"Exactly what I wanted. Color and quality excellent. Fit like I wanted, includes hook and loop fasteners on critical areas.Price is much lower than what I found at other sites and local stores."
1,Not Happy,"Not happy, ordered this pan twice one came broken the other cracked.Sent them both back I'm done with this one!"
4,Really big one!,"This is a really big, and very heavy skillet. It appears to be of good quality, but is quite different from the light, nonstick skillets many of us are accustomed to using. The sides are quite high, so will be excellent for frying chicken and clams or items that tend to splatter. The only thing I have cooked so far is rib steak and the results were exellent. Preheated the pan, sprayed with a little Pam. Steak was nice and brown on the outside and juicy, medium rare inside, the way we like it! I will also use this pan for cornbread and maybe upside down cake. Negative is that it is huge and hard to find a place to store. It currently lives in my oven."
2,Not so Great,"I read a lot of books on writing, and I felt that DIALOGUE: TECHNIQUES AND EXERCISES was definitely one of the weaker ones. This book imparts very little practical advice on how to write dialogue well. We instead get lots of pages devoted to irrelevant subjects (like a lengthy chapter on personality types) and a lot of other filler. If you're looking for a no-nonsense, get-to-the-point book on writing, this book isn't it.There's some useful information in this book, but most of it could have been summarized in less than 50 pages. My advice is to skip this overpriced book and spend your money on better, more comprehensive guides (such as Stein on Writing, Orson Scott Card's Character & Viewpoint, and Self-Editing for Fiction Writers).I felt like I wasted my money on this one."
3,dialogue moves the story along,"A relatively comprehensive guide to dialogue writing which highlights important aspects such as finding rhythm, identifying writing fears, and common mistakes. On the minus side, I found some of the advice to be rather obvious, while the chapter on mood is a litle thin and the one about dialogue quirks, over the top. Advice is ultimately aimed at mainstream writing, so if you fall outside of that you'll get less out of it."
4,A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF DIALOGUE,"DIALOGUE, by Gloria Kempton, is a comprehensive study of the dialogue mode of fiction-writing. It's filled with insightful looks at the potential uses of dialogue and practical tips on how to incorporate better dialogue into fiction. If there's a better book devoted to the subject of dialogue, I'm not aware of it.This is one of four in the Write Great Fiction series by Writer's Digest Books: Plot & Structure; Character, Emotion & Viewpoint; Description & Setting; and Dialogue. Each volume provides an in-depth, thought-provoking look at its subject matter. All four belong in a novelist's reference library."
1,Pseudo-scientific nonsense inside. Avoid!,"It starts out okay, with some good general advice on how to construct dialogue, although I often don't find the examples all that convincing. Things go downhill though once the author advises to use Enneagrams for figuring out the types of personality of the characters in a story.Enneagrams? Really??I don't think one should have to resort to pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo to create good stories, so I decided not to read any further. Before you know it she'll be telling us to sacrifice kittens before Cthulhu to fight writer's block."
2,Returned - Significant formatting errors,"I purchased and returned this. I really hate doing that and hate leaving a 2-star. The kindle version, however, has significant formatting errors, such as getting 10 words into paragraph X, then having the whole paragraph (Y) below paragraph X in the middle of paragraph X, followed by a repeat of paragraph Y (this was around location 2161 on my Fire). Considering how many other sentences made no sense at all, there were likely other less obvious instances of this formatting error. Writer's Digest, in selling advice to would-be writers, should check the quality of its product.As to the text that did make sense, I found the samples used to demonstrate strong dialogue as bad as those selected to demonstrate weak dialogue. E.g. one ""strong"" sample included an info dump. I couldn't believe some of the ""strong"" samples had been culled from the work of the literary elite."
2,Bradley Bay Sinks!,"The two stars are really just for the sheer weight of the thing. The characters are one dimensional, and the dialogue stilted. Every conversation seems to be a string of aphorisms and platitudes. These folks take themselves WAY too seriously!"
4,great crossover memoir on parenthood if you're openminded,i'm a heterosexual mom with a husband and 2 sons--and loved this book. it's really nice memoir-reading and a really nice story. green probably knows how lucky his kids are to be growing up with parents who care so exquisitely about the really important stuff in life. i think if you're a parent with even a halfway open mind this book will provide entertainment and insight.
1,Narcissistic even for a memoir.,"Jesse Green is the very definition of an unreliable narrator. Let's see: He hasn't adopted his lover's two sons; he doesn't live with them; and his lover named his brother in Detroit, not Green, as the boys' legal guardian if something should happen to him. Yet Green considers himself a father, enough to write a whole book about it. He is an accomplished prosesmith, but I can't imagine a snarkier, more narcissistic book. Read Daniel Mendelsohn's brilliant ""The Elusive Embrace"" instead."
5,An Engrossing Read,"I was given a copy of this book by my boyfriend. Actually, it was hidden inside of another gift he'd given me for my birthday. He'd spoken often of his desire to be a parent, and it wasn't s surprise when I received the book. The surprise came when I opened it up to find not just a story about two gay men becoming fathers, but actually a meditation on the many ways in which we become families, and how who we are is shaped by our parents, our families and by who THEY are. This very different journey into parenthood is also a journey into humanity, and those who have or don't have children, want or don't want children, will find something of their own story in this touchingly written memoir."
1,Scary implications,"I read this book on alternative parenting and quickly became horrified. It seems the author will justify anything he does under the guise of ""doing the right thing."" And he seems disturbingly pleased with his own ""integrity."" Frighteningly self-deluded is more like it. God have mercy on the child."
4,Lives up to title's promise,"Loved THE VELVETEEN RABBIT, so implied theme of this book appealed to me. By the time I realized the book was about gays, I was hooked into the beautiful writing and the moving history of a man becoming a father - Jesse and Andy's sons are lucky to have them as parents. I do not know them, so I cannot guarantee thier story is true, but it resonated with me and reflects my own experience as a ""normal"" parent. I believe in them. But then, I live in decency and with love, so I find no problem in seeing these also in other people, even if their lifestyles are different from mine. Why can't everyone see that? Can't they see beyond their own reflection in the mirror?"
2,Disappointed With Dualit Percolator,"Since Dualit makes a great toaster, I assumed their percolator would be good. I was wrong. There is an excess amount of coffee grinds in the coffee even with coarse ground coffee. In addition, the coffee continues to boil and after a while smells like it is burning. Very disappointing. The only nice thing is that it is cordless."
3,Disappointed,"I have purchased 4 Dualit Cordless Percolators in the past 4 years. First of all I must say that it is truly the very best coffee maker I have ever owned and it does make the HOTTEST coffee. However, all four of these have one major problem: WITHIN A 12 MONTH PERIOD, THE GLASS BALL ON THE TOP OF THE LID DIS-LARGES. I guess by continuously pulling the lid off after each use to clean the pot. Yes, it has happened every time with all four!!!! No one pot lasted beyond 12 months. There is a WEB SITE for parts (located in England) to replace the lid."
2,Dualit Percolator not so good,"We purchased this purcolator Christmas 2003, and ended up returning the first one after it did not work out of the box. Amazon was great in sending us out another via exchange. The second percolator worked. However, I wished I'd have saved my money. The coffee basket allowed too many coffee grounds to end up in the coffee. Don't take that last cup. You will also need a carafe to store the coffee in after percolating. The percolator maintains the heat too high when ready, and boils the coffee continuously. Mmmm, burnt coffee!!"
3,Dualit Cordless Coffee Percolator,"I really like the cordless feature of this product. Coffee perks in a reasonable amount of time and the coffee is very palable. The good features of this product is the reason I bought a second pot after about one year of use of the first one. I was disappointed in the short time it took the first pot to wear out. I had two main problems with it. One, it leaked water out of the bottom and two, the glass part on the top broke away from the main part of the lid. This was the only cordless percolator I could find or I would have brought another brand."
1,I don't understand why you are still selling this product,This percolator is not worth the price. The coffee tastes lousy and it does not stay hot.I returned mine and purchased the Farberware FCP512S 12-Cup Cordless Percolator. I love it!
5,awsome,"its awsome, a little akward in holding it, but overall, awsome, good power. two stage trigger. definitely get more clips."
4,Great choice,Well it was fine and dandy when I received it came 1 day before estaminet opened it up when out and shot it sites dead accurate well I came in my house dropped it on carpit the hammer and rear site snapped of so now I shoot without I'm planing to supper glue it back but it still shoots fine best with crosman destroyer pellets 177 caliberI recommend this gun for first time pistol shooters great for large hands not heavy no kick at all
5,great co2 gun,conservative co2 use in my opinion. can hit a dime from 10 or 15 feet on a co2 cartridge that has seen 30 shots or more. not to sure about the maximum amount of pellet shot from one co2 but online says about 70 with an amount of decent power. and a decent price point.
4,"Crosman 6"" 357 Colt Python CO2 Revolver","This is a great gun to shoot, after siting it in took 15-20 min. and ten shots just to be sure of accuracy. It seems to stay sited in after 150-170 shots, and it feels good in my hand. The first ten shots are loud sounds cool the next ten are still fairly loud too.It sure rips a hole in a pop can (wadcutters) and a soup can from about 35-40ft. I shoot this gun almost every day. I'm considering buying a second one I like it so much.Amazon.com great prices and products I love shopping here."
1,Broke after second use,"I picked this rating because although it worked great the first time i used it the second time i went to turn the nob (which breaks the valve on the C02 cartridge), it bent out of place, so now i cannot put the grip back on the gun. I spent some good money not only on the gun itself but on extra pellets and C02 cartridges, so its more than just a loss on that aspect, i would not recommend this pellet gun to anyone."
2,gun,I bought this for my son he said it was bigger than he thought but enjoyed his new gun. It is a heavy pellet pistol.
4,Pretty good,Great product accept after the first 200 or so shots the co2 only shoots about 30-40 shots per canister . Other then that It is a great Gun . Feels real and shoots fairly well.
4,"No accuracy, but a fun repeater","This is a very inexpensively CO2 repeater. The quality is surprisingly fine for such a cheap product. Accessories like theCrosman 0407T Rotary Clips, Fits 357 Pistols, 3pkare also easy on the wallet and functional all the same.The weight and looks are good. The sight is rudimentary, however, and the CO2 pressure varies greatly over the few clips it can power. There is therefore no accuracy to talk about with this pistol. It is a fun second gun."
2,not so good,I was slightly disappointed with this product I got this thinking it would be better than what it was this gun cant shoot though a soda can for starters I also put it in a vise to make It hold still to see if it was constant but it was not it is kind of fun but honestly I could shoot at my friends with this and still feel like there safe2-5 for this product.
4,good gun,this gun is very accurate its power is good for most co2 pistols and is fun to shoot the single and double action is makes it even better. The only thing i do not like is that the co2 runs out fast it may not seem like a big deal but buying alot of co2 cartridges can be expensive.
3,False Advertisement,"works great.. just next time you show pictures of whatever your selling, try making shure u take pictures of exactly what your selling.. not all this extra bs i was looking forward to coming with it -__-"
2,ok,fast shipping item was missing some parts but everything else was ok. tried to contact the seller but never replied. I had to buy parts from some other ppl
2,Product Description...Omits a critical detail,"I ordered this item based mostly upon the positive reviews... look, this Pellet Revolver really may be the ""bee knees"", but... I wouldn't know cuz... IT DOESN'T COME WITH CO2 CARTRIDGES!!! No where in the Product Decsription does this get mentioned... I wanted to use this thing right away and for some reason it takes ANOTHER WHOLE WEEK to get the CO2's delivered via Amazon... C'mon Crosman, get your act together and ensure people know what they're buying! Ya, I'm STILL waiting on the #@&% CO2's to be delivered, so... I'm not a happy camper... (BTW... i purchased the ammo at WalMart, but that also does NOT come with the gun...)"
2,GOOD PISTOL BUT GETS BORING,I GOT THIS GUN BECUSE IT LOOKED COOL AND IT WAS A SEMI AUTO PISTOL.I USED IT FOR ABOUT 1 MONTH AND HALF AND GOT BORED OF IT. HOWEVER IT SILL WORKS FINE.
3,"Great feel and design, not much power","Bought this and expected a bit too much power out of it. It works great and has a really good feel to it. I haven't had any problems with it yet. What disappointed me about this gun was the power it delivered. I shot a glass beer bottle from about 12 feet away and the pellet bounced off. I surely thought it would break the bottle, but it didn't have enough juice or it might have been where the pellet hit. well nonetheless I would've expected a broken bottle and instead I had a pellet bounce back. I would greatly recommend to use eye protection! Sometimes the pellets wont pierce the target and it will then bounce back possibly hitting your eyes or someone's around you. Please be careful with that. Other than the lack of power which is understandable due to the CO2 powered mechanism. Everything else functioned great. I was able to shot and kill some birds but you have to be really close to have a one shot kill. I don't recommend this gun for much hunting."
4,good gun,very well made construction and can be shot easily because of the two types of mechanismes. 1st you can just pull the trigger. or 2nd pull back the tab and then fire. the only con about this bb gun is that it uses up a lot of co2 on one shot and it only takes about 2 minutes to use up one cartridge.
5,"So far, So good.","Great looking and functioning air-pistol. Built solid and nice price from Amazon. I'm satisfied... If you need this kind of air-gun, get this one - it's a nice one..."
5,Exceptionally pleased,"I bought this gun as my second air pistol. Much more accurate than my previous air pistol. I have yet to sight it in but I've noticed an overall tightness of my groups, about 3in. Not the best air pistol I've ever fired but definitely worth the money spent. ($40) My only problem is that Amazon does not seem to carry extra clips, but with that aside, excellent purchase."
4,a fun gun,"Hi!! the 357 mag co2 is a fun gun took it to a friends house to shoot in his back yard, set up some cans about 30ft away 7 out of 10 shots hit the can the sights were pretty good power great too!and for 39.95 dont think you can beat it for a young son and his father would be great fun but not without a adult around also bought one for my aunt she loves it thank you."
5,Great value!,"The 357 Crossman is a great value. It's really pretty accurate and easy to use. I feel the rifled, six-inch barrel makes a big difference. The pistol grip is a little large for smaller hands. I'm an adult male, so not problem."
2,C02 Gas Leaks,The Gun is nice and feels nice but the Gas leaks on this!! I can only fire like 30-50 bbs/pellets!! and the aim is terrible!Thanks God I can return it...
2,Two of these is my limit - no more,"I've purchased two of these guns over the past 2-3 years, for the sole purpose of scaring away roaming dogs. I can count on two hands the number of times I used each gun. With the first one, the barrel latch wore down to the point that the barrel wouldn't stay up. That was after 20 or less reloads of cartridges. I bought another one as replacement in February 2011, and have been extra careful to avoid wear on the barrel latch. Now the problem is leaking CO2. Once a new cartridge is put in, it's empty in several hours just laying on a table. I'd say I've used this gun maybe 7-8 times in a year and a half; fewer times than the first pellet gun. I've never dropped it or abused it in any way; it stays in a drawer when not in use.Having such issues with such little use, tells me these are cheaply made. I won't be buying another Crosman."
3,The Crosman 357,"I bought two of these guns and ended up returning both of them. When I went to shoot it, it would shoot the first shot but then the co2 would die and you would have to wait like 20 seconds for the power to come back. The power on this pistol is not that great, most of the time it would not even shoot though a tin can, which I thought was weird since I saw this gun shoot though tin cans on video's and glass bottles. I dont know if somthing was damaged internaly or what but It would not keep any kind of power after the first or second shot."
1,Defective and poor service,"Did not work. Called customer service ( crosman) 15 minutes after delivery, they said product from Amazon was probably old and defective. They said to throw the gun into the trash and they would send a new one ; that was Oct. 3 still waiting!"
1,horrible gun,Do not buy this gun. Waste of money. The screw that you in with the co2 cartrige in with broke off. Dont buy it just because it looks cool.
4,just got it and love it,this is a great gun for the price. i just got it today and so far love it. my co2 seemed to run out a bit fast but its not a great co2 cartridge brand so its proablly the co2 companys fault. i love this gun so far its a bit of a pain to reload because you have to do it so frequent so i would suggest extra clips. mine seemed to have some wear on it so im wondering if it was possibly refurbished or something of the sort but i havent had any real problems with it yet so thats good ill proablly do another review after more use thanks :)
5,Love it,"A fun pistol. Pretty powerful. The plastic pellet holder I am not a fan of, but it does the job."
4,Crosman 357w revolver,"Overall I think its a really great product. It looks really cool, it si very comfortable to grab and shoot. It shoots smothly and with power, and for a very nice price. I would recommend this product to beginners and pros alike."
4,fun cheap shooting,"Listen stupid, the president isn't gonna take away your precious handguns, but you don't need them anyway. this works great for target shooting"
4,It's a gas!,"Very nice for the money! You can spend a lot more and get a lot less in return. It has a good feel, adjustable sights, is a lot of fun to shoot, and is reasonably accurate. If it's plinking fun you want, this pistol is a relatively inexpensive way to get it. The only negative I can come up with, is that it takes too many steps, for my liking, to change the gas cartridge, but that's a small negative compared to all of the positives. I recommend this little beauty. Oh, and buy some extra pellet cartridges right away. Be safe, it IS a weapon not a toy!"
5,favorite gift!,"I got this air gun for my boyfriend for Christmas and he hasn't stopped playing with it yet. I love the 10 round clips. Our other airgun loads one pellet at a time (it slows down the fun). I also bought extra clips so we can load them all and go! It is pretty accurate too! In short, I would say it was my boyfriend's favorite Christmas present!"
5,Best price I found was on Amazon,I tried all the websites to get it the cheapest I could. It's a mass produced bb gun so it's the same at all stores. Cheapest was here and the accessories are cheapest at walmart. Great and powerful for cans and teaching young ones to handle a gun.
4,357,this gun is amazing i shot metal bb's at a little ceasers pizza box went right trew it.if your looking for a big gun thn u should buy this crosman 357 the mag hold 10 bb's/pellets
4,Decent. Solid review,Everything except the center of the gun is plastic. As with many other reviews the gun came without the sights being dialed in but after a co2 cartridge they were perfect. VERY accurate for $45 and decently loud. The gun feels a little large but still workable. I would recommend dabbing the top sights with some nail polish or something to help increase their visibility. Over all it seems to be a great gun. Im getting about 65 shots per co2
4,Great book!!!,"This book was really a big help for me. I am developer, but unfortunately I haven't had many projects in .Net framework. I once applied for .Net position, and I read this book to prepared for my interview. The interview went well, and the company proposed me a position two months later after they finished with their interview process, but unfortunately I couldn't take it because I had taken another position. Easy to read and understand. Like I said I am a developer, and I know my field."
2,Not for the Novice,This book is not for the novice. It does not contain enough clear and complete examples for a novice to use. Database examples are also weak. The arthur only talks about SQL server. What about other connections strings and syntax? I found Google to be a better guide to the programming I had to do.
2,Buy a cheap used asp.net 2000 book instead.,There is a reason why this book was published so early. There is not enough detail on the new features associated with 2005.
1,Stay away!,"For the love of God, who green-lighted this misbegotten project? The ""re-mixes"" render the original songs virtually unrecognizable. Typically, one or two measures of the originals are sampled and then looped repeatedly over a lifeless ""thump thump thump.""At their best, Odyssey arguably represented the finest music of the disco era, surpassed only by Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band.But this project is a pointless waste of time and money. Go for the ""Native New Yorker"" compilation instead."
4,WWII History Magazine,"This magazine is a great compliment to any historian's study of WWII. The articles are fresh and well written, and the topics covered are well researched. The format is very pleasing to the eye. You are not blasted with advertisments on evey other page. Some of the topics written about I've not seen in a number of years. If the editors keep it up, they will be around for a long time. If you are a serious historian or even a casual reader of WWII, you will enjoy this magazine."
4,Keep it Alive,"World War Two must never be forgotten. The most significant event of the twentieth century changed world politics forever. WW2 History takes us inside the big stories as well as bringing us the smaller, though no less important, stories of the war as it actually happened. If you study WW2, you need this magazine."
1,Do not deal with this company,Can't really say anything about the magazine since I haven't received it yet. It took Amazon and this company a matter of minutes to process this payment but here I am 7 months later with NO MAGAZINE and no answers as to what is being done other than a form letter saying we'll get back to you. Avoid this company unless you like being treated like a nuisance instead of a customer.
3,"A great resource for scholars, but of limited value to other","This book compiles both black and white and color photographs of ancient Athinian vase paintings, complete with artistic and cultural analysis. It is very technical, geared towards the scholar of antiquity or art history. Those extrodinarily interested in the subject who are not scholars may get some value out of it, however."
3,Good for the Beginner,"Although the reviewer above knows far more than I about opera, I think this was an excellent book for getting the feel of the history of tenors. I acknowledge that there are errors, but as a basic starter book, I enjoyed it very much. As a devoted Jose Carreras fan, I was amused that the author quoted him as saying one of his dreams was to sing the title role of Manon Lescaut (a 15 year old soprano). Almost anyone would love to see that (especially the costumes! )."
2,THE GREAT TENORS FALL SHORT.,"It takes courage and little responsibility to provide and develop a ranking of past and present great tenors into a book of world-wide appeal without a thorough search, knowledge and listening experience. I doubt whether Helena ever heard or listened to recordings of Giacomo Lauri-Volpi (1894-1979) otherwise she would have included him among the greats. Giacomo is tops, perhaps even greater than Enrico. I am saying perhaps because it would be unfair to compare Caruso's archival records even boosted by digital refinements with Lauri-Volpi's fine and well preserved operatic highlight records (currently available on CDs) of the early forties. Lauri-Volpi's voice intelligently combined the sensuous beauty of the young Carreras' legato singing with Pavarotti, Domingo or Melchior's resounding high C's."
4,Good juicing book.,"This book is not too bad figure in it came out in 1989 and much of the info is still up to date. In this book though it gives you the problem and then which vegetables are good for this problem for example:Blood pressure: beet,beet green,cabbage sprout,cucumber,spinach,wheatgrass. Get the picture. It also has a section on fasting,designing a juice program and buying a juicer. It also got some recipes it does not tell you what there for. Like Juiceman Jay's book will tell you if your fatigued try such and such a juice. In this book you got to figure it out yourself. But like I said for coming out in 1989 its gotta a lot of info."
4,Juicing book,"I'm still reading this book, but it has some very useful information regarding fruits and veggies, to help you in blending or juicing foods to drink. A good and helpful read so far..."
2,The Juicing Book- a disappointment,"I was pretty disappointed. I know mostly all of the data( benefits, etc.) about juicing, but was looking for more creative recipes. There were only a few at the end of the book."
2,not your average juicing book,"Well, I bought this book hoping to find juicing recipes in it. I was disappointed in this regard. I does have good information on going of a juice diet for health reasons. It's good for those that have absolutely no understanding or knowledge about juicing, that's not me. I was looking for juice recipes and that was not really given to a great degree. So if you're new to juicing for your health, buy this book, it will be valuable; if you're an experienced juicer, look for something else to spend your money on; this isn't the book for you."
3,Very old book...,"I enjoyed reading the book, but I didn't realize how old this is. It wasn't a huge deal, but I am sure that new information and discoveries have been made about the power of juicing since the 90s, so I was a bit disappointed that the book was so dated. I should have realized the age of the book before I purchased it."
2,Boring,"The book is like one of those books you receive from a club, a second, or whatever you want to call it. A few good recipes but mostly a lot of stuff that I don't even care about. I thought it would be a juicing book chock full of recipes, but it's not. Disappointed."
1,Disappointed.,"I purchased a new juicer from Amazon and this book was a suggested add-on. I needed recipes and Amazon usually offers reliable products. So I fell for the come-on and orderd this book. It turned out to be cheaply published and poorly written pseudoscience about foods and health and offered only a few recipes, none of which was worth looking at."
2,Poor fit,"I'm returning these to Amazon, both for the poor fit and poor design:1. The size runs large2. The short part behind the heel is not sufficient to hold the slipper on the foot and is just annoying.3. The material inside the slipper makes it very slippery and the slipper ""walks"" off the foot.On the plus side: It's a nice looking slipper."
2,comfortable but leaves scuff marks on floors,"These are super comfortable, however the firm sole leaves scuff marks all over vinyl, tile, and hardwoods (I bought them in black). My husband swears that the carpets look dirty too. Needless to say, they are going back to the store. Too bad, because they are very comfortable."
4,Totally Squishy,"These slippers are really comfortable, true to size, very warm, nice to wear out to pick up the paper and they just look nice. I want another pair when they have my size available. Great for winter, may be a little warm for summer so they get 4 big stars!!"
3,These run small.,"These are nice slippers but run small. I didn't want to be bothered with the hassle of exchanging them, so I gave the two pairs I ordered to my son (12) and daughter (9) who are happy with them, even though they are slightly big on my daughter at present but she will quickly grow into them. Only three stars because of the sizing problem."
3,Really 3.5 Stars. Not up to other books by Fantasy Flight.,"There happens to be a great deal of very cool and useful information in this book. So if I had gotten it before ""Path of Magic"" and ""Spells and Spellcraft"" it would have rated a ""4"" for sure. (Those two books by the same publisher are just that much better.) But now on to the good parts. There are many very cool feats, prestige class's, and legandary class's. In addition to those are the combat styles, which I thought were very cool. To use them take the existing skills and combine them in a particular way to achieve those special actions that are usually only read about or seen in movies. So if you are looking for some flare for your warrior types, in your campaign, this book is for you."
2,You get what you pay for,"This dumbbell is available at Dicks for more money but is of much better quality. I would not reccommend! Do not trust the collars, unsafe"
4,Beautiful Illustrations and a fun read,"My Son is 19 months old. The book is a bit wordy for him, so I have to read a bit quicker...but he enjoys it. He recognizes the characters, and points out all the objects. I'm sure in a few more months, he will ask to read it over and over again."
4,good for big plates,"It works good with big plates, because the weight of the plates will hold this rack in place. If you plan to put medium size plates on this thing, it will move around when you try to take out the plates. Unless you use something to fasten the rack."
2,The quality is just so-so.,"It's not painted as you may think. The color doesn't look as nice in the picture. The corners are not sanded and some ends are chipped from cutting the wood. Overall, the quality is just so-so.On the other hands, the dimensions are as specified and it works."
2,Not as easy as it seems.,Bought this item for my 82 year old mother who loves crosswords puzzles but she found the print too small and the crosswords abit difficult.
4,Gotta Love Organic Dog Food from Wellness!,"I remember when it was almost impossible to find oragnic dog treats online. Amazon rocks when it comes to buying organic dog treats! I ususally get my treats from doggiemunchies.com because of the quantities and flavors they offer, however I decided to try the 30 pound bag of organic dog food to offer both organic treats from doggiemunchies.com and the food from Wellness. Now my dogs get the best from both worlds!"
1,My Dog Wouldn't Touch this with a Ten Foot Pole!,"My dog seems to be allergic to poultry so we thought we would switch him to this lamb-based formula. Usually he is a good eater, but my dog had one smell of this stuff and wouldn't come back. I understand Wellness puts higher-end ingredients in their food but if a dog doesn't like it there goes your money right down the drain."
5,Great!,"We have a black female lab. And since she was little she would not eat anything but pedigree and as long as shd was fine we gave it to her. For the past 3 months she was licking her paws, itching, she had bald spots. I treated her with different kind of oitments which brought her coat back at thr bald spots however she was still licking and itching, shaking. We finally decided to change her food from that horrible by products pedigree to wellness and two days later less itching licking and everything. Although it is pricey i dont care she is herself again!"
5,Great Dog Food- Great Price,"Wow. Who would have ever thought that ordering 30# of dog food on line would be such an EASY transaction? I ordered this on Monday and it arrived on Friday via FedEx. Not only was this an easy transaction, it was cheaper than buying it in the local store. Our Sadie loves this food and I feed good knowing that we're giving her a diet of something that's good for her..I'll be ordering again in 8 weeks!"
5,love wellness,"When we were waiting for our Mini-dashund to be old enough to come home I did a lot of research on foods and things for him. The breeder had him on a food called Life Abundance- which though better than grocery, I wasnt impressed. That and the fact it's 20 bucks plus shipping for an 8 lb bag and it shipped. I call it the Avon of dog food. Good stuff but I can find it cheaper at the store. I went with Welnees small breed puppy, its ingredient list is really good. At first Fenways stools where soft but as we went through our first bag and transitioned completely into the new food, it was the breeder food casuing the diarhea. I will keep him on Wellness despite the price, though I am going to try the regular Just for Puppy. According to the bag's ingredience the only real different is the size of the kibble and I read reviews that someone was feeding it to a morkie so I imagine its not going to be an issue for my 4.2 lb pup."
5,"Seriously though, dogs will eat their own poop.",My wife and I have been feeding the wellness Super5Mix lamb mix to both of our dogs since we took them off of the puppy mix. We have a golden doodle and a schnoodle. I must say they aren't charging for the bowl when we give them their daily amount but they do end up eating it all by the end of the day. I have no complaints. I have friends with dogs that eat junkier food and the dogs end up eating more of it and pooping more as a result.
5,Great Dog Food,My dogs love this food. It's also a much healthier product for them than some other cheaper brand names. They eat it up.
5,never enough,"My 7 year old Catahoula has been eating Wellness Super 5 Mix for 2 - 3 years and is thriving on it. Her coat is beautiful and her stomach ""activity"" is nice and normal. She gets 3/4 cup twice a day and a few treats during the day and she appears to be a happy camper. She cleans her bowl at each meal and would probably eat many, many cups of this dry food ---if I offered it!"
1,Developed problems after couple weeks,"I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken). I have to say, I am really disappointed with this dog food. Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies). I noticed the chicken formula is back on the market and I will for sure be switching."
4,Good stuff,"The dog likes it, but he can't write so I have leave this review for him. He especially likes a spoonful of quality canned dog food warmed up and mixed into his bowl of Wellness."
3,Not agreeing with the dog,"The ingredients look good and I'm sure that this is a healthy formula. But after a week, my dog's stomach is still not tolerating it well. I've been doing a 50/50 mix with her previous food to transistion. I'm hoping that she'll grow into it because this looks like a good formula,"
5,No more gas,"Boxers are known for being susceptible to gas. My Boomer is aptly named, but since switching to Wellness dry with about a third of a can of Wellness canned food, fed once a day, he stays slim, energetic and blessedly flatulance-free. I also note, over a few months, that skin bumps are disappearing. I've tried several top brands, and this seems the most healthful."
4,Finally found a food that works for my dog,"Jaz has food allergies that cause him to have diarrhea and gas. The Wellness Super5Mix dry dog food, chicken recipe, is the best food that I have found to control his symptoms. He eats it twice a day, with some canned food, also. No diarrhea, no gas, and his coat is super shiny!"
3,Not For Us,"My puppy is 10 months old. Tried 3 times to ease her into this food, but she kept getting sick and throwing up. This is only with a table spoon added into her Science Diet food. Got to where she would not eat her food at all when we had the Wellness mixed in. We put her back on her Science Diet Puppy food and she is fine. Unfortunately this one did not work for us.I will add we have a 9 year old dog that we did the same thing with. She was fine, and loves the food!"
3,Not really for my Doberman,"I did the wrong thing at first and did not transition him effectively from his previous dog food. Now I know why it is clearly written on the packaging. My 105 lb Dobe had the loudest farts (which created a lot of entertainment until you had to leave the room), explosive gas and the runs. He still has bad gas from this food and it has been 3 months. I don't think his system works well with this. He seems constantly hungry too. I will be transitioning him to something different by the end of the month.I originally purchased this due to a recommendation from a friend. I guess it works great with her German Shepherd and Pittbull. She claimed that it made their coats shiny, their mood was better, and they seemed satisfied instead of constantly hungry.Too bad it had the opposite effect in our household."
1,Chi won't eat it,"Very disappointed my chi wont eat this. Not sur I can return this open product. Boy, it s expensive to figure out what your pet will be happy to eat !"
1,Not for my dog,"I purchased this, thinking it to be a good product.However, within 3 days, my dog was itching and pulling her hair out.Took her off the food and her hair is coming back.Went to another brand immediately."
5,Great for dogs,"It's a very healthy dog food and my dogs thrive on it. Not only is it healthy, but they love the taste. I actually use the pieces as treats and give them a healthy weight for their regular food. Can't go wrong with Wellness."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,MY DOG HAS VERY SERIOUS STOMACH PROBLEMS AND THIS IS THE ONLY DRY FOOD HE CAN ACTUALLY EAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT A DOUBT!!
3,An ok read.....,"An ok read....., December 29, 2008By K. Provencher ""Kate"" (NJ) - See all my reviewsI am currently reading the entire Maggie O'Dell series and was disappointed by this installment. The pacing wasn't as nice and the story itself was beyond unbelievable with some of the ""coincidences"" that occurred. This book is one I feel that I could skip in the series without missing much in the way of character development. The story was okay which is why I still gave the book 3 stars; however, it is really a weak link in the series."
3,Agree with Most Reviews- A Letdown,"I agree with most of the other reviewers that this was a bit of a letdown after the first two books. Much more predictable and less suspenseful. The romance between Nick and Maggie is untouched in the novel, and I was really looking forward to it unraveling more. I haven't read the fourth book yet, but hopefully it is more like the first two."
2,Still searching for the plot....,"One good thing I can say about this book is that I did not buy it in Hardcover!! Compared to the authors other two attempts, this book was jumbled and really never decided on a direction. It also left the FBI characters looking like the keystone cops. I think every reader knew by about page 100 who the killer was and, more importantly, what a tripod looks like even when it's folded. One gets the impression that the author felt the need to""dumb up"" her characters for some reason? or maybe she felt her ""target"" readers had dropped a few IQ points for this book. Either way, I found myself skimming through the book and moving right past the predictable parts (which pretty much left page one and the last page). Hopefully Ms. Kava will put a little more effort into her next book and we can again see some of the brilliance exhibited in both A Perfect Evil and Split Second."
3,Maggie is a basket case!!,"I have overall enjoyed this series of books, however I'm getting tired of what an emotional basket case Maggie is. I can't believe she is still an FBI agent and not in daily counseling. She doesn't seem to be able to get through any part of her day without some incident triggering a memory that makes her nauseous, break out into a cold sweat, take her gun on a jog, etc. Maybe this is real life but it makes for boring, repetitive reading. We've been hearing for three books now about how she can't sleep at night, due to her unceasing nightmares - enough already! The rest of this book was actually quite good (though I agree, not enough Nick) and I found the other characters much more interesting than Maggie."
3,A very different Maggie O' Dell novel,"This novel in the Maggie O'Dell series deals with a religious cult and how they are tied to a series of serial killings, or are they? I'll admit that I was a little disappointed in the story line of this novel as this not the best Kava book I've read; I figured out what was really going on halfway through, but it's still an entertaining book, and the character Maggie is always well polished and interesting, regardless of the plot. Maggie's relationship with her mother is explored in this novel, and some very interesting truths about her past come to light. Even with the plot being a bit ""loose"", and easy to figure out, the book was still enjoyable, as all Alex Kava novels are."
3,FUN AND FAST,"I must admit to have enjoyed this one, with reservations. First, The book is a quick read and a fun read...nice to just set and let the author spin a good tale and go with it at times.The plot was intriquing and characters well done. The profanity might have been a bit over done, but as to that, from what I hear from the young now days, it was pretty accurate...I just got a bit tired of it is all. All in all I have to recommend this one...maybe not actually buy it, but it would be a good one to check from the library."
2,Disappointed - A predictable thriller,"I was really looking forward to this new book. I usually wait for the paperback - but after reading her first two novels, I bought the hardback.The story start with a standoff with the FBI and the ""group"". The story starts off in classic Kava style. Quick, lots of tension and keeps you turning the page. And then... it goes very slow. I knew (not guessed) the ending at around page 150 (out 300). Not much of a suspense thriller.Overall, a ok read - wait for the paperback if you are a fan. Or just wait for her next book. I have not given up on her but was disappointed with this effort"
3,NOT THE ALEX KAVA READ I USUALLY GET,"I have to say.... I am really disappointed in this third outting. Every August I wait until Ms. Kava's books are out and this one was like no other wait. Unfortunately, it was not worth the wait. I fell inlove with Ms. Kava's two previous novels (A Perfect Evil and Split Second- both 5 star and above novels). Imagine my disappoinment trying to get through this book. Took me a week and a 1/2. Normally her books take a maximum of 3 days with me.Maggie was a lush in this book with such a wall around her, you almost didn't care for her. And Greg!!!!! Get rid of him. Its a no-child divorce that should've been done with at the end of the last book. Heck, she has enough of her own money, so whats the hold up? I want more NICK MORELLI. This is too long of a tease. And the plot just seemed to drag on when I knew who the killer was half way through. Still, I eagerly await any other book Ms. Kava writes. She is on my list of faves and I am not giving up on her yet!"
2,So much potential,"Alex Kava is talented writer. However, as I began working through the series, I was dissapointed by both her formulatic style and the aggravating lack of an ending. Each and every book by Kava, including Soul Catcher, falls off a cliff at the end, leaving the reader with a multitude of questions and no resolution. This is not ""Lost"" style intrigue - just a lazy method to try to get readers to pck up the next installment. Can't recommend."
1,What a bad book,"I have never taken the time to post a bad review about a book and I do read quite a bit. That said, I don't recall EVER having read a book that was as simple and lacking of cliffhanging than this book. I would suggest reading this book if YOU are considering writing a book because the only value in reading this book comes from the realization that, apparently, anything can sell in today's world."
5,"Great single, and who doesn't love copyright laws?","This single came out during their earliest days. It's a great song, but there was a small problem. They sampled the bassline from Cannonball by the Breeders without asking, and as a result, were told to pull the single from the market (which is why you never find it new anymore). But it was still a great song, so they changed it a bit, put in a new bassline, retitled it Blisters on my Brain, and put it on the album. So what you have here is essentially a single for that track. It has a radio edit and regular version. Amazon has an incomplete title. The third track's full title is Disco Machine Gun (Part II: Many Tentacles Pimping on the Keys). This is the same track as appears on the On the Floor at the Boutique album. Phat Puppy Number One is a good track, and should be had by any completionist. This single is good stuff, and the Cannonball bassline doesn't take away from the song if you've heard the other version first."
2,Review of TEAC GF-350 Turntable/ CD-Recorder,"I received the unit and when I tried to record an ""ERROR 04 "" ""07"" kept coming up on the unit which would not allow me to record. When I called Technical Service I was told the CD's were bad and to get the ones that are individually packed. I did and when I tried to record I got the same response. When I called again I was told the unit needed an adjustment. Now I have to travel over 75 miles to get the unit adjusted or I could pay to have the unit shipped back to California.I now have bought 2 sets of CD""s and are looking at either a shipping or travel expense to fix a problem that is a manufacturing problem. By the time I can get it fixed I will probably be told it is out of warranty. How can TEAC help to assist in getting this problem fixed???"
1,Dissatisfied,The Teac Gf-350 turntable arrived broken. Neither the retailer nor Amazon would make good on my purchase. Two months later I am out $368 and have nothing to show for it. Definitely stay away from this product. There are others out on the market now which have more features.
4,Nostalgic turntable & CD burner with AM/FM radio,"Nice unit/attractive cabinet. Inputs are nice, but the stereo lacks output capability. Speakers are good for the unit size, but definitely not audiophile quality. Negative - no on-off remote capability. No regrets in buying it."
3,Returns,"This item was ok, but my husband and I wanted a feature on the remote control, that this item didn't have. We wanted to adjust the AM/FM stereo stations and volume with the remote control. That was an important thing to us, so we decided to return it. In order to return this item to electronics-expo, once the box has been opened is very costly. You have to pay for the shipping to you (which is approx. $20.00), pay a 20% restocking fee (which in my case was $40.00) and than pay for the shipping back to them. When all was said and done, I was out approx. $80.00. How do you know if your going to like the item until you open the box and check the item out? I will never order anything from electronics-expo ever again."
4,TEAC GF-350 Review,"The TEAC GF-350 arrived in perfect condition. This is an attractive unit that fits well with other stereo components. It is substantial in size so you need a good surface for it to operate from and high enough to see the controls well and open the turntable lid. I bought this unit to preserve a 40 year old record collection. The unit records well once you read the instructions and understand how to separate the tracks properly and how to finalize each recording. You must also ensure you use ""music"" CDs otherwise you will think the unit doesn't work when it actually does. The unit operates quite well - the record player, the CD player, the radio, and it has input for other analog sources. It doesn't play back with much volume, but is adequate for any small room. My only disappointment is that the recordings are not as dynamic as a commercial CD and you have to boost the volume and tonal settings to enjoy the playback. Overall - a great unit at a good price."
1,Dissappointing,"i've returned my unit 3 times as it's had numerous faults. Error 01, 02, 03, 04 & 05 yet under my warranty repair they found no fault which leaves me with a useless piece of equipment. CD's have gotten stuck and were only able to be retrieved after turning the unit off, then on again. Unit takes far too long to recognise the disc placed in the recording tray. When it works, it records with insufficient bass and there's no tonal control to correct that - i get better results with an external record player plugged in the auxiliary.There is no output to connect it to another amp and the speakers on this unit are only small.If you accidentally stuff up a track when recording on audio CD-R, you cannot delete it, you just have to record your track again and leave the first attempt on the disc.When i've used CD-RW they record, but will not play back in any of my other CD playersA very dissappointing product."
1,Defective,The unit would not record to the CD......followed all instructions and used correct CD's.......returned for credit.
3,"Not great, but OK","I tried a friend's machine (that is now on e-bay). The recording was ok but when I tried to clean it up from a rw disk, the file name was either unrecognizable or had to be converted for editing. I then tried to enter the tracks into my i-tunes and they came our very warbly. The disck from the machine seems to play ok but if you want to edit, clean, reduce pops and clicks, forget about it."
4,TEAC CD-Recorder,Item was exactly as shown. Very please so far with the performance and apprearance.
3,Tinny sound,"The company service was excellent, and the product operated as described. However, the sound was thin and tinny. The company offered to take it back, but I had already started using it for recordings, and had thrown away the papers and packaging, so am playing the CDs on a better machine."
1,not worth the trouble,"Easy to use, but why bother. The tinny sound quality reminded me of a wire recorder from the 1950s. The lack of base and generally tinny sound could not be corrected within my equalizer capabiity. I hope there are better alternatives."
3,Problem with 78's is,"they need a different stylus (needle). Its elliptical shaped so it gets the sides of the recording grooves. The stylus for 33 and 45 is literally a evenly pointed arrow. Hence poor response for 78 and OK for 33 and 45.One needs to change the cartridge to a Shure 78 stylus, about $50 or so, you do it yourself. Also get the shure alignment and tracking force guage, another what $25????? Am in process now doing this, I have had the Shure items several years. Was not aware that 'someone' sold these units with a CD recorder already in it, have been trying to use my turntable with a Sony AV receiver, and my laptop CD.....Good luck you all, it should work but you must mod it for 78's.Google for more info."
4,improved,"This is an improvement over the previous model. The biggest is that the phono arm retuns automatically after an album plays. And obviously the CD recorder is a plus. It works well for converting old albums into CDs but is very labor intensive. You really can't leave the room while recording as you need to manually make the track increments. It would be nice to have audio out connections to hook it to a good speaker system; but recording, not playing is the reason to get this unit. Overall I'm pleased with it."
4,TEAC GF-350 TURNTABLE,"I am thrilled to have this turntable and finally be able to put my records on CD. This unit is very easy to operate. The biggest drawback would be the lack of bass/treble adjustment if you are using this for listening, as opposed to recording onto cd's. Also it would be nice if you could stack your records - especially 45's. Overall I am very happy with the product. I received this from the vendor in excellent condition, and in a few short days!"
3,Misdirected Anti-Piracy,"I'm sure this is an excellent product. I have not had a chance to use it yet, however, because of the stupid requirements to use a particular type of ""digital audio""CD. How many CDs do these idiots think I can create? Certainly not enough to quit my day job. As soon as I can find some ""digital audio"" CDs, and pay the premium required to ensure that the owners of the original copyright are reimbursed (and I suspect this premium will not allow them to quit their day jobs, either) I'm sure I'll be very satisfied with this equipment.Now, had TEAC included a couple of ""digital audio"" CDs in their package, I would probably been well on my way to being a satisfied consumer."
4,TEAC GF-350,"THIS PRODUCT LIVES UP TO ITS BILLING. VERY USEFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LARGE RECORD COLLECTION, WITH MANY NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON VINYL OR CDs. i CAN RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
2,Disappointment,"While the turntable PLAYS LPs well, the unit will not record to CDs.To have it checked and have a repair estimate done will cost $75. (which goes toward repair cost).Sorry I bought it, and sorry I let this slide so long.Elliott"
1,Don't Throw Away the Remote!,"I bought this unit because it seemed easy to use. But, the FM reception was terrible and the sound quality of the CD playback equally poor, so I was discouraged from recording anything. Months later, when I decided to give it a try, the remote control had misplaced during an office renovation. That was my stupid fault, but nonetheless, I couldn't use the unit for simply enjoying music in my office in addition to burning CDs. Anyway, this control is not really an optional remote control in the traditional sense, but an integral part of the unit, and used to separate the tracks on the LP, so keep track of it. Believe the reviews who say the playback is poor. And the ones that say that without ""cleanup"" software to remove hiss and crackle, the unit is pretty worthless. I ended up tossing this recorder and subbing a much less expensive Audio Technica USB turntable, which comes with audio cleanup software."
2,"Close, but no cigar!","It works well enough, but not having a tape player built in is a real downer. I can't recomend it."
2,alittle dissappointed,"unless there is a way to take out all the hisses and ticks from your vinyl, the cd`s don`t sound good at all. Maybe we are spoiled from the digital world and downloads from the internet that sound better but I think this machine is outdated..Pat"
1,A lot to be desired,"This product tends to overheat or something. I was lucky to get one LP album recorded to CD before it froze up. Generally, I would have to wait for a 1/2 hour or so before trying to record again.When I first set the product up to play the eject button would not work. And then, all of a sudden, it began working.I sent the product back and ordered a replacement. As of today, the product is still enroute via UPS from New Jersey. If I encounter the same problems again I will request a refund and buy a different product locally."
1,"Easy to Use, But....",the sound quality is so horrible I'm returning mine... I don't understand why no company can put out a decent system to do this. Obviously there's a demand for it....
2,Limitations,"Nice Looking. Easy to operate. But the stylus is for 45/33/78? Not good. 78's don't sound like they should. Manual says 50 hours of recording is when the stylus needs replacement. The cartridge is also pretty poor. The sound seems very limited. I doubt that the low frequencies below 80hz are recorded, consequently the recordings sound hollow or shallow. Also the upper end, to eliminate record noise obviously is also cut off at a relatively low level. Records played on my regular home stereo sound loads better and using a MAGIX program on my computer and re-recordable CDRW's produces much better copies. In fact, better than the lp's sounded originally. If you have records that you can not replace (as I have) this recorder is handy and easy for anyone to use, but if you're serious about high quality, look further. I was considerably disappointed."
3,new life for my old lp's,"Nice idea, and it works well so long as your lp's are in good shape with no major scratches--if not, you'll get constant error messages and recording with cease. Also, tracking is manual, so be prepared to stay close to the recorder to manually make the track changes. Having said that, I'm still glad to have it as I have lots of lp's that willl never come out in cd format. Also, the recording media are hit or miss, working about 70% of the time, so be prepared to waste quite a few CD-R Music discs."
1,Not What I Expected,The discs that were recorded had transistor radio sound quality. This product was no where near what I was expecting.
2,CD Recording,"Sound quality was much less than expected. The addition of some type of tone-shaping or equalizer would greatly enhance the product. Unit is very easy to use, quite straight-forward; however if you are looking for a much higher-level of sound reproduction, this unit would not meet your standards."
4,Great With Limitations,"I was initially skeptical, but now I am glad I made this purchase. I have already successfully copied over 100 albums to CD's. The quality of the copies are good, even with the static (adds a touch of nostalgia). The quality of the sound when played on the player is rather thin and weak. But when played on a stereo system with good speakers, it sound great."
1,End use,"Recently purchased this item in order to convert quite a number of records to CD. It is difficult to use, but the big drawback is the inability to remove clicks that most older records have after they are converted to CD's. The music format will not load in my computer so I cannot use a program to remove clicks recorded on the CD from the records. Other products provide this ability. I cannot recommend."
3,Close but no cigar,"Would it have killed them to add auxiliary OUTS? Yes it has aux ins, but outputs would have allowed you to capture individual tracks direct to the soundcard of a computer without burning a CD first."
5,LP's to CD easily-just like the old days,This reminded me of when I used to put LP's & CD's on cassette so I could play them in my car. Now I can finally put LP's on CD! Very simple to use. You just have to get the Digital Music CD's and you're all set.
5,teac recorder,My husband is obcessed with this thing. But he still needs to copy my old cassettes onto a CD. Highly recommend buying this for a music buff.
1,Unlawful Supplier,"The Vendor should be shut down by the FTC, I ordered as it said ,""IN STOCK"", well it wasn't the Company took the money from my Credit Card Company, than advised me after that it wasn't in stock and would be back ordered, [after my card paid them].... against the LAW....."
1,A Very Unhappy Customer,"I returned this item on 1-22-07 and they have not credited my credit card. I have submitted a complaint to American Express. I have submitted proof of the return delivery from UPS to Michelle and Cheryl at Electronica Direct. My next step will be to file a complaint with the State of New York Attorney General's office. I will not use Amazon again until this problem is resolved. As a previously satisfied customer of Amazon, I am disappointed that you are supporting this company and are not assisting with resolving this problem."
3,Be careful,"The sound system is good. When I tried to record the record on to the CD, I didn't know I had to use CD-R Music.Instruction manual did not specify. Manual just said CD-R. I was unable to return CD-R in exchange for CD-R Music because I had already opened the package. I'm out of $20,00 because of that."
1,EXTREAMLY DISSPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This has turned out to be a major waste of money. Yes it does what it states but the sound quality is garbage. There's no bass, non what so ever. I don't understand I would totally happy with the product had they added a bass adjustment or at least put better speakers in. A great idea that fell way short. Just another example of ""if it sounds to good to be true it probably is"""
3,Near Miss,I bought this item with the intention of using it asa component in my stereo system.It never occured to me in my wildest dreams that a four hundreddollar Teac unit would be designed without a LINE OUT.That really limits its versatility. I returned my purchaseas a result. Your needs may be different.
2,Big Disappointment,"i couldnt wait to get this thing out of the box,but when i did....what?the sound is horrible.you can't run it through another amp because there are no output jacks!so you can't hear a damn thing if you leave the room.this machine is only good for one thing and that's to burn vinyl to cd.every other element of it is very sorry.boo!!!!!!"
2,Poor instructions,"I cannot record 78s. The 350 records the scratch at the start of the 78 but does not record music.I searched the internet to find TEAC support for the 350 and cannot find any. They list a number to call in California,but I am afraid I will have to punch a bunch of numbers while their phone system tells me my call is important. I would be hesitant to buy any TEAC produt again"
2,Below expectation,"The TEAC GF-350 Turntable/CD recorder was not what i was led to expect. the sound quality was very bad, no base. I played one LP and decided to return it at my expense."
3,good but a bit heavy,Lots of good features. especially the ability to play vinyl. Only issue is that the unit is relatively large -which is because it must be in order to play the records. Otherwise I am very happy with it.
1,Avoid this Product,"Our TEAC GF-350 has never worked properly. The turntable component cannot play a record to the end without skipping. We took it to a local authorized repair shop where it sat for seven months waiting on a part that never came. We then sent it to TEAC, who proceeded to fix the wrong component (the CD player) and sent it back. The record player still does not work. This is a cheaply made product. There are many other options, most of which cost less, on the market. AVOID."
1,Nothing but problems,"From the time this unit was removed from the box, it has been a nightmare. This main problem is each and every record, both 45s & lps, skips at the end on the last track. My records, friends and even neighbors.I returned the unit to Teac, and the seemed quite good about the turn around with the repair, in which they claimed to have replaced the enter turntable assy.But, it is doing the same thing again, right out of the box.I would not recommend this monster"
1,injustice,"this is when dre was in the wrecking crew back when purple rain ruled the charts and this was 2pac's group before anybody heared of him go to the next cd, cause this ain't hitting here."
4,Like Doan - Love Carstairs,I have read all the books in this series and liked them all. It is a shame the author came to such a sad end. This is the only one done after WWII and involves a convoluted story line set at a small college in California. Let's face it the story line is fine but it is Carstairs that keeps me coming back. He isn't a Disney dog. he doesn't talk and you don't read what he is thinking. It is up to Doan to interpret for you through Carstairs' body language and the byplay is the best part of the book. I like the one's with the WWII background better but this one is good also.
2,ACDelco GF90 Fuel Filter,I bought these thinking they were just the non-painted I need for my 65 Chevy. These are larger diameter and won't fit the factory bracket.
4,Great Toy,"My baby have 6 months and likes a lot this toy, he loves when we sing the song and show how to count. its a good toy."
2,Not worth the money,"Plays two songs(If you can call them that)- One for counting - One for colors. Up there with Barney in regards to voice and melody. Not very interactive - You squeeze him and he counts items in his book or tells the child to find color. There is no option to actually select the answer so interaction is minimal.We enjoy so many of the other Leap Frog products, this one was a disappointment. Neither my 14 month old nor my 3 year old are interested in Tad at all. It was a Christmas present that I would not have chosen. For lack of a better word, this toy is the most anti-climactic in our home."
4,it's great,"This Learning Friend - Tad toy is really great. I really love leapfrog. I have all the DVDs and the LeapFrog Fridge Phonics alphabet set. I bought this toy for my nephew when he turned two. He didn't seem interested in it at first but once he pressed the buttons and Tad started singing his numbers in English AND Spanish, my nephew grew fond of it instantly! I really did not think it was worth over $20 though but my nephew loves the toy and that's all that matters! It's really a good toy for kids ages 9 months and up. Buy it and you wont regret it. :)"
1,Equivelent to giving your child pool chemicals to play with,[...]Every parent interested in this toy should know the chemical levels in this toy. Read this page.. The level of chemicals such as Chlorine and otheres is ridiculous.
4,Nice simple educational toy,"This is a cute toy. I bought it for my son when he was around 9 months old. He loved it for about a month. It's cute and colorful, and it sings. But it only sings the alphabet. After awhile, it gets old for kids and parents alike. For the money though, it's a pretty good deal on an educational toy."
1,Tad is very boring for my daughter,"We were given Tad as a gift and at first we thought this would be a great educational toy. I thought the clarity is great and being biligual is very informative. Now the negative, Tad is just annoying. He sings the same ""Hi, I'm Tad and you can count on me"" before every verse and it is just too repetitive. He then saye "" I have lots of brilliant colors"" before the next verse- over and over and over. The small book that is attached to his hand is way too small for any child to find interesting. We received him when my daughter was 11 months and now that she is 17 months, she still won't touch Tad even when I push the buttons for her.I would not recommend this toy unless you are looking for another noisy and annoying toy for your little one."
2,My Boring Friend Tad,"Boring & Not Suitable for Independent Play, this toy wasn't really designed with babies in mind, not even older babies. Toddlers in the 2+ range can probably figure out how to turn it on and off and activate the few songs it sings."
4,Cool Frog,My daycare kids like the frog but it confuses them because they keep hitting the language button. I think it would have been better to have a switch on it's back to use to change the language. But other then that the toy is great and very fun!
2,Sort of alice in wonderland in pictures?,"I actually didn't like it since the whole problem of identical twincommunication has never been really well resolved.To call it 'supernatural' and base a movie on that misunderstandingwill probably not do a lot of good.Confusing images and surreal type of effects may be very arty,but situations like this are real and need understandingand science and not Sagan's 'Demon filled World'..."
4,Shouldn't have been grouped with punk rock,"These guys should have been bigger.They were great musicians. Played in a power trio format, Bruce Foxton's bass was powerful, countered the melodies of the guitar, and was up front in the sound. The guitar playing was right out of early The Who. Paul Weller developed into a real fine musicianAnd boy, live these guys were the real deal! They rocked!When punk/new wave died, they were ignored and changed their sound. They should have stayed with their original sound! The Stylel Counsel stunk and even know Weller is worshipped in England, The Jam was his zenith!"
1,Martins confuses yet again,"The Inventions, who can be utterly intimate gems as well as playful little wonders turns into lukewarm water in the hands of Martins. Uninteresting performance miles away from what Bach intended. Listen to Glenn Gould or Andras Schiff and you'll understand."
1,I didn't even get the right item,I ordered a large shirt of the one pictured but I got a completely different gray one that was XL
4,Great Value Kichler Light,"This light was well priced at $58. IF I had paid the regular price of between $150 and $250 I would NOT have been happy as it looked like a high quality cast aluminum fixture that turned out to be a much lighter duty stamped aluminum product. Great at the price I paid, but would have been sent back if I had paid the regular price. The 5 glass pieces are very nice and very well packaged to protect it during shipment."
2,Batman vs. Blight,"""Batman Beyond: No Place Like Home"" is written by Sholly Fisch (based on a story by Hillary J. Bader) and features illustrations by John Delaney and Dave Cooper. The story is set in the world of the ""Batman Beyond"" TV series, in which an elderly Bruce Wayne has passed the duties of Batman on to young Terry McGinnis. In this adventure, told in comic-book format, Batman battles the villain Blight and encounters a group of orphans living in tunnels under the city.The story is effectively told and contains some solid action scenes. The characters are well drawn, particularly the creepy Blight. However, the book's weak aspect is its handling of the very serious themes of homelessness and orphanhood. This problematic aspect of the book ultimately leads to a too easy, distastefully saccharine resolution."
5,Funny,I am a big fan of almost anything from Disney and love the Phineas and Ferb show. This collection is great
3,The Perry Files DVD,"Cute movie, my kids love Phineas and Ferb, but I wish there were more episodes on there. It isn't a very long movie."
4,"DVD Review: ""Phineas and Ferb: The Perry Files""","Disney's ""Phineas and Ferb"" is one of those animated shows that immediately caught on with not only children, but teens and parents. As an adult watching the show, much of the attraction is due to the adventures of Perry the Platypus as he battles Dr. Doofenshmirtz. Fans of all ages can now enjoy the character's antics whenever they want with the DVD release of ""Phineas and Ferb: The Perry Files.""The "" Phineas and Ferb: The Perry Files"" Two-Disc Combo Pack will provide hours of fun for the kids and you. If you're trying to get a little time to yourself, Perry never fails to keep the young ones entertained. It's also a show that won't leave older viewers attempting to gouge their eyes out like they want to while watching other annoying animated shows."
4,What Happened to Chi-Ali?,"The early 90's saw quite a few kid rappers and Chi-Ali's album was among the best. I remember listening to this CD back in 92 and it had a good flow. Before Aaliyah made it famous, Chi hit us with the track ""Age ain't nothing but a #"" and it was one of the reasons why i liked the CD so much. Other good songs are Jump to the Rhythm, Murder Chi Wrote, and Funky Lemonade. It is tragic what happened to him when he got older, but lets remember him for his contribution to hip hop, not for what he did!"
3,"WOW, I JUST REMEMBERED WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS ALBUM","man, when i saw this album on here, i think about where he is now, and it's a shame. i remember when my man came out with AGE AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A NUMBER. i remember when where i was, it was this temporary big deal. then i remember the remix for ROADRUNNER. then i remember him in black sheep's PASS THE 40. then i found out he was dres' brother. then i remember hearing this album. the first time, i remember falling asleep. the second time, i remember thinking to myself, THIS IS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN DISAPPOINTING AND OKAY FOR AN INTRODUCTORY ALBUM. this made me wait for the second album. shoot, i am still waiting. i doubt that there will never be considering where he is now. other than that, this would be a good throwback album for me these days. i betchabip that i'd probably like it now that my ears are more mature."
5,Great!,"This CD was excellent. It covered Jeff's work in this era more so than Beckology did. What Beckology didnt have, this did. Great best of CD."
4,It Rocks My Plimsoul For Sure,"Super compilation featuring some awesome Jeff Beck guitar licks. The man displays great power and creative touches on his guitar. Sometimes loud and sometimes soft but always good.And of course there are some awesome contributions by Rod Stewart, Mick Waller, Ron Wood, and Nicky Hopkins. The version of Jailhouse Rock is just mind blowing. What lightning fast fingers on the keyboards by Mr. Hopkins. I've Been Drinking is another highlight with some excellent vocals by Rod set to a nice gospel backing. The guitar solo just sends shivers down my spine. Rock My Plimsoul has a great tone and Love Is Blue features some nice color on the guitar tones.This is a near five star compilation. A few tracks are a bit overdone most notably All Shook Up is totally unrecognizable from the original. Its done too heavy handed. Spanish Boots also suffers a similar fate and Rice Pudding goes on a bit too long. However, out of sixteen tracks about ten or twelve are clearly Grade A."
4,Young Catherine,"This is one of my favorite historical dramas, but it needs to be in DVD format with no cuts."
5,Young Catherine,I loved the full length version of this that originally aired on TNT some time ago. This VHS version has been edited and is missing a lot of the back story. Hopefully they'll release this Young Catherine w/ Julia Ormond (not the one with Catherine Zeta-Jones) on DVD as originally shown.
1,Young Catherine,Product was presented by you as being the long version of 186 minutes but after viewing and timing the movie it came out just over 150 minutes with many sections missing we were familiar with from our older movie we wanted to replace. That is why we sent it back for a refund. We are still looking for the 186 minute version of Young Catherine. Tim Voegtle
2,There's a reason he didn't publish it.,"It's not very good. The overture is decent, but it's all downhill from there. The performers did a fine job of it, but I don't know what possessed them to do it in the first place."
3,Code Breakers,"Very good portrayal of a challenging event in West Point history.The additional coverage with interviews of men like Pete Dawkins, Jack Jacobs , Norm Schwartzkopf and Roger Staubach provided superb background for an understanding of the Honor Code issue."
1,Run very small!,"I have bad knees so I thought these socks may help. I'm a size 14 in women's so ordered the largest size (XL) available. I could not get the sock up to my knees they were way too small/tight. My calf skin was bulging over the sock and cut off my circulation! No I'm not fat in my calves, I have very firm muscles, I do alot of walking daily since I have 7 dogs. In XL these should have fit. I've returned them, of course I expected a full refund since they were never worn but they subtracted $7.34 from my return because I opened one package (to try it on) and they call it a repacking fee? Glad they don't charge me to try things on in stores. Be warned, not only do they run small but you'll be charged for trying them on!"
2,not correct size,Received item quickly but definitely was not a 2x...couldn't get over my knee. Didn't bother sending it back!!!!! Pricing was cheap so will give it away
5,Will be an instant favorite,"A ""must"" for anyone who enjoys the taste of butterscotch in their candy, cookies, ice cream, or puddings, Diana Dalsass' Butterscotch Lover's Cookbook will be an instant favorite! Showcasing more than sixty easy-to-make recipes ranging from Butterscotch-Pecan Tassies; Butter Brittle Bread Pudding; Butterscotch S'Mores; and Butterscotch-Graham Cake; to Easy Butterscotch Fudge; Butterscotch Truffles; Butterscotch Shortbread; and Butterscotch Chip Cookies, the Butterscotch Lover's Cookbook with its mouth-watering, full color photography of what to expect will prove an indispensable addition to any dedicated butterscotch connoisseur's culinary reference shelf."
5,return all other books!,I have a lot of other preschool curriculum books and have started a home preschool. when this came in the mail I scrapped all other plans because these ideas were SO good! It is way more interesting and fun than other ideas and it really does teach the kids something. I am adding a little more pre-reading activities but other than that I am using ALL of the ideas and looking to get her other book!
3,Take A Stroll Through The Voyage Of Brotha Land,"In 1997, Thug/Rowdy Records released the group's second album, Soul Network - Program II, which included the popular ""Over & Over."" The album also featured rapper Tupac Shakur on ""Static,"" Terry ""T-Bone"" Sanders provides some nice chops on the guitar, while heavily respected underground rapper Saafir as always spits some dope rhymes. Dave Hollister's vocals are in top knotch, still sounding tight, and it shows through out the album. Also co-founder Big Brutha Soul aka the new jack swangah Chapmaster J provides some vocals as well as Wicked J."
5,ADDICTING SKA/REGGAE BAND FROM LATE 80'S EARLY 90'S,"''BREAD & CIRCUSES'' , BY FAR IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CD'S OF ALL-TIME !!! ( IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND, SINCE IT IS NOW OUT OF PRINT !!!) LUCKILY, I LOCATED A BRAND NEW CD ON AMAZON & IT WAS ONLY $ 9.00 + TAX !!! I USED TO GO WATCH BOP HARVEY PLAY @ THE OCEAN MIST ON MATUNUCK BEACH IN RHODE ISLAND...AMAZING LIVE SHOW, WHICH MANY OF US MISS DEARLY !!! IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND THIS CD, BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED !!!"
2,Loose Poop,"I liked that the ingredients list was full of healthy things and had no corn or fillers. My puppy liked the taste. However, I'm rating this a 2 because while on Wellness, he had the runs. His poop was always super wet and mushy and sometimes it would be all liquid. I've tried the Eukanuba Natural Wild Salmon puppy food and he likes that, it's also healthy without corn or fillers, and his poop is firm and normal."
3,High Price,"This is a good Dog food, But I found 4Health at Tractor Supply. It is equal to or better quality comparing the analysis. And the price is much better, half as much. My Lab loves it, firm stools, and has been eating it for 9 months. She has a beautiful chocolate coat. She really didn't like the wellness product that much, and she had runny stools while eating it."
2,Could not get firm stool with Wellness Just for Puppy,I had my Airedale Terrier puppy on Wellness Super Mix Just for Puppy from about 10 weeks to 14 weeks. During this time I had loose stools to no stools (i.e. the squirts). It was very frustrating. The ingredient list looks great and I was looking forward to feeding this kibble but it did not work out for my puppy. I switched her to my adult dog's kibble out of frustration and suddenly perfect poops. My adult eats Wellness Core orginal. I asked my vet if it would be ok to continue feeding the adult food to the 14 week puppy and she said it was fine.My recommendation is to buy a small bag of Wellness Just for Puppy at first and if you don't get good stools then switch to something else immediately - don't wait around like I did. Not every food is going to work for every dog.
2,Dog doesn't like it.,"This was the first food I fed my puppy. She's always been skinny and we can leave food out for her to nibble on all day. That is until we switched to a different dog food (Wellness core). As soon she tried her new food she ate the whole bowl! It's only her third day eating the new stuff and she's already visibly gained weight. It's kinda sad to realize that she's just been forcing herself to eat this food.I give it 2 stars because there's nothing wrong with the ingredients that I know of, but make sure your dog is willing to eat this bland food."
3,dogs just didn't like it!,"I have 4 dogs and nobody wanted to eat this... I'm sure it's great quality, but I want my dogs to eat something they like... I will stick with my royal canin! 3 Stars because the package is a thick zip-lock."
4,I like it but,Every vet I ahve talked to thus far has told me to use Hills Science Diet.. they said its the best out there..I really liked wellness though.. our dogs liked it and were healthy.. I am trying science diet.. the kids seem to like it even more so maybe Ill just mix the two...
3,Better than most,"This food is definitely a step above grocery store brands but my dog could not tolerate the grain and had loose stools for 2 months which she also had on royal canin, switched to Orijen puppy food and all Is well"
3,Wellness puppy food,"My boston terrier/english bulldog puppy's coat became shiny on this food, his breath smelled good, his gas wasn't stinky, and the food appears to have excellent ingredients. However, after over a month of eating Wellness, his stool never became firm (which it was on whatever cheap food he was eating at the breeders). It alternated between runny and mushy. I'd read similar reviews on various websites, but decided to try it anyway (everyone's experiences are different). Although I have no way of knowing this, I wonder if some of the fancier dogfoods overdo it with the flax and greentea---it would certainly give me the runs. Anyway, I think it's a good food and may work well for some dogs, but we've had to transition off of it to Merrick puppy plate, which, although it has similar ingredients, seems to be firming up the poop."
5,We BOTH love it.,Great food that the dog loves and can't wait for. Was recommended all around and I'm very pleased.You do tend to use a little more of it than some foods but for the price on Amazon you can't beat it.
3,Cruzin',"I don't like rap, or hip-hop. But that is what this album is, a mixture of rap, hip-hop, salsa, and dance. I love tracks you can dance to, and a lot of these have a good beat, namely Sabrosura and Negra Chula. This CD is good for anyone who likes any type of music in DJ Laz's mixture. Surely, for combining all these different types of music and pulling them off, is what makes DJ Laz such a talented performer. He also has the ability to appeal to such a wide range of audiences. If you buy this CD, you are sure to be pleased. This album is definetly Cruzin'."
2,annoying author apis,"While the book may be very good, i only give it two starts because of the annoying author's apis and utilities that one must run in order to run the examples. So, if i want to run one of his examples, i now must also have his applications and that really bothers me because it distracts me from the example i am trying to run. A cookbook should not require one to have special pans or equipment to make your average meals or recipes, otherwise, what is the point of a cookbook? Give me examples that i can run on my own without his tools. That would be helpful."
2,"""A Fast Food"" cook book","The author attempts to cover all the APIs of jdk1.2 through examples in this book which is very good.The examples are plenty and would impress the Java novice. However, the mistakes in the examples would generally not escape a professional eye.David Flanagan's book, Java Examples in a Nutshell, with its throughness is by far a superior book."
2,Este es el segundo que compro!,"Ya compré este producto dos veces. La primera vez,... un año después de instalado presentó oxidación y surgió un agujero! Por falta de opción, tuve que comprar otro del mismo fabricante ya que vivo en Rep. Dominicana y no tengo muchas opciones. Ya completó unos 4 meses que lo instalé. ¡Ojalá no pase lo mismo!"
3,ok gun,"I got this gun today and here's what i have to say about the gun.First of all the gun has alLot of metal parts and internal componets, it feels sturdy at grab,this gun doesn't have allot of detail like other models u, have to load each bb individually,the loading is a bit hard so u will have to implement some force don't be scared.the box comes with a very small bag of bb about 24,also this model doesn't have a safety switch witch is good for little kids.over all is a solid gun with no good detail, it shoots fairly hard and the magazine has a capacity of 12 bb's(THIS GUN IS MADE IN CHINA)"
2,fair-not great,"I was a bit disappointed in this book as it is just a repeat of so many of her other books. I guess if this is the first book by her you read it is ok, but I have still read much better. Borrow it and read someone else's--or just skip it altogether."
5,in perfect condition,The book was in great condition and arrived within just a few days. I am very happy with the product and seller.
2,Definitely not Premier quality.,These pellets have visible seams on them and are quite inconsistent. They don't shoot well at all in my crosman phantom(2-4 inch groups at 20 yds). The skirts aren't very good quality and show visible deformations. They do shoot better groups with a 600 fps gun but if you want an inexpensive pellet the destroyers are the ones to get. Iv'e managed sub 1 inch groups with the destroyers in my crosman pumpmaster.
4,These things can fly!,"Yeah these suckers go fast. I shot off one hundred of these today at small targets like soda cans and even bottle tops at 15 feet. I was going for accuracy with my Crossman 357 and these pellets well exceeded my expectations. They can rip through cans or sheet metal. I got near max velocity with this gun. Ofcourse target damage depends on the overall power of your gun and the power left in your co2 powerlet. Still, I highly recommend these pellets for target shooting, and just tearing stuff up."
5,Fantastic,I watched this when it was on PBS last month and thought it was one of the best documentaries I've seen. It left me wondering what happened to politicians like RFK. Why are we consistently stuck with less than stellar candidates for the most important job in the world?
4,A good shot look at RFK,"This is one of the good videos that gives a real, honest and accurate short look at Robert F. Kennedy. It just brushes over the highlights of his life but enough to get a since of who he was and who he was becoming and where it might have led if he was not stripped from this earth. Had some good footage and good accounts from people who were there and lived it. Great photos and footage of the two borthers before and during the presidency. Would be great to add to a Kennedy collection or anyone wanting to know more about RFK and the era or for anyone who wonders what could have been."
5,"Moving, Informative, Perceptive",The American Experience-RFK is an exceptional documentary of the growth of one of the most remarkable figures in history.
5,great book,"This was a great book, I read it a few years ago in paperback and have recommended it to many people. It spans three generations of women and each one is different and remarkable in her own right. Yes I would recommend this!!"
2,Not as good as it used to be,"When I used to go to hockey practices, this was one of my best friends. I used to study it like many other autograph hounds I knew, so as to avoid the embarrassment of not knowing who someone was! It was a great tool to have. Every year, Ross puts a revised edition out. The last two years I didn't buy it, but this year decided I should.To my utter dismay, she still has pictures from 1995 and even earlier! The stats, etc are alright, but the book is worthless. I could just go by my 1995 book! I really wish Ross would get some new pictures in here. That's what most people I know use it for! Until she does, I really don't see the value of buying another ""updated"" copy. Very poor."
3,"Poetic, but","Poetic and evocative, but with all due respect, the playing of an old man who no longer dances. Friedman's are one of the great revelations of my 60 years of piano. DANCES!! Strong, vital, singing and dancing piano. Find the story of Meyerbeer and Chopin arguing time signatures, and you will understand why Friedman's are incomparably the best Mazurka's ever recorded. But these are touching in a reminiscent way, the the phrasing is definitely eastern European, not French, Italian, or even Austrian."
3,very good,"I agree with the other reviews. In general I don't like accoustic music. And if it comes to guitar I prefer more crunchy Satriani, Johnson, Vai or Schenker. But Adrian Legg is the exception. Very subtle but with amazing technique and great feeling for melody he provides us with full blown songs. A real stunning experience for the ears and a very enjoyable listen."
5,Great book!,"Reading this book brought back good memories of working with Doug at the engineering firm. I laughed out loud at several of his stories. Doug has wonderful storytelling skills, a self-deprecating sense of humor and a sense of aplomb about any situation he gets himself into. You can easily put yourself in his place when you read the narrative. The sheep roundup story is great!I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in the Peace Corps or the foreign service...or anyone looking for a good read. You won't be able to put it down."
1,Again,"The fact of the matter is that this is a really bad book for several reasons. The book gives little to no insight into the life of a normal Peace Corps volunteer, but rather instead serves as a vehicle for Doug to boast about his exploits in a very pretentious fashion. The writing itself is very juvenile and undisciplained, just plain boring in many spots, and then trying to bring these boring stories to an exciting climax. If you are looking for a book that is going to let you know what it is like to have a normal existance as a Peace Corps volunteer, then it is my opinion that this is not the book for you."
4,Very good and it shows the importance well.,We had to watch this for school and we just finished it today. I thought it was a terrific film. The end was very sad but still good!
4,"Even still, it's a wonderful movie.","Jakob The Liar no doubt had it's bad reviews. But I loved it anyway; it was filmed nicely, it had an amazing story line, and it looked like it was filmed and crafted with great care. I will no doubt someday buy this on DVD. See this film without having any experience of any other movie -- just take it all in AS an experience. The ending may have fallen short; but... well... it retrospect it probably couldn't of ended any other way."
2,Not very interesting.,"Jakob the Liar isn't a great film. It has potential, but it never accomplishes much. The acting by the entire cast is good, but nothing memorable--everyone seems to be going through the motions. I couldn't get into any of the characters at all. The plot isn't that interesting either and the film is too long. It shifts from a comedic to a serious tone the entire time and drags a bit during the first hour also. Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't poor, it's just that it is not that satisfying. There are some scenes that are somewhat interesting though. Jakob the Liar seems to really try to be something, but it still ends up being quite dull for the most part. I actually give this movie 2.5 stars. It is between risky and satisfying."
4,Thanks!,This is a sample of the horrible things that happened those many years ago. It also helps one realize how important it is TO NEVER LOSE HOPE! All things are possible to the one who has the faith to believe...
4,Beware of the Reviews,"There are two films named ""Jacob the Liar"". The Robin Williams film (actually spelled ""Jakob the Liar"") is a remake of the film displayed above, which was an award-winning East German film of the 1970s. You can ignore any of the reviews below which mention Robin Williams, since they have been posted here in error."
3,So So,"This seems like a ""diet"" version of the holocaust. There are guards, dogs, people shot, but it's not all there. Main role played by Robin Williams.. Doesn't quite connect in my view beacuse I'm used to seeing him in more comical roles which conflicted while watching this movie. This movie reminds a bit last year's big Italian hit - ""Life is Beautiful"", the story is very much similar. I would rate this one a family movie, no extreme drama or harsh scenes as one might have expected."
