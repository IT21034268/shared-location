4,great product for beginners,"This is an excellent beginning course that will teach you to formulate your own sentences in the course's target language. Once you have finished the short program you will have a good understanding of the language's basic structure. This foundation will allow you to grow your language skills at a much faster pace. No single product will make you fluent in a language, but this is a great one to start with."
1,German for dummies,"This set of Cd is very simple, just gives you the basic. Even tough there are 8 cds on the set, it could be easily 3 or 4, because most part of the time you listen to the two ""students"" that speaks with Michel Thomas trying to speak correctly, or saying the phrases wrong. They are just terrible, the woman the whole program can't even speak ""ich"" correctly - she says ""ik"" the whole time. In fact is not a book trying to teach YOU German - is just a record from a classroom, where somebody is teaching others, but no you. If you think that with these eight cds you will be able to speak German, forget about it. You won't be able even to ask directions! If you are planning to travel to Germany, buy something best. If you think is nice enough to know some words in another language that you don't want to understand seriously, go ahead, buy this."
5,Just Great!!!!!!!,"10 minutes work outs is the best thing. Everybody can find 10 min (+ 3 min to warm up and 5 min to cool down) for a work out. And the programs are different, so you can choose one for every day of the week or do a combination if you have more than 10 min to spare.Tamilee Webb is very energetic and motivating, plus you have the clock on your screen to monitor the time left, that helps to keep up, knowing it's almost over ))."
5,Good exercise video,You can have it play all the sections or just pick and choose the sections you want to work on for the day. Nice to have the flexibility to work out for a half hour or a full hour. Tamilee Webb does a good job with the instructions - just wish it showed a little more of the stretches at the end of each section instead of fading out to begin the next section. Nice getting a 2 pk - great deal for the money.
2,Not as good her other videos,"I do a lot of exercise and this video was not a challenge for me.She wants to work abs, buns and arms all in 10 minutes, with poor results...I prefer her other videos."
4,Fun To Play With,"I got these for my grandsons to play with. It kept their attention for a while, but not as long as other toys. I think if I had more than one set then they would have played with it longer having more pieces. Overall, it is still a fun product for them to play with. (that is why I gave it a 4 star, but as for education - I don't see that in this toy except creativity so I still gave it a 3)."
3,CLODHOPPERS !,"These weighed a ton. They fit all right and everything, high quality and the color I like, but I had to ship them back, they were just too big and heavy. I opted for a low cut athletic style safety shoe with an alloy toe that weighs 1/3 less than steel toes."
4,really?!?!,"How anyone could expect a violin, bow, and case from this ad escapes me.I am reviewing my experience with SKB as a manufacturer of cases for equipment. It's pretty beefy. I would trust them to protect my daughter's violin but would like to see some numbers. If they had said it withstood x pounds in a crush test i would give them the fivestars."
1,not a viola,The picture on this iteam is very missleading. I bought this for my 10 year old and when she opened the package it was just a case . That was all she was so upset she cried because there is not a viola or bow. We where very dissapointed.
1,misleading ad,"I agree with the previous review.I also bought this for my 10 year old son, and when he opened the package it was just a case . That was all he got. he was so upset because there is not a viola or bow. We were very dissapointed"
3,Better options out there,I used this on my old Tamrac 519 case. I ultimately switched to the Lowepro Toploader series holsters when Tamrac was slow to introduce holster cases that were large enough to accommodate my camera with grip & 80-200mm f/2.8 lens. I was glad I switched - The competing Lowepro chest harnessis better designed and slips on more quickly.
4,Great Snare Head!,"I bought this Glass 500 for my 13x7 Pork Pie acrylic snare. I love it. It is pretty thick for a snare head so you lose a lot of sensitivity, dynamics as well. It is definitely a ""Rock"" snare head. The good thing about this head is that it is really good for deep snares. Now that I have this head on my snare, when I play shows, you can hear the depth to the drum as well, while when I used other head, I just had a really tight pop sound. It is a great head for deep snares and rock drummers."
1,unlistenable,"Baffled by the great reviews here - there were only two tracks I could stand to play all the way through! Pedestrian themes, elementary melodies, extremely tiresome electronic ""drums"" and other instrumentation, and no hint of this great cellist I was led to expect. Someone should have told this guy he can't sing. Sorry to be so down on what others seem to love, but it has gone straight into the Goodwill bag after one play. Not for lovers of melodic pop or of classical. Not sure who it's for, frankly. Seemed like the music of someone who doesn't get out nearly enough and listens only to what's in his own head."
3,Book and Record Set!,"This book, when new, comes with a 45 RPM record that follows its text, with narration by Kay Lande. While it would be nice to be able to play the record, the book is fine as a standalone story of the life of Helen Keller as a child. Many children will find the story quite compelling and, perhaps when they are older, become interested in Keller's story from her own viewpoint, inThe Story of My Life (Bantam Classic)"
1,if the crap in this bottle is massage oil than im michael jackson!,"what ever is in this bottle it is NOT oil...when you first pour it on, it looks like oil but it isn't, it quickly evaporates and with in seconds u are dry rubbing your skin or your loved one's.and the claim of the fresh minty feeling is non existant.... long story short, save your money, you will get way more satisfaction out of chaep bottle of regular mineral oil then u ever would from the crap in this bottle!!!!!!"
5,Great book. A must for any Library!,"Great book for any library. My only concern was with the seller. I ordered a Hardcover per the description, but received a paperback. I contacted the seller and they were willing to send a refund for the difference. The paperback was in great condition though and still made a great gift. Got my refund promplty though. If you order from them, just be patient."
3,Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,"I was recommended this novel by a teacher from Australia. We were looking for a science fiction style of genre and it seemed to suit, although one look at the front cover and some of my Yr 6 boys looked horrified.It took some perservence to get over the cutesy feel to the start of the story, but having just finished it, even the hardest of my 11 year olds were totally absorbed and really liked it. We were able to have some interesting discussions about morals eg stealing. My one criticism was the long and rather tedious way that the middle part of the novel was told by Nicodemus to Mrs Frisby."
4,Mrs. Frisby to the Rescue,"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh was a really good book, and I suggest that everyone should read it. It is about a widow mouse trying to help her son Timothy because he had pneumonia and they need to move to there summer home or face certain death. She then came across the rats of Nimh, highly intelligent creatures who could help Mrs. Frisby's dilemma.Usually when I was told to do something, and I was in the middle of reading it, I just couldn't stop because it is so good, but I did what I was told. It won the Newberry Medal and was winner of the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award. I give this book four stars for being so good. Maybe not everyone would like it, but they should still read it to find out. There is also a movie of this called The Secrets of Nimh. That was also good too. The author Robert C. O`Brien made other books that you might have heard of like The Silver Crown and Z for Zachariah. So if you like those books you would definitely like this."
4,Mrs. Frisby and Rats of NIMH,Mrs. Frisby is a widowed mouse who lives in a garden. Mrs Frisby also has a sick child who cannot be moved. Now anyone who lives in the garden knows you must be out of there before plowing time. Mrs. Frisby must turn to the Rats of Nimh for help. Mrs. Frisby soon finds out the rats have extrodinary intellegence. She not only finds a solution to her problem but is also able to help the rats with their problem. By working together all of the animals on the farm get what they need.If you enjoy the world of fantasy this is the book for you. After reading the first chapter you forget you are reading about rats and mice and you are drawn into the wonderful world of make believe. The book is easy to read and fasinating
5,Mrs. Frisby review,"Mrs.Frisby and the Rats of NIMH is one of the best books I ever read!It is a very adventurous book, there is a mouse named Mrs. Frisby. She is a widowed mouse that lives in a cinder block of a farmers farm. It is a pertect life for her and her childern, but oh no her child is sick! This is when the good part comes up! i'll give you a tast of it, she meets birds, rats, and Dragon the mean cat of the farmers and the most interensting part is that the rats have a secert, but you have to figure that part by yourselve! I hope you injoy the book. Have fun!"
5,Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh,This book was great. I had to read it for school and at first i was like do i really have to but once i got into it i loved it. Plus i read adult books and this book looked so juvenille i couldn't believe my teacher was doing this to me. I would deffinetly recommend this because i really enjoyed it.
3,Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh,"My book review is called Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh. I would recommend this book because it is such a good book to read. It's a story about a widowed mouse named Mrs. Frisby with her four small children she is faced with a terrible problem. She must move her family to their summer quarter immediatly, or face almost certain dearth. Fortunately, she encounters the Rats of Nimh, and extraordinary breed of highly intelligent creatures. Will Mrs. Frisby get the help she need from the Rats of Nimh, get rid of her dilemma?"
5,An Adventure through the Eyes of a Rat,"When Mrs. Frisby, the farm mouses son is kidnapped and taken away to NIHM, it is up to her to do whatever it takes to get him back. She goes to desperate measures, meeting interesting new characters all along the way. The story relates to real life in many ways; overcoming obstacles and doing whatever it takes for the one you love.When I read this book, I was in the third grade, and I loved it. It has since been reccomended for older grades, but I think third is a perfect year to read it. It is written for younger children to understand, and at the same time keeps the readers full attention.I loved this book. It is definetely one of my favorites."
5,My Most Favorite Book of All Time!,"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH is a story that I think all children should read. I usually don't read books more than twice (if it's really good), but I have read this book more than 4 times. I never get tired of it! Robert C. O'Brien has done wonders, and it really deserved a Newberry Medal! This book is really worth your while! :)"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,I absolutely HATED this book! It was so confusing and extremely BORING!I wish I could rate this book 0 stars but it won't let me! I don't recomend this book to NO BODY(you will fall asleep)! It is the most boring book on the face of the earth!!!!WARNING:DON'T READ!
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"A MOUSE in a DRESS? Intelligence SHOTS? Seriously, this book is a disgrace to all rodents. If you have any respect for your pet mice, guinea pigs, rats, gerbils or other pets DONT READ IT!"
3,Mrs. Frsiby and the Rats of N.I.M.H.,Mrs. Frsiby and the rats have to keep things cool while the rats have to move because of N.I.M.H.. That has changed them from the others. Timmy Mrs. Frisby's son is sick . They also have to move their house to the lee of the stone because of the tractor. Where the Owl told her to.This book was o.k all of the stuff that the rats do like the maze how they had to read to get food. An also they used string to get out of N.I.M.H.. You should get ready to come up with an ending. It leaves you in a cliff hanger.I would give this book three stars because it was good but it was not the best book I have ever read. I liked all of the adventure like when the rats escaped.
3,"Mrs., Frisby and the Rats of NIMH","Mrs. Frisby is a widowed mouse with four children. Her youngest child, Timothy, becomes sick and tries to get him some help. She gets advice from the wise old owl and uses his advice right away. The advice is to go talk to the rats. When she goes to ask for their help, Nicodemus, the leader of the rats, tells her the whole story about NIMH. In the end her house is moved and she has many friends.I personally, liked the book better than the movie. The book gave a lot of details and that's why it was my favorite out of the two. Although, it definitely wasn't my kind of book, because I like a little more action and a good story line. I think my eight year old brother would like it.I would rate this book with a three-star for children. This is a book you want to read if you like stories with talking animals and you have a mind filled with imagination and adventure."
5,READ THIS BOOK,"I read this book as well as its two sequels. All three were very good, although these books definately should be read in order. This book is about a mouse (Mrs. Frisby) whose home is a brick in the garden. Spring's coming, and they have to move to their nice home by the stream, but Mrs. Frisby's youngest son is too sick to move to another home. So, with the help of a crow and an old mouse friend, she enlists the help of the amazingly strong and smart rats of NIMH."
4,Mrs. Frisby & the Rats of NIMH Review,"If you like adventure, fun, and rats that talk to each other, then you should read the book Mrs. Frisby & the Rats of NIMH. It is by Robert C. O'Brien. It is a Newberry Honor book, too. The characters are very believable. My favorite part is when Nicodemus is telling the story of how the rats escaped from NIMH. I, however, did not like the ending to the book. I recomend this book to anyone 9 & up."
2,the rats plan for escape,Mrs.Frisby has a sick son with pneumonia.She needs to find Mr.Ages power to healtThe more she goes on the more action come with her.She finds herself face to face to an owl.Next thing she finds herself at the rats rose bush.She finds out the rats are highly inteligent and they can move her house till timmy doesnt get plowed by a plow.Then more truble comes to her and action.......
2,Mrs.Frisby and the Rats of M=NIMH,"I did not like the book . Also it wasn't well written . It needs to have action.In the book their is a mouse named Mrs.Frisby. She has four children . Timothy , one of her children , falls deathly sick . Moving day is coming early this year and Timothy cannot go out in the cold . She meets a young crow named Jeremy who brings her to the old owl in the woods . The old owl told her that nothing could be done . But when Jeremy says "" Come on Mrs.Frisby , I'm sorry that nothing will work . "" Then the owl says you're Jonathan Frisby's widow ? Then he told her about the Rats of NIMH . The rats help her move her house and she helps them get away from NIMH .I would rate this book in a 1-5 scale , I would give it a 2 . When I read it , it bored me . Their was only like one interesting if that ."
3,talking animals,"This was an ok book. The story about how the rats got smart was cool, but this book was about mice and rabbits and crows that talked."
1,"KIDS DON""T LIKE THIS BOOK!!!!","Speaking as a kid of 13 and an avid reader, this book made me sick. The first time I read it was in the third grade, and I almost wanted to throw it out the window. Overall, the character's were very unrealistic, I'd probably have an easier time believing that a piece of pocket lint was alive than these mice. I would give it zero star but that wasn't an option."
2,Mrs.Frisby and the Rays of NIMH.,"Our teacher made us read this book as a novel study, and I can say that it was an interesting read. Though it is interesting, the plot seems to simple for older children. I'd recommend it for children ages 9-11. Nicodemus's story of the rats escape takes up a lot of the story. If you are interested in animals I recommend this for you. Some people in my class found it boring and hard to concentrate on. It has excellent characterization though, and Mrs.Frisby is a very believable heroine."
2,not the cover in the photo,book was in fine condition but I expected the edition that was in the photo. That was the reason I picked/purchased this specific Vendor. overall everything was fine but it was not the edition I wanted.
3,it's ok,"I know this is a used book but I was disappointed that the entire spine and end papers were separating from the book. The end papers are only half attached to the covers. As it is difficult to find this book in large print I have taken the time to repair this book and buying special glue, etc. to reattach the end papers and fix the binding."
3,Wrong Cover,"I was expecting the book with the cover as advertised, but received one with the cover used for the audio CD. It doesn't change the contents, but I would prefer the one I ordered. Cost too much to return."
5,"One of the best stories of intelligence, danger, and triumph","Mrs. Frisby and the rats of Nimh is an entertaining story that the entire family will enjoy. The story of a little mouse that finds herself within a stange and urgent situation has to go to the rats in the rosebush for help before plowing up of her home comences. A story of intelligence, danger, and triumph unfolds throughout the pages of this book. In my opinion this is one of the greatest books for entertainment, plot, storyline, morals, and adventure. It is a must read!"
4,Mrs. Frisby - a Caring and Thoughtful Mouse,"The enchanted tale of Mrs.Frisby and the Rats of NIMH is ""gotta read."" Mrs.Frisby does many heroic deeds for her son, Timothy,such as: going two miles in the air-on a crow's back; going one mile up in a tree to speak to an owl; going into a rose bush to ask a stranger for help; and running right in front of a cat. For a small mouse saving her son, she makes the story happen. So, read this million seller book, it's amazing!"
2,good book,"This book is about a mouse namaed mrs frisby.She has a son who is sick with pneunomia and cant get out of bed.the problem is that Mr Fittsgibin (the farmer) is going to plow the field in 5 days!She must venture to a rosebush containing some unusual rats for help from these SMART rats that can read, talk, build, and most of all, steal.This book was very good but I gave it two stars for the crumy ending.It is well writen but if you are reading this book be prepard to not like its horible ending.It leaves all my most wanting to know questions unanswered.It does have a seaqle i have not yet read and I hope that it answeares my questions.All in All this book was OK.Dont buy it yourself though.thanks."
4,13ntheus,"Book ReviewI enjoyed the book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats if Nimh by Robert C.O. Brien. First, Mrs. Frisby (a mouse) is very brave and outgoing. For example, she saved a crow in cat-guarded territory!!! Also, she puts sleep powder in the cat's eating bowl. Second, the rats are smarter than any other rat type in the world. For example, the rats make their own machines and gears. Also, they plan for their future survival. Last of all, the animals use human items that were not being used. For example, the mice made a home from a cinder block. Plus, the rats used human items like car batteries, Christmas lights, strings, linen, cardboard boxes, metal sheets, dye, and many others! That is why I liked the book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats if Nimh."
3,Do you like Mrs.Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,It was ok but Mrs.Frisby and the Rats of NIMH isn't something that I usually read. It was a great book and I suggest people should check it out. And I liked how they put it in the animals point of view instead of just narrating. This is called personification. So if you're into those kinds of books check it out.
5,Great reading to children. Imagery is excellent,"In the fifth grade, my teacher read to us this incredible tale that stayed with me still today. Of all the memories I have about school, this book remains the most vivid. As an aspiring elementary teacher, I plan on making 'Nimh' a regular visit for myself and my students."
3,Rats!,"I would recommend this book to mystery readers. You must have the skill to put things together for you to truly understand the book. I think the best part of the book is the flow and subtly of the chapters. The story never goes off-topic and every big word had meaning. Another prominent feature of this book is its way of describing its characters. From the most important character to some of the least, each character is given a good description so you know exactly what the character is like. I would recommend this book, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, mainly to mystery readers, as I believe they would enjoy the book the most."
5,great for the whole family,"our family ( 2 adults and an 11 year old) listened to this on a long car ride, it was a very enjoyable ride. What at first seems like a cute story about a family of rats turns about to be a much deeper story. it is all about choosing to be good, even when it isn't convenient or easy. The story pulls you in and along with just enough excitement to keep you from putting it down. A wonderful gem for the whole family, although maybe too scary for 7 and under."
3,A pretty good book.,"Mrs.Frisby and the rats of Nihm by: Robert C. O'brien, is a pretty good book I would rate it 6-10 because often times its pretty boring, however there is alot of action parts too. My favorite charactor is Mrs.Frisby because she shows so much courage into saving Timothy but I'm not going to say how. I encourage you to read it because it has a great story line to it, some charactors are Mrs.Frisby, Timothy, Martin, Cynthia, Justin, Mr. Ages, Nicodemus, Dragon, and Jeremany. I hope you read it and enjoy it."
4,A very very good reveiw on a good book,"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh is a pretty good book. If you like mysteries and suspense you will enjoy this book alot.It has to do with a family of field mice that have to move but one of the children get sick. Mrs. Frisby finds her son and family in terrible danger. So she ends up with help from some interesting rats that might be able to save the Frisbies. I enjoyed this book alot it was very well written and very suspenseful, which leaves you wanting more."
4,"A wonderful, heart-warming book","Mrs. Frisby, a kind-hearted widow, wiht four children, has a problem. Her youngest son, Timothy has pneomonia. Another probelm she faces is the fact that Moving Day is approaching and Timothy is too weak to take on the journey. As the days go by, Mrs. Frisby meets a young, curious crow, an old, wise, owl, and an extremely intellegant species of rats hoping to find advice and help to her problems. WIll she succeed? Well, that is the question that is constantly asked in this book...I have really enjoyed reading Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH. It is a very heart-warming story that includes strong friendships, families, and hearts.I rate this book 4 and a half stars."
3,The Rats of NIMH,I just recently read Mrs.Frisby and the Rats of NIMH and I thought this book was okay. I thought it would be better and more excitment but it was still very good. If you enjoy fiction you will like this book. My favorite character is Jeremy the crow. Some parts are excellent but by then end all loose ends are not completely tied up. This book was a classic and it still is. Read this book see how you feel.
4,Rats and mice.,I like this book because it was interesting. The rats were intelligent and were doing interesting experiments. My favorite part is when the rats learn to read and they get themselves out of the cages. I also liked how the rats used rollers to move Mrs. Frisby's house. It was a good book. I give it 99 1/2%.
5,Exquisitely Intelligent!,"Finally, a book that is fit to be studied by Noachides at many different levels. For the beginner the book is written to provide clear and concise information on the Noachide Laws. The Advanced student isn't excluded. The richness of Dallen's research and notes provides years of study. This book is the ideal textbook for a class on the Noachide Laws."
1,Pagan bashing,"I am pagan and seek wisdom and righteousness where I can find it.To me this book spends too much time calling pagans evil which is rather foolish as all pagan means is people of the land--farmers, nature lovers, etc.It is possible to sing the praises of your own religious/spiritual beliefs without demonizing others, something this author should learn. His message failed to reach me as his insults closed my heart to his writing. I will seek information on the Noahide laws elsewhere."
1,Overrated,"People spend so much time giving ODJB credit for being the first ""jazz band"" to see a recording studio. Thats only because they had access to it. Someone said it's unfair to compare this group to greats such as Louis Armstrong, if thats true than it is unfair to give the Dixieland band credit for being the first band to record when other black artist didn't have that oppurtunity. The cd is good for what it's worth, but is definately over rated."
3,"A good plot, but I didn't like the style of writing","All together, this book was fun and I enjoyed reading it. The lead character, Jo, was likeable and somewhat realistic, and the plot twists kept my interest.The only thing was that I didn't like the style of writing. It was easy to tell that the author wasn't a teenager---the dialogue just didn't seem believable and, because the story is told from Jo's point of view, this kind of got annoying for me. The way Jo narrates is supposed to seem like it's written by a teenager, but it doesn't. It seems like what an adult might think a teenager would say. It's corny.I give this book 3 stars, because I thought the plot was very good but it wasn't well written."
4,How Not to Spend Your Senior Year,This was a fun read with clever twists of the plot. It showed how quickly little stretches of truth can get out of hand and lead to bigger complications!
3,acceptable,"Simon Pulse Romantic Comedies are always a fun read. These books are not necessarily the best written novels but the stories are always fun and you know you will get a happy ending. I think some adult romances could take a note from these books b/c they are characterized well which is much of the battle in writing any novel since you want your characters, for the most part, to be endearing and relatable."
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"After reading The Storyteller's Daughter, I had high hopes for this book. I almost put it down after the first two chapters to move on to the next book in my TBR pile. I should have. The dialogue was weak, the plot a cliche, and the character development pathetic (wait--WAS there character development?).Looking for a breezy way to pass study-hall? This might suit your needs. Looking for something a little more down-to-earth? Skip on to the next one."
3,How Not To Spend Your Senior Year,"Okay, this book wasn't all that bad. It was a bit unbelievable and fake, but overall the writing was cute and funny and the characters actually made sense. The ending was good, because I actually didn't expect Jo and Alex to... okay, I won't give away the ending. But I'm just glad it ended the way it did. But the book comes about a quarter of a way to crossing the line between ""happy and well-written"" and ""Boring with no sense of taste."" But after some of the reviews that I've read, I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would."
1,Conundrums - not really!,"I usually buy the Mensa Puzzle Calendar but opted to buy this calendar for a change. What a mistake! The descriptions to the problems are either vague or rambling. Too much emphasis is placed on advanced mathmatics rather than actual problem solving. All-in-all, the calendar lacks any sense of humor and fun. It could easily double as a math textbook."
2,Misleading shipping pricing / service,"The product seems to be just fine. However, I ordered it 9 days ago using 2-day shipping (costing ~$12), and it just arrived today. Apparently their 2-day shipping is USPS's priority mail, which is NOT 2-day, but instead 2-3 day (with no guarentee that it will in fact arrive in that much time). BTW, USPS doesn't charge $12 for priority mail (try $5)."
1,Horrible,Bought it because I thought it would be cool to watch. Never seen a boring Imax but this is the exception. I am a pilot and thats why I thought it would be cool but its mostly a stupid story line and about 30 seconds of not very exciting flying. watching flying clips on youtube is more fun.
5,"I love my cat, but I do not want to look like a cat lady","These pet hair lint brushes are really substantial, they pick up a lot more (both in terms of amount per sheet and how much they get off of surfaces) than other cheaper lint brushes and do not make that annoying squeak as they roll."
2,Limited usefulness,"I use this book a lot to give my customers a rough idea of what period costumes look like. If someone wants a costume from me, but don't really know what it is they are looking for I hand them this book so they can scan through the periods and find a general idea of what they want. Good for ideas for LARP costumes( but get a book with patterns too)."
3,"Limited, but good","I have to disagree with some of the harsher reviews of this book. Well one is of course limited by covering 900 years of clothing history in 130 pages, this book does the job as a starting point and is a great ""quick reference"" for costumers. It includes a section on ""further reading"" that contains over 50 books, some of them excellent, and it is annotated so one without a huge collection knows what to expect from some of the included books. Yes, each group of years is limited by including only 4 looks per gender, but it gives a good idea of the look of a particular era without expending too much money on a huge collection of books. Though, if you find yourself enamored of a particular era, you should seek out more complete works on that time. Overall, it's a go to book in my collection when I need to quickly get into a time period for which I don't have a large number of resources."
1,Worthless for Legitimate Costuming Reference,"John Peacock's books are all over the place, and it is such a shame. Any costume design or history class will teach you that for correct research, you need original sources, and unfortunately, this book has none. Personal interpretations carry with them the style of the period within which they were drawn, as well as the artist's own slant, and this is especially true in the works of John Peacock. With the vast amount of bad costuming found in theatres and some films, I hate to see how often this book is lauded as a great source and looked to for advice. Costume and Fashion: A Concise History by James Laver is a much better choice. Take the words of other reviewers and myself into consideration - if you are looking for valuable information, look somewhere else!"
1,WARNING: This is the tv series NOT the 3 OVA episodes!!!!,"Don't get confused like I did! I bought it from amazon thinking that it was the 3 ova episodes but it was the tv series. The dvd covers of the tv series and the OVAs are the same in amazon but actually they are different, so be sure to understand when you buy this, is the one you want.This is the sequel to the OVA episodes and it SUCKED!!!! Poor production, graphics, story and animation. The OVA episodes were even MUCH BETTER with HIGH quality production, good animation, good graphics and CUTE story.P.S: Buy the OVA episodes instead and pretend that this never existed.Adios."
1,WARNING: STAY AWAY!!!!!!,"If you love your cat, DO NOT get them this toy. These toys are dangerous. My cat loved the toy, but the string mouse unraveled and found it's way into his mouth and intestines. In short, it mangled up his insides and I had to put him down this week.They shouldn't be selling toys like this that can be fatal to the pets!!!!!"
2,Save your money,"Luckily, I only borrowed this video. You can do 10, 20, 30 or 40 minutes, but they do not explain the moves at all or give you time to learn them before jumping right into it. When you work out for even the 10 minutes, they play the same moves on a loop...boring! Also, It's hard to exercise with you're feeling really annoyed by the instructor who cannot lead. Find another video!"
3,Decent cardio workout led by a man,"If you are a man like me who wants a fair quality or reasonably decent workout led by a man, this video does the job. The 2 cardio portions are led by a man while the yoga, a woman. When I have this DVD on, I am NOT embarrassed if my neighbors hear the voice of a man leading the workout that I am doing inside my apartment. As a man in an Asian society, this is important for my social well being. I do workout to Bob Harper, Leslie Sansone, Chris Freytag, and Michael Carson's videos, too. For the female-led DVD's, I lower the volume.If you are a man and know of any good videos led by male trainers, share them with me."
4,just hooked it up,don't have anything on this yet . hoping it will last as long as they say it is charging a 300 yard fence
2,average flashlight,This light is not as bright nor works as well as a 3-D LED LIGHT. Very disappointed with the Maglite. I have one of the original 5 cell D lites and wont get rid of it. Why is the 3-D brighter thazn the 4-D lite.??????????
5,Better Than Expected,"I bought this to search a treeline at 100 meters from my house at night. I was expecting to only see relections of animal eyes at that distance. However, the beam is wide enough and strong enough to identify the type of animal lurking in the treeline. Very useful to know what's out there before venturing out with my dog at night. It seems to be a very well made flashlight. I'm using Ray-O-Vac alkaline batteries and don't know if that matters for brightness."
4,Awesome flashlight,"This is an awesome flashlight. The new LED bulb is much brighter than the standard krypton bulb, and as always the Maglite brand is trustworthy and durable. THe 4 cell batteries is a bit large, but the battery life and strength is well worth it."
5,Solid flash light,"The lights impressive for an LED.obviously should warn you that this is a huge flashlight and quite heavy due to the 4 D cell batteries it requires, but considering it can double as a nightstick, its worth it."
5,4 d led maglight,I bought this at a awesome price. Works great. Very bright and battery life is extremely good.
5,excellent,"Grat product, excellent service and price. However you should if used a smaller box to ship it. To much wast."
4,It's a mag lite,Not really much to say about this. It's a maglite. It's huge. It's decently bright; just wish they made these brighter these days. Especially in this size.
4,Puts a lot of light on the subject,"Case is lightweight with no batteries. After you put the 4 ""D"" cells in, it is satisfactorally heavy. Could be used as a nightstick or to fend off wild animals.The push on/off switch is rubber guarded and easy to use.Whenever you use the outer lens ring to expand the beam, it leaves a dark spot in the center where there is no light. I downgraded it one star because of this.I comes with an extra bulb that is stored in the flashlight body.I would anticipate the LED bulb will last a very long time.Be aware that department stores sell a similar model that has only a standard bulb. The LED model puts out more light with less battery drain. The light is bluish-white on the LED model."
5,4D monster Mag,"It's substantial. It's solid. And it's bright as heck. The 4D LED Maglite isn't pocket sized, but tuck it under the seat of your car or get yourself the mounting brackets, and you've got a handy, superbright flashlight that is super-easy on batteries. The 3W LED capsule is exceptionally bright and focused (and the adjustable beam goes from flood to spot, although the LED doesn't seem to get as broad as the standard bulb Mags do). There's an incandescent bulb in the tailpiece-- I guess it's there in case there should be an unlikely failure of the LED module.It's a little pricey and a lot long, but it's worth it on both counts. You never know when you're going to need beat a rabid raccoon or something."
1,Maglight 4D LED Flashlight,"To say I'm disappointed is an understatement! I have many LED flashlights, from many differant makers. All of them are better than the Maglight, even there own AA version. As the second reviewer stated, there is a huge black hole in the beem, with exception of the tightest setting on the focus! I am going to try and send it back, but since it was bubble packed, and I opened it and put batteries in to check it out, I don't know if I will be able to? I should have paid more attention to the reviews, as the second one I read stated this very thing! Live, be stupid, and learn. I can't even say I didn't know, because I read the reviews. I decided to try it because almost all the other reviews never mentioned it. I guess it must not have mattered the majority of those buyers? But it certainly does to me!"
5,Great Children's Book,Again I loved the book and enjoyed Mark Lowry reading in the DVD. I have 3 of his books and another one is on one of the Gaither DVD's. I recommend it to all parents. The kids at my church loved it too. It completely surprises me that I have not found them in a Christian book store.
1,My Review Of Virgin Territory,"Virgin Territory is a pathetic sex comedy that takes place in 14th century Italy, where a young loverboy(Hayden Christensen)goes around and sleeping with every woman he sees, then he is enamored by a lovely princess(Mischa Barton)and is destined to make her his soulmate, but he has to get through a murderous count(Tim Roth). The sex scenes was pale and unarousing and the plot lines was dowright horrendous. The special features failed to make this DVD enjoyable to watch. If you looking for a good sex comedy, stick with Animal House or American Pie and DON'T waste your money with this dreck!"
5,Essential Floyd Cramer,Brings back old memories and was just what I wanted. Thanks. Any Floyd Cramer lover will need this one in their play list.
5,the essentials floyd cramer,my wife likes the CD along time ago we listened to last date at skating rinkbrings back lots of memories rufus
2,Fiction,"This movie is based on real life story, but does not tell the real story. The whale was killed by a tug boat because he was not allowed the chance to reunite with his family. The bad guys in this story actually are the ones that were able to reunite Springer (another orphaned killer whale) back to her pod, where she is still happy and healthy today. Luna died a needless death due to an agenda that did not put what was best for this whale first."
4,The human dimension of the technology enabled workplace,"A practical, example rich book focused on the often overlooked human side of the .com revolution. The inhibiting factor in achieving great gains with technology is often cultural. This important element is overlooked in most corporate technology planning. I found this book to be a straightforward, practical guide on how to consider and integrate the critical human and cultural elements."
5,Great book!!!,"This book has given me much needed insight about the church office of Elder. I now know what God expects of me, and I feel more prepared to serve my church and my Pastor. I think all churches can benefit from church leaders who fully understand what their role is in God's church. A congregation suffers when it's leaders don't know how to serve them. This book should be a must read for all God called church Elders and Leaders!"
2,Scholarly Ramblings,"This is a difficult book to evaluate. Its author is obviously a bright scholar, and the book itself comes from an invited memorial lecture at the Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in 1989. There is lots of good material here about 2nd Century Christian beliefs, and quotations from many sources that can be hard to track down.BUT, it is difficult to know what the author is up to. There is no apparent structure nor theme. He seems to jump from one topic to another with no segue. Each pericope is perfectly good by itself, but there is no cumulative effect. Even more problematic, the documentation is poor and the bibliography is incomplete.This book may have made a very good lecture, but it doesn't survive as a meaningful book. Nonetheless the material herein is very valuable and the book may be of interest to scholars of early Christianity who are interested in the works of Marcion, Valentinus, Ignatius, Irenaeus, etc."
5,Buy it !,"One of the best books you'll ever read, an inspiring story, I wish he would write a follow up 20 years later. You'll read this in 24 hours, you won't want to put it down"
2,Were the authors paid by the word?,"This thick book contains a good mix and great deal of information, but the writing style is terrible. At every step, the authors go to great lengths to use the most verbose and indulgent language possible. Cut all the fluffy verbiage out and you would have a considerably clearer book that contains 100% of the information in far fewer pages.I would love to have the time to actually sit down and read this book properly. But a surgery clerkship simply does not afford enough time for that - there are simply not enough hours available when you work 15-17 hour days and were also hoping to eat and sleep. I cannot imagine why some clerkship directors feel that students should read this book. The only saving grace is that there are some 600 practice questions available on the publisher's website that you can access with the scratch-off code included inside the front cover."
3,Limited and too too General,"Although Essentials of General Surgery has a place. It is just that ""GENERAL"". It has limited info about specifics related to procedures. See review titled MUSHY posted by another reviewer. ""Essentials of Surgical Specialties"" is much more detail oriented."
2,Not appropriate for clerkship,"This book has a lot of good information, but with the extremely limited time available during surgery clerkship it is too dense to use as a study guide. Even if you are interested in doing surgery I think there would be a better more comprehensive textbook that you could buy to continue to use after clerkship. In 10 weeks I probably opened this book 5 or 6 times."
4,a good book to help you understand,"This book is very well written and easy to understand. It does not go in great depth, but help to understand surgery."
3,"Book is ok, very hard to read",Hard to read this over the course of a general surgery rotation due to bulk. All in all a decent book to just look up certain things that i have questions on.
3,Solid,"This book can be read in a short time and give sufficient knowledge base for surgery clerkship. With that said, I did not like the format of the book as I felt it was too bland. This could be however a result of all the high yeild/bullet format books out on the market that I might be used to. I recommend reading only a select chapters in this book."
4,Essentials of General Surgery,"My son is a doctor in his 2nd year Residency in General Surgery at one of the leading hospitals in NJ. I bought this book a while ago,while he was still attending medical school- To put in his own words the book was well presented -very informative and rewarding. He did well using this book and I will recommend to others."
4,CAD/CAM and other high tech methods,"The Handbook is ideal for a machinist, mechanical engineer or anyone else who makes a living in metalworking. It concisely spans the field. Straightforwardly written. Many topics are explained. From common sheet metal practices to the latest machine tools.Technology also figures prominently elsewhere in the book. There is a chapter on computer aided design and manufacturing. It explains the essence of software packages in this arena. With tables of CAD providers, and vendors who offer extensive component libraries. While you could certainly use a CAD package to design your own custom parts, it may be more cost effective to see if an existing library has what you need.Another chapter covers solid freeform production. Using methods like electron beam melting or selective laser sintering. Or 3D printing, where a solid part is catalysed out of a special liquid. All this might sound exotic to some of you. But it's worthwhile to keep informed of such techniques."
3,After the Crash/Northwest Flight 255,"If you are looking for a dissection of the Flight 255 accident, this is not the book you want. ""After the Crash,"" deals with the loss of a loved one, and examines the process' involved with sudden loss. There is a very small amount on the actual factors surrounding the accident. This is a very good book, if you are dealing with the loss/grief emotions, or studying that area. But, as an accident investigation recap, this is not it."
3,sperm & blood,"This book is about a lot of gang fights with blood and a lot of good f***ing between men and women, men and men and so on... The whole story is based on different street politic movenents that struggle for power. The movements themselves are very absurd, like ultimate feminist organization lead by a man. :) There are a lot of ironic and funny moments, but as a whole from a moment on the plot seems to get boring for me. However occasional good moments are present to the very end, like one very crazy lunatic LSD trip being described. If you like very vulgar language and brutal stories, not brigning some directly serious message - this one's for you. There some politic stuff there too."
4,Works great for the price!,"This is the second pair I've purchased. I lost my other ones, but for the price, easily replaced. I use them with my Tamrac Adventure 7 pack. I love them, but I do wish there was a way so they wouldn't hang. I don't know if this is possible with any straps, so it's definitely not a deterrent. I would highly recommend them."
2,What good are these?,"These are great straps, they are strong, they easily lock close and open with one hand, but when paired with the Tamrac 9 adventure pack you'll find no where on the pack to attached these straps to secure your tripod. I'm surprised after ten days in Europe and countless times they came loose I didn't lose one but I left with four straps and came home with four straps."
4,Silky enticing vocals. Listen or dance to this music.,Catchy rhythms and melodious lines. Original and sure to cross over. Any serious collector of latin music will want to own this CD. I believe this group did backup for Roberto Carlos.
4,Gostei,I just got back from Minas Gerais and it was good to see the a local band has done so well in the music industry.
5,It is very good .,"I love it very much , but would like to hear it in portuguese before buy it , also I'm looking for artist in the same field like Zeca pagodinho weach is the greast in pagode , So pra Contrariar, Negritude junior and all the pagodes grupos the are in sucess in Brasil."
4,good addition to rescue hero collection,"My son just turned four, and this is his favorite toy from his birthday. He loves rescue heros, and I think the smaller version is easier for him the play with (given his little hands). I wish the sub didn't have a big hole in the side (supposed to be crashed) and then they could use their own imagination for scenarios using the sub, but it doesn't seem to stop him. FYI, it goes in real water just fine, because he always wants it in the pool or tub."
5,Best book ever!,"This book has not only changed my life but some of my clients lives too. As a social worker, I find the information in the book very informative and helpful in assisting people in learning to be happy. I have bought many copies to give to clients, friends and family. Highly recommended!"
5,I have benefited from this book like no other I've read.,"Easy to read,absolutely full of great advice and food for thought. I actually went back a second and third time and highlighted parts relevant to me. I cannot recommend this enough for people who truly want to change the way they think about everyday situations and turn their world into a happier one, simply by adjusting their thought patterns. (Patterns you don't realise you have). It's not heavy and there are no rediculous 'exercises'... it's all good fun and provides great benefits.. I think he's a great author and have bought all 3 of his books."
3,Good,"This is a good 'self help' book. Very simple, lucid and practical. You can identify with the examples and options that the author offers to catch up with the elusive happiness!!"
4,being happy,"What can I possibly add to this books many, glowing, reviews? It teaches its readers to harnass the positive elements of life, rather than waste any time wallolwing in self pity. There are real negative forces in the world, just waiting to drag one down.Each chapter is concise and filled with humourous cartoons; easy to comprehend and practical in their application. Besides, they appeal to the child in every one!The clear message is to be happy in all circumstances. I count this as being, ""joyful"", as a Christian. After all, isn't it well said and true that ""Life is not a dress rehearsal"".By Elizabeth Laine, author of, ""A Butterfly Landed an Eagle""."
5,Wonderful book!,"So easy to read and read all over again. Every chapter at the end has a review titled ""In a nut shell"". I read those very often."
5,Wonderfully Helpful,"I am greatful that a co-worker recommended this book to me when she did. I was at a very low point in my life, and was probably close to making a rash decision that I would regret later. This book has taught me that I am not defective, and that I have more control over me and the events in my life than I thought. To some this book may be a rude awakening, but it is an awakening well worth it. I would recommend it to everyone, not just those at a low-point in their lives. I know this is a book I will be reading again and again, and each time I will take something else away with me as a lesson learned."
5,Cute and entertaining,"I make books like these a toilet read.Don't get me wrong, I'm not giving it a critical review.What I meant to say is that if you have only 5 minutes to sit and read something loosen your mind, muscles and *muted*, this is a good book to hang by the bowl..."
1,Being Happy by Andrew Matthews,Light hearted and easy to read (but must then be put into practice) directions to navigate a happy life.
5,"Wonderful, uplifting book!","I can't recommend this book enough. It lifted my spirit and made me see the world around me in a new light. It's an easy read for both young and old. If you know someone who is stressed, depressed, or just in a bit of a slump, purchase this book for them. They'll thank you for it"
3,You wont find your happiness in this book,Cute pictures and some great quotes. But like a parent scolding a child. This book tells you flat out if you are not happy it is YOUR OWN FAULT.
5,Share my experience,"In here, I want to share my experience to anybody who really want to know about ourselves. I don't want to explain too much about how I like this book, I bought about 6 of this book, not just for myself, and I also gave to my brother, sister and friends. This book is really, really helpful. After reading this, you will also like to read another book by the Andrew Matthews."
2,average self-help guide,"Although I am an American, I found this book to be a simplistic and entertaining guide for the American masses seeking self help advice from eye catching and easy to read books/manuals. But I say, ""more power to 'em,"" for the individuals that have found solace and information from this guide that has led to an improvement in their lives! I have two reservations pertaining to the content of the guide. The first is the absence of scientific data to support the author's theories. Second is the reoccurring theme that positive thoughts can become your reality. Social and government structures throughout the world can make this difficult or impossible for the most positive mind and productive body to succeed. In addition, believing in something enough to make it reality for you does not always lead to a favorable outcome."
1,"He has interesting points, but....","Being Happy is a good title for this book, for if you are happy, the book explains why you are happy. If you are not happy, this book won't make you happy although it might make you laugh, or even sad as it did me. He explains my unhappiness. He tends to blame the reader for their own unhappiness. YOU have to choose to be happy and you are only as happy as you set out to be.Ok, that certainly helped, I will just run out at be happy the rest of my life with that well informed advice. I think the author has no clue why some are unhappy and tends to think they should all just snap out of it."
3,Acceptable...needs improvement...,"It is a ""so-so"" book and the organisation may be a little messy... but the redeeming factors may well be that the book is full of really cute cartoons and there are a lot of simple instances for all readers to understand easily... Again, I say it's acceptable and i recommend readers to buy ""Follow Your Heart"" as it is better in my opinion..."
5,This Book Is All You Need!!,"I have read a fair few self-help books to try and overcome low self confidence and depression and i have found practically all of the ideas that i have encountered thus far in this book!Matthews writes in a very entertaining and simple style. The book is structured in a way that builds you up-and-into the life that you deserve; first by controlling the mind and then by pursuing what it is that will make you happy.What i like most about this book is it's simplicity; it contains lots of tips and information, more-so than most books in this genre, and yet nothing is heavy, it is all made so simple, like you are recieving advice in conversation with the worldly wise.It is also peppered with inspirational quotes which gives it incredible motivational power.BUY IT!!"
4,An easy understand & funny book for your friends,"I find this book in Hong Kong book shop. I was attracted by it's lovely cartoon & simple english, since I am a Chinese. After reading, I decide to buy one more to my best friend who study alone in the UK. I hope she will ""Being Happy""."
4,GREAT!!!!!,This is so good..... But its only in japanese not dubbed in english.Theres eps 23-43 in the boxset. Contains the final 21episodes in the series..
3,Pretty and functional,Satisfied with the product although now I wish I'd bought plain rather than such a busy pattern. But that's just personal preference. The plates themselves are very nice.
2,No Excuse for Being So Ignorant,"Straczynski shows how ignorant he is. In his book, he talked about how America car companies were relocating to Singapore because Singapore's wages were so dirt cheap. He mistakes Singapore for China. A simple check on CIA's factbook would tell him that is not true. A pity as I do like Straczynski's books but this level of ignorance and probably laziness is just unforgiveable.The premise of his story was a nice hook. However, the position where his protagonist faces towards the finale of the book sounds strangely similar to the same predicament the human protagonist faced in the Babylon 5 Vorlon-Shadow war. Additionally, the choice made by the protagonist in this book was very similar to the choice made by the protagonist in the Babylon 5 Vorlon-Shadow war conclusion. This just felt reharshed and lazy.The one good thing about this book is the art though. Consistent throughout the book. Nicely colored and well drawn."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A good start, then so-so, but definitely did not see what was coming on the end, improving a lot as it went on, with the various angelic revelations. With the strong start, then drop, I did not continue getting the single issue, but I am happy to have read the completed collection when it was all finally brought together, as it was not what I expected."
5,Hot and sexy,"This book is remarkable for what it has - high class writing that is totally down and dirty, yet it's full of passion and emotion and lust and craving. Some of the less dirty stories are very powerful, with nothing more than the truth of submission to them. Great book, highly recommended."
3,Point of view is important,"I read only one story in this book and scanned the rest. It appears to be well-written and basically fits the descriptions given by other reviewers. However, no one seems to make clear that these are stories about male dominance of women. Being of the opposite nature, these stories are more of a turn-off for me than a turn-on. It's not a reflection on their quality. They do have a woman's perspective and seem to be more generally subtle than similar stories by a male author might be. However, for stories on dominance written by a woman, I much prefer the collection by Tammy Jo Eckhart, Justice and Other Short Erotic Tales, where the woman is on top."
3,Well better than average set of shorts,I gave this 3 stars as it is better than average for the genre.This collection of short stories has a few that miss and some that are just plain wierd-but by and large they are well written and erotic. The problem I ave here is common to most short stories-you either have character devolopment or you have a plot but generaly not both.
2,did not clearly explain,not a very clear book. talks more of various tantra to satisfy goddess. it could have done better had it talked about how these tantras have worked on its performers and its repercussions. i will not recomend the book to anyone who it looking for insight knowledge about yoni tantra. its more of a sketch...a briefing....an outline....but very unclear.
2,Overall A below average Collection,"John Byrne has done some excellent work in his time as a writer artist, this is not one of those times. His art is excellent, but the story is well below average. Except for the introduction of Wonder Girl (Who had to rely on a reboot by Peter David & Geoff Johns to become a true character) there is nothing of distinction in this collection. I know the character well and unlike the Wonder Woman/Artemis storyline or any of Rucka's work, Byrne just doesn't seem to truly understand the character."
3,Tiny Tiny Bag!,Not bad if your camera is extra small. Didn't fit my Lumix which I consider to be pretty small. Overall not a bad looking bag but beware of the size.
5,A Marvel of a Memoir,"At first glance, this is a messed-up book about a messed-up person. Oh yes, and he intends to tell us about the Scopes-Monkey Trial. He does. He also tells us about his life and about the lives of his ancestors, descendants of the one and only Charles Darwin. The form is unusual, but it works, works far better than if Chapman had tried to write a book on any one topic. With his odd form, Chapman contextualizes Dayton, Tennessee, his reactions to it, his life, his family history and the evolution debate all with respect to one another. Though the details get as embarrassing as Rousseau (or today's average tell-all), Chapman is above all a modern version of Montaigne, telling us about something very different from himself - the Scopes-Monkey Trial - but telling us about himself in the process. (For those who don't like Montaigne, the quirks are there but this is lighter reading.) A marvelous book."
3,Worth it.,"Like other reviewers claimed, they are rather small but that's how they're portrayed in the anime/manga. Unfortunately they are yellow (instead of orange) which I can only assume is easier to tint than orange.Overall if I didn't love the series as much as I do this wouldn't be worth $47 I paid."
4,A decent collectors piece,These are pretty nice glasses as far as construction and accuracy to the show go. I have no real complaints.
2,Not for me,"I generally wear a 6.5 or 7 in shoes. I ordered these in a size 7 and they were way too big. I didn't exchange them because they are also wayyyyyy too flat, had no arch (unlike my other flats), lacked any type of cushioning whatsoever, and look almost cartoony in person. Sorry to offend those who might like or even own them, but these shoes were definitely not for me."
1,This toy isn't what you say it is!!,"I bought the spy vision scope with my birthday money. I thought it would be cool, but it didn't work the way it is supposed to, so I wasted my money!I don't recommend this for younger kids, because there's no instructions except on the box. Also not for people with long hair, because it gets tangled in hair really easy.I hope this toy can be improved in the future. Thank you for letting me speak my mind."
5,AWSOME!!!!!!!,"This toy is the bomb. I am 11 years old and this is one of my favorite spy gadgets. I collect spy gadgets and this is deffenetly one of my favorites. The reason I put only for stars in fun is because it is alitle tight but if you work on it you can get it to feel OK. The telescope is realy cool because you can just slide it back into place when your running becouse it flops all around. You can realy see clearer farther away whith it too. The light is not that bright but it is good to shine on one thing if it is dark. It does not shine all around like a regular flashlight it just shines were it is pointed. The compleate set I recomend is this, the Spy Pen, and the Tool belt or the micro set. I totaly recamend this toy!"
1,not very good,"I got this for a present on my birthday. IT STINKS! This toy was so boring, and it doesn't even really work. There is a headset thing and you put it on to see things clearer. There is a pop-out magnifying glass thing, and it is just like a regular one. It is supposed to magnify things from far away, but it doesn't at all! I could look over at the thing i was magnifying and it looks as close as the magnifyer made it! It doesn't work at all! If anyone wants to get this, I recomend you don't, bcause you will probably play with it for about two days, like i did."
5,"One of those ""must haves""","Doug Hall does one great job of giving you theory and practical application together in an easily understood form. This is the type of ""how-to"" that you can be easily implemented."
3,"Tried and true ideas, reasonably well presented.","The book is full of marketing truisms that are presented better elsewhere, but set forth here as if they were new discoveries. For example, ""benefits sell more than features."" Well, duh! You already know this if you have read a single introductory marketing text. That said, the book's positive point is the energy with which he conveys the information, and it is a reasonably engaging read. The negative point is the ego of the author rises to the level of distraction.So what's with all the glib five star reviews this book has received? Was I missing the point, was I reading a different book, or were there a few reviews planted by the publisher?"
1,What a disappointment,"I buy about a book a week from Amazon and never write reviews - but I have to on this one.Did you buy one of the original Apple Ipods? All the PR and reviews got your expectations up - only to find out that they went cheap on the battery. It lasts about 3-minutes. Big disappointment. It was capable of so much more.Same with this book. I LOVED Hall's first book. Great breakthrough stuff. So when this one was released I got in the pre-publication line. I saved the book for a Saturday cross-country plane ride ready to savor. Had the highlighter all ready and - bummer. Couldn't believe it.It's the equivlant of ""Eat plenty of vegetables, get plenty of sleep and brush your teeth every day."" Mundane, sophormoric stuff to be associated with the name Doug Hall. Not at all in the same league as his first book - a masterpiece. This guy is so much better than this cute little book of lists. I'll buy his next one, pay money to go see him - but this isn't the Doug Hall of the first book."
5,A 'Scary Good' book,"This book will make you very uncomfortable, and I highly recommend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK unless you are prepared to act...Doug Hall has put together a 'no holds barred' look at very simple rules for maximizing product (and service) success in the market, complete with annoyingly accurate data to back up every claim.The only problem is that it strips away the excuses we all hold dear for doing things the way we've always done them...or not doing them at all...and the lessons Doug teaches only work if you do."
5,Be Bold... Buy This Book!,"Not only have I read the book, but I had the pleasure of hearing Doug speak last night. He is on fire! His messages about business are straight forward and simple. He has no really revolutionary insights, however he speaks plainly and directly to the reader. The real ah ha, the genius of his work is something called Merwyn. Named for his Dad. Merwyn brings science to the art of new product development. When you buy the book you get to have one of your business ideas scanned! Merwyn works to help you understand the probability of success of your idea. It quantifies success. Doug signed my book ""Be Bold."" I encourage you to be bold and buy his book!"
5,"Fresh, Insightful and Practical","If you're tired of 1) the same old trite ideas on business success and/or 2) books lacking any quantifiable basis or proof, then you'll really enjoy Jump Start Your Business Brain! Doug Hall has a long and proven track record of successul innovation consulting with some of America's biggest and best companies. What makes him even more unique is his ability to distill what works, why and how to do it into understandable concepts. This book is full of both anecdotes and analysis. You won't have to take Doug's word for it; the data provides exceptional credibility. As someone who read approximately 100 business books a year, this is definitely one of my favorites."
1,What a waste of money!,"I bought this product about 3 months ago looking for impressive ways to persue the never ending quest to be the badded mofo of FPS shooters. Turns out that this thing is a hunk of junk! It's really hard to get it the glove movement to coorespond with the game or mouse in windows, it isn't comfortable for people with big hands like myself, and it is difficult to use in any type of light. Like the previous person that wrote a review, my p5 glove has been sitting on the shelf in my closet. I played around with it for 2 weeks to get it to work the way they advertised it. It just isn't worth the money! Buy a Nostromo N50 instead!"
3,Generally Good,"Excellent idea. Quality quite high. Unfortunately, there's no leftie! That docks at least two stars."
2,"Nice idea, bad follow-through","I first saw this item advertised on late night paid programming. It looked as if it would take all the games I play to another dimension. I was wrong... It works exactly like it says, but I didn't take into consideration the IR receptor has to be if front of you monitor to get your hand motions correct. Oh yeah, did I mention the huge IR receptor? You might find it entertaining to use it in a flight sim, but this device is overally complicated when it comes to shooters. Doesn't work well with windows 7, or most any modern game available. I love the feel of it on your hand... it makes you look like a serious gamer. However, after a few minutes of holding you had up... you realize the importance of a laser mouse and keyboard. I'm gonna wait till they make digital contacts you can control the mouse pointer with before I invest in anymore virtual reality hardware."
4,Temp review,"I haven't gotten this yet, I just ordered it this morning, so I'll edit this if I have to. I did some research on this item. Most of the reviewers here that are negative are mostly using this item for FPS GAMES. What appears to me, is, that this isn't JUST for games, but for other things, like, 3d modelling, music creation, animation, etc. I'll be using it for all these once I get my hands on it ( literally, lol ). Of course I'm going to try it for games as well.The other thing about the reviewer that said something about that it's slow to respond interactions...Perhaps maybe its your modem? 56k perhaps?"
4,Bible series,"3 of the 4 videos are extremely informative. However, the Genesis video was of no value to me."
4,The Bible Series Box Set,I think that everyone should get this Bible Series Box Set. It's great for a family night.... Also it helps you to understand the bible.
4,"""What A Movie""","Ben Cross plays a wonderful and powerful part as ""Solomon"" which you will find it all, rebellion, corruption, courage, and faith. Like his father ""King David"" he got off to a good start but like his father he had a weakness for women that undid him,this in turn, led him away from ""God"". ""Solomon's"" beginning was better than his ending he had been raised to greatness, but plunged into the abyss of moral degradation and idolatry. I found that the love affair with ""Qween Sheba"" was not in accordance with scripture. The biblical text account of Sheba's visit was apparently a trade mission and to test Solomon's wisdom. All in all it is rich in history, drama, suffering, and death, and sets the stage for the rest of the Old Testament. It is well worth watching, I found it riviting and so sad at the same time."
2,pre-owned and nasty,"Had nasty crusty finger prints on dvd's I almost sent it back! I remembered it was used, and still was disapointed that it would be sent so nasty!"
1,The Bible Series,"""R"" is the proper rating, less for violence than sheer intensity.I would not want children under 9 to watch this due to the rawness with which it confronts desolation and mortality."
2,Solomon,Question: Why is it that there are always non-Jewish actors playing the title roles in movies about the Bible? Max von Sydow would be more believable playing Raoul Wallenberg or somebody.
5,Beautiful set,Esther and Jeremiah are wonderful. I've enjoyed every minute of these movies. They are made very close to the Bible. A MUST BUY!
4,Bible Series Set of 4,I am impressed! I found the Bible stories quite accurate. The filiming locations gave authenticity while the actors were believable.
4,Biblical movies,"Great series of movies although the first one, Genesis is very slow and almost put me to sleep. Follows the Bible well"
3,Very good set to have!,"I definitely recommend this Bible set series. Genesis is a little slow but great for children to understand the creation. Esther, Jeremiah, and Solomon are all very detailed about what events actually took place. Thumbs up!"
3,Bible Series,"This is good to understand the historical background of Old Testment, especially with educational purpose."
3,Solomon the Movie: More than Just the Bible Account,"Since I was looking for a scriptural account of Solomon, this version of Solomon was disappointing for me. Many interpretations of Solomon were thrown together to create the movie. As an example, the relationship with the Queen of Sheba was long and drawn out in the movie and was what I believe to be based on the Ethiopian and Eritrean account of Makeda, not the Bible account of Solomon's encounter with the Queen. As a movie it was good, but not a scriptural representation."
5,"Genius,,,","I hope I am not being blasphemous, but this CD can best be summed up by modifying Valerie Simpson's own lyrics from the gospel song that closes this album: ""She's a genius, a genius. She's a genius, isn't she?""What a set of tracks! For those who like this genre, this stuff is solid gold soul music, whether it was on the hit charts or not. This woman should have been a mega solo star. Luckily Valerie Simpson was able to find fame in ""Ashford & Simpson"" anyway, but this music shows she deserved it long before."
3,Disappointing,"Mr. Johnston has an execllent voice, he should have just read the Bible with out the voice effects and background music. The volume of the background music changed often and is at times quite distracting."
1,There are better productions...,"I must be the only dissenting voice anywhere regarding the production of this audio version of scripture. I don't dispute that Mr. Johnston has a beautiful voice. However, I find that the production of this recording is very poor. It is narrated too fast, with hardly a breath between verses, chapters and books. I doubt this is how Mr. Johnston actually read it, but rather an editing room issue. A previous reviewer eluded to some editing splices where errors were corrected with voice overs. The number and quality of voice overs is distracting. Some of the voice overs are obviously not even Mr. Johnston. Additionally, the background music, in my opinion is obtrusive. At points, the music is distracting. In the early part of the book of Psalms for example, the music shifts from quiet and serene, to climactic concert pieces. I found myself almost paying attention more to the music, trying to guess the piece.All in all, I would not recommend this version."
5,The beauty of the KJV and a beautiful narration,If you want to understand the KJV and still find the poetic magic of the English translation the NKJV is for you. Wonderful narration by Mr. Stephen Johnston
5,Bravo Mr. Johnston!,"The perfect spiritual companion when unable to read my Bible firsthand. Powerful, forceful narration, outstanding music and characters help infuse God's eternal Word in my heart and mind."
5,A good resource for role-players,"Karak Azgal is a sourcebook for the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay game's Second Edition, detailing a dwarf-run city in the mountains. It combines adventure hooks aboveground in the city built over the ruins of the dragon-destroyed dwarf city, and in the underground passages below."
4,Worth owning,An interesting book even more so because it is published in English as most of the books on this subject are printed in German. A nice little volume that is unfortunately out of print. If you can find it buy it.Recommended.
1,Too many trick questions!!,"I started studying for my teaching exam with this book after using Praxis I: Ppst (Cliffs Test Prep Guides). The Cliff Guide was great, straight forward and had great explanations! This book, however, was very hard and tricky. After taking the Praxis, I can say that this book was nothing like the real test, too many of the questions tried to trick you, and the test is not like that at all! I do not reccomend this book!"
5,All Time Favorite,"These little cakes are so good with coffee and a real treat especially when frozen. They can be a little dry if eaten without a beverage, otherwise, but they are an all time favorite of mine since I was a little girl growing up in Brooklyn, NY. This company also used to put out little cream filled cakes called Yankee Doodles, but I don't think they are around anymore. I'm just glad Drake's was kind enough to keep one of them going and I'm glad I found a place where I could order them without bothering my sister in NY all the time.They're worth the try."
4,The Future Of Latin?,"Sidestepper, a project from producer Richard Blair, to fuse dance beats and funky latin grooves. This album works, latin is so funky its so cool, its beats are so shakin that this album is so good. You get the to get all the best bits from latin, and then band you hear a beat you hear in clubs.From the outset this album is just so chilled ice COOL, if you like latin, or you love the feel of the latin beat, of you are looking for a good time. GET THIS ALBUM!"
5,Very Detailed and Clear,"Rebecca does a great job of showing easy to follow, detailed, steps to gardening. She touches base with all the frequently asked questions. I have been gardening for years and wanted something to show my daughter, that would be fast. Rebecca keeps it very interesting as well and is very organized."
4,very good,"I really enjoyed this book. The reader feels at each page that the author is not only a scholar, but also a pasionnate man who can very well communicate his expertise.Un livre fort bien écrit, nourri de nombreux détails, dans lequel on ressent tout le respect de l'auteur pour la mystérieuse tradition des Cittars ou Siddhas tamouls."
2,A disappointment,"I purchased this for my wife for our anniversary. Although the songs from the Johnny's Greatest Hits album included on this compilation were good as always, the other were so-so at best. And, the sound quality overall on the MP3 download I purchased was lousy. I wish I could return it."
2,The Essential Johnny Mathis,"Love Johnny Mathis but this collection disappointed me.The first time I put the discs on (Christmas ~ New Year Holiday time) I did not listen all the way through,too boring.At a later date give it another chance & listened all the way through hoping for the pleasure of good music & not wanting to have wasted my money.There are a few songs that are great in the style & sound of the Johnny Mathis we all hope for, but not willing to listen again all the way through to get to the few good songs in~between the borring songs. Thegood songs are what I expected the entire two discs to consist of when I made the purchase."
3,Why all the mono?,"Nice selection of songs, but why are almost all of the early hits in mono? Some of these have been available in stereo before and for the remaining few, I hoped that they might remix them to stereo if the 2-track tapes still existed. Oh well..."
3,"So Much To Choose From, But There Are Songs Missing......","Johnny's recorded 100 plus albums in his career, a two disc set just can't summarize that much material; still, there are a few signature tunes missing. ""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me"" which warrented inclusion on the soundtrack but not the soundtrack album of ""To Wong Foo"" is rather a sore spot for me, I really want that song and the album is out of print. ""You Who Brought Me Love"" performed with Patti Austin and featured on the t.v. soap ""General Hospital"" was a huge A/C hit and by all rights should be here. It is nice that this collection is updated to include tracks from Johnny's career of late, all the way up to his Broadway album released in 2000. ""Sleigh Ride"" from one of the most successful Christmas albums ever, is included so a cut from his very last album, a Christmas album, was understandably skipped. Overall this isn't a bad collection, just not comprehensive enough."
5,Old School Cool!,"I received this product in excellent condition and in a timely manner with no problems. This was ""Old School Cool."""
4,I'm not a reviewer....,I hate writing reviews. I'm not a English major or a critic. I read for entertainment and I use the star system to show how much I liked something.
4,Solid Read,"This is the second book of Mr. Wilson's I read (loved The Chronoliths). I enjoyed this one a lot and found the characters interesting. I also liked the plot. I will admit I didn't fully understand or ""get"" the ending but that didn't stop me from really enjoying this book. Mr. Wilson is an engaging author. I will definitely keep reading his books."
2,"Good author, terrible publisher","A good read, spoiled by the quality of the (mass market paperback)printing. The publisher used so little paper that you almost couldn'tread the inside of many pages without breaking the spine of the book.I would recommend that the author find another publisher.rt"
2,"Great characters, great plot, lousy ending","With a Hugo nomination and a glowing review from my favorite Sf author, Rob Sawyer, to recommend it, this book looked like a sure-fire winner. I was quickly caught up in the characters and the plot, and I didn't want to put the book down! I wish I had. After about 350 pages of pure enjoyment, the book's ending is a Grade B filmmaker's delight that is not only farfetched but inconclusive, resolving the character issues but leaving the central SF question unclear.Wilson is a very talented writer, but he does not seem to be able to handle endings satisfactorily, as both this book and Chronoliths exemplify. If he could correct this weakness, Wilson could quickly become someone to buy in hardback!If you want to read some great Hugo-nominated SF by a Canadian writer, give this one a miss and pick up Sawyer's own Hominids, which won last year's Hugo, or its sequel, Humans, which is nominated this year."
4,"Intelligent, well written","The scientists in the Blind Lake research facility monitor life on another planet. Using technology they do not truly understand, they watch a being on a world fifty light years distant as it goes through its daily life. When the facility suddenly goes into a strict lockdown mode, things begin to change.This story centers on a scientist, her controlling, violent ex-husband, her troubled daughter and a boarder in her home.While none of Wilson's books are what I would call 'typical' science fiction, they are thoughtful,intelligent and interesting. In it, he examined the role of humanity among the stars, the way one culture interprets another and does a good job with the characters.While I did not consider this his best, I did enjoy reading this one."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I really enjoyed Spin and found the follow-up to that novel not as good but good. Based on those two books, I wanted to read something else by this writer. So I found this book at the library. It was slow reading, like slogging through something bland and wet. Hard to explain but I just didn't care for it. Maybe after a few books by the same ""guy"", you see he basically has one idea and he presents that same idea over and over in slightly different ways, beating the poor horse to death. Not sure. All I know is that I'm glad the experience of reading this book is over. I had to skim the last chapter or two and I just didn't care what happened at the end (hint: nothing happened).Roger"
2,Weak story,"Boring plot, bad end, good character description.Could be a good book if it wasn't sci-fi."
2,not very well done,"this wasn't the best written book that i've read. the descriptions were long and boring, and the character development was subpar. all in all i would find something else to read."
2,"liven it up a little, please!",I think I'm giving up wilson's books. His stories have no excitement whatsoever. His one is no different. Could have been a great story instead its a cure for insomnia.
4,"Plodding start, great ending","I nearly put the book down after 2 chapters. But I am glad I stuck with it. Only slightly futuristic, and while the underlying science is unlikely, the concepts are unusual and interesting. The character development is reasonable, and the book doesn't get buried in theory, but manages to tell the story well."
2,Below Expectations,The story of this book was very slow and not that exciting. Only positive of the book is that the science involved in the story was unique.
3,Solidly average.,"The story begins promisingly, with a mysterious alien race being observed from earth, 51 light years away, via a quantum computer network. The characters are enjoyable and interesting at first. The middle and ending portions of the book bog down considerably, with melodrama and ultimately uninteresting character interactions. The alien story sort of fizzles out, sadly like the book itself. Overall an average read."
4,A thought-provoking page turner,"Blind Lake has one of the most original themes I have read in hard science fiction in a long while. Superficially, Blind Lake is the story of a science facility, engaged in watching an extraterrestial civilization, that suddenly finds itself to be quarantined from the rest of the world. On a deeper level, Blind Lake shows that observation is never impartial. Being observed changes both the watcher and the subject. The book is suspenseful and comes to a very satisfying conclusion. I highly recommend it."
4,German Unit Divisional History,"I own this book, bought year 2000. This is a re-print of the original Podzun-Pallas Verlag edition. Lots of photo's of equipment and personnel, B&W;, no color except dustjacket. Includes a maps, Unit TO&E;'s, other material. Written by the vveterans of this unit for their fellows. German language with some english translations. As is typical of these books the translations sometimes leave much to be desired. A little German language skill helps, but really isn't necessary.At the time (1970's) these books were hard to obtain although many, like this one, are now available in re-print. I used them as reference for war-gaming and model kit building. Worth getting if you are a historian or book collector."
3,Beware 2nd Edition,"Treatment is at the right level for engineers and scientists interested in applying concepts without getting bogged down in the underlying mathematics. But beware: the promised code examples that added so much to the first edition, and which I expected when I purchased the second edition, are not in the book. Rather, an appendix refers the reader to a web site at Stanford that is no longer there. The author has died and emails to the publisher and the department at Stanford are unanswered. Had I known, I would have purchased a used copy of the first edition and saved the $100+."
4,A nice surprise,"Healing through fire is a very good record. Having never heard anything from orange goblin before i picked this up because of the positive things i read in metal magazines and i was pleasently surprised. I have heard orange goblin labled as a doom band and although that is close to me their songs sound more like jam sessions, that is the best way i can describe them. Highlights are the ballad of solomon eagle,vagrant stomp,the ale house braves,hounds ditch,they come back(harvest of skulls), and beginners guide to suicide."
3,"3,5 stars","This is a nice album generally. Im betwwen is just ok and i like it. Its not so good as Time travelling Blues whis is their best till this day and if you like stoner rock then this album is a must - yiu will definitely like it. This album has some good times (the first 3 songs and The song: They come back, are good songs and like them . Im not crazy about these songs but they are good. The other songs are too average - the just ok factor i was telling about. On the other way if you are a huge fan of then then by all means buy this album as with their first album are their best choices. If you are new start with Time Travelling blues -iM sure you will like this album."
3,Soothing Canadian Smooth Jazz!,"This CD was issued to me by a couple of established musicians in Canada looking for inroads into the U.S. Jazz scene. Lou Bartolomucci and Tony Carlucci's debut CD is a lively mix of Samba and Bossa Nova rhythms reminiscent of the Antonio Carlos Jobim songbook. A few tracks are suspect but still plausible. I wasn't too impressed with the track, ""Encatata"" as it seemed a bit dull and boring. However the rest of the CD is nice to listen to. I enjoyed the track, ""Early Mornin'"" with it's light Trumpet and latin rhythms. Overall, the CD is great for dinner and parties as well as laying around on a rainy afternoon or driving on a wine tour, a la Sideways. Good work!"
3,Great Sound,"I Love The Sound && All, It has GOOD Noise Cancellation. . .But The Bass Is Kinda Low, I Love Bass in My Headphones But I Like These Because The Good Sound && Comfort It has. . .In The Winter I Dnt have To Worry Bout ear Muffs. . .It has A Long Cord For Good Reach, Covers The Whole ear && The Sound Is Very Clear"
3,Good!,"Thanks, I like your product. It arrived on time and works well. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)"
4,Sounds Great !,These headphones sound great! I'm using them on my desktop pc I play games a lot and listen to music. They are actually lightweight and comfortable on my ears. I had been buying pair after pair of cheap headphones that would break or one side would quit working. I'm glad I bought these they seem very durable the top part that goes over your head feels a little cheap but the comfort on your ears and the sound quality make up for that.Pros: They sound great!! They are lightweight and comfortable! Great price ! Long cord.Cons: No volume control on them. I think they look dorky on me because the ear pieces are kind of bulky lol
2,almost good enough,completely piece of plastic with egg package style material in the part that touch your ears. the isolation is not perfect (and with the wind it could become impossible to listen the music). the cord is amazingly long. not good to attach in a mp3 player and walk around the town at all but good to stand up in your room with it plugged in the computer and give almost 4 steps.if i was in need of another earphone i was going to pick up something different and not this one.
2,Sound quality is disappointing.,"The Sony Outlet store had this on special for $12. What a steal I thought. The headset feels comfortable but the sound quality is not very impressive. For a headset this size, you'd expect to hear some sort of BASS. I'm taking it back to the store.I would have probably have kept this at the price, but given that they do not hold the sound well (too loud to use in the office cube), I won't find any use for it. I wasn't planning to write a review, but I read user review comparing the sound quality of this model to his $90 headset."
2,Broke pretty quickly,"mine broke after about 6 months the right side went out and i can't get it back, for a while whenever i turned my head the right side would go out halfway, they look nice, and they sound ok when they work correctly but, id try something else with stronger wires or something, i also bought a pair for my sister when i bought mine 6 months ago and she doesn't have her's anymore either but i dont know why..."
3,"MDR-XD100, poor sound, great construction.","With good construction this is a good buy. It's very light, but it's solid. The chord is heavy duty and extra long. The sound is sub-standard, but it can handle extreme volume. Most point to it's lack of bass, but bass is not all that the sound quality lacks. They're not good for portability, or use with portable media devices because of their long chord and a high draw of electrical current. The headphones sound their best (which is still bad) when you use them with a proper equalizer and amp (or a computer with a high-quality sound controller/card). But buying these because you have a high end sound card or expensive audio equipment is like buying a tailor with no wheels because you own a powerful truck that won't have a problem pulling it.You get what you pay for. Whereas most headphones invest most into the speakers and let the actual construction suffer, Sony did the exact opposite with this product."
3,You get what you pay for,"Inexpensive. Functional. Comfortable? I don't think I agree on that one, however I say that compared some expensive high end phones I own which are very comfortable.I purchased these to use with my HD video camera, so I could monitor the microphone while filming. For this purpose they work fine. Unlike some other Sony heaphones they do not fold up compactly. They are however much lighter than the other sony headphones I own. The cord is of that ""too long"" length (not long enough for home stereo use, but too long for portable listening)."
1,It has the theory of bass,I give these earphones 3 stars but review at 1 as it is to highly rated. The sounds high and middle are good. The bass however is crap. You can tell there is bass but you can not fell it at all. Bass to me is the most important part of music. These lack severly. Also they are comfortable until you wear them for an extended period of time. Shame on you Sony for putting your name on these.
4,stero headphones,"i am not totally pleased with these headphones. the ear pieces are covered rather loosely in a thin black, material like plastic, and after prolonged use, become sweaty and uncomfortable. (my ears sweat, do yours?)my old cheap ones have a thin foam like covering so they are more comfortable to wear over a long period of time. the sound could be better, but it is passably acceptable."
2,Plug pops out of MacBook Pro mini-jack,"Any comments on sound quality are eclipsed by the mini-plug easily pulling or popping out of my MacBook Pro's earphone jack. So, when shifting position on the couch or wherever, it can slide out, the laptop sound hangs for a second, and then the sound comes blasting out of the laptop speakers. This sounds like a laptop problem but I keep the finger pointed at these headphones - previous Philips and Sennheiser headphones did not have this problem with my laptop.Otherwise a good beater pair of cans if you have devices whose mini jacks are customized for these. Bass a little flat."
4,it's okey,"i bought a beats pro first but then i went to africa to do some volunteer works,beats s too extravagant. hence i bought one of this.it' got powerful bass and present the music pretty well.con are its lack of stereo and the outlook is too simple.besides it's not very comfortable wearing it,you know,all the plastic thingy.but if you mere wanna play xbox using it,it s fine"
2,"Ugh, these things are HUGE!","I bought these because I needed something that would cover my ears while I work out. I sweat so much that earphones would constantly break or one side would work while the other would not. They are big, bulky and super annoying. If you are using them for working out I would look for something else. I would have returned them but the box was open and the instructions clearly said no returns on open items. I was not up for a fight so I didn't bother sending them back. They are here collecting dust...."
2,Didn't meet up to my expectations,"I bought these things after reading allot of good reviews. But sadly these didn't meet up to my expectations. The bass is very lacking and the sound is pretty low quality. I am glad I bought them thought to get a personal experience of them, although they are stylish and fold nice that's pretty much all there is good to say about these. So I returned them before the return policy ran out, and moved to another Brand. After trying a few models Skull candy makes, I decided they were not for me."
4,Good and bulky,"For some reason I was under the impression that this folds, before I bought it. It doesn't and is quite bulky. I would buy one that folds, and I believe there is one for similar pricing. The sound quality sounds good."
4,Comfortable headphones,"I'm no audiophile but these headphones are a giant step up from my laptop speakers and are also the most comfortable I've owned, I will wear them for an extended period of time with glasses on without any ill effects or discomfort."
3,ok but some issues,"These headphones are not bad for the price. They are very comfortable but the sound quality seemed rather ordinary to me. The bass is not very deep. Also, the cord is way too long. I do not know who would need an 11.5 foot cord to listen to music. It could be nice if you want to use them to watch tv i guess. It gets tangled to easily though."
2,Not as good as Memorex HP2000,"If you are looking for an inexpensive headset. . .try the Memorex HP2000. The HP2000 sounds superior to the Sony MDR-XD100 with much better bass response and has a volume and Mono/Stereo switch built into the cord. I use them in my home studio, not for mixing but for the musicians and vocalist to hear themselves. They are hard on headsets so I don't want to spend a pile of dough on them. The earcups get ripped off easily and the plugs eventually break but at $14.95. . .what the heck!"
1,Unacceptable,"PATHETIC. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC!Seriously, if you're expecting full, rich, vibrant sound then these are NOT for you! Way, way too much high and not nearly enough bass. Period. Disregard all the positive reviews you read regarding this product. I lie to you not - should you order these, you're going to be p. oed. Fortunately, I just picked them up in K-Mart on a whim and they're going right back. I'm going to try the Sennheiser 202 that everyone is saying offer the greatest sound for the buck.DON'T ORDER THESE! SONY, HOW COULD YOU?!!"
1,Poorest Quality,"Despite the fact that these headphones have a 4 star rating, they are not described accurately, nor imaged. The two cushions were loosely attached, and as soon as I opened the package, they fell out. Now I'm stuck with two ear cushions and plastic headphones.The quality is VERY, VERY fragile and hard-plastic; it is of utmost discomfort. It's like putting a piece of wood on your ear, it's that hard. The material in the image looks soft and cushioned; it pierces the ears and hurts you within the first few minutes of putting them on. Not only are the ears hurt, but the top part is hard plastic as well, it hurts the head, even when the headphones are extended.The sound quality is great. The wire/cord is long, that's also good. But the quality of the actual headphones is the poorest of its kind. And the fact that the two cushions were not placed on it properly means I'm refunding it."
4,They are really nice but huge,"The sound quality is excellent, however they are so big that they don't really fit on my head, and i wear a 7 7/8 baseball cap which is a relatively large head"
3,I liked it better when it was less than $18.,"Marketing is an amazing thing. Not too long ago, this unit was less that $18., But the price has gone up. But they won't tell you that you now have to pay $ x more for this. So you lose an extra $ x.This is an acceptable headphones, but at the raised price, I recommend this unit instead:JVC HARX300 Full-Size Headphones (Black)It sounds great, lots of bass and you will save some money."
3,"Ok for the money, but uncomfortable","Hmm where to startPros1. cheep but puts out a decent audio experience2. cord is LooooongCons1. The split head band design sucks, only 1 of the bands will be on your head at one time, and they are small. this means that it hurts your head after 20-30 min (it actually leaves groves in my scalp)2. the inside of the ear cups is at an slight angle. this means that one side of the speaker comes in contact with your ear and the other does not this makes it uncomfortable ( i had to put the ear phone son backwards to get them to feel better)3. every thing is plastic"
1,Extremely low volume; surrounding noise seeps in easily,"Just bought them and tried them with my portable and non-portable devices and they are very soft, particularly in contrast to the phones I already own (i.e., Koss Portapro). Based on my comparison test, these are extremely low-volume headphones that require you to turn up the volume on your devices and when you do, there's no bass. Incredibly, for huge cups over the ears, as far as surrounding noise seeping in, it's as if you have on no headphones at all. These headphones look great but the looks are deceiving. Sony's just not as reliable for quality as it used to be. They are very inexpensive but as cheaply made as the price indicates. Guess you get what you pay for with these. If you think the price is too good to be true, that's because it is. BTW, I'd give them 2 stars but I'm trying to lower the mean-rating of 3.5 stars."
1,Simply put... junk and not worthy of a name like Sony!,"I'm going to keep this short and simple for us over 30's crowd.I remember when you used to buy full ear headphones and no matter cheap or not they blocked out ambient noise at least. These things suck!Simple and not so sweet. Trust me they have no volume. I tried them on my PC for movies = not that bad, PC for MP3's = sucked no bass, on my Ipod = sucked again no bass or volumeThey're under $20 I know but come on Sony.My gut was to go with some Sensheisers but I went with Sony because I love my Sony earbuds but I was wrong. These are being returned as I type this.Shop around and don't be fooled by the brand name or the other reviews on here."
2,No Bass,"I came here just to see what others thought of these, because I thought my hearing was off when I heard no bass on them. Fortunately, it's not my hearing. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with these headphones with superb mid range and treble and a shameful lack of bass. I can hear enough to tell that the bass is there. But it really is not satisfying. Even at maximum volume, all it did was crank up the treble and mid range.My suspicion is that the actual speakers in these are very tiny despite the big package, which would explain why they are curiously light for their size. I trusted Sony but I should have listened to the gut feeling I had about the price. Big brand name or not, you will never get more than you pay for."
1,Bad Quality,"I liked these headphones when I received them it was bad quality, I can only hear on one side and if i hold the plug the right direction!!! NOT HAPPY :-(They weren't the cheapest either...."
2,"Pros - price, Cons - headphones","I don't know why this product has so good rating. The only good thing I can see is the price. Wanna good headphones - look for something else, wanna save $$ - this is your bet."
3,AUDIFONOS DECENTES,"BUENO ME ANIMÉ A ADQUIRIR ESTOS AUDIFONOS DE LA MISMA MARCA QUE EL EQUIPO QUE TENGO EN CASA, SON ECONÓMICOS, BASTANTE CÓMODOS, PERO NO POSEEN MUCHO VOLÚMEN LO QUE ES BUENO SI NO QUIERES QUEDARTE SIN AUDICIÓN SIENDO JOVEN, POR LO DEMÁS ESTOY SEGURO QUE EXISTEN OTROS MEJORES, PERO PARA EL PRECIO ESTÁN OK."
3,Horrible bass,"fr the price, these are great headphones. Compared to others, you are better of splurging a little. I would not recommend these to someone who listens to a lot of jazz, hip-hop or techno."
4,Worth it,"for the price, it does a pretty good job of pumping the tunes from my Creative Zen Vision:M player. the bass is not too much (I would have wanted a deeper bass) but again the price is just right for this."
3,UNCOMFORTABLE,"I use this headphones to listen to my TV and Home Theater (Marantz), their sound its ok, tipical headphones you use to avoid bothering others, not a great deal, and they get my ears HOT, after 2 hour use they hurt, and no...I dont have huge ear, you can get better for a few bucks more (whith a few a really mean few, som 5 or 10 bucks more and you are done)"
2,Your ears will burn,"Besides no bass at all which makes you to have max volume, after half an hour of use, my ears turn really hot and becomes extremely annoying"
2,Damn it ...,"The reason I headed for this headphones because I needed it for third person to connect to audio splitter so everybody would listen at the same volume level. I have ""Bassics"" headphones which I bought for 9 bucks in Frys and they sound better and louder then this XD100. I have XD200 for 30 bucks and they sound same good as ""Bassics"" and I have and Au646 for 29 bucks and JVS HA-G101 for $16 and these two sound same low and poor as XD100. Damn it! I ""missed"" in my choice. I should buy Sony XD200 they are a bit expensive but much better."
3,Sony MDR-XD100 Stereo Headphones,"Not to my expiation, but for the price you can't beat them. Great seller promt delivery. Will recommend seller."
2,Cheaply made!,"I had these headphones for all of about 4 months and the cord that went inside one of the earpieces started coming apart and I couldn't hear any sound in one side at all which was very annoying. I got them for free from a rewards program, but I would never buy these headphones again. I got them to replace the Sony MDR-V150 headphones I've had for a few years that are very tight on the ears due to rounded earpieces rather than oval like these. As a result, I was very happy with the way these Sony earpieces enclosed the ears rather than sitting on top of them. Still, for no reason, the cord started coming apart. I always keep my headphones in a safe place so I have no idea how the cord came out rather than cheap manufacturing. Would not recommend. I now have the Sennheiser HD201 headphones which I am very happy with."
2,Hurts my head!,"The sound quality on these is great, but background noise can be heard easily with these on even when they're turned up. The main reason why I don't like this is because the front part of the headphone band at the top rest on my head while the back part doesn't. After using these for a half hour and trying to make them comfortable I couldn't find a way. All the weight of the headphones are on that little part of the band and it hurts after a while. I really wanted to like these, but they are just too uncomfortable for me :("
2,I wouldn't buy this again.,"At first I liked these headphones a lot, but I later realized how bad they were.My right speaker isn't as loud as the left one.This somehow makes my left ear hurt.They aren't comfortable after an hour.I really only bought this because they were cheap and the long cord was awesome."
3,Good sound quality,"The headphones barely fit over your ear, and they are uncomfortable and get hot. The cord is also very long; so if you expect to use these with a laptop or next to your computer, that wire will get in your way a lot."
3,No sounds from the right side,A few months after I bought it the sounds on the right stop working completely. Still it had a nice sound while it work.
2,Disappointed,"This is my 3rd pair of Sony headphones, I have always been a fan of Sony, I've had the MDR V150 & the MDR V6 and loved them. But . . . there's hardly no bass response with these XD100's. They fit comfortably and mids & highs sound nice but NO BASS. I'm very disappointed with these headphones and considering trying a new manufacturer."
3,"Good headphones; sound ok, but very comfortable to wear","I like these headphones. So many non-earbud headphones today rest ON your ears, applying steady and unrelenting pressure on them. I can't stand those headphones, and they always make my ears hurt. So I was really glad to finally find a pair that are big enough to go AROUND your ears, applying no pressure to your ears at all. The headphones could use some more bass, they're a little weak in that area, but for comfort, they can't be beat."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","For the price, these headphones aren't too bad. I like them more than the more expensive Sony MDR-V250s.I wish they were a bit more clear and Sony could have done a better job build quality wise. The plastic on top just feels and looks cheap. They're decently comfortable(given their price).These just may have to do for a $20 pair of headphones to keep in my backpack at all times"
3,Sony MDR,I purchased these headphones because I work in a high traffic area and people can get a little loud. These headphones have been a life saver because it allows me to listen to great music block out the surrounding sounds. The best part is they have a long cord which allows me to move in any direction in my cube without taking them off.
5,BEST BUY FOR THE MONEY IN HEADPHONES!,"These are the best headphones for the price! The frequency response is great, the quality is top-notch, and it's not one of those "" you get what you pay for"" items.They are not spectacular, the cushioning on the earpieces is lacking, the depth of the earpiece is too much so that a little echoing is noticed; but I have used 40 to 60 dollar headphones recently that do not match up to these. Great job Sony!!!!"
4,good for the job and the price,"Satisfied all around. Working around field guys it can get a tad noisy outside my office. While using this set the noise is subdued but I can still hear anything I might need to hear. The price was right, too."
3,Inexpensive but the sound quality & craftsmanship suffers,"I had used these headphones for just under 2 years, they didn't see much use initially but I lost my computer speakers in a move so I had been using them almost daily. They don't feel very good to wear, the cushioning goes over a diagonal opening where the speakers sit.After a few hours of use these made my ears ache every time. A few weeks ago the speaker came loose in the left ear making it scrape and knock against the cheap plastic casing, and muffling the sound. The speakers are of the cheapest quality, naturally. The sound quality for these is very weak in comparison to my new pair of MDR-v150 which is a similarly priced pair of headphones but are not cupped over the ears. I suggest spending a few more dollars for a decent headset or go with a similarly priced ""on ear"" model like the MDR-v150 which sound very nice."
5,Great Headphones for a Great Price,"For the prices, these headphones are great. They sound wonderful, and are the perfect size. Both an adult and child can wear them comfortably. The headphones are also very easy to use."
5,Sony MDR-X100,I bought these to use with my TV in my bedroom. I was very satisfied with their preformance. High quality sound. The padding on the ear cuffs are excellent for long term wearing. This is a very good quality product for a very reasonable price.
4,Nice product,"Its not noise canceling, but is a nice stuff if you consider the price. Good sound quality, nice design, fits well. I recommend."
2,look nice but it has poor sound quality,"The headphones looks nice, but sound quality is poor. I have earbuds headphone and they give better sound than this big headphones. They are comfortable but noise insulation is not efficient, earbuds will do it better. I really trust Sony products, as quality products, but this headphone set disappointed me. Make sure you listen to them before you buy it."
2,OK at first,"These were decent at first, with the downside being the bass had no power. Even without decent bass the mid-high range was very clear so for $14 or so these were an OK purchase. About a month later the speakers are crackling on certain frequencies, so I decided to bite the bullet and buy a high end headphone so I could trash these. The annoying thing is that Sony even bothered to waste any time or materials building these.These are not worth purchasing, but if you want to gamble on how long they last then be my guest."
1,Junk,"These headphones and complete JUNK! Sound is awful, crackly, NOT clear at all. Don't waste your money. Sending them back immediately!"
3,The built quality is decent (for the price) but the sound is terrible,"No matter how you adjust it, the sound in these headphones will not get any better. It's sad because these are really comfortable headphones and to lack that feature makes a big difference to people buying it. I honestly have any complaints about the built quality because I got what I paid for and I am not complaining but I think to not have a feature to increase the volume in this headphone is disappointment. I guess Sony succeeded and failed at the same time when they manufactured these headphones."
4,great sound,"these sound great on my computer and television. the only issues I have are that they get hot on your ears after a while and the very long cord (which comes in handy sometimes) can also get in the way. I wish ~I~ had bought wireless, but these are awesome wired headphones, if you like it loud."
3,Good cheap headphones.,GRADES FROM 1 TO 10comfortable: 7sound quality: 5sound placement: 8Bass: 5Quality/Price ratio: 7Good for watching movies or as second headphones.
1,Yuck!,"These cheap thin light plastic noise emitters are the best headphones I've ever purchased that specialize in only emitting the brightest and most earpiercing excessive of 2k - 8k frequencies. Two tin cans and wire would sound better.If you are tone deaf and are losing your ability to hear mid range then these are for you.Somebody once told me of SONY; ""There's good Sony and then there's cheap Sony. Never mix and compare.""Well, lesson learned."
1,Not Loud...,These headphones look awesome and fit great but they don't sound good at all. I have my cheap set of earbuds that sound A LOT better than these headphones. Sony's name should not be on these headphones. Terrible sound quality!!!!!! Find a better set to buy...
3,"Good Sound, But Hurts the Top of Your Head","These headphones are a decent quality for the price - but beware that if you wear them for longer than an hour, they will cause quite a bit of pressure on the top of your head. If you're going for a pair to wear for extended periods of time, you may want to consider something that had padding on the top."
2,Not very good,"These head phones work, but they are not the most comfterable to wear. They are better than nothing but there are better head phones out there for roughly the same price."
2,Lost sounds in right ear after 2 months!,"Positives: The headphones were cheap, lightweight and comfortable to wearNegatives: after 2 months of moderate use, the headphones lost sound in the right ear.Instead of buying cheap headphones every 2 months, I think I will invest in something a little more long lasting."
3,These are OK but...,"Overall I'm pleased with these for the price. Sound quality is very good. A couple things to note though: These are not great for women - I have them on the smallest setting and they fit OK, but not as snug as I would like. Also, I dropped them a couple of times and now something's rattling around inside the right earpiece. Not good - now I have to replace or repair them. Sony has an exchange program for headphones that are out of warranty (for this model it costs around $16) so it's possible to exchange them, but I'm thinking or buying another kind."
2,not useful,"I bought this product to use it for my computer, and it is not useful because the entrance is not the right one for the commputer."
3,eh,"Sound quality pretty good. But not as comfortable as I thought it would be. Also it's very big and awkward looking, unless you don't care about that."
3,"No comparison to Rurouni Kenshin, but somewhat entertaining","I must say that I am slightly disappointed at this series. This series may be of some interest to people who are into magic and demons storyline, but for anyone who plans on buying this as a replacement for Kenshin, do yourself a favor and skip it."
2,More bloodless sword fighting...,"I must have seen the ""sanitized for your protection"" version.The beginning held some promise of some really good samurai action, but then it turned into something just as silly as that Kenshin foolishness. No blood, no guts plus alot of off-screen swordplay made me very sleepy.Each episode is just like the last one: Monster grabs/assaults the female bounty hunter then Kyo ""Hulks Out"" and bloodlessly kills it. The End.Some of the side characters are pretty interesting though and the sub-plot is not half bad; but I'd rather watch Ninja Scroll again than this."
1,"Dull, dull, dull, and yes, more dull","I have never run across an anime that has made me want to fall asleep more than this series (even Noir is more gripping). The plot is uninteresting and the characters are flat. The artwork is pretty, but not especially unusual.I cannot understand why this series is so often linked to Kenshin. The only resemblance I can find is that there is swordfighting and the main character has a dual nature. It works in Kenshin, because it explores the good an bad sides of humanity; Kyo just suffers from multiple personalites.If you are looking for a good swordfighting/fantasy anime, I would recommend Berserk instead."
3,a pleasing but typical example historical fantasy anime,"If your new to this genre or a fan of the rurouni kenshin series you will love it. The setting is based in medieval japan during the 1500's. The main charcters have a coloful modern style. The story has the nice mix of serious action with a dose of humor and mystery. However I did find some stereotypical things in it. Also the story at first is bit muddy especially in the dubbed english version, but after the first few episodes things do get better. I will not say this is a great anime because I have seen better in this same genre. Overall its a good start for a new series. I certainly do not regret watching it or adding it to my collection."
2,Electrical Storm Review,First off I LOVE U2 but this DVD single is really a waste. It has the music video and a small interview with Larry and a 1 picture photo gallery. I thought there would be a little more to it than this.
1,Airborne Phone - kept Jumping OUTTA THE CASE :-{,"Purchased case for my LGVX 8100 and BT earpiece, about 2 weeks ago.Item worked nicely - AT FIRST---BUT THEN it started to happen -- when I pushed the phone on my belt where I usually have it(horizontal), as I was walking along - my arm brushed up against the case- and my phone POPPED OUT and hit the concrete floor!!! I almost wet my pants - when I saw my bouncing along the floor-TOTALLY BY SURPRIZE.When I finally caught up with bouncing baby, I checked it for damage and was relived that the check was negative. So I checked the case and discovered that the elastic sides that were designed to hold the phone in place, had become loose and the ""snug"" fit was starting to become less ""snug"".Since there was NOT a safety strap to stop this condition (airborne phone)- I quickly ordered a MORE SECURE case and sent this ""dog"" back to the Amazon.com ""pound""So... Use this puppy at UR OWN RISK ---- :-6"
3,Doesn't work on your belt,"This case works best for keeping my phone and headset together in my purse, but if I try to put in on my belt it swivels sideways. My phone hasn't fallen out, but my headset has, making me search a long time to find it. I would think someone could make a case that is more secure."
4,A look into a long-lost culture,"What struck me most about these stories, in addition to the sensitive and thoughtful translation and the wonderful Tevye character, is that they don't really depict the long-lost, static, traditional culture of the Eastern European shtetl (Jewish village). By the time Sholem Aleichem wrote these stories, the life of the shtetl was disintegrating. It was a transitional time, when emigration to America, the influence of Western culture, the pull of socialism and other radical movements, and many other forces were already acting upon traditional Judaism. Tevye, whose knowledge of Jewish sources is picturesque but not very deep, was one of the most knowledgeable people in his town. That pretty much says it all.The Tevye stories are unforgettable, the ""railroad"" stories of more mixed quality. That is why I only gave the book four stars. Still, highly recommended."
3,ok....I guess,"This book is ok if you are an expert or above. I am an improving player, but a lot of this stuff was way above my head. Not quite Dvorstky, but close. A couple of the combos are ok, but some of them come off as simple tricks. Me and a couple of my pals have gotten ""creamed"" by the better players. His first book was better and a little easier to follow. But, overall it is ok for reference. I picked up this one, storming the brigades, and attacking technique. I ended up trading chess sacrifices for the art of attack."
3,"Okay, but one-sided","I've bought this book a while ago and only started going through it very recently. One thing I've noticed is that only White seems to have all the fun (all the sacrifices are performed by White). Am I missing something? Does one just have to kinda ""reverse"" the position, enabling Black to execute the same sacrifes? It's possible (I'm only rated around 1700 ELO), but if so, why doesn't the author mention this then?"
5,Feliway Works For My Two.,"I purchased this product because I thought my guys were marking; however, after a visit to the Vet, it turned out to be a UTI. Therefore, before recommending a product, I recommend a Vet checkup first.I added another smaller litter box on the 1st floor. You should clean all litter boxes daily expecially in multicat households, and change litter completely at the first scent of ammonia. Thoroughly clean all areas previously marked with Natures Miracle Stain/Odor Remover, dry, then lightly mist all four corners of the room no closer than 6"" to 12"" from an object. Feliway has a very calming effect on my cats. Good Luck!"
1,Horrible! Will only bring trouble to your home!,"This stuff is evil! I bought it because my cat was scared of the construction going on at my home, thought it might calm her down. She had never done anything wrong or bad, she was the perfect cat, just a little scared by all the commotion. I plugged the stuff into the outlet, and my cat, my female cat mind you, PEED all over it! She peed all over the area actually! It has to be SEVERELY bad for my cat to do something like that! She has never gone near that part of the house since then, even though I removed it and cleaned up immediately!"
1,Didn't work,"I tried using the spray as well as 2 bottles Plug ins. They were expensive, but since I recently moved, I was hoping it will help alleviate some problems. My cat still meows like crazy and urinated everywhere(he's neutured). I tried for 3 weeks and gave up. It seems like it works for some cats and doesn't on others. I'm the unlucky one I guess"
3,Didn't work for my cat,"I tried everything to get my cat to stop spraying, including this product, but this didn't work. I'm sure it works for other cats, but not for mine."
3,Feliway is Great - Spray? ...not so much.,"I've used feliway plug-in difusers and pump sprayers for a few years with great success. My cats do not like this aerosol type sprayer. When sprayed in room they run away. If sprayed near them they wrinkle their noses and run away. Pump spray Feliway is odorless to human nose but this aerosol smells strongly of the propellent. Company customer service and delivery was just great. I will continue to use Feliway, but make sure that isn't an aerosol sprayer."
3,results of my expectations...,"I purchased this spray along with the plug-in to address my cat's anxiety, (particularly separation anxiety), and some behavioral issues. Since beginning to use the products, along with some ""calm"" treats, her behavior has improved by about 85% which tells me her anxiety level has dropped considerably. I would recommend this product, but I have no idea what the results would be if the spray is used exclusively."
3,All Live Recordings !,"I wish I knew more about where or when,but they are all live.The sound isn't the best,but not that bad.If sound better,would be a 5."
1,no warranty work available,"this item never was able to record incoming messages, panasonic would not honor the 90 day warranty that was supposed to be included. i faxed panasonic the warranty that was included with the unit and they said that that warranty was for a product, telephone, that had been discontinued in 1999! basically the warranty is worthless"
4,Meet the numbers,"Elmo fans will enjoy this way to learn about numbers...Elmo helps readers count objects such as birthday cakes, butterflies and even ice cream trucks.Elmo offers encouragement throughout the book, offering praise for counting correctly. At the end of the book, toddlers reach the ""surprise"" that Elmo refers to throughout the book -- the chance to ""meet"" all the numbers."
1,In a word - BORING,"I expected something along the lines of ""Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story, from Deep in Africa to the Heart of Paris"" which I really enjoyed. Instead what I got was a list of cities through which Clara was shown over her 20 years in Europe, with a few side stories about the who and what of the city thrown in for filler. Many of the pictures cited and analyzed are not included in the book and I had to constantly refer to Google Images so that I could follow the writing.This might have been a good story for Smithsonian magazine if it had been seriously edited. It's 200 small pages, with wide margins and few lines per page. I was bored and felt gypped."
4,Good reference material..,"Bob Gooch has done a nice job of updating his previous book, ""Squirrels and Squirrel Hunting"". This new book should be on every tree squirrel hunter's shelf. Especially helpful to beginners is how to field dress the squirrel. Most have a difficult time with that part of the hunt and his method is quick and easy.With big game hunting becoming increasingly expensive, more hunters are turning to squirrel hunting as a relatively inexpensive pastime. Squirrel hunting remains a real challenge for a .22 (or .17) caliber rimfire hunter.I hope Bob will update his book, ""Spinning for Trout"" as well."
2,The ultimte guide to squirrel hunting,"This book is clearly for someone who has never seen a squirrel , much less attempted to hunt one!!!!!"
5,Somehting for every jazzfan.,"This is just a thorough piece of work. With music examples, pictures, selected discographies, bios, and how their music influenced the world of jazz. It also features great articles about nightclubs and libraries. This is a huge book, and very cheap also, so this is something every jazz fan should have."
1,"Looks nice in pictures, but there are much better choices","Not always accurate.. I tested this scale many times. Sometimes it would give me the same results 3 times in a row.. But then sometimes 5 minutes later, I would get very different results, up to 2 lbs off. I believe part of the problem may be with the flimsy plastic casing of the scale. It looks much more sturdy in the photo than it does when you get it. I am returning this for a higher level Tanita model with a glass base. Overall, I think the Tanita scales are very good, but I think you get what you pay for and this scale is obviously the economy model. If you don't mind your scale being 1-2 pounds off than buy this, but then you might as well buy a cheap analog dial scale and not a digitial scale which is supposed to be within .2 lbs accuracy. There are definitely better choices."
5,It's a soap dish.,"It's a soap dish. It holds bar soap. It seems to handle its task sans difficulty. It is *not* dishwasher-safe, as the bottom has a non-slip felt material on it, but no big. It's ceramic and easy to clean. The soap dish, however, takes up more surface area than I'd expected. Quite a bit more. So if you have a small sink area, you might want to consider another soap dish. On the other hand, if you have lots of bathroom real estate, this soap dish will look sleek and classic with the rest of your chrome & white fixtures."
1,Not what I expected,"This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever come across. Unfortunately it is incredibly boring. It starts off very funny with a wheelchair assassin and gets really bad from there. The story is about a female assassin and the movie feels a lot more like a play. The music was great but it was the only good thing about the movie. The underage nudity has to be commented on also. It was just absolutely disgusting. I don't know how that is legal. This is a piece of art that I enjoyed looking at for a minute, but I found it unbearable to watch the whole movie. I had a lot of trouble getting through the final half hour.DVD from Tokyo Shock is full screened and has very good picture quality."
2,Pistol Opera is not Very Good,I had big expectations for this movie after seeing the trailer for it but I was very dissapointed. The movie has some very nice visuals and is quite beautiful. As well a few of the characters are interesting like the sneezing assasin or the young girl who always carries a lantern. Despite this it is very painful to watch. It is as though the director tried to make a movie into one huge movie trailer. The story is chaotic and there isn't enough to keep your attention. The only thing remarkable about this movie is the nude scenes with a 14 year old girl that push sexual taboos. Maybe the film was an excuse for the 78 year old director to see a REALLY young girl naked. If you are expecting it to be like Ichi the Killer or Versus than you will probably not like it. At such a steep price you should rent before you buy.
5,Great Book,"* Me: I'm someone interested in serious, semi-academic books about Jewish history. I'm not someone looking for a James Michener book, but I'm not some equipped to critique Pollak's scholarship. * The book: This is a wonderful, well-written book that seems to discuss every old reference to the Jews of China in just about every language. It seems to give every known detail about the lives of China's Jews. Because China's Jews were one of the peoples of the ""Silk Road"" (the collection of ancient trade routes that linked China with Europe for many centuries), the book is also a pretty good introduction to the history of the Silk Road. * Who for: I think this book might be especially useful to anyone interested in Central Asian history; Jewish history; or extreme Jewish genealogy (i.e., the DNA testing folks). It could also be the basis for a pretty fine martial arts movie."
2,skeleton chair covers,i was suprised to recieved these cover and find the did not fit my chairs at all. we taped them to the chairs but when people sat in the chairs the covers tore. they looked great up until then. would not recommmend this produt to any one
4,Great Topic; A Bit Let Down with the Approach,"I am an avid reader of books about Lincoln. So, I eagerly anticipated this read. I was disappointed w/ the approach of following both characters through childhood but cutting the story short when it got to the most curious part. Connive Neal, author of[[...]]"
2,So SLOW!,"I really tried hard to get into this book; the subject sounded very interesting. I even took another reviewer's advice and skipped ahead to the assasination (after forcing myself through the first third of the book), but try as I might, I couldn't get into this book. The characters were dull and the story boring. I was immediately drawn in by the prologue, but then the story went nowhere quickly. The part about the assasination was interesting, but the monotony quickly took back over soon after. It is unlike me to not finish a book once I'm already halfway into it, but I just can't seem to muster up the desire to stick it out. I think I'll just skip to the epilogue and see what happened during all those dull pages."
2,Henry & Clara: A Novel,"Only two interesting things ever happened to this uninteresting couple: they were in the theater box with Lincoln when he was shot, and many years later the husband went crazy and killed his wife. While these were highly dramatic events, they were the only high points -- or low points -- in the lives of two remarkably boring people. Mallon has tried to stretch their otherwise idle and pointless stories into an entire historical novel. He fails. Readers will be better served by looking up Henry and Clara Rathburns' bios on the Internet and passing on this tedious book."
5,IS IT RAINING BULLETS?,Nice surprise for my racing fan husband. This wasn't on his Christmas list. Just thought he would like a few extra books to read after the ones he had on his wish list.Great service! Fast shipping for the holiday. No problems whatsoever.Husband loves the book!!
2,No Attempt to Be Believable.,Spoilers:There is so much wrong with this book that I couldn't even begin suspending disbelief. Vampires are an ancient species of shapechanging parasites who coexisted with dinosaurs. Time travel can occur on a ghost train and that train can be hijacked by humans who just barely learned of its existence. Hudson Bay was created by a powerful nuclear weapon from the future transported to the distant past in order to annihilate the vampire species . . . bleh!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Time travelling count vs literary creator and friend.If this book had been written by Tomb of Dracula's Marv Wolfman, it might actually have been ok. Or even if it was a Stan Lee Fantastic Four tale and Dracula was Dr Doom.It wasn't, and it isn't. Frankenstein Unbound is certainly far superior, and there is too much silliness with ghost trains and the like in this book as Stoker and the guy from the earlier novel team up to stop Drac and his dastardly undead doings."
5,Good camera,"It's a great camera. I've got it refurbished from Amazon for 50% of the price. Mine came silver, no ""MACE"" logo. You need a video/power cable, so it's extra 15-20$, but the picture is great. When my $50 CMOS camera switches to infrared BW mode, this is one keeps working in color and showing good picture. If you have a little bit of light around your house, this one is the way to go, you don't need these IR light at all and still get better picture. No red glow from IR, good angle - doesn't attract attention."
5,Does it take a Brit,"I first heard Jeff by chance when looking for new music on Amazon, I have bought all of his albums. I just love what he does, & he just gets better all the time. I have looked at the reviews & find it hard to work out why he isn't more popular in his own country. This CD is as good as any he has done, infact it might be the best so far."
5,FATALITY,"Fatality is a good book when i started reading it i though it was gonna be boring but as i went on reading it, it go better and better each time some times i wanted to keep reading until i finished the book but i knew it as gonna take me a long time but anyways now that im finish i would recomended to all of my frends and everybody i know especially teenagers."
3,O.K.,"This book was pretty good; it had a great plot but i didn't think the ending was very climactic. I never did guess what the secret was, and i had a hard time figuring out the killer. Overall, this is a 3 star book, because of the ending."
3,THE ENDING WAS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I totally love Caroline B. Cooney books. I am a huge fan of her writing and I have read most of her books. This book was okay. I only gave it 3 stars because the whole book except for around the last 5 chapters was increadibly boring. So, Rose stole a police car? Who cares? Although I suppose that Caroline B. Cooney had to have some kind of way to build up to the end. The end was totally fantastic. I couldn't put it down. You will never ever guess who the killer is but I will give you a few clues. It is a guy, but when you read the book that won't help much. They barely talk about the killer at all until the end. So keep your mind open. This was a good book overall but I recommend Hush Little Baby."
4,Good Book,"This mystery by Caroline B. Cooney was very entertaining! She did a nice job of keeping me guessing on events happening throughout the novel. In the book it shows you how one event can change your life dramatically. Rose went on quite an adventure getting herself in a bit of trouble trying to protect her dad from being heart broken. The rest of the world thought Rose was protecting a murderer. For an interesting read, awesome adventure, and mystery read Fatality by Caroline B. Cooney!"
2,Not what I expected....,I received this 4 day ago and opened it right away to let it air out and fluff up. I had read a review that said it would fluff right up after leaving it out for a couple days. 4 days later and still not 3 inches. Many of the crates are still angled downward and don't seem like they're going to fluff up anytime soon. Hopefully it will still make my mattress a bit more comfortable. I would not recommend this.
1,"zero StaRS, only 1.5 inch thich at most, product used, not new;vendor sucks= EVA MEDICAL GROUPS LLC.","zero stars,product used, not new.6 uneven surfaces,SUCKS 1.5 inch thick at most;ZeRO stARS ,EggCrate Foam Mattress Pad - ad says 3 inches ;not 3 inch thick.sold by EVA MEDICAL GROUPS LLC.vendor sucks: EVA MEDICAL GROUPS LLC203 Ridgepoint CirSugar Land, TX 77479.only 1.5 inch thick at most.some spots 1 inch; some quarter inch ,some spots half inch.uneven thickness throughout.top 3 worst buys from amazon.i bought over 150 things via amazon.amazon is great .would not recommend product,[ vendor sucks EVA MEDICAL GROUPS LLC.]zero starS. !!!!!!see all my reviews.if its good ,i say its good.if it's a bad product, i say its bad. !!!////////////////////////////"
2,eggcrate mattress,"Not as supportive as others I've purchased in the past. May as well have gottern a 1"". , foam eggcrate."
3,A fun read!,"If you are an avid reader, as I am, of political fiction nomatter how ""predictable"" in the words of another customerreviewer, you will find this book hard to put down. Of course, the characters are drawn in black and white, and of course the good guys wear white and the bad guys, including, naturally, the in-power politicians, wear black. But does that detract from the fun? Not at all. The good guys are all people you will come to like, and the suspense will keep you up late. Take it along on your next vacation."
3,Pretty good,"Sandra Brown's book exclusive is a decently written book, it wasn't very long, because it was the type of novel for long airplane flights and short drives, it was the type of book that is an alternative to watching reality T.V and saturday morning cartoons. I held no great expectations and it delivered none. The main female character is an impulsive woman who still seeks solcae from her early traumatic life, she embarrasses herself through out the book with her wrong hunches and mediocre ideas. She badgered the main male character into speaking with her, he didn't surrender much, yet, through circumstances spawned by her they open up 'a can of govermental worms you might say'.The rising to falling action is decent, the dialogue is pretty witty, all in all it's not a bad book."
3,"OK, but not worth another read","This was my first Sandra Brown(and hopefully last) paperback. I get most of my books from a friend, who bought this title hoping it would be a Patricia Cromwell-type-..alas. Slick Willy where are you? The plot and character development were predictable. But I will say I read the whole book- in 2 days,my average- and did get some satisfaction. It WOULD make a good movie, given what passes for a good movie these days"
2,An easy read,Pretty unrealistic and predictable. Add it to the list ofbooks that try (and succeed) to take down the president. There's anice little twist at the end that is pretty fun.
2,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed most of Sandra Brown's novels, but this one was a disappointment. I found Bondurant to be a chavanist pig and a jerk and Barrie was just boring. (and obviously stupid when it comes to men)"
2,"Unbelievable plot, perfect beach reading","How do books like this get published? Okay, it was better than some but the highly unlikely, rather sordid plot really pushes the envelope. Here we have a very sleazy President with a well-hidden past and little connection to local politics (we never hear of the Vice President until the very end of the book), a First Lady who has managed to keep her manic-depression under wraps, a reporter who can't seem to check her own work without making rash judgements. The ""hero"" makes a 180 degree turn in character from the background we are given and the plot twist that finally brings the story to a conclusion is so forced as to be laughable."
3,Way Out There,"Okay, this story was waaaay out there, far fetched doesn't even begin to describe it. Yes, we all know there is scandal in Washington, and that politicians usually have their share of skeletons, but this was completely ridiculous ...but not in a bad way. It's fiction, so it stretches the imaginations. It would make a great movie drama for sure. Overall, though very unrealistic, I still enjoyed it. Hey, we all enjoy movies that are way out there, this book is no different. The sexual encounter between the two lead characters which happens a hot second after they meet did catch me off guard, but it keeps you on your toes. I gave it three stars because there wasn't enough romance for me, but it WAS well worth the read ...and the money. Thumbs WAY up!"
5,Wonderful Story,"I loved every page of the book. There were times when Barrie, the main character, acted a little dingie but that's ok. There were several surprises that I did not expect. The areas of suspense were intriging. I was able to get to know the different characters as though I was watching a film. Just loved everything about the story and the author's writing."
5,Better than Steel or King!,"Steel has too much sappy romance, King just scares the hell out of me, fortunately, there's Brown's new mystery/romance writing power to balance the two. You'd think this would be another dull and boring typical Presidential book full of political terms and junk the average person wouldn't understand, but this book was powerful!Sure, the 1st chapter's interview with the lady president is kinda slow, but with the writer's quick but deadly romance scenes, this book drags you in. EXCLUSIVE was the first Brown book I've read, and won't be my last."
5,Presidential Shenanigans In Spades,What Clinton did behind closed doors pales behind the President in this explosive novel. This guy has less moral fiber than your average serial killer. This was my first exposure to Ms. Brown. It won't be my last.
1,Unbelievable actions,"This book never really grabbed me and I don't expect to be enthralled by every book written by authors I like, but this one was really hard to believe. * SPOILER * of sorts:Who walks into a strangers house and falls asleep on the couch (besided Goldilocks)? Who has sex with a guy she doesn't know and who just had a gun pointed at her heart? How does the first lady have coffee at a diner, coffee shop, whatever it was without every other customer not noticing and taking pictures...? This whole book left me consistently saying ""Really?"", ""Really?""...Don't bother if you like a book that makes sense."
3,actually 3.5 stars,I'm a Sandra Brown from way back but I didn't enjoy this book as much as her others.The main character annoyed me at times and i found myself skimming through some of the book.The sex scene in the first part of the book just annoyed the heck out of me because it was so phony.Usually the sexual tension between her characters is very good.The kissing scene was good however which was later on in the book.Her plot twists are always good and have always kept me guessing-don't get me wrong I do enjoy her writing but an author will always have some books that aren't as good as others and for me this was one of them.I'm finding that I enjoy Tami Hoag's writing much more than Sandra Brown's. But because I'm a fan from long back I will probably always read Sandra Brown.
2,Unbelievable!,"My suspicions were confirmed that Sandra Brown has written romance novels in the past. That was my assumption when I read this book. The characters were shallow, the surprise ending was predicted, and nothing about this book was believable. It was fast-paced, and I finished it, but it is one of the least favorite books I've read in a while. We selected this book at my book club, and nobody seemed to enjoy it very much. Overall, it was just ridiculous!"
1,Obviously never been in a newsroom,"Ms. Brown might spend a little time doing research, as it is painfully obvious she's never been anywhere near a news department. These characters aren't even close to the real thing. News people are a lot more obnoxious. I ought to know. I'm one of them."
4,Autograph Collecting pre-1930,"A 300-page book discussing the excitement of autograph collecting prior to 1930, and forgers, with choice facsimiles of many autographs from old European monarchs."
5,Five star pop punk? Believe it!,"Face To Face is the only 90's pop punk band that warrants five stars in my book. This album is absolutely fantastic. There's plenty of typical new school punk here, but the overall vibe is more of a hyper-charged rock feel. Songs like ""I Won't Lie Down"" leave the hyper beats and whatnot behind and make a powerful statement. Catchy choruses, a must for any poppy punk band, abound here, and the hooks get better with each listen. These songs are all quality rock tunes that truly stick in your head. They aren't the contrived attempts at catchiness that you hear Fenix TX and the like churning out. All in all, this is far from deep art, but Face To Face will definitely leave you singing along long after other bands overstay their welcome."
5,Best CD ever!,Face to Face's latest CD is there best yet. I have all of there CD's and without a doubt this is their most amazing by far. If you are a Face to Face fan then this is a must buy.
4,I once sold this CD...,"4.5 stars actually. Believe it or not, I once sold this CD... Bought it again recently, and I'm amazed at how good it is! I used to prefer the first two albums, but now I consider this one as their equal. The sound is slightly more polished, but far from getting to the point of selling out. The highlights for me are Ordinary, I Won't Lie Down, Handout, Take it Back, Complicated, and Put You in your Place, but the rest of the album is nearly as good. I'm a huge new school punk fan, and this album definitely makes my top 20 in that genre."
5,"clean, fast, hard","I've been a face to face fan for five years, and this cd just won't lose its edge...just as good as the day i bought it! if you like emo-core, its a great break from the snotty/poppy punk trend. check them live...loud, fast, sharp!"
4,"Tight fit, classy look","I ordered two pairs of Sudini shoes, both a 6.5 N. This pair was very tight and I almost exchanged them. However, with nylons and after wearing them around the house, they fit. They are still pretty snug, but I think they'll stretch. They are comfortable for all day wear and I work on my feet for part of the day. I like the classic look and they even look cute with dressy capris and dark jeans. I really like this brand for a dressier shoe, I have bad feet and normally wear Danskos with inserts, but my feet have tolerated them so far. I have three pair of Sudini shoes and plan to purchase more."
4,Made for all LATINOS!,"This CD is great for people who like to dance and are looking for that special CD full of energy. The song ""Esta Pega'o"" is, in my opinion, the best song on the CD. This CD includes Proyecto UNO's popular song ""El Tiburon"". Proyecto UNO invites you to dance all day and party all night. When you buy this CD, you will defenatly not regret it!"
3,Suzuki: the biggest Can fan,"Try to imagine a very long jammed version of ""Mother Sky"" but without Czukay, Karoli, Liebezeit and Schmidt. Got it? Other CAN members realized a long time ago that they where running short of ideas. They then decided to explore rather different musical paths with more or less success. ""Damo"" Suzuki on the contrary, is one track minded and insists with the same formula only a ""few"" years later accompanied with a group of jammers that know very well CAN's repertoire.The result however is not unpleasant, only too predictable. In the meantime, Suzuki is having a great party time!"
5,GOD Bless Her,"I must want to appreciate that lady for her courage , for her truthfulnesss. she could have lied like western media.....oh these were really bad, they obused me physically and...., they are crazy, but God gave her a beautiful and bold heart ,GOD Bless you Lady , you are lucky, you saw the light and you are following that light."
2,Same problem as everyone else,We installed this handle and used it for 3 weeks and it jammed just like the other reviewers. I purchased this thinking the other reviewers got lemon door latches but I would not recommend anyone to buy this product. Off to find a different door latch.
4,Could not be installed as received,"The pushbutton could not be installed in the handle as shown.It was difficult to determine which part of the casting was not sized to allow installation of the pushbuttom. The opening width in the handle,for the pushbutton was found, by use of a caliper, to be about .005"" less than the width of the pushbutton. After increasing the opening widthby manual filing, I was able to install the latch and it works very well."
1,"Junk, period.","Purchased this model at a local hardware store. Within two days, the pushbutton on the outer handle became jammed and snagged on the inner portion of the handle.Unscrewed it and released the bind, thinking it was a fluke. One more use verified that this thing is garbage. The pushrod for the button is made of plastic. It bent and became bound on some portion of the inner handle, and cannot be unbound without completely removing the handle.My previous handle, which had a metal pushrod, lasted ten years. This handle lasted two days."
1,I've been bitten again,Once again I thought I was paying for the original hits back in the day but this is yet another re-re-cording of seventies hits done decades later when the singer is showing his or hers age... Thanks for the hits but not for this re-re-cording......
4,3.5 Stars,"Kill Cheerleader have created an album of energetic hard rock, which is something I can appreciate. You won't find anything groundbreaking, here, but that probably wasn't what was intended. Just rock n' roll."
2,plastic to hard/brittle,"My birds chews alot of goofy links weekly but none of the three chewed more than a link each, plastics to hard and the pieces come off sharp"
4,Kellog on Integrated Marketing - very enlightening,"As an MBA student I found this book to be excellent reference material and although not all of the contributors are of the same excellent standards, overall there are enough excellent contributions from various academics to make this a very good book indeed. In the main the book is well stuctured and the topics covered are well sequenced and thorough. The language used is very easy to understand and for a marketing novice like me there were no learning obstacles due to language or assumed levles of knowledge."
3,CT& MRI In Your Pocket,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I had hoped for a quick reference book that would help identify common pathologies in cross sectional imaging, but no. There are many interesting cases included but this book will not be my companion in my pocket."
4,handy & packable,"This is a very compact little phrase booklet with some useful travel phrases & an accompanying CD to help w/ pronunciation. Unfortunately, in the CD the word or phrase is said only once, at normal speaking speed. For the western person wishing to learn a few phrases in this completely new language, this approach is not that helpful. I would prefer a ""Swahili for Dummies"" format, with each word enunciated very slowly & precisely ( maybe several times) & then the word or phrase given again at normal speaking speed. None-the-less, the little booklet is great to bring along with you, to help remember some short & polite words & phrases."
4,Good release from classic group!,"Saw them live in Indiana in 2009. I've always loved the original group, but lead singer Jimmy Beaumont is the only original member still in the group. Donna Groom fills the shoes of original female soprano supreme, The Late Janet Vogel-Rapp. I was very skeptical, but they DO DELIVER on this album of mostly new tracks, except for two useless remakes of their two classic christmas releases. ""One More Mountain"" is worth the price of the disc alone, sung beautifully by lovely & talented Donna Groom. The song tugs at your heartstrings & touches you the way a great song, done beautifully should! Other stand outs are ""You Got Me Ball & Chain"" & ""I Don't Care Anymore"". Not as good as their classic tracks from the late 50's to late 70's, but there shouldn't be any comparing because the group is not the same as it was in it's hey day. Recommended!"
5,This is simply beautiful,"I bought this CD because my church choir was performing a segment of it. Gorgeous ... both the music and the words. If you haven't heard it, you've missed something. Not your ""traditional"" church anthem. And the poem (St. Francis) is truly inspiring. It celebrates the majesty of God in the creation of our universe."
4,Very Good Headphones,"I wasn't expecting headphones of this quality because of the price, whenI first look them I just felt surprisedI simply love 'em"
3,Low price but dull sound,"These 'phones are very light and comfortable but -- on musical program, at least -- suffer greatly from boomy bass and dull sound in the top end. For the extremely modest price they rate 3 stars. Those seeking accurate and involving playback of music need to spend more."
5,Loving them...,"If you want a cheap, yet great sounding, headphones. Buy these, they are much better than my previous headphones."
3,Creaking plastic :: Cheap construction,"The sound is okay for the price -- hence the three stars, but something I've not seen anyone mention is that every time you move your head, you hear the plastic creaking. It's something that annoys me greatly. I usually use them at my desk while working, but if I had to move around much, it would drive me crazy. I'm probably going to spring for the Bose Triports and give them a try.Update: I bought the Sony MDR-7506 for the office, and a whole new world has been opened up for me. I've got a set of MDR-V6's on it's way for the home office. Also, I've got the Beyer Dynamics ear pad replacements coming. I would strongly suggest spending more money and skipping these."
3,You get what you pay for,"I got these headphones a few months ago. I am happy with the sound for the most part and the pads are comfortable. But depending on what you are using them to listen to, the sound may be slightly muffled. I like to use them on the computer sometimes and that's when they've been their best.The headphones are a bit large and can get annoying. They're also distracting to what you listen to if you don't sit perfectly still because they make a bit of noise rubbing against your ears/head. There is no perfect fit. For the price you pay for these, they're pretty good."
4,"Great, but not the best.","I have a pair of Boss headphones and those have much stronger bass and sound quality hands down, but these do the trick."
4,sony bumpers,sound great and make a good gift. recieved quickly in perfect condition cant beat the price!
3,Sound is great... but not very comfortable.,"I had previous Sony headphones and it was great. We use the headphone only for flights so we decided to buy another pair for my husband. He wanted to try different headphones. When we received heaphones I was amazed by their size. I was happy thinking 'that's great' finally I won't hear anything else on the plane just the sound. Well, my excitement vanishes after I used them for 15 minutes. I found them uncomfortable and wanted to take them off. Sound is great, you can choose different sound modes, which is perfect but ... if I have to choose them again? I wouldn't and I would go for old Sony style which we had before."
4,Worth the Purchase,Looks greatSounds greatIts lasted good for bout a month nowI dont gt the Music to Movie sound format switch on it...makes no significant change for me butIt works fine
1,"Cheap feel, and just low quality for the price",Save yourself the 15 extra dollars and buy the sennheiser hd 202 like i did after i was not happy with the quality of these sony headphones. they feel super cheap and flimsy and the sound quality is much lower than that of any 20 dollar set of headphones.
2,You get little bang for your buck,"I was trying to switch headphones so I decided to get these by Sony. I used to have the black over the head earphones that cost about the same. I shouldve got those instead of these bulky, crappy sound quality earmuffs. Probably the worst purchase I've made in a few years. Buy if you love dissapointment"
1,worst headphones ever,These headphones are the worst purchase i have ever done in my life... The sound is so low.. You can listen what other people is telling you even if you have the volume at the max... Also the bass is poor and you can verly notice it... The dessign made me purchase them but the performance of them is bad... Is the worst headphones i have ever used... My headphones that came with my phone are better than this things... Im so sad about this purchase.. But is nobodys but my fault.
3,Headphones have good sound but...,The sound quality is very good but you need a head the size of a watermellon to get them to fit. I have to hold them with both hands so the cut down on the sound leakage. The wire from the headphones to the receiver is really cheap.
3,"sound good, comfort bad","Sound quality is good for my untrained ears. The cord is hefty and thick.The problem is the fit, the top of the headphones is bare plastic and quickly feels like bare metal slicing into your scalp; I cannot imagine the red marks on a bare skull. The fit over the ears is pretty good, but again the top part is bare plastic that digs into ones scalp immediately."
3,Audio issues,"I've only had these 1 day now, and have only listened to a variety of music from my computer and various online feeds (youtube, webcasts...)I am also a professional piano tuner (think concerts) so I listen very carefully to the entire range of sound.Pros: What I can say is that they do present a favorable overall sound, which is nice and full. The bass is deep and consistent with the other ranges. I don't require extra bass boost - as some do. And let's not forget these are very light and comfortable (with a super long cord).Cons: But, no matter what I listen to (save CDs), there is lots of background distortion. It would be similar to white noise, except it's a digital sound. This is my greatest complaint! It matters not if I listen loud or soft, that digitalized white noise is constant! (note this is not a hissing sound, or open mike sound as its pitch is in the mid-range)I also feel the volume is dialed-in pretty high, so that I must lower all other volume settings."
3,Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones,"In a nut shell,They're not bad, and they're not good either. I have owned a pair of Sony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones for the longest time- comparing the two?The MDR V150 unfortunately for me, are better. The bass is better, They're louder, they're clearer, they're deeper and they're much more practical.Again if you're upgrading from 2$ earphones, it wouldnt be such a bad buy for the priceBut if you're ""upgrading"" from average headphones, don't get your hopes too high"
4,Good headphones for your buck,"First off, these are huge but comfy as well, they encompass my ears and are great for long wears, no sore ears here! Sound quality is solid and bass thumps well while mids and highs are crisp and easily distinguishable, cord length is nice. Sure they are plasticy and you can hear them creak when you shift but look at the price tag. Ya gotta expect some drawback at that price. Otherwise these were a great purchase, and I love them."
4,"Plastic-y, but good","I bought these headphones for light use as to watch movies or listen to music from my computer when my roommate is asleep. The sound reproduction is great and the headphones do exactly what they should.The only downside in my mind is their lack of weight. The things probably weigh about 1/4 a pound all together and just feel plastic-y. I was not in the market for great quality headphones, but for $20 I would think they would feel more sturdy. Possibly a plus if you find other pairs of headphones to be uncomfortable."
3,nice look,The headphones were not what I expected. They were very big and comfortable. I figured I would give them a few days to break in. The sound was very muffled and stayed that way. I was really hoping for better quality but for $25 you get what pay for.
2,Dull sound,"sound quality is very bass and mid centered, so they sound muddy and dull.the highs are compressed too much.they only sound good when you eq your sound source to balance this issue out.the headband gets uncomfortable over time because its not padded...and it squeezes the top of your head for some reason.the whole set is plastic anyway, which is why its a cheap set. im gonna get some better ones soon"
2,TOO BIG!,"i look so silly with this headphone on. it's ginormous! i wouldn't mind if the material/design look better. it looks & feel very cheap. it sounds decent for a $20 headphone, can't complain there."
4,headphones,These headphones have a great sound and drown out most of the noise at the gym. The only downside is that the cord is too long for the gym. I had to shorten it with a clip.
3,"Good sound, but fragile design","Got two years' use out of this product, but thin wiring at connection to headphone breaks inside insulation, and static and intermittent cutouts result."
4,Solid Headphones,"These headphones are super comfortable and sound great. I would definitely recommend these. If you are an audiophile you may want to splurge on something more expensive, but the bass and treble were perfect for me. One of the things I like best is the extra long cord so no extender-cord was need to sit on my couch and listen/watch my favorite shows with my new headphones."
5,Clean sound,"Great headphones for the price, sound is crystal clear, awesom choice for meditation and entrainment, its range of 10Hz to 22KHz and sensitivity of 102 dB allow a fantastic sound experience, comfortable covering ears, long enough cord."
2,Why the price increase?,"I have a pair of these headphones, and I love them. I git them on Amazon a little over a year ago, and I somehow broke one of the ear pieces off. I pulled them up online and saw the price of $60. I knew that wasnt what I paid. I pulled up my old order and I paid $14.53. Right under $25 with two day shipping. They were good headphones for the price of $15. But at $60 they aren't worth it. I dont under stand why they would more than quadruple the price. I will be getting something else to replace my broken set.All of the reviews saying they are great for the price are also from before they cost $60. They are not great for the price anymore. Think about it. You will be buying headphones that sold for $15 for the longest time, only you're paying $60 for them."
2,Meh,"I wouldn't recommend this set of headphones. You can tell it's cheaply made. The design of the headband is ridiculous; it creates pressure at the top of your head which is uncomfortable after a few minutes. The sound quality is average at best. And even at the softest volumes, it is still audible to someone sitting next to you.edit: I paid $24 for these two years ago. They weren't worth THAT amount. Now they're charging more than double!"
5,An alternative to V150,"I normally only use the Sony V150 studio headphones. Thought I would give these a try. These tend to fit my head a little better and in my opinion the audio sounds just a bit better that the V150. I use them mainly while watching TV on my 32 inch LCD and I find I don't need to turn the volume up quite as much for comfortable hearing. However, these headphones do not have reversible ear cuffs like the V150 which allow you to listen with only one ear as a studio monitor. But if you have no need for that these may be a viable option. Either way it's SONY so for the price what else can I say except I'm very happy with them. Can't go wrong as far as I'm concerned."
2,Cheap,"I really got what I paid for buying these. they are pretty comfortable, I will admit, but they lack in the important quality I was looking for -- sound quality. I may be a bit of an audiophile but I know bad headphones when I use them. The mids are not that powerful and the highs just crackle annoyingly. And do not believe these provide good bass response. I would say that any sound under about 50Hz just buzzes and is about as annoying as the highs. Don't bother with these unless you really don't care."
3,"Comfort, not quite up to standards.","A great product for the price; however, what it lacks is a comfortable headband to go along with its plush ear-covers. I find that when I use these headphones in an upright position (standing or sitting) the headband causes general discomfort due to a design flaw that doesn't evenly distribute the preassure on your head. Yet listening to music laying down is perfectly comfortable. I would reccomend looking into not only the ear comfort when buying headphones but your head comfort as well. All in all its a great deal, but i'm not sure that I would ever buy these again."
4,studio quality,"These headphones are HUGE with a HUGE cable. They indeed make quite a fashion statement, so I am not too sure they are good for people looking for modern style. However, they perform flawlessly, giving me crystal clear low to high frequency sound be it movies or music. I would absolutelly recomend them for anyone with a home studio or someone trying to show off that size does indeed matter. love the headphones and for their price you can't get any better. They will deffinetelly last a long time and are so far my favorite headphones out of my many sony and skull candy models."
4,Good but not great,"Nothing very special about these headphones, but for this price, its the best out there. If you are an audiophile, there are better models for $20-30 more. About these phones - great fit, great comfort, good sound. As I said, best in its class for this price."
4,Not too shaby for the money,"I use these as studio head phones for a internet pod cast. I also use them from time to time for music. For the money they do the job. They are pretty good for blocking out outside noise. The little sound switch is about the only useless thing on these phones. Although, I have to admit that my ears are not what they used to be. The cord is nice and long and the foam ear covers are large and as close to old school head phones you can get with out spending a ton of money. These totally enclose your ears. If you want a decent budget set of head phones that are comfy. These will fit the bill."
4,Good value,"These cans are a pretty good value. Very comfortable, nice long cord. Sound quality is OK. Bass is way too emphasized but for the price, I can't complain."
4,"Sounds great, comfortable, but not as described.","Great sound and comfort for the price. Well worth the money. Just one issue: the product does not quite match the description on Amazon:""Features include high-energy neodymium magnets, a 2.5m extension cord and a convenient sound mode switch to match the sound source. Listen in style and comfort with the MDR-XD200 Studio Monitor Series headphones. Frequency Response - 10Hz - 22,000Hz Impedance - 70 ohms Sensitivity (db) - 102dB/mW Headband - Adjustable, Single, Music/Movie Sound Mode Switch 3.3 Feet (1m) Cord - Oxygen-Free Copper Lutz Accessories Supplied - Unimatch(R) plug adapter plug in type (gold); Sony Warranty card""The product does not come with a 1m cord plus a 2.5m extension cord - one of the reasons I purchased it - but with one long (I'm guessing) 10 foot cord."
5,Excelent headphones,"I bought these when my old ones went bad. They were priced right and had mostly good reviews, so I took a chance and I'm glad I did. I use them mostly for my computer, but when I tried them with the stereo I was amazed at the quality of the sound. They don't block out ambient sounds very well but I just turn up the sound a little and they are fine. I highly recommend them."
4,up to you,The sound overall is really good especially considering its priceearpad is comfortable and cushionyhowever bass seems a bit boomy at timesand i didnt like how the wire is freaking 3 feet long!Only other con for this earphone is it doesnt cancel noiseas well as i hoped it would
4,Nice buy,"Overall its a good headphone, solid but not deep bass, good vocals and It's really confortable and something unbeateable is the price; for $20 you can't get nothing better than this."
5,very nice phones,"It was a gift for a young relative and it was a success ... he enjoyed it very much, for the sound is impressive, the noise filtering is astounding and the connection cord is long enough to reach the stereo and the TV, from the bed. Very nice product!!!"
3,Stereo-Amazing. Bass-none.,"Using it for music: If you are looking for a pair of headphones with a decent to great bass, this isn't it. With that said, other aspects of quality are great.Using it for movies, games, TV, etc: Great sound, good quality.Depends on what you are looking for."
5,Great sound for the price!,"Cord was chewed up recently, but great product until it happened. the sound was great, and the cord length was a great bonus. Feels plastic-y, but that's okay for the price."
2,Not impressed,"My old Sony MDR-CD180 headphones have lasted forever, sound good. I got tired of having to press the ear piece to my ears when I listened to my fav songs...wanting to hear every beat to the fullest. These headphones are no different. The sound is about equal to my old Sony standby headphones. I find myself changing the sound mode on this headphone during songs to try to get the best audio possible. The sound quality is elementary to average. I am also still pressing the ear piece to my ears in order to hear every beat to the fullest. I am not impressed with these headphones. Just blah...average. If you really like music and need to use headphones, like me, this is not a good pair to get. I also seem to get a static sound when turned up loud. I have no recommendations of another pair. I will continue to look for a better pair. My head seems to be a normal size so I am not sure why the headphones don't fit tight enough on my head!"
5,A really good deal!,"I'm not a professional, just an ordinary user!I can say I really feel comfortable in this headphone and after a very long time I found out that I can listen to music and not to be bothered. I could buy a good headphone with a reasonable price. By the way, I wear glasses and I don't have any problems."
3,Bad fit on my head,"Sound quality is good, but I find the fit on my oval-shaped head is uncomfortable. The span of the headband seems designed for the more brachycephalic. If you are an egghead, or a ""pointy-headed intellectual"" (as Joe McCarthy used to rave), these might not fit so well."
4,Its good for the price.,"This headphone is good for it's price range. It produce decent sound, the design is pretty nice, and it feels sturdy. However I find it uncomfortable after about 15minutes of listening. The weight of the headphones rests on the top of your head making it feel much more heavy than it really is. Another con is that this headphone isnt very loud. The headphones also make squeaking sounds when you turn your head because of the cheap ear cushion. Bottom line, if you plan to rock out with these headphones they will disappoint you. I my self will be looking for another one."
5,Big headphones,These are very nice headphones for the price. They are comfy and loud enough for me. My wife likes them because she wears eyeglasses and they do not pinch on her head.
4,Sony MDX-XD200,"Nice, Comfortable head set. Would be nice it it had balance control. For the price it is very good."
4,Pretty uncomfortable after long usage,"I've had these headphones for about a month and I have yet to become accustomed to the top headband. It really could have used some sort of padding because after prolonged wear it didn't give me headaches, but definitely made the top of my head ache. Sound quality was good. Just beware of comfort issues. Just move the headband around a bit and you'll be fine."
4,Best sound quality for the price,"Other than the size, sound quality is better for the price paid. Between Behringer HPX2000 and Sony MDR-XD200, Sony is much better in sound quality"
4,Yep. These are definitely headphones.,"I got these a couple years ago and they have been great ever since. Not a huge audio buff or anything, but I think they sound fine. I chewed on the cord and it turns out that was a bad idea. I bought a second pair because the left ear went in and out. Overall these are great as long as you don't plan to eat them."
4,Good headphones but there are better options,"I wanted an inexpensive pair of full sized headphones and ended up purchasing the Sony MDR-XD200 and the Koss UR-20. They are both nice and sound great but I do like the Koss headphones better. The Koss headphones come with a better warranty and seem to have a higher quality build (thicker, more rugged cable and generally feel more solid.) I also find the Koss headphones to be more comfortable. I wear glasses and have a pretty narrow head. The Koss headphones hold on much better and are softer, wider and more flexible over head. The Koss headphones are also a bit less expensive. I do like the Sony headphones but think that at this price point the Koss UR-20 is a better option. Hope that helps.Koss UR-20 Home HeadphonesSony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones"
2,pain,"Wearing headphones longer than thirty minutes resulted in a headache from painful pressure points on top of my head. Poor design or poor manufacture quality control delivered headphones with zero padding effect from overhead support. I will use a stripe of soft foam or bubble wrap to counter the problem. I would not buy this product again, but I will keep it for its good sound/price ratio, as long as I can come up with padding that works for me."
4,For $20.00 you can't go wrong.,"Great pair of headphones. Very comfortable to wear and the sound is great. The 10 ft cord is a big plus also. Works on ipods also. However I couldn't give it a 5 star for the sound is not contained within, you can still hear some music coming through the outside. Unless you want to use them in bed while your partner/spouse is sleeping, these will do just fine. For twenty dollars I have no complaints. I highly recomend them."
2,Very comfortable but dull sound,"These are one of the most comfortable headphones I've ever had. However, the sound quality is very dulled and lacks clarity. It's like listening to music through a wash towel. I also can't tell a difference using the movie/music switch. The only time I use these are during long gaming sessions when comfort is more important than sound quality. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks to get the Sennheiser eh150. If you want true Sony quality, get the excellent MDR-V6."
3,fine for the price,"As others have said, these suckers blast a lot of sound out from your ears, so those around you get a pretty good show. The head strap isn't the most comfortable, and bumps the top of my head. The cord is also very long, so is useful for DJs and the like but not for Ipods (there is no way to adjust)Overall, for the price of around 25$ they are fine. However, I think as soon as you get to 35$ range their are much stronger options."
4,Standard headphone,"I read the first review here and thought the product was a marvel, but actually is very standard. For the price I consider this product very affordable and an option for those who wants better sound than earphones or want something more comfortable."
5,"excellent conditions, incredible sound!!","i love the sony headphones, they have high quality sound.. is a complete different way of music.."
2,does not work good,only worked for a few months and then the sound went out of my left headphone and didnt work anymore 30$ went to the dogs not happy :(
4,Comfortable but disappointing,"I've had mine for 3 days now and I have to give sony credit for making very comfortable and light headphones. On the other hand, I was really hoping for a strong, defined bass with moderate mids and highs but it sounded just a little better than $10 on the ear headphones. Actually, a lot better than that but don't expect big, booming bass. I used to have Skullcandy Ink'd in-ear phones and when I listened to Love Lockdown by Kanye, it was amazing the depth I perceived from those $10 items. However, these cans have trouble reaching that bass and sound muddy and distorted even at lower volumes. Any other song, it sounds average. For the price though, I really can't complain."
3,You get what you pay for,"I was looking for comfortable inexpensive headphones and these fit the bill perfectly. While I am sure it will get many bad reviews from Audiophiles out there that any under $500.00 set of headphones would. For me these did the thing for those rare times I needed to keep the audio from my computer from grating those others in my house that didn't want to share what I was listening to. I have worn them for hours and after time forgot they were there, very comfortable and good sound reproduction while at the same time blocking out the jet engine that is the noise my computer makes. When my Katz have chewed through to many breaks in the cord to repair I will look to replace these headphones with the same model."
3,Ehh,"I've had these for about 6 months or so. I bought them for $35 back then, so they were really affordable. However, now the ear padding has just gotten too dense and hurts my ears after wearing them for a while. By comparison, I can wear my Steelseries headset on LONG flights or all day, working on a project on my computer and not feel much, if any strain on my ears.So, they're okay because they were affordable, but there are better headphones out there in the current price range."
2,Please stay away (mediocre sound),"I went to J&R; with the thought of buying this off-the-shelf. But their sound wall with headphones changed my mind. I heard this one and I was almost immediately disappointed. They have a very rounded, muffled tone that lacks punch and crispness. The ONLY good thing about them is the big ear comfort.But then I ended up buying Sennheiser HD 218 after listening to many. They aren't big, but provide equal comfort. The sound is much better for just 10 extra dollars."
3,Hugeeeeeeeee,"This earphone is so big, it is not funny, we have decided just to use it on the PC because it really has good clear audio guality, but i wouldn't buy it if i was needing something to walk around in."
3,No bad,It is ok and you can't expected much with this price. This is my first headset and I may look for a better one.
3,Ummmmm,"OK , The quality is bad for Sony brand , The sound is go out of it , But it's very comfortable and that's what I need."
1,Muddy sound,"I dont normally review items but i had to say something about these headphones.. They are horrible. I have a cheap set of Koss headphones that sound better. The sound quality is very poor. I plugged my Koss and the Sony in side by side and I was very disappointed in the Sony's. The Sony's had such a muddy sound, no clarity at all. It almost sounded as if i had earplugs in my ears. Maybe i got a defective set of headphones."
1,lame,"these headphones are really big. they do not fold to fit easily in a backpack or anywhere else. the cord is waaaaay too long. wearing them, you look and feel like a jackass."
1,screaming headache,"I bought these headphones to use while doing medical transcription. After having them on for only about five minutes, I have a headache. It comes from the way they sit on top of my head. Most of the weight is supported on the top of the head. The earphone part covers the ears completely and are perfectly comfortable. This might be a physiological problem with the shape of my head or the path of the cranial nerves. But, wearing headbands for my hair bother me as does a ponytail for too long. I hate them, but if you dont have a problem with a puff of wind giving you a migraine, you just might love them."
2,These TOTALLY SUCK!!!,"Uncomfortable. They do NOT CANCEL out ambient noise. The ""movie/music"" switch does not do anything to the sound. Sound is muffled; the treble is lowered while the bass is slightly amped up. If you want good noise cancelling headphones, spend $100+ dollars!!!"
2,After many uses.......it fails all together.,"I bought this trash in October 2009. I really didnt start using them daily until February 2010 because I hated the music on the radio. In June 2010, one of the phones did not work anymore. This was probably in whole or in part the fault of that crappy ""music/movie"" mode switch on the side, which is also a pretty pointless feature as the sound is no different in any mode. The overall material consist of cheap and easily breakable plastic. There is absolutely no cancellation either way and at max volume, the sound leaks clearly. And after long usage you will began to sweat because of how tight they are on your ears. My recommendation: get Sennheisers 200 and up series."
2,"Uncomfortable, Sound not great",I've had these for a while and have them hooked up to my stereo receiver until I get a new pair of headphones. These headphones are terrible. They hurt after a minute or two of wear. There's no comfort in the earpieces and the design is so that there is always an uncomfortable spot around the ear.Stay away from these headphones
3,Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones,It is not that good as I expected. If people stands next to it could hear it.
2,Not good for music,I bought these for my mp3 and they are worst than my old head phones. They are not as loud and you can hear the music about 30ft at high volume away. One thing that is wrong with this is that can they make this cord any longer? The cord is at least 8ft tall maby 12ft. I think this is like a tv head phone thing so I kinda got ripped off but if its for tv style who would want to buy one that's has a huge embarrassing cord?
4,Excellent!!!,"I purchased this item one month back, its bass quality is super and it doesnt have microphone.It has good sound quality and superb adjustments."
4,Great Headset For the Price,"These are very good for the money. My only real complaint is the cords seem a little bit lite, I would like to see a heavier gauge sheath on the cord, outside of that no complaints."
3,"Not great, cheap quality.","These headphones are definitely bulky. They wore out fairly quickly, likely due to the cheap cord. The cord is very thin, just a little thicker than that of earbuds, and after a month the right ear stopped producing sound. They produce good sound for the price and are a decent buy if you plan on using them occasionally and really want them to cover your entire ear."
4,Good Product for the price,"This is a good product overall. The sound quality is good but could have been better. The two knobs that proudly claim the 'Movie' and 'Music' do nothing for the sound. I was looking for a cheap headset that I could use to watch movies on my laptop. Useful for listening to music too.Pros:Clear SoundGood for movies and music.Cons:Too big for my ears (not compact)The very long cable sometimes is a nuisance (it usually gets tangled with the power chord or the mouse chord)No internal volume control.Unless you are looking for budget headsets, buying this product makes little sense to me. I would advise you to spend another 15-20 bucks and buy better Sony or a Sennheiser product- if cheap is not your priority."
4,Worth what you pay for,"Mediocre headphones. Does the job well and it will last a long time if you use it correctly. If you want something to watch Netflix or do some PC gaming, then these headphones are for you."
3,Slides off your head,"These are good head phones to buy for the money. Great sound qulaity BUT THE GRIPS ARE TOO LOSE. The adjustments hardly help at all, I liked that I could play my electric guitar with the adapter but after a week I gave it too my firend. Not viable for me, I would recomend spend a tab more and get something with better grips. Kinda a cheap product but again great sound quality."
4,"Big & Bulky YET, Great Sound !!!!!","Great Sound!!!!! They are bigger and bulkier than I had anticipated yet, very light weight. NOT disappointed with the sound quality...especially for the price."
3,Lacking but they are only 20USD...,"So I bought these bc the Denon AHD2000's are way outta my price range right now so I'm saving up for them. I bought these to suffice my hunger for music and sound. They don't sound GREAT, but they are only 20.USD. So I can't complain and neither can you. You can get these LOUD without distortion. Bass and Highs are lacking. They are really aimed at reproducing the mids. Which is just Blah for any kind of sound. But if you want a cheap over-ear headphone these might be for you. I'm keeping them just bc I kno I wont have them for very long. You may want to try different."
3,Fine,"Good sound quality, but lightweight and does not block outside noise out very well which is why I bought completely over the ear headphones."
3,"For the price, these phones are very comfortable. Just don't expect great sound.","Based on other reviews, I was hopeful I had found an affordable decent-quality set of headphones. These might best be used as a photo prop; they just aren't very good.While they fit well and are very, very comfortable, the sound quality is only so-so. If you're planning on using these for bass-heavy songs as I was, look elsewhere. For all other audio needs, these are adequate at best as the sound is very heavily focused on mid-range tones, which sometimes results in a ""music in a tincan""-type sound."
2,Painful,"Pros:Price, Decent soundCons:Very uncomfortable(Read:headband), Poor build quality(both the headphones and wire), Noisy when u shift positions (Poor quality of plastic used)"
5,Listening Pleasure,I enjoy my new headphones. They are of an affordable quality and make listening a pleasure.
3,Ehhh...,They aren't bad for the price but the 10 foot cord gets kind of annoying and they get uncomfortable after a while
2,Pretty disappointed,"This was to replace a very light weight headphone with small ear cups. Upon arrival, I tried them out and used them for about an hour. OUCH!! They began hurting my outer ears and after said hour, I felt like ripping them off. As far as the audio control for music, or movie listening, I couldn't tell any difference. I am very disappointed in these headphones but feel stuck with them as they aren't defective, just uncomfortble and bulky to wear. I hate to throw money away, so guess I'll keep them till they croak."
3,Sound Quality Good but Comfort is lacking,"I bought these headphones as a cheep alternative to my $100 K-240 Monitor headphones that were on their last leg. the sound quality easily matches that of my previous headphones and the over the ear comfort is actually better, but when you put on the MDR-XD200 the part that is supposed to rest on the top of your head just digs down into your scalp. these headphones were made with people with square heads."
2,"painful headstrap, which ended up cracking","I have to use them with a rag of shirt on top of my head for padding because the weight of the headphones causes the straps to cut into my scalp, very uncomfortable."
2,Can't wear for more than 30 minutes.,"UPDATED REVIEW - These shouldn't be worn more than 30 minutes at a time. Spend $100 and get some great headphones. You WON""T regret it. I regret getting these.Everybody says headphones make such a big difference. You don't believe them until you have good headphones. These are pretty comfortable but I wouldn't rely on wearing them for more than a few hours at a time. The top of them that sits on your head could use a little padding but I'm a wuss so that's not a big deal.The sound is great in my opinion. Don't know why they have a music - movie switch on BOTH ear phones but they do...I don't change the setting but maybe it matters. Overall a good purchase. I know the cord is SUPPOSED to be long but honestly it's annoyingly long. Not a reason not to get it, but you've been warned."
4,Best headphones for a low price,"I bought these headphones because skull candy kept failing me. I had no idea how good these where going to sound. But when I test headphones I usually listen to Animal Collective songs. They have these little sounds in there songs that only GOOD headphones can pick up. So I listened and i was AMAZED. I asked the person if she was charging the right price when I tried them out as i was astonished that something below 30$ was this good.The only bad thing is that after wearing it for a while it tends to get uncomfortable, but who cares about that. If your a college student and are really into hearing everything in a song with the best quality possible and cant afford those Sennheiser/ akg or any top of the line headphones, I HIGHLY suggest getting these headphones.P.S. Ive had Sennheiser in the past lots of other headphones"
3,My dads is hard to please,"Bought as fathers day gift for him to use with his desktop, complained about sound quality... Unit has a movie and music mode which I didnt care for much but could use more then pops. May just take them from him and use for my office... Get him some better ones.."
4,Highly Recommended,"Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo HeadphonesAwesome headphones at a phenomenal price. First off the delivery was prompt, as a matter of fact it was actually earlier than was expected but thats the kind of exceptional service that is unique to Amazon.The sound quality of this product is very clear, the quality you would expect from a more expensive product. When on movie mode it sounds like you're in a movie theatre, with surround sounds. Also it blocks any background, unwanted sound. The length of the cord is long enough to allow some movement away from the media source without any interruption,that is you dont have to remove the headphones. And last but not the least, the extra, larger adapter is an added bonus.I did not give this product 5 stars only because it does not fit my head as snuggly as I would like. I get a lot of compliment when I take it to work. I would urge you to get these headphones if you are in the market for said product."
5,GREAT HEADPHONES!!!,"I just got these today and they came a day early so I was pleased with that. When I first tried them on they where so comfortable. when i tried them out the sound quality was prefect. They did not wine in your ear like others do. The only bad thing is they are really big,its almost awkward to where them in public.all in all I'm really happy with these headphones and they are supper cheap."
4,Good Headphones,The sounds is good and balance in my opinion. I use them to watch movies in my dorm. The long cord let me plug them into the tv and watch tv from my bed without disturbing my roommate.
4,light head phone,"Very good sound quality, good enough for minor use because of its light material. Overall it is acceptable. I will upgrade to a professional-like headphones later."
3,Pretty good but not without its faults,"I like many of you were looking for an affordable around the ear headphones for music, gaming, and movies. After all my searching i chose these mainly due to price constraints.Pros:1.Cheap2.nice sound3.nice bass (just have to tweak the equalizer settings)4.light weightCons:1.it feels kinda flimsy (im a very careful person but im afraid i might break these)2.the ear phones do get rather warm after a while(1-2 hrs)3.it creaks upon movement due to the cheap plasticOverall they are not bad heaphones they deliver really nice sound and bass, they are comfortable until they start to get hot. For the price that i paid ($25) they are okay but if you are looking for a definitive headphone (like i was for gaming)i suggest you look else where. also the cord is 10ft long which for me wasnt a problem (using it only for home use). the ear muffs dont really block out sound but i knew i wasnt noise cancelling phones. i recommend getting other headphones"
3,do it BIG!,"These headphones are good but they are way too big for the soun they deliver. I guess sony was counting on the fact that alot of people will believe bigger is better. The bass response sounds good, The quality of sound is great but not very loud for the size of the headphones. They coul be half the size but they look extremely good. For twenty dollars I can't complain. I just don't want you to think these are loud because their big."
3,give more description,it's not what a 78 year od male thought he requested. sellers should explain what it is usefull for as to all young people probably know. shouldn't assume something. i needed a headphone for my viera panasonic tv of which i finally bought fom amazon. i am attempting to use the XD200 with my pc viewing crackle and i will eventually find out how it works.
3,not worth $59.95,"I bought the sony mdr-xd200s almost 2 years ago. the grey plastic gave them a very cheap appearance. i didn't mind too much because the price was much lower back then ( a little over $20). i'm no sound engineer so i can't give a detailed description of the sound quality, but i will say that it was more than adequate for my novice ears. it was as better than most other $20 headphones i've had over the years. unfortunately one of the earcups broke off. that's never happened to me before, and considering i don't even use the headphones that often i was pretty unhappy about it. it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. i was looking for a pair to replace it and came across the JVC HARX700. Theses headphones are great and are over $20 dollars cheaper. I would not buy the mdr-xd200s at the current price. there are much better options that cost less money."
1,Cheap,"The sound quality is good, but unfortunately they are extremely uncomfortable after about an hour because there is no padding on the top strap. Also, mine straight up stopped working after less than a year."
3,not very quieting,"i thought these were going to be better made by sony. they were cheap though, so i guess i got what i paid for."
4,One small problem....,"I guess I didn't read carefully enough before purchase... everything's great, but the cord is about 10 feet long! I have to keep it wound up or I'd trip over it all the time. I don't use them for walking around, but if anyone thinks that these are grab-and-go headphones or thinks they'd be useful at the gym... think again."
5,best headphones ever,we have gone through a lot of headphones in this house & these r by far the best & most comfortable ones yet.
4,"Great product, with very few holdback","very high definition sound quality. Very reasonable,even cheap, price, but there are still some holdback in this product. It looks very breakable, and plastic material seems very cheaply made. It looks like I could ""accidentally"" break it anytime, if I was not careful.But overall, it is a great product to buy at very low price. Highly recommended!"
5,Great price for Product balance,"I paid around 20 dollars for it and im very pleased for the quality it has i mean, i didnt wanted to spend 100 dollars or more to get a high quality headphon and for 20 bucks this is great"
4,Great but not perfect,"Since it only costs about twenty bucks, the quality of the headphones are great. kinda uncomfortable around the top area. after about an hour, start to get a headache. not really made for glasses ppl."
4,Great headphones,"Buying headphones nowadays is very risky, since you expect so much from them and for a low price. These are considered great headphones IMO. They have a few select-able modes for movie/music which is cool. They sound great! Obviously, the more you dish out for headphones, the more features/better-sound you'll get. But these are good in their own right. If you want headphones under $50 I'd definitely go with these."
3,"decent sound, difficult to manage","these headphones are really only good for home usage. they sound great but are huge and cumbersome. they do not sit on the neck comfortably and are not flexible at all. they may be good for some people, for example, use at an office or for watching a movie, but i was not able to keep mine because i need to use them portably and they do not have that feature. otherwise, for the price, the sound is great."
1,don't buy these,These headphones fit too loosely on your head and the sound quality especially bass is bad. Buy the koss ones from Walmart instead
5,Nice headphones,"After several months since I bought these headphones I could say I have no complaints. The sound quality is maybe no the best among some other choices but It fulfill its purpose. The item is very comfortable and flexible, it feels very light when you wear it."
4,Comfort & very clear.,"Great sound & very comfortable, I drive for a living & drive for aprox. 11 hours a day. I wear them aprox. 9 hours a day & have no problem with anything. I listen to these using my iPhone, the sound is very clear, u can hear every little sound which I like. The bass does not over power the mids or highs which is great for me. Oh remember I drive a Semi Tractor Trailer & the noise in side the cab is loud, but these head phone does a great job of keeping it out. Great Deal for the price. Very Happy!"
3,Oversized,Maybe it's just me but this are really oversized. And everytime I used them I ended up with headache or pain in my ears.
4,Good overall,"If you're looking for super-high-quality sound, these won't be a good choice, but for casual listening, they're great. No bells and whistles - just a decent, reliable set of headphones. And they're comfortable, so that's cool too."
5,OMFG,"So much better than desktop speakers, and the so called HiFi headphones I currently have are now collecting dust somewhere."
5,Comfortable and Pretty good sound Quality,I use them with my laptop and they block out a good portion of noise going on around you. They are comfortable and the cord is pretty long for most needs. A good buy.
5,Great sound!,"I'm not an audiophile, but I find the MDR-XD200 to be a great set of headphones for the price. I also have a set of Etymotic Research 6i ear buds, which also sound amazing, and the MDR-XD200 headphones sound just as good. I mainly listen to music with them."
4,Still good after a couple years,"I have had these for about 3 years, the first year it was barely used, now it is used regularly with an onboard sound card, I know the headset is hardly being stressed since the onboard cannot power them properly. I ordered aASUS PCI 5.1 Channel Sound Card XONAR_DGto try and push them properly. The sound is still very clear, crisp and bassy.The black rubber? material on the pads are peeling, but the foam is still totally intact. I am gentle with them and expect them to last a long time."
5,Fantastic Present,"I got these Headphones for my boyfriend for Christmas. He absolutely loves them. They have excellent sound quality. These headphones do a supreme job of blocking out sound from your surroundings. Also the Amp accessory that comes with the headphones is a major plus, and will be used frequently. Form fitting, and comfortable. Very well made. Overall Fantastic. :]"
2,Ben,"Not great. the bass isnt good, to much money,and they make u look like an alien. they are huge. Defiantly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. mdrxb500 are great but expensive. and for 20 buks, the best headphones are ihome over ears.[...]and now its 13.99 AMAZING!!!"
5,Best headphones I've had ... for the price,"I can crank these and my sound card up all the way and still not hear any noise, which is amazing. The bass response is pretty good, but it seems to overdo it sometimes.Towards the end of long sessions wearing them, they get uncomfortable, but the first few hours is fine.There's basically no noise isolation, which is good for some people, bad for others.I've had more comfortable headphones, that were more adjustable, sounded better, and had noise isolation. They costed several times as much, though.The movie/music switches on mine don't seem to do anything."
3,Only $20,"It can be slight discomfort if you do not put on the headphones properly.There is a good amount of noise cancellation but for $20, you can't expect complete noise cancellation.The plastic seems a bit cheap and flimsy. I do not think these headphones are meant to be roughed up."
2,How do these have 4 stars?,"These things squeak. Every time I move my head, even just a little, my ears are filled with a loud plastic-on-plastic squeak. They are uncomfortable, with little adjustability, and the sound is mediocre at best. But I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Headphone lasted three years,"Three years later, it died. For the price, I guess it did its job.The switches on the headphone are completely USELESS. There is no sound difference! It is a lie."
2,Specs incorrect - 11ft Cable NOT 3 ft,"Sound quality is great, but it's a mess of headphone wire. At 11ft long it's a mess of cable everywhere. The specs say 3' so I was pretty disappointed."
2,Expected much better...,"Well.. I saw someone having these, and I fell in love with the design and etc...I ordered them, and found that they are uncomfortable to wear, your heads needs be like a square to be able to put them on properly, and when you put them on your head looks like a square... Also... when you listen to music/watching videos, the sound is good but when you stop there is like some sound waves that you hear from the headphones, but the music is off... and that's really annoying... maybe I got a broken pair or something...BY THE WAY: I received my package in a box, inside a box was special plastic box where the headphones were in, and on the back it was half peeled off.. but everything was in its place... so I got my headphones they were half open....I gave it 2 starts for the design, I love the design.. but Im having problems with my headphones....I hope I can return these..."
2,Yet another pair of headphones.,"Very disappointing. I've heard better from less expensive Sony 'phones.1. Voices have a ""cupped-hands"" sound.2. Generally sounds as though every instrument is inside a plastic container.3. Highest frequencies are muddled. No real definition there.The good points are few. Two of which are:1. Decent matching between drivers. Very solid middle-of-the-head imaging.2. Subtle midrange sounds are easily heard.I don't grade audio by the cost. If it's good, then it's GOOD. The MDR-XD200s in my possession are not."
3,great for the money,"not the best headphones I've had but still great for the price. dont like the ""plastic"" feeling and the sound is kind of dull. comfortable fit. not bad over all."
5,I like them a lot,"I was looking for a gift for my boyfriend and came across these. I read the great reviews and decided to take a chance. I was really surprised when he first put them on and said ""these actually sound really good."" I got some for my self too and they are very comfortable. I wear glasses and the headphones don't get in the way of that at all. Ive only used them around the house so I haven't experienced a whole lot of outside noise with them on. The cord is long, like 11ft or something. I just wrap it up to a decent length, it's kind of handy when you want to walk around but not take off your headphones. Overall I really like these headphones, nice sound and really comfortable."
4,Great headphones for the price.,"These replaced an older set of Sony headphones. Overall a nice set for the money.Pro: Very comfortable. Sound quality is good for the price.Con: Cable is very long. Much longer than any headphone setI have ever had. Use mostly with PC, so don't really need thatmuch and tends to get in the way. Cable is also much thinnerthan previous sets that I have owned."
5,AMAZING,"I got these so I could watch movies/listen to music with my roommate in the room (also my laptop speakers are crap). This works wonderfully. The sound quality is BEAUTIFUL. Also, the cord is extremely long, so I can leave my laptop on my bed and prepare something to eat at the minifridge on the other side of the room whilst still listening to whatever I'm watching (I live in a dorm). It was perfect, maybe better, for my needs. And priced great!"
3,Okay for Home Use,"Bought these thinking they would be cheap and awesome. The picture makes the phones look expensive and well made but when you see it in person, it looks very frail and seems to be made of cheap plastic. I'm an audiophile but not as extreme as others and these just don't have the stuff I want. Everything is crystal clear and would work well for listening to music on the go but the sound leaks REALLY BAD. The only reason why I don't give these a 4 or 5 star is because of the bass. I'm heavy on bass and these phones are weak in that area. If you just want something to listen to casually, go ahead and buy these. I would recommend going for the pricier stuff if you're serious about your music"
2,"Too big, not a good sound","It appears to be smaller on picture, but once you have it then you realize it's too big, not confortable, and the sound quality is not good."
3,Pretty Good,"These headphones are supremely comfortable and have a extremely conveniently long cord. Unfortunately if what you're listening to gets too loud the drivers heavily distort. Thankfully the audio has to be really loud for this but it wasn't an issue for the older, cheaper Sony headphones these replaced."
5,Amazing Headphones!,"Pros : Great Headphones, Great Sound Quality, Looks Cool, Comfortable, Fits any Head, Light-weight.Cons : Very Long Cord.These are the best headphones that I have ever experienced. The Sound Quality is amazing. The Bass is just right. Especially in Movie-mode, I enjoy my dubstep and the flow is almost like you're in a movie theater. They are extremely comfortable. The cushion fits any ear perfectly and it is soft too. The Loudness is on the meeker side. However, it is just enough.The cord is insanely long. That maybe a problem. But, otherwise, these are a great pair of headphones for everyday use."
5,Excellent Quality!,These headphones are really fantastic. The cord is extra long so you can easily plug them into a guitar amp and have room to move around (which is what I originally bought them for). Now I use them for most everything including listening to music and watching TV shows on my computer. They're really comfy and the sound quality is outstanding. Well worth the price since they are not that expensive. I would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone and everyone.
4,Nice?,"Just got my headphones. They fit great, feel really good against my head and ears. I wear glasses so studio headphones can be uncomfortable. The headphones have a Music/Movies switch on each ear and I can't notice a difference in quality when switching. Also the switch feels very cheap. Other than that the headphones are great."
5,Excellent and Well Priced,"These headphones have an excellent sound quality for the price. It has a deep bass that, in my opinion, is well balanced with the highs and lows. I play bass guitar, so I tent to enjoy a bass that is a little more pronounced rather then being subdued. The headphones themselves, while large in size, are comfortable and durable. My wife stretched them to their limits to place this on her belly so our soon-to-be-born son can listen, and there was no damage or stretching on the part of the headphones. After having used earbuds for so long, I am amazed at the nuances in my music and movies that I can hear with these headphones. Great job Sony!"
1,"Good sound quality, horrible design flaws","While these are comfortable and produce decent sound, they are made of cheap plastics and are not worth the money unless you like hearing squeaking, creaking and cracking noises of the plastic parts every time you move your head. The noise coming from the random parts of these headphones renders them useless.Sony products are usually reliable, but whoever designed these should have been more careful when picking materials. I understand that they needed to lower production cost to make them affordable, but this design flaw is simply unacceptable when it comes to headphones... there are cheap plastics that do not make noise. I mean, you wouldn't buy a TV that randomly flashes lights at you, would you?"
4,It works for me,The set is large but not uncomfortably so. The only real trouble is figuring out how to carry around a 2-meter cord easily.
5,GREAT BUY: 8 Years of Friendship and Respect.,"As far as $20 goes, I think these are the best of the best.I have had a pair for 8 years, use them constantly to check mixes and track in the studio (although the sound bleed can be bad).I have beat them to death. The cord is frayed and has been runover hundreds of times, the seal is super weak after years of abuse,They are great for a more detailed listen to an iPod or laptop.BUT THEY STILL WORK, STILL SOUND PHENOMENAL, and I trust them over headphones that cost a lot more.Way better sound than many headphones and earbuds at twice the cost.Way better (sound and comfort) than Sony's Studio Monitor line at the same cost.ONLY CON (ignorable for the price):Not the MOST adjustable set of headphones, and after some wear and tear the seal will get loose."
4,Good headphones,"These are pretty good headphones. There is some crackling and distortion at moderate volumes, but overall they sound great and fit great."
4,Good voice quality,"I used it to listen to audio courses and some movies. I liked the quality, does not harm your ears, the wire is long enough.One issue you may not like, It has huge ears."
4,muy comodos y se ajusta a tu modo de utilizarlos,"los audifonos sony son muy bueno y suenan duro practicos lo recomiendo el envio fue rapido el vendedor serio ,"
5,These were excatly what I was looking for,I chose this rating because it goes along with how I feel about this product. I love this product because it fits great and its just about the only pair of headphones that fit my head! I would deffitnitly reccomend this to a friend or family member.
2,Meh,"From the size of these things you would think that exceptional sound production would come along with it, wrong ! These headphones produce sub-par sound quality at best and you can find exceptionally better ones for just that are in the same price range. The bass wasn't as great as I thought it would be and the wire is just ridiculously long. The headphones feel cheap (which they are) and is flimsy. If you pay $50.00 or even $30.00 for these headphones you will be disappointed. At the most these headphones should actually cost $ 15.00. This is not the quality I expected from Sony. I do not recommend these headphones for those who want high quality sound from their music."
4,Sony MDR-XD200 Headphones,"Got these for my boyfriend who plays guitar and listens to a lot of music while working and doing chores. The cord on these is extremely long, so beware, we usually end up looking like clowns trying to find the end when picking them up. His old pair of headphones weren't cutting it for recording tracks onto his laptop or even just listening to some songs on his Zune. These fit his needs perfectly and so far he loves them. They fit his head comfortably, the pads don't make his ears hurt and the sound is awesome. I put them on when he was explaining the switches (I think something like music and movie are the switch options) and you can definitely hear a difference in the bass, movie is made to get the most out of all the explosions and other loud sound effects. So far, so good with these."
4,good sound but could use a few improvements.,good headphones overall. i will give it an 7 out 10 for sound quality. The headphones bass is great but do short out in some cases.Anyway if you just looking for travel/home use headphones these headphones will suit you just fine. :))))))))))))))))))))Happy New Years12/31/11
3,"Gift is appreciated, but far from ideal","I bought these Sony XD200 headphones as a gift for my daughter, she wanted over the ear type headphones so she can watch videos on her laptop without disturbance from other sounds (like us). She likes them, however, I should have read the other reviews more carefully before buying these, as several reviewers mentioned how large they are, and they aren't adjustable in width. Even on my large head, they don't fit very tightly. These headphones are only suitable for watching videos or listening to music while still or seated, they would not stay on your head if you were moving around much.They do sound very good for such inexpensive headphones, but the construction quality is only moderate at best, and the cord is 10 feet long which is not what the specification says on Amazon. Overall, she is happy, which is all that matters to me."
4,Time Saver,Substance flow from dispenser is not very consistent but this can save you a lot of trouble nonetheless. It's especially useful for repairing fried traces on compact circuit boards.
2,my pen arrived dead,My pen arrived to my home dead/dry but the company i ordered from gladly give me my refund so im happy it was easily obtained otherwise im sure this product would have worked
1,3 words...Does Not Work,"You might as well use a piece of a plastic bag to connect points. Tried every way I could to get it to be conductive. drawing a line on a circuit board and letting it dry, drawing a line and baking it as directed to ""cure it"" I even tried to see if it was conductive little copper circle to little copper circle on a board with the copper on it.It may work for itty-bitty breaks on a drefroster on your back window, but as for it being some way of conducting from point A to B forget it.I cannot believe I wasted my money, could have bought 3 spools of 22 gauge wire for less @ Radio Shack for the price of basically nothing. Just a bag of ""magic beans"" when it comes to living up to description."
4,"For me is a very good product, but it dries too quick.","I use this for a couple of years from now. Is a good product, I often use it to revive old remotes, gamepads and cellular keypads, you can brush the old conductor finish with a mid abrasive eraser and then apply a coat of this, the contact behaves as new again. The only complain is than the ink inside the marker dries too quick in the tube, I almost lost one third of the content on every market I have, I wish I know how to dilute them without damage or loss the conductive properties, I need to run this test with various alcohols, tupertine or solvents."
3,Part 1 of the circuit Track review.,"The purpose:Remake a keyboard Printed circuit.Result : I'm typing on it.Problem: After taking all the precautions indicated on the Writer and the sealer I ended up developing my own method and redoing the tracks up to 5 times to get it right.Root Cause: The pin tip are still too thick to work well and the plastic the keyboard circuit is printed on. The trace just short circuits other traces.Solution: Do the trace then use alcohol ,cotton and a pen to clear out the extras."
4,Works as advertised,Just be careful not to over-ink the bits you're filling in: the conductive ink starts out verrrrrrrrrrrrrrry liquid.
2,Only for short lengths,"I was hoping to draw the majority of the circuit I was making to connect 50 LEDs in parallel on an unprinted circuit board. The connections worked okay, but the further the LEDs were from the power source, the dimmer they got. There must be too much filler between the silver particles increasing the resistance. Probably okay for patching broken connections, but don't count on making a whole circuit from it."
3,Not... Mamet's...top,This play is certainly different than his usual tension and f-bomb filled other ones. It intrigued me but didn't dazzle me. It is a much tougher sell and would be curious to see it performed and see what else would come to life than what is given on the page.
4,Baseball -- like fathers and sons -- never gets old,"The theme of fathers and sons reconnecting through baseball is growing more common, from WP Kinsella's ""Shoeless Joe"" to the new classic ""Waiting for Teddy Williams"" by Howard Frank Mosher. But Jerry Amernic has thrown us a curve with ""Gift of the Bambino,"" united a son and grandfather through baseball and the sport's most recognizable icon, Babe Ruth. And his results are touching, insightful and often uproarious. Baseball fans will be delighted, but so will fans of stories told with flourish and grace.Buy this book now, if only because it's difficult to find on chain-booksellers' shelves. To me, a book without the predictable, headlong, simplistic storytelling of today's mass-market books is a gem, and finding it is part of the reward."
1,crock pot,The slow cooker came damaged. I waited longer than the 7 day return policy to notify the seller. My loss.
5,Stickers with a place to put them other than your little brother!!,"My 2 year old grandaughter loves this & it was one of her favorite Christmas gifts. She's always loved stickers, but the concept of having a separate page to match the sticker with the shape is great----so much better than the sliding glass door, or your knee or her 1 year old brother!! It's really like solving a puzzle to find the correct shape to put the sticker on---great idea!!"
3,Pretty Princesses,"I do believe that this item is called Disney Princess Ultimate Sticker Book because the pictures now have glitter. It does not seem to refer to an unusually large number of gowns and tiaras for the Disney ladies.To be fair, I think it should have had something more to warrant that Ultimate tag. However, it is a toy that will keep a youngster busy for qute some time. I mean, what's more fun for a girley-girl than playing with princesses?So, if this sounds like the kind of toy your daughter loves, then it is worth the monehy."
1,Don't bother,I purchased this for my daughter's birthday. I'm sending it back because it is not worth the 6.99. What a waste of money. Just a few pages of stickers and the page count includes the back of the sticker pages that are blank. Don't bother.
4,Princess,My five year old granddaughter Kiana thinks she is a princess and of course the whole family agrees. I bought her this sticker book of Disney Princesses. She was so excited about it. It was well constructed and a pleasure to work with. I could not have be4en happier.
1,Disgusting!,"I was tricked into watching this Anime. It aired on one of the Stars networks on Animation night. At first I thought it was an ok Anime, but as they got deeper into it, it's a homosexual love story. Completely disgusting. There's a scene where one of the guys tries to rape the main character. I haven't watched anything after that, I stopped right there."
3,Retractable - Sometimes,"You have to hit the buttons just right in order to retract them. I bought this and it wouldn't work right, so I ordered a replacement from Amazon (which, by the way was a painless process). I received the second ones and they are better at retracting.Sound quality is very good.Cord that goes around the back of the head could be a little longer."
2,"Good for a while, but will break","Decent headphones for sitting and walking. Definitely not good for exercise, as they'll fall right off. The retractable cord mechanism broke after 9 months. Now the cord won't stay out."
5,No more tangled cords,"Great sound quality for inexpensive headphones. Much more comfortable then any earbuds, and the retractable cord allows for easy storage."
3,Awesome sound - if you hold them close to your ears.,"I have an old pair of Philips headphones and haven't seen prices lately so was quite shocked when I visited Target. Long story short - I bought all of the ones between $10-30 and none of them matched the quality of my old beat-up cheap Philips except these, but only when I held them just right against my head. I LOVE the retractable feature - worked fine for me, no problems - except the main cord was about a foot too short for me (hooking into desktop speakers @ work)."
1,Not for any sort of activity,"I returned these for headphones that are actually built for humans. I ran about 10 steps with these on and they started to fall off. These would be great if you had nothing else to do with your hands except hold them on your ears. If you couldn't figure out, I rate fitment a 1. Overall sound would be much better if you stuck your head in a vice to keep pressure on both ears. Found retractable cord nice, but too sensitive, with any kind of movement it tends to retract randomly without pushing the buttons. Stylish yes, functional absolutely NOT!!!"
4,The sound is good but....,"The retractable cord doesn't work after almost 2 months.And the cord is weak too, the right side of the headset doesn't work and I sent the thing back to SONY.But overall, if it's in warrenty(which is only 90 days), the product is good for its price and quality. I have a Q22LW , Q66LW and a NC11A. I'd still like the Q66 the most because of its comparatively higher sound quality. By the way, there's not much difference if you just use it for i-pod since the sound quality from the machine is bad..."
2,Romance Killed Too Soon,"I actually had no problem with the clip design; in fact, I exercised with the headphones on all the time. I loved these headphones to death. The retractable cord was certainly a space-saver, too. The only thing I disliked was that the sound wasn't too great and leaked easily. However, less than 7 months later, the right side just stopped working. A day after that, the left side died. Needless to say, the headphones are now garbage. It's not worth the money. Don't buy it. Sony is just a really, really crappy company that makes profit only because of its name."
1,Decent quality if only they'd stay on my ears,"I bought this pair of headphones because I wanted a change from the iPod in-ears and I was attracted to the cool design and retractable cords. However, when I put them on, I feel like they're flapping around my ears even when I just move my head around. I also tried using them when I had glasses on and that just made it worse. Also, the sound leaks out quite a bit especially because they don't fit tightly over they ear but just hang loosely over them. I wouldn't recommend these headphones unless you can listen to music while using your hands to hold the headphones in place."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought these earphones because I do a lot of cardio and my ears sometimes start hurting from having the earphones in my ear for an hour or more at a time and thought this would be a nice change. However, I could not get these earphones to stay securely on my ears while running or even doing stairmaster. They were the most fustrating earphones I have ever had in my life. I fought with them for about a month and right when I decided I couldn't do it any longer, the right one shorted out on me and they don't even work anymore. I wouldn't recommend these earphones to anyone!"
2,"Ok, not an air cooler, more of a fan","The reviews on this item should have tipped me off as they are so mixed. This is really just a fan, I bought it to cool my small one bedroom apartment (just the small bedroom) and it is just a fan, if you are looking for an air conditioner, keep looking, this isn't it. Repeat, it is NOT a portable air conditioner."
2,Do not buy,"I bought this last year for my basement. It worked the first year as long as you put it directly in front of you. However this year it is not blowing as well. I stored it properly over the winter, but now it is just sitting in the corner taking up space. Price is reasonable if you have money to give away."
2,"Dont buy it, if you are looking for cool air.","I had bought this and had to return it within 3 days. The product claims to cool the air near it and blow cool air when kept closer to you, but it just did not do anything..not even when your face was right in front of the fan.. I had a table fan and this cooler and both were doing the same job. Loaded up the thing with Ice, iced water etc etc... but still the same.. Called up customer care, which responded well but they concluded that nothing is technically wrong with it. Finally ended up returning it back..Keep a wet cloth on your table fan or use this thing... both are same.. I would prefer the table fan instead."
2,not worth it,"I bought this cooler last summer out of desperation. I live in colorado springs and don't have a/c. Living here it is not a necessity. But there are probably 3 or 4 wks worth of hot summer days that are painfully hot in a young neighborhood with no shade trees.Enter the SPT Portable Evaporative Air Cooler.I had high hopes. I meet all the requirements. I wasn't expecting the air in my bedroom to miraculously become frigid. Colorado air is dry thus making evaporative cooling methods effective. I was just looking for a little drop in the room temp when I try to fall asleep at night.I followed all of the instructions, I filled it with ice... and I waited for slight relief. And I continued to wait as I tossed and turned allllllll night long. And the next night. And the next night.Save your money, an oscillating fan is more effective."
2,lower air conditioning bills;beware of hard water,"This evap cooler is easy to fill and move around. I keep a gallon wide mouth thermos full of water in the freezer and add to the cooler just before the water freezes. Product will not cool down even a small room, but is effective in temperatures below 95 degrees to keep a person comfortable if the air is blowing directly from a short distance (4 or 5 feet away). It is very quiet on the low fan setting and perfect for sleeping without the use of air conditioning. Probably only effective in low humidity conditions such as my use in Phoenix.(additional after 1 month of use) After 3 weeks of use, the cooling effect slowlydiminished until there was no cooling at all and the unit did not consume any water. I was told by customer service that the calcium and magnesium in my Phoenix hard water created mineral deposits that stopped the water pump from working."
4,Great product for the price,After suffering an extra harsh summer in Northern NJ we realized that we absolutely had to get something. This looked like a decent fit which is portable and not too expensive. Its a great product for the price and does the job effectively for a small or medium sized room. Haven't really tried it out on a large room but it works well for us and our needs.
4,preforms up to expectations,"I live in Colorado, this is a dry climate. Evaporative coolers work well here.I like to sleep with lots of blankets on, I just find it more comfortable. This past summer, I used this in my bedroom to keep the temperature cool enough that I could sleep with a spread and blanket on. It was able to keep the area around my bed below 70, and I slept much better because of it. The included remote is nice to be able to set a sleep timer, or simply start the oscillator when it's not quite aimed right. Only complaint is that pouring water in too quickly can cause it to splash out of the chute."
4,"Don't expect greatness, but it helps a bit","It's one step up from a portable fan. Don't expect a dramatic temperature change. It helps for spot cooling, though, like when working while sitting. Do remember that this will only work in dry climates; it's only going to make things worse otherwise.The wheels make the cooler live up to its name (""portable""), especially when it's full with water. It doesn't really help to put ice water in the main tank. We didn't try putting a large block of ice in the extra slot on top, but that might help."
1,thieves,Recebroken 2 places made a mess in house more work waste of time DO NOT BUY FROMived item found pan
3,had problems,It leaked when I filled it with much water. My husband had to take it apart and fix a broken hose. By the time all of this was done the hot weather was over and I didn't ever really use it. The company did send us a new hose to replace it with.
4,okay for the price swamp cooler,I live in the San Fernando Valley of L.A. and the warm summer months that have peak temps of 103 - 105F and evening temps of 84 - 86F can leave you with sleepless nights assuming you don't use an a.c. in the bedroom. Turning up the swamp cooler at high speed inside the well ventilated bedroom keeps the temp cooler at 75F into the night if the outside temp is around 80 - 84F and the relative humidity is 35% and below. I would recommend this model also because of its value for money price and also since it wouldn't cost you an arm and a leg compared to using a window-type a.c.
2,Its okay,"I live in Colorado Springs and bought this because there is no AC in our house and the summers get pretty hot (lately). This is a glorified fan. I've added ice water and used ice packs but the fan temp doesn't really get more than a couple degrees below the room temp. When its 90 in my house, I prefer it to be 77, not 88. I would just buy a window unit and call it a day if I were you."
2,Don't waste money,This does not cool as I expected. I wouldn't waste money on this unit. I have other brand that cools much better than this.
1,Don't waste your money,"I read the reviews, purchased the product, and am not pleased with the results.First, I believe a large fan would do more good. A lot more good. When you have hot and humid days, it is not a good idea to use an air cooler that bases its cooling on cycling water vapor; (i.e., more humidity). I do not recommend this for people or pets. My regular fans are working better in trying to cool down the 100F+ days. At night it is okay-- but no good for the true heat. Don't waste your money. Buy a big fan."
1,Refrigerator Carton Cooler,"Save your money. The only possible cooling you may get from this unit is if you have a refrigerator carton you can get in, (ask your kids) and take this ""cooler"" with you. This unit would benefit greatly from liquid nitrogen cooling. Of the two units, only one arrived undamaged. The unit is fairly quiet, except when the 'SWEEP' is turned on. Then, it sounds like someone in the room rocking on an old rocking chair."
1,Bad,Does not do what it suppose to do and they take forever to refund you your money back. I would recommend just getting the air conditioner you get and install in your window. That is for sure it will work. There $79 at Target for a window air conditioner.
2,Waste,"I live in Arizona where its dry people say this works in dry places honestly no difference if i know what i know now i wouldnt have paid $15 bucks for this ur better off just spending three to four hundred bucks for a air cooler the only good thing about this unit is that it is quiet cause the motor doesnt push air, the high speed felt like a low air speed low was almost off.."
1,"Doesn't work, save yourself the money",It just blows air. Better to buy a fan and it does not reduce the temperature by even 1 degree. Save yourself the money and buy 4 or 5 fans for the price of this one item.
1,don't buy it,"I purchased this one last august and used it several times then the weather got cooler. I just put it in my living room during the winter. This year, I just used it for several time and then it stopped working. It is still within its product warranty period. I contacted the sales and nobody responded. For those who are going to buy sth to blow cooler air,pls don't bother yourself buying this one. Besides, I think it just works like a fan, not something like air conditioning which can cooling down the air temperature."
4,"Great product, great company","This is a great cooling system for the price. It's quiet enough that you can have it running while you're watching TV and not have to crank the volume all the way up. Also, the company that makes the air cooler is easy to work with as well. If there happens to be something wrong with the system, they'll replace it BEFORE you even send back your original system, so you don't have to go without. Very nice and a lot of bang for your buck! Side note, I live in a non-humid climate, which helps how well it works."
4,Portable and easy,"My wife and I were looking for a portable unit that would cool us off a bit in the afternoon and especially while we slept; one that was cost effective and affordable. We've been using the SPT SF-608R for about two months now and it's been good. Doesn't get as cold as we'd hoped, but it is not an air conditioner; it uses evaporation to lower the temperature - the addition of ice quite increases its effectiveness.It is easy to move around, it is very easy to use and it definitely takes the edge off. We're satisfied with the purchase and happy to have it around.In fact, it's getting hot in here so I'm going to go turn it on right now..."
4,Inexpensive cooling,"First off, this is NOT an air conditioner. If you expect your room to be freezing cold, this is not the product for you. It's a COOLER, and it does its job very well. It works by evaporating water. Try soaking a T-shirt, wringing it out, and putting it on wet to get the effect. It doesn't work very well in humid areas, but it works GREAT where the air is dry.I'm in southern California, where the humidity varies pretty widely. I place the cooler six or eight feet from my chair, and on the hottest days I'm quite comfortable.Benefits:* it's about 1/5 the cost of an air conditioner* operating expense is a fraction of the cost of air conditioning* neat features! (timer, sleep function, etc.)* remote controlDrawbacks:* it's not freezing cold like air conditioning."
3,Okay......but not excellent,"We live in the heart of the desert in Nevada, and bought this as a way to cool individual rooms in the house vs. letting the central air cool the whole house. Why bother cooling the whole house when the family is together in one room for long periods of time?We have a thermometer and hydrometer in the primary room we use it in. The room is about 400 sq ft. and we run it for hours. For coolness, it only gives us a 1-degree temp difference; sometimes 2-degrees with ice cold water, and ice cubes in both the main water chamber and top of unit.The big difference we notice is with the humidity. We run about 20% humidity in the room normally. With this unit, it increases to 35-40% humidity. This helps with the dryness and with our allergies/asthma.Overall, we use it more as a humidifier, but it does help us to increase the thermostat a few degrees at night when we run it in the bedroom, which saves a little on energy costs."
4,Swamp Cooler,"This thing actually saved my life. Living in a city where they claim ""air conditioning is not necessary"", I almost lost it on that fluke week of 90 degrees! The room does have a damp feel to it if you run with the cooler for a long time, but MUCH better than the alternative. Also, with the cooler, (female talking here) my skin is 10X better due to it not being dry. My new kitten and I thank Amazon for getting us through the HEAT, for a great purchase, great price and shipping RIGHT ON TIME AS USUAL!"
4,We love it!,"We're very happy with the air cooler. It really functions as a higher powered, cooler fan, it's not like an air conditioner at all. We primarily use it in a very large space with a small window unit air conditioner & a ceiling fan. The combination of the 3 keeps the place feeling cool. We've recommended it to several friends & may order more for the bedrooms."
2,Get an air conditioner if you don't want to be hot!,I thought maybe this would work for me as I have a small place. It works well as a fan and that's about it. I felt no change in air temp no matter how much ice and cold water I added. Not worth the money.
1,"it don,t work","the one i get don't work. the fan works, but the pump not. the water never get to the top and circulate.it works like a expensive fan.maybe i am not lucy one, the pump weak for the job. but it happened to me. i returned it back. i have to say, the way to returned is easy at amazon."
1,doesn't work,"The ""cooler"" only cools if you sit right in front of it, otherwise it makes the rest of the room hotter than a regular fan because of the moisture/humidity that it puts into the air. It's 95 degrees outside but I open the door to let the cooler outside air into the room to remove the hot humid air. I'm trying to return it now."
1,Dissappointed,I bought this item but it doesn't work in my house. My room is bigger so I tried it in my daughters room which is much smaller in size and it didn't work at all. It doesn't cool the room even with closed windows and doors. I returned the item and my search for portable air conditioner continues.
1,Awful!! Do Not by this product,"Since I received this item, I was not satisfied at all! I put a negative feedback and a person named Tim called back saying that he would take care of this matter in no time if I removed the negative feedback, since then me and my husband have tried that number several times per day during the last three days and no response from vendor. E-mailed again and no answer. I want my money back now!!!"
3,"Not an air conditioner, but works OK","I live in Southern California and having had a very hot summer I decided to get this product. The fact that it used hardly any energy was what appealed to me. However, I was a little annoyed to find out that it really only works when the humidity is below 40% RH. You will also need adequate ventilation. Even if you are able to meet those requirements the air coming out is really only about 10 degrees cooler than the surrounding air. That is not very much, especially considering that the highest fan speed is not that high. The fact you have to add water and ice is a pain. So, basically speaking, if the room you want to cool is REALLY hot (like 90 degrees) you need a regular air conditioner, as this unit can only lower the temperature about 5 degrees at its best. Still, it can be useful on hot and dry days."
3,Great w/ an addtl. fan but water is a hassle to change.,It gets really hot in our S. Californian Apt (no air conditioner) and I bought this to help with that.. It does lower the air temperature by about 3-4 degrees with straight tap water. The only problem is it's not easy to drain this unit & it has to be drained or water changed every 2 days. The fan aspect works okay at blowing cool air at the spot it's set to. I recommend using this in conjunction with another fan like a Lasko and you will cool the room even more. That's how I use it and it works!
1,simply doesn't work,"just doesn't work. we live in a very dry climate. just doesn't work. i tried many speeds, different settings. i didn't try it with ice, but i was hoping (perhaps foolishly) that it would work. but will keep it for use as a humidifier."
1,NOT A COOLER,"As pointed out by many other reviews here, the product does not cool. Well, maybe 1 or 2 degrees. But it is more like a humidifier rather than a cooler.Very disappointed, will look into returning it if not too late."
3,Not impressed but not disappointed,"I live in Denver and do not have a/c in my condo, so I wanted to find something that would be a little less expensive. I tend to like to be a bit warm but if I'm too warm I really have a hard time sleeping. I read some reviews stating that this cooler worked well in dry climates so I thought it would work for me. I was expecting to cool my bedroom off a bit at night but wasn't looking for an a/c or something to cool my entire condo. I've found that this cooler works well as a fan moreso than as a cooler. It really doesn't cool the overall temperature in my bedroom but it is nice to blow air like a fan and I imagine I'm getting some benefit from the humidifying affect, I'm just not noticing it since it's summer maybe. In any case, it seems to work okay and I do put ice in the water to help, but it certainly won't cool a space, just a person."
2,Not what I hoped for.,"I live in Southern Utah and it is very hot and dry. I like my bedroom to be cold at night and I hoped that I could use this to cool the bedroom and turn the central air in the rest of the house up. Well, I turned it on high when I got it and had a thermometer in the room and let it run with and without a window open. The air never went down even 1 degree even after 1 hour running. Another reviewer mentioned that it only has a net that the water runs over and I don't think that covers enough area to really cool. It is quieter than the next one I ordered. That one didn't cool my room either so maybe a evaporative cooler just isn't what I need. I ended up ordering a portable air conditioner but am so thankful for Amazon's return policy. There was one of the louvers that wasn't moving but I figured that if I kept it, I would have been able to snap it back into place."
1,Item stopped working a few days after the return date ran out.,I bought two of these. They did seem to cool. One of them stopped working within a week of when the return date expired. I am a bit disappointed as I gave it to my daughter-in-law as a birthday present.
2,Didn't meet expectation,"It was a little bigger than I thought it would be. The air did feel somewhat cool, but the fan itself , at the highest speed, was very disappointing. It did not work for me, so I will return it soon."
2,"It works,,, thats it.","This cooler has not met my expectations. I don't think my expectations are too high. The cooler does have a decent blower and it does function properly. It just doesn't really cool a room. I did follow the directions and inserted the ice/water. While generating some moisture in the room, it pretty much stopped there. For me, its a very expensive fan."
1,dont waste your money,"I live in central Arizona and am used to using swamp coolers - this one does not qualify as such. It has a tissue thin evaperator pad that soon as you put the unit next to a window the heat over powers the pad - it might be usefull as a humidifier, but as a cooler forget it."
4,cooler,liked this item so ordered another one the same day. it is quiet but puts out a decent amount of air even on low. MR
2,Waste of money,"This was an absolute waste of money. I bought this based on favorable reviews here on Amazon. It is a total waste. Do not buy this product. I am inclined to believe that this technology does not work. Don't believe all the reviews that says it depends on the size of the room, etc./other variables. This simply does not work. Could not even get myself to donate this unit because I don't want anyone to get stuck with it. What a waste of $$. Keep you money buy a regular electric fan at Costco instead."
1,Worst product and worst service,"I live in Arizona and knew that the product was an evaporative cooler. When I received it it worked ok but the pump died after a month. So I have just a fan no cooler. I went to Sunpentown and they said they would send another unit. After 2 weeks I called and told them I had not receive a replacement. ""Oh Sorry!"" they said and then shipped my replacement a week later. This one lasted 10 days before the pump went out. I tried Sunpentown again and they told me that they were busy but would get right back to me. Not a chance that that is going to happen. And it hasn't. All you end up with for your money is a very expensive floor fan that isn't even very good for that. Please save your money. This product is worthless"
1,Didn't work at all,"I gave this the old college try for a few days and it just didn't go anything. I put it in my bedroom and came back a few hours later and nothing. I put ice water and ice cubes in the reservoir and put ice cubes on the vent and it just didn't do anything, so I had to send it back."
1,Evaporative air unit,"The unit is reasonably priced. It offers many settings and comes in an attractively designed case. This unit cools very poorly and requires almost only ice water to perform. It is portable but, requires too much assistance to cool even a small room."
2,Didn't work as advertised,"I've had evaporative coolers before that worked well in our high desert but this one did not perform as advertised. It claimed it would cool the room temperature 10-12 degrees but it didn't cool at all. I wanted to supplement our AC in our den and then wheel it to the bedroom. I loved the features - remote, timer, etc. but was very disappointed in the product. I returned it to Amazon - who made the return very easy."
4,Good Summer Relief,"I bought 1 as a gift to my mother-in-law. Her sister ordered 2 for her children. My brother and sister-in-law ordered 1 each. Everybody liked it. It is because it is quiet, cool and economical(than using A/C). I would highly recommend it for personal use. You probably need a bigger model for family use. I have been an evaporative cooler fan for years but some brands are costly but gives the same effect. But don't have too high expectation. A/C is still cooler but this lower the temperature by some degrees without having to pay high energy bill. Again, I would recommend it for personal use only."
1,Unit failed before 5 minutes,"This unit failed within 5 minutes, after following supplied instructions, by stopping & blowing internal fuse. It could be that the water pump is stuck"
1,Puts out way too much humidity,"Before purchasing this product, check your local weather forecasts, if you live in a high humidity area, this machine will not work, but will only make your room hotter. Even leaving a few windows open does not do the trick.It is an attractive unit, easy to operate, and easy to clean. To drain the water out, there is a plug at the bottom of the unit which easily unscrews. It rolls easily from room to room. The fan is pretty good and distributes the air evenly.Unfortunately because of the high humidity in my area, it is nothing but a overpriced fan. There are days when humidity is quite low, and when it is, I will run it again, and update my review. For now, only one star."
2,Closet size,I used it in a 150 square foot office. I live in Arizone so we all know it's very dry.I suppose if I put it on my desk and pointed it at my face it might have worked.Didn't cool the room at all. Migth work in a really tiny space like a closet but I doubt it. Sent it back after 3 days.
1,Evap cooler,This is a terrible product for the money spent. My temp gauge does not suggest that this Evap cooler even works as it should be..
3,"Nice fan, so so Evaporative Cooler","I picked this unit up due to the fact I have no AC in my bedroom and it was getting up to 85* at night inside. The product works fine but absolutely DO NOT expect this unit to even cool down a bedroom even 1 degrees. I live in a dry climate so that is not an issue. The only effective way to use this unit is to have it blow air directly on to you. And yes, with the evaporator turned on the air coming out of the unit does feel cooler than the rest of the air in the room. So on the hottest of nights with the fan pointed directly at you it definitely helps. Its very important to have a window cracked open even in a dry climate when you use this unit, as it will make the room very humid, defeating the entire cooling purpose. Because this unit does not lower overall room temps at all I pretty much only use it for the hottest nights of the year, but on those nights it is better than nothing and it does have a good fan if nothing else."
4,Sunpentown Portable Evaporative Air Cooler does just that.,"Works great (in dry heat, of course) and I'd recommend to friends.It definitely keeps the temperature down by at least 10, and I find the noise of the fan quite soothing.The only problem is that our dogs and the cat splay themselves around the entire cold-air area (about a 10-15 foot swath), leaving very little cold-air space for the 2-leggeds."
4,Good Buy,"So this isn't as good as an air conditioner -- but is effective at cooling the air about 5-10 degrees depending... You can fill this with 6 liters of water, so logically, the more ice and chilled water, the cooler... We live in Seattle, and it's started to get warm in out apartment - this helps cool down the room -- and I'm writing this review minutes before I place an order for a second unit. This was shipped quickly, with no defects, took only minutes to set up, and we're definitely happy."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I bought this unit based on the relatively positive reviews it was receiving. I have had lots of experience with swamp coolers, and I live in a part of California where there is the kind of low humidity that a unit like this requires. Nonetheless, it was completely ineffectual as cooler; no matter how much ice you add, it will not produce air that's much cooler than what's being pushed through a standard fan. What it does produce is humidity, and lots of it. One of the positive reviews I read about this product claimed just the opposite, but I assure you that such promises are false. You'd be better off looking for other cooling options."
4,Not for the east coast,I should of realized when i read the reviews that this type of cooler is for more dry weather. here is ma. the weather is too damp. it is a great product but does not cool as well in this type of weather. this seller was awesome though. fast prompt delivery.
1,Evaporative Air Cooler,Well basically it a 100 dollar fan and that's about all as for cooling the does not do it very well your better of with a good fan because its no worth the money
1,Stopped Working!,I bought this cooler in September of last year. I used it about 3 times. This year I used it once then I went to turn it back on for the second time and it won't even turn on. That sucks. I have this big unit and nothing to do with it. I want to return it but nowhere to return it to.
1,Piece of crap,"The only good thing I have to say is that it showed up faster than I expected.The ""cool air"" function is broken. The thing keeps beeping at me (which indicates it's out of water) despite having filled the reservoir to max as instructed. I let it run for a bit because I thought it might just need a bit for all the systems to get going. After 48 hours, it's essentially behaving like a really bulky fan. Not what I paid for. I'll be returning this."
1,EVAPORATIVE COOLER,"It arrived well packed, faster than expected. The first day of use it started to leak from the side. Even using refrigerated water and ice it did not cool as much as a big fan."
2,expensive fan,side by side with a fan showed no output difference. loaded up with ice and water and noticed very little difference. Wish I had returned it within the 30 day period. Oh well it is a quiet fan
5,Portable Evaporative Cooler,"This is a great little cooler that will cool down a small to medium size room. It is quiet, small, making it easy to roll around. There is even a compartment for ice cubes, should you desire to use them. We used them - just to check it out - and it cooled the room even more.Overall, it is quiet, efficient, easy to maneuver and affordable."
3,Just Okay,"I bought this for my husband who works outside in the heat. He likes the oscillating feature and the ease of adding water and ice. Unfortunately, it does not blow very hard (the fan it not strong enough)."
3,Ok product,It works well as a fan. However the cooler part is not very efficient. Water needs to filled along with ice for it to work the best.Also the water chamber builds up hard water stains right away. Kind of noisy if you are a light sleeper.We got it as a backup when our AC broke down and could not manage in California.Well they say you get what you pay for.. Good fan for its price is all...
2,Will Return For A Fan.,"I tried very hard to like this machine, but I will probably return it as soon as I have the time. It did not cool the room down 10-12 degrees as indicated. Honestly, I think a fan will work the same. I live in Arizona where the humidity is low and did not like the humidifying function. It made my room stuffy so I finally stopped using it."
2,It's Just OK,"First of all, if you do not live in the dry desert, don't bother. It's not crazy humid here but even with a little humidity this just adds to it. I always used very cold water and a ton of ice and it was barely ""cool air"". I think it would be good in AZ or NV but not worth the money if you live in the northeast like I do. After the first couple of uses I didnt bother with it any more. Waste of money for me."
2,Portable Cooler/Swamp Cooler/Air Cooler,"Well, it is portable. And, it does stir the air about somewhat. But cooler--I don't think so.I have known about and used evaporative coolers dating back to the 1950's and they have generally been effective. Although properly set-up, this unit does not provide anywhere near the same level of cooling I have seen in the past from ""swamp coolers"". The technological advances in this process since the 1950's is completely underwhelming. I would not advise purchasing this product unless you are interested in a fairly expensive fan."
3,Nice but not enough for me,"I ordered this item to attempt to cool my bedroom (small apartment). I live in Denver where we normally have 5% humidity but it is hot this summer. The unit cools the bedroom just a little bit but not enough when it is 100F outside. Although the unit runs through the night, the temp doesn't go down below 85. The one thing I like though is the added humidity. It is so dry here that you almost have to peel your eyelids off your eyeballs in the morning. Having this unit run through the night definitively helped and added some much needed humidity in the place. I don't think this unit is much more noisier than a fan. But given that it is still so hot, I am going to break down and spend the money for an air conditioner.Pros: Easy to set up and use. Easy to move around (even if filled with water). Adds humidity in dry areas.Cons: Doesn't cool my bedroom enough to make it comfortable to sleep."
2,Overpriced fan,"It's been so hot in Colorado - my dogs and I have been suffering with no a/c. Decided to invest in an evaporative cooler and thought this one would be good. WRONG. The air it expels is no cooler than the air from a regular $20 floor fan. Very, very disappointing. Don't make the mistake I made! Go to a real store and try out the evaporative coolers before buying, and don't expect to be cooled off for under $100!!!"
3,"Hm, It's ok I guess.","While it does cool things down a bit, it can sometimes be hard to fill it up with water and ice. I wish the slot to put in water was a little bigger and I also wish the water meter on the front was a bit easier to read. As I stated, it cools things down a little IF you fill it with water and ice. (I suggest going to the store and picking up one of those bags of ice... which will also be a bit of trouble to put in since you can't put in large chunks.) However, if you're looking for something to drastically cool down the room, I'd look for one of the ACs that goes in the window as this doesn't drastically change the temperature of the room. (I'm talking a small room. If you're looking for something more like a fan, but just a bit more on the high end, this will do just fine."
1,Portable Evaporative Air Cooler,I was thoroughly disappointed in this product's performance. It didn't cool as well as the box fan that I had next to it. I do not recommend buying this product.
1,Its a hassle!,"I bought 2 of these air coolers thinking it would at least cool down a small room. You have to fill it with water and ice, and change the water and ice every few days. What a hassle!!! My room never cooled down, it just got more humid. It was a hassle trying to empty it too. Not a good choice. And I really hate that I had to pay shipping and handling for the darn things."
1,Not worth it.,I ended up returning this item as it wasn't worth it. Didn't really cool at all. It's basically a fan that blows your hot air over cool water and comes out a little less hot.
1,1 out of 3 Broke!,"I ordered three of these units for my office. Within the first day, one out of three of them broke. Needless to say, I do NOT recommend this unit to anyone!"
1,Portable Evaporative Air Cooler,Possibly I got a bum product - but I was so disappointed with this purchase - after setting it up.The product - unbeknownst to me - was badly cracked underneath by one of the wheels. It looked so beautiful when brought out of the box. I promptly filled it up with water and ice as mentioned in the directions. After a short time - I wound up seeing a flooded carpet. My neighbor's husband assisted placing it - very carefully - right side up into the tub to drain. Then he went to get the carpet shampooer to vacuum up all of the water. WHAT A MESS! Thankfully I have great neighbors and friends!The crack was huge - possibly it cracked with shipping - but I think it was packaged that way. Hard to tell. I packed it - once dried out - and shipped it back. I decided to buy a ceiling fan for the bedroom instead - and replace the AC in the living room - which - fortunately - cools the remaining rooms sufficiently.
1,SUCKS! DO NOT BUY!!!,I would not recommend this product to anybody for varies reasons listed below:1) leaks water2) does not cool the air at all...a fan does a better job3) cheaply made4) makes it more humid in the roomPro to this product is that it is cheap to buy but definitely does not do its job!!
1,No effect on temperature here.,"I live in the San Diego area, and a friend got one of these. Bluntly, it doesn't seem to do anything to lower the temperature, even when one sits right next to it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,"This product is nothing but a humidifier. I live in a dry area, and used it to cool down a 300sqft room. It didn't work even when I put tons of ice in the machine, on the machine, around the machine. All it did was make it feel musty and wet when anyone walked into the house from outside. I bought two to use in the same room, and it still didn't work. I think anyone would be better off buying a $350 portable AC unit. Dont waste you money on this one."
3,It is a cooling fan not an AC,"This blows moist air on to your skin so it draws the heat away. But it does not cool the room. The only way to make the temperature in a room cooler than the outside air temperature is to use an Air Conditioner. But you don't need an air conditioner to stay cool. Moving air draws away heat, just like the way cooling fans cool computer CPUs. This air cooler just adds moisture to the equation so it cools your skin better than an electric fan that just blows dry air. So make sure that if you buy this that it comes in direct contact with your skin, or else this will not be effective."
3,ok,does not measure up to an air conditioner and it adds humidity to the air which makes it feel hotter but it guess it would be better in a place that does not get so hot here in phoenix the only thing that really helps is the ACthe air that blows out of it does feel cooler then the air going into it though plus it makes a good fan and has a good airflow
4,Great Little Swamp Cooler,"I already have a home swamp cooler, but I had one room that the air never reaches, so I purchased this item. It came already assembled and had very easy instructions. I started using it on a day that reached 100 degrees. This cooler worked great. It changed the temperature in that room from 85 degrees to 72 degrees. I love this cooler! Just make sure that if you do purchase it, that you live in a dry climate. It will not work in a humid climate since it is a swamp cooler!! My reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel like I am refilling the water a little more often then they stated I would have to."
1,Not great,I read most of the reviews before buying. I keep it very close to me in my office and use cold water and ice but it works about as good as a fan. Not worth the money at all in my opinion. Plus no batteries came with it for the remote and when it's on swing it rubs against the back screen making a loud noise.
2,SPT SF-608R Air Cooler,"I bought this air cooler thinking I could save some money over an air conditioner, I started reading the instructions (I know your suppose to wait it I've hosed it up before reading the Instructions), it tells me I need 6 liters of water and 2 liters of ice, now I'm seeing the light, after 6 or 7 trips to fill the cooler, I turned it on, it felt somewhat cool, so I waited, took a hour long walk, the room was just barely cooler. Maybe if I had the time to keep it filled, and run it for a week or more, the room might have been a few degrees cooler. I put it in storage."
1,Portable Air Cooler,"As a fan it works well, however as a cooler, it doesn't cool much, unless you have a ton of Ice. I don't recommend this product. I returned the first one thinking that it was damaged, I sent it back, and they sent me another, and it didn't cool either. So I sent that one back too. Now I'm waiting to be refunded."
5,Original and well done biography of a great lady,"A very good, well researched biography of H.P. Blavatsky. I'd recommend it to anyone who's already read one other biography about the lady. It's not a biography to dive into if you know nothing about theosophy or the Theosophical Society, but one to read if you want to go into her life in depth more.It's a sympathetic biography that does not ignore the controversy around Blavatsky."

3,Decent shoe for the price,"This shoe was a decent value and lasted about 400 miles of pavement running, but I developed some knee inflammation because they don't provide much ankle support. On casual Fridays in the office I wore them to do a lot of walking around our big facility, with no knee pain. After this pair I upgraded to the Mizuno Wave Alchemy - which cost 3 times as much - and have no problems whatsoever after running hard for about 500 miles."
3,The New Goldstein,"If you have no exposure to Classical Mechanics or if you starting new then DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. This book is of advance nature. Books like Arya, Hauser or Corben are simpler.The book starts with the basics, wraps up Newtonian Mechanics in the first chapter. The next five chapters deal in detail with Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations and their applications. They discuss some difficult topics like ""Tangent Bundle"" ""Tangent Spaces"" and ""lie groups"". ""Noether's theorem"" is also included which I have not seen in many Classical Mechanics books.There are many worked out examples which help the reader understand the subject.The explanations are quite lucid.There are plently of excercises to do but no answers to problems!"
4,Everthing as expected,"A nice book, with modern terminology and up to date. Explains and uses linear forms and is fairly explicit. Covers most subjects, useful for beginners and to look things up."
1,stay away from this boring waste of time and money,"If you're expecting comedy from this DVD, run away, and quickly. The focus is on the discussions that go on back stage as various comedians, including Seinfeld, work on their acts, and try to build or re-establish their careers. The dialog is almost impossible to hear at times, because they have music playing over it. The result is almost unlistenable. I bought it because I thought it was funny. Out of the whole thing, you'll get about 5 minutes of laughs. Spend your money elsewhere. It's beyond me why Seinfeld, who is now MADE of money, thought it worthwhile to produce this snore fest."
2,Comedian not funny.,"I like Jerry Seinfeld. Alot. The show was funny, all his stand up was funny, but this movie wasn't. And its not just about Seinfeld. It's also about some egotistical manian named Orny Adans who also isn't funny. Don't make the mistake that I did and see this movie."
1,So not worth it.,"Jerry Seinfeld Comedian, isn't funny. And if it isn't funny, really why bother. Loves his CD before this, so I thought this would be great, and it is not. Kept waiting for something better and it just did not happen. It is not stand-up and it following him behind the seasons, and even that isn't really appealing. Skip it, and get one of his stand-up routines."
2,Embarrassed for Seinfeld,"Seinfeld's gaffe on this DVD is one we've all made, and not surprising considering his adulation of Bill Cosby.The scene is backstage with Bill Cosby and Cosby expounds on how amazing it is to be him (note HIM) at this late stage of his career. He eventually says something like ""there you are among the greats like Willie Mays, Hank Aaron ..."" etc. and Jerry thinks the ""you"" in the sentence means Jerry! It makes him so happy!It made me squirm when I watched the regular version and I wondered why they left that in, but then I watched Jerry's commentary version and he again (as in the film) said how appreciative he was of Cosby's high praise...UGH!!!!!I can only think that having lots of money stupefies the people around you into having no thoughts other than your own. Or could it be meanness on the part of those who could have set him straight?"
2,NOT what I expected,"If you want stand up.... THIS IS NOT THE DVD FOR YOU. See Jerry's other DVD ""One Last Time""... hilarious! If you want to learn HOW to become a comedian... this DVD is for you. What made me upset what that as I was watching they were interviewing this other comedian Orny Adams... okay... I thought this was about Jerry Seinfeld. Whatever. Don't expect this DVD to ENTERTAIN. I couldn't even finish watching, quite boring, unless of course you are trying to become a stand up comedian. Thank goodness I only rented it. I would have been quite upset if I had actually spent MONEY on this!!"
1,Comedian??,"I recently watched this DVD and was severely disappointed. As a Seinfeld fan I was looking for laughs and entertainment. I found no observational humor and there wasn't anything to laugh about. Some could argue that the reason for it's ""amateur"" feel is to be artistic and show a larger meaning...but it doesn't do anything for the movie. It became quite annoying after awhile, kind of how you feel after watching a friend's home video: unsteady, poor quality, not interesting whatsoever and all you want to do is leave.Portions of stand up were shown and all that was heard was the punchline - leaving nothing for viewers. Pieces of conversations were also shown, and sometimes it was hard to understand because they were talking in a noisy setting.I don't recommend this at all. It was absolutely painful to watch. If your looking for a stand up routine, or a funny behind the scenes look at comedy - DON'T watch this DVD."
2,"Disappointing, at the most.","Since I was expecting an actual routine, not a documentary, it was boring. A few parts were funny but all in all it was a waste of time. Don't get me wrong, I love Seinfeld the show and I'm sure that his stand up is awesome too. Unless you are a hardcore Seinfeld fan or considering becoming a professional comedian, I just don't see how this could be entertaining."
2,Seinfeld - behind the scenes,"This portrays to be a ""behind the scenes"" view of several comedians' lives showing the ups and downs of the occupation. I found it to be boring and that it just drags on. It had some funny lines but was not a comedy; it gave us some information of the occupational lives of comedians but just scattered, disjointed and incomplete. I just do not believe there is any reason for this DVD."
2,Totally Misleading,"This was a total waste of money....I Love Seinfeld, but this ""documentary"" has little to do with Jerry Seinfeld and a lot to do with a bunch of other comedians. WAY MISLEADING!!!!"
5,A Must See for anyone remotely even THINKING about going into stand-up comedy...,"Jerry Seinfeld allows the viewer to see his hits, his flaws, his wins, and his fails. He wears his heart on his sleeve. The other comedian (Orny Adams) also followed on a journey of upward movement in the industry comes across as extremely self centered. Where Jerry's character (not one he plays, but HIS human character) says ""I want to make people laugh , have a good time, that's what I'm here for"", Orny is all about ""How big is the crowd, are they good, why don't they get me? I've worked hard, blah blah blah..."" . Don't get me wrong, Orny is a funny guy, he just needs to shift his focus off HIM and onto his customers, the people he is there to make laugh, after all they did pay to see him. And yes, I've done stand-up before."
3,Strange insight into comedy,"While watching this film, I was struck by how self-defeating and self-absorbed these comedians really are. Immediately after each performance, they dice themselves to pieces backstage and then go home to watch the tape to critique themselves more. I just have 2 questions: why feature Orny Adams? and why should we care about him?!?!?!"
3,bad features,"they doesn't say that the DVD din't have spanish subs, in general a great dvd, but shame on the subs...."
1,Poor,"This was the most pointless misleading movie I have ever seen.I bought this thinking there would be stand-up comedy. But soon found out it was a slow, overly drawn out documentary, about comedians and the review on the cover saying it was ""very funny"" truly led me to believe it was. Sad."
4,Very funny back end of comedy!,This movie was really great! The two stories that you see in the movie are different but awesome! You really get to see the hard work that it takes to be a stand up comedian. This is a must have for the collection.
4,What does being obnoxious have to do with being funny?,"This documentary does give an insight into the minds of a group who stand or fall almost wholly based on what they alone create. Those who buy it expecting a stand-up routine should learn to read, however my point is...Many other reviews slaughter the 'other' comedian, Orny Adams, re how narcissistic, arrogant etc he is and how this would clearly hamper his career. I mean, look at 'good egg' Jerry, he succeeded. Personally, I found Adams unfunny, but think about it... narcissistic, deeply angry, contemptuous of both his audience and peers, insecure? Emm, Larry David anyone? If it wasn't for that kind of flawed/human character, Seinfeld would never have become the success that he became."
4,Jerry is Great and Adams is trying but still whiny,"This is a great movie that shows the struggle that comedians go through. Jerry makes an impressive rise with new material in a short time. Adams comes off as an up in coming comedian who is paranoid that he will never make it, which he will probably never amount to much more than a side note in a Seinfeld movie. Adams ripping on Steven Wright and more subtly on Jerry shows that he thinks he is better than everyone.It is a great movie which shows the largely unseen side of comedians."
4,"It's gold, Jerry! Gold!","A fascinating look at stand-up comedy by one of the most brilliant and successful comedians ever, Jerry Seinfeld. This movie chronicles his return to the stage after ""retiring"" all his old bits in his HBO special, ""I'm Telling You For the Last Time."" There's no shortage of funny moments, but it's the insight into the world of stand-up comedy that makes this such an interesting movie. I didn't care too much about the part about Orny Adams, a young, up-and-coming comic, though. I guess it was necessary to contrast his ""journey"" with Jerry's, but I just found it distracting and not all that interesting."
2,Whose Orny anyway?,"A comedian? He doesn't seem funny to me and definately isn't the next big thing. It seems Jerry is still hiding behind other people, or at best just trying to blend in. This would have been infinately better minus the Orny stuff. A. I've never heard of him. B. Anything they've showed of him wasn't even remotely funny. And on top of that it's just way too much of him. The Jerry stuff is pretty good, not very informative (like the packaging makes out). Hopefully the commentaries will be good but as it stands now, I shouldn't have bought this because I doubt I will rewatch it... I will keep taping Seinfeld each night and try and forget about this dvd."
2,How to make 81 minutes seem like a lifetime.,"This film may only last 81 minutes but it will challenge your whole idea of perception. It seems at least twice as long, as dreary and repetitive scenes follow endlessly. Poorly directed with no linear development and poorly focussed dingy interiors.More like reality TV from the E channel than a movie.Sorry, I know the major players should command more respect..."
3,"Good, simple case.","I bought this case for my iPod video while searching for a simple yet good looking leather flip style case. There weren't many choices at the time, and I decided to go with this case as it was one of the few with a built in clip, as I didn't want the extra bulk of the removable clips. It was a bit stiff and smelled like chemicals rather than leather when I got it, but I used some shoe conditioner on it and it turned out great. It's held up well and I am going on 2 years of ownership so that is a plus as well."
5,FITS IPOD CLASSIC!,I was scared to order this because i didnt know if it would fit my ipod classic 6th gen. and it does! it fits perfect
3,Not what I expected,This product is cheaply made. I expected something a little larger and more durable. Looks cheap..not bad enough for me to send back but not thrilled.
3,One good remix...,"Of the three ""Far Above the Clouds"" remixes on this import single, the Timewriter's Radio Mix is what makes this single a worthy purchase. I heard the remix in a department store and this was the only CD on which I could find this particular mix. It's both ambient and pleasantly creepy. The 10-minute Jam & Spoon Mix is alright, but over-long and repetitive...it makes for good background noise, though. The original version only made me like the Timewriter's mix even more. If you like ""Sadeness"" by Enigma, music from the Exorcist, or that twisted Skittles commercial with the gargoyles, you'll love this remix."
2,Howzatt,"Although I have enjoyed some of Karen,s books,this was not one of them.The main character is just plain annoying ,and you,d be hard pressed to feel any empathy for her.The story was not involving enough"
3,"No, It Did Not Just End Like That!","I really hated the abruptness of the ending. It was like Karin Alvtegen just stopped writing. I found that frustrating as I become so invested in the fate of the two main characters. Otherwise, a well written, at time poetic, account of these two women finding a way to survive and shine (for the most part) despite their circumstances."
2,Misled by the Hype,"I read all the hype about this book so I got it. I ploughed thru it wondering when it would reveal it's greatness. Actually the end finally makes it all OK, but you may not last long enough to get that far, but do try as it actually is a great ending."
5,At long last--vintage Julie Andrews and Henry Mancini,"I've been waiting for this one for quite some time. There is wonderful music from the movie...with several numbers that are not in the version that I've watched on American Movie Classics (a children's song and a beer drinking song). Unfortunately, the liner notes only give the storyline--not any other details. Julie Andrews' voice is at its peak. And the burlesque songs are fun to dance to in the privacy of your own home."
5,2 thumbs up!,"This book has taught me how to be a method actor. Until I read this book I was strugglling with my acting, I could never really find the charactor. But with this book I was able to analize a charactor successfully. And as a result I have improved my acting skills and gotten larger and better parts in plays. I highly recomend this book if you're struggling with your acting or if you are just staarting to explore the world of acting. It's a great place to start."
4,"Great book for the money,...","""On Method Acting"" was the first book out of dozens I bought that actually still held in the four cornerstones of this approach as developed by Stanislovski and Strasberg. Those being observation, focus, sense memory, affective memory and intense concentration holding the corners together. The true Method simply is not the method without these four cornerstones which sometimes takes years to master. For the money, this small book gives the novice a good sound understanding of this unorthodox approach. How many people gain 55 pounds for one scene. How many file their own teeth down rather than wear false ones and how many can be in character 24/7 from the conception of the films beginnings to it's final days in post. Method actors are the REAL actors! This book follows around the roots of the ""Methods"" first attempt moving from stage to screen and gives a little insight into the insanity that it truly takes to be a ""Method.""A very good book for a very nice price."
4,relationship recue workbook,My husband and I have lived in different worlds for 6+yrs he Army and station in different states and been depoyed now in his 4th x ..so I bought 2 books for him and myself so we can work on a lot of things at the same time ...to hope fully bring us back together.
4,The Relationship Rescue Workbook,This is a great asset to people that want an in depth look at their relationship.
5,Excellent thought provoking book!,"As always, Dr. Phil has insight that makes perfect sense but the rest of us just don't get quite so easily! He tells you like it is and expects you to do nothing more than be honest with yourself. He has excellent exercises to do that require some soul searching at times, and his advice is thought provoking and effective! I highly recommend this book if you are having relationship issues, and neither of you wants to end it, but neither of you knows how to fix it either. It really helps if you both do it together but one person could get a lot of advice and direction to go too. Also recommend you get the workbook that goes with this book...makes it much easier than a bunch of notebooks everywhere with the exercises he has you do throughout.I don't think you will regret this purchase. Dr. Phil ROCKS!"
2,"Good Title, Little Substance","I picked up Dr. Phil's book with little experience of him but trusting his notoriety must be based on some wisdom he is offering. I didn't find wisdom in this book. IMO, Dr. Phil complains that arguments are inevitable, men and women are hopelessly different, etc. The idea of people taking 100% full, personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences is not mentioned in his book. I've gotten better advice from Dr. David Wolf's 'Relationships that Work: The Power of Conscious Living' book which helped me find new ways to create a great marriage without needing my spouse to change or read any book."
5,Whoa this is intense,"I was not quite ready for the work this requires. However, it is well worth it for the positive results."
2,Dr. Phil,"Difficult to follow and takes a lot of work and time, probably a good read if you have the time"
3,Useful Exercises,"The workbook for Relationship Rescue has some very useful exercises. It definitely supplemented my understanding of my relationship and helped fill in for me some of the parts of the main book that I didn't understand.While I like his ""no-nonsense"" approach - I also find that there are other books with a more balanced as well as spiritual approach that were also very helpful as well as as profound for me in my relationship. The two books that I am thinking of are not usually what people think of as ""Relationship"" Books but I highly recommend them. 1) The Mastery of Love, by Ruiz; and 2) Working On Yourself Doesn't Work, by A. and S. Kane. Both these books have deep insights about how to be more truthful, how to have more compassion, and how to not get caught in being ""right"", and to learn how to stop fighting your partner/lover/mate...and how to have harmony and happiness."
1,"Ms. Hoag, learn to EDIT!","Oy. I thought I would never get through it. How many times do I have to read the same information about the characters for me to ""get it?"" Only once, but that doesn't stop Ms. Hoag from beating that dead horse. I will avoid this author in the future."
2,"most ""intense suspense""???","cant judge a book by the cover!! or the prologue,because the prologue is the coolest part in this whole book, besides a few other scenes. a few scenes out of 530 pages is not worth reading. this books cover says its ""without a doubt the most intense suspense"". nope. It is interesting finding out who the killer is and his life story. its just falsely advertised"
2,Not Really Worth The Effort,"I must admit that this book was really not worth the effort it took to read it. I am a fan of the romance genre, but I still was let down by this book. I wanted suspense/with a little bit of romance and I was very upset that it took more then half of the book to get around to the suspense part (it had such promise with the prologue) and that the effort that was put into the suspense was not very good. I really was not compelled to continue reading. There was no ""hook"" and I did not feel that I would miss out if I never picked the book up again. I feel that this was really not a worthy effort by this talented authour. I am glad that I bought it used instead of new. If you want to read this borrow it from the library or a friend. Don't waste your money."
3,Cry Wolf,This book isn't sure if it wants to be a love story or a crime thriller. There is too much focus on the main characters blossoming relationship and not enough detail on the murders and murderer.
1,Waste of some my nights,"I thought she should have spent more time in South Louisiana reserching for this book. First of all resturants around here do not sell Rhubarb pie. At the very least she could have used real ""Cajun"" last names along with the names of towns and Parishs. There is nothing ""Cajun"" about this book. As far as the story goes I am still wondering why ""Jimmy Lee"" was even included in the story, or the fight between Savanah and Annie. The way that Hoag would describe items, places or individuals went way beyond then what was necessary. Jack felt sorry for himself, not deserving of anything the entire book, what a bore that was. Laurel, what a pity she was wanting to cry at every turn. This the second Hoag book I have read and it will be the last."
4,Guilty pleasure; mix sexy romance with a dash of mystery.,"If your taste in mystery runs toward Ellis Peters, Ngaio Marsh or Dorothy Sayers, loosen up for some beach reading. The writing is not up to those gold standards, but is surprisingly good: the plot is interesting; the relationships among the characters believable and compelling; the romance is scorching. Sexy good reading with a happy ending. Check it out."
3,To much backround not enough suspense,"This book was not exactly a typical mystery story Half the book, the first four hundred pages centered on Laurel, the lawyer who had come back to her home town to be left alone.The book went on and on about her own physical state and how she could never obtained the rest she had desired, only to fall in love with a man she counldn't get through to. The book also went on about her twisted childhood and her rich emotionless mother. The last hundred pages is where the action began, only to diminish in the last ten pages, to go back to Laurel and Jack. ""Will they finaly get through to one another?"" It's for you to find out. I've read other books by her and this book was not what I had expected it to be. The back cover of the book was deceiving. If you like a little romance mixed in with a little mystery you should read it."
2,A Very Annoying Heroine,"This was my first book by this author and I was very disappointed. While she does get a A++ for her research of the locale and Cajun dialect, I found the heroine , Laurel Chandler to be very annoying. If she was going to rehash her past experience as a DA and the case that lead to her downfall one more time I was ready to put the book in the trash. I wanted to scream, Get Over It and Move on! The rest of the characters , including Jack (who I failed to find appealing or sexy) were fair to midland. I found myself intrigued with what the handsome DA Steven was wearing. His wardrobe sounded straight from GQ. So much for the story!"
2,slower than molasses,"This book took absolutely forever to get going. Read the first page about a murder, almost 30 chapters of filler, then towards the end she finally gets around to writing about a resolution to the murder.The 30 chapters of filler revolve around the two main characters week long session of love making and weak emotional breakdowns. My wife loved it.Overall impression of the book: Lame."
2,Waste of time,This book dragged on and on. The identity of the killer was predictable. The final fight scene was short and lacked imagination. The book has a few steamy love scenes but otherwise is worthless. I would spend my time and money reading another book.
5,A steamy suspense thriller,Hoag does it again with this exciting romantic thriller. The characters portrayed in the book are realistic and believable with real live problems that are easy to relate to. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a little romance along with an edge of your seat plot that you won't want to put down.
3,Nice but needs more help,"Cry Wolf was a good story but it needed more details such as why the killer was so evil and wanted to kill the women in the most seriously disgusting ways.This was more of a romance than a suspense.I like romance, but this book should have more suspense.The hero was a guy who was always busy feeling sorry for himself and thinking he was not good enough for the heroine.The heroine was cool but a little too prim. All in all, it was okay."
3,Cry Wolf,"I thought this one was a pretty good book, though it didn't talk a whole lot about the murders. It had more romance than mystery in it which made the cover a little misleading."
4,Mystery and Suspense,"Cry Wolf is a great suspense novel, and one of my favorite Hoag books. The characters are colorful, the killer was somewhat of a surprise and the last pages of the book are impossible to put down. The romantic storyline was a little too sappy otherwise this book is a terrific read."
1,Painful AND laughable,"Can't I give zero stars? I had read ""Night Sins"" and thought it tolerable at best. I made the mistake of giving Hoag another chance with this dismal effort. As someone who's lived near the setting of much of this book, I cringed at the pitiful stereotyping. Laughable characters and an adolescent plot (I don't mean to insult adolescents) actually prompted me to mark the book with a post-it note, warning would-be readers. (in my home, not a library) I realize Hoag has her followers, and I suppose writing like this has its place--perhaps alongside dime romance novels--but I'll pass on future Hoag works, thank you."
4,"""CRY WOLF""","Way down in the deep part of the swamp, there is some thing there. Some Hounddog is baying in the silver moon light. This is suspenseful story with a touch of question what is going to happen next on the next page. Did it ever keep me reading!"
2,Yawn - quite disappointing,"I've read Tami Hoag books before and enjoyed them. However, this was not at all what I expected. It was almost like two books sewn together. The first 50% (thank you Kindle) was all romance and I kept wanting to slap the guy, he was so crude and obnoxious. At the 50% mark we finally get another murder, but still it goes back to the romance and the personal problems of the character. The murder comes second or even third. I finally gave up and skimmed to the 81% mark where it looked like we were finally being told who the killer was.I gave it two stars vs. just one because unlike Twilight and Fifty Shades I was (kind of) able to finish it. Alas, zero stars is not an option for unbearable books and books like this get 2 stars vs. 1."
2,Cry Wolf,"Very disappointed with this effort by Tami Hoag. Not up to her usual standards. Found myself skipping over some of the parts (which I never do). Slow moving, far too much sex discriptions (I'm not a prude) and takes too long to get to the murders part of the story."
3,not my favourite,"it was a slow start to this book, i keep expecting hoag to grab my attention from the first sentence like her other books but it did not happened here...the mystery part came late in this book and when it came, i was excited..here was laurel trying to get a fresh start but was drawn into the murder case involving women who ""deserved to die because they slept around"" which aso involved her sister..the plot was interesting, the killer was playing a game with her, letting know who he was and when laurel knew who it was, she could not do anything not only due to lack of evidence but also lack of credibility as she was previously labelled as ""the lawyer who cried wolf""i was really excited to know how laurel's going to pull it off but it was dissapointing on how it all ends...i expected more from hoag...it could've been better"
4,Terrific- but same storyline,"I just finished this book yesterday and it was very good. I couldn't put it down in the end (but i had a good idea of who the killer was when they first brought him into the picture,but I kept wondering if it was him or not. I love mysteries, and this definetly had a twist on it with who the killer was. I recommend AShes to Ashes to anyone who wants to read Tami Hoag, but read that one later on, because that one really surprised me with the killer!!!"
2,More romance...,"Normally love TH books... do not like same ole' romance in any shape or form. Too much sex and not enough about the murders... This book should have been called ""sex on the bayou"". Just finished the book so I could confirm my suspicions on the murderer...."
3,a book with 2 personalities,"This book, CRY WOLF, was a pretty good book, other then the fact that it was mostly a romance novel. During the beginning of this book, it concentrates on the growing relationship between Laurel and Jack... It wasn't until about halfway through where the book actually got serious about the Bayou Strangler. Before the death of a bartender in the area, the strangler is really just an afterthought if that. If Tami Hoag had interwoven more about the Bayou Strangler in the beginning, which was supossed to be the main theme of the book, then I could have rated it a full 5 stars... Stick with the theme!"
3,Not her best-,At first I felt sorry for Laurel and Jack:they both had suffered terrible childhoods. They carried wounds into their adult life damaging their professional and personal lives. But enough is enough! The first half kept reminding me of their scars and not enough about the killer's state of mind . It picked up in the second half when Laurel began to acknowledge her sister's self destructive behaviour might possibly lead her and her sister into a terrible fate.Romance between Laurel and Jack was nice but overall Night SIns was much better.
5,ABSOLOUTELY LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My first Hoag book, and still my favorite. I have since read Night Sins, Guilty As Sin, Dark Paradise and Ashes To Ashes, but Cry Wolf is still tops, as far as I'm concerned. Loved the portrayal of the bayou, the suspense, and the feeling of knowing what was going on without being able to really get that last piece to fit in, 'til the very end."
2,Hardly worth the trouble,"I am a Michael Connelly-Robert Crais-Philip Margolin fan, and I don't think Tami Hoag is in their league. However, I have read a few of her novels and, for the most part enjoyed them. Cry Wolf, however, reads like a harliquin romance for the first 300 pages. I found that I really didn't care about either of the two main characters.The book did pick up a bit after page 300, but one shouldn't have to wait that long for the plot to move."
1,"""I should have walked away"" quote on page 528","I had selected this book to read based on recommendations of several friends. It was one of the most difficult books I have read. (Difficult in that I kept saying to myself, Why are you reading this?) To much time was spent in setting up the plot and the ending was so abrupt. Ms. Hoag never spent time setting up the monster villian but spent two much time on the whining of ""Jack and Laurel"". I got tired of the phrase ""I should have left"" Actually it should have been me, that left this book. This will be my last reading of this authors work."
2,Too Much Romance,This book does not live up to Tami Hoag's standards. I thought it was a new book but it is written like a romance and hyped as a mystery. It is full of goopy hate-love senarios that are soooooo boring. I bought the audio book which was quite expensive and I am very sorry.
1,A Romance Novel,"I have read two other books by Tami Hoag. Both were very good murder/mystery novels. After reading one half of Cry Wolf, this is NOT anything but a romance story. Not what I wanted at all."
3,There is a Plot...,"As a Tami Hoag fan, I found this book to have a slow start. The storyline tempts the reader and lays ideas that ""something"" has happened to both of the main characters, Jack and Laurel; however, it is slow at revealing what the ""something"" is. Unlike Hoag's other books which starts off with a murder mystery, the first half of the book delves into a the love story part of the plot. Because I enjoy Hoag for the Who-Dunnit stories, I felt that the first half dragged on. Not a bad read, but does not measure up to my favorite, A Thin Dark Line. Both Cry Wolf and A Thin Dark Line take place in South Louisiana, a place that is near and dear to my heart."
1,"Cry Wolf, Cry Reader","When you read this earlier work of Tami Hoag, you can see just how much she has improved. In Cry Wolf, she thinks she is Barbara Cartland with murders. It is hard to imagine that this is the author who wrote such outstanding novels as Ashes to Ashes.Here's how the book goes: Oh, dark passion! Oh, deep secrets! Oh sex, love, violence! Electra! Swamp, alligators! Whimper, moan, and whine. Laissez le bon temps rouler, `tite chatte! Oh, violence! Sex! Dark secrets! Deep passion! Oh, stereotypes! Oh, clichés! Whine, whine, whine. Sultry, hot, humid, violent swamp, bon Dieu! Sex! Deep, dark passion! Dark, deep secrets!Okay, that'll take you up to about page 250. From there on, read about four lines every page and you can keep up with the story.I don't know if the wolf cried, but the reader may cry from boredom."
5,Big bad wolf in the swamps of Louisiana,"Laurel Chandler is a disturbed prosecutor coming home from Georgia for some R&R after her own ""cry wolf"" incident. She needs some emotional healing, but gets caught up in a serial killer drama instead. The killer is playing games with her, singling her out by slipping her trophies from the dead girls found in the swamp.This book is rich with descriptions of the Louisiana scenary, the Cajun people, and many interesting suspects. Ms Hoag goes to great lengths to build the story with gripping background material on a number of shady characters. I thoroughly enjoyed trying out my own theories as to which one could have the motive and opportunity to commit the murders. Near the end, the killer reveals him/herself to our heroine in a cutesy fashion, further adding to the drama. Read it. You'll love it."
2,More of a romance novel than mystery/suspense,"Expecting a mystery/suspense novel, I was disappointed because Cry Wolf had little mystery and little suspense. Although several murders had taken place, there was little action toward investigating the murders or collecting evidence. For the most part, it was a soap opera, involving Laurel, her sister Savannah, her mother, her father and her step-father. Cry Wolf was pretty much what I was *not* looking for or expecting. I'll have to be more careful in selecting books in the future. END"
5,Brilliant!,"I thought this one was of Tami Hoag's best books yet! This is the most intense book with one predictable death that you're almost thankful for, and learning about Laurel and Jack's past makes your heart break. One of the best books I've ever read."
3,Sultry Southern setting ... a tad too much romance,"I've just re-read ""Cry Wolf"" (while waiting for Tami's latest book). A good plot, good read. I love Tami's writing, especially her novels set in Louisiana. She can bring the whole area alive to her readers in other cities and countries. More than any other author I've read. I love the Cajun French, the atmosphere (one can almost hear, smell, taste and feel all of it). I've read all her novels (except the ""Loveswept"" stuff). Don't get me wrong! ... I'm a real romantic like most red-blooded, heterosexual females ... as well as a fan of the mystery/crime/thriller genre and most of ""Cry Wolf"" is good ... but nothing can touch ""A Thin Dark Line"". In my opinion, her best ever novel set in Louisiana. Just the right amount of sexual tension/actual sex, between the protagonists who NEVER lose sight of their mutual main objective. If you're looking for what I've described ... read it before ""CW""!!"
1,Angst-filled novel with little suspense or romance,"I've read page-turning suspense novels and tension-filled romance novels. This was neither. After more than 200 pages, the two main characters still had not gotten together. But they had spent numerous nights/days/afternoons hammering themselves with retribution over their past failures that poured into pages upon pages of guilty, angst filled thoughts. Oh, and in between, a couple of women are found dead.Reading about a woman who is near anorexic, wears baggy clothes, over-sized glasses and chews her nails at every turn of the page was not my idea of a fun read. She was only slightly better by the last page. I don't think the author had a clear idea of what this book should be--a romance novel or a suspense novel. It turns out to be not much of either. In the end, I didn't care about either one of the main characters. They need counseling...and I hope they get it."
2,Disappointed - not the mystery thriller I expected,I gave up half way through - way too much I love you - No I hate you sappy romance and pathetic sex sequences. By mid-book there was no murder mystery thatI had expected.Not worth the time it takes to get to the point.Tami Hoag should just stick with the murder mystery stuff and forget the romance - or at list keep it to a minimum.
3,Good but could be better,"I'd read a few of her other books and I feel this book pretty much ignored the suspense part. A lot, lot of focus on romance which is good if balanced with enough treatment on the suspense as well. However, I still enjoyed the book."
1,Too much sex,"A major theme of this book is sex in its many different forms. Another is sexual attraction and dissipation among different kinds of people. If you like reading this kind of stuff, have at it. I couldn't make it through the book, even though I like mysteries, and there is supposed to be a mystery buried in the book, somewhere."
1,Not the versions you are expecting,Ugh. These are absolutely horrible electronic versions of the songs you are expecting. Sounds like somebody pounded them out on the Casio in his garage.
5,Amt 66 Mustang,This model (not a toy) I bought to have a 65/66 mustang on my shelf with my other model cars I've built. It has many options and is very detailed.
4,Car Model easy to build,"I built this model to look like my actual 1966 Mustang, and have won a modeling contest at our car club two consectative years."
3,Not an INTRODUCTION to Indian History,Dr Spear seems to be writing for one already educated in the who did what in British india. He continually presents events that he assumes are within the knowlege of the reader and then attempts to show how these events affected the shape of modern India.
1,good dvd,"this dvd was okay but it was more about the diva shoot then the divas. it usually more bout the divas and how they go to the WWE but all they did was goof off.EXTRA MATCHESTrick or treat match: Torrie Wilson vs Dawn MariePilgrin fashion show: Torrie Wilson & Dawn MarieValentines Day Bra & Panties: Torrie wilson vs Dawn MarieSantas lil helper Match: Stacy,Jacqueline,Trish vs Molly,Ivory,VictoriaLingerie pillow fight: Terri vs Stacy KeiblerBra/Panties Paddle on a pole: Trish Stratus vs Stacy KeiblerBikini Match: Torrie Wilson vs NidiaTriple threat for Womens Title: Molly vs Jacqueline vs TrishInterpromotional bikini challenge: Trish Stratus vs TorrieChicago street fight for womens title: Trish vs Victoria"
1,Don't Be A Sucka!!!!,"To quote Booker T, ""Don't be a sucka!!!"" Everything about this video is garbage, no nudity, no kinky sex scenes, nada.. Granted there are some dime piece divas( Stacy Keibler, Torie Wilson, Dawn Marie ), but they're accompanied by hulking she beasts. I feel cheated, I bet Mr. McMan is laughing all the way to the bank. Keep your money, go to the club, or get some beers, you'll be happier in the morning..."
4,wordless...,"Incredible songs, great editing. Despite the comments of the photos are too small and do not get to read. Probably because they were from the first edition (1995) that the book is bigger. However i recommend it and score 8 points."
2,Should be one CD,"95% of this box set will make a true rock n' roller cringe. RCA should have combined the handful of good '70s singles with some live staples on one CD instead. That's all anyone would ever need of EP in the '70s. I sold this set to a record shop a week after I bought it. I love Elvis to death. But this is garbage, worse than the trash from the movies. At this point in his career, Elvis was literally dying from his pill addiction. He's high on stage and the Colonel gives him more crap to record in the studio. Save yourself from being embarrassed for your idol. All you need is the Complete '50s Masters Set, TigerMan, Memories:The Comeback Special, Suspicious Minds:The 1969 Memphis Sessions and download the good stuff from the early '60s and '70s. Remember Elvis for his greatness, this collection is just plain depressing."
5,Stunning,"This box set is one incredible surprise after another. Elvis, during the 70s, had one of the most incredible bands ever assembled, and the musicianship on this collection is spectacular. The sound is simply explosive, especially on little-known gems like Heart of Rome and We Can Make the Morning. The collection is divided into 3 sections: 1) all of his singles, 2) a mesmerizing live show compilation, and 3) album highlights. It also has some cool outtakes, such as a crazy impromptu jam on Lady Madonna. You cannot do better than this box set. Elvis was truly the greatest rock star ever, and this is a testament to his passion and talent."
3,Could have been better,"I would have preferred that this box was handled like the 60s box, featuring EVERY non-movie, non-gospel, non-live master in chronological order. And they would still have had room for outtakes and rarities. The 5th live disc crowds out many studio masters, (albeit generally the lesser ones) and just how many 70s concerts do we need anyway, they have become overly redundant. But, for what it is, really an anthology highlights collection, it is just fine.I have been an Elvis fan since in the womb, and I own just about every commercially available recording anyway. I buy these compilations for the unreleased tracks and also I really like the way the 50s and 60s box puts everything in chronological order based on recording sessions. This 70s box broke from that format and disappointed me. Maybe I will have to buy ""THE COMPLETE ELVIS PRESLEY MASTERS"" to finally fulfill my desire for a perfect archive."
4,From Vegas to Graceland,"94 great songs plus a complete CD of songs taken from different shows live in the 70's. Even if these last songs are great, the mood of a complete Elvis'show is missing.The remastering is great and the sound is better than ever.The booklet gives interesting informations on recording sessions and musicians.Sadly, this is the last opus of a Trilogy. You can prefer the two first. It'not a problem. There is always an Elvis for everyone."
5,Nina Trnka dictionary is very handy for travellers,"Some of the people who wrote a review for this dictionary and gave it one star have no idea what they're talking about. This dictionary was created for travellers to use while they were trying to bus or backpack their way through the Czech Republic and wasn't intended for use in an intensive Czech language study. You people make this out to be the worst dictionary ever written. You are mistaken. I personally used this dictionary on my recent trip to Moravia and found it very helpful for travellers, so you ""so called"" Czech dictionary experts should consider what this dictionary was intended for before you go slamming it and giving it only one star."
1,NOT a good resource!,"I purchased this dictionary years ago just prior to relocating to Prague. It was one of the few such dictionaries available at the time for English-speaking Czech language students. I found the book to be woefully inadequate in the number of words, examples of usage, and grammar points given for each entry. I have a rather large collection of dictionaries now in both the Czech and Russian languages and Trnka's book was one of the worst I'd ever seen. I ultimately disposed of the book. In fact, most Hippocrene language books I've seen in bookstores are of very poor quality. As a linguist, I would never recommend them. One would be much better off purchasing Czech published dictionaries as I eventually was able to do."
2,Ehh...,"Annoying font, confusing layout, highly abridged. This book is supposed to be a reference tool, but it seems like the publishers decided to try to make it look ""hip"" by giving it a stylized old-fasioned typewriter font and putting the entries in all lower-case. You will find about as much content in a phrasebook (though in a different layout.) For in-depth translations, definately go with one of the larger (pricier) hardcovers."
1,"Lacks important words, sometimes poorly translated","This is such a bad dictionary I am surprised it is still being bought. Many essential words are lacking, and on more than one occassion have I faced an incorrect translation in this book. I have to agree with the other reviewer - buy a dictionary when you get to the Czech Republic. There are about seven or eight other concise English-Czech Czech-English dictionaries to choose from, and any of them are better than Hippocrene's."
1,Shoddy craftsmanship and then some,"The spine in this ""dictionary"" broke the first time I opened it. The typeface sucks, as does the ink quality. The entries are unrevealing. The information presented is extremely basic and not particularly useful. I wouldn't even keep it in my back pocket as a handy reference because the general lack of any organizational format beyond the listing of words in alphabetical order and the fact that it's falling apart after two openings do not render it especially ""handy."""
4,It serves its purpose,"This is a small dictionary that I have used extensively in my long struggle with the Czech language. It's small enough and cheap enough to be carried around easily and gives you a ton of words to learn whenever you get the chance. I use my huge Czech printed dictionaries for more intensive home study and take this book around wherever I go. I recommend it along with other works by this author. (By the way, other reviewers really need to loosen up, what do you really expect out of a small abridged dictionary that can be had in a used English language book store for kc50?)"
2,very basic,This is a VERY basic dictionary. It is set with a single simple font and doesn't have much help if any for common phrases or usage. Just basic word with a list of translated words. It is nothing close to what I have for Spanish. It is better than nothing and cheap.
2,Let's just pretend this never happened..,"I'm such a huge Shreve fan that I preordered this book months in advance and couldn't wait until it came. After reading about 75 pages, it became a chore. The details are so cliche-a group of college friends reunited, old loves lost and refound, a dear friend who died, etc. Then there is a bizarre second storyline about an explosion in Halifax at the turn of the century. That,along with strangly placed references to 9/11 throughout the book made me want to cry (with disappointment).Anita, I'll wait for your next one, but this time without bated breath."
2,What's Going On Here?,"Did Anita Shreve promise her publisher to a book of so-many pages? Is that why the Halifax disaster novel of Agnes is included? Or, is it there as a clumsy attempt to mirror 9/11? Whichever, it is, it fails! I would have liked to learn more about the other characters, Jerry, etc.I'm the type of reader who usually finishes a book, no matter how painful...and I finished this one. I had to, as I had just stopped at Day 5 in ""Ten Days in the Hills."" I couldn't fail on two consecutive reads.If you haven't purchased this book, don't! If you have, save it for the beach."
1,Boring and inconsistent,I listened to this on CD in the car and believe me if I hadn't been on a long trip and needed something to listen to I would have stopped withing the first few chapters. There is only one or two characters worth liking and rooting for (the couple marrying) The rest are sniveling idiots and the story withing the story is so predictable. Ms Shreve also needs an editor for the inconsistencies within the story. A little more research please
2,Very few strong points,"The premise of this book sounded very interesting, and probably could have been. However, you instead suffer through a very slow beginning and middle, only to in the end be disappointed with unresolve. The book does contain some interesting scenarios, such as the Halifax disaster, the struggle with cancer, and the ""butterfly effect"" of the past, but these high points are overshadowed by a slow pace and abrupt ending."
2,Read a different novel,"This author has written good books but this isn't one of them. There are several different stories woven though this novel, and none of them are fully fleshed out... except the adultery. Every couple is adulterous or abusive or both, and frankly it gets old and boring by the middle of the book. Because the author doesn't fully illuminate and resolve any of her plot threads, (unless the entire point of the book is that all relationships are pointless and doomed) this book ends with a dud. The book is not really not worth the time it takes to read. Select one of the author's other books or read something else entirely."
4,Nearly 4 stars...,"This is not a strong Shreve book, as others have indicated. However, I should hope first-time Shrevers reconsider not picking up any of her other novels. This isn't Strange Fits of Passion, The Weight of Water, or Fortune's Rocks. Still, it is engaging, timely, and relatable to most adults. I did really enjoy Agnes' secondary plot of the Halifax explosion, perhaps a bit more than the reunion tale itself. That short story could make a nice novel."
1,Good story idea never developed,"Shreve took FOREVER to tell this story, and she told it very poorly. The characters were cardboard figures...shallowly developed. And what was the point of the novel within the novel? This book disapppointed me!!"
2,...and I am a Shreve fan,"I have read almost all of her books and this one was just not one of her best. It took all my effort to get through it and the only reason I didn't put it down is because I am a fan of hers. I wouldn't recommend this book, however I highly recommend Anita Shreve as an author."
2,can't even finish it!,"I'm a Shreve fan and was SO looking forward to her new book but it doesn't flow well for me and I just can't seem to get into it after reading 1/2 the book already! The characters blend into each other and one writes a story ~ perhaps the story within the story is confusing to me and I can't get past that. Anyway, I give up and am disappointed. LIGHT ON SNOW, her recent book was better. If you need a great Shreve book to read, go for FORTUNE'S ROCKS! That's my alltime fav of hers."
1,La la la...connect the dots...PLEASE!,"I was very disappointed in Shreve's latest effort.This book is so disjointed, with: characters I never came to care about, men speaking in a woman's voice (I kept thinking - come on - what guy talks like this?), a bizzarre interjected story one of the characters is writing (which just made me go - huh? and skip over it), strange dialogue about 9/11, and a weird supposed cliff-hanger ending, which made me think - who really cares? These self-involved idiots need to get better excuses to cheat on their spouses than former infatuation, even if it was around a tragedy - grow up! This was a throw it across the room when you're finished reading it book."
1,Pompous dribble,"I loved the Pilot's Wife, so I thought this might be an interesting one to read as well. I was sadly mistaken. The dialogue is stilted and unrealistic. The understory written by Agnes is a distraction, and the bottom line is I just didn't care about any of the characters when it was all said and done. I really felt as though Shreve's goal was to impress me with her amazing vocabulary and make these people seem as haughty and pretentious as possible. Now I'm not sure I'd like any of her other books. Ick."
3,disappointing...,"I have enjoyed several of Anita Shreve's other books so much more. This one pales in comparision with so many of her other works. while the Halifax sections are interesting and compelling,most of the other story lines seem contrived and a bit forced. There are, of course, all of the classic stock characters here and everyone seems to stick pretty firmly to their stereotype which is a shame. And the ""shocking secrets"" are not all that shocking or suprising or engrossing for that matter. This book does not feel like it took a lot of effort. And it is not up to her usual standards. I am sorry to have to say this too. I was looking forward to it, but I plodded through most of it and was not sorry to finish it."
2,depressing,This book was depressing. I read it with my book club and I found it boring and sad. I love to read books more than one time but this one I threw away.
2,This book feels like a parody of Anita Shreve's better work,"All of the elements that make ""The Weight of Water,"" ""The Pilot's Wife"" and ""The Last Time They Met"" compelling are there: the sense of longing, of what might have been, haunting memories, sensuality, unresolved and unrequited first loves. But perhaps because so many of the characters are experiencing these same feelings at once, there's a feeling of overkill and emptiness to it all. ""Wedding,""in fact, almost reads like a caricature of the Shreve we know and love. It was interesting, theoretically, to observe the parallels in this book, the same formula for a relationship repeating itself again and again. But the characters felt hollow, perhaps because they were all asked to share the same basic conflict and plot. Harrison in particular annoyed me...I thought he was shallow and self-indulgent."
2,Trite themes and shallow characters,"I am not a *huge* fan of Shreve's to begin with, but I usually at least find her books entertaining and thougtful (like Light on Snow). But this one was not even good. The idea that we can't get past our high-school first loves to the point that we would all have disfunctional future relationships is trite. The implicit defense of infidelity in the face of the seemingly overwhelming pull of these shallow first infatuations is just sad. Please. I didn't marry the first guy I had a crush on, but I have more insight in myself and perspective on those immature first relationships and respect for my husband and kids than to jump in bed with the first old flame I meet at a reunion or event of mutual old friend. Not worth reading. I only even gave it 2 stars because the subplot of the halifax disaster was at least mildly entertaining, even if it made absolutlely no sense in light of the larger story."
2,"The Big Chill - W/O the humor, compassion, etc.","I have to agree with other reviewers that this book was a big dud. The dialog was stilted, there was little character development, the ""big secret about that night"" was very anticlimactic. The only characters I really cared about were in Agnes' backstory. I would have read that book."
4,Wonderfully descriptive,"I always enjoy the descriptive writing style of Ms. Shreve. If you like weddings or reunions you should consider reading this. There are secrets that beg to be told. Who tells and who keeps them for another time and place is what makes the pages turn. With the detailed, descriptive writing and dialogue that captures every nuance of temperament, you will surely enjoy this story."
1,pretty pointless and definitely boring,"Shreve may have had a good idea with what she WANTED the point to be, but the book never makes it there. Definitely not worth the time I spent trying to get into it."
3,Okay but not great.,"The last book I read by Shreve was Light on Snow which was a better novel than this one.While I enjoyed A Wedding in December to some extent, I didn't think that the story went anywhere. Like so many other reviewers here I kept waiting for something to happen. While I realize that the book is about looking back and seeing the road you traveled versus the one you may have missed, I expected a little more from the story overall."
3,"Get over it, please","I will begin by saying I am a big fan of Anita Shreve. However, I am not a big fan of this book. I could not care for any of these self-absorbed characters. Their dialogue was so stilted and unreal -- nobody converses like Harrison, Nora, et al. (Harrison actually used the word ""shat"" in a conversation! as in ""He shat himself""!) The major theme of infidelity became tiresome, and the story line just seemed implausible. I will read other novels of Shreve, though, because the good are sooo good, such as Fortune's Rocks. This one is just not her best effort."
3,My Least Favorite Shreve Book - Here's Why,"My biggest problem with this novel is the ""story in the story"" part. One of the characters, Agnes, is writing a novel based on the Halifax disaster or something (never heard of it, was it a real disaster?), and occasionally the book veers off into this second story as she is writing it. I never could figure out the relevance of this to ""A Wedding In December."" It should have been struck out by the editors as frivilous and distracting. The real plot of the book was fairly interesting, but a bit contrived. Who would invite a bunch of high school friend, most of whom they'd not seen in many years or even never since their teens, to a wedding twentysome years later. Only a couple of relatives are included, no current friends or coworkers. Too unrealistic. I enjoyed Shreve's other books, but this one is barely OK. Sorry"
1,Sooooo disappointed,"I'm an Anita Shreve fan, and this book was so disappointing. The characters were so unbelievable and totally undeveloped. I kept struggling through it in the hopes that it would redeem itself, but no, it was one huge disappointment. Not up to the standards of her other works."
2,Uninteresting characters,"I really don't find these characters worth knowing. This bunch of prep school alumni have ended up in predictably artsy/intellectual careers yet come through as vacuous both intellectually and morally. They keep invoking 9/11 and a classmate's death for instant (read cheap) emotional impact. The dialogues between Harrison and Nora are so meaningful as to be insipid. Compare this to any Anne Tyler novel, where the characters can be perfectly bland but are somehow worthwhile... at least interesting... striving after something real, human, and decent rather than merely urbane.Rereading the above, I'm shocked by the harshness but stand by it. Remembering that it takes 100x as much talent to produce a poor novel as a superb critique. Nevertheless, I find the story lightweight in technique and theme."
2,Not an interesting read,"I thought this was poorly written over all. It's a rehash of ""The Big Chill"" for younger boomers. The characters are boring-most of them are involved in extra-marital affairs in one way or another, and none seem to have a conscience about it. And they are obsessed about a schoolmate who died more than 25 years ago. I lost several friends when I was a teen and young adult. While I occasionally miss them and talk about them with my surviving friends, none of us are obsessed with any of them. I kept wanting to say ""get over it and move on"".I like books that make one think. This book makes me fear for America if her portrait of self-absorbed middle-aged adults reflects any thing!"
2,This is my 2nd Anita Shreve novel...,and I can't say I am overly thrilled....I leave feeling there are many questions unanswered and almost irritated. I feel the context is good but the ending poor!
3,Not her best,I've read many of Anita Shreve's books and found most of them interesting. This one was a disappointment. A better read of hers would be some of her earlier stuff.
2,DISAPPOINTING,"This book starts out with a bang and gradually fizzles out. I had the feeling that she lost interest in the characters and plot and just wanted to finish writing it. I kept reading it with expectation but was sorely disappointed as the plot deteriorated into a boring, silly narration."
3,Entertaining at best...,"I purchased this book while on vacation and based on the author's previous reviews and reputation. I found it entertaining at best. The characters were one dimensional, the plot and story predictable, and the story itself unbelievable. The main mystery was revealed at the end, and I read and re-read it thinking, THAT IS IT...THE BIG MYSTERY PLOT TWIST HAS BEEN REVEALED...I HAVE BEEN HANGING ON FOR THIS? This is a book that I WOULD pass on to a friend. BUT, wouldn't hang on to for a future re-read."
3,Anita Shreve,I have read all of Anita Shreve's books and this perhaps is not my favorite...Please do not this discourage yourself from reading her other books which are great!!Eden CloseFortune RocksResistanceStrange Fits of PassionSea Glass
4,don't give up on this...,".....it's a little slow in the beginning & I think that this time Shreve spent too much time on little insignificant details.... "" he buttoned his shirt, stood up, found his shoes...."" things like that were in abundance. But again, like so many of her other books she has two stories going at once with similar subject matter and the characters are ones you want to get to know. This is not the best Anita Shreve, but ""spoiler alert"" - I'd love to know what others think Harrison did after leaning against the rental car at the end - did he drive away for good? I hope not."
2,Am not encouraged to read any other Shreve novels,"This was the first Anita Shreve book that I have read, and I am certainly not dying to read more by her. There is no real story, nothing happens and I couldn't care less about the characters. What a disappointment. I'm glad someone gave me the book and I didn't pay for it!"
5,Brilliant!,"Until now, Fortune Rocks was my favorite Anita Shreve book, but it has just been exceeded by A Wedding in December. The storyline of a high school clique who went their separate ways after gradution and are reuniting 27 years later for a wedding is highly appealing because I could personally relate to it. The characters were approximately the same age and facing the same midlife crisises as me. I saw parts of myself and my own struggles in each of them, particularly Agnes. I loved the setting, a classy country inn owned by one of the main characters located in Massachusetts Birkshire Mountains. Anita Shreve's brilliant writing style and attention to detail prevailed throughout. This book had very high expectations and it didn't disappoint! I highly recommend it to all, but mostly especially to women in their 40's."
2,soooooo boring,this book is sooo boring. The ending is not well done and there is no climax at all. i couldnt wait for this book to be done
2,What a disappointment........,"I was so looking forward to Anita Shreve's next book, as I have read everything she has written. I wanted to love this story, but couldn't even like it. I am half way through the book at this point and will probably not finish it. The story within the story that Agnes is writing ruins the original story which seems to drag in any case. Oh well, maybe next book..........."
3,A decent read,"While this is not Shreve's best (and I have read all of her books), it's not bad, either. Other reviewers have commented that it seems to glorify adultery, but I found it to be a story that approaches married life as it often is -- OK. Don't we all have someone in our past that we wonder about? Don't we all sometimes play around with ""what if""? Don't we all sometimes just make the decision to stay with what we have committed to?All in all, a good read."
3,It was a downer... but closer to realife than we would like,"I read the book for my book club. The book made for great discussion but it was not an enjoyable read. I really had to push myself to pick up the book over and over again. The Agnes character was pathetic and sad, then her extra writing or rambling about Helloifax was a huge distration from the great development of charaters in the book. I will not be seeking out another Anita Shreve book anytime too soon."
3,Too long to set the table.,"A wedding is celebrated, and the only invitees are members of the same high school class, although it is now over 25 years since graduation. The explanation is that two high school sweethearts, whose romance was cut short, are finally marrying. The book asks this question: what do you do if you are married to someone other than the great love of your life. The answer is that children, unless grown, come first, but it is OK to carry on a secret affair. ""A Wedding in December"" is not one of Shreve's better efforts. The inn owner, a major character, does not really come to life, and the same can be said about several of the secondary characters. Worse, it takes entirely too long to ""set the table"". Once the players start interacting at the inn, the book picks up steam. I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the parallel story within a story about the Canadian eye specialist: good writing triumphs over an unpromising plot."
2,Very Slow,"I do have all of her books and like her as an author, however this one fell short. It takes place over 2 days so that right there tells you it's a slow mover. Unfortunately the subject matter isn't exactly a mood lifter either. But I know they all can't be :( I do think this book may resonate better with people in that age group, perhaps in your 40's and 50's. Maybe that was all it was for me. I just couldn't really relate. I don't think you get the chance to know the characters very well given the short amount of time in the book. There are some sub plots but it is just very choppy and doesn't quite fulfill you in the end."
2,Reads like a first draft,"I have never read Shreve before and thought I'd give this a try. I love literary fiction, both contemporary and otherwise, and can appreciate books that are slow-paced and purposeful. That said, this was slow-paced, but by accident. Characters spend all their time thinking and rethinking, yet they still come off one-sided. There is no one to root for. So much drama and attempts at heart wrenching, and yet I didn't care what happened to anyone in this book.I read a review that said this seemed like Shreve took all her unused story ideas and put them in here, and I couldn't agree more.There wore some beautiful phrases in this book and some potentially good ideas, but most of it was drivel. It needs serious revising. I gave it two stars because I finished it, which I guess means I found something redeeming in it."
2,"Dry, dull read","I've enjoyed a few of Shreve's works but this one lacks imagination and emotional intensity. It also contains the most preposterous literary device I've ever seen. The idea of a man, in the age of internet and cell phones, sitting down in a hotel room to hand write a seven page letter to his wife (which conveniently sets up the plot and fills in all the background) is just absurd. I was embarrassed for the author."
2,I actually reshelved this one less than 1/2 way through!,"This book was hard to get into, right from the beginning. I forced myself to read about 1/4 of the way through just in case it got better, but it did not. Finally I admitted that I did not care about any of the characters, and some I just plain didn't like. Not sure what Innes was all about; there were enough characters in the REGULAR story without adding a completely different story inside of this one. I did want to see what happened, so I skipped to the end, realized it was as bad as the beginning, and put the book in the ""sell to Half Price Books"" pile."
3,Wedding in December,"I think the book description is a little misleading. I thought the novel would focus more on the 25th reunion that brought these two high school lovers back together, but that was rarely touched on, maybe only a few sentences. The rest centers around the group of friends as they all get together for the wedding. It's told from various points of view, which I enjoyed and made for interesting reading. Also goes through a lot of flash backs. What's odd is that one of the characters herself is writing a novel, which was too boring for me, so I skipped all those pages and just stuck with the story at hand."
2,"a good writer, a lousy book","what happened to anita shreve? i used to love her -now it seems like they will publish anything she writes, so she's stopped trying. instead of telling one story well, she tells nine stories poorly. woven together are totally disconnected narratives (including a ww2 era tangent) that never fit together. i didn't care about these characters. the dialogue is just plain awful. the story is predictable and melodramatic."
4,"Reinventing history, and the future, at a class reunion","I've been reading several class-reunion novels lately, and this one stands out. The delicacy, the unerring accuracy, of the portrayals of old friends who are changed yet unchanged, by a couple of decades apart is compelling. Successes and tragedies, trauma shared and unshared, personal definitions all are reinterpred, and in some cases, blown apart with Anita Shreve's sure hand. I especially liked Agnes, the spinster-teacher-secret lover of a professor they all knew and admired. She writes her alternate endings out in fiction, raising the inevitable question as to how much of this story might draw on the author's own life, real or wished-for."
2,Not An Inspiring Book,"I have been somewhat of a fan of Shreve but I did not find this book one that I would pass on to friends with much excitement. I found the characters gossipy and critical of these supposedly good friends from high school - good enough friends that they would gather some 27 years later for a second wedding of two of the classmates. The constant appraisal of what each one was wearing or how they looked was disconcerting - especially coming from a male friend of the group. I thought the book was depressing with no redeeming value. I finished it in two days, however, which tells how caught up I was in the story. It was the aftertaste that bothered me."
5,My toddler loves this,This toy is something my toddler eats drinks sleeps with. Carries it to his daycare. everywhere actually. Of the gazillion toys he has he prefers this any time. Its soft...durable...and bigger than most other superman toys. Worth a lot more than the $10 I paid for it.
4,Good toy,"My grandson has so much fun with this superman. It is soft and can be made to ""fly"" so it is not like the typical super hero doll."
2,Rust.,I purchased the toothbrush holder and soap dispenser to this set.This review is for the toothbrush holder. The piece works fine and does look nice. It holds 2 larger toothbrushes and could hold a couple of tubes of paste.My displeasure was with the rust staining. If the bottom gets wet you are then left with a rust stain on the vanity. It is going to get wet since we use it near a sink.Another issue I have is with space consumption. I have limited counter space on my vanity. This product does not make the best use of space as the bottom flares out while the actual holder part is smaller.Please see my review for the soap/lotion dispenser.
3,Lots of rust,I bought this product because it was the only thing I liked that would hold 2 toothbrushes and toothpaste. Well it does what it is supposed to BUT if you keep it on the sink it WILL leave rust stains. I had to move it to another place which is why I gave it a 3 star rating. I also had a matching soap dispenser which I ended up throwing out because of the rust.
4,I love this simple and elegant toothbrush holder,"I've been very pleased with my purchase of the Steeltek Hampton Chrome and Ceramic Toothbrush Holder. I really like the aesthetic. I'm no decorator, but my bathroom has chrome fixtures and classic ceramic tile, so it looks great in there. I know some other reviews have had trouble with rust stains, but this has not been the case for me. In fact, it seems like if it was going to happen to anyone it would happen to me because with a small child and messy adult members of our family, water is constantly splashed on our counter. Luckily we haven't had any issues."
3,Toothbrush holder review,This toothbrush holder is sturdy and looks great with our other pieces. The only problem is that the base is felt so it can't go in the dishwasher.
4,Some Young Moon,"So many times I find myself describing movies, books or music to friends in terms of ""what it's like"". Well, when it comes to Young's Astronauts in Trouble, I just can't do it. I can tell you what it's not like... it's not like anything else I have ever read and not being a ""space"" enthusiast it seemed to hold little for me, at least on the surface. I guess that's why we have the old adage about not judging a book by it's cover.So many things are going on here, is it sci-fi? After all we are dealing with space travel (and cows!).How about intrigue? A millionaire industrialist is planning a covert colonization of the moon.Murder mystery? Yes people are dying and due to a radical element attempting to sabotage the rocket launchings even more my do so.And did I say there are cows ...in space!This book is entertaining, inventive and most definitely worth your attention."
5,Read this book!,On of the best stories I've read in along time. Larry Young does an excellent job of creating interesting characters and binding them to a well written story. You can tell the love that Larry has for the subject material it shows in the detail he uses and the plans he's created. His sense of dialog is great. This is the kind of book that makes you want to see man go to the Moon again.A Great story with excellent art. Highly recommended.
4,Serviceable,"My ears do not touch the inner padding as another reviewer mentioned.These headphones are big and comfy against my head, but a little heavier than I would prefer. The sound is perfectly serviceable considering the price. I wouldn't buy this model for extended periods of use; more than an hour of these and the weight starts to give me a headache.The noise cancellation is good quality. Sometimes I put these when they're unplugged, just to drown out other noises in the office."
2,Looks nice but it isnt at all !,"I bought Labtec 835 going by the reviewws , but now i have stopped believeing reviews and specificationgs...., these headfone are bad , no real volume with clarity , sick bass , i mean only u can listen to something like a lecture ...! good thing, these headfones are real comfortable !But then pay 16 $ for that ??? Pay a little more and get something better !I didnt like these headfones at all ! If u r a music lover, u wont like them , dont buy them ! else u regret...."
1,Big Stinker,"This movie is bad,bad,bad. Terrible picture quality , but then again, it is over30 years old and really, It should be ""Put to rest"".."
4,Good for new coach,This is a good book for a new lax coach at the youth level. Not for an experienced coach or someone who wants to take things to the next level. Provides basics of the game and running a team. Better than most books of this type.
2,there are better books available,"This book is a welcome addition to the lack of material on lacrosse, but it doesn't add much depth to the subject and is not very useful as a reference or as a tool for coaches. I would recommend Dave Pietramala's book over this one, hands down."
3,book satisfactory/ box open,"Hi,the book seemed fine, but the box was open and the pages turned back alittle."
2,wheres the beef?,"Although this book is well written, it really focuses on very basic lacrosse. My hope was it would be deeper on drills and place some emphasis on advanced techniques and strategies.Lacrosse coaches are starved for better information on rides, clears, running plays and defensive twists such as junk D and zones.Im not complaining, any new books on this subject are badly needed."
3,Nice for home....not that nice for outside use...,"...Good chooise for home, not that good outside home!....I use this headphones at home, wen I am at my computer, watching TV or a movie, o when listening music at my stereo. The headphones have a nice and comfortable padding for you ears, they don't get hot, neither hurts. The Long cord (plus the extension it has) makes them ideal to watch TV or a movie in you bed. They include a switch, Movie and Music, you choose in which mode you are on, depending what are you listening, a movie or music. All these features makes them great if you plan to use them at HOME. Now, their huge size makes them to difficult to carry, and they have no noise-cancelling...the noice cancelled is due to music or sound coming out form the headphones plus their huge size around you ears, but its minimal sound what is cancelled...plus you look a little weird (thats a joke)...Good chooise for home, not that good outside home!"
4,Quality over quantity,"The lows are low and clear, the highs are unmistakable and I don't think you can ever blow them out..... The 1 problem I have with them is the earcups don't swivel and I've always been a big fan of that feature.... The wire is covered in cloth making it very easy to manage but still keeping it very strong. The movie music switches aren't labeled and so far make no difference.... While HUGE they are light, comfortable, and the drivers can be pushed by an ipod without any want for more power"
3,decent phones,they are a decent set for the price iv had them bout a month now they sound great but are big-bulky you dont wear them as a fashion statement thats for sure i use them mainly to listen to movies and music after hrs in my house i have small children my ears do tend to get hot an hr or so in to watchin a movie or music i wish they were like my older sony set but oh well all and all there fine id give a 4-5 if they werent so bulky and hot in all honesty i would'nt buy them again or i would have returned them if i had a back up pair at the time.. ~still work great a year later 2-7-09
3,Sony MDR-XD400,"These headphones are the best for the price, bar-none. However, you do get what you pay for. I had these headphones for 6 months when a short occured in the cord, which could only be fixed by contorting and bending the cord at different angles. Then a month later I was listening to my personal C.D. player when they blew out. With an advertised power capacity of 3,000 milliwatts this should not have occured. They are quite comfortable albiet a little rediculous in appearance. These headphones would be great for home use only, but as for everyday use they just were not built well enough."
3,Worth the price,The headphones sound good but they are heavier than I anticipated. I can't wear them for long periods of time without letting my ears breath.
4,Pretty good so far,"These are my first set of high-quality headphones and I have really enjoyed having them so far (about a month). The sound is amazing and they are very comfortable even with my really big head.My one worry is that the material used for the ear-cups seems very thin. It hasn't torn so far, but it seems like only a matter of time. We will have to see...Great so far!"
5,Great Headphones!,"I bought this as a Xmas present after reading the great reviews - and everyone is right! The headphones are very comfortable, the sound is great and the extra long cable is cloth coded so it doesn't get caught on things cluttered on the desk. Recommend!"
5,awesome headphones,these headphones sound so good you will never want to listen to your stereo through your speakers again. i love the extended cord so i can lie in bed and listen to my stereo at night especially those sleepless nights. the magnets on these headphones are huge to produce the awesome sound and extra solid bass that you can actually feel when you crank up the volume a little. i do not know if other headphones out there have magnets this big.do not hear them at high volume cuz they are very powerful. they fit very comfortable. i highly recommend these headphones to anyone out there that likes to listen to music through headphones
5,Excellent detail and exposure of secret intelligence data,"Carr who worked in intelligence during WW2 reveals data which is not available from other current sources. His detailed footnotes and sources leads to even more details. His accounts of events concurs with other reliable sources and without taking an opinion of his own, except in the last chapter, he walks the reader step by step through the dis-information offered as history by the western media and state sponsored shool text books."
5,This book esplains how evil fights good and can win,"The book takes you to the begining, and showing how financiers and their trades tools have fomented and will continue to foment national and international crisis."
3,Both interesting and disappointing,"Pawns in the Game makes many valid points, especially about the fact that the world's monetary system has been taken over and is being run by private corporations which, because this system creates all our money in the form of interest-bearing debt owed to these corporations, means that ""the more money we have, the deeper in debt we are."" All of which is true.The disappointing part is that the book seems to put the entire blame for this system on the Jewish people as a people, instead of blaming the specific individual who were to blame, some of whom were Jewish and many who were not."
2,The Shaft,"I caught this movie by mistake and the synopsis of the film sounded good. While the local video store was going out of buisness, I found it under drama. Well known actors like Naomi Watts (The Ring) and Ron Perlman (Hellboy) star in this mess. The film is way to long and parts of it doesnt even make sense. The killings are bad as you can tell all were done poorly with CGI. The last death with the man getting his legs crushed did look pretty good. I do not recommend this to anyone. Killer elevators sounds like a good idea but trust me, this movie isnt worth the time."
1,A potentially good premise shot to hell,"A number of years ago there was a film ""The Lift"" which was also about a demonic elevator.It was much better than this one.This, I think, could have been a decent film but it fails completely."
1,The Shaft -- as in giving us the . . .,"Remember that scene in Big where Tom Hanks is in a meeting at his new job, playing with the transformer building -- the building that turns into a robot?This movie is as dopey as that building-bot. Bad acting, and one of the worst plot devices ever. Wow. It doesn't get much worse than this. An artificially intelligent elevator turned evil -- pure concentrated evil!Actually, there was an X Files episode along these lines that got it right, but this doesn't. Some cool actors in an abysmal movie. No camp, no suspense, and pointless gore."
2,Good time killer,"The only reason I really rented this was because of Naomi Watts, after loving her performances in the Ring and Mulholland Drive, I decided to check it out, it seemed good enough. Boy was I wrong, Shaft pulls one of those have Naomi's pictures in the title letters thing. That had to be taken from the Ring cover. Anyway, Naomi's role is basically a supportive one and her character is almost identical to hers in the Ring. Naomi did her best she could with the [crummy] dialogue but it is so obvious that she didn't even want to be on the set. The male lead is just horrible, I had to laugh. There were some cool death scenes, my favorite being the skater boy. Poor guy. Anyway, like the title says it's a good time killer and like the other reviewer said, there are some good death scenes but other than that, trash it."
2,"Um, well, it's different.","Okay the idea of an elevator killing people at its own free wil is stupid, but some of the death scenes have a plausable occurance. Like the elevator floor breaking off. Two deaths in this movie effected me, the first was the guy who was thrown from the 87 floor and is seen splatter on the ground, the other was when the elevator floor collapsed and we see kids that are like 5 years old fall to their death. Why did these effect me? Wel they brought back bad flashbacks of 9/11. You know people jumping from windows and stuff. So if were on the spot were 9/11 occured, I strongly recomend not seeing this. But for the rest of us, well the acting is terrible, so is the dialogue (I mean how many times do they really need to use the F word?), and the whole premise of a computer ship made from human cells being put into an elevator and coming to life is just plain stupid. So for a cheeze fest with some decent gore, this is the movie to see."
4,"Excellent book, but takes time to understand it.","Concise book, but shows the necessary ideas. Reading carefully, I come to know how the author describe contents with the minimum use of words. At the same time, many expressions are too neat, and I have to refer the other books to understand the topic. Good textbook, but not for self-study."
5,Most underrated blues master.,"There is another title similar to this ""Bluebird Recordings 1941-1942"". Those two collections depict Maceo's fabulous and innovative blue piano style. One of the best blue piano recordings by post-War Chicago blues giant."
1,Bad SciFi,"If you liked Encounter With Tiber and Patton's Spaceship, don't even think about buying this book. I liked all the timeline wars books, so I got this one. Unlike a previous reviewer, I read the whole thing but by the end, I was sorry the hero survived into at least one more book."
1,Well I thought I would like it....,"Before ordering the guide I thought it was a great idea to be in binder format so that I could add my own stuff to it as well. Upon receiving it however I've changed my mind. Not only is the binder cheap in its construction, it is awkward to boot!I was disappointed with the content as well... I don't think it gave me anything new of any substance; it is basically a rehash of everything that is either in the CoV manual or online in the official forums.Quite some time ago when I bought City of Heroes (just before release), I also ordered the Prima guide for it... although a lot of the information was basic, it was hands down better than the CoV binder guide!"
1,"Sad Prima, Sad","As with the City of Heros book this one was a great idea and then Prima in their great marketing skills decided to not print updates for customers. My children love the book and use it constantly, but now that a new update is out it is getting out dated. Don't buy it because you can't print the updates at a reasonable cost."
5,A man who saw them in So Paulo.,"This live album was realy a great surprise. It is better than ""Manowar live"", wich has a poor recording quality, and bring us some classics in great performances. ""The Power"", recorded from the performance of Brazil, is perfect. They certainly are the ""Kings of Metal""."
4,Smart shamus in Cheshire,"It's too bad Val McDermid's mysteries are so difficult to find in the U.S., because she's a terrific writer, and Kate Brannigan is a terrific private eye. ""Kick Back"" is the first of the Brannigan series and can be addictive. Based in the county of Cheshire in England (near Manchester), the very cool Kate encounters all manner of English dirty dealing and bad Chinese food. Every time I go to London, I pick up whatever new Val McDermid paperbacks are available, with Kate the first priority."
5,This is the real New England.,"Cottage for Sale,Must Be Moved is a unique insight into the character of the New Englander. While this type of book is not my usual fare, I found it to be totally delightful, insightful, and witty. My wife recommended ""cottage"" after reading it twice. I resisted reading it at first because I thought it is a ""chick book"". Now I'm happy I did and I give copies as gifts to my less fortunate non-new england friends. Kate's humor warms our Maine winter."
5,There's genius in the details,"Whouley moved more than a cottage, she moved mountains of regulatory boards and commissions to get permission to patch a cottage onto her tiny house on Cape Cod. It took guts to get through the toughest wetlands regulations in the country. Here's how a pro did it.You can't help falling in love with this determined woman who loves her neighbors, fights for her chickens, listens to her cat and longs for a sweet, handy guy to fill that little extra space in her life."
4,Nice surprise,I enjoyed all aspects of this book and have great admiration for the woman who put her life on paper so candidly. I won this book at a book festival--so glad I did!
4,Health Care Plans,This book is a valuable tool for school nurses. It would be better if it could be shared. The CD can only be downloaded on one laptop and it is expensive to buy 6 for all our school nurses in this economy
5,"""OMAR"" is one exciting thriller!","I picked up the new novel about terrorism called ""OMAR"" by Craig O. Thompson, at the Arizona Book Festival. It is one of the most intelligent reads I've purchased in years. More than just the blood and guts that most bottom-line, leveraged buyout publishers seem to throw at us, these days, ""Omar"" gave me thoughtful passages and carefully threaded stories to unite the plot (which deals with terrorism under the Atlantic and a very famous sunken ship). I would compare to the best of Cussler and Clancy."
5,Outstanding page-turner,"It's always difficult to review the work of a friend (for obvious reasons), but in this case it was an absolute delight! OMAR is an exciting, thought-provoking novel that Craig O. Thompson has painstakingly researched down to the last detail. The characters are multi-faceted, the plot is complex without being confusing, the action sequences are fast-paced and descriptive, and the details show incredible knowledge of the subject matter without being pompous. OMAR puts the reader in the story from page one. If you like the idea of the depth of Tom Clancy combined with the story-telling ability of Wilbur Smith, OMAR needs to be in your collection. I can't wait for the sequel! By the way, even though Craig is a friend, I BOUGHT this book, so I could review it with a critical eye. I'd suggest it to anyone who loves action adventures."
3,Work Great - Until they don't,"Worked great for almost 1 year. Now I have to wiggle the plug and pull it in and out until I get just the right spot to hear anything. They are cheap enough that one year might be enough, but I was expecting a longer life."
3,Ok,"I thought this movie was okay, but I'm not much of a golfer. My husband liked it much more than I did, and we bought it for my father-in-law who is a major golfer."
2,A Disappointment,"After the lukewarm Contender, the long-awaited Walk On Fire, proves Royal Crown wants to get as far away from their ""swing"" roots as possible. The lounge influences here just do not work. Eddie's vocals are really weak. Buy Kings Of Gangster Bop or Mugzy's Move for true RCR."
2,I'm Sorry,"I really wanted to like this CD, I really did. There's just one problem, it isn't that good. Now I know all about it I read all about how they used vintage insturments and recording equipment to get that special sound. It's just that the special sound doesn't work. It sounds to much like they are playing in some dump of a bar filled with smoke and drunks, and the songs don't work for me. They lost the edge they had on the previous two albums. What happened"
1,Poor Effort,"This is not swing! Royal Crown puts on record and attests to what awful musicians they are with this release. ""Walk On Fire"" leaves no doubt in listener's minds why Warner dropped them faster than the Macarena."
5,"File this one under, great music","People seem to get so caught up this whole swing thing. RCR is not a swing band, they are a band who swings. Swing is not about lindy tempo dances beats, loud horns or zoot suits.Swing is a feeling, an attidute, and a way of carrying yourself musically. Wynton Marsalis is always talking about ""the swing, the swing, the swing.""RCR is hands down my favorite band. Period. I have had the honor of meeting the guys in the band a few times after concerts, and these guys did not get caught up in the whole swing craze, because they didn't want to. They lead all the other pretenders to the pearly gates of gold records, MTV, and Halftime shows. They could have gone that route, but they turned their backs, and went the road less traveled.God bless them for that.I bought this album at 12:01 of the release date, and I was blown away by it.Keep it up, guys."
5,Their Best Yet,"There's nothing to say about this album except ""Amazing!"" Once again RCR proves why they are the best band that is carelessly lumped into the category of ""swing."" Sorry Lindy Hoppers, if you're looking for an album full of songs that sound the same with up tempos, check out Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. This album is so diverse, there's no way I can describe it in such a small space. Thank God they left Warner Brothers so they can do their own thing artistically (they were NOT dropped despite what a previous review stated). The only thing better than this album (which they recorded miraculously in three days!) is hearing them live..check 'em out on their fall tour. To Eddie, James, Daniel, Veikko, Mondo, Bill, and Scott my hats off. A masterpiece."
5,RCR shows what they're really made of.,"No fast driven, hard edged swing/bop. No more stabs at a place in the mainstream. RCR went into the ring on the last album, and fought back against the hype. Walk On Fire is their crowning achievment. Their heavyweight belt. No longer looking to prove themselves to anyone, RCR has finally opened up into their myriad of musical influences. From be-bop (A Bronx Hello), to gritty noir blues (Take a Long Drink for Me) to high powered, blaring grooves like ""Watts Local"" and dark melodic tunes like ""One eyed cat"".The choice is obvious. They paved the way for modern swing, and now their showing everyone that they're still the leaders by once again deviating from current trends and standards."
4,Beware!,"This album is something between Kings Of The Gangster Bop and Mugzy's Move. Royal Crown Revue are still great. The album is not as wild as The Contender. But it's still Royal Crown Revue album. ""The Stranger"", ""She Walks On Fire"" and ""Besame Mija"" are my favourite songs from this album."
1,Didn't Care for the Story,"This book is beautifully illustrated and the concept behind the picture book is creative (similar to ""Where's Waldo"" and liked the notations of the streets in Paris). However, I disliked the story or lack of. Basically, the story follows a boy who lost items throughout the book. There was no climax or resolution. I didn't think this book was well written and returned it."
5,Fabulous,This book is great. Read it to my granddaughter multiple times. I have been to Paris and was enthralled by it. I hope she will want to go some day.
5,Where is Simon?,"Look through a window of imagination to a world of excitement! Adele and Simon takes you to Paris, around the park, through the market, and all the way home! Help Adele find crayons, scarves, hats, and notebooks. The illustrations are amazing and make you feel like you are there! I highly recommend this book and think it is wonderful!"
5,Great book for 4-6 yr olds,This is a great book if you care about not exposing your children to some of the questionable values out there. It is also fun and beautiful.
5,Charming children's book,The illustrations are charming and the simple story line is one even very young children can easily identify with. My toddler granddaughter enjoyed searching for Simon's lost belongings throughout the book.
4,Delightful,This is a delightful book that I purchased for my five year old granddaughter. She enjoys looking for the lost items.Simon keeps loosing his things and imagine my surprise when my granddaughter decided I should be called Simon since I had misplaced my glasses and found them again.
5,Beautifully Illustrated,"I discovered this book at our local book store and fell in love with it immediately. My 3 1/2 year daughter found it equally enthralling and she loves to pick out all the lost items along the tale of the story. The historic locations really set this book apart.What I found most interesting however is the section in the back of the book. It has mini-illustrations of each page and provides information on the location of each backdrop, when things were built, etc., and other historical tidbits, some regarding why children like [that particular park], for example. My daugher loves that section as well and always chooses a couple for me to read aloud to her. It's a great addition to a children's library."
5,Outstanding book in a lovely Parisian setting,This is a wonderful book about a big sister and her little brother who is constantly losing things. What is especially enchanting are the wonderfully detailed illustrations. Look for each lost item on each page. There are also a few of McClintock's hidden surprises within the pages.
5,Great Book,"I bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas. When he first opened it, he saw the cover and gave the book to my sister! Later when I picked it to read he didn't seem interested at all so I told him, I'll read 4 pages and if you don't like it, I'll stop. After the third page he was very excited to get to the next page. He LOVED looking for the lost items and thought it was funny how Simon lost everything he had."
5,Fantastic,"I'm 59 years old and I started taking this about 5 years ago. I had tried all the glucosamine chondroitin products on the market, because I had severe arthritis in both of my thumb joints that was very painful. I also had trigger finger of my right ring finger that snapped painfully every time I used that hand. Within months both were cured and pain-free. I have taken it daily ever since. I only needed one a day and you can take as many as four a day. Two years ago I saw my brother who was considering a carpal tunnel operation. I recommende Arthriflex and he is pain-free and didn't need an operation after taking it several months. The stuff really works, so help me God. I have had to start buying it online, because the store I use to buy it from quit stocking it. I couldn't understand why, because I always bought them out of their supply. Please try it. I feel that it is the added chicken collagen that makes it better than any other product of its kind."
5,Arthriflex Tablets,I've tried every product out there that contains glucosamine & chondroitin but Arthri-flex is the ONLY one that truly WORKS.
5,didn't use yet.,I bought two bottles of this product for my mom who lives in Turkiye. She has terrible knee pains when she stops using this product. She really likes this pills.
2,oa,this product releif joint pains but may need some timHESHeithink not less than a6 months but it may cause some abdominal bloating which can be tolerated dont stop it if no improvment try it for at least 2 years.BEST WISHES FOR IMROVING.
4,Arthri-Flex Review,"Product seems fine, although I have not used it long enough to tell how well it is working."
1,Poor Customer Service for this affiliate,"I have contacted this Amazon affiliate and they did not have the courtesy to reply back. If they don't answer for a purchase inquiry, I wonder how they would resolve a customer issue."
4,Pretty Cool,"This brought me back to my high school days. It's a great mix of REAL alternative bands (I mean alternative before alternative was Top 40). Great Violent Femmes video, They Might Be Giants and The Church. You will really appriciate this video if you remember Dave Kendall- if you don't know who he is doen't bother buying this!"
3,Easy-read application of DSM to congregational dynamics,"Oates gives portraits of individuals with the various DSM personality disorders.Using an accessible and interesting style and keeping jargon to a minimum,he suggests ways to make a tentative assessmentin religious settings and ways for clergy to respond to each disorderin a helpful fashion. Not for those with clinical training, but helpful for those without it."
3,Useful,"The citatations and material are somewhat dated, but they are accurate, relevant, and well researched as far as I can tell. Sometimes the author presents a tone of thinly veiled contempt for the subjects, but this is balanced out well by his own admissions of weaknesses and similar failings. Overall, a good informative book that could be more useful if brought up to date with DSM IV and with a few more modern references. Also, the work could benefit by more information on how to use the knowledge that is imparted, e.g. how people in a wider range of roles might implement plans for self-improvement and helping others. Overall an insight producing easy to read book with a straightforward and appropriately narrowed topic."
2,Annoying and Noisy,"The composer did a great job of putting the exact songs from the movie onto the cd. The reason I gave this two stars is because I don't like the music. They all sound the same and the music gets redundant. Most of the music is crashes and clanks to me. Basically its just noise. I recommend the tracks: Prologue/Main Title/Hockey Mask , Dad's Death/The Pier/Matchbook/ Tina Summons/Dan's Death , and End Credit. The cover art looks like it took 10 minutes to make. If you like the music from these films then get it while you can because its a limited soundtrack. The cover art looks like it took 10 minutes to make."
3,7 Stings and finally a clue.,"This is a great book covering the basics on learning 7 string guitar. I think a good knowledge of 6 string is necessary, but this book is written and approaches the 7 as a true-whole-instrument, not just a 6 with a low B. Great for getting you going quick with some power chords and even getting into theory and has licks and some ""outside"" approaches to playing the 7. This is a fountain book , not a straight through read, and be prepared to take your time to digest the info--lots here. Well presented, clear and inspirational."
3,Star Wars: Boba Fett 1: The Fight to Survive,"Star Wars: Boba Fett #1: The Fight to Survive, by Terry BissonThis Boba Fett series is aimed at younger readers, but as Boba Fett is one of my favorite Star Wars characters, I read everything I can find on him. This is book one of a six book series.""The Fight to Survive"" covers the events of the film, ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,"" and expands on Jango's death, Boba's upbringing, life on Kamino, and what Boba did after his father died.The writing is at a 9 to 12 year old level, but I don't think older fans would mind it that much. I'm 24 and enjoying reading a novelization of Boba's younger days, as I don't like comics. There's some touching scenes, and it's fun to read about Boba's transformation from an orphaned ten-year-old to the merciless bounty hunter he is in the future. I can't wait to see what else Jango's black book has to say to Boba.3/5."
5,The Story of Boba Fett,"Being a fan of the Boba Fett character, I could not resist reading this book. Even if it is written for 9-12 year olds, the story holds up well. As an adult reader, the story could be easily modified to be included in the Expanded Universe Star Wars Novel series.The story expands on scenes of Jango and Boba Fett from Episode II. Building on those stories, the story is expanded. Readers learn what happens to Boba Fett after his father dies. A message of responsibility is evident. Obviously this is not as technical as a Star Wars novel which may be a good thing. It is a simple story that a child could enjoy. Even for a story about a ""bad guy"", young readers can enjoy it.I would have no objection to giving this book its projected age group. Particularly the hard to motivate reader who enjoys Star Wars will take quickly to the book. On the other hand, adults will enjoy the story too."
3,Entertaining start,"It's always tough to read a book when you know the start and end from other books or movies. But this one was okay. It bridged some of the gap between some of the clone war stories and the movie where Jango gets killed.Not as engaging as the Republic Camando series by Karen Travis's, but since those never got finished due to Lucasfilm directives you have to read these. I can only hope they get better as the series progresses."
2,Does not work with Wowwee Rovio,I bought this battery for use with the Wowwee Rovio robot. It is the correct size but does not have the same connector. I tried to splice the battery but this has greatly reduced it's battery life and charge. Definitely buy the intended bsttery over this replacement that needs to altered to do half the job.
3,"Stoppers, go where???","Nice looking futon, and seems very comfortable so far. The instructions are terrible, and no mention of customer service or an address so you can actually ask for assistance. I managed to get the thing together with the exception of the stoppers. No mention of these in the two pages of instructions, of course I am obviously missing a sheet since the steps skip from step 2B to 5A! I have concludeed that the stoppers go in one of two possible places. 1. one on the under side of each end to allow for positioning in the lounge position and prevent the seat from sliding out to the bed position. Or 2. put both stoppers on the under side of the center rail to allow for positioning in the lounge position and also the sofa position. I'm leaning towards option 2 since the instructions show three positions: sofa, lounge, and the bed. I plan to visit the store again, they had one put together there, so I'm going to check it out."
3,Nice idea,"Got this with a cast iron dutch oven. This is a really nice idea and does appear to help but my oh my, what a pain to clean with all the little holes."
5,works great,"I love this trivet it works great in my 5 quart cast iron dutch oven . Its very simple just insert in bottom of pan or dutch oven place meat on top , cover , place in oven and voila the grease and juices will drip from your meat and into the small area the trivet made . so simple yet so effective . I have slowly replaced almost all of my kitchen ware with lodge . Lodge is sturdy , easy to maintain and super strong . Please note you must always coat your cast iron cookware after every use . there is no getting around it . if you do not it will rust but that will be your fault not the manufacturers . To coat all you have to do is wipe with vegatable oil or crisco or even pam ."
5,Lodge,"Anything by Lodge, I love as I collect cast-iron cook ware and have for a long, long time. It will last our your lifetime and your kids, if taken care of. Can not loose when you invest in cast-iron eventhough it is heavy, it is inexpensive, even heat, and no chipping, etc."
5,Lodge Dutch Oven,"I am amazed at the efficiency of cooking in a covered iron pot. When I prepared my brother's favorite 15 bean soup on the stove top I had it filled at to about 75%, set the heat to med. lo and after the boil it did not spill over. The soup was nice and thick when it was finished. The boys really liked it. Clean-up was a snap with a wire brush, oven dry on 250 for 30 minutes then reseason by the directions.Cooking meat in the oven is just too easy. My roast chicken was such a beautiul brown and the skin was crispy. The meat was moist and falling off the bone. The fat melted off the chicken and in the bottom of the pot. Red meats are fork tender and so juicy...I do brown the meat before cooking. Can't seem to break that habit.Again clean-up is easy. I do think it essential to use a wire brush to be certain of removing all cooked particles and to reseason."
3,TRIVIAL TRIVET,"i bought this as an adaptor for my portable induction cooktop so i could use aluminum pans. it works for warming things but not for high heat cooking. oh, well, i thought it was a good idea at the time. since using it for a time, i am going to give it another star. it works pretty well for an adaptor but do not use it for very high heat sautéing."
3,so-so .... so far,"Got this to use as a heating element on my induction hob for non-induction pans. It split on first use. I have used other Lodge items on the hob. I can only come up with 2 scenarios: 1) this item is not suitable for my intended use 2) I merely received a defective unit. Now that its broken (and past its return date I might add), I am going to just use theLodge Logic Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddleas a heating element. Same concept."
2,Nice but useless,"The three little stubs can be only be considered legs by a person with wild imagination. Grand total height is 1/4"" with half of it being the flat surface with holes and half (1/8"") the legs.Please observe that the happiest users were NOT using it for it's intended purpose. Only ONE was able to use it under the pan and only because they had a plastic (smooth and even) sheet below.Indeed fits like a glove into a Lodge dutch oven.Regret the purchase."
4,Nice idea to have a rack,Be careful how you store it! After washing and oiling you need to store it in a way that gives circulation to it. Don't put it in your pan and cover it! Moisture collects. I use hot pads and store between surfaces.
3,"It's ok, but....","It does what it is supposed to, but looks like a flat piece of metal with holes punched in , with tiny little nubs of metal on the bottom for feet.It is nothing like the nice ones I had 30 yrs ago."
1,Shoddy Manufcturing Process,"While the contents of this volume are well done, the binding is a piece of shoddy work. I was reading the book this morning when ""crack"" the padding of the pages done to bind the thing together(rather than it being sewn)split. I now have a book that is falling apart. That should not happen with a book of this price."
5,Excellent Rockwell Kent Resource,"It is unusual to find such a well researched ,well illustrated,well written book at such a reasonable price.I am buying multiple copies as gifts."
5,Relaxing!,"SILA is a wonderful CD for relaxation. It can be used for meditation, Hypnosis, Tarot and yoga just to mention a few areas. I enjoy this CD everytime I listen to it and I have been playing it for years.Purchase SILA by Chris Theriault and you will be very happy you did!"
5,This album kicks the sh*t out of many other hard core stuff,This album has all the good stuff that hard-core people like. it has hard songs and more. the only bad thing on it was that most of the songs sounded the same. but its no real complaint. I saw them at Krazy Fest and they were awesome.
2,Buried Alive = generic harCDORE!,"Wait this album = What every other mosh/tuffguy band has been doing for the last five years. The lyrics are super cheesy, and to be honest I can't say that this album has accomplished anything. Wow how many bands have preached about veganism before? Lets see.....damn too many for me to count. Another thing Buried Alive aren't straight Edge. As much of a commercial selling point that is nowdays, these guys drink more beer(except for one guy in the band) than most high school football teams. The one good thing I can say about this album is that the music is tight. If you are interested in generic moshcore, the kind that you tuph guys eat up, then buy this album. After listening to this album I actually feel like I have gotten dumber, that is a large part of the reason I am writing this review, to help persuade you the customer save your brain cells and cash by not buying this cd."
1,hate it.,they sent me the wrong product. bad labeling. just bad everything. no wonder it was so cheap. don't waste your money here.
2,i got what i paid for,this item is cheap cheap cheap and when it showed up it was cheap cheap cheap. it was never represented as otherwise though and it arrived at my home quite quickly. extremely satisfied overall despite the little use i will get from it.
1,Not to sleep on....,It's not worth the money... Too long for a really full size mattress... hard to handle and not easy to use...
2,I think I've read this before.,"Guy falls in love with girl who is a snob, but drop dead gourgeous. Guy meets girl who is tougher around the edges, beautiful, but not in a typical way. Very repetitive.The interesting part of the book was the part that took place in the tropics. After that it was all mush. You can do better for this if you're looking for romance!"
4,Great product!,I ordered this because my 7yo recently had an issue with impacted ear wax. I was hoping it would help me monitor that situation and it works great! I also have a 2yo who is prone to ear infections. While I would never try to diagnose an ear infection on my own I can definitely see if he has redness using this otoscope. I highly recommend this! Great value.
5,Very helpful to medically untrained Mom,"I'm not medically trained in any way. But with three very young children, I often suspect ear infections or ear aches and wonder if it's worth the trip to the doctor's office. I got this so I could start to learn what an infected ear looks like to help me know whether we needed to go see the dr or not. I am very impressed with how easily this otoscope allows me to clearly see their eardrum. One peak and I can see a normal, healthy eardrum. And while we haven't experienced an infection since I bought this product, I have full confidence that I'd be able to see the difference after seeing a healthy one so many times.I didn't buy this to diagnose or self medicate in my home, but just to save us unnecessary trips to the doctor's office when my son is tugging on his ears and being fussy because of teething or a cold or something that doesn't need medical attention. For that purpose, I find this to be a great product at a great price."
1,"Great concept, simple to use, but poor execution","The item is beautifully simple and a great product in theory. But it illuminates just about a few millimeters too short to be of use. I tried it on DH and he tried it out on me, but we got similar results. You could see the inner ear canal clear as day and get more clarity on earwax than you would ever hope. But the eardrum itself looks like a slightly illuminate white thing just barely out of reach of the otoscope, no matter how far you stick it in (and quite honestly -- it's not comfortable nor recommended if you push it that far). I thought maybe it was because it was that our adult sized ear canals were just a bit too long and tried it out on my sleeping 2 year old. I had the same problem, but compounded by much more earwax in her ears.I really had high hopes for this product. :o("
4,product does the job,I have purchased this item before. It seems a little more cheaply made than a few years ago. Still does the job
5,Works perfect!,The product was a lifesaver for baby with frequent ear infections. Only trick is getting baby to hold still :)
5,good product for fab. price,The product works great and was as pictured and wouln't hesitate to purchase again if needed. The quality for such a low price was amazing.
4,Dr Mom Otoscope,"You really can't go wrong this otoscope. The price was great, it arrived quickly, and lived up to its description."
1,Look before you buy!,"My son earned this toy by winning a gold medal in his TKD tournament.. We hqad to have it overnighted due to his excitement!When it arrived we charged it and finaly got to take it outside to fly.....well, we took it outside. This is a joke! There is no way with our current laws of physics that this thing can fly. We added the weight stickers to balance teh man, as per the instructions..we charged it every few minutes, as per the instructions...but nothing ever happened except the spiderman would nose dive as soon as it was released....Oh...did I mention the tears from my son? Overall, I would say that this was the worst purchase that I have ever made in my life. We have hidden the spiderman in the attic so it will not bring up any bad memories with my son. Maybe one day he too can get it from the attic and disappoint his children.. Buyer .. beware!"
5,MODERN WEST SIDE STORY,"Great Movie! reminded me of Training Day. Realistic depictions of todays world, real life.Alison Lohman was believable as the young girl, and Jonathan Avildsen as ""Cole"", gives an eye opening performance.Johnny Green convincingly portrayed the conflict between the two worlds he lived in. I recommended it to several freinds."
4,Greatest hits?,"Some great songs...actually most of them are. But what gets me, is how this can be called ""The Greatest Hits"". First of all there are 4 brand new songs on it, so obviously they cannot be counted as 'greatest hits'. Also a lot of hits were left off of this album. Anyway, regardless of that fact, this album is still worth having for any Clint fan. 16 songs on this album make it a lot 'meatier' than a lot of country albums that seem to stick with the old vinyl number of 10. The booklet contains all the lyrics plus an informative 3 page essay about Clint."
2,"Some light shines trough, country music that just kick a little.","Clint Black greatest hits ? Not much to write home about, sorry to say. It`s realy a downfall his version of the Eagles master peace Desperado. Sometimes everything goes wrong here, especially his voice. But anyway let`s take a look at the bright side on this album. The best songs are Track 15 No Time to Kill, which have a certain sting to it when it comes tosinging capacity and country flavour. Track 14 Life gets away also is a good listen, an has hit poential. It sounds like belive it not like the The Cure crossover with country music.Track 11 Cadilack Jack Favor also have some charm.Track 8 We tell Ourselves swings a little bit too. Track 6 A better man has quality and ""swing along"". Track 2 Summers Commin kick a little , but the rest of the tracks don`t makeme feel ""country halleluja"", sorry to say. Clint Black is not up there with Alan Jackson and Garth Brooks."
1,The Greatest Stinks Collection!!!!,"This is a MAJOR let down to me. If these are his greatests then I'm going to stop buying his music. Seriously, if you like country music don't let this guy spoil it for you. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! Get Randy Travis instead."
2,Disappointing,It's disappointing an artist of this caliber is filling albums with cover tracks of Eagles songs.
5,original clint,"When Clint Black first started recording it appeared he was along the lines of George Strait. His songs were great and this collection has most of his original songs. Don't care for some of his newer stuff, but would recommend if you are looking for early CB recordings."
1,Sorry I expended the effort to carry it home from the library,"&#65279;Whoo dawgies! Perfect for anyone who's grown bored with TV and hasdecided to see what reading is all about. Enquirer-like catalogue of encounters between extraterrestrials and rock stars. Substantiating ""evidence"" on a par with predictions of second coming of christ."
1,Not worth the money,Terrible movie. So predictable. Even a monkey can figure out the ending in the first five minute's. Save your money for anything else!
2,Good Acting Terrible Script,We've seen posh grifters fooling eccentric rich hermits before. Ditto for detectives just a half step behind the pile of bodies. Every one of these actors is too good for this material. Is this the best they could get or were they all upside down on their Malibu mansion mortgages?
4,Columbus Circle,"Loved the movie, very well done. Suspenseful with some nice twists in the plot. Worth watching and I recommend it."
4,micro really knows what hes doin,this is a really good cd if your into funky trance breaks not all the tracks appeal to me but the last half of the cd is too good its definitely worth the couple of bucks micro is one fantastic dj he really knows whats up
3,Good but not great,"If you're familiar with that Caffeine sound, this about captures it. With high-energy 4-on-the-floors pumping all over the place, Micro breaks it up a bit with uptempo breakbeats tracks. The word ""rave"" comes to mind very quickly. Micro's mixing is solid (from a technical standpoint) on this disc, and his track selection and arrangement are adept as well. The biggest problem with this disc is that it gets tiresome fairly quickly. You're good on it for a little while but before too long you're left waiting for something else. However, just when I thought I wouldn't pick it up again, I got a craving for it. For its genre (that high-energy clubby/ravey sound) it's very good. Personally, I can only take it a bit at a time. Every once in a while though, it's absolutely necessary."
2,Cheap Case,"I got what I paid for, very basic. Unfortunately, Coolmax will not respond to my requests to get a new USB door for the front, the original arrived stripped at the hinge point. I also had to reroute the wires for these USB ports as they prevented the door from opening."
4,"good unique indie-erotic movie, some scenes seemed too short","I don't like spoilers, so I will simply say that a full-nudityMolly Parker erotic scene, and possibly a brief full-nudityscene with the boyfriend character, are in this version andnot in the edited version.I think that the Molly erotic scene is important, soI recommend this uncut version of the movie.The picture size and quality are somewhat less that that ofthe edited version, but they are good enough.I thought a few key scenes were too short, but other than thatthis is a great movie."
3,Interesting,"Really an interesting overview of the philosophy of criminal law, but it does have some significant limitations. From a logical standpoint, there are many assumptions - both stated and implicit - that may not be valid or are at least debatable. Also, as a non-lawyer, I frequently found myself having to re-read passages that might be very clear to those who have studied law or related subjects more thoroughly. If you're interested in philosophy and epistemics and how they relate to criminal law, however, this is a good place to start."
2,Utterly forgetable,"Why does Harrison Ford continue to make such awful movies? Its reallt sad and pathetic. Does he really need the money or can he just not judge the quality of scripts anymore? His last decent movie was 1994's Clear and Present Danger. And why does Hollywood continue to greenlight such garbage? This story has been told a thousand times before-and better too. Ford plays a bank network security chief. His family is held hostage and he is forced to steal millions of dollars. There is no intrigue, no plot twists. One-by-one, the aging Ford kills off the bad guys and claims sweet revenge. Not only is it unbelievable, it is completely boring. This was on a hybrid disc so the HD DVD portion was crammed onto 1 side and the picture quality is not great. This one is not even worth renting."
2,Harrison can do better than this!,"Harrison Ford is my favorite actor. He's done this type of movie a thousand times before, and done it way better than this! I was struggling to stay awake the first hour. The action only picked up within the final half hour. I had to keep fast-forwarding, I was that bored. The story line was so far-fetched it grated on my nerves. A bunch of loser criminals (led by Paul Bettany---he can do better than this too!) try to computer-hack-rob a bank of millions by kidnapping Harrison's family, coercing him into helping break through the firewall he invented. When the thugs send Harrison Ford to work hooked up with a microphone and mini-cam to monitor him, I kept thinking there MUST be a way he could sneakily write a note on paper to notify the authorities. Huge snooze 95% through."
3,Harrison having a bad hair day,Some Spoilers here.A really great cast and plot. Also a pleasure to see Mr. Ford back in his action genre. But the scripting of this film is severely lacking. After 2 hours of intense action you wind up with a final scene that's been depicted many times in other productions but here is just ridiculous. Talk about loose ends. You have major actors like Robert Patrick and Alan Arkin cast and left wondering why they were here in the first place. They just disappear. Even Robert Forster is wasted in more ways then one. And the camera work is horrific combined with poor editing.And now for Harrisons hair. You've got to be kidding. Messy hair makes him look like the cookie monster. Probably the most detracting element in the whole film.For Harrison Ford fans see it and then anticipate the fond return of Indiana.
3,How the Mighty have Fallen,"Harrison Ford is either getting senile in his old age or is extremly bored and will join any movie that asks him. Harrison Ford is a great actor, in Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Air Force One and so many other movies he was great. Hes not bad in Firewall either but the difference is that the aforementioned movies were good. Firewall takes from so many movies and has been done before it becomes boring. They use every bit of heroism in Ford to make this movie passable. If your a huge fan of Ford rent it, because you won't want to buy it."
2,FIREWALL-warm---2.5 star,"FIREWALL is your typical standard thriller--the kind of movie HARRISON FORD does between blockbusters. CEO of bank and who created the system, in come the bad guys and take his family hostage, hero does what they want, hero wants control takes things into his hands, fights, stunts, some baddies die, hero takes down the baddies. very formula but entertaining. the movie is not boring just not original. note: HARRISON performed all of stunts in this movie(probably to get his body in shape for INDIANA JONES 4)!!!---now, that is worth getting HEATED UP for."
2,"The right elements are there, but so are the wrong ones, like plot holes...","Powerful actors, a tense situation, surprise circumstances....seems like this should have been a killer, and maybe it was for some. For me, it just seemed like the family (and Harrison Ford) let too many opportunities to escape go right by. That, along with the (admittedly dated) security system, made it difficult to watch the movie progress. Maybe it was good when it came out?...."
5,Harrison Ford produces stellar performance...... once again!,"I appreciated the twists and turns of the yarn and applauded the ""good guy"" winning out after many harrowing close calls.... as Harrison Ford's characters are known to survive. The baddy sort of looks like he has all the bases covered, but the protagonist, after pulling some of his own wizardry against the nasties, saves his family with the help of his little dog and the woman employee.Thank goodness for something that shows ""GOOD"" winning out against ""EVIL""."
4,This was a suspenseful and entertaining movie.,"I read some of the reviews of this movie last week and almost didn't rent it. But I'm glad I did. This was a good entertaining and suspenseful movie. I think some people just have wild expectations. It doesn't really have a lot of computer Firewall related scenes. Most of it is him and his family dealing with the bad guys. And of course the main bad guy is cold killer. Obviously with most movies like this, it has to stretch some things and make Ford the hero. But it was a good movie."
2,Booooooooring,"I just got through watching this movie for the first time, and I have to ask, ""Why doesn't Harrison Ford stop acting now and be remembered as one of the Great's?""This movie is poorly written, poorly acted, and does not draw you in at all. Many lines are repeated. Many actors/actresses have a role that never develops beyond fear (and a weak fear at that). The baddies sit around and eat all the time. The leader of the gang keeps telling Harrison the same things. Even the ending leaves you flat.IMHO, if you want a good Harrison flick, check out Raiders of the Lost Ark. If you are dead set on seeing this one, rent it first. You'll be glad you didn't spend the extra $10 to buy it."
2,Blah,same ol same . Harry hasnt had a good movie in a long time and this one isthe same as all the other movies of this type .
1,Harrison Ford's Worst Film,"Do not get suckered into seeing this ludicrous techno-thriller. Poorly written and directed, ""Firewall"" is Bad Cinema from the word go. The ever-heroic Harrison Ford stumbles into self-parody with his grim overacting - he's simply too old for this nonsense. A decent cast (Virginia Madsen, Paul Bettany and Mary Lynn Rajskub) is left stranded by the overall hopelessness. ""Firewall"" represents the absolute nadir of Ford's career."
5,An Awesome Harrison Ford Movie With A Great Villian,"FIREWALL Was a great movie. The plot was basic, but Harrison's Performance and Paul Bettany's Villian were awesome characters. This movie is definatley worth seeing and is worth buying when it comes out on DVD."
3,"Typical Ford Thriller - Enteraining, but shallow","Firewall is one of those movies that capitalizes well on common fears in the media, and manipulates those fears to an extreme with an outlandish plot...Firewall begins with a montage through the titles of how Ford's character is having his life and identity stollen. These scenes are probably the most intriguing and the ones that suck you into the movie. For the rest of the film, we are treated to the typical ""I am going to use you to rob a bank"" fair that has been seen in countless movies.Ford seems to be coasting in this movie as there's not much to act other than a few ""don't hurt my family lines"". The plot begins to unravel half way through the film and it just starts to get a bit silly and overdone.If you are looking for mindless fare to pass 2 hours, this is the films. It is more worth a rental than a purchase. Even though the plot is tired, performances by Bettany do spice up the acting a bit, and overall its not a pure waste of time."
1,Worthless on a laptop,I to watch my DVD's on my laptop and what I assume is some form of anti-copying protection causes the movie to halt and stutter so much that it is completely unviewable. I know it isn't the laptop because I can put one of my older DVD's in and view it with no probems whatsoever.
3,Firewall was average at best. The trailer was better.,"Don't base your expectations of Firewall on its trailer. Though the point of trailers is to provide a sample of the movie, Firewall was average at best. The movie was not as suspenseful nor as action-packed as the trailer suggests.Firewall just missed something. I guess that that was the fault of the director, who could have taken the same plot and made it more interesting. Kinda just blah.If you liked these movies, your NOT going to get it in Firewall: Die Hard 3, Executive Decision, Ransom or virtually every other Harrison Ford action movie."
2,How many times has this been done?,"How many times has this same movie been made? Seriously, there are so many movies exactly like this, and this one was also just cheesey and predictable. Some of the action was alright, but the whole thing was just so unrealistic and stupid that you didn't even care by the time it was over. I don't reccomend this movie, it's been done too much and this one in particular did not stand out."
4,A delightful surprise,"I wasn't expecting anything out of this movie, to be quite honest. I only picked it up because my parents wanted to see it and because I was bored, I went ahead and watched it. And I was very surprised. It actually turned out to be a good movie. It was very suspenseful. If you like hostage-type suspense movies, this one is for you."
2,"Ugh, ugh....and ugh!","I'm a fan of Harrison Ford but that wasn't enough to maintain my interest in this tired script. Also, Ford looks less than ""committed"" to the role, showing his own indifference or exhaustion. Yes, He's usually good as the hero type, bucking the odds, coming through in a pinch.But when an evil gang (headed by Paul Bettany) break into his home and threatens to kill his family if Jack doesn't tranfer money into an offshore account, Ford just doesn't have the ability to transcend the flawed plot and keep things suspenseful. He tries, acting incensed, desperate...etc...but he just doesn't have much to work with. The script needed more surprises and a LOT more tension.Catch it on cable - it'll be there soon enough."
3,A HO HUM THRILLER,"A ho hum thriller that feels very formulaic. Ford is the head of security for a bank that is about to be robbed by high tech robbers who are holding his family hostage. See Ford try to get out of this one. See Ford save his family. Like I said, it's a bit formulaic and as long as you don't mind it you should be fine watching it. This movie is a bit dates, too, when everyone was super concerned about identity theft ruining your life so the phase has somewhat passed. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; THRILLS & CHILLS: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: early May 2011."
3,Good Ford,"This is by no means Harrison Ford's very best effort, but it is a good action movie. It isn't ""Cellular"" or ""Don't Say a Word"", but it does have a good story, decent acting, and great action. All in all I found it well worth watching and ended up getting a used copy. Fans of action movies like ""The Net"" and ""Inside Job"" should enjoy it. I recommend you rent it and see for yourself.The storyline is about a man in the computer security business for a bank group. They are in the process of a merger when his family is taken hostage and he is pressured to give up information on how to access data so the money can be transferred to the kidnappers acount. The action moves at a good pace and a few twists and turns add to the drama. I recommend it, and I think it has good replayability."
3,Firewall,"I thought this was a good, but predictable movie. The traditional hold hostage the family while force "" The Man of the House"" to get you what you want without anyone knowing. Threats made along the way, but the family still comes out on top.Still a good movie."
2,Not bad...,"Not the best Harrison Ford movie, by far. However I still found it to be sort of interesting, albeit a little slow and predictable. But, I do love a happy ending. :) It didn't get me involved like ""The Fugitive,"" but it is Harrison Ford and I don't believe he can do a bad movie. (Oh, wait, I forgot about that Hollywood...movie, oops) Anyway, I don't know if I can recommend it with all my usual enthusiasm, but if you like Harrison, watch it. :)"
2,Disappointing,"I expect better from a movie starring Harrison Ford. He is forced to steal from the bank he works for because a high tech criminal has kidnapped his family. It doesn't go smoothly because recent changes has been made so Ford has to think quick on his feet. As expected, Ford saves his family due to a fortunate circumstance.I found the plot trite and there was only a couple of mildly exciting scenes. I suggest skipping this dud."
3,it was ok...,"...at first it was kinda boring, but then it got more interesting... it was just like any other thrill hostage movie...you'll know how it'll end :P"
3,"Pretty implausable, but....","I don't know....Lots of people reacting to circumstances in ways that I know I wouldn't react...Victims telling the kidnappers the way things are going to be done, kidnappers and victims buddying up, hostages basically going about their daily routines, etc... But, through all that, the movie was at least somehat entertaining. This was not a great movie, maybe not even good for that matter, but it was watchable and mildly diverting. Harrison Ford was probably miscast in this film. I did like the secretary however, played by Mary Lynn Rajskub of '24'. She did a good job in a supporting role. Don't buy the DVD. This is a rental at best."
3,Good movie...the story is just so damn OLD!,"Firewall is a good action movie, but if you have seen most newer action movies then you have seen this one too. The story is the same as all of them! ""Guy has a beautiful family. Guys family is held hostage for money/power. Guy saves family."" You know what Im talking about.This a good movie but will only entertain you the first time you watch it."
3,Unfulfilling,"Despite and good premise and cast FIREWALL is unfulfilling. Harrison Ford looks tired in this movie, very tired. The talents of Paul Bettany and Virginia Madsen (good to see her again) are wasted. The movie's grim look gives it a B-Movie look."
1,This film is photographed too too dark.,"I love Ford Harrison movies and this is not a bad story but the film is shot in such dark showdy lighthing by the cinematographer that it is unwatchable. It ruins the film and all the acting, directing and writing in it.Frank CavestaniDirectorOperation Last Patrol"
1,The worst Harrison Ford movie I have seen,"Stupid, non believable story with very poor acting. Harrison Ford must be very desparate for money taking on this role in a very poorly written screenplay."
4,"Great action movie, but could have done without the few curse words.",Another Harrison Ford great full of action and drama. I just wish they had left out the few curse words that were in the film.
3,So-so flick,"Harrison Ford looked a bit puffy and over the hill in this movie, but in the special features that accompany it on the DVD, he and the movie's director sat for an interview in which he looked about 10 years younger and fitter. Am I to assume that the interview was shot 10 years before the movie?Well, anyway, what preoccupied me from the outset of the story is that while Ford's assailants sent him to his office rigged with a video camera and an audio hookup intended to monitor his every action, it seemed that he could simply have written a note and slipped it to his secretary. Perhaps during or after his transferring the video camera to her pocket. Or at any of several times thereafter."
3,"Yeah, implausible","But entertaining enough to pass some time. Not as bad as some say, but Harrison where have you gone?"
2,Waste of time and a waste of $4 to rent!!!,The bad guys looked so fake and preppy that u couldn't even take them seriously. They could've atleast had actors with tattoos and a thug image other than a bunch white coller looking University students. Give me a break. If it wasn't for the cheesy looking and acting softee so-called criminals than maybe the film would've been suspencful.
3,"Interesting, yet predictable,,,","But what action film isn't these days. Can't the good guys die once in a while? Wow, Harrison Ford gets rid of all the bad guys with Cloes' help, woopeeeee!!!!"
3,2 Words: CROSSCUT SHREDDER,"I'm giving this movie three stars because I found it entertaining.However.One thing that really bothers me about the film is the setup. Harrison Ford's character, essentially an UBER-security agent for a humongous bank, shreds his OWN documents at home with what is evidently a $14.95 strip-shredder from K-mart. The perps had no problem picking his ""shredded"" personal documents out of the trash and pasting them together, because the 'shredded' strips are about 1/2"" wide.C'mon. A moderately-competent kindergartener could paste together such poorly shredded stuff.Hey... BUY A CROSSCUT SHREDDER! Oh. But wait. Then there would have been no movie!"
3,Kept me involved,"This movie wasn't a really exciting movie, like the cover makes it seem. In fact it was pretty boring. The movie is about a family taken hostage by some robbers who are trying to rob a bank. The robbers are trying to use a bank owner to complete this mission. Some parts of the movie didn't make sense and didn't seem realistic. Overall this movie kept my attention but was pretty boring."
1,"Flat, unsavoury techno-thriller","""Firewall"" is a hostage thriller with an IT bent. Sadly Harrison Ford is not convincing as an IT geek who can bust heads when he needs to and Paul Bettany is flat and uninteresting as the ruthless villian. Contains the usual off-hand brutality of this type of film and really, how much fun is it to watch a family being held hostage?""Firewall"" adds nothing to the techno-thriller genre and isn't Ford getting a bit too old to be playing these types of roles?"
4,Not the worst you will ever see,"Watching this was a solemn reminder we are all getting older . the familiar faces in this film, Ford, Madsen,Forster, Patrick, are all showing signs of aging gracefully. The flim is easy to follow, perhaps even to the point of being predictable at times, but that doesnt make it a bad film. Fans of 24 will be happy to see Mary Lynn Rajskub in a role that mirrors her role in 24, that of supporting the lead character (Ford) The film works well in setting up the plot and guiding us along to figure out how Jack is going to get out of this mess, which, as most films of this type present, he uses his keen mind to outwit the enemy. If you are looking for Indian Jones, or Hans Solo, dont watch it. But if Jack Ryan, a little older and just as wise, interests you, you wont be let down."
2,mediocre at best,"Its a mediocre film based on a mediocre idea turned into a mediocre script. Harrison Ford does not age gracefully, and the ending left me choking with laughter. If you live alone, have chickenpox, have seen every movie and read every book in the house, see this movie rather than die of boredom. Otherwise, don't, cuz there are better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life."
4,WESTERNS FOREVER,"Being a Western movie fan for as long as I can remember, I was excited to find this book about my three favourite actors (the only other being Gary Cooper).I found it a most interesting read and actually wished that it was longer. A lot of the movies detailed in the book I have seen however there were quite a few I have not seen but have now ordered through DVD and am looking forward to viewing them.I have always been a huge fan of Audie Murphy who I believe with the right scripts could have been a major player in Hollywood, and Randolph Scott of course is the quinessential cowboy.There is just enough personal information on the three men to keep it from just being a movie review book. I was moved by the foreword from Budd Boetticher (one of the great western directors) as you can fully believe it came from the heart.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves their westerns and has a soft spot for any of the 3 men in question."
3,Remembering westerns,"The western is a genre of film I grew up with and loved. My favourite was, and continues to be Audie Murphy. This book provides a great overview of three of the best movie western heroes. The men, like the heores they played, were honest and real. A great book for the film historian as well as for the fan."
2,Am I missing something?,"We bought this book because it was listed as a must read on some mom's website. Well, I feel totally taken. This book is lame. I wish I had checked it out of the library first and saved myself the money. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!"
4,A helpful updated reference of all things Jewish,"Not the sort of thing one would read in one sitting of course, but it is an improvement over its musty predecessor, and is a handy guide for most questions about Judaism and things related. Doesn't have any obvious political bent (except for pluralism) that I could discern, which is helpful in research, and so it is about as objective a reference on Judaism that could be found. Also gets with the program with information on women in Judaism, etc., that the older edition lacked. The kind of the thing one might give to a Bar Mitzvah instead of a pen, or get for a home library."
2,Not detailed enough,"If you are unfamiliar with either format, this is NOT the book for you. There is only the basic and does not go into in text citation and many other parts of APA & MLA. I have a pocket reference book and it has more information than this one does. Very upset with the book!"
5,Must Read,"A friend recommended this book to me, so I bought it and its on my list of best things I ever buy. It you are seek for a more connected relationship with God you should definitely buy this book and read it! Love it and my spirit as truly been bless through the word in this book...special thanks to my sister in Christ Shermika n Charles Swindoll for allow God to use him!"
1,Does not work on my microfiber couch,"This mitt is supposed to work using static electricity. When it comes to static, my couch wins. There was lots of static happening, but all of it was causing the hair to stick to the couch."
2,Underground metal!!!,"OK, so... this is just a good CD. Overall, yes, it can get kind of boring, every song is about the same thing, etc etc. But, hey I can't lie when I tell you that I loved it. The way every song is mixed differently, giving it that everchanging flow, keeping it from getting so boring like most metal CDs... I think the vocals could have been mixed a little better, but overall it wasn't bad."
4,Falls Apart,"I think it's the most favorite song that I like, and I wish to listen to it over and over again"
2,Nice functionality but sound quality and coverage is poor,"This unit was easy to connect to our two line phone and configure for compatibility with the phone.But, its sound quality was poor. People I was speaking with complained of lots of static during the call.Another problem with this product is that its performance is sensitive to the location of the headset with respect to the base unit. When I was 20 feet from the base unit, a motion of 4 or 5 inches meant the difference between a *VERY* static connection and a clear connection.Overall, we did not like this product and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Very hard to use,I love the game but this guide is extremely complicated and difficult to use. I don't reccomend it.
3,Nicely put together but not extremely useful,"The book has great glossy pages and the information for beginners and newbies to MMORPGs is good but once you get into the game the only thing it is useful for is finding out the levels of the mobs in a certain area and the difficulty of quests (which it doesn't have all of). The problem is that WoW is constantly being updated with new items, mobs, and quests so keeping a book like this up to date is almost impossible. They do have online updates but given that there are so many updates to the game it is tough to keep track of them all."
3,WoW strategy guide,"Good read when you are new to the game, but the built-in tutorial and easy quests can be enough to familiarize yourself with the game.You might pick up a couple of hints from this book, but I would say you can learn more about the game from actually playing and from other players online (mostly guildmembers, as general chat is filled with non-sense, jokes, people wanting attention, etc).You can leave this book in the bathroom and it helps pass the time when you are on the toilet."
3,Not bad,"This is a great book for telling you who is in what village and that besties there are in what area. But that is where it ends. It does give information on the races, classes, and professions, but it is nothing that you couldn't get for free on the many websites out there for WoW."
2,Not Very Good without Instance Maps!!!,"This guide is not bad, but there are several very major weaknesses:1) doesn't give a full list of all non-player characters (NPCs) by location2) maps are organized by region (Lorderaon, Azeroth, etc) rather than alphebetically, so it's difficult to look up zones3) no instance (dungeon) maps4) outdated after 4-5 patches that Blizzard has releasedNumber 3 is to me, the biggest oversight.The limited edition version appears to include the instance maps and might be more worthwhile...if you get get it shipped to you anytime soon!"
2,wow...more like boo,This book is dated!!! there no real usefull information that you dont learn your self just by playing to level 6 or reading the manuel. this book doesnt even have flight plans or a full maps. Just go to thottbot.com it has all the info youll be lookin for and more.
4,Essential reading!,"Most comprehensive and detailed description of the most popular game. Hints, advice, maps, characters and everything you need to know about them in a single book. Perfect illustrations and user-friendly design make this book the most pleasant reading for any gamer! You practically dive into the universe of warcraft with all its immense territories and deep caves, multiple races and creatures. The guide gives full account of complex interaction process between a player and the World. Most essential reading for everyone who wants to explore all the game can give!"
4,Very in-depth,"This guide was very helpful for maps and item lists, although it's biggest help to me personally was where to go for Mining, Skinning and Herbalism resources. I would recommend this for anyone who would rather have a book to page through while playing that having to Alt-Tab back and forth to a browser, but you still might find more up-to-date info online. I have not tried the updates to this book available either for free or purchase, but I don't see how they would be all that helpful except for the item lists.Do NOT buy this if you're looking for much help with character/class building/info. It's 95% resource/item lists. You'll find MUCH better info on building a character online."
3,Great Inight into Hitchcock,"Hitchcock's comments are fascinating and help explain how he made movies, captured suspense, and dealt with Hollywood. This is a must-read for any fan of his work and movies in general."
1,Oft-told tales offer caricature not a complete portrait,"I am giving Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock a single star because it has been revered as ""the"" book on this master director for way too long. I first read this book years ago as a new student of film and Hitchcock. Since that time I have read lots more about Hitchcock and with each new piece of the puzzle, have determined after re-reading it recently that there is little that is new or exclusive to this book. Hitchcock often told the same stories elsewhere, both before and after publication of this book some thirty plus years ago. The books sole value is as an entertainment, or as a Hitchcock-primer. This book merely provides what Hitchcock wanted to say of himself, the packaged image, just like his famous caricature. There are many other books to choose from which offer a more complete portrait. Seek them out ..."
5,Excellent it works,I have a wet land behind my house that runs along my property line. My house was cover with mosquitos due to the standing water during the whole summer long. I threw this things in the water and I was mosqito free fro the rest of the summer. I used it with this product as well Summit Chemical 30Oz Mosquito Bits 117-6. I just have to say that it feels great not having mosquitos around your house.
4,no more skeeters,"The mosquito dunk kills mosquitos effectively. In 100 degree weather, they last only about 1 week.As they dissolve and crumble, it stops up the sprinkler pump head. They also tend to float off the edge if they are not weighted down. Chlorine doesn't seem to stop them from working, but it seems like it should reduce effectiveness since it is a anti-biological agent."
1,no improvement,"well tried them and we have seen no improvement at all, maybe there are just to many or they are coming from other properties here but I am still being bit like crazy"
1,DOESN'T WORK ! WHAT A WASTE OF $,"We had high hopes for this product controlling the mosquitos around our home - the reviews seemed favorable - however! after using these dunks for a couple months now - can't tell a bit of difference in mosquito population! Also, no dead ones in water buckets placed around outside with rainwater in them - WASTE OF MONEY."
3,Not a whole lot of bang for the buck.,"I don't know how they work since it kills the larve and I can't exactly say whether the mosquito population has decreased or not in my backyard. I have 2 ponds on my property. Each dunk is good for 10 sq feet, so I would have to use 50-100 in each pond. At a dollar a dunk, I'm not spending that kind of $ and they only last 30 days. WEAR Gloves when taking them out of the packaging. BUT, I figured that since they are environmentally safe, we'd give it a try. I don't think I'll buy them again. Our frogs, turtles, and dragon flies probably do a better job at mosquito population control."
3,Depends on which pest you are trying to be rid of!,"I got this product because I heard it worked to rid gnats from houseplants. It does not work for gnats/fruitflies!!!! I will, however, try it for mosquitos and see!"
3,mosquito dunks,"this is definitely a good price. i don't know how they compare in effectiveness to the more expensive ones. in any case, i like having enough to plop in all the various containers that collect water."
5,awesome product,2nd time I have purchased these dunks. Great price for the quantity you receive. They work great and haven't been able to find them any cheaper than this!
5,Bye Bye Mosquitoes,"Excellent product and a great value since this is a bulk pack. Non-toxic to all other wildlife , pets, fish, and humans so I put one in a birdbath and one in a fountain. No more squiggly little larve so now there is a lot less mosquitoes in my back yard."
4,Good price,"This is about half the cost of my local store for an effective product and the delivery time was fine. These are not a panacea but they are effective in larger bodies of still water (ponds, wetlands, etc) Plus they do not have the negative effect that pesticides do (they don't work as well either)"
4,Works very well,"We have a small fountain, and the pump does not move the water enough to discourage mosquitoes from depositing their larvae. This product shut down the larvae within one day. The only negative is that when the product breaks down, it leaves crystals along the edge of the fountain, and some of them eventually submerge, which creates a build-up of the product in the base of the shallow fountain. But I'd rather have that then a mosquito breeding ground. I haven't noticed birds drinking from the fountain as frequently either. This can be good or bad depending on whether you like birds drinking (and relieving themselves) from/in the fountain."
4,Exterminate with extreme predjudice,"I killed a whole lot of fungus gnats with this stuff. Threw a chunk in the watercan every time I watered and it cleared out the whole population in a couple weeks. I left one alive and sent him on his way so he could tell the others not to mess with me and my mosquito dunks. No idea if these kill mosquitos, but I bet it's worth a shot. 4 stars, cause who needs this much of the stuff? Would've preferred a smaller package."
5,"Summit 111-5 Mosquito Dunks, 20-Pack","work great, super fast ship. killed all the mosquitos and larva in above ground pool in 24 hours. application last for 30 days."
1,Description and Title/Pic dont match,Id like to know if I actually ordered this what they hell would come in the mail. The Descriptions do NOT match the Title or the Picture in any way possible. Please fix this.
1,Review of something I never received!?,"Amazon just emailed me to ask for a review of this product. I have never received it after many weeks, and even after emailing the company to ask about its status. I can't vouch for the product, since I never received it, but I can CERTAINLY advise everyone to avoid this company for any purchases!"
5,solid release,"Solid beats and rhymes from these artist's. In German so can't understand the lyrics,but know that its on some non-gangsta, concious uplifting tip. Very tight productionand the emcees seem to be on point. Nice appearances from thirstin howl and PF cuttintoo!"
4,Warm up/motorcycle pants,"I bought these one size large for layering over my other pants and possibly long johns for riding my motorcycle to work in the cold early mornings before the sun. They work very well for this and I am good for at least another ten degrees. They do have some insulation, but principally the gap between them and my jeans as well as keeping the wind out seems to do the trick. I am not rating them overall because I haven't had them long, but I am well satisfied so far with the warming performance as well as the fit and the construction. There is one possible down side. The ankle closures look as though they should pull the elastic out of the cuff from both sides, they do not, so don't pull too hard on the side toward the zipper. The elastic actually only comes out on one side."
1,Technical problem is for real,"The price was better, the sound quality was as good, ear cushions more comfortable, and the detachable cord/monitor button good ideas. Then the whistling started. Started in the right ear, as reported by others. Vibration seems to be the problem. As long as I sit perfectly still everything is fine. However, now even walking makes it whistle. Covering the right earcup with your hand really makes it loud. I had the Bose ($$$) for five years without a problem (had to replace them only because I left them in a cab). Spend the money for the higher quality product."
5,Excellent all round,"NOTE! There was a reviewer that mentioned his cord woulnd't stay connected. I had the same problem, I'd have to hold the cord in to keep it playing out of both ears. I almost returned them when I accidentally found you have to push the cord in REALLY hard. The jack snaps in much more snug than you're used to. Problem solved!The sound quality is excellent (I'm an audiophile) and the noise cancellation is superb. I'm using them in my office right (data center) right now, and I can only barely hear my keyboard.Many people have mentioned the headphones don't crank out enough power, but I think that's crazy. I'm using my iPod at 1/4 volume right now and it's fine. I can't see any reason I'd ever have to go above half volume - particularly when you take into account the noise cancelling."
3,Bose is still the better one!,"Well, after much research I bought Sony. I travel in plane almost every week. Noise cancelling feature works well. But music sounds a bit lacking in depth. I compared it with Bose QC2 (from my co-wroker), music sounds much better with Bose, better depth. Weight wise Bose is a bit lighter too, makes a difference when wearing the headphone on long overseas flights.Bottom line is Bose is better, but if it is worth paying $299 + shipping I'm not so sure. I think for about $110 Sony MDR-NC50 is a better value for money. But if money is no object for you then go with Bose if you are looking to get a noise canceling headphone to take in the plane.One more thing, I noticed a screeching metalic noise after wearing the headphone for a while with noise reduction feture turned on. This is a bit annoying, but it usually go away after readjusting the connection between the headphone and the wire going to the sound source. I plan to take this up with Sony though."
1,Returning my 2nd pair - Noise & feedback,"I received my first set as a gift and experienced the low frequency noise in the left earphone others have described here. After a few minutes of use (in active mode) the feedback in the right earphone was unbearable. I was forced to turn these earphones off to use them. I can buy better headphones for this money without the NC technology. I returned the first pair in hopes this was a defect. My second set (brand new not refurbed) exihibit the same problems.The background noise seems to build (sounds like thousands of crickets on a hot night) until they break a threshold level and begin a high pitched squeal of audio feedback.I am in the process of returning the second pair and requesting a refund. Luckily, I have all of the paperwork.I'm very disappointed Sony let this product get into the market. I only gave one star because there wasn't a choice for zero stars."
3,Flawed headphones,"I bought these headphones because there were many good reviews on the internet, but i have experienced the same problems as some other users:The noise canceling function works for about 15 minutes, and then a loud screeching feedback noise starts to get louder and louder. The noise becomes so loud that it is unbearable and on every occasion I have used the headphones I have had to turn off the noise canceling function and continue to use them with the n/c off.Turning the n/c off and on again doesnt work, and repositioning the headphones (as the manual says to do) doesn't work either.Without the noise canceling function, the headphones are inferior to many much cheaper models, and the sound in these headphones is nowhere near top quality.So much for sony quality..."
4,Not too bad for the money,The Sony MDR-NC50 is my first noise canceling headphones purchase. I feel sound quality is good along with being very comfortable. I agree with other reviews on the audio sound level - needs a fair amount of power output to provide good sound. Very nice for airline travel. I would make the same purchase if I had to do it over. Decent price/value.
3,"Fantastic noise cancelling and fit, lacking sound quality for the price","If you're looking for comfortable headphones to cancel outside noise, these are fantastic.If you're looking for that plus excellent sound quality, these are lacking. Oddly enough, I found the Sony MDR-NC6 to have much better sound quality (not noise cancelling or fit though).Good- Fits well, even with guy sized ears.- Fantastic job of blocking outside noiseBad- My $30 Target headphones have the same sound quality. It's not horrible, but it's defititely lacking something compared to really good headphones. And for this price it's just silly. And to top it all off - Sony makes a pair that has great sound quality (the MDR-NC6). Why couldn't they copy those? *sigh*"
4,Great alternative to Bose QC2.,"These head phones sound incredible. The sound quality is like a speaker system, and they are a great companion with my iPod video. These cancel out a large percentage of noise, but not as well as the Bose headphones, of course they cost 3 times as much. With the noise cancelling feature on, i cant here a TV on at a regular volume in the same room. It is near immpossible to hear other peoples conversations, and they effectively drain out all car and plain noise. These come with adapters for a plane and stereophone, which come in handy, and also a case. My only complaint is that while wearing them for an extended period time, like a 2 hour car ride, they can become uncomfortable. Namely the top strap can hurt, and even give you a headache if it is in the wrong spot. The ear cups are perfectly comfortable. Overall I would reccomend these for someone who wants a cheaper version of the Bose QC2 set."
2,Not a Good Product,"It did not take long for me to decide on returning this set of headphones. They are totally lacking in output and quality. Bass is weak and muddled, mids are distorted and highs practically non-existent. Sony rarely seems to market bad products but, in this case, that's what they are.The noise cancelling is OK but sound is important, and these do not deliver. More generally, people should be sure they really want noise cancellation with their phones... it adds to the cost and subtracts from the quality. For only occassional use I advise sticking with traditional sets."
2,Not worth the money,"I recently purchased this set and used it on several trips (aircraft)They did not perform as expected, got a popping noise in the right speaker when listening to music and noise canceling at the same time. Decided to try a pair of Bose (more money of course) but wow, what a difference. This sony product was a waste of money."
2,Uncomfortable,I should have spend little more money and bought BOSE QC2 or QC3. These headphones crush my head and ears. Can not wear them more than 1 hour. Sound quality is good and noise reduction is also work fine. The on-off switch is not easy to operate.
1,Sony MDR-NC50,"I was very disappointed with this Sony product. I have owned other Sony products, including headphones. But these headphones really have problems.When activating the noise cancelling feature, I get a loud feedback buzzing in the left ear. Sometimes it happens in the right as well. The manual says if that happens that I have the headphones on incorrectly. But in order to stop the feedback I have to position the headphones half on and half off of my ears. Not very comfortable.I have other noise cancelling headphones and have never had this problem before. It only happens with this Sony model.I am really sorry that I bought these headphones."
4,It is a decent product if it is right for you.,"The phone is comfortable with an expensive feeling. So do not need to worry about the look.For the sound, where shall i start?1. without the noise cancelling function turning on, the music sounds flat. not good at all.2. with the noise cancelling function turned on, the music sounds better. (whyt?) the noise generated by the headphone does a pretty good job in cancelling most unwanted noise. this is good. however, it also adds 'hiss' that is discernible while you listen to the music. this is bad.3. in general, the loss of music details is significant, even when you turn the volume all the way up. in a quite room, i would use the sony headphone coming together with my CD player.my conclusion is that if you do not care too much about the music details, this is perfect for you. noise reduction is very nice and effective, but at the expense of sound quality.Does my review sounds like one of the past reviews?"
1,disappointing - 2 sets - 2 failures,"I saw the same problems as others. First set had rumbling in the right ear, and screeching in the right ear whenever I moved around (like walking). The defects seemed to get worse the longer I used them (about a week). I ordered a replacement set and they had extreme rumbling in the left ear right out of the package. Obviously a problem with this model. Stay away from them; save yourself the aggravation. I'll start looking for a different brand/ model now . . ."
1,Depends on What You Want,"If you are buying these headphones to be able to listen to music in crowded room, these are NOT the headphones for you. They work great at reducing background noise, but you can't hear the music very well. The sound is low and distorted. We returned these headphones the very next day."
3,Uncomfortable,"The Sony noise cancelling headphones work okay but they are very heavy and uncomfortable to wear, especially on long flights. There is a solid piece beneath the foam cover on each earpiece that presses into your ears. You have to constantly readjust how they sit on your head to minimize the discomfort. I have since purchased the Bose headphones, at a substantially higher price, but they can be worn for extended periods with no discomfort."
2,I bought $30 headphones that are much better,"I was really excited to use these. They are nearly as well reviewed as the Bose. Unfortunately, they don't work so well. They just collect dust on my shelf. The noise cancelling works well BUT if you are in an environment where the noise fluctuates, you'll notice that. For example, a window seat on an airplane. Which is pretty much what I bought them for. Not acceptable. Bass distortion makes them unlistenable. For a while I just assumed that's the way it goes. Then I tried my girlfriend's $30 in-ear fontopia headphones and I couldn't put them down. MUCH better. No bass distortion and I don't miss the noise cancelling AT ALL."
2,"Decent effort, but still lacking","I purchased these headphones because they were less than half the price of the Bose QuietComfort 2. Seemed to have decent specifications and reviews, so gave them a shot.The headphones are comfortable, with soft earcups, but they don't fit over the ear like the Bose, they rest on the ear. I found them to be comfortable, but just something to be aware of.The biggest drawback was that mine had a slight hum when they were plugged in and turned on, but not playing music. I assumed initially my set was defective, but upon exchanging them, the second pair exhibited the same noise. Even for a $20 pair of headphones, they shouldn't have any noise or interferance."
4,"Good noise canceling, good price","I bought a Coby noise canceling headphone but the arms broke in my first trip, so I decided to buy a better one this time. I didn't want to spend $300+ on something that I don't use that often, so I choosed these Sony ones.$120 is a good deal for these headphones. The noise canceling performance is excellent. The only thing is, as many reviewers mentioned, the left headphone gives out some funny noise if you don't put it at the right spot, and it is kind of annonying. But other than that, everything else is good."
3,How Much Noise Did I Expect To Get Canceled?,"I've never owned another product like this, so I had no idea what to expect. I did a spec comparison with the similar product from Bose and for half the price, decided to give the Sony a shot. It does reduce ambient noise, esp. in cars and planes, but of course it doesn't cancel out all of it. It works well enough to be worth a try, but if I want no noise and no music, I'll use earplugs. I'm keeping them."
1,Don't buy this product!!!!,"I bought these headphones to replace the earbuds for my iPod. The whistling sound in the right earphone grows louder and louder with use. I've notced changing to a new battery helps -- for a while, a short while, then the whistling is back. Pushing in on the outer ear cover really sets off the whistle. especially on the right side. As an engineer, I'd say it's a design problem. As a buyer, these are just another pair of earphones with noise cancelling off, so why not get a pair without that feature and save yourself some money?"
4,Just as good as the Competition...For $200 Less,"I was very surprised at how good these headphones sound. I'm an airline pilot that sits in the back about 40 hours a month. The NC50's stand up well to the new QC3's. (For about $200 less!)My only complaint is with the design of the battery cover. It is VERY easy to break the cover so use caution when changing the battery. I broke the cover within the first month of use and Sony replaced them within a week of sending them to the repair center. Also, they are a little uncomfortable if you have no hair on top :-("
3,"Sony Noise Cancelling headphones - good for the money, but not best","I did a side by side comaprison with Bose noise cancellation headphones,and the Bose was clearly better, and lighter.But the Bose was more than twice as expensive."
2,More ear-piercing feedback,"I bought these to reduce in-flight noise when I fly. I did a side-by-side comparison in a store with my wife's Bose headphones. I couldn't hear much of a difference. They sounded great in the store.They were useless on the plane.Like many others, I heard ear-piercing feedback when I turned the headphones on and tried to listen to the in-flight movie audio. I tried adjusting the fit and the volume. At best, there was still a faint bit of feedback. Even without the movie audio -- with just the noise cancellation on -- the headphones gave me a headache. I switched to my wife's Bose set for a while and had no trouble at all -- no headache and no feedback."
2,Cancels noise...but cancels quality!,"I debated hard about purchasing these phones after reading all the reviews. Now I have to decide about sending them back. The noise canceling works very well and I will try them on a plane. But the quality of audio is very poor. Bass distorts and treble cracks. At low volume, they're not bad....but I like to crank 'em up and these headphone just wont cut it. I will purchase another pair that are designed just for listening."
1,don't buy these!!!,"It says in the instruction manual, if not worn correctly, will cause howling. It sounds like feedback. You have to absolutely wear them perfectly. You can't move your head. You can't yawn. You can't walk. The howling hurts since it is such a high pitch. Plus, the audio is not really high compared to my other Sony headphones. With these headphones, I have to turn up my mp3 player at position 17, whereas other speakers play loudly at 12. The connection is usually loose as well, especially if you turn your head. I wasted my money at a Japanese airport in Tokyo, where I thought the quality would be great. Sometimes Sony makes flawed products. I will do my best to get a refund for the 19000 yen I spent (roughly 190.00). I thought it would be an equivalent to the Bose speakers for less. I was wrong."
5,very nice,"Great sound, great insulation of outside noise. The active noise cancellation itself isnt very impressive, but the insulation alone makes this irrelevant."
2,Noise Canceling does NOT work,"It was ""noise canceling"" feature triggered me to buy this headphone. But it does NOT work as I expected. I don't see much difference whether ""noise canceling"" is ON or OFF."
2,get the bose,"if you are deciding between this and the new bose, and youve listened to the bose, get the bose. these are cheaper, but not nearly as good on either noise canceling or on sound quality. the bose are worth it. these arent worth what you pay."
1,Cord wouldn't stay connected,I had to return mine. The cord wouldn't stay connected to the head set causing the left ear piece to go out. It got so bad the only way to hear out of the left ear was to hold the wire in place.The noise canceling works great though. I think I am going to try the Bose model.
2,Not worth even $80,"Pros: Comfortable in all the right spots, nice size cordCons: Doesn't cancel noise, bulky and heavyThese headphones do no such thing as noise-canceling. For my test, i had my sister talk at normal levels while i took turns turning the noise-canceling on and off in 30 second intervals and volume on my music at medium. First i would like to say, im a normal kid, not an audiophile. These headphones didnt mask a single sound, and believe me, for $200 I wanted them to work. I ended up returning them and getting some noise-ISOLATING v-modas, which REALLY do the job, and dont look huge and awkward (check them out, I reviewed them too)"
2,tiny sticks,"I was shocked to recieve 4 sticks instead of 4 nice potted plants. The michigan bulb website says it's ""normal"" for ALL their plants to look dead when they arrive. That is NOT normal at the Gurreney's website where I've had much success. Apparently I spent Over $20 bucks on four little sticks that won't look like the pictures for over 5 years. That's what the folks at michigan bulb told me. 5 years. Next spring they will have leaves, so at least they will be prettier, but I didn't buy them to raise sticks for a year :)"
1,Do Not Buy,"This was a total rip off. The plants come barely 4"" twigs with no leaves and diseased (the few leaves they did have were eaten through by drought, disease or bugs). The picture is VERY VERY misleading. Worse, I hve already left a review and apparantly it was taken down becuase they didn't want the customers to know the truth - this is no deal!"
3,Trees,"Came in a timely manner. Though what is shown on the website was not indicative of what actually arrives on your doorstep. I had thought it was a mistake. The initial shock wears off as you read the direction, but still it was a little worrisome."
4,Race to Some Great Fun!,"I have seen this film many times over the years and it is always enjoyable. The album is as fun as the film and brings a smile to my face when I hear the music of Professor Fate. I can see him with his Snydley Whiplash mustache yelling at his faithful servant, Max. Mr. Mancini did a wonderful job with this music! I'm sure it will bring a twinkle to your eye as well as your heart."
4,The soundtrack is as wacky as the Blake Edwards movie.,"I have the LP a very rare find. I am happy that it is finally in cd form. It is Mancini at his silly best. The only problem I have with this album is the Pie Fight Polka is not as long as the pie fight in the movie. That and the song The Lover Tree is just too sickening. Overall, it kicks. If you liked the movie you'll want this sountrack."
5,"3 Words I did NOT want to hear: ""Labtec Pulse Discontinued""","Labtec used to put out the best speakers in their price range, and even a step or 3 above with crisp treble, thumping bass they put any of the newer x.1's to shame (after comparing to my Labtec Pulse 424's I wanted to toss my new Altec Lansings in the trash). If you are lucky enough to see used Labtec Pulse speakers come up for sale, I can HIGHLY recommend them- especially any of the 2.1 models. BIG BANG for the buck here, people."
4,Great speakers for the price,"These are very impressive-looking speakers. They sound great, but I'm not a big bass fan, and the bass is sometimes a little too much for me. Other than that, they sound excellent. A perfect addition to any computer system."
2,Good sound but bad workmanship,"First, the speakers hurt my ears (they clamp to your head tightly) and another thing, after two weeks of using it, it stopped emiting sound. :-( However the sound quality is wonderful, full bass, etc."
2,"A great advertisement, but short on implementation.","I am a little bemused by the previous reviews. Being a practicing engineer, I had hoped for an more rigorous introduction to applying robust engineering principles, coupled to real life engineering examples. What I got was essentially a book length advertisement aimed at people who don't need or want to know how to do it, merely order someone else to apply the techniques. If you are a manager considering implementing robust engineering practices and design of experiments, by all means, read the book and convince yourself and your boss it is the way to go. If you actually want to use the techniques, buy a different book."
4,Meade 4000 Moon filter Review,"This is not too bad for moon observation.It reduces glare of moon as well, easy on your eye, especially for long continuous observation.It may be worth the item price."
3,Decent beginners book with a section on Draw,"Moorehead's book is a good first book with sound but somewhat conservative advice. It does not address any of the newer games like Hold'em or Omaha, but is one of the few books with a section of Draw."
4,A Good Starter Once You Get Past the Win2K MySql Install,"Can't go 3 1/2 stars and 3 isn't fair, so 4 it is.The author has done a pretty good job and uses an easy to understand colloquial style of communications that takes you through the nuts and bolts of an apache, mysql, and php install.She completely misses on Win2K though. I wish I'd read some of the MySQL install comments here before being forced to ""figure things out."" There is an errata section on the website that caught a few problems but Win2K and MySQL still isn't addressed and emails to the author were left unanswered.Solution for Win2K users.. go to the MySQL website and download the newest (non 30-day eval) version and .PDF documentation. The process of getting MySQL running as a service for WIn2K is addressed on page 100 or so.Then... go back to the book. The examples run well and are truly instructional."
3,Nothing You Can't Learn Online for Free,"In a nutshell, this book didn't teach me a thing I couldn't learn online for free. The stuff was _too_ simple, and none of it applicable for what I needed. If you're a complete beginner, buy it. If not, get something with more beef to the bones, and learn more usable PHP."
1,Authors page says it all.,"I started the book with just the greatest zeal.I was soon disappointed. I am a beginner and found that most of the information wasn't correct.Hey, that doesn't sound right! If this guy is a beginner how would he know if it wasn't correct or if he was just doing things incorrectly? Well this page is from the book and should explain it all:(...)The page is the errata from the book.I was pretty hard pressed to find a chapter that didn't have problems.As a beginner this tends to make the task of learning very difficult.IMHO"
2,not for the serious programmer,"This may be a good book to introduce readers to some of the basic concepts of programming, but I found too light weight and simplified to even consider it helpful when developing actual production quality code.Try the wrox book or php bible if you are considering a reference for real world applications."
1,Not a good book even for a beginner !!,"She just let you follow her codes line by line, again and again without explanation!! Plus, too many typo."
2,Not that good...,"Well, I got Cold Fusion and it was great - bunch of screenshots with code on them. So I figured out this one will be the same... Not. If you like 400 pages with 1.Type in bla-bla 2. Add $ in front of bla-bla Then buy this book. But in my opinion it sucks. Period. Good idea with CF but implemented awfull in case of PHP."
1,What is flash X?,"Letter to the author, Why is your upcoming book called flash X?!? Flash 5 (V) just came out, so I don't understand why so many books for Flash 10 (X) are coming out. Probably want to check this"
4,Excellent Starting Point for PHP Development,"The author has constructed example exercises beginning with the basics and moving on to form submission, error checking and database management. You will want to sit down in front of your computer and dig in! Examples support both the Windows and Linux OS. In the first chapter, you will use the CD-ROM included to set up your own Apache Web Server with PHP4 and MySQL! This make the entire process easy for anyone to use, right on your own machine. Some basic knowledge of open-source programming is helpful as details on errors that you encounter are pretty skinny. The book assumes that each example works and moves on. PHP does help you through this as each error will echo a parse error indicating the line that you need to fix. With a little patience and some basic knowledge of scripting such as Javascript or Perl, you will learn to use PHP4 in no time!"
3,Decent Read,"One thing this booked lacked was the ability to progress on practicle subjects. Most information was random and not very useful. However, the topics that described SQL seemed a bit stronger then the PhP text itself.-andy"
5,Fantastic Book for the beginner,"This book is great... Although I do have a slight programming background, as far as PHP goes, I was an absolute beginner. I got this book and within 1 hr. I had set up a database, a table, written a custom email script, a hit counter, and basically realized that PHP is not rocket science but rather an easy to configure language. Don't be afraid to try it! All of the code in the books is available at her website, although I recommend typing it in anyway to get a feel for the syntax..GREAT book!6 stars!"
4,Thorough examples; weak on set up,"PHP Fast and Easy Web Development is filled with examples which demonstrate how to use PHP effectively. With the information in this book I was able to use PHP and MySQL to set up a database for my website. This database will make my business competitive in my market.The only weakness in this book is the set up chapters. The book assumes everything works and moves on. Unfortunately, my system didn't work and after reviewing both the PHP aand MySQL sites I couldn't get it to work. I abandoned by PC, went to my MAC, coded the script, then uploaded it to my website (my host server has PHP and MySQL support). This made troubleshooting very cumbersome, but as I said, I was able to get the site up and running with little inconvience. This is an excellent reference for beginning PHP web development."
4,New Birth,Awesome CD and a run down memory lane - blast from the past- and I enjoyed it totally. Great listening.
5,Very nice rash guard,"Very good quality. Order at least 2 size up. Usually I wear xs, but I ordered Medium which fits me perfectly."
1,Sizing Extremely Wrong- TOO TIGHT,"These were really cute online while I was shopping for rash guard tops for my trip to Florida. I ordered 2 of these and when they arrived I could not even put them on. The neck opening would not fit over my head and after several tries of pulling and tugging I finally got it on. It was extremely too tight. I ususally wear a medium, but ordered a large because I didn't want a tight fit. I thought this shirt must be a childs size.I will be returning both of them"
3,Sizing extremely small; two sizes up not enough,"My wife normally wears a size small. Based on previous reviews, I ordered a size large for her and even that was too small and uncomfortable. I had to return it and order a different design in a size extra large. So ordering even two sizes up may not be enough."
3,just ok rash guard,"I purchased this for wearing over my bathing suit while swimming laps in a cool indoor pool. I am 5'4"" and 100 lbs based on other reviews I ordered a Med. should have gotten a small. It is a little loose for what I was looking for. I will save it for summer use at the beach. also I wish it had rubber along the bottom of shirt to keep it from riding up. I would not purchase again."
1,hazardous wastes treatment,"treatment technology , hazardous wastes ,solidification ,stabilitation,chemical fixation"
2,horrible Times Five,"I was excited when I finally tracked down this film on DVD. It's from what I feel is horror's late age-- the mid seventies to early eighties-- and has the location shooting and low budget grittiness that I love. But that's where my praise stops. This flick is SLOW! Not much happens until the last 15 minutes or so-- and I had long since lost interest in the annoying characters. Awful acting, horrible dialogue. No suspense. Don't expect much, but somewhat fun because it's so bad."
1,Bootleg alert,Take note that the Synergy release is a bootleg on DVD-R and taken from a VHS. The only legal release is the one coming from film materials released by Code Red DVD. I don't understand why Amazon can sell obvious illegal materials.
2,Hilarious movie,"A couple of criminals who happen to be kids and insane survive a deadly crash. They come upon a lodge own a greedy old man and his guests.This as others have stated is a ""so bad it's good"" type of movie. The deaths are rather unique although unconvincing. It's hilarious how these kids can get away with what they do and there lies the appeal in it.I'll give it credit, it's a rather different plot and movie than those other horror flicks. It does have the usual formula of other flicks. Many of the characters are unlikable and you don't feel too bad when they meet their end. Leif Garrett is pretty funny as one of the evil brats."
4,4 star 70's horror,"I feel compelled to write something positive about this DVD release and the company Code Red. Sorry, but the other two reviews on this page are very unkind to this stylish, well acted, accomplished cinematography and very creepy tale. Code Red deserve your support if you are a horror fan, and no I don't work for them, but they are a very small outfit struggling against the big companies. Devil Times Five along with Sole Survivor should be seen by anyone who calls themselves a horror film fan.So I say 3 stars for the movie and 4 stars for the DVD which has surprising amount of extras, and the box art is great too.Hope this readdresses the balance as this movie deserves more praise than the other reviews posted here."
5,happy w purchase,Great choice of music to use in my massage business. Very pretty music. Very relaxing. Customers have enjoyed it for their holiday massages.
4,Anime at its Finest,"This is the Definite Street Fighter and the best video game adaption of all time.The fight between Guile and Ryu is my favourite in the film.Guile puts in a far better performance than in Street Fighter:The Animated Movie although Ryu,Ken,and Chun Li are the main stars.4 things prevent me from giving this a 5 out of 5.Firstly the translation has been changed from the VHS versions and I think they are vastly inferior to the VHS.Secondly when M.Bison enters the scene the quality drops slightly in the 2nd half of this boxset.Thirdly the opening theme song and end credits are different here then in the VHS Version and once again its poorer.Finally If this is supposed to be a prequel to The Animated Movie.How Come Guile and Ryu don't know each other when they meet.I doubt Ryu would have 4got a battle like that.Generally though its excellent despite the minor niggles.They travel all over the world and most of the major characters appear except E.Honda,Blanka,DeeJay,and T.Hawk"
4,Chlorhexidine for my dog,"I bought this product after trying many other products for a seepy patch that just wouldn't heal that is located under my bull mastiffs neck. Day 2 after use it wasn't seeping any longer and the redness appeared to be subsiding. Although he still has the rough skin and a bare spot, most of the hair has grown back. It takes diligence and commitment to use this every day. You get quite a bit that I know will last forever for my dog."
4,eggcrate foam,Very satisfied with the product. There is a significant difference sleeping on the bed. I would definitely purchase again in the future when needed. The product arrived on time. Im satisfied with the seller.
2,Not a Reliable Computer.,"We had to send this computer back to HP 4 times. 3 times within the first year (under warranty) and once after warranty. We were charged $300. We also have an HP dv2000 series laptop. It overheated and died 18 months after purchase, only a few months after warranty ran out. How convenient for HP. I refuse to give them anymore of my money. Stay away."
