4,Keena70 says: Loving It With All My Heart!!!!,"This game is so awesome! It starts off in Sora, Riku, and Kairi's home island.After a brief fight with the Heartless, Sora finds himself in another world with his new weapon.He begins his quest for his friends and meets up with Donald and Goofy, and there's where the adventure really starts. I'm basically obssessed with this game.The combination of the Final Fantasy series and Disney is pure genius. Cloud, Squall, Yuffie, Aerith and the other FF characters really show Square Enix's true talent in this game. Donald, Goofy, and other the Disney characters helped me regain my love for Disney. I loved the song on the commercial(which is in the game), and I thank the artist who made the song. I plan on beating Kingdom Hearts really soon and I'm planning on owning Kingdom Hearts 2. Expect another review from me for Kingdom Hearts 2, because these type of games deserve to be played over and over,and perfect games deserve perfect ratings!"
4,Great Game for Kids and Adults,"This game was fun for me and my 2 children ages 14 and 6. My 6 year-old is better at the cup battles than either my daughter or I. My son(6 year-old) gets bored w/games very easily, but not this one. He loves the boss levels. I like that the game isn't too babyish, but still not too mature for him(i.e. Final Fantasy which he played at a friend's house and liked, but I felt was too mature for him.). He keeps asking when Kingdom Hearts 2 is coming out. I highly recommend this game for kids and adults."
4,Awesome Game,"This game is awesome! Disney characters + Final Fantasey characters = Totally great game! You play as Sora, a fourteen year old boy. Your companions? Donald and Goofy of course! The reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is your weopen is a key and the plot isn't 5 star quality. I love the game though! It's awesome! Final Fantasy charecters? I can't tell you! (...)"
4,The best game in the world,Kingsom Hearts is the best game ive ever played. I love the graphics. I also like how it shows tons of Disney characters and their worlds. In Kingdom Hearts you actually get the feeling of being Sora with all of the vibration. I also like the Gummi Ship where you get all of the lasers and cannons. Kingdom Haerts is defenitly my favorite game for PS2.
5,I finally found it!,I have really every kingsom hearts game that exists and I finally found the first part of it <3 I really enjoyed playing it.
4,"Love the game, not the shipping","I love this game. I decided after years of not owning Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 that I would buy them. I usually just borrowed them from my sister but since we came into some money, I thought for Christmas this would be a reasonable gift.I did not give either game 5 stars because after ordering them, I received NO updates or confirmations. The page where I ordered said I would have it by December 18th but they did not arrive until the 21st. And when I would log onto amazon to see the progress, It said unknown and still does even though I have the game now!The game itself looks brand new and came with all the booklets and warning labels that new games come with, so overall I am happy with the product. I just wish that the company would have AT LEAST let me know that my order went through and that it was shipped."
5,Best of 2002,"This game brings RPG's to a new (possibly disturbing) level. Squaresoft inserts many of their characters (including Cloud, Squall, and Sepiroth), and Disney puts in nearly all of theirs in some way, from Jack Skellington to Winnie the Pooh to Dumbo. If you like Final Fantasy, or even if you don't, you'll love this game, especially just to see the Disney characters interact. You'll love it."
5,"Rated ""E"" for Everyone","This game is the most fun RPG I have ever played. The overall layout of the game is similar to that of Final Fantasy. Some people criticize the game because it has Disney characters and looks too kiddie. I am telling you, just rent the game and play it. The battle system in Kingdom Hears has been completely revamped and is now real time fighting instead of turn-based. The magic system can be hard to deal with at times until you get a good feel for it, but the summons take a while to access while in battle. Beware, there aren't any cinema scenes except in the opening and the ending sequences, but who needs them in Kingdom Hearts anyways? The graphics are the best and the transition from 2D to 3D with the Disney characters is almost flawless. I highly recommend this game for anyone, whether you are a hardcore RPG gamer or a rookie. I guarantee you will love it."
5,Disneyfied but fun - a first!,"I hate Disney and think it is evil, but this game was superb. Despite the Disney characters, the game is engaging and creative. As well, the graphics are excellent and the combat system more fun to me than the FF one. A good buy for any RPG fan."
1,Kingdom Hearts,"I am so disgusted that the makers of such an excellent series in Final Fantasy can make such a stupid game in Kingdom Hearts. How messed up is it to put Disney characters in it? Messed up! And, I will be even more annoyed if this takes the place of FFXI. Everyone who loves the FF series should write to SQUARESOFT and tell them they better continue making Final Fantasy."
1,cool a** game,"this game rule i borrowed the game for about 4 days and i clocked about 50 hours of play and still hadnt finishedthe characters are cool because there are lots of characters to speak too and even fight with or against because the evil disney characters are your enemies and the good disney characters are your allyslots of final fantasy characters make an appearaneceand even sephiroth makes an appearance and so does cloud, aeris, leon, tidus, wakka, and many more and the disney charaters arent losers because they fight very well and you also get to use magic from final fantasy ,the most important thing is that you are not trapped in battles like in final fantasy where the screen gos blurry and you cant move any where else except the battle but in kingdom hearts you carry on as normalthe graphics is top quality and at the beggining you recieve a final fantasy type video which is top quality and very coolmy advice is that you buy it or live in shame"
1,crappy game!,"it's not really action rpg...this is more of a platform game which is why i hate it! you have to do alot of stupid jumps that are not easy to do because the platforms are ridiculously far apart. don't buy this game! frustrating, not fun at all! worst game ever!"
5,The most special game on the planet earth,"This game is very special. The graphics are amazing. The actions they make are extremely reallistic. The game has money to be used, people to talk to, and a wonderful battle key sword. You enter a world of wonder and yet you may be so fearful as to not enter the game. When I started playing it at my friends house, I couldn't let go of the controller!"
4,Kingdom Fun!,"Well, this is how it goes, this is a mix of Final Fantasy and Disney.The only thing I can say is...........................WOW!!!!!!!!!This is AMAZING!!!!!!With all the real time battle systems, this is definentlty the best buy this year. This is a hot game with a lot of fustrating puzzles, but just hang on there.You're character, Sora, is a young boy who is on a small island with his friends, Riku, Wakka, Tidus, and other Final Fantasy Characters from various games that you may or may not have already met in previous games, well, thats all I can tell you for right now. Get the game and be astonished at its graphics and many other astounding attributes."
2,Forgettable mashup tripe,"My 14-year-old daughter played this game for two hours, shuddered, groaned, erased the file from her memory card, put the disk away in its box with the air of a night nurse cleaning up after an unfortunate accident, and washed her hands up to the elbow. It's sad to see Disney trying to inculcate good buying habits (buys Disney, get it?) in the very young, and comical to see a kid raise her eyebrow, frown, and grok the entire situation in a sudden furious flash. Sorry, but Disney's ""crown jewels"" can't compete with Final Fantasy XII (or even X). How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Valley of the Winds? And Square Enix should be ashamed of themselves for soiling their own brand."
4,killer graphics BUT.................,"THIS GAME TOTALY ROCK I HAVE TO ADMIT BUT IS FRUSTATING LIKEHELL OR EVEN WORSE IT IS LIKE PLAYING VICE CITY WITH A BAD OR BROKEN CONTROL, YOU JUMP WITH THE O BUTTON WHEN ALL THE OTHERGAMES LIKE CRASH,AND JAK 2,YOU DO IT WITH THE X BOTTON,THEN YOU ATTACK WITH X BOTTON SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT A HARDTIME I HAD TRIYNG TO GET USED TO THIS GAME AND I STILL HAVE,AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY I DID MOT GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSEYOU CAN'T CHANGE THE CONTROLS. EVERYTHING ELSE IT'S GREAT.THIS GAME IS SPECIALY FOR PEOPLE WITH BIG PATIANCE LIKE GUNS NROSES OR OUR MOTHERS."
2,Tedious and just plain wierd,"This ridiculous pastiche of two marketing juggernauts -- Disney and Final Fantasy -- is a perfect example of how Hollywood will ruin the video game industry. Is this what passes for creativity now? There was barely any attempt to combine the two in any sensible way. The dialog between self-important FF folk and the most idiotic of the Disney crew (i.e. Goofy) is like being on drugs -- really bad drugs. The battles are tedious. The gummi ship sequences are dull as dishwater. The camera angles are literally nauseating. Watching the auxilliary characters in your party jump around like drunken spiders would be unintentionally amusing, if they didn't get in your way when you are trying to kill the incessant stream of boring baddies. But the worst part is the music. It is so insipid (particularly the Traverse Town theme) it is enough to make you turn the game off -- or at least the sound. I played about half this game and got too bored to finish it."
2,"Square=good, disney=bad","Basically, everything square about this game is good. It has a good progression speed (almost too fast, actually), easy controls, it's non-repetitive, it has a good battle system...but other than that...AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! too much disney!!!!!no1 curses, no1 dies, everything has a mickey mouse symbol on it, the characters r too ...soft...and the voice actors? david gallagher! lance bass! mandy ... moore!!!!!!it's insane!!! and the plot... quite frankly it [is boring].Did I mention the summons? bambi! dumbo! ...since i'm supposed 2 rate this on its fun factor... well its a great game, but the disney always interferes w/it. the square part is 5 of 5, but disney gives it, like, -10. so i'll be nice and give it a 2....!did i mention the hilariously long, boring, unskippable cutscenes?"
3,Kingdom Hearts,"I read the reviews before I bought this game and my hopes were high but after playing it I was disappointedThe graphics are great but the gameplay and camera angles are frustrating. There is a lack of flow when playing this game.The controls are tedious and the goals are not clear. Having to ""talk"" to everything that gets a circle around it is boring."
3,it's just barely ok...,"...pretty package, lousy content. there is the usual square trademark melodrama, camera that acts like a kid hyped up on sugar, 70% of dialogue is text only, elevator music, [poor story line] and excitement of visiting same town over and over again. now the realtime battle system sure sounds good until you play 'em. no strategy of anysort is required since you cant see whats going on screen (camera goes round and round...). all you will be doing is pound the attack button until the slow mo-stop blurred snap shot of your last blow..."
5,Best game of in the World,"Ok, I may be a 10 yr old on my Mom's account, but this game rules!!!! My 13 yr old sister and I love it and played practicly everyday. The bosses are very difficult, but they do have weaknesses. Already beat the game? Well, did you get all the puppies? There is a bonus alternate ending with footage of the sequal. The hardest bosses are Seproth(FF?) and Ansem. The ulimate hardest is Ansem. I beat the game 5 times and still going at it.It has good graphics and battle system. This is probably the best choice Disney made."
5,I hate RPGs,"but man I love this game. This is one of the only RPGs I have ever liked. When I first heard about the game I thought it would be corny, but when I got it for my birthday and played it I realized it was awesome. The characters are pretty cool and even though most of them are Disney characters this game is more of an adult gme, some of the bosses scare the heck out of me so I wouldn't let little kids play but this is a great game."
4,BEST GAME EVER!!!!,"I love this game! It's fun and exciting. I was hooked when I played it. I recommend it for any person (even people who hate RPGs! this is an exception!) actually, I give it 6 out of 5 stars. I can't wait until the sequal!"
5,Great game,"I personally have not played this game, but I can tell you that my 13 yr old daughter just loves it. She sits and plays for hours and has not had one complaint."
5,Please please PLEASE play this game!,"Okay, I love this game! It's my favorite game of all time! Sqaure and Disney did great job of making a plot, so certain mysteries are unsolved at different times. It's totally cool! I love the way they designed the characters too! They have great costumes and awesome abilities! If this game sounds serious, it's really fun and cute and funny! (For the fans, it has Winnie the Pooh! He sounds sooooo adorable!) So please buy this game! It will make you happy!P.S. A sequel is rumored to come out in summer or fall of 2005"
4,A Good Disney RPG,"So I picked up a PS2 just to play the Kingdom hearts series. I am a 24yr old male and have never played Kingdom hearts before even though I've played RPGs all my life. All of the other reviews have hit the pros/cons right on the head. The scenary and characters make this game. The combat is extremely repetitive but it is not quite boring. You are jumping around swinging your keyblade most of the time. The bosses are relatively epic for a game made when this was. I think the game was geared more for a younger audience because of the Disney characters and the fact that the RPG elements are kind of light. I would pick up a guide unless you like being lost and not know where to go to progress the story. You have to like RPGs to like this game, or it may be a good way to introduce yourself to RPGs. I would definently pick this up. It is very charming and the Disney characters are very welcome."
5,So cute you can't help but love,This game is so good. The graphics are totaly out of this world. The games includes all of the Disney stories that I grew up with. This game is so cute you just can't help but love it. This is a total must have !!!!!!!
4,A Great Square/Disney Effort!,"This game has something for everyone! Square's Final Fantasy Characters and all of the Disney greats (good and bad). Some of the worlds could have been exploited a little more (i.e. Neverland and Halloween Town), but all in all, even if you are not a final fantasy fan (I am), you will LOVE this game. The Disney characters appeal to my 8 year old, and the ability to summon the some of the Disney characters is really a neat twist. You cannot rent this game and then have to give it back. BUY it! You will want to replay this one several times."
4,Meant To Be Played,"This game is easily one of the best ps2 games ever made. It is so much fun to play and you can talk about it for hours. It has great graphics and has a funny, good story to it. It is NOT A WASTE OF MONEY. THIS GAME TOTALLY ROCKS!"
5,A Disney/Squaresoft Masterpiece,"This game is truly one of the best games I have ever played. It has terrific graphics, a great blend of disney and squaresoft characters, and it's storyline is incredible! There are many different disney worlds to go to, and lots of stuff to do on each one. Another great thing about it is that it's not too short, it keeps you playing for quite a while with it's many bosses. This is definitely one of my best games."
4,Best ACTION-RPG 2 hit the shelves,"I bought this game thinkng it was going to be one of those slo-mo Final Fantasy cons, but it turned out ALOT better than I thought. It combines Disney, Final Fantasy, and a smooth line of characters to make great, super cool worlds full of action,suspense, and a touch of adventure. The characters voiceoversare great, graphics are wonderful, and the awesome music kinda gives the mood to the worlds. The only thing bad in this game is the replay value. When you play it a second time there is no suspense because you have already seen it all! Overall, 5 out of 5 :)"
4,The Best Game Ever,"I wanted this game so much. All of my friends had it but me. Then I got it for christmas last year. Kingdom Hearts is so addictive because of it's great graphics and storyline. I have clocked it twice and have the secret ending, and now I'm onto expert mode, which isn't really hard because i know all of the heartlesses moves"
5,kingdom hearts... the best game ever! :),this is the best game i playd on ps2graphics: 10/10gameplay: 10/10sound: 8/10over-all: there is not much but... BUY THIS GAME!!! DO NOT RENT!
5,Kingdom Hearts Review,"THIS GAME ROCKS! That's putting it mildly. I wanted to put 10 stars, but the maximun was five. The storyline is simply stunning. It strays from the usual Save-the-Princess story, and is the first game that strays from that and is good. The graphics are awesome; better than most gamers could imagine. The way Kairi's hair flutters around when she shakes her head... did you see anything like that in Zelda?!?!? The music is wonderful. I have downloaded the theme song 'Simple and Clean' and listen to it 24/7. Okay, let me get to the point: BUY THIS GAME!"
5,toatally awesome,"this gasme is really worth you money.....it is really addictave... Its my first ps2 game and after playing both supermario games on nentendo as well as both zelda games.. it is my fave of all time... the graphics are beautiful and it is worth your money just for thoes... it is also a good game for younger kids because even though the main character, Sora, is bombarded by many enemies, ..... they are very, well, in reality, there very cute! The contralls are kanda of annoying but they really work once you get aquainted (except in neverland and atlantica where you swim/fly, ill never get used to that...) there are so many different worlds and disney also incorporated the origional spaceship, shooting idea for traveling. There are so many different backgrounds/worlds and i live for the seen sequesnces intersperced throuought the game..... btw im 14 and i still love it!! defenately worth your money."
5,Wow!There is not enough words to describe this game!,"If you love Disney then you HAVE to have this game!Its not just for kids it is for all ages!The visuial graphics are stunning!Celebritie voices such as Sora-Haley Joel Osment,Yuffie-Christy Carlson Ramano,Aerith-Mandy Moore,and Sephiroth-Lance Bass!SO Join up with Sora, Donald Duck and Goofy, as you will save worlds and your everyones lifes in this action packed Disney and Squaresoft anime video game on your PS2!The first first 2 minutes woke me up with the amasing songs and such."
5,AMAZING!!,"If you games with a lot of action get this game if you like Rpg'S GET IT! If you like games get this game!!There is'nt a word that can describe how good this game is. I have beaten this game over and over and over and over and I still am not tired of it. I've spent a least 1,000+ hours on this game!!This game is worth every penny."
2,"Nice idea, but...","I really wanted to like this game. Really. I mean, how can you go wrong with Final Fantasy characters and Disney characters?They went wrong.The main thing that drove me up the wall and made me take my copy back to the store was gods-awful camera. Ya know, the one that constantly points in the opposite direction of the way you're facing? The one that stays up on the top level while you're down on the bottom level? The one that doesn't follow you around corners for hours at a time? Yeah, that camera. Battle system wasn't good, either."
4,sidewindergal,"Very cool game, especially challenging at certain parts for me. For example when your trying near the beginning to save the ship when the storm is approaching. If any one has some hints that would be great. All in all a very fun and deep game."
4,Awsome!!,"NOW THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!! I LOVE IT,DISNEY AND SQUARE DID A GREAT JOB ON THIS GAME!!!!!! But why does it get only 4 stars? Because there are two things bad about this game. 1:Only 10 FF characters?! No Zidane and Vivi from FF9? Not even Terra from FF6?! Darn it!2:It get's really hard at the end. But this is a great game! BUY IT!!! DON'T RENT IT!!!!!!"
4,"WELL, it looks like goofy got less silly!","um, to start, this game has a nice story line. cool music, levels, charachters, cut-scenes,(although roughly 100000000000000000000000000 of them!) and its kinda funny watching sweet (no, you may expect this stuff from DONALD) Goofy busting *****'s to peceis(forgive my spelling).the stars are to not spoil anything. the cut scenes get annoying to me you cant skip the boss cutscenes and i always diedgraphics, the ff charecters got cutesy, (look at soras face in the cutsecenesmust buy please dont read those bad reveiws."
5,Not so Disney,"I know that most people think that this is a little kids game because it is by Disney. Every time that I meet one of these people all that I can tell them is how stupid they have been. This game is more of a FF game than a Disney game by far. The game is mostly fighting complex mosters, fave FF characters, and going through maze versions of many differant Disney films. (these Disney mazes are difficult and not some silly kid thing)I love this game and you will too. Even if you aren't an RPG fan you will be unable to leave the awe-inspiring Disney world of FF as you scrutinize every wall to see if there is a secret passage."
5,You have to beat masters,The part when you have to beat a lot of masters. And you have to travel everywere you go in the game but it's really good so thats why i rated this game the best. oh ya i for got that if you think the game is easy believe me im tellin it's not. After you beat masters every time than you will get to beat all the disney characters.
5,Keeps you entertained,"It has been several years since i have purchased this game, I have been playing this game since 2000, and i am still completly entertained. Replay value is very high. The real time battle sytem of the game will keep you both awake and alert throughout the ENTIRE game. I give the graphics a 4 out of 5, and the cinnematics are splendid. Story line is very deep and will just suck you in. After a couple of hours, you will feel very connected to your character. i can safely say that anyone who purchases this game should be more than stisfied. The only complain i do have is there are not enough CG, and that people who will use special attacks might accidentaly use the wrong one."
4,KINGDOM HEARTS is THE greatest RPG ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This has got to be the greatest game I have ever seen. It's got good graphics, awesome music and videos, and hear this battle with over 20 different DISNEY CHARACTERS!!! I know it sounds odd (I had my own suspicions too, but hey! Look at all of these game reviews all around me! We all thought Squaresoft(R) had lost it.Oh, there is also plenty of Final Fantasy characters also. {av. star ratings 4 1/2}) This game should be played if you can read a couple of lines(usually age of 6 is the appropriate age range for it is very difficult at some points. No bad language, no blood, no intercourses with the opposite sex, and no drugs and alchohol. Just the right type of game for little ones (this game is rated E for Everyone. thanks Squaresoft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Fun and Easy Game,"This game was in very good shape when it arrived. No scratches, case was in good shape. The game itself is easy and fun, sometimes it is difficult to understand exactly what to do, but it works itself out."
3,Neverending Story Meets Disney and Final Fantasy,"I haven't gone too deep into the story yet, but it's sort of like the movies Never Ending Story meets the Disney and Final Fantasy universes. A dark force is gobbling up worlds and you are given the task of stopping it. I think it's geared more towards the younger crowd in its graphics and mechanics. Each area is like walking through a ride at Disneyland. They are actually fairly small areas, but it is tough to figure out without a walk through where you are supposed to go or what you are supposed to do.The controls can be aggravating, particularly when trying to jump. It seems like your jumps are limited and fall short of where you are trying to get to. If you like the idea of playing Disney Characters in an adventure game, this is for you, however, I think are better role-playing games out there though."
4,Good but childish,This game has a good plot and good characters. But it's so childish that a 4 year old would be able to understand what was happening. The way the characters act is foolish and the way they speak make them sound pathetic. Also at the begginng of the game during the storm it was so dark I could'nt tell where I was going at all. So I had to turn my tv's brightness all the way up to be able to find Riku. Other than that the game is pretty good. I would buy it if you can handle the childness.
5,Excellence,I beat the main quest in about 30 hours but with a system as deep as Final Fantasy X's I still haven't found everything in the game and a game this challaging is the kinda thing that attracts people. It has an excellent story line and with the lovable disney characters make the game all the more fun. Add a deep ship construction system and you have an excellent game. I have to reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun game with no real offending parts. I doubt anyone can be offended by any part of this game. Truly a masterpiece
5,Awsome Game,"When I first heard about this game I thought Squaresoft had lost their mind.I mean Squaresoft making a disney game.Wow was I ever wrong This game is AWSOME.The gameplay is great,as well as the story.The only complaint I have is the camera angles at some points in the game.Especially during battles it can get real annoying.The rest of the game makes up for it though.Definitly BUY this one."
4,The coolest game ever,I think you would love this game Sora is a super kid. Squall has a gun blade you have to defeat him.I really think anyone that likes Disney you would love this game. Hope you buy it thanks for reading my reaport.
3,Kingdom Hearts review,"I have the game. I don't really play it that much because of the hardness. This is not easy because it is a Disney game. The cutscreens aren't great too. Though I love the begining!!!! The theme song is by the famous jpop singer, Hikaru Utaha. (^-^;;; can't spell names well)____________If you like this get_________Final Fantasy X-2, ect.Harvest Moon"
5,I WISH THERE WAS A KINGDOM HEARTS2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"MY FOUR CHILDREN AND MY HUSBAND AND I COULD NOT EVEN GET ENOUGH OF THIS GAME. NOT ONLY DID WE BAN TOGETHER TO DEFEAT CERTAIN BOARDS, BUT WE ALSO COMLPETED THE GAME TOGETHER. WE LOVED THIS GAME SO MUCH THAT WE ARE HOPING THAT A PART 2 IS COMING OUT. THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING, THE CHARACTERS ARE CUTE, ESPECIALLY RIKU AND SORA. WHO KNEW THAT A 31 YEAR OLD MOTHER OF FOUR CHILDREN WOULD LOVE A VIDEO GAME SOOOOOOOO MUCH. WILL THERE BE A PART 2?"
5,Lunar Larry (the game god) Review Of Kingdom Hearts,"lUNAR sCORE: ""i know what I'm talkin 'bout trust me""(((WHATS UP)))Ok if you love disney ...bottom line.... Buy this game. Its really cool...it oozez disney magic combined with a sort of Grown up darkness. I'd say the controlls are pretty easy and the game is very addictive. You gotta to see what comes next. It feature EVERY disney character you could want ...PooBear to Ursla. Good for ages 11-100. Very Beautifull Graphics...CLASSIC.BUY IT!!!"
5,Kingdom Heaven,"ROCKS, AWESOME, SWEET? no words to describe how friggin awesome this game is. i love this game to a point where if it were a person i would hav...nevermind. the game is so *INSERT WORD HERE* that you could lock yourself up in your room and play for hours without getting bored. a total of about 12-13 worlds will ensure hours of sleepless gameplay (i myself have played for 3 days i think altogether). The story is awesome and will leave you questioning. this game will not make you smart but it will not make your mind war polluted like almost every other game. so in short buy this game. !)"
4,good but get strong weapon last,the game is fun but when you get to the whale you cant find the keyhole. but i hate the fact that you dont get the ultimate weapon till the end of the game witch really sux.
4,Awsome Final Fantasy Tribute,"Wow, a really good tribute to Final Fantasy. And Disney too. Really fun, an alright story line, but its still kind of the same as most medevil games. 'Save the Princess!' Except in this one its 'Save a whole bunch of princesses'. But overall its a cool game."
4,Truly a Magical Game,"Welcome to the magical world of square. This game is incredible, talk about fun I haven't had this much fun playing a video game since like forever. Its truly amazing GET IT!!!!!"
4,Great Game!,"I was suprised how good this game was. All you usually hear about it is ""Oh, the fighting is so great"" or ""It's really hard"".But fighting is only half of the game. This PS2 game has great graphics and an awsome story plot. Even though this game is fun,some younger children might get impatient. There are some really long movies in this that you have to watch.(That's why I only rate this game a four.) Overall this is a good game!"
4,Kingdom Hearts,"Wow! I've just finished it - excellent role-playing game! It is a collaboration between Squaresoft and Disney, so features a lot of Final Fantasy and Disney characters, most with authentic voices. There are a few new characters, with voices from the likes of Haley Joel Osmond.The graphics are amazing throughout, although being closer to a platform game than classic Final Fantasies means that although the fighting is not turn based, the camera angles will have you tearing lumps out of your sofa in frustration sometimes.Each world that you visit is based around a different Disney movie (using the featured music also), although swimming in 'Little Mermaid Land' (Atlantica) is very frustrating.As a whole, the game follows a lot of Final Fantasy traditions, with plenty of side quests and chances to level up for hidden boss fights if you want.I highly recommend it, especially for Final Fantasy fans or those who were put off the series by the turn-based battle system."
4,"Not a new character in sight, but some new ideas","I must admit, I'm only partway through the game, but it has me steadily hooked.I've heard the complaints that the FF characters are underused or poorly used (so what? did the box really look like an FF game?), that this is a crass, commercialized game (this is partly a Disney product. Disney is a business. Business make money) and that the game system stinks (is the lack of turn-based combat really that big of a turn-off) but I really don't mind any of these things.The game's characters aren't original, but the idea of letting someone loose in an established Disney world has been brought forth quite nicely. Aside from some maddeningly difficiult leaps and some poor camera angles, the game runs smoothly and presents a different look for each world.This is a fun game, ideal for wasting away an afternoon."
4,Good But to much Story,This game has good graphics and good worlds the only thing that i dont like about it is that there is just to much story were you can fast foward. When you die while beating a master you have to wait a few minutes before you can battle him again. Those few minutes are the story repeating its self again. I wish you can fast foward them so you can get more playing time instead of story time. But i like the graphics and quests i just hate how there is so much story in it!
4,The best game ever,This game is truly a work of art it is so great it will keep you hooked on it and once you beat it you gonna wanna play it again overall this is truly the best game ever. P.S the best keyblade is the ultima you get it wehen you synthisize all 25 items
5,best disney and FF game ever,"If I could I would rate it 100,000,000 stars! over 100 disney charicters including:donald,goofy,and more.And there are Final Fantisy charicters too!You can go to other worlds like: wonderland,neverland,and more. you have to fight bosses like:Jafar,Malificent,and more! you play a boy named Sora.I havent beat the game yet, but it is a game for the entirefamily"
4,Amazing Squaresoft teams up with the crappy Disney,"Kingdom Hearts is a square game at heart, but features many disney worlds and characters. Even though there are Final Fantasy Cameos, I would have liked to have seen more final fantasy. We should have been able to go back to famous FF locations such as midgar, rather then just going into disney worlds. Nevertheless the game is still a solid title and should not be missed by anyone who likes an RPG with a good dose of action."
3,Not bad but spare us the video!,"A decent offering but you are forced to watch what feels like endless video to move the game forward. You wouldn't want to play this over and over again because of this. They would have been better suited to allow a fast-forward feature. We just want to play! Save us the long, drawn out videos."
4,an amazing game,"This game has pretty much everything needed to become a magnificant game. The graphics are astounding, the storyline is very original, the chracters are kooewl (obviously), and the controls are easy to pick up. About two days after i bought PS2 i decided to purchase this game as well, and i had no trouble mastering the controls.Although the disney chracters may turn some people off, they are accully a bonus to it. The fact that you are trying to rid the universe of darkness, and defeat evil disney chracters such as hades, Jafar, and Maleifancant is funney, yet oddley intense at the same time. However, the game isn't all about the disney chracters. as you get farther into the game you see less and less of them, and more and more of the heartless.This game is exelent, and i HIGHLY recommened it to any one who enjoys gaming."
4,Great Game but Not So great for Expert RPG'ers..,Sqare made another great game and it's DISNEY!!Kingdom hearts is more like a Disney stlye Final Fantasy 7.I would recommend to RPG beginners...
5,BEST GAME EVER!,"This game is by far the best game ever. Kingdom heart is the only reason I would ever buy a PS2. Even thought I have yet to beat it, my mere anticipation is enough to keep my will strong enough to beat it and keep on beating it Forever until my heart's contient. I would recomend this game to ANYONE! If you call your self a ""Video Junkie,"" and you have yet to play Kingdom Hearts, you don't have the right to even sit infront of a telivison and play any other game. Play Kingdom Hearts and your perspective of life it's self will be dramatically changed. What is really out there that we have no knowledge of. Not to the extent of ""Heartless,"" but I belive we're not the only one's in this univerese and Kingdom Hearts has broden my out look. I hope after you play thid game you'll be rejuvinated. It's not even if you're going to play it, it's when? I promis you won't regret it! :)"
1,Most Infuriating Game Ever,"If you hate it when games constantly make you repeat steps should you die, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Kingdom Hearts makes you constantly repeat steps when you die. Including long intro videos. This game is more obnoxious than it is entertaining. The gameplay is very simplistic. Throughout the entire game all you have to do is keep the lock on and keep hitting X and that is how you kill everything no matter what. I deeply regret buying this game not to mention the wasted time I spent on this game. This game may be better for kids under 12 but I have to imagine it would get old even for them to constantly repeat parts of the game."
1,One Of The Worst Ideas Ever,"Possibly one of the worst video game ideas in history.I played at a friends house for 2 minutes and it was one of the worst things I have ever played in my life, and I have played plenty of bad video games before but this was just horrible you can't really even call it a game, that's giving it to much credit Making a cool game like Final Fantasy mix with a stupid thing like Disney baby shows does not work. They make more and more and soon they will be making worse and worse games. Why not mix Resident Evil with Dora the Explorer? Or maybe Metal Gear and Barney. Honestly who ever thought of these stupid games in the first place should be fired and NEVER EVER be able to work for a game company or give an idea at all, because it is obvious they don't have intelligent thoughts."
1,Stupid round in circles game,"At the beginning of this game it was fun, you run around collecting things and it follows a logical sequence without being rigid, i.e. you have an objective but you can also explore. After the first ""world"" though, this game falls apart as far as enjoy-ability. Each world is small and you go round and round in circles in the game, knowing sometimes very little of where you should go. This is not fun. I ended up quitting the game, not because it was too hard or too easy, but because it is irritating for no good reason. The graphics and even the idea of the game are nice, too bad they screwed up the playing of it."
2,this game gets damn annoying,"i was sure that a disney game would be entertaining, but it drags on slowly, especially the tarzan level. also,the music is extremely annoying and you can't turn it off. this game is also difficult and hard to control. if you are easily frustrated maybe this game isn't for you. this isn't a laid-back, enjoyable game like expected."
3,Not Getting the Interest,I just couldn't get into this game. I found the controls touchy and the menus confusing. The story was odd and I couldn't seem to get into the characters. I know it is Disney with a twist and that many seem to love it and I tried but it was not compelling to me.
5,Reaches down to the child and brings it out,"When I first heard of this game, I thought it was a cheesy. But, I played it...and I played it again...and AGAIN! I fell in love iwht the game. I bought the soundtrack...The graphics are awesome...the storyline is crazy! The controls are easy...but the missions and puzzles are mind-bending. I can't wait until Kingdom Hearts 2 comes out. I hope Kidgom Hearts rolls out like the Final Fantasy...."
5,It just doesn't get any better than this...,"What could appear to be a kid's game on the surface has elements that captivate even the ""older kids."" The complexities of the characters and the ""Final Fantasy"" influence truly impact the soul of the game.Rather than go into all the plot points like other reviews, I can just say that this game can be played by all ages. The younger ones may not get the full value and impact of all the ""zen-speak"", and the older ones may laugh at some of the Disney comments, but overall it's a fun game that is truly satisfying and leaves you begging for more.I, for one, can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 2!Go Disney!!! Go SquareEnix!!"
2,Dosent match up to EA Sports NCAA Football 2003,"I bought this game after buying NCAA Football 2003, and after playing both you cannot compare 2k3 NCAA football to EA NCAA football 2003. Here is the main difference 2k3 has no dynasty mode, that just plain sucks, unlike EA which has a dynasty mode.Second when you try loading your seniors into NFL 2k3 it dosent load them sometimes unlike from NCAA into madden 2003. Oh yea did i mention that when you build your own school you dont have even have 1% the amount of opitions EA NCAA Football 2003 has for builing a school. Personally dont waste your money, its not worth it, better waste your money EA NCAA Football 2003."
1,Huge Fan But Disappointed,"I am perhaps one of Sandi's biggest fans. However, I was disappointed in this cd. It was billed as a return to the style that made Sandi a household name. Lush orchestrations with soaring vocals were promised. Greg Nelson's name was used to show that this was a return to the times of Make His Praise Glorious and Morning Like This. In my opinion, this cd does not meet those standards. This cd reminds me more of Le Voyage or Another Time, Another Place."
5,Holds a unique place in the development of jazz fusion!,"This music is now about 20 years old and it's unique place in the development of fusion and jazz is more clear than ever.It's a trio with Rypdal on guitar, Vitous on double bass and Jack DeJohnette's amazing drums. But it's a good step outside the guitar trio tradition. It's a Strat, not a Gibson. These guys are coming out of electric Miles and Weather Report, not Jim Hall and Bill Evans.""Maya"" alone is worth the price. Vitou's ""Mountain in the Clouds"" has the same feel, haunting, intelligent, but with the kind of energy and drive you get when the drummer steps out of the box.Consider this if you like Rypdal or want a place to start or if you love DeJohnett's drumming."
4,Excellent historical!,"We read this book for our mystery book group and everyone loved it. I especially liked the dialog -- very realistic -- and the 1920s setting. We were lucky enough to meet with the author and she filled us in on Obee and Sarah (both quite real and quite impressive) and how she built the mystery based on Obee's scrapbooks.This is a must-read for people interested in the time period, Toledo (used to be an important city), mental health treatment, etc. Very well researched, structured and paced."
2,Hoping For The Magic of The First Album; Got The Mediocrity Of The Second,"Outside of 'Curious' sung by Tina Cousins, this album is a dud -- at least by 'Believe' standards. Most songs sound similar with the same beat. The album won't make your ears bleed, but the band should have quit calling itself '4 Strings' after the departure of Vanessa. It is a very different band now, and should not tease 'Believe' fans into thinking another 4 Strings album of simliar quality and vocals is being released. I would buy 'Curious' if it can be purchased separately, but would skip buying this album. If a future reviewer knows where Vanessa ended up, please let me know. The mixers of the group are talented, but Vanessa was the real star."
1,dissapointing,"Unlike the first album, this album was poor. The female lead vocal was nowhere to be found on this album. I couldn't even stomach listening to this album once!"
2,Not as good as previous efforts!,"The song sunrise shows glimpses of earlier brilliance, a couple of other ok tracks but far short of their other 2 albums. Bring back Vanessa! UPDATE: I'M GETTING A BIT USED TO IT NOW SO MAYBE 3 STARS...."
1,bag pictured is not one described!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I ordered this bag at the amazing price of $59! I then looked a little closer at the picture and noticed that it didn't look exactly like the description. I figured out that they are selling last year's bag (that doesn't even have the triple triangle strap) under the description of this year's model. There are several big changes in the newer bag which make this sweet deal really sour!!! I found a review on the identical deal except the bag was the blue one... There was one review from a guy that didn't figure it out until he got it in the mail! Fortunately I was able to cancel my order before it shipped out.Personally I think Amazon should have to send me the one that I was being told I was buying at that discounted price... Oh well I just wanted to warn anyone else!LOOK AT THE PICTURE BEFORE BUYING!!!
2,Way tooooo easy,"I was excited about getting this game, since I was looking for a good 2D fighting title for my GBA. It has good graphics and ok sound, but as the previous reviewer states, it's a short game. I was going to take this game for a long trip, but I found it so easy I finished it in about a week, unlocking all the secret characters. It has a very poor plot compared to what the KOF series has all of us fans used to. I really don't recommend you buying it, but maybe renting it or borrowing from a friend. Also, another bad characteristic is the fact that you cannot erase the previous data, so if you buy it used, it'll probably have all the characters unlocked."
3,Five minutes of fun,"I paid only 400 pennies for this game. And quite right too as it certainly does not have much lasting appeal. In fact I finished it twice the very day I started playing it and was about to go for a third today but it just wasn't worth it as all the levels (8 of them) were the same and there was no variety other than the different types of attack between the 18 characters. The backgrounds are blandly drawn and the knockouts unspectacular.All the usual KOF characters are here, such as Terry, Andy, Joe, Mai and, my fave, Geese Howard but I'm afraid this game is rather tedious and far too easy.Graphics BSound BGameplay B-Lasting Appeal C"
1,Don't waste. Your time,Horrible movie. Do not rent or buy. Save your money. Is not scary at all. It's dumb and waste of money
1,Had Enough Of Found Footage Movie,Well i tried to watch this movie with an open mind but after watching it i decided to close my mind back up.A horrible waste of time.If you have some time to kill watch this movie but your be better off just going to sleep.HORRIBLE!
1,Bad Bad Bad,I truly thought this movie was going to be good but it wasnt it was truly a freaking disappointment. For one leave these haunted houses alone leave the dead alone and in the end what happened they all died I REALLY HATED THIS MOVIE.
1,Awful!,Wow. This movie was awful! It was boring and the characters annoyed me. Who goes into an abandoned house? What is wrong with you? I mean seriously. It had terrible acting. I want the hour and a half of my life back.
3,Confusing,"This movie was originally called 1666. Somewhere along the line, Lionsgate acquired the film and decided to name it Knock Knock 2, even though it has absolutely nothing to do with the first Knock Knock. Even more puzzling is the fact that the original Knock Knock didn't even sell well so if they thought adding a fake sequel to the franchise would help - they were wrong.As for the movie itself, nothing to special. Your average found footage haunted house flick. The first half drags quite a bit but the 2nd half is a little more interesting. Paranormal Activity fans will probably enjoy it."
5,wierd movie for a sequeol,i was expecting to be part of the first knock knock and to my suprise it does not and i love the movie
2,Silly Movie,"Wasn't too impressed with this one. It was very, very slow starting and never really improved. Not much in the scare department either. All in all, not a very good movie."
1,No one's answering this rancid joke,"Nice try, Lionsgate, but I question the 'genius' move of renaming this movie Knock Knock 2 for a myriad of reasons. It obviously has nothing at all to do with the first one, it's in a completely different sub-genre (the first was a slasher while this is a found footage film) Plus I strongly doubt anyone of the 15 people who had the supreme misfortune of seeing the first Knock Knock would ever want second helpings of that cinematic cesspool anyway.But I digress, this movie regardless of the title is utterly awful. Imagine ""Paranormal Activity"" made with a lot less money, few fewer scares (knock knock 2 has none whatsoever), worse actors, and a woefully unengaging storyline. Now this film is 5 times worse than whatever you've just thought of. A complete mess beginning to end."
5,Education at it's Best!,This is a wonderful way for you and your pre-schoolers to bond together in their beginning learning processes. very effective in your childs development.
4,Wisdom in a samll package,"The Spanish Gardener begins and continues on for most of the book as a simplistic story about a self-involved man who needs to control everything within his reach, including his son. Near the end, two big surprises make one reconsider the jist of the story. Loved the highfaluting language."
3,A old beginners book to Karate.,"This is a simple beginners book to karate for young kids. It's best for a introduction to Karate. It is a good book to start with, if you can find it."
4,Future 22XX... Neo Arcadia will rule... Not unless for Zero!,"I love this game so much! For all of you who like Mega Man X games get this as soon as possible! If you've played all the Mega Man X games, this story will change every thing in the series... Get the game and see it yourself today!"
5,BBBBOOOONNNNGGGG!!!!!!!,"well i walk into the store hearing about a game that you play only as zero throught. i check and sure enough there it is ""Megaman Zero"" so i purchase it and return to my dorm to play. and to my great suprise it was a wonderful game. just hearing the old X music when Zero was revived gave me chills. i love how you level up your main weapons and also have little elves helping you throught the game. a different way to take it than the standard defeat one boss to kill the next but still a good buy."
5,"Zero takes not only the cake,but all of the world bakeshops!","This time,Zero is hip AND powerful!His weapons rule!He dosent take the cake,this time,Zero takes more bakeries than u could ever IMAGINE!!!All in a nutshell,ZERO RULES,AND HE'S BACK WITH A VENGANCE!A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO EVEN KNOWS ABOUT MEGAMAN(X)! U WOULD WANNA KICK YERSELF IF YA PASSED UP THIS GAME!YOU HAVE GOTTA CHECK IT OUT! ..."
5,One of the best Mega Man games yet!,"This game is the best! Use the new Cyber-Elf system to create the strongest character. Unfourtunatly the game is pretty short and you do not recieve special powers for defeating bosses. But you can get different types of elements which allow you to take on bosses with great ease. There are also weapons which allow you to attack in 8 different directions, keeping the destruction level to max. I strongly recomend this game to anyone who is a mega man fan or who just got into the game. But what if there is no paper or pen to copy the password... wait there is no password instead a new save feature is included to keep the game flowing smooth. And once you conquer the final boss you can play again with the same Cyber-Elfs! See if you can find them all!!"
4,Almost Classic,"This 1986 release marked the beginning of my listening to AOR and really developing an attention span. I remember the Summer of '86 spending endless days locked in the house, grounded and hanging out with my brother Wilson listening to ""Love Walks In"" over and over and over while he played air drums and I stood waiting to mime Eddie's incredible solo on this and the sludgy breakdown on ""Summer Nights""! This album and my brother got me through a truly horrible and confusing time in my life. While Eddie's guitar now sounds a bit thin and compressed to me and the electronic drum pads haven't aged well, this is still a great collection of tunes by a band that was obviously in transition. Sammy Hagar's raspy vocals are a nice fit for the band and overall this is still quite enjoyable, a bit too polished to actually call ""hard rock"" but a good catalog item."
5,Welcome the redrocker,Back in 1986 I did not know what to think when I heard David Lee Roth was out and Sammy Hagar was in. This album showed a new grown style of hard rock music. The song writing was miles ahead of anything at the time. Eddie came of sounding refreshed and ready to jamm. A must have for any Van Halen fan!!
4,Enter the Hagar,"I never liked David Lee Roth. I never liked his vocals. I never liked his overinflated ego. I never liked his cheesy antics (hey, Roth fans, have you seen the ""Jump"" video??). No, Sammy Hagar was a better lead singer in every way. BUT there is no denying that Van Halen's songwriting and arrangements were better during DLR's stint. While Van Hagar had some good songs, most of the lyrics sucked, and many of the tunes had no sense of what they were trying to be (pop, rock, melodic, atonal?).That said, I think the good songs on 5150 are generally VERY good. ""Dreams"" works as solid pop rock. The title track is possibly my favorite VH tune. ""Summer Nights"" and ""Best of Both Worlds"" are classics. Even ""Why Can't This Be Love"" works in its own way. So that leaves half an album of crap. But the other half easily makes up for it."
3,Sammy Hagar,"This is a pretty mellow offering by Van Halen with Sammy Hagar on Vocals. I wouldn't recommend it unless to fill your collection. Key tracks are: Why Can't This Be Love, Best of Both Worlds & Dreams. This was the first Van Halen album with Hagar on vocals."
2,"come on, you hate Sammy, don't you?","The downfall of Van Halen. No matter what Van Halen tell you. This cd is not Van Halen. Van Halen exists only with DLR. Buying this cd is like going to Dairy Queen ordering a chocolate ice-cream cone, and getting vanilla instead."
5,One of the best with Sammy,Brings back a lot of good memories... the songs from this album have energy and the sound is timeless.
4,Van Halen in a new style,"Shortly before Spring 1986,Van Halen released their seventh album,5150,with a new lead singer Sammy Hagar. Sammy already had a career by himself and with HSAS,which is an acronym for the last names of the band's members,another being Neal Schon of Journey. That same year,original Van Halen lead singer David Lee Roth released his second solo album,EAT 'EM AND SMILE. Sammy's biggest solo hit was I CAN'T DRIVE 55 in 1984. In '86,this was one of the year's best-sellers. Hits include WHY CAN'T THIS BE LOVE,DREAMS,GOOD ENOUGH and LOVE WALKS IN. The studio that this album was recorded is called 5150. On INSIDE,we hear the band ""bulls---ting"". One said ""What kind of crap is this?"" Another said,""You got a point there!"" Their follow-up,OU812,was also a big best-seller."
4,Hands-down Van Halen's best album.,"5150 is easily Van Halen's best album. ""Dreams,"" ""Love Walks In,"" and ""Why Can't This Be Love"" are three of the best songs that VH has ever come up with. Like most of other VH's best songs, they are synth-rock combos with very poignant, memorable hooks. ""Summer Nights"" and ""5150"" are decent but not great; the remaining songs are very forgettable and talentless.5150, the debut of Sammy Hagar, is Van Halen at its apex of its creativity. In the David Lee Roth era Van Halen's rock was harder but most the material is very simple. In the Hagar era, VH became more pop-rock oriented, creative, and complex but the vast majority of their songs -as with the Roth era- really don't cut it. Most Van Halen albums are vastly overrated and have only 1 or 2 songs at the most that are good.If you want a compilation of Van Halen's best, ""The Best of Van Halen, Vol. 1"" is a very good compilation."
3,The best after Roth left,"Of course, the real Van Halen features David Lee Roth on vocals, and Sammy Hagar can never take his place. While Roth has a rough voice full of attitude, Hagar is more of a high pitch squeaker. But ""5150"" is without doubt the best post Roth album from Van Halen. ""Why can't this be love"" is the outstanding track on this rather solid release. ""5150"" is not only for dedicated Van Halen fans. If you like melodic hard rock I guess this one will satisfy your needs quite well."
2,Boring and different,"5150 was the first album with Sammy Hagar. When he joined, their music changed comletely. Eddie's guitar playing dosen't even sound like a guitar. Their is not one good guitar solo on this record. All the solo's are a bunch of whammy-bar noise crap. Anyway, the cd does show some good tunes like Dreams, and Love walks in. That is about the only songs I can think of. The album proves that VAN HALEN WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER ALBUM AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST. It seems that their songs are not as good, and neither is the guitar playing."
3,WHAT HAPPEND TO THE ROCK N' ROLL EDDIE?! :-(,"an alright album but i think that when they got hagar they started doin' all these lovey dove' songs. its not that is bad i mean the lovey dove songs are good fer that style of song, but man whats with all the keyboard. theres only like 2,3 songs with awsome riffs (amazing riff/solo in best of both worlds. but like man i thought i bought a hard rock cd but its more lovie. but dont get me wrong; it is still a great album but i just think VH could have done alot better. n put alot more effort into writing hard bone crunchin' rock n roll riffs. this would definatly not be the first VH cd i would buy( if i were u get there first album or 1984 to get into VH) but this album is worth buying. im just a little confused on how one of the biggest rock bands can go all synthesizer on me."
3,Too Pop,"This album is too pop for my tastes. Van Halen was a heavy metal band, but afterward, they turnes kind of synth pop. No offense to Hagar, but Diamond Dave was a much better singer. Also, some of these lyrics are dumb. For a VH newbie, I would reccomend 1984 or Van Halen II."
1,Van Hagar Yuck,"I really really really like Van Halen, but when David Lee Roth left that just did it for me. Even though Eddie still jams just as good as before I just don't like Hagar. For me Roth's voice made this band just that much better. Even though he thought he was bigger than the band his deparcher for me was the end of a great band. Van Halen was great, but Van Hagar is less then ok."
1,Sammy hagar is horrible,This was sammy hagar's first album with Van Halen after Diamond David Lee Roth was kicked out and let me tell you this CD is so bad I threw mine in the trash can as soon as I heard the first song. Eddie Van Halen's choice of throwing DLR out of Van Halen was the worst decision of his life.
2,Boring,"Don't get me wrong, I like Van Hagar (not as much as Roth though). This album just bores me to death. ""Why Can't This Be Love"" and ""Dreams"" are the only two songs that don't. ""Good Enough"" and ""5150"" are decent songs as well, but I think ""Summer Nights"" and especially ""Best of Both Worlds"" are boring as hell. Those two songs make me miss Diamond Dave. I'd highly reccommend any Roth VH CD (along with Eat Em and Smile) or any other Van Hagar CD over this one."
5,The best Van Halen CD with Sammy H. on lead vocals,"This CD is my personal favorite with some great tunes. Although this CD does not have the normal cutting guitar work from Eddie, it does have some enjoyable tunes and Sammy on lead makes them great."
4,VAN HALEN STILL ROCKS!!!,"Though many complain about HAGAR i actually like his vocals i mean he isnt dimond dave but he aint a bad singer i was hesitant to try any hagar stuff but i found this album in a bargain bin and i have to say it rocks this is some of eddies best work the first 6 songs kick A$$,GOOD ENOUGH is a great opener and WHY CANT THIS BE LOVE is one of my favorite hagar song GET UP is awsome sounds alot like early van halen DREAMS is another classic on this album SUMMER NIGHTS and BEST OF BOTH WORLDS have to be the crowning jewels on this album.LOVE WALKS IN is another good ballad and 5150 is a great track the only track that brings down the album is the last one INSIDE.but overall if you want to get into the HAGAR years of VAN HALEN buy this album."
3,The 2nd Age of Van Halen,"I admit that I am I big Roth fan, and I had second thoughts about buying this cd. I love the awesome guitar playing of eddie, and I loved dave's vocals, but I wasn't sure if the Red Rocker could keep up with one of the greatest bands in the world.When I got it and played it, it was ok, but nothing compared to the roth era. There are good songs like Good Enough, Get Up, and 5150, but tracks like dreams and Love Walks in were just plain cheesy with the keyboards and pop sound. Through the years,Van Halen basicly went from a Hard Rock band to a pop rock band. The only thing that I really enjoyed was Eddie's guitar plying, and even that was less entegetic thn normal. This album was ok, but you could do a lot better with a Roth Van Halen album, or even roth'solo albums."
4,Not quite the best Van Hagar but the most accessible.,"Van Hagar.. the term given to the Sammy Hagar era of Van Halen. Most people associate it with such pop jingles as Right Now and Can't Stop Lovin You. This album, however, captures the Van Hagar era at it's most wild and unrestrained. (Much like.. the Dave era.. considering he actually wrote a good deal of the material here).This album has it's weak spots, however. Hagar isn't Roth, and when he tries to imitate him (Get Up, Good Enough) he just doesn't sound right. But on the poppier songs (Why Can't This Be Love, Dreams, Love Walks In, and the excellent title track ) Hagar is solidly finding his footing with the band. Edward and the band sound excited and invigoriated throughout the recording, as well, even if the guitar is a lil heavy on the Whammy-bar.5150 is the Hagar album most Dave fans can get into. But OU812 was Van Hagar at their finest."
2,Forget the Dave vs. Sammy stuff; the songs just ain't good!,"Maybe I'm adding fuel to the fire, but I'm sorry. Over night,the VH motto changed from 'Ain't Talkin' Bout Love' to 'Why Can't This Be Love'. Also, enter syrupy love ballads(thankfully absent from the Roth years),and possibly the WORST lyrics I've ever heard.(""Only time will tell if we stand the test of time!?!"") And 'Get Up' only sounds like the band is trying to out-rock themselves. Given; Sammy is a good singer, and obviously did bring energy to the band, but they should have taken their label's advice and changed their name. But check out the video for this tour, 'Live W/O a Net' for a few laughs. Eddie's pink parachute pants pre-date MC Hammer by over 4 years!"
3,Stellar,Van Halen has always seems to be a different band after the departure of David Lee Roth. The first album with Sammy Hagar had a bunch of hits that made it to radio. I enjoy the Van Halen days with Roth a bit more but I do give a good recomendation for this album.
4,No more sammy bashing please!,"Development...thats what happenes with a band. This album was released with a new singer about 10 years after their first album. Diamond Dave may have been flashy...but he was also a pretty big tool...and please don't try to tell me that he is a better singer that Sammy!5150 is a great album...take it for what it is though. Don't try to compare it to anything from today. Musically well written...but still characteristic of the time. Eddie continues to lead the field in technically outstanding guitarists and still remain commercially successful.And after all of that, when you want to start bashing this album and criticise Sammy, remember that he was with VH for 10 years and 4 albums and this was when VH was at their most successful. This album is a classic and should be in any rock enthusiasts collection"
4,2nd best,"THIS IS THE SECOND BEST CD FOR VAN HALEN WITH SAMMY HAGAR,BALANCE BEING THE BEST.THIS HAS SOME REALLY GREAT SONG ON IT, WITH WHY CAN`T THIS BE LOVE,DREAMS,SUMMER NIGHTS,5150.THIS CD REALLY SURPRISED ME BECAUSE WITH DAVE GONE I WAS REDDY TO GIVE UP ON VAN HALEN,BUT THIS CD TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD.THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY VAN HALEN FAN."
4,Very Enjoyable Debut of Sammy Hagar,"Okay, I was skeptical of this. David Lee Roth had just left Van Halen, and the initial single, ""Why Can't This Be Love?"" was pretty bad. Then a friend bought this and I heard the entire LP. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Besides the single, the rest of the album is very enjoyable. Songs such as Good Enough, Get Up, and 5150 are great rockers. Dreams and Summer Nights are the type of songs that make great singles, without selling out. Over all, not a bad buy."
5,Attn Eddie,"I am an avid Musician. I just wanted to let You know that You were my insperation when learning to play guitar Years ago, & are still today. You know as well as I that Music is the very essance of inner peace. I have nothing but respect for Your knowledge in music. Also I know that music isn;t a talent but an earned credit. You top the list of my favorite insperations. Keep rocking on. Also I would like to add, I really wished ""Sammy"" hadent left the band. Van halen live~""Right here right now"" Was the all time bomb~! So this is just a note of thanks for inspiring me to go on with with my music through thick & thin. God bless.......Paul Tarlton, Decatur ALABAMA."
5,The best incarnation of Van Halen,"Like it or not Diamond Dave lovers, this is the best Van Halen line-up. Sammy brought a new energy to these guys on this album, and it is the best Van Halen album. I was a sophomore in high school when this album came out, and I remember that everyone had a copy of it (on cassette at that time of course!) The album went to number one on the charts and has some great songs on it...""Why Can't This Be Love"" and ""Summer Nights"" are great. So is ""Dreams."" Too bad their isn't any good rock music like this being made in the 90s...now all we have is that hip-hop rap crap and bubblegum pop."
2,Sierra Bookbag,The bookbag is way too small for a student bookbag. It is good for small kids but not for teenagers.
3,High Sierra Wheeled Backpack,This is a great backpack for my son. I will not tip over because of the legs in the front. He is enjoying it.
5,Multi purpose backpack,"I bought this backpack for my daughter to use as a carry-on for a trip to Europe. It's been on 4 international flights,train trips around Scotland, and a short car trip to Germany from Switzerland. It carried books, Swiss chocolate, cameras, and any other items necessary for a tweens travel plans. She came back and said ""I love it.""K.W."
2,Horrible game,"This game was horrible. The graphics are pretty good but the gameplay is horrible. I actually give this game 1.5 stars out of 5 so I had to round it up. I tried to play this game for as long as possible but it ends up being incredibly boring. If you want a good NCAA game, get NCAA College Football 2003, not 2K3. 2003 is the best sports game I have ever played, while 2K3 is one of the worst. Don't spend your money on this, get NCAA COllege Football 2003 for a realistic football game that keeps your attention for a very long time."
5,Best Players,I LOVE this game. The Best player on this game is #4(conerback) on Kanas State. This player is really TERENNCE NEWMAN! Conerback For the Dallas Cowboys Drafted in the 2003 draft.(5th pick overall by the cowboys
4,NCAA,"I just bought this game a few days ago. This game is pretty good when it comes to graphics and and other things you would look for in a Football game. I olny had a coupple probles with it: #1. The game Menu and it's inards is so Damn confusing and the manual does not explain it that well. #2 which is not really a big problem, It's just the controls take alot of getting use to. If your use to madden like I am. Prepare your self!....over all Im glad I bought it. You should to!"
4,Great book,"I really enjoy this author. This book is a bit different from her later books in that the main character isn't interacting with the past or within the past; however, the character is influenced by the history of the place she is visiting. I enjoyed the writing very much, was captured by the characters, and drawn into the story. The story held my attention until the end and I was not able to figure out the main twist ahead of it being revealed. Very good book. I would highly recommend."
3,Good escapism with somewhat predictable plot,"I liked this book. That said, I found the plot and character development a bit disappointing after reading Kearsley's other novels. The main love story wasn't well developed, at least compared to, say, The Shadowy Horses or Named of the Dragon. The plot really reminded me of a classic Mary Stewart novel. Kearsley is usually more original and unpredictable. The setting is beautiful, and the ties to the two historical Isabelles were quite nice. You can find copies of this book in English, by doing an out-of-print book search on the web. It also shows up on the Amazon auction site pretty regularly."
4,Outstanding writing and style overcome a stock plot.,"In this wonderfully written old novel, western tourists are held hostage by Soviet troops for political reasons in a train heading back to Finland. This sounds like the ""airliner captured by terrorist"" plot that has become so familiar to readers and moviegoers. Not so! The writing is just an absolute delight, with human characterization that is unexpectedly outstanding. The outcome is not the usual ""hidden hero among hostages overcomes the terrorists."" Read this book. For a cuppla bucks for an old, out-of-print paperback, you'll be pleased. I am ordering his other books through Amazon."
1,Nowheresville,"This was one of the worst books I ever read. I found the novel utterly depressing and vapid, where the characters never learn from their mistakes or progress in any fashion. All the other characters use Numie, the protagonist, and he lets them do so. If a nasty, bitchy ""Dynasty""/""Melrose Place"" sort of book is your thing, then this is for you. I am amazed I actually finished it."
1,DO NOT BUY,great at first...wait a year. IT WILL BREAK YOUR SCREEN bezel. My brother and I both used these cases and it broke both of our screens. The way it mounts puts excessive strain on the bottom corners as you open and close you mac and eventually the metal will fatigue and break. Its a major job to replace the screen bezel so its best to AVOID THIS CASE.
4,Does the work,"Hey guys, I just got my case and I have to admit that I'm impressed, I thought it was going to be cheaper but is pretty good..but I have some problems, I have a macbook pro 3,1, the one with silver keys, 2007,and the right side of the case does not fit with the holes, if you want to use one of the ports you need to take the case off. also my charger has some issues with the left side of the case, it adds some thickness and my charger can't be put in its port as it should be, but it doesn't bother me.Those are the only problems that I found with my case,it fits well to my macbook pro I'm happy with it.. not fascinated, but happy"
3,Wrong product for my MacBook Pro,"Good product, but it didn't fit my exact 2008 MacBook pro model. I wonder why this item isn't available as such."
4,Great cover,It fits just right. It protects the computer from scratches and falls. Wish they still had other color available though.
3,Speck Case,"The case is nice and arrived quickly, but the ports on one side of the computer don't match up to the cutouts in the case."
1,WHAT A JOKE!!!,Tim Welsh is a joke and his teams cannot play a lick of defense! This book should be listed in the comedy section!!!
2,An okay flashlight,"About average for the price, nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight. The wide beam is fairly faint, with a strong central spot. This one will go out into the garage, and likely stay there."
1,Disappointing,"When I bought Tymora's Luck I was terribly disappointed. The truth is, I had to look for something I DID like. Now, I love TSR books and wish the company well, but this book is terrible. The plot is laughable, the gods are infantile in behavior and hardly worth reading about let alone worshipping. Pass it up....."
4,An enjoyable read,"When I purchased this book I didn't realize that it was part of a series, so I will have to go back and read the other two. Still, I found the book interesting and entertaining. A previous review stated that the gods were infantile, but when compared to the antics of the Greek and Roman gods, it's no different. Also, since I have just finished the Shadowdale trilogy and started the Avatar trilogy, I was intrigued to get a little more understanding of the various planes and realms the gods inhabit and a hint of the vastness of the ""multiverse"". This book is written a lot different than the others I have read from the Forgotten Realms, adding to its charm (probably why I enjoyed ""The Night Parade"", too). If you're looking for something a little different, then this book might be for you."
4,One of Novak and Grubb's best!,"My only complaint would be the fact that the plot rests on Lathander being far stupider than is likely. Besides that, this is excellent stuff."
3,A bit bigger than what i expected,The glasses were a bit bigger than what i expected and a bit lighter !!
4,"...got an ""awesome"" from the grandson....","...bought this device as a birthday present for my grandson, age 9. While I have not yet used it, he has assured me that it rates as ""awesome"" in dispatching his opponents when playing WAR in the back yard. He particularly mentioned that the increased range gave him quite the advantage over his opponents. He has currently captured sole control of his back yard, and is now eyeing over expanding his territory to the end of the street....."
5,Neighborhood Fun,"This Nerf Gun is awesome. My son is 12 years old, and has now purchased 5 additional guns. They are great because all the kid in our area come over, and he to their homes, to have 'Nerf Wars'. They are safe for inside the home, they don't damage any of the furniture and watching the kids design different games and ideas is wonderful for creative minds. We like them so much, we are considering purchasing some for this coming Christmas, as gifts for the younger kids. My son and his friends, living on a farm in Kentucky, are always hunting, with real guns and bows, and fishing...the Nerf is 'No Worry and No Danger'!!"
3,huh,"this gun is good, until it breaks. my brother's broke and now the air leaks out of the gun. but my friend has a rocket also and his rocks! i wouldn't buy it"
4,Good,"It has good pictures of bones, upclose and clear pictures of muscles, organs, body cavitys, Digestive and respiratory system and the heart. It was a good book everything you ever wanted to know about the body of a cat and more."
1,Almost a great product but poor customer service,"This is a great innovation. I'm a teaching pro and this handy portable rebound net is just the answer...but...defective materialmade it very temporary. It takes a little patience to get used to the setup angle to provide good rebounds. However, used no more than 10 times, the stress on the fiberglass frame that is always under stress due to its bowed fiberglass construction eventually will break at the weak point which is right where the fiberglass frame is joined together by a metal coupling. When I finally contacted the manufacturer, they did determine it to be defective and promised a replacement. They went dark on me and never provided the exchange nor would return my calls. So as long as you are not looking for a long term tool, this is a cool item. With a bit of engineering to correct the flaw it could be a great mainstay."
1,Arrived broken and corroded,"For $38.00 this is not what I expected. It came in the box from Amazon wrapped in a little peice of bubble wrap. Needless to say it had fallen apart during transit, the precious salt spilled out all over the box and I could see that the central metal rod that the grinding mechanism turns on was already corroded. Also the grinding plates were made out of a plastic not sturdy enough to grind salt rocks. I wouldn't recommend this product. I was looking to kill two birds with one stone, buy the salt and get a salt grinder that was reusable. I didn't get either. On the other hand Amazon was very good about returning the item."
4,definantly dancable,"This re-make of ABBA's ""mama mia"" is very retro 70's and has a funky rythym perfect for dancing!"
5,"A Highly Recommended Title, as Entry Level Textbook","Excellent review of Hertzian and Non-Hertzian Contact problems. I highly recommend this book for those who are having their first contact with the subject. Grad students will find it useful and clear, but I'm not sure that undergrads will have an easy time handling the book, or the subject, for that matter."
5,Great cover,"Really surprised, this seat cover fits like a glove. and the pockets are an excellent idea, great for keeping your odds and ends in. Only things that were disturbing, was the lack of info in the tracking of the item, and even though the item arrived on the last shipping day stated, I still can't put together why it takes so long to ship."
4,Good Entertainment for a Yao Fan,"This book includes many interesting stories and facts that fans will definitely enjoy about the Chinese sports hero. It alludes to Yao's experiences back in China as it shows how he learned to adjust to a life as an NBA All-star. The book is informative and entertaining while it keeps one in constant exclamation over Yao's height, sizes, dreams, and experiences.The physical book itself provides a good read with its medium size and clear print. Yao's stardom also makes the book a worthwhile collector's item.If you are not much of a Yao Ming fan, however, you will probably not enjoy this book. It talks about him almost exclusively, and glimpses into Chinese basketball and cross-cultural struggles are given only from his perspective. Still, if you are collecting athlete biographies, this is not one to overlook."
1,Ohhh ick!,"This frosting is sweet, and it is low in calories. Whenever I come across the term ""cloying"" I think of this frosting. It is sweet and sticky and has an obvious chemical taste. I also have had difficulty obtaining a frosting like consistency. I enjoy using the Sweet 'N Low cake mixes so the first few times I used this product I assumed I had not followed the directions properly. (Okay, so the directions were basically to add water and beat.) If you have to have sugar free frosting on your cake I suggest using the Sans Sucre brand dessert mousse mix and spreading it quickly on the cake as you would a whipped frosting."
5,LOCA ME HUBIERA VUELTO EN MI,"PRIMER EMBARAZO SI NO HUBIERA SIDO POR ESTE LIBRO !Antes de leerlo ( en el tercer mes ) tenía miedos, pesadillas y dudas al por mayor !Este libro fue como mi psiquiatra: Me dio paz, conocimientos y trabquilidad...¡LO AMO !"
3,Some interesting pieces,"I enjoy several pieces in this book that I cannot find elsewhere. The author also uses some alternative materials -- clear paper (for a ship in a bottle model. BTW, this is very difficult, I have not been able to make it.)The downside to this book is that there don't seem to be many things to make."
5,A great book,"This first edition of this book is a treasure. It was reprinted later, but roughly the second half of the book is missing in that edition, so get one of these older copies if you can.The book offers a variety of interesting folds, ranging from simple to complex. It also has very nice full-color photos of the models."
5,Great Christmas CD,"This CD has become one of our family favorites and is always the first one played when we start our card making and Christmas decorating. We can all sing the words to every song. I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite tune but I adore Bells over Belfast and Miss Fogarty's Christmas Cake. You can not go wrong with such an upbeat Christmas CD and I'm looking forward to picking up the newest one, Merry Merry Time of Year."
5,Irish celebrations,"Growing up, my father always played a variety of Irish music, especially on Christmas. Once I was married and had a home of my own, I really missed listening to Irish music on Christmas. This CD isn't the same music that Dad always played, but it evokes the same atmosphere of joy and celebration in a typically rollicking Irish manner. I'm so glad I bought it! Christmas feels more homey to me now."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"As much as I liked the wide-angle lens for the Olympus SP-310, I do not like this telephoto lens. It is a fixed lens, so its usage is extremely limited. The lens is not worth money and is only useful at close-range.Olympus TCON-17F 1.7x Tele Conversion Lens for Olympus SP-310/350 Digital Cameras"
2,Very little increased telephoto capability - NOT WORTHY!,2 stars - because it works... read on: I tried this unit out as soon as I got it... and holding the camera in place by hand and attempting to zoom in on a subject ... I got nothing but a slightly blurred picture. If you purchase this lens - be ready to use a rock steady tripod for quality pictures. The 1.7 x enhancement really is not worthy overall ... and to think that I almost paid Olympus full MSRP from their site! Unfortunately I found it here at a good price point. Bottom line do not buy this or the adapter that allows you to attach it to the camera. It is not worthy of use by a casual camera photographer ... and for an enthusiast - IF YOU are using a camera like this... God bless you!
1,I have always liked rowing,this is not about rowing.It was about somthing else. I was very disapointed. It might get 1 star.
3,Not for the experienced duelist,"I borrowed this game and kinda never gave it back XD oh well he kept mine too ^-^This game is repetitive and not for an oldbie of the game. A great game to teach you to play, though.""entering standby phase""""entering main phase 1""etc.gets very annoying, and takes up a lot of time.I'm going to stick with The Sacred Cards and the real card game, and go try to get my old game back."
4,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME YOU CAN MAKE A DECK UP TO 60 CARDS AND IT IS NOT TO HARD LIKE OTHER YUGOH GAMES LIKE THE DUELIST OF THE ROSES (WITCH IS RATHER LIKE CHESS THAN YUGIOH) I HAVE HAD THIS GAME FOR A WHILE AND IT IS DEFINENTLY WORTH THE MONEY YOU WILL GET TONS OF GAME PLAY FOR THE PRICE I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO LIKES YUGIOH AT ALL!!!!!!! I DONT REMEBER THE PROMO CARDS THAT CAME WITH THE GAME BUT THE GAME IS SO AWESOME IT HAS AWESOME COLOR AND STUFFF FOR BEING ON GBA I HAVE HAD THIS GAME SINCE LAST CHRISTMAS AND I AM STILL PLAYING IT !! TRUST ME BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE YUGIOH!
2,Yu-Gi-Oh The Eternal Duelist Soul GBA,"This game is very challenging because thier are more duelist here are all of the characters of the game in each stage:STAGE 1: Tristan Taylor , Tea Gardner , Yugi Muto ,Joey Wheller , & Bakura Ryou.STAGE 2: Espa Roba , Mako Tsunami , Rex Raptor ,Weevil Underwood , & Mai Valentine.STAGE 3: Umbra & Lumis , Arkana , Rare Hunter ( EXODIA DUELIST )Strings , & Marik Ishtar.STAGE 4: Yami Bakura , Ishizu Ishtar , Kaiba Seto , Shadi ,& Yami Yugi ( PHARAOH )STAGE 5: UNKNOWN/Mamimillion Pegasus/Grandpa , Simon ,Duel Computer, & UNKNOWN/Maxmillion Pegasus/Grandpa.Thoes are all the duelistsP.S the UNKNOWN is an UNKNOWN duelist you can't Duel him until thier name appears.And also if you had the GAME SHARK for GBA/ SP you will see all Duelist with: 099 Wins / 000 Loses / 000 Draw that is for all of them."
5,Awesome and Kewl! By shadow_shifter61,"This game kicks...!First, you start off with a deck of cards. And you can duel Joey, tristan, Tea, Bakura, and Yugi in the first section. Yugi is a little easy, and Joey and Bakura are hard to duel. After you duel them enough, you can move on to Weevil, Mai, Rex Raptor, Tusnami guy, and a psychic guy. They are more challenging then the first gang. In the next gang, there's Marik, a rare hunter who has all Exodia cards, Arkana, Lumis and Umbra, and Strings (a guy with a lota errings). Marik could be more challening, but Umbra and Lumis, and Arkana are quite a challenge! I don't know who is in the next section cuz i haven't got that far.And along the way there's tornaments, magazine where you get five cards, and you can choose new packs of cards to duel with. And the best thing is that you can enter passwords for cards you don't have, and you get them for free! You don't have to pay any starchips or notin!!"
5,This game rocks!!!,I suggest that you buy this game.It is extremely fun to make your deck compatible and good.I love dueling all Yugi's friends and this game is fun to play because of all the possible stuations you could be in. If you have a gameboy advance and you like yu-gi-oh trading cards you should definitely buy this game!!
5,Official Rules for Yu-gi-oh,"This game is a lot different from DDS or Forbidden Memories. It includes every Yu-gi-oh game card ever created and it includes all the official rules of the Yu-gi-oh trading card game. Your deck can now have a maximum of 50 cards and no more star chips, or deck capacity, or duelist level. You can include any cards you wish and all the english cards are there! All the effects are exactly like the real trading card game. It is definetly worth the money. Compared to this, DDS and forbidden memories don't stand a chance."
4,I hear this game stinks but i think otherwise,I was going to get this game fo my b-day but My friend slept over a week earlier and he told me it stinks.I'm not sure if it really does but i'm a huge yugioh fan and i love the cards. I didnt get the game. Instead i got money so i could save up for a different yugioh game and i found one. I found it on this website and i think it is about battle city and that means new monster cards new magic and trap cards it sounds soooo cool. But if you cant wait till april 18 03 then get this game its still yugioh. i hope this review has helped you make sure you want this game.
2,an ok game,"The truth is plane and simple, it's not the best game but it is an addictive game. I was desappointed to see no real battle animation, but it does have a feel to the original trading card game. It does get boring, doing the samethings over and over again, but for a kid i guess it's an ok game. There are better games out there such as Metroid Fusion and Megaman Zero, but eternal soul is not half bad give it a try."
4,Fun Fun Fun!!!,"Well, I bought this game yesterday, and this is fun! It may get boring for some people, but I think that it's pretty good. I'm using my parent's account, but anyways, this is a good game. It may not be the best game for kids under 10, as its rule could be a little hard for them. But it's a good game for 10 to 20. The downsides are that you can not save in the middle of a duel, and that to write passwords take too long."
3,Not all cards are in the game.,"As being new to the Duel Monsters game, I purchased this with the hope of learning the game. The big selling point to me was that you can enter your own cards into the gameboy game so you can practice with your own cards.I was quickly disappointed to learn that not all the cards are in the game. The newest Yugioh deck out called Pharos Servant does have all its cards listed in this gameboy game and therefore will hinder new duelists from proper practice.Over all it's a great game, and teaches you well. However that one flaw really hurts it."
1,Uhhhhhhhhhhhh Yeah Whatever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I like Yu-Gi Oh it is cool. I hate the cards so be like me and don't buy the game even though the game is fun. Bye you might see me on TV. Do me a favor and rate this review very helpful because it is and it will make my mom happy.
5,Great Game,I just got this game yesterday and my first impression was wow! I thought it was going to be terrible because I played the Yu-Gi-Oh! game for game boy color. But this is 100 times better. It's so much fun and there's so much stuff that you can do. Buy it. It's worth the money!
5,yu/gi/oh game,this game shows how to play the game thereal way it is fun good game and should have more side games to.
4,Read! Awesome!,"This game is the best! now you can help unlock the secrets of the duel monsters game that has becom a major hit! This takes the game to a whole nother demension with awesome 3D graphics that are sure to blow your mind! Unlike dark duel stories this has a higher level of strategy with tough oppenets and official rules that you play at home. After each battle you win you can choose a booster pack and you get more booster packs to choose from as the game progresses1 it also has a calander so that after a certian amount of duels <duel=i day> you can get yugioh weekly, yugioh magazine for cards, and weekend duel for rare cards! All in all I give this game 2 thumbs up!"
4,Best Yu-Gi-Oh! game since Forbidden Memories,"This game is the best! It is just like the card game but not the TV show. As a duelist, you pick an Initial Deck and duel people from the show. And if you're lucky enough to own some cards, then you could type the 8-digit password from the cards so you could use them in the game. There is a calendar which tells you the date. There are some events marked by the calendar, such as a tournament and magazine subscription. So whether you're a young kid or adult, try this game and you won't be dissapointed."
5,Yu-gi-oh rules!,"Yu-gi-oh Eternal Duelist Soul is awsome. It's got 5 star graphics,and a 5 star fun rating. The extra parts that were in D.D.S. hit me in the head when I played E.D.S. I put relinquishedin my deck and WHAM! I hit my self on the head because you needed the ritural in the deck. It's a great game for Yu-gi-oh fans who play the card game with full rules."
5,Good Game,This is the best Yu-Gi-Oh! Game yet! all the card games strategies and you can enter your favorite cards!
4,This is going to rock!!,I never played this game but I know it is going to rock so i preorder it from this website. It is going to come soon but it worth the wait for me. I heard it comes with 3 dice cards but i don't even know what they are. DDs will not come close to this as long as you get to have any card in your deck without having tea blocking you from dueling. for all you fans out there IT'S TIME TO DUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Preatty good,"This game is really great but it lacks. Some times you'll find the game is cheating you to beat you. The game has pleanty of cards from real life and the seiries but you could simply buy the stratagey guide and construct a perfect deck frome all the cards and no one would be a match. I am waiting fo Konami to get better on making this series better like the Poke'mon seires. Come on Konami I know you can do it, Just put some effort into it and ask the people!!!"
3,YU-GI-OH!,If your Just looking for a great RPG this might not be the best game for you. But if your into Yu-Gi-Oh! and you've got some time on your hands then you might enjoy it. A cool thing about it is that if yougot a killer deck in real life then you can take the bottom left corner code on the card and put in the pasword section you can get that card so you have the same deck as real life!!! Also if you beat one whole screen of players I think twice a whole new screen comes up! And if you want to work on your Yu-Gi-Oh! Gaming skills your in luck because the rules are exactly the same of those in the card game. So there you have it my review on this three and one half star (in my opinion) Game!!!
2,Not what they picture,A very cheap substitution was made for the pictured set. Do not buy this set. They sent the cheapest possible stamped forceps that make it nearly impossible to grasp the sutures and the scissors are all metal and again the cheapest possible construction. The set pictured works well and as a surgeon for nearly 30 years I know it well. THIS IS NOT THE SET THEY SEND. Buyer beware
3,Dated and poorly organized.,"This book is the compilation of what we know about hormones secreted by the gastro-intestinal tract and their functions. Although the book was published in 1999, it is already out of date and omits such recent discoveries such as ghrelin (which is secreted from the stomach) and adiponectin (which is secreted from the messentrium). It is also very hard to read. Possiblly because it is a compilation of 21 contributions that seem to have been written independently with minimal inter-communication. Poor organization makes it difficult to find the information you are looking for. Although the book gathers gastro-intestinal hormones between a set of covers, there is little explanation of how they inter-relate. I do not strongly recommend this book."
4,Leonard Rosenman's Best Ape Score,"Leonard Rosenman's score for BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is very good. It is a real departure from his BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. BENEATH sounded more like his music for TV's COMBAT series (not a bad thing) while BATTLE is quite distinctive and gives this film a much needed drive to carry it. The CONQUEST score sounds good on it's own but lacks the connection of not having that Jerry Goldsmith sound or Rosenman's unique sound as well. However, this is a very good CD."
3,"A good kayaking story, not a good 'spiritual' story","I know something about Lake Superior, and I respect anyone who manages to paddle a kayak all the way around the lake. That aspect of the book is very entertaining and at times compelling. For anyone interested in reading about sea kayaking, I recommend the book.I thought much less of the author's 'spiritual' journey, and felt that the author was less than honest in describing her situation, or her reason for taking the trip. The author presents the trip as a journey to unknown ends, but I think the author knew very well the decision she was facing and even had a pretty good idea of where she'd end up. If she truly didn't have a clue, I do not think she could have possessed the ability to write the story of the physical journey nearly so well.For the story of the physical journey, A+; for the story of the 'spiritual' journey, C-."
1,Narcissism on the rocks.,"Thought this would be an introspective naturalist's commentary on kayaking in the wild of the Great Lakes. Sharing it with my women friends, they confirmed my judgement that the book is only one woman's whine about her self-absorption. Having help to pay for her needed therapy, I can only hope that the paper is recyclable. At least I didn't suffer a marriage to her as did one poor soul. Don't drown in this one."
2,New Age Mish Mash on Water,"My book club selected this, and I will admit it should generate lively discussion, if only because some of us will hate it, and some will like it. Personally, the new-agey spiritual narrative nauseated me. This lady whips out her personal altar at the drop of a hat; she is ""stunned"" by personal revelation to such an extent I wonder that emergency rooms around the lake weren't on high alert for her presence; she finds signs in things most normal people wouldn't even notice. While she writes about a spiritual journey,and personal transformation, ultimately, this is a story about a frustrated housewife who is figuring out how to get on with the rest of her life and needs a slew of new-age speak to get there."
5,Do you like funny?,Jane Graves--who also writes wonderful humorous novels for Duets and Temptation--is one of the funniest writers around. You'll love the story of John and Renee.I won't go into the plot but want to say that there were times I was laughing out loud. I'll never be able to go through MacDonalds drive through without grinning.
2,"Don't want you, babe","I was very disappointed with this book after reading the reviews. The main character, Renee is supposed to be a bad girl who is reformed but she lies and steals a car from the leading male (a cop) and lights a jeep on fire all in the first few chapters. I couldn't believe anything could ever develop between them after that. I disliked this book because Renee's character seemed weak; relying on female ""wiles"" to save her from the mess she's in."
4,Great router,I've given this router a good workout doing mostly mortising work. It's easy and comfortable to use and very powerful. If the height adjuster was a little smoother to use I'd have given it 5 stars.
4,Good one,"Not sure why you do not get decent measurements to zippos online but here it is.This lighter is small enough that I can put it in a 20 cigaratte pack/box of Marlboros after removing 4 cigarattes, which is what I was looking for. I don't like loosing lighters, disposable or even more a zippo that costs 10 times more to replace.It is about 30 mm wide, 57 mm tall, and 11 mm deep. Or... just over 1 and 1/8 inch wide, 2 and 1/4 inch tall, and almost 1/2 inch deep. I haven't actually weighed it on a scale but estimate it is about 30% lighter by feel than the usual zippo. It might be my imagination but it also does not seem to look so tall and narrow as the picture implies.To fit a more normal normal size zippo into a pack of cigs I have to remove like 7 or 8 cigs at least and squeeze harder to get it in there.Those are about 38 mm wide, 55 mm tall, and 12 mm deep.They are about a mm deeper and this is why they take even more space inside a pack than the width difference would imply."
3,Glad I found it,"My kid was on a powerpuff girls kick after finding some online games, I was very happy to find it here and for a reasonably low price which was great, it took a little longer than expected to deliver but other wise it was in good condition and worked fine right out of the box on Windows XP. It is a great game for the little ones."
1,Not what it seems to be,"I ordered this product for my husband's birthday since he is a huge Big Tiny Little fan. The ad for the product said it's a disk, and the picture of it looked just like a CD package. So I thought I was ordering a CD --WRONG!! It is actually a square diskette that goes into Yamaha player pianos, although there was no mention of this in the ad. I thought that perhaps it could be transferred to a CD, so I called the Hal Leonard Corporation which is the contact listed on the pamphlet that came with the disk. The customer service person could not tell me whether it is merely instrumental or whether Big Tiny Little is singing on it and said that he didn't know anything about it. At my request, he gave me a phone number for Yamaha, but when I dialed I discovered that it was a discontinued number. I feel misrepresented and give this supplier a big fat zero number of stars since there does not seem to be an option for minus stars."
5,Best Unknown Essayist Around,"Daniel Harris is that unusual essayist who writes about popular culture in an informative, unpretentious and humorous way. He doesn't spend all of his time trying to inflate the importance of the subjects of his essays to make himself seem more important. Instead, he just goes about selecting familiar yet unexamined niches of popular culture and reveals the ironies that turn up with wit and enthusiasm. These 10 essays on the aesthetics of consumerism may embarrass some readers when they show how we've been manipulated by corporate marketing, but, ultimately, one can't help but feel enlightened and thoroughly entertained by Harris' writing. As essays as good as these rarely appear in mainstream publications, I would recommend buying this book without hesitation."
2,Eh,"I'm a bit of a shopaholic and I like to read so I buy books often...maybe by the bus load. So durring one of my amazon buy-fests I picked up this book.Now I'm a college kid looking into going to grad school for advertising so I'm no Bimbo and I'm no stranger to text book jabber after 10 semesters in school. This book however cute, funny and interesting, seems to be much more focused on seeing how many great scrabble words Harris can shove into one run on sentence after another. I spent way more time thinking about what kind of context he was using each word in and how that related to anything than actually following the point he was trying to make.I don't know if there is enough adderall in the world to make this book readable."
4,Review,"It is a very interesting book, very complete. The only thing is that inevitably time pass by and the book now is a lit bit out of datas, because in meantime many ingredients were added to gastronomy operations."
3,Coffee Review,"I was surprised at the strength of this coffee's flavor. I have to mix with ""regular"" coffee or it is too overwhelming. Not a problem, just had to play with the mix a bit. Also, I don't like the fact that it has to be refrigerated after opening. I wish I didn't have to order 4 bags at a time, with mixing the coffee it will take me a lot of time to get through 4 bags."
1,I hate women who go stupid,"While this book has all the elements to be a good story, I was so disappointed when the main character Andi Pauldi goes stupid. What non-authority person in their right mind would tackle people who raise dogs to fight? And what is with the graphic child abuse scenes? I threw the book away not finished. Andi Paildi may be a good vet, a good hearted woman, but a real dunce when it comes to danger."
2,"Use your money on ""original"" Platters reissues instead...","""The Platters"" were a golden group in the second half of the 1950's, with pop hit after pop hit. About eight of those songs are presented here in re-recorded versions with at least one original member. Those tracks are actually pretty faithful imitations of the old 45-rpm successes. The other ten songs on this disc, however, are much less interesting: some are tedious recitations, some are totally misbegotten arrangements of tunes that worked well in a different style by another artist. These tracks go as far back as the mid-60's, but the wonderful ""Platters"" sound is scarce on them."
1,"Everything must change, indeed","I bought this CD based on Amazon recommendation and it's the first CD I've purched in years that I'm going to sell back to my local used CD store ASAP. I usually I hold on to all CDs I buy, but this one is just too bad (and i've given it 2 months to grow on me). Horrible, uninspired, been there done that, and it ain't no good. This one doesn't deserve to be anywhere near my prized jazz collection. See ya!"
5,Michael Lington - Everything Must Change,I don't know what is the matter with some of these other reviewers. This is a great CD! This is smooth Jazz sax at its best. Every song strikes a cord with me. Listen to it! You'll love it.
1,Weak Uninspired Effort....!,"I too found the production very very weak...Previous recordings were significant by far. However, on this release he took two steps backwards...This album will definitely visit reject heaven..."
5,A Darío for Our Time,"The poems, prose, and letters in this new edition of Rubén Darío's selected writings are indispensable for readers of poetry with an interest in world culture. Darío is no mere literary figure--though he is certainly major in that category--; Darío is a font and fountain of literature and sensibility that bespeaks the New World, and with the bilingual presentation in this book, his poetry speaks our language as well--better than well, beautifully. For the key element in such a volume is, of course, the translation, and here you find three distinguished, widely recognized translators muscially gifting you with their and Darío's voices in ranges you can sing along with by scanning the lefthand-page Spanish. Old favorites--""The Swans,"" for example--renew themselves here and new discoveries abound.If you read poetry, perhaps even more if you write poetry, ""Rubén Darío: Selected Writings"" demands your attention--now!"
3,Dario's selected writings,"I ordered 2 copies of this book. Delivery was prompt but one of the copies is defective, missing like 10 pages of the introduction. I was of course disappointed."
2,Eh...ok,"It's not one of the worst zombie films out there. There are worse (Zombie Nation). The makeup is was ok. Plot: high school student on a road trip to a debate competition get kidnapped by a drug dealer trying to find the money his partner owes him. They enter a town, cursed by Bloody Bill and get chased by zombies. The movie is pretty slow and not that great. There are some inconsistencies, even at the end. Some things are never explained (such as why Bill's sisters is one of the character's look alike). The story further drags on because they have to wait for the one character to tell the story of the town. They keep him alive long enough for him to tell the story. In conclusion, the movie is ok, but it's sort of a waste of time. But, if you are bored, watch it. The soundtrack is not that bad though."
1,I'm amazed that this got produced...,"Terrible script, poor acting, entirely unlikable characters... I'm glad it was a free sci fi channel viewing."
4,many summers ago,"This CD has ""Inch Allah"", one of his all time great. And of course ""Ton nom"", a charming song, that was perfect for dancing slow with a very special beautiful girl. I hear he is still singing. And his songs from the 60`s will never be forgotten."
1,Poison and does not work,"Not only is this poisonous, but it doesnt work......... IF you can even get it out of the container. Buy a spray instead."
1,xbox stinks,first off i played this game and it really stinked the best choice for a game system would be nintindo gamecube
2,Doesn't give very good starting instrutions,"This game wasn't very fun because when you start the game it just says ""Kill all of the enemy units"" without telling you how to do it."
2,Sounds cool,"I thought that this game would be fun to play. I like many different types of games but this game isn't vary fun. The graphics are okay but all you basically do is kill things before they blow something you need to defend up. Controls are bad in this game in robot mode you cant aim up or down you have to target over the enmty to get your guy to target upwards. The sound effects are really bad. It doesn't seem like you're a big robot it feels like you're a normal person running though hotwhell land or something :P also the sergeant guy who yells orders to you [disappoints],the voice acting isn't good at all and I just wasn't feeling it. I think they should of used a computer narrator sort of like hailo or mechwarrior dose I strongly recommend you rent it before you buy it."
3,"Rent First, this has been rated okay by the beta testers","Before you buy into one of the developers reviews about thisgame. Just go out and rent before you buy. Seriously, theonly game worth owning is Halo, years beyond anything withGTA excluded. Oh, about the game. This is a poor substitute for the upcomming Robotech release that will rock you out around xmas. Yes, with a years worth of dust collecting titles that you only played one and a half times thisone will be played about two. I doubt they will let this review be posted because they want to sell products but oh well..,.,"
3,Fun!!!Fun!!!Do NOT buy though!!!,"This game is fun alright, but luckily for me, I managed to read the reviews for this game first before contepleting of pruchasing it. Fortunately I did NOT buy it!!! I rented it from Blockbuster, and even before I have to return the game, I finished it, no late fees to boot!!!! This game is fun but its too simple that any adult could finish this game in 2 days if they play 3 hours straight everyday. Thats what I did and I must say I am glad I did not buy this game. So my advice is just rent it!!!! You'll be glad you took my advice!!!"
5,DA BEST GAME EVER!!!!,BESIDES HALO...GUN METAL is the best xBox game created! Your a mech robot/high-tech figther pilot!!! You start out with a few puny weapons but the longer you play the stronger the weapons get!!!! I completely and totally recommend this game to any xBox gamer!
2,VERY disappointed!,I'll keep this review simple and give you the highlights since some people were already kind enough to elaborate on all of this game's faults.There is NO plot to this game. It's just a bunch of missions thrown together.Remember playing Command & Conquer and having to protect some equipment or some dumb convoy every once in a while? Remember how much you hated those missions? Well EVERY mission in this game involves you protecting something! IT [stinks]!The narration is SOOO FAKE and annoying. You'd think they could have spent the extra dollar on some realistic narration. I would have expected gaming companies to have learned their lessons from their past mistakes on the fake acting and fake sense of urgency in the voices. They RUIN the game.The graphics are great but barely par for the XBox. The kills are pretty lame.It's got decent gameplay....until you get tired of losing everytime because the convoy you always have to protect gets wasted after a few measely shots.
4,Cool,this game needs one word awesome. Its graphics are geat. Controls easy. One con might be hard for first third person shotter player. At [price] its a good deal. Must have for the xbox.
5,Great Quality,This vest is a great value! Very nice quality and nice looking and for less than other comparable things I had seen elsewhere. I was very happy with it.
4,SWEET,"This game is similar to the extravagent game we know and love as Duel Monsters. This new virtual board game is based on the hit show Yu-Gi-Oh! In several of the episodes a new player describes the rules (vaguely I might add)of this enthralling game. Dungeon Dice Monster's is a game where you set monsters, traps, and magic along a road created by the folding dice (cool!) to create passage that reaches your opponents heart points. Then your attack with your monsters you previously set to defeat your opponent. This is an awesome game. I'd reccommend it to anyone who likes board games or Yu-Gi-Oh!P.S.-don't get lost in the dungeons, trust me your not gonna like it. <lol>"
3,From cards to dice?,"I played this game in its Japanese format. I don't know what changes were made, but I'm a big fan of the Duel Monsters card game. It's not that the game is a difficult one to adapt to, it's just that there are so many rules on the dice and combinations that it makes the gameplay more then a little difficult to understand. Different roles of the dice gives different abilities when matched up correctly. It's not a bad game, in fact, it's easy to get hooked on it. If you've ever played a D&D type game, but with strategy and elements involved, then you should do fine. Personally, I'd rather stick with the card game, but DDM is worth it, if you can get over the rules and regulations/game play, that is."
5,Master Duelist Says:,"This is an over all great game. Another great extension from the great animators of Konami. It has very beautifully animated graphics that can make it #1 for graphics on GBA, they are unmatched to all the others with the exception on Golden Sun: Lost Age. The Game of Dungeon Dice Monsters is like no other Duel Monsters game. Instead of playing with cards you play with small Duel Monsters figurines. The game isnt too complicated but it still takes some getting used to...DDM is one of the greastest duel monsters game ever made because of its unique style of game play and the exciting rules that take duel mosnters to the next level. So when February Rolls around be sure to go pick up your own copy of this amazing game. Trust me you wont regret it!"
3,"A fair game, for those with time to spare...","This game isn't awful, to those loyal to the yugioh monster pack. As anyone could notice the music on this can get really REALLY agitating, so be ready to turn down the sound and boost up your cd player, cause some of these duels can last up to 4 hours! (Depending on difficulty) The graphics are so-so, but for those who have played the Eternal Duelist Soul game for too long (like myself) you will find it amusing and addictive. Again this is only for those who are loyal, otherwise you might just want to rent this one... A slightly annoying 3 out of 5"
2,A bit too unintelligent,"It's a great game concept, it plays out well, and is fun for a while, but the computer player isn't very intelligent, and once you figure out how to beat him, which shouldn't take too long if you pay attention, the fun factor goes way downhill."
3,YU-GI-OH DUNGEON DICE MONSTERS SHOULD BE FUN,This game would be sort of fun. I think it won't be as good as Yu-gi-oh Dark duel stories. What it should have is 5 cards included in the game like Dark Duel stories... People who enjoy yu-gi-oh you should buy it.
4,Great Game!,"I love this game, very fun. Only problem is the learning curve, it takes quite a while to understand the dice and all, but once you understand how to play you wont be able to put it down."
3,Only worth it for under a fiver......,This game is alright i suppose but the oponents are dumber than they look and seem to lose on purpose! it is kinda cool i guess but unless u find it in a game bin for a fiver it really isnt worth it.
4,I'm playing til I win a game with Exodia.,"I'm not sure just how far this game goes, but I have found a good dice combination that has been very successful so far. I use 7 Swamp Battleguards, 2 Rabid Horsemen, 2 Faceless Mages, 1 Cocoon of Evolution, 1 Energy Disk, 1 Skelengel, and 1 Meteor Dragon. These are not exactly a high-level handful, but I used this set of dice to reach Yami Yugi with only 1 loss, then I beat Yami Yugi before he got a single monster on the board. With a little strategy, you can beat a player using level 4 dragons with this setup. You may be a little low on defense at times, but you usually have plenty of movement and attack."
3,IS DUNGEON DICE MONSTERS AS GOOD AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS,I MAY NOT HAVE THE GAME BUT I THINK IT WILL BE AAAAAWWWWWWWEEEESSSSSSEEEOOOOOOOOMMEEEEEEE
1,the [worst] game ever,This game has very bad graphic.Also it has a monster that isn't even true like himonre which attack power is 1200 but has a effect. the effect is your entire deck is nonusable if this card is not in play. so your anly choice isto play it and stop from losinf but it'll die anyway. also if u dont play it then u will lose the duel. ...
1,Zach Schumm says don't buy,this game is terrible! A monkey could play this game! It makes a mocory of everything Yu-Gi-Oh- stands for. Do not buy this game or i'll be mad you didn't listen to me. one of the reasons it's not a good game is because of the dueling style there is. and it has terrible graphics.
3,Not the best,"The PC board arrived and the surfaces were scratched up and slightly gouged. The manufacturer did not properly protect the PC board. It was still functional, but not very attractive."
2,I returned them!,I ordered 2 of these to replace my aging nightstands and I was quite disappointed! One arrived with a long scratch across the top and the other had poor stain application. The stain/finish was missing in a small area and another area had a huge drip. I made the mistake of not reading carefully enough and missed out on the fact that these were not real wood but laminate and they really look it. The drawers were roomy but I doubt they would stand up to any real weight for very long. Not worth the money in my book!
4,Wicker storage unit,This was advertised as a kitchen storage bin. I am using it as storage for office items that don't go in a file drawer.
3,Experimental Fusion,"This album mixes prog-rock and fusion and some symphonic bombast to get a distinctly European sound. The title track puts guitarist Rypdal in front of a full orchestra which turns out to be a little dull in its stuffy seriousness. The other two tracks, ""Silver Bird is Heading for the Sun"" and ""The Hunt"" fare much better, with Rypdal's electric guitar complemented by electric piano, mellotron and french horn for music that falls in between In a Silent Way era Miles Davis and early King Crimson."
1,Not as advertised!!,"As mentioned like other feedback, the package did not say that these ball are ""Air-Filled ""Phthalate Free"" non-PVC LDPE Plastic Balls."" which highly suggests that they are not. Balls are thin compared to other similar balls. You get what you paid for."
5,Best balls around!!,I got these balls to go in my son's large ball pit. They are awesome!! They are way bigger and more durable than the ones I could have picked up from my local big chain stores. I researched and tried a variety of different ones and I was definitly more pleased with these balls!! You will not regret buying them!!
4,BALLS,"PRODUCT ARRIVED IN DECENT TIME, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN PACKAGED BETTER, SO THE KIDS COUILDN'T SEE WHAT IT WAS .....YOU KNOW SANTA AND ALL!"
1,100 DENTED balls,"How cheap! I guess you really do get what you pay for! Every single ball was dented upon opening them out of the bag. They are also made of very thin flimsy plastic so that even if you barely press against the ball it's dented even more so. Unless you plan on giving these to a newborn baby who won't move around them, then save your money. My kids don't want to play with balls that are smoooshed. How sad!"
3,Small House Miscellaneous Candy Mold Chocolate,I did not have the mold to make the complete house. My intention was to make a house and I was unsuccessful because this mold made half the housenot have the mold to make the complete house
4,It's a great addition for Gundam fans,"With Fed. vs. Zeon, Bandai finally stepped up and had Capcommake a game for them. The result is one of the best anime spin-offs on record. Arenas (based on episodes from the series) host tag-team battles with four moblie suits dukin it out. The selection of levels includes lands and space with each offering thier own challenge, in addition to mastering the distinctly different types of mecha. If you've played a Gundam game before, the atmosphere should be familiar, but the controls are thankfully much tighter, and the mission-based single-player stands up well compared to the versus action. The graphichs could be sharper, but this is still the first Gundam game serious fans of the series should not be ashamed to play."
3,The minor problems that only I seem to dislike or even notic,"Ok, this is a good satisfying game. the problems is the fact that when you use your weapon, your MS stalls and when you hit an enemy, the enemy floats around and is not able to be hit. Also, it contradicts known facts. I destroyed over 50 Gound Combat Gundams and the fact is that only about 20 were made. Also, a beam saber is equal to a heat hawk! A beam saber is much stronger and I do not get why the beam saber doesn't chop the enemies in complete half with one stike! Also, the game is a 2 on 2 game making the big and epic battles like A Baoa Qu and Solomon seem like a samll skirmish. Basically after all that, it is much better than Zeonic Front and a succesor to Journey to Jaburo."
4,really great!!!!!,"this game as awsome graphics and great gamelaay. also, unlike the other bandai games, you get to fight in space. it rocks!!!"
1,Buyer beware,"I just received this mouse & discovered that it does not support the Mac platform. Although certain aspects work, they don't work well. This is money that would have been better spent on an Apple mouse in the first place. Build quality is fair with sloppy trackball movement.One last thing Compaq... are you aware of the growing base of Mac users? Shame on you for not supporting the Mac platform. Very bad business, very poor mouse!!!"
1,[...],"[...]1. John Boos boards only come in two thicknesses: 1.5"" and 2.25"".2. These the 20 x 15 x 1.5"" inch board should be priced around $51.95 - not over $80.00 as it is here.Take a look at this Amazon listing, I think this is the correct one:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063QBEK/002-5947212-5273636?v=glance&n;=284507&n;=468536&no;=%2A&s;=kitchen&v;=glance"
1,I wish that I never bought it.,I wish that I never bought it. I will never buy another one. Buying this product was a very big mistake.
1,Developed a rough texture and warped within a month,"I'm a big fan of Boos traditional butcher blocks, but this clearly does not live up to the standards of Boos. I picked this up for my short stint in a small apartment where my butcher block was not practical. I oiled regularly, but the board developed a rough texture and begin to warp after a few weeks. I was useful for what it was, but will not make the trip back home and will find itself in a landfill.Do yourself and stick with the thicker, end grain butcher blocks."
1,Split,"I've had this board for over a year and just noticed that it's warped and split down the middle. The significant thing is that I don't use it for chopping! I bought it for its size and the way it looks to cover the surface of a cart, and my juicer and blender sit atop it. It's never been oiled, but it's never been wet either. I'm surprised and disappointed."
2,Splitsville,"Right off the bat, I don't oil my cutting boards but once a month but I do dry them right away so they don't stay soaked. However, I don't think that should mean that these boards should start to split where the boards were glued together after a few months. Mine are splitting at the ends. I have a bamboo salad bowl that is made up of many pieces of bamboo glued together, I have never oiled it and I never wipe it dry right after washing it. It looks great, same as the day it was new and it must be at least a year old so I know glued wood can hold together. And my old cutting board gave me several years of use before it started to split. I both have this size board and a Boos 10x10,both are splitting. They look great but unless you plan to devote a portion of your life to maintain an item that I think should be wash and go, I would look elsewhere. Too $$ to be a germ trap."
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered the product and like anything newly purchased, I wiped it down with a wet sponge and dried it. The wood feathered and splintered immediately. The company was incredibly responsive and sent me another board practically the same day! I returned the original board but the same thing happened to the 2nd one! I returned it the same day for a refund. I guess you get what you pay for!"
3,warps very quicky,"I requested this as a gift, based on a review in Cook's Illustrated magazine. Positive: large surface creates a nice size work area. Negatives: First: it is a very heavy board, which makes it a little tough to pick up and wash, and its large size means that it does not fit into any of my cupboards or dish rack (so I have to leave it on my stovetop to fully air-dry after towel-drying). Second: within 1 week of use, the board is already warping. I treated it with mineral oil before I ever used it, have been washing and drying it immediately after each use, but it is warping. Third: the surface is irregular to begin with - not planed to a smooth surface. Overall: disappointing performance, not what I expected from the review in Cook's Illustrated. I would not recommend this product."
3,Good Quality But.....Get the Thicker Models,"I bought the 20 X 15 X 1.25 inch model (at Cutlery and More) and it warped within a month when cleaning only with a damp cloth. Fortunately they replaced it and paid the return shipping. The first one appeared to be unfinished without a protective sealer, a quality control problem. The replacement board has not warped after a year's use, but I believe the thicker models are less prone to warping."
2,warped and cracked within 2 weeks,"I'm very disappointed. The board looked perfect when it arrived, but it has warped and cracked at one of the seams in less than 2 weeks! It's been lying flat the entire time and hasn't been wet. It certainly didn't live up to my idea of John Boos quality."
1,Warped and begun cracking,"I haven't even had this board for 3 weeks when it started warping. Then I noticed it's cracking at the end too, and glued seams are coming apart. I oiled the damn thing per manufacturer suggestion, dried it and protected it from heat from day one. Wish I had read the one star reviews prior to buying this piece of firewood."
3,BooS Boards,"I received the Maple Chop & Slice 1 1/2"" board for Xmas '09, and despite all the hype, I am disappointed with it. It began to split within a few weeks and now has several splits. As a home chef, I use the board daily, it is not allowed to remain 'wet' (such as with fruit juices), is wiped clean after each project and is wiped clean and dried, not immersed. It was conditioned before use and regularly since. Therefore, the three stars. Otherwise, the size and weight is great. If I had to buy one (which I probably will sooner than later) again, I would opt for an end cut and thicker board.BTW, anyone know if there is a warranty on their products? I emailed BooS customer service but never received a reply."
1,a bad on slipped through QC,"I have 2 of these boards. Bought them at the local restaurant supply store, and love them both. However, for Christmas I decided to send my daughter one as a gift. I bought it on Amazon because of their superior shipping...I'm at her house now for a visit and got a chance to look at, and use her cutting board. What a piece of crap. It's warped badly, cracked on one side, and has a rough finish. I'm totally disappointed. Not sure what happened to this board, but it certainly slipped through the Boo's quality control and got shipped to my daughter. Guess that's a lesson learned for me, don't buy a Boo's cutting board unless you can inspect it first in the store."
3,Nice with a few small issues,"For the price, I think this is a great cutting board. My issues are that (1) it is much lighter than it looks in the photo; it's almost whitewashed. And (2) when I run my hand over the surface, it is so rough it feels like I am going to get a splinter. Maybe I just received one that wasn't sanded? That's how it feels, on both sides."
2,Frayed and split.,"Terrible quality, frayed and split after prolonged use. We didn't wash it in the dishwasher. We also oiled it with mineral oil before the first use.Over hyped brand, nothing more.The only thing preventing me from giving it 1 star is that it didn't completely fall apart."
1,complete disappointment,I found the history of sign language and culture to be ok but beyond that the book was terrible. As a parent of a deaf child and trying to learn ASL I found nothing useful at all to help me learn to sign and speak the language which will become my child's. I was sorely disappointed that only a few paragraphs were available on the actual grammar of ASL.As a beginner to ASL it was discouraging. I finished the book with less enthusiasm about learning it then when I had started and I am now unsure whether I would even want my child to be involved in the deaf culture and community since the main feeling I got was that deaf people are unaccepting to anyone who is not deaf. I got the impression that even trying to learn ASL was a stupid idea and I would never be good at it becuase I am hearing.
1,Offensive and Insensitive Title,"I agree - the person who wrote this book is an ""idiot"" - it took many years for the deaf to overcome the ""deaf & dumb"" stigma...and now there is a book written about the deaf with ""idiot"" as part of the title - which is clearly deragatory ! obviously - the author did not bother to research the community. The author needs to think before publishing. Signed - child of deaf adults"
1,Not something I'd want my students to use!,"Yesterday, one of my students brought to class a copy of this book. I teach Sign, and about Deaf culture. I, myself, am hard-of-hearing. Just for starters, on the first page, we looked at an alphabet full of errors! It was as though someone who didn't know the fingerspelling alphabet had played ""cut and paste."" Hand-shape letters were not near the same designated printed letter. And one hand-shape, looking like no letter in particular, drawn without a thumb, was included in the mix. Looking further through the book, drawings were expressionless. It was difficult to recognize motion or direction in the drawn signs. ...And I know what the signs should look like! Looking for background on the authors, I read that one is an interpreter. Yikes! :-("
1,Not a particularly good resource,"I have read other ""complete idiots guides"" and they can be good resources for beginners. However, this one falls short. It's unclear, easily misinterpreted and inaccurate in places. It gives an slightly less than OK assessment of deaf culture and does not even begin to give the reader an understanding of ASL."
1,"Complete Idiot, indeed","Well, the book's not all bad . . . For example, the attempt to describe Deaf culture is successful on a very basic level, and the illustrations are attractive, if not particularly useful. That, however, is the main problem- the uselessness of the illustrations. It's as if a textbook on French wrote ""gkhukyf"" instead of ""bonjour""! There's also relatively little on grammar, other than an acknowledgement that there is such a thing as ASL grammar (which is a good first step but by no means the last. Try A Basic Course in American Sign Language by Humphries, Padden, and O'Rourke. And definitely practice with native signers!"
4,It Truely Was A Life To Remember,"Kudos to Azarel! I read this book in 24 hours. ""A Life to Remember"" was a good read. Once I started reading I was not able to put the book down. Azarel kept it real and gave us a true but sad insite into prison life. The characters were well developed and Azarel kept you wondering what was going to happen next. I must admit I was a little disappointed with the ending but overall this was a good book.Chiquita of PSSST!! Book Clubwww.pssst.1colony.com"
2,mediocre@ best,"Freshman novel by Azarel is not that good a read, her story telling style is rather bland. Having worked in the Virginia dept of corrections and being a witness to some of the scenarios the character Divine Jones spoke of was somewhat comical, though mostly accurate, most were not realisticly told in my opnion. The editing could have been a little better as well, all told I wouldn't break my neck reading any more of her books and definitely would not purchase another."
5,off tha riiiippppp!!,"my boy breed put it down with this album.But what made it so much better, my boy pac was on it. And u no when those 2 get 2 getter, something extraordinary is about to take place."
3,Madden,Madden is the way to go! I have played both and the only thing 2K3 has on Madden is Live enabled.
4,Better than Madden,"NFL 2K3 is much better than Madden in all major categories: graphics, gameplay, etc. My only complaint with Sega's football games is the ability to see your opponent's play calling. At least in Madden your opponent knows you could be running one of three plays that appear on the screen. Still, a minor gripe considering all the ways in which this game is superior to Madden."
5,GREAT GAME!,I ALREADY BOUGHT THIS GAME FROM A FAMOUS RETAIL STORE. I MUST SAY THAT THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST FOOTBALL GAME EVER! THE GRAPHICS & SOUND ARE GREAT. THE TACKLES ALONE ARE SUPERB AND WAIT TO YOU SEE THE REPLAYS. UNBELIEVEALB!BUY THIS NOW FROM FROM AMAZON{.COM} YOU WILL REALY ENJOY THIS GAME A LOT. BUY IT NOW!
5,Sega makes the best games.,As a rule I pretty much only buy Sega games because they are high quality and innovative. Sega's NFL 2k3 is a perfect example of how great Sega games are. Sega has no peers when it comes to sport games.
4,"Yeah, good graphics, but gameplay is not as good.","I got this game the other day and was dissapointed, although I gotta say, I'm one of those Madden Fans, so I may be a little bias. I think that this game is good, but unlike madden, I wasen't craving to play the game all night or anything, I mean, the graphics are the best on any football game to date, but the gameplay seemes to slow for me and just simply not fun. However, the replays, cut-scenes, and tackles are really cool to watch...much better than madden. Remember, this game is more like NFL Blitz or something, and if you want a football simulator, you should not bother with it. But if you like a more arcade style football game with awsome graphics, than you'll like this game."
1,Is everyone blind?,"Why does everyone love this game so much? I can spend an hour going over all the negatives I found playing this frustrating game. Did they do any user testing when they developed it? This game is more flash than substance. It cannot hold a candle to Madden. The ONLY good quality about this game is that you can play it live. EA and Microsoft are being stupid and not allowing Madden to go online for Xbox, so if you want to play Live, get this game, but don't bother with anything else. Just be prepared for unrealistic football play."
5,AWESOME!,I got the game as soon as it came out and its the best football game ever. If you want realism get NFL2k3 if you want fake Blitz like play then get Madden.
1,what you see is not what you get,the actual image on the banner is not the same as the one shown on the site..super poor quality. theres got to be quality control in relation towhat a seller purports to be selling
3,"A good read, but an unnecessary one at that...","One of the quotations on the back of this books calls this, ""an engaging study...of one of the more diificult authors of the seventeenth century."" I agree with the first part--this book is very well written and interesting--but not the second--it deals with La Rochefoucauld as if he was difficult, which he surely, read carefully enough without any presumptions, is anything but. If you consider the frenchman a philosopher, than he is surely-- with Machiavelli's ""Prince"" the closest exception--the easiest of the bunch to understand. There is one small gripe that I have: the author includes many quotations of other works, but does not translate them except in an appendix in the back of the book. Hardly a big deal, but still a ""deal,"" making the read rather clunky at times."
2,"sad, boring and redundant","I read A Walk to Remember and could not put it down. Yes, you will cry but it is worth it. It is a beautiful book. Next, I read A Bend in the Road. This was very good with a satisfying ending. I recommend the two above mentioned books. My last book by Nicholas Sparks was Message in a Bottle. The book goes on and on! First, you hope they break up. Then you think Theresa is a jerk and then you think Garrett cannot make a committment. Then when you aren't looking, the gut-wrenching ending hits you in the face like a bucket of cold water. I made the mistake of reading it prior to Christas and it was really sad. I didn't need to mourn and cry over the loss one of the characters. Wow! It was almost like the entire relationship wasn't worth the trouble since it was never going to work out. I would like to have a story written about Garret and Catherine...without the sad ending. If you are a fan, buy it. If not, read A Bend in the Road."
1,original premise blown by implausible dialogue,"Starting out on the book, I was initially thrilled with all the possibilities that could happen as a result of the premise of the book. Boy, was I disappointed at the typical ""romance"" novel dialogue and story progression. I thought both Theresa and Garrett were unrealistic and one dimensional characters. The only person that left me with any sort of connection was Jeb. This was the 1st Nicholas Sparks novel I have read and it will be the last for awhile. I hope the movie is better!"
2,"Dissappointing after the wonderful ""Notebook""","Easy to read, and tries hard to pull you in,but not really as emotional as you think it would be, and why did the hero have to die? Seems kind of contrived. did enjoy reading about Wilmington NC it is beautiful there as well as Cape Cod, maybe the movie will be better, Kevin Costner and Paul Newman are well cast,maybe the scriptwriters will infuse it w/more emotion, more like ""The Notebook"", which I highly reccommend"
4,A Realistic Look At The Unexpected Price Of Love.,"This book was easy to read and lose your in. It shows that it is never too late to find love and that love can be powerful and emotional. Not all love stories have a happy ending (just like in real life) and it was refreshing to have a book end with something other than ""happily ever after"". Nicholas Sparks did a wonderful job with both of his novels and I can't wait for the next one!!"
4,"Thoughtful, tender and moving.","I enjoyed this book very much except for the ending-it was just too sad. I think it sends the message that you need to appreciate what you have while you have it because you never know when you may lose it. I couldn't put the book down and now that I'm finished, I'm passing it along to a friend. The author knew what he was writing about: sailing, diving, weather. And the letters? He knows how to write the kind that every woman would love to get!"
5,Loving is one of the greatest gifts of all,"I have to say message in a bottle is one of the most compelling love storys I have ever read! This book takes you through the lives of 2 individauls, the power of love between them and the never ending heartache that is caused-. If you liked ""the notebook"" then I promise you that you will love ""message in a bottle"" -"
1,See the movie,"I kept thinking that this book would make a good screenplay. It did not make a good book. Nicholas Sparks has some good, though simple, ideas for a plot. Problem is: he can't write. This book is better suited in the junvenile section of a library where an author's ability to use detail to enhance a story does not matter. His publisher has done a great job selling Sparks. Perhaps they can find him a better editor to improve his writing."
1,Fifth Grade Drivel,"I could only force myself to read to maybe page 55. I don't know if perhaps Mr. Sparks writing method is to write as if his main readership is 5th graders, but I could not handle the 7 word sentences. And words that do not reach past 2 syllables. I have read a few reviews of Mr. Sparks novels and they have stated ""fast read"". I like reads that are fast paced, that you don't want to put down. But this read is ""fast"" in that, as an adult, it will only take you 1/2 an hour to finish. If you can force yourself to actually complete it.However, if you like books that don't challenge your mind, like a vacation at Disneyland for the brain, go ahead and read this novel. But from seeing the movie, it's not really a happy book, so forget Disneyland. A vacation at your local WalMart. That's more apt a metaphor."
1,Excruciating.,"When the cable show ""Dinner and a Movie"" showed the movie version of this book, their recipe of the week was ""Tear Jerky"". Quite appropriate; this book is nothing but a weep-fest.Here's a thought: Maybe Theresa can get together with Landon from ""A Walk to Remember""."
2,"When all else fails, go for the tears","Having failed to raise much emotion with the first 350 pages of the novel, the author attempts to go for a tear-jerker ending. For the majority of the book, the female protagonist manipulates her male counterpart towards the ""discovery"" of true love. Ironically rather inspiring the reader to believe in the concept of ""true love"" this book redefines true love to be a desperate fight against loneliness with only one possible winner. Needless to say the winner is not the gullible male lead. If you feel compelled to read this book, I recommend breezing through the first 350 pages. The last 20 pages are the only ones that inspire something other than boredom."
1,One Star Too Many,"Perhaps those who endeavor to teach the English language should use ""Message in a Bottle"" as an example of how not to write fiction. The fact that this poorly-written book made it, not only to publication, but also to best-seller status, remains a mystery to me. I'd like to know where Nicholas Sparks' editor was when he/she read the following passage (page 170 of the copy I borrowed from my library): ""She was short of breath as she reached for the snap on his jeans. Meeting his eyes again, she unsnapped them, then slowly slid the zipper down."" This image of eyeballs with snaps and zippers is horrifying, to say nothing of painful, and it's only one of a thousand glaring stupidities in a banal and trite little book. I finished reading it merely to see just how much worse the plot and writing could get. I wasn't disappointed. It fulfilled all of my lowly expectations."
2,Dissapointed by ending,"This is the 2nd Nicholas Sparks book I've read (the first being A Walk to Remember). This book was quite dissapointing to me - the first half had nice character development and an interesting plot. Then the story started getting strange: they slept together on the 2nd date, the writing started getting repetitive, ect... Maybe the author was working on a strict deadline and the 2nd half was just finished too quickly to make much sense. Just my opinion!"
4,Better than the movie,"I saw the movie first, and then decided to read the book. I thought the book was much better than the movie, even though I loved the movie..The book was much more detailed and the story was better....."
4,Wonderful Dissapointment!!!!!,"I went to see this movie yesterday and I left with my emotions in an uproar. When I say wonderful dissappointment i mean that i was dissappointed in the ending of movie but it was wonderful that i could feel such emotions. The whole theater was emotional and touched by this movie. We all know that everyone looks for a happy ending, but this movie ended so real and so heart wrenching. The movie did what it was supposed to do."
1,Boring and predictable with soap opera dialogue,"I was deeply moved by this book, not to tears, but to yawns. I would give it no stars at all. The characters did not come alive. It might have made a short story for a woman's magazine, but a novel? The plot was predictable from the first page, the pedestrian writing was soporific, and umgrammatical in places. I'm glad I waited for the paperback and didn't waste the money on a hard-cover copy."
2,predictable and diasppointing.,I was very dissappointed in this book. I thought the characters could have been developed more and even better. I really felt manipulated into crying at the end. The whole thing just wasn't natural.
3,This is a curl-up with a quilt book.,"After reading several other reviews, I decided to add my own. ""Message"" is a good book for a sluggish late-winter day, a warm fire and a cozy quilt. Don't read it expecting it to be more than that, but Nicholas Sparks does an excellent job creating what many might call a ""chick book"" despite his gender. Some of the reviews have missed the irony of the story and the message it provides. Garrett Blake is indeed a man of the 90s, and he talks to women and men. If you go see the movie, don't read the book. After seeing Paul Newman's performance as ""Dodge"", that character in the book is a poor comparison."
2,Disappointing,"After having read ""The Notebook"" I couldn't wait to get my hands on ""Message in a bottle"". To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. The characters didn't ring true and the story starts to lose its thread toward the middle. I will have to re-read ""The Notebook"" to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
4,I couldn't put it down!,All I can say is that this book was definitely a tear jerker. A love story that makes a person really think.
3,Message in a Bottle by Nicholas Sparks,Almost gave up on this one half-way through. I am glad that I decided to keep reading though because it actually turned out to be pretty good. This is my third Nicholas Sparks novel and my overall impression so far is that his writing is full of emotional pull but is lacking in any real substance. I would recommend his books for a nice beach read or to take with you on vacation.
1,You have got to be kidding!,"Being from the same hometown as Sparks, I REALLY wanted to like this book. But, after reading it, I have to say that I cannot believe how many good reviews this book has gotten. Actually, I can't believe that this book got published. It is that bad. The only good thing that I can say about this book is that the concept was good. But, the writing was absolutely horrible. It was very dumbed down, trite and any other adjective you want to use to emphasize how bad the writing is. As a previous reviewer said, ""The book is usually better than the movie, but in this case, the opposite is true."" My advice -- watch the movie, don't read the book."
2,I loved the movie and sort of liked the book,"It's probably safe to say that the book is usually better than the movie, but in the case of Message in a Bottle, it is the reverse. The story, itself, is a nice idea. Finding a message about a man's undying love for his wife would get most women and their libidos racing to find ""man with love expressive language."" You can ask most single women, and I guess married ones too, how often they hear a man express his love, passionately, to them or anyone else. The answer will probably not surprise you so, when a woman senses this in a man, even if he is expressing it for another woman, said woman will want it, at any cost. Sparks mixes his metaphors, and continued to ignore the verb-object agreement. For the most part, the book read like it was done by a first-time, romance novelist."
3,Sappy? Yep. Enjoyable reading on a rainy afternoon? Maybe.,"I don't want to be too hard on this book since I at least enjoyed parts of it (and I thought the basic storyline had promise), but I'm also glad it wasn't any longer or I probably wouldn't have finished reading it. The plot really isn't that convincing, the main characters are almost silly -- the dialogue at times sounds like it was written for day-time television -- and, frankly, it just strives to high heaven to be 'poignant' in capital letters. If you think ""The Bridges of Madison County"" is one of the best books you've ever read, you'll probably really enjoy this one too."
4,Love lost,"This is the story of two people who met, by the help of the sea. It was the message in the bottle that drove Theresa to seek for Garret, and inevitably, she falls in love with him. A new relationship may be in the offing, if not for Garret's reluctance. The memory of his dead wife keeps getting in the way, partly because of guilt, despair and of course the promise of undying love. The story was lightly written, giving description of the beautiful sea and life in that little sea town. It makes one's heart float and smile in the course of the story then dramatically breaks your heart as the story ends. A rather tearful ending for what could be a promise of new love. Makes me want to believe that Catherine claimed her love after all. Once more I have proven that a book is still better than the screen."
2,Yawn!,"Trite, cliched, a glorified harliquin romance. Nice if you're looking for something to pass the time or enjoy having your emotions easily manipulated by dripping sentimentality, but if you actually want to read something other then the standard soap opera fare then don't waste your time. I tried really hard to like this book, but it's predictablity and lack of depth (yes, it dealt with ""deep"" subjects but in the shallowist way possible) left me cold."
1,"If only ""zero stars"" existed as a rating",This book was extremely painful to read to the point that I could not even finish the novel. The plot is ridiculous and the writing cliched. The whole idea that a woman would chase after some guy because she finds his love letter at the beach is one of the most pathetic plots I have ever heard of and is insulting to women. The dialogue between the two characters stimulates as much excitement as trip to the dentist. Even idle curiosity about how the book would end could not sustain me.
5,The book and the movie was wonderful!,"I have read the book and viewed the movie. It was a very good movie, but very sad. I definetly didnot like the ending. It was such a let-down after all the endless soul-searching they went through to end like that. However, I cried through both. I love movies and books such as this. The choice of actors was good."
4,MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE,I SAW TH MOVIE FIRST BUT I MUST SAY THAY NOW THAT I READ THE BOOK ; I AM VERY DESSAPOINTED IN THE MOVIE. THERESA A DIVORCED MOTHER & COLUMNIST TAKES A WALK ON A BEACH & FOUND A MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE THAT WILL CHANGE HER LIFE. SHE MEET GARETT & SHE WILL CHANGE HIS LIFE... BEAUTIFUL STORY & WHAT AN UNEXPECTED END ! THE END.... THAT'S WHERE MY PROBLEM IS NOW TOWARDS THE MOVIE ; BECAUSE GARETT DID NOT DIE BY TRYING TO SAVE PEOPLE WHILE HE WAS SAILING BUT BY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING (I WON'T SAY WHAT IN RESPECT OF THE PEOPLE WHOM DID NOT READ THE BOOK YET) THAT STARTED THEIR WHOLE STORIE IN THE FIRST PLACE. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK
4,It is an excellent book!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This book will make you laugh and cry. A wonderful story that will keep you reading until the end.
1,"Predictable, shallow, disappointing","Message in a Bottle is mainly exposition-- long on melodrama and short on character development and genuine depth. The messages in the bottle that Teresa finds are supposed to provide the flesh and blood of their writer, Garret Blake. Instead, they are merely corny and cliched weepings of a shallow and maladjusted man. Teresa is no deeper. The love affair between Garret and Teresa is merely the set-up, by Sparks, for the tragedy. Garret never gets over the death of his wife, so of course he will have to die at sea--- his messages in bottles live on, of course. And then so does Teresa's message to the now-dead Garret. It's a novel full of glass bottles full of messages to dead people. Maudlin, sentimental, and predictable. In fact, the story is so shallow, no wonder Kevin Costner was picked to play the lead in the movie version."
1,Don't waste 90 minutes of your life!,"This might have made a fine short story. All of the filler was sooo boooring! Stupid woman, stupid man. What a waste of time."
1,The worst book I have ever read!,"People in highschool can write better than Nicholas Sparks! The style was overly-simplistic combined with a far-fetched story. I know, its fiction, but come on, a little bit of the ""real-life"" element would help. After reading this book I'm even more convinced that men (espeically ones like Sparks) should not be writing romance novels. I thought the book was somewhat sexist, emphasizing sex and looks above all else. There was too much dialogue (which goes along with the simplicity) and not enough character/setting development. I've always considered myself a hopeless romantic, but this is ridiculous."
1,"Oh, Please","A recently divorced mom, Theresa Osborne, discovers a message, in a bottle no less, that sends her on a whirlwind of adventure and emotion. Well, there's not much adventure, but the treacle more than compensates. Be prepared to have your emotions mercilessly manipulated. Or if, like me, you find the characters and plot of this novel entirely unconvincing and unmoving, prepare to give your eye-rolling muscles a good workout. You'll see the shocking turns-of-events coming a mile away and will actually, witness the shocking turns-of-events if you can burrow your way through Sparks' trite, breathless, compendious prose. Readers with weak stomachs may wish to look away during Garret's letters."
1,"Only because there was no ""0"" star rating","Horrid. Insipid. Drivel. The characters are unbelievable and one-sided. The male ""love interest"" needs serious therapy, not a relationship. For that matter, the woman who would entertain a relationship with a man so obviously fixated on his dead wife could use some head-shrinkage. I found myself impatient with the plot, and with the writing. The characters are repeatedly described as ""just knowing"" how the other one feels, or magically intuiting the right thing to do. Only 12 year-olds, or the severely emotionally immature could possibly think this is the way a relationship works. By the end of this stinker, I was rooting for the storm. If this guy is your ideal; if he makes your heart flutter; be prepared for a painful and unsatisfying love life."
5,Wonderful,"I loved this book! Even though the story was known to me having seen the film version a few years ago, I really enjoyed the book. Perhaps the perfect holiday read!"
5,Wondeful story of love and heartache!,"I found Message in a Bottle impossible to put down. It is not the same as the Notebook, but just as good! I read it on a plane and cried so hard the people around me kept whispering. I say READ IT!"
1,"Shallow, trite dialogue, no bang for the buck!","I have never been more dissapointed with a second attempt. After indulging myself and emotions so thoroughly in The Notebook, I found this book as predictable as the fact that tomorrow will come after today. I could not put it down, however painful it was to see it to the end, always hoping that something of substance would happen. Nothing of any realistic substance ever did. After sending The Notebook to several of my friends, I will happily use this one for kindling."
2,It was like eating cotton-candy for breakfast.,"This book was such a disappointment. I was hoping that it was something that I could really sink my teeth into. But when I took a bite, it dissolved into nothing but a sicky-sweet taste in my mouth! The plot was cliche-ridden and predictable. Theresa and Garrett didn't even seem like real people! I kept hoping Jeb would meet someone like him (meaning a real person) and we could forget about these two cardboard cutouts. For someone who values honesty in relationships, I was appalled that the author based this book on deceitfulness and shared victim-hood!"
1,Total & Absolute Disappointment!,"Loved The Notebook, and HATED this one. I couldn't even stand to finish it ... I just skimmed the last couple of chapters and didn't miss much, even the end was predictable. I think Mr. Sparks is a One Hit Wonder."
1,"Dreadful, soggy, love story of a crying man.","Just check the story at wikipedia before reading this book. I wish I have done that before suffering the irreparable damage of reading those dreadful first pages. The narration is boring, concentrating only on the sorrow in the eyes of the protagonist and the hotness of the female protagonist. Hate it! If you are looking for a good romantic reading, this is not it."
2,This book was absolutely uninspiring!,"Sparks missed the boat on this one. It was an example of poor writing. He chose to treat readers as simple minded saps. He paid no attention to literary techniqes that may have made this a better story. The language was bland, dull; no color. It lacked descriptive details and the characters were static and undeveloped."
3,It was a different kind of love story.,"My mom told me to read it so I did. I thought it was a different kind of storyline, but neat. It was very romantic but,at times, predictable. And also very sad."
4,Emotionally-driven and his best yet!,"I have read both Nicholas Spark's books and this was his best yet. It is one that gives a ray of hope: you CAN indeed fall in love again. To me, the characters were credible- it's like I know these people. I felt for Garrett, tormented by demons of his beloved Catherine. I wrestled along with him. I understood Theresa's frustration of having to share him with Garrett's dead wife. I wait excitedly for his next novel!"
3,High hopes shattered.....,"Over all I enjoyed this book, I have read the Notebook, which was a beautiful lasting love story. This book, however left me feeling empty, I wasn't drawn closely enough to the characters to admire there depth of love or conviction towards one another. Something just didn't crab me to feel compassion for two lost souls. I hope one never lets money or success dictate one's true blessed gift of writting to allow to succomb to deadlines, wings of best sellers, I look forward to Nicholas's third book, I thank you for the Notebook, a work well praised and deserved."
1,This book was so boring . . .,"I finally gave it away . I tried and tried to read it, but the plot was so contrived and childish that I just couldn't care about the characters."
1,Couldn't finish reading it!,I was definitely disappointed by this one. The plot seemed to hold some promise until I found myself nauseous from the dialogue between these two characters. I found myself frustrated and annoyed by the (not very well-written) book as a whole. Why was this ever a bestseller? I just don't get it.
4,Love at first sight meets true love,"After having just finished NIcholas Sparks' second book, I have to say that he has an interesting way with words. Although at times the writing seemed juvenile, this made the book all the more interesting."
1,Sappy and Ridiculous,"Ugh - what an annoying book! My first Nicholas Sparks - this is my punishment for buying a book at the airport. Garret was so sappy - completely unrealistic and wholly unappealing. Theresa's character made no sense - she never thought he'd find out she wrote a column about him? DUH! The whole plot was just not well thought out. And the big surpise ""twist""? Come on, it was so obvious. I know there is a wide audience for silly romance novels, I just wished this book had been marked as such so I could have stayed away from it...."
2,Nicholas Sparks? or Barbara Cartland?,"Maybe I'm just jaded and bitter. Or maybe I read The Notebook when I was happy and in love. Either way, I was completely disappointed with Message in a Bottle. Too much boring detail (who cares what they were wearing, for God's sake) and too much sappy dialog. Is it impossible for two people to be in love in a normal way? Yes, people can learn to love again after losing the ""love of their life"" but usually it's a realistic relationship, not this storybook hoohah. I was ready for a relationship story, not an obvious attempt to jerk my heartstrings with a ""two-hanky"" romance. Mr. Sparks, write like you mean it, like you can. Don't pander to the folks who want goosh."
2,The neediest man I ever read about!,"Nicholas Sparks only succeeded in disappointing me with ""Message in a Bottle."" The plot was contrived and the characters were repulsive! If Sparks was attempting to create romantic and sensitive characters, he failed miserably with Garrett Blake. This sorrowful, broken-hearted character is supposed to be sensitive, but ends up as a seriously needy lump of a man who can't mend his shredded heart. Theresa Osborne on the other hand, his second true love, is overconfident to the point of being cocky and downright rude. For lovers of Sparks' ""The Notebook"" his latest work will leave you feeling empty and cheated. It's neither romantic nor touching, it's simply a 300 page treatise on the pitfalls of codependency."
3,Could have been better!!,"I had high hopes for this book after read in the Notebook and loving it. I thought Sparks would write about the same honest and natural true love, but I was disappointed by the debth of the book. Garrett and Theresa seemed to fall in love with the idealism of true love, but in the Notebook the theme of true love was naturally and realistically portrayed. I was looking for the same realism of ""true love"" in Message in the Bottle and did not discover it. The ending was too quick and contrive."
4,"Wonderful, I really enjoyed it.","I really enjoyed this novel. The beginning and the ending were fabulous. The middle was a little slow. I have also enjoyed ""The Notebook"". Great ideas and surprising storyline. I look forward to the movie."
1,Another one!,"Yet another novel that sat on the best seller lists forever and got a movie made with some of the best names in Hollywood. Unfortunately they had to rewrite the whole thing because the novel wasn't worth the paper it was written on. If you read The Bridges of Madison County or The Horse Whisperer, you've already read this shameless copycat. Don't bother reading it again."
3,Message in a Bottle Sinks,"I have not read ""The Notebook"" but if this book was any indication then I am not missing out. This idea behind it was unique and could have been a great love story...had someone else written it. Sparks continues to cheapen love and romance by sending the characters to bed almost as soon as they meet. Maybe this is a case where the movie will be better than the book."
5,The best book I have read in years.,"This is the book that I will never be without. From the moment I picked it up to the moment I threw away the tissues I could not put this book down. No Valentine, this is the perfect date."
5,I just couldn't put it down.,"I couldn't wait to get home from work so I could see what happened to Theresa and Garrett. This is definitely a tear-jerker. If you read Bridges of Madison County and cried, you haven't seen anything yet. You'll need a box of tissues handy. I've already recommended it to several friends."
1,What pap!,"This is the most mindless book I have ever read...I suppose if you like sappy soap opera's this one's for you.Personally, there are so many good books out there - you will do yourself a favor if you pass up this minipulative peice of junk..."
3,I truley enjoyed it BUT?,"Overall this was a fine read, however I felt it could have been a few chapters shorter due to the fact that the middle parts got boring very quickly. I wished that Jeb's character could have been expanded, and maybe introduced early on. I liked the bazarness of how they met, I know people who have met in more wild and co-dependent fashions. Overall Read It."
5,Fabulous book and recommended to everyone!,"This is a fabulous book that I would recommend to everyone. The author has a thorough grasp on both female and male thoughts, emotions, and reactions to romance. This enchanting novel is a page turner and a candidate for a kleenex box. Happy reading!"
2,give me a break . . .,"Upon reading this book, 4 words come to mind: cheesy, predictable and highly unlikely. The story is hard to believe, the characters are too melodramatic to empathize with and the entire concept is a bit far-fetched.However, if you are looking for an easy, quick read, this is the book for you since it doesn't require too much thinking. As corny as it is, it is still entertaining."
4,"Grab a glass of wine, a box of kleenex and enjoy!","OK, let's face it, this book is not Shakespeare, but, who says every book has to be! It's a very lovely book. It's extreamly easy reading. If you allow yourself remember that it isn't meant to be Shakespeare and let yourself look past some of the, admittedly, cheesy parts you may find a touching and entertaining book that will keep you hanging onto every word, anticipating what will happen next."
2,Slow and boring,"The plot was great, but after a while it got to be real slow and boring. It was a disappointment compared to Nicholas Sparks other books."
4,Must read!,"This was the first time I read a book by Nicholas Sparks. I thought he was an excellent writer, but I do have to say if you read the book do not watch the movie. I read the book first and was so disappointed in the movie. In my mind I had different images of the characters and the movie cut alot of important details out.I plan on reading more by Sparks and look forward to some of the same writing."
2,Message in a Bottle,I agree with Laura from California. There are only two books that I have read that are better in movie form...and this is one of them. The movie was more developed. The Notebook is one of my favorite books. This one though was too long for what happened. (I will add that I did see the movie first.)
1,tripe; an obvious outline for a screenplay,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of a saleslady in a bookstore. Bad decision! Poorly written (yesterday night?!), banal characterization and tear-jerking emotional manipulation are the features of this slight effort. No doubt Mr. Sparks had the screenrights pre-sold; no doubt he has (just) enough for a two-hour movie, but this really is a triumph of marketing over substance. Is his first one any better? If so, he should retire..the trends are not with him."
1,The preview is better,"I have to throw my hat into the ring. Overly simplistic, way way too predictable. Everything is so heavily foreshadowed, and badly written. Reading some parts was like listening to fingernails going against the chalkboard. Too bad the basic premise is so good."
3,Good until the end,"I thought this book was great at the beginning and could not put the book down. However, the ending was a surprise and disappointment. To fall in love and finally meet someone only for them to die was a waste of a good novel."
3,Try the postal service next time,"I found Message in a Bottle to be an easy read which was not quite believable. I think if Theresa loved Garret as much as she claimed she could have found a solution to bridge the miles between them. I thought it was really heartless of her letting the poor guy chase her in the car like that begging her to listen. Consequntly, my sympathy for her was a bit diluted in the end. As for that I found it almost laughable that Garrett would risk life and limb simply to through a bottle in the ocean to a dead woman he wants to put behind him.Think about it he could have gone the normal route and used the postal service."
1,Ba-land,"Oh boy...I was ready for a heartwarming tearjerker of a novel. I haven't read a book this bland and boring in ages. The letters were pretty...but the dialogue..yikes! For those searching for some delicious reading try something by Willa Cather...""My Antonia""or ""One of Ours""..or Amy Tan's ""The Kitchen God's Wife"" or Emile Zola's ""Therese Raquin""..."
1,"Banal, insipid, cliched, farfetched, plagiaristic","This book deserves no stars at all. Not only is it poorly written, hackneyed and trite, but the final letter of the book rips off (using some of the same language) A Civil War letter written by Sullivan Ballou before he died at the Battle of Bull Run. Now, THAT was a beautiful piece of writing. I'm outraged that someone who calls himself a writer can plagiarize so brazenly from what is now a well-known letter, thanks to Ken Burn's PBS ""The Civil War."" If you don't believe me, look it up."
1,Waste of Money and Time!,"Let's get a ""zero star rating"" setup - this book deserves it!! How on earth does this fellow Nicholas Sparks become so popular??? The best bits in this otherwise atrocious book were the letters Garrett wrote to Catherine (why did I get the feeling that there was an eerie connection with ""Wuthering Heights"", albeit ""schlockized"" and dumbed down for the 21st century???). Thank heaven I saved the receipt for this one! First read the review by the ""official"" reviewers, THEN decide if you really want to waste your time and money on this drivel."
1,Hysterically funny!,"This goes almost to the very top of my list of the 10 worst books ever written! But it is SO bad that it becomes quite funny, so I would therefore recommend it as a comedy...of sorts.I lost track of how many times Garret ""collected his thoughts"" and Theresa ""replied coyly""--dozens surely. Did Sparks hire a neighbor child of 10 to ghost write for him? I ended up wanting to shoot both of them and put them out of their misery--Garret, you wimp, get a life! Theresa, you conniving manipulator, leave him alone!I have a box of tissues, unopened, if anyone thinks they'll need it."
2,How could he get away with this?!?,"I didn't want to judge this novel too harshly, but then I read Sparks' first novel and was aghast at how he rehased so much of it into this one. It was the worst deja vu to read almost whole paragraphs reused in similar scenes, word for word. Although I read The Notebook second, I enjoyed it more than this book which seemed formulaic in the most embarrassing way for a 2nd bestselling novel."
3,Enjoyable read,"As did many other people, I bought this book because The Notebook was so perfectly written. Message in a Bottle is an o.k. read; I stayed interested from beginning to end. But, I had difficulties with perspective shifts from one paragragh to the next and truly found the ending hard to believe. Someone as smart as Garrett Blake seemed to be would not do what he did. The characters were fairly well drawn, I could picture them in my head easily enough. Too predictable at the beginning and too far out at the end. I admit, I did shed a few tears while reading the last letter, but it's not a book I'll plan on visiting again as I do The Notebook."
5,Another masterpiece,"This is another excellent book by Mr. Sparks. I had the same reaction this time. he is slowly becoming my favorite author. Yet again I will be passing this along to my best friends. I was good this time and I didn't let myself cry until the last few pages (mainly because my boyfriend was in the room and I wouldn't have been able to live it down. If you liked his first book, definitely get this one. If you haven't read either of them, run out and get them now!!"
3,Not even close,I was so disappointed at the lack of passion and depth in this novel compared to the Notebook (which I absolutely loved and cried over). It was predictable and unbelievable (who really dreams each night about what they want to dream about). The last 20 pages were the only saving grace.
1,disappointing,"I really enjoyed ""The Notebook"" and thought I had found with Sparks a new favourite author. But the ""Message"" was a waste of time: the story seems unbelieveable to me, the characters are so unpleasant that I could not identify me with them. I did not like the whole story."
2,A Halfway Good Book,"Though I though Garret was a major weeny, and needed to grow up, I continued to the end hoping for a mature resolution. The book kept me feeling that it could only get better. After the ending I was enraged. Not only was it an unhappy ending, but it was so incredibly sappy. I felt so cheated and if it had not been the property of the library I would have run it over. Thank goodness I did not waste money on this book."
5,Grips the Heart,"I live about 45 mins. south of Wilmington, NC and felt right at home while reading Message in a Bottle. I lost my 22 year old brother resently and he was also a lover of the great Atlantic Ocean. He would go on the ocean for days to fish, and just enjoy the great wonders of the sea. I could not stop comparing my brother with Garrett. The tears came early in the story for me and did not stop until well after the book was finished. If you have ever loved and lost, take the time to get to know Theresa and Garrett."
1,"Loved ""Notebook""! ""Message"" total disappointment!","""Notebook"" was refreshing. It touched the heart and soul. Whoever I recommended this book to just loved it. Having read such a wonderful book by Sparks, I was anxious to get my hands on his ""Message"" even paying full price. I felt it would be worth every dollar I spent if it was anything like ""Notebook"". It wasn't!!! It was a total disappointment. The characters were bland and immature...they lacked real communication skills...the whole story line just too unrealistic and boring. Sorry folks! Thumbs down on this one."
4,Great Read for a Rainy Day,"This was my first reading of a Nicholas Sparks' work of literature. What a different and exciting treat. The book flows nicely through the storyline and one becomes involved with and feels empathy for all the characters that we learn about. As was to be expected I found myself crying at the end of the book, but felt a small life lesson had been learned and appreciated in the entire process. I have since passed this book on to many of my family, friends, and co-workers, and also find myself giving it as a gift. A great book. Reads quickly, and one to keep in your collection to reread on a whim."
3,"Almost as good as ""The Notebook""","The story was fascinating and it definitely aroused my interest, but as I excitedly read the pages, I was disappointed at the end of the novel. The best part was when he had the dream and she told him that it was her who directed the bottle..."
1,I can't believe I wasted three evenings reading this book!,As I read Message In a Bottle I asked myself the following questions: Isn't this story similar to the movie Sleepless in Seattle? Didn't I quit reading Danielle Steele books five years ago? Is this the script to a TV movie? I found Sparks' writing to be trite and mundane. The story was predictable and much too long.
2,Not impressive...,"I thought that the quality of writing in this novel was quite poor. The storyline was filled with clichés..it wasn't a novel that made you think, really. It kept my attention long enough to finish it, but I wouldn't reccommend it to my friends."
3,Pretty Good Read Until The Last Couple Of Chapters!,"This story had potential. It's not that the book is bad, (I really liked most of it) it's just that the ending took the wind out of my sail (no pun intended). I was actually mad when I got done reading. I was hoping that it would end up like a ""Sleepless in Seattle"" story, where against the odds, they would find happiness together. Boy was I wrong. Stock up on kleenex!"
3,Good book until the end!,"I loved the The Notebook, even the ending. And I loved Message in a Bottle till I got to the end. Nicholas Sparks wrote a beautiful love story and then broke my heart so much so that it really ruined the story for me. We like happy endings, Mr. Sparks!"
2,NO SPARKS THIS TIME!,"Simply loved THE NOTEBOOK and couldn't wait to read this one. Not even close! This one was too easy to figure out, I knew what was going to happen at every turn of the page, too many clues, to little surprize. THE NOTEBOOK was such a loving, tender story that it actually made my husband cry when he read it to me. Not this one! Not even one snif! It's too bad they have decided to make a movie out of this and not THE NOTEBOOK, that one would have made history, but this one, it's just collecting dust!"
1,This book was not worth the paper it's printed on!,"I thought that this book was poorly written, unbelievable, and that the characters were under developed. It was recommended to me by a relative so I rushed out and got it the next day. I won't even tell her I read it because I'd be embarassed to tell her what I thought of it.I am a 35 year old woman who thought that the dialogue was ridiculous, the characters childish and immature, and the plot totally unbelievable. I didn't even cry at the end; it was so predictable (and overdone)! I bought this book in hardback and now wish I'd have saved the money to go see the movie, which, for once, looks more promising than the book!"
1,Somebody please kill me with a brick.,"Oh, dear God, the melodrama. The story was interesting until Sparks gets the main characters together, and then the story degenerates into what other readers have (accurately) describe as a soppy mess. Hearing this on NPR may put me off Radio Reader for good. I don't know how Dick Estelle can read this without cracking up."
1,Can't believe it is the same author as The Notebook,"After reading The Notebook, I was excited to pick up another hyped Nicolas Sparks book. But boy oh boy was it such a let-down. A third of the way through I started rolling my eyes. When I was half way though, I found that I didn't really care about the two characters and how their ""relationship"" would become. Three quarter through, I was hoping for one of them to die (how horrible was that!?). I just wish it was Theresa who died. She was a creepy stalker who jumped into bed with a practical stranger. And she ""forgave"" him for what he had done!? She was the one who needed to ask for forgiveness for publishing other people's private thoughts and looking him up and stalking him."
2,Harlequin Presents...Nicholas Sparks,"While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.I'm extremely surprised this is a ""best seller"". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear."
1,A boring and very predictable book,Yawn! After reading this book my main thought was that I could write as well. Save your money.
1,"Oh, please!","This was my introduction to Nicholas Sparks as a writer, and a sorry introduction it was. (I haven't purchased another of his books, though I did see the movie of The Notebook, which I thought was a wonderful story and and film.) But it's hard to believe a writer who could produce something as awful as Message in a Bottle, could write beautiful books too.Message in A Bottle was everything bad -- a stupid, maudlin soap opera with a dumb ending. The characters were cardboard, the drama never got off the ground. The writing was as amateurish as it gets. The dialogue was inane. I thought I was reading the exercise of a first-time writer in junior high school. The only reason this book made it was that the author was already a ""New York Times Bestselling Author"". Just proves that the world of publishing is completely irrational and unfair."
1,Only for those who want to be manipulated...,"This was so dreary and pointless. There is very little originality here; I kept thinking that Mr. Sparks ""borrowed"" from countless other stories. The part where she is looking for background on the ""mysterious"" author of these letters is right out of Sleepless in SeattleThe suspense is non-existent. One reason I kept reading was to see if i had accurately read the heavy foreshadowing.A trademark of Sparks seems to be that he manipulates his readers (ala Tuesdays w/ Morrie""). I just didn't care about this soogy love story.Save your money and purchase a book with substance. I recommend Coming Home by R. Pilcher."
1,Dumb and predictable,The writing is wooden and cliche-ridden and the story is so predictable that a 10 year old could guess what will happen next. I forced myself to finish it in preparation for seeing the movie (just because it was filmed in my state)and I am a fan of Paul Newman. The movie HAS to be better than this!
4,Loved it!!,"Loved it but, wish it would have ended different. It was just too tragic, hope the movie has a happier ending!"
3,"This is a quick, easy book to read.",This was a good book but by no means would I recommend this title as a great book. To me this was just a book that was neither great nor awful. It was somewhere in the middle of the road.
3,Entertaining,"While most of the readers seem to either really love or hate this book, I am somewhere in between. While I recognize this is not great literature, I think it can be a lot of fun if you just relax and read it for what it's worth. I found it entertaining which is the main reason I love to read! Thanks to the reader who recommended FRIED CALAMARI. I loved it."
2,Tear Jerker?,"Although this book was an easy read and kept me reading, I did not find it to be a romantic tear jerker. It was full of all too perfect love scenes. I didn't feel as if the characters really knew each other and it felt like an immature love story until the end. The ending of the book almost made it worthwhile and it did surprise me, but the first three quarters of the book sometimes annoyed me. Maybe I'm just not a romantic, but I've cried for more realistic love stories. I didn't think the Notebook was that great either. Am I just missing something? I don't think I'll watch the movie."
3,"Predictable, no brainer",This book was meant to be a movie not an inspiring novel. I was disappointed by it's predictability.
1,"Return to Sender, ASAP!!!","I recently read ""The Notebook"",and I didn't think it was great literature. However, I liked it because it was a touching and heartfelt novel. ""Message In a Bottle"" is a different story altogether. I'm almost finished with it, and I have to say that this book is a total dissapointment. The plot is too long, too farfetched, and totaly boring. Don't waste your money or time on this stinker."
1,PEPSI-LIGHT WITH A MANIPULATIVE AFTER-TASTE,"Premise predictable with characters of little depth. Would not have finished if movie was not coming out, and believed there must be more to the book to even warrant a movie. Still worth seeing Costner...Paul Newman is perfectly cast as the father role"
1,The epidemy of TRITE,"'Message in a Bottle' has not one original thought, sentence, scene or idea. I'm amazed that anyone fell for the transparent and light-weight sentimentality of this book. Every passage ispredictable and all the characters are flat and unreal.I wished I could find one redeeming quality. This was by far the most amateur and trite love story I've read in years.Sorry, Mr. Sparks. You missed the mark in a big way."
1,Waste of time!,This story could have been a short story in a magazine and it might have been worth spending a half hour or so reading. Thank goodness I didn't spend any of my money on it! I thought the same thing about Bridges of Madison County. I can't believe so many people think this stuff is good.
1,More painful than the Marx-Engel Reader,"I'm only through the first part of this book and I hate it. It should have gone through at least two re-writes before it was published. The prose is hackneyed, and lacks any lyrical quality whatsoever. Why is Sparks so intent upon explaining useless details, i.e. what Theresa wore to go shopping, or the size of her breasts??!! Obviously the author meant this book to be a screenplay."
1,This story has no plot...,"I have been reading over 200 pages - still looking for the plot, or the meaning to this book. So far it is just boring dialog, romance, and --- whatever. I read some of the reviews and I suppose Garrett gets killed later on. Wish they had bumped him off earlier - maybe the book would have been shorter..."
5,The book was perpetually touching,Nicholas Sparks has an unbelievable ability. It's hard to imagine that it was his second novel. He portrays characters so adeptly. I got to know Theresa and Garrett as if they were my friends. The book is superb.
2,Well...,"I loved this book at the begining because there was a semi-normal realationship going on, but then, as time went on I developed a real dislike to Garret, the fact that he couldn't get over his wife was sweet at the begining, but then after a while it just got annoying, like he couldn't decide between an alive woman that he loved and his dead wife that he also loved. It really isn't that hard of a decision, it's not like he would have a great realationship with his wife- she's dead. And then towards the end of the gook I got the feeling that he was selfish, I won't say why because it may ruin the ending for some people. If you've been told this was a great book and to read it, I suggest that you rent it from the library, because, like many other people, I went in with Great Expectatins and came out with Great Disappointments."
1,What a waste of time,This was obviously written as a screen play first and then Sparks tried to make it into a novel. He failed. He cannot write dialogue to save his soul and the whole story line is such a cliche! I think this is one case where I may actually like the movie better than the book.
1,I can't believe this book made it to print,"I don't know how anyone can put this book and the ""Bridges of Madison County"" in the same class. Gag me.Once again, we have to suffer with a heroine who is too gorgeous to be real (don't forget the great hair and flat stomach), who is romantically mentored by an older woman (always overweight and asexual). In comes the mystery man (who is also drop-dead gorgeous), who is haunted by his last love. Haven't we read a book like this before? Fortunately, Mr Sparks writes enough about the beautiful NC coastline to spark any interest in this syrup-laden, predictable book."
1,Tedious and predictable.,"I love a good romance if it is well written and has an intriguing plot and fine character development. No, no, no. I was trapped on a long flight with nothing but this book. Nevertheless, I finished the book once home so it earned one star."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. I confess, I didn't even read the whole thing. About halfway through I got tired of wincing and just scan/read to see how it ended. Poorly. How could this guy be a best selling author?"
2,Way too Depressing!!! Don't waste your time!,"I found this book to be a quick read and kept me up late reading. I was very disappointed in this book especially after reading The Notebook (more realistic, maybe because it was told from the male point of view). You can tell a man wrote this book!! Nicholas should not tell stories from a female point of view. For someone like Theresa who couldn't get enough time off of work in the beginning of the book she ends up with a very flexible schedule and very LARGE pocketbook. Good career or not, I don't know any single mothers that can afford that much air travel and time off from work. The ending would never happen with an experienced seaman as Garrett was, hell I wouldn't do that!! This book insults our intelligence with the unrealistic chain of events. A love story isn't suppose to make you cry with saddness but cry with happiness!"
1,As boring as a golf tournament on the radio...,"I haven't read ""The Notebook"" and now I won't because this book is such a bomb. The characters are soooo boring and under-developed, the dialog is horrid. It is similar to the only Danielle Steele book I've read, except Sparks at least did not have incomplete sentences as Steele does. Hopefully, this is not to be the popular trend of bestsellers, TRASH LITERATURE."
2,A shallow attempt at a love story!,"I read ""The Notebook"" and thoroughly enjoyed the ""realness"" of the characters, the tenderness they shared and the undulation of the story. With this in my memory, I picked up a copy of ""Message"" and started reading. By the time I was 50 pages in, I was disappointed. Theresa is a successful woman who is portrayed as a suffering soul. Despite her loneliness and her supposed sensitivity, she conducts herself in a manipulative manner! Garrett is too absorbed in his loss. Catherine's pregnancy came as NO suprise! The only real person in the book seems to be Deanna! About halfway through this read, I was HOPING for an unfulfilling ending for Theresa. I felt no empathy, spilled no tears. Mr. Sparks has already demonstrated that he can write with eloquence and tenderness, but he must take time to develop characters with whom we can relate. I, for one, can't believe that Hollywood is taking this sappy book and making a movie! Ugh!"
1,Message sunk in a bottle,"Trite!!! Boring!!! Lacks ANY emotional depth, meaningful characterization or significant plot line. Obvious from the first page. Juvenile. Silly!!! Wish I had gotten anything else but my book club made me read it."
1,Don't waste money on the book or the movie,"This book should have been a step up from Sparks' first novel, The Notebook, where he combined amateur prose with a simplistically beautiful love story. However, Message in a Bottle lacked The Notebook's ring of truth and the writing was more uneven. It seemed as if Sparks couldn't quite convince himself that the hero could have a true love other than his ""Catherine"" (also the name of Sparks' wife). The book should have been character-centered, but instead Sparks forced his characters into unbelievable situations. As for the movie, a dead fish could have brought more life to the role than Kevin Costner."
3,"Good story, but not as moving as The Notebook","Message in a Bottle held my attention fully, while proving itself to be highly entertaining. However, I read it thinking it was going to be a true heartwarming love story, as was the Notebook. By comparison, I would have to say it was superficial. The Notebook struck me as an example of classic literature, involving characters with real, honest depth and dignity. Message in a Bottle was more along the lines of a romance novel."
4,Very touching and romantic,"I saw the movie first, and am currently almost done with the book. Although many differences between the movie & book, I am enjoying the book very much. Garrett's love for Catherine is truly inspiring, as is the beautiful relationship between Garrett & Theresa. I am compelled to read ""The Notebook"" next. Good job Nicholas!"
5,Two people have a chance meeting and fall in love.,Message In A Bottle was the finest love story Ive read in years. The story is about a woman who finds a bottle on the beach and what's inside causes changes for two people who are very lonely. There is a letter in the bottle written by a man whose wife has died and cant seem to experience love again. The woman who finds the message tracks down the man and they fall madly in love. They are both different and cant seem to change their ways. Due to that they part and the story ends in a sad way for both.
1,So bad I couldn't even finish it!,"I tried, I really did! For the masses who thought that ""Love Story"" was great writing. At least I won't waste any money seeing the movie.There are so many wonderful books out there that it astounds me that a book like ""Message"" is considered ""great."""
1,I hated the ending!,"I did not enjoy the book. You anticipate the ending of the book, and the end of this one was not worth the anticipation!"
5,I liked it........,"I liked this book good, and easy reading. I will say if you've seen the film your missing a lot of things. I won't mention all but I highly suggest you read the book. So I will say you'll like this..."
4,raw grief,"I read this book, and felt the raw grief of the character. I was widowed at 22, left with a 7 month old son, and a broken heart. The grief was acurately described and would be a good book for anyone to read who has a friend whom is grieving. It will help you glimse into the sadness. I thought many times as I read, ""I felt that..."" And yes, when the right time arrives, there is a re-awakening to joy, and new-found love.."
5,Message In A Bottle,Excellent book. I truly enjoyed reading this and many of the Nicholas Sparks books. They keep my attention and make me want to read on to find out what happens.
2,Emotional yet unrelatable,"This is the second novel i ready by Nicholas Sparks that i did not enjoy. It seems his writing style does not appeal to me. Certain scenes are described in such detail which hardly seems necessary, it felt like reading a deposition where every single mindless detail is recorded. Perhaps some things are better left out and the reader can make his own connections.The book itself was very easy to read, but very predictable and lacked excitement. Every event was anticipated and the ending was sad yet not memorable. Although this love story is fiction I didn't find myself rooting for either character. They were both annoying with issues and ideals so out of touch with the modern world.You can without a doubt skip this book."
3,"Charming, but certainly not Sparks' best work...","For those of us who have suffered a painful end to a long-term relationship and wonder if fate will allow us that second chance to find another person with whom we can share our lives, 'Message in a Bottle' attempts to provide readers with just such an idea that there is always a reason to hope. Unfortunately, Nicholas Sparks set the bar quite high with 'The Notebook,' and I consequently found 'Message in a Bottle' to be a bit too predictable, melodramatic, and full of cliches. While I wouldn't necessarily advise potential readers not to pick up this book, I would suggest taking a look at some of Sparks' other works instead."
2,How to write a bestseller,"If I was not so sentimental, I would have given this one star, but it did raise a tear to my eye in spite of myself.All the traditional elements of a weepy bestseller, clichéed characters, predictable story, absolutely programmed to appeal to a certain type of reader who does not want to be challenged with anything new, but hopes to find in a book a permutation of familiar themes, culminating in a watery message about the meaning of life. I felt faintly queasy after reading it, as though I had eaten too much candy floss.Disappointing, but I had not read his first book. Come to think of ot, I don't think I will either."
3,Nice Story,This was a nice story but was a bit disappointing. Very predictable and somewhat unrealistic.
5,"Wonderful Delightful Book, don't see the movie!","I loved this haunting romantic story, the characters pull you in to the core of their lives, and it was hard to put the book down. If you love the story of romance,this undying love story from start to end will be a delight to you. Have tissues ready! Warning! Do not expect the movie to be a carbon copy of the book! The movie of same title, changes the whole story,only thing common is the characters names! I saw no similaritys between the book. I was very disappointed in Costners wimpy performance, of Garret, in this character is romantic, witty, and charming. I don't know how the author agreed to have this movie made!"
2,Not a book for literary enthusiasts,"Although this book may be satisfying to romance genre readers, for those of us with any literary inclination this book is a horror. The third person narrative is too cliche and annoying. There are over a dozen instances of ""she"" and ""she'd"" in a paragraph on page 2. The story line is nice and if you can get past the style and like the premise, it's worth the read."
5,Recommed completely,"I have enjoyed this book completely. I was really surprised of this ending, it was sad and enlighting. I have been very happy with Nicolas Sparks books. I have read most of them, and come back satisfied after reading them."
1,Moderately entertaining- but barely worth your time,"Perhaps I was so disappointed with ""Message in a Bottle"" because I had just read ""Angela's Ashes"" - a truly heart-wrenching story. I found Nicholas Sparks' writing poor and the story line trite - lonely divorcee finds a message in a bottle from a lonely widower, who she then hunts down? Okay, maybe, but the plot goes WAY downhill from there. As for the ending, anyone who didn't see it coming obviously was too caught up in the romance to see this book for what it truly is - a daytime soap opera during sweeps week. That may be fine for someone looking to kill a few hours, but if you're interested in literature, look elsewhere."
3,Went shopping for groceries and came home with a book...,"A female reader who hates romance novels, I picked this book up at the market after paging through it while waiting in the check-out line. Heard the book was going to be made into a movie starring Kevin Costner. I read the summary of the plot, it sounded interesting so I tossed the book in the cart. The story line at the beginning was so predictable and the letters the female charactor found were mushy filled with alot dramatic overkill: just the very reasons why I hate romance novels! At this point, I was relieved I only opted for the cheaper paperback version of the book instead of spending the big bucks on a hard copy. Although I was tempted to just skip ahead and read the ending, I didn't. The ending was a complete surprise, and not at all like what I thought would happen. Since I finished the book, my copy has been circulating around the office and several family members have read it as well. Quite a popular book."
3,"Too unrealistically romantic, real life is tougher than this",This story is very beautiful. But in a sense too beautiful and romantic to be realistic. The charaters are one sided and simple in heart and mind. Therefore his death at the end feels too abrupt. However this pure story might be a refinment to the dry hearts of the modern people.
2,"See the movie, skip the book.","I didn't think it could be done... This is the first time I have ever found a movie to be better than the book. If I had read the book first, I never would have bothered seeing the movie. The movie is a love story that left me in tears. I shed no tears when reading the book. I wasn't convinced they were in love. The impression was more that they were both lonely and needed some nookie. I say three cheers for the screenwriter who took a so-so story and masterfully improved on it."
5,A heart warming (and crushing) romance,"This was the most incredible novel I have ever said. I cried my eyes out over the enchanting love story portrayed. Others with whom I shared the book told me they thought it was very predictable, and consequently not a tear-jerker. I don't understand how the romance was predictable- the story kept me on the edge the whole way through (which, by the way, only took a day because I couldn't put it down!). A great read, much better than the movie."
2,Flat and contrived,"The story had a lot of potential, but the characters were not developed and the plot was contrived. Thoughts and emotions were described in ""5 words or less"", jumping forward, skipping the ""meat"". I was disappointed with this ""bestseller"". For excellent writing, try ""One True Thing"" by Anna Quindlen. She knows how to tell a story and put you in the shoes of characters."
4,Pleasantly surprised how quickly I was drawn into the book.,"It was great to find a book that completely took me away to another place while I was reading. The book read easily, was romantic and certainly had a different ending than I anticipated. Found myself teary-eyed at the end of the book and left with a warm feeling."
2,One Big Disappointment,"After reading The Notebook, I was really looking forward to reading Message in a Bottle...I thought for sure it would be as good, if not better, but was I ever wrong. I received the audio book as a gift, so I decided to try that out instead of reading the book. Maybe that was my first mistake. I listened to it straight through, and I didn't shed a single tear. The story just wasn't filled with the emotions that The Notebook had. I was hoping for something at least a little uplifting...this story doesn't hold a candle to Sparks' first novel. Maybe it is better when you read it for yourself. At any rate, I don't recommend the audio version."
4,"Not wonderful literature, but a great read","I am so surprised at the mixed reviews. For every review of someone saying is was the best book they ever read, there is another saying it is complete garbage. Amazing.I thought this was a good story. It was a little predictable, not terribly imaginative writing, and a little dull in parts, but a good read altogether. I found it easy to continue, wondering what would happen next, not anticipating the ending, and touched by the characters. Again, no literature awards, but a good story. GREAT BEACH BOOK!!!"
2,sad story,"The story was was a quick and easy read (finished it on a sunday afternoon with plenty of time for chores,etc!) but The plot was VERY far fetched, character development flat, and the ending was absurd, manipulative, and in my opinion cheapened the story and made it seem pointless.if you want to read a book, just to feel sad, and not much else, then this is the novel for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a well written story that you can learn from, then look elsewhere."
5,MESSAGE TO THE HEART From Message in a Bottle!,"Nicholas Sparks clearly is a young man with an OLD Soul. This book takes you into the hearts and souls of two people very much in Love. Two people that had always loved each other. They are Soul Mates with a destiny. I will now, and forever be looking for the ""Message in a Bottle"". Thank You Nicholas for the EXCELLENT book. I purposely waited for just the right moment to finish this wonderful Love story. I may have to read it again....Thank You, Rosi Bentley"
5,A different kind of love story,"I read The Notebook and wanted more. This is certainly what I was looking for. Theresa and Garrett may seem to be from two different worlds but their underlying passion for ""the right one"" comes along at just the right time. Yeah, sure, the message in a bottle sounds a bit corny, but once you get through the search for the author of the messages you'll not be able to put the book down. N. Sparks please continue your splendid writing with such quiet passion! It was a great summer beach read!"
1,The bottle should have broke - or sunk with it's protagonist,"Another bomb from Nick Sparks. I've explained the basic premise to about a dozen people, and every one of them has guessed the plot to a ""T"". The ""messages"" that the main character finds are the most contrived, embarrasingly stupid pieces of pulp mush I have ever had the displeasure of reading. There wasn't a page I read that wasn't predictable for it's outcome. There was never any sense of mystery about whether the two main characters would meet and fall in love. It boiled down to an argument of who was going to move in with who, and THAT's why they ""broke up"". I encourage everyone to read this book, just because it's so laughably bad. Or just read the Weekly World News, at least there is a sence of drama in it's pages...."
1,Don't waste your time,"If you like sappy, corny, love stories, based on just two characters who are really not all that interesting or likable....Then you will enjoy this book. I had the audio version with Kathleen Quinlan and Bruce Boxleitner as narrators. Bruce's southern accent was pretty fake and kept distracting me. Kathleen's narration was lacking warmth and failed to draw me into the story. But considering the material they had to work with...you can't really fault them."
2,great in the beginning...,"Well I loved ""The Notebook"" so i thought that I'd give this a try. It was a great book up until the last 20 pages, when it just took a rather obvious turn that didn't need to happen. Stupid what she did then what he did was even more moronic. If you love someone don't wait to find them, just go and find them. dumb dumb dumb ending that ruined the whole book."
2,"Boring, sappy, and slow-moving","I was stuck with this book on an airplane flight and read the whole thing in an hour and a half, skimming through the boring parts, which were most of the book. There were tons of excruciating, slow conversations and other boring-beyond-belief stuff. I had to stop and read the instructions on the airplane barf bag every once in a while just to stay awake."
4,DON'T EVEN START UNLESS YOU ARE UP TO CRYING ALL NIGHT!!!!!,I read The Notebook and found it to be just like this one. His books have great love stories and page turning writing and but terrible endings. His writing skill of pulling you from one long chapter to another is wonderful. I was up until 1:00am both nights reading and found that the only place to stop is in the middle of his chapters because he builds up right at the end and makes you start the next chapter to see what is happening. BUT.... the end of the book was absolutely the worst!!!!! I cried the last hour that I read and woke up with swollen eyes the next day. Just way too depressing for me!! I don't think that I'll ever read any more of his books if they all end so depressing. My life is despressing enough I don't need to be reading some think that makes me drag for days after I read it.
4,"Almost as good as ""The Notebook""","This is a page turner, modern romance, and a mystery. The story itself is good with an original beginning, but it is the ending that makes it exceptional. Most of the time we hope for a happy ending, but this ironic ending with a lesson learned is exquisite. Overall, I enjoyed ""The Notebook"" more, but they are different types of stories."
3,The characters were difficult to care about,"A good love story needs a message and fully developed characters. I liked the message of this book (eternal love and growth), but I didnt' really care about the characters. Garrett was an out of touch, dependent idealist and I definitely did not like him. (Costner will do a good job with him, though.) Theresa was a bit more magnetic, but she's ultimately shallow. (And I really can't think of an actress who would make a good Theresa...well, OK, let's recreate Bull Durham and go with Susan Sarandon, though both of them are really too old for these parts.) I liked this easy love story...sped through the thing in a couple of days...with very little tension in the plot, except for a smattering of conflict toward the end...but by then you just wanted to get through it and move on to something else. END"
1,"What a sappy,poorly written waste of time",I was so angry with myself for spending time with this (paperback)book that I threw it away....an act akin to book burning
1,manipulative junk,"I know this is an online book review but I thought maybe those of you who read the book might like to hear an opinion on the movie also. I love a good romance especially when I can share it with my wife, but manipulative ""hollywood"" trash like this just makes me angry. If you can't move your audience emotionally with good writing (script or novel) without killing off one of the main characters just for the sake of a good ""tear-jerking"" then you have no business writing period. The movie itself was better than the book but the ending left you thinking ""What was the point?"" Why would anyone lead it's audience on a journey about the triumph of love and overcoming pain and sorrow of a lost loved one only to kill them in the end? Manipulative and just plain stupid."
2,"IF this was my first Sparks book, it would have been my last!","People must be starved for romance. That's the only reason I can see people would give this book 5 stars. Or, possibly it was assummed it must be good because of previous Sparks books. I wanted to like it. The plot had great possibilities. Sparks just did not write in the same style as his other books. All of his books I have read (Notebook, Wedding, A Walk to Remember) kept me glued to the page and even had me wanting to just start the book immediately over again when I finished. This one was an effort to get through. The dialogue was probably better on the screen where you can see the expressions and body language. On the written page, it was trite and embarrassing. The characters seemed one-dimensional."
2,Too Sappy,"The ""not so happily ever after"" ending could not keep this novel from being too sappy, too predictable, & too long. This whole story could have been told in about 30 pages. I never even remotely felt a connection with the the settings and I've been to Wilmington many times. The Notebook by this author is a better choice."
1,In a word...YAWN.,"Don't bother. Flat. Boring. Predicatable. One dimensional characters at best. I don't know why he didn't just write a screenplay. This overwrought, pathetic excuse for a drama was obviously penned with big screen dollar signs in mind. Rarely have I been so disappointed in a book."
3,The Notebook was Better,"I loved the Notebook and looked forward to this novel. I felt disappointed at the ending as the story just seemed to fall apart. The characters were good, the setting authentic but the story seemed flat."
3,The Notebook was better,"The love story was interesting, but it didn't have to drag so long in the middle. The characters annoyed me, and could have definitely been created better. The ending was bad, but I was glad that at least something happened. The ending made me cry a lot, though. Still, Message in a Bottle is a heart-warming book, but it's nothing compared to the Notebook. I don't know why they are making a movie on this one instead. I will, however, definitely see themovie because I think this storyline is better suited for the screen than a book."
1,"So boring, so predictable!","My title says it: boring and predictable, and UNREALISTIC. I can't believe i paid that much money for this crap. Now I feel better."
4,This is a quick read that keeps your attention.,"I really enjoyed this book because I was vacationing in Florida and read it on the beach. I was tempted to throw a bottle with a message in the Atlantic. I usually don't go for depressing stories, but this one was enjoyable because of the characters and theme. It even convinced me to read the Notebook which I had avoided because of listening to everyone who had read it and cried through it. Don't miss this one! Read it today."
1,This is the worst book I've read in along time.,"This is the worst book I've read in along time. This is worse than Danelle Steele, althought I've never been a great fan of hers, either. The characters in this book were all very weak and contrived. Pathetic describes it very well. The plot was even worse. Finding Garrett in only in matter of hours??? It also never occurred to Theresa to tell Garrett of her ""little secret""?? I have no idea what either character saw in each other. They lived in totally different worlds. I can go on and on why I hated this book. Give me some likeable, respectable characters and a plot with some connection to reality!"
4,Second only to The Notebook!,Sparks did a great job with his follow-up to The Notebook. This is a man that can really express his feelings and are felt so deeply that you are emotionally drained when you finish the book. I cna only find one fault and that is that I need to allow time between Sparks' books due to the endings. They really get to me and I'll talk about them for days after.
2,Another cliche waste of time,"I read MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE thinking, ""I hate romances, but how bad can it be? Oprah recommended his other book..."" This was a story of a manipulitive woman who searches for the man she has found letters from washed upon the shore. Sparks seems to side at times with this sneaky creature, making her seem ""right"" at most parts in the novel. I could not take that. The unrealistic part of this novel was that Theresa went all the way to North Carolina to find this mystery man, finds him, and of course they instantly fall in love. This book takes too much patience on the behalf of the reader, from the anything-but-unique love letters, to the frail plot in between, to the cliche, spur-of-the-moment ending. Don't waste your time."
1,Completely overrated book,"I found this book to be pretty poorly written. The plot was so predictable. Neither of the main characters were particularly interesting either, especially ""Garrett"". In fact, he really bugged me. I did not think of him as being some attractive and mysterious man, but a wimpy and childish man. And did anyone else notice how overused the characters' names were? I think the word Garrett was in every sentence. I only finished it because I was on a long plane ride and had no other alternative. I also have no desire to see the movie."
5,A selfish and self centered society can not value this book,"Yes l read and l cried too. l am glad to know that the feelings, to care someone other than your self, romance, to know that simple, little things have more meanings and have more value then the rich ones..... is still around and not long forgotten. Thank you Nicholas."
1,Preditable.! Just wanted to finish it to put it behind me!,"I could have written a better book, and I'm no writer. I felt as though there was nothing to look forward to.. The only surprising part of this book was the ending, and even that was written in a mediocre way!"
5,A Toching Book That Makes you cry,"What can I say? It is truely a terrific book. The ending was heartbreaking though. It seems that both of them are meant to be together but somehow, it is just not meant to be. Read that book. It is a great book and it seems like it has been a looongg time that any book touches me the way this book did."
5,This could be the author to end all!!!,"What a book, well written, deep, moving, a must for a dream. She was exceptional.Could not put down, and i was disapoinnted in her first"
1,"The worst since ""Bridges of Madison County""","Formulaic, patronizing and dull. I'm just glad it was loaned to me, and that I didn't waste my money, just my time. The last time I read something this poorly written, it was ""The Bridges of Madison County"". If you liked that level of writing, you'll love this."
1,Wake Me When It's Over,"This is the most boring book I've ever read. The plot is so unlikely I can't suspend my disbelief. The reader wishes everyone in the book would just drown. The writing is pedestrian, the dialogue soporific, the motivation irrational. If I submitted this manuscript to an editor under my by-line it would be rejected immediately.I would have given it no stars, but that was not an option."
1,Awful. Ridiculous story line. Very poorly written.,"1 star is actually generous, but it was the lowest choice I had. I haven't seen the movie, but I found the plot of the book to be very contrived. It strains credulity. Worse, the writing is so baaaaad--trite, unnatural conversations; repetitious phrases throughout; cardboard characters that evoke no sympathy. Except for the sex scenes (which are also wooden and uninspiring), this book appears to have been written for 10-year-olds. Sorry, but that's my opinion."
1,Awful,"As with another reviewer, I am reviewing after 301 reviews. This was awful! I almost couldn't finish it. I don't know about the movie, maybe when it hits video. At first I thought I was really going to love this book, but about 4 or 5 chapters in, I realized that I didn't like Theresa and Garrett and their relationship wasn't realistic. I understand about loving your spouse so much that life is never the same, but it had been 3 years. THREE YEARS!! Get on with life!"
5,Nicholas Sparks get another thumps up,I highly enjoyed both The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. I cried my eyes out while reading both of these books. Sparks makes you believe that true love lasts forever. I can't wait for his next novel.
1,"Trite, Contrived and Boring, Boring, Boring","Message in a Bottle started out beautifully. I was enthralled...for about one chapter. Before I knew it, this book was sailing across the room towards the trash. One of the worst books I have ever read. The dialogue was contrived, the characters unbelievable, and annoying. Don't waste your money."
2,"sophomoric, no moral fiber, how does a loser end up on top?","I thought The Notebook tore at your heart, and left you believing again in true love. This was such a let down. How could any relationship based on deception, and treading on another's grief and loss have ended any other way....what a waste. I disliked Theresa real quick. Decent human beings don't behave like this. There was no real romance that could ever have come from this..........There are really good books that could have been films, this isn't one."
2,"Not an enjoyable ""happily-ever-after""","When I read fiction, I want a book that will leave me feeling good afterwards. I did not get my wish with Message in a Bottle. I wanted to love this book, it has a wonderful premise, but the characters never came to life. I don't even believe they truly loved each other! I suppose, since I hated the ending, that is good. However, if you like this kind of tear-jerker story, read Barbara Delinsky's Three Wishes. At least with it, you will get really mad when the heroine dies, because you will feel like she was someone who could have been your best friend!"
3,"Enjoyable, but you need the hankies at the end!!!","The book was ""lite"" reading. At times, I wanted the plot to be developed a little bit more. Parts of the story were quite moving, but yet there were others that left me wondering. It is tough to put down, and it definitely required a few hankies at the end! I'm looking forward to seeing the movie."
5,An Emotional Look at Love,"I found this book to be one that I didn't want to put down. It grabed me by the heart and wouldn't let go. It's an easy read, but Nichols Sparks has a way of pulling you into his dreams. I wept while reading the last chapters. It still moves me to think about this book!"
4,Romance for all time.,I can only imagine what it would be like to find a love letter of that depth and magnitude. To have been loved the way he loved his wife. What woman wouldn't want to find the man behind the letter? I of course always want to have that happy ending and I was disappointed when he knew that he would die and never see his love again.
3,you could read it... as well as you couldn't!,"mesage in a bottle is n interesting book.i wouldn't characterize it as a ""unique"" book. the story is quite interesting without being one of great inspiration. although filled with beatiful emotions and hard to get over sentimental situations, the lack of style in expresion of the writter is something the reader can't miss. generaly it is a book that is good to read only to fill the empty time you may have! but there are defenatly better books out in the market much more worth reading!"
1,I was searching for a mindless read,"and boy, did I get it with Message. It has been ages since I have read a book so poorly written, with characters so one-dimensional and with dialogue that would embarrass a Harlequin romance writer. I am glad to have finished this book because I laughed my way through it (sometimes until the tears rolled) - although I am certain this was not the effect that Sparks intended with his sappy, stupid story."
2,I was very disappointed!!,"I was so anxious to read this book after reading the book jacket and seeing the movie trailers. It really looked like a tear-jerking romance! However, what had the potential of a great romance turned-out to be a sappy love story with shallow, immature characters and a predictable plot. I never shed a single tear and in fact my skin was crawling with distaste by the time I finished the book."
5,I wouldn't and couldn't put it down!,A touching story of love lost and gained through the lives of two distant souls searching for each other. It shows the journey traveled by two loves when destiny places her hand into life. I recommend this book highly!
4,Enjoyed the book!,"I have read several of Nicholas Spark's books. This is the first abridged title. I will not purchase abridged volumes again. I think I missed a lot. May purchase the unabridged book. That being said, as usual I liked this book."
4,Far better than the movie!,"I admit that I used to be a ""movie only"" person. But Sparks has changed that! With the exception of ""The Notebook"", his stories are superior to the movies they've turned out. I read this before even knowing there WAS a movie then tried to watch. I had Matthew M. as Garrett, Costener disappointed me. In other words...READ THIS BOOK!!"
2,Left a Sour Taste!,"I began reading this book almost immediately after finishing One True Thing by Anna Quindlen, a book which left Message in a Bottle choking in it's dust. Nicholas Sparks' prose seemed shallow and amateurish in comparison, and though at times I was caught up in the story, I frequently found myself feeling impatient with the plot, the characters, the ""style."" The ending was horrible and reminded me of The Horse Whisperer--another book that left me feeling gypped (both books seemed like they were written with an eye toward the Big Screen.) The whole ending felt rushed and slapped together, and Garrett making that final, huge misjudgement seemed totally implausible and out of character."
4,Outstanding piece of work,"I just went through a relationship similar to this and I really could emphatize with the characters. A sad ending, but a heartfelt and stirring drama. An emotion filled book that stirs the human spirit."
2,don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time. This book is predictable, far-fetched, and unbelievable. The only reason I kept reading was that I visualized Kevin Costner and Paul Newman as Garrett and Jeb. I HATED the ending!!!"
3,"Good story, but writing didn't flow.","I saw the movie and then read the book. Both depressed me. It's a pretty good story, but a little sappy. The writing seemed amateurish, with a heavy reliance on a few phrases that he repeated over and over (such as, ""She felt her insides tighten."")"
5,"The most romantic book, it really touched my heart",Nicholas Sparks just described everything so passionately. I loved every little thing about the book. It makes me long for a love that! The ending made me cry unstoppable. I just can't imagine a love so wonderful.
1,"Poorly written, ordinary, and uninspired","If you can identify with a 30-something heroine with the annoying habit of twirling her hair around her finger, and if you enjoy such deft phrasing as ""yesterday night,"" then this book's for you. It wasn't for me...I didn't even finish it. What a disappointment. Maybe the movie's better?"
1,Yuck!,"I loved The Notebook. Thought that this was a man who could really write love stories that touched the core of a woman's heart. Indeed I even saw an old man wiping his eyes over the Notebook in NY! Eagerly anticipated his next novel. Very disappointing. Garrett must be the biggest sap in the world. At times, I wishes Theresa would put the two of us out of our misery and just throw the blasted bottle into the ocean where it obviously belonged!"
5,An interesting story that makes N. C. call you home.,"Nicholas Sparks has always been a storyteller in his own mind and now he has proven himself to the World. Both of his books, Messege in a Bottle and The Notebook are easy reading and take you away. Not like Uncle Remus but a 90's man writing for his time and favorite places. If you want to be taken away you will enjoy these books."
4,Left you kind of dissapointed,"After reading the notebook you totally thought it would be just as good. However, the ending was sad in this one---I wished it ended happiy like the notebook. Oh well it was still a really great book. However they definitely should have made a movie out of THE NOTEBOOK rather than MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE."
2,a quick read,I thought this book was ok....the writing wasn't that good....I did like the story and I couldn't put it down...I wanted to find out what was going to happen....but I didn't like the ending which pretty much spoiled the entire book for me....
2,Artificial-superficial,"I just read Message in a Bottle and I am a little embarrassed to admit it. All I can say is how did it ever get published? How did it ever get made into a movie? Nicholas Sparks is by far the most Artificial and Superficial writer I have read to date. The story is somewhat interesting but, it is like the ingredients to a gourmet dinner left in the hands of an employee of McDonalds. He leaves us gasping in amazement at the vacant emotion and contrived sentimentality. If you want Romance and great writing read Mother of Pearl by Melinda Haynes and Four Letters Of Love by Niall Williams. You will wish you never read anything by Nicolas Sparks..."
4,"Great beach book, but movie will be better....","I read this book while in the Bahamas, so it was an appropriate setting. I also read The Notebook while there. Sparks' writing is not fantastic, but it is refreshing for the sheer fact that he proves men can love like Noah and Garrett do and that men can write of love like Sparks does.The movie has been here in DC for a couple weeks now, and I know I will see it soon. The previews show that it has changed a lot from the book (of course) but the changes actually look positive (more involvement of the father, etc). The fact that the book skips over a lot of the visits between Theresa and Garrett (just alluding to them) bothered me because it didn't allow the reader to fully understand/accept the closeness of their relationship; the movie seems to show more of the visits.So, I give this book 4 stars not because it is a literary masterpiece, but because it was nice to read and it will be nice to see the screen adaptation."
3,"If it wasn't for the ending, I'd give it 5 stars...","What a wonderful love story. There are men out there like that...I have one. I just wish it ended happily...without the tears rolling down my cheeks. If was worth the read, but it sure didn't leave me smiling."
1,Some of the most manipulative dreck I've read in a long time,"History repeats itself with this one. Robert James Waller's precipitous decline after Bridges of Madison County has now been equalled or surpassed with this next book of Nicholas Sparks. Perhaps if it were marketed as a Romance title, it would keep the unsuspecting lover of good fiction from mistakenly picking it up. Cliches abound, the dialogue limps...I felt used."
1,A Total Letdown!,"After having read THE NOTEBOOK, I could not wait to read Nicholas Sparks' next novel. I had insisted that my rather cynical husband read THE NOTEBOOK. I felt that, after 30 years of marriage, we could both relate to this tale of surviving love. He enjoyed it also. Now, I hope that he does not begin to read MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE. I don't want him to realize that I could read such an empty, trite, predictable book! Also, when I began the book, I could not see Kevin Costner playing the romantic thirty something lead. As I read on, it was easy to imagine him, with his pablum like delivery, saying these lines. Note to Mr. Sparks - Chatham is Not on Cape Cod Bay. It is on the opposite side of the Cape on Nantucket Sound and the Atlantic Ocean."
2,Great Start..Predictable Finish,The book was enjoyable about halfway through. It got very predicable and boring at the point where lifestyle decisions had to be made. The only characters with any depth were Jeb and Deanna. It was a struggle to finish! Should have been a short story in a womens' magazine.
3,A Disappointment,"I had first seen the movie to this book and after reading the book I was disappointed because they left out parts that were in the movie, and you just expected them to happen because that was what you had seen in the movie. The book and the movie were both just as emotional and made me cry. I guess that I would have liked to seen the book written just like the movie was.Overall I would suggest that if yu have seen the movie don't read the book, and vice versa."
3,Movie vs. Book and the rest of Sparks' repertoire,"""The book is always better than the movie."" not true. I enjoyed reading ""Message in a Bottle,"" but i actually prefer the movie. Not just because of Paul Newman, but because Theresa was more realistic and likable in the film. Still, the book holds up as one of Sparks' better novels, not as good as ""The Notebook,"" but better than some of his more recent works ""At First Sight,"" ""Dear John,"" which seem to follow an unwavering formula for writing. All his books are the same and I'm getting bored."
4,"Sappy romance, quality use of words","Theresa Osborne may be the luckiest girl in the world. She may be the only girl ever having actually fallen in love with the other side of that mysterious bottle found in the lapping waves of the Atlantic.A plot that may be too hard for those of us stiffled of our imagination to hear, much less believe, Sparks does enlighten his heavily-sopped novel with text as easy to read, and relate to, as every day conversation. In an end as perplexing as the entire plot itself, Sparks redeems himself with the knowledge that Theresa and her son Kevin live next door, her shady past is just like ours and why not dream for every romantic message in a bottle?"
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent","Great read. Another book to read when the weather is bad and the kids are in bed. If you like unpredictable romance, then this is the book for you."
5,"If You Hang On, It's Great!","This was the first book I've ever read from Nicholas Sparks. And he's an excellent author. I had a little trouble keeping up at first because he keeps going back-and-forth in time as he tells the story in this book, but it's worth sticking with it. I was completed wrapped up by about page 100. :) It's a great story about how we can find love -- if we'll only go after it."
3,Message in a bottle.,"This was an unexpected story. It kept me on the edge of my seat anticipating what was going to happen next. I really enjoyed the story line, but i didn't enjoy the ending. Yes it was sad, but i couldn't cry over it. But it was great reading."
2,Not as good as his first book,"I loved his first book, The Notebook, not because Mr. Sparks is such an eloquent writer, but because he told such a poignant story. I found this story much less compelling and overly maudlin. I thought the ending was a soap opera-ish and I closed the book w/ disappointment and some disgust for having spent the time reading the book."
1,"boring, boring, boring","This book does not even deserve the one star I'm giving it. It was so drawn out, long winded and predictable that I nearly went into a coma!"
3,Pass the hanky!,"All in all, I enjoyed ""Message in a Bottle"". It is a very romantic book. I did not appreciate the tendency for the relationship to immediately proceed to a sexual one, especially as sex before marriage is wrong, but the love story outside of that was beautiful. The only other bad thing about the book (besides the sex) was that it made me realize what I don't and never will have, and think about things I shouldn't."
5,Absolutely loved it!,"Stories like this renew one's faith in love,in spite of a tearful ending. I loved the movie, so I decided to read the book and I am glad I did. Even though I already knew the plot, I found myself unable to put it down. Nicholas Sparks has given us a story about the love we all dream about, but rarely find. Most of the details were different from the movie which kept me glued until the last page. I also listened to the score from the movie while I read--this really added to the mood and made the ending even more emotional. After finishing, I rushed out and bought The Notebook (loved it too). I have found a gem in Nicholas Sparks and the incredible love he writes about!"
1,Danger Will Robinson - Avoid this and read something decent,"I liked the Notebook. I made my husband read it. I hated Message in a Bottle, I could barely get myself to finish it. Obviously, this book was written for the money. Boring, oh so predictable and a waste of time."
5,A Wonderful Author,"I just want to say for everyone out there who doesn't appreciate Nicholas Sparks: Read Again. This man has a truly gifted way with words. He doesn't get all tied up and flowery the way some writers do. He tells it as it is and lets the readers wander through his stories. When I read The Notebook, I cried and proceeded to recommend it to all my friends and family. When I read Message in a Bottle, I felt the same way. The only time I felt truly let down was when I watched the movie. The only tears there were tears of frustration at seeing a beautiful story fall to pieces before my eyes. I felt the same way at The Horse Whisperer. My recommendation is to read this book on a rainy afternoon with a cup of coffee and enjoy."
3,Good Romance Novel for Teenagers,"Message in a Bottle was a nice idea---certainly a very romantic one, to say the least. It attests to the fact that love is out there if you just seek it out, and don't give up, no matter what sort of dumb rap life has handed you in the past. The ability to love is the ability to be alive. Even though I read this book within two days, and I found the storyline romantic, I feel that it was written on a very immature level, lacking the sexual tension or mystery a true romance demands,lacking any depth,and utilizing too many cliches and to many theatrics. I was able to figure out what was going to happen next without much effort. I think that this book will appeal more to my pre-teen daughter, who still enjoys the writing style of Judy Blume."
2,A big disappointment,"After reading ""The Notebook"" I eagerly looked forward to ""Message in a Bottle"". What started out to be a promising read slowly became insipid and banal. I finished the book only in the hope that it would improve. It didn't. Still, I'm looking forward to Mr. Sparks third book, ""A Walk to Remember"" because ""The Notebook"" was THAT good."
2,"Highly overrated, mawkish","A totally predictable, shallow, overly clever and underplotted piece of mawkish sentimentallity. I kept reading it just because I knew I was SUPPOSED to find the story affecting, but wasn't even able to come up with a single tear at the ending. If Sparks's ambition is to join the ranks of one-dimensional romantic novelists, he's going to have to improve a little. I'll be sure and pass up ""The Notebook."""
1,Enough to make anyone seasick.,The fact that this literary tripe has spent so many days on the bestseller lists convinces me that American taste has truly sunk to the lowest common denominator. I had to check the verso page of this to see if I was reading a foreign translation. I couldn't believe that a book so poorly written could be accepted by a publisher. Shame on you!
1,Probably the worst writing I have ever seen.,"I do not even know why I continued reading this book when after only the first three pages I realized how hacked the writing and how idiotic the story are. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue seems to have been written by a star-struck teeny bopper romantik girlyboy still struggling through high school. I only finished the book out of morbid fascination. In other words, this kind of writing earns millions???"
1,Very Disappointing!,"I picked up this book, impressed with it being on the NY Times Bestseller list as well as an impending movie with Kevin Costner and Paul Newman. Had no idea what it was supposed to be about.........kept waiting for some plot twists or SOMETHING. This book was unbelievabley boring, unrealistic and predictable! Yikes. Don't waste your time."
1,Message to Sparks: Take a Class,"Someone should tell the author of ""Message in a Bottle"" that a description of someone grilling steaks is NOT the same as exposition! I read ""Message"" after hearing much praise for Sparks's first novel. What a waste of time! While fiction requires ""the willing suspension of disbelief"" on the part of the reader, this piece of fiction used up my willingness far too soon and gave too little in return. Nothing about this novel makes me want to believe--not the characters, not the far-fetched plot, not the use of dialogue where description would do.Perhaps Mr. Sparks can spend a fraction of his writing income to attend a good fiction-writing workshop and then try again. In the meantime, I will stick to Booker short-list titles."
4,"""Sleepless in Seattle"" meets ""Gillian on Her 37th Birthday""","The members of my book group and I really enjoyed this read. It captivated me throughout the whole book. But i would have to say my favorite part of this book, and the part that peaked all of our interest, was the secret steak recipe. We actually had a get together using his recipe on the grill last week. C'est Magnifique!"
2,The Sincerest Form of Flattery,"Message In A Bottle is a decent summer read for romantics. For those, seeking a compelling story, ""who cares?"" may scream over the beach. For some of us Civil War buffs, Theresa's final message in a bottle may have a familiar ring to it. Compare the contents of Theresa's prose with Major Sullivan Ballou's last letter to his wife before the battle of Bull Run. It was probably the most emotional momment of PBS & Ken Burns' CIVIL WAR Series. The letter is on page 82 of the series book. Looks like Nicholas Sparks is a historical romantic or something like that."
2,Big disappointment,"I had read Spark's book, The Notebook, and loved it. It was very sensitive and well written. I should have known from the title, ""Message in a Bottle"" that this book would not be good. The title was childish, and the writing was a very big disappointment. As I read it I kept wishing that the author had not written another book. This was not an intelligent, believable story. Now it seems to me that Nicolas Spark just got lucky with his first book and doesn't have the skill and talent to pursue writing. I don't know if I would waste my time picking up another book he might write. What a disappointment!"
4,Not as good as The Notebook,"This was a good, quick reading love story that got pretty sappy at the end. I have to admit, I cried. It was not as good as the Notebook, but definately worth the time it took to read it."
2,A new level of banality.,"This book was selected by one member of my book club. I suggest we expel her. The book has some of the least imaginative dialogue I have ever read in a published work. It is obvious that the author had an intriguing idea,the romantic messages, but then had no idea where to go with it. Having read other reviews I am fascinated by the descriptions of this novel as romantic. Romance has to have a level of passion, and passion is not to be found on these pages. Even their individual ruminations on the relationship are shallow and uninteresting. The final ""tragic"" twist is obviously an attempt to give some tiny bit of substance to the work, but in order for you to view something as tragic you have to care about the characters, and the author created plastic people like Garrett, the poor man's Heathcliff. The message must have been in a diet soda bottle because this puppy was very, very,light!"
4,unnerving yet an excellent read...,"Well unfortunately Theresa messed up here. But interestingly enough, while the reader can at some point predict the ending, it is still impossible to put the book down. Hurry up Sparks and write another book!"
5,"FANTASTIC, THIS IS A MUST READ","Nicholas Sparks is a brilliant story teller. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. It was if I was one of the characters.I felt like I knew these people. I have never read a book that made me feel this way., immediately you were brought right in and the story kept going and going. This book will stay with you for a long time. (Make sure you have kleenex close by)"
2,how do writers this bad get to have bestsellers?,"I got this book because the romanticism appealed to me. However, the only reason I read the thing was because I can't drop a book unfinished. I had to find out what happened. While the plot was farfetched, I did enjoy it. What got to me was the terrible writing. This man took a really neat idea for a plot and completely screwed it up. I had absolutely no sense of who the characters really were, and no sense of why Garret had a relationship with either Catherine or Theresa. Yeah they were all nice people, but the quirkiness and closeness that brings people together was absolutely lacking here. I wish I could write novels so I could rewrite this the way it should be written."
1,what happened!!!,"I looooooved The notebook it was one of my favorite books and I couldn't wait to read Message in a bottle. I was disapointed to say the least.I had no feelings for any of the characters and i usually cry over EVERYTHING!!!!!Boring and a big waste of time the only reason I even finished it was I had the flu and was stuck in bed!Nicholas please redeem yourself, Did you fall and bump your head honey?"
5,How will they do the movie??,"I read the book and loved it. I agree, there were some really slow parts. But I loved this book. I began to feel very close to the characters. I cannot wait for the movie. I am curious to how they are going to do all of those flash backs. I will be there on Feb.12th waiting in line. What a perfect weekend to release it. (Valentine's Weekend.) It is sure to be a success."
2,Big disappointment,"Wow was I disappointed, I really loved ""The Notebook"" it was charming and quite touching however I felt as if I were back in high school reading ""True Romance"" magazines. This was much to predictable and a bit to maudlin for my taste. Come on Mr. Sparks based on your first novel you can do better!!"
1,The writing is sophomoric and the story is treacle.,"I cannot understand how a writer of such little talent can be on any bestseller list. He wrote as if he wished to rush through the story. The characters are wooden, devoid of life; characatures of lovers. The author conveys no sense of place in his description of the Carolina coast. The story is about two self absorbed people who cannot seem to get on with their lives, but the reader is apparently supposed to accept them as deep people with grand philosophies of love. I found the main characters to be two people I would not want to spend an evening with. This book should be banished to the Romantic sections of bookstores, and placed on the bottom racks. Perhaps then people would not waste their money on this treacle."
3,"Good, but disappointing","After reading the Notebook I thought I had found a great author, but my expectations weren't met with Message in a Bottle. Too much like The Bridges of Madison County or Sleepless in Seattle, this was a cliched book about an unlikely event. It was a decent read, but I expected more from the man who wrote The Notebook, and the ending was far from happy."
2,"FALLS SHORT! Trite, sugary, over-done wanna-be tear-jerker.","Too many coincidences. If you believe in modern day fairy tales...this is your cup of tea. I felt that it was overly done. This was a highly stylized knock-off of a previous book, The Bridges of Madison County. Except now, instead of BRIDGES, it's BOATS. It's all been done!!! The characters are definitely out of central casting. BUT, if you are in the mood for a sapppy summer read/beach book, without any thought required, I guess you could do worse. Majorly improbable plot....on many levels. Sparks takes the reader through bumpy twists and turns...and asks the reader to believe in all the incredible detours along the way..NO WAY would a sophisticated reader go for this. I feel that Sparks was waiting for a movie deal as he wrote this one, maybe even with the leading players chosen????? Too sugary....too sappy...take some insulin....before trying to buy into this love story. The ending was there for all to see by the end of chapter one."
1,Horrible,"Combine the movie ""The Titanic"" with the curse of the Kennedy Family and you have ""A Message in a Bottle"". This book uses these type of tactics to claim the readers emotions.The book is slow with undeveloped characters. If you're too happy(?), read this book because it will definitly bring you down a few notches."
3,A Hard Act to Follow,"Having loved The Notebook and Sparks' unique and beautiful way with words, I found myself embarrassed for him while reading this trite book. The most interesting character was Jeb (Garrett's father) who spouted wisdom and wit worth reading. The story line was predictable, too wordy and, as I said before, embarrassing. One part in particular, when Theresa's best friend, Debbie, suggested she go on the trip to get more exposure for her career (after encouraging Theresa's and Garrett's relationship to this point) was out of character. I am sorry to say I didn't cry, because I love books that let me cry. I'm trying to think of one thing I got out of the book -- Sparks does have a way with words, but the plot was shallow and the water too deep."
3,Falls short of The Notebook,"Sparks'second novel falls short of The Notebook. While it held my attention I must say that the dialogue and writing were full of cliches. At first I thought I had picked up a book belonging to the romance genere. By the time I had read the first 200 pages I thought ""I've had enough"". Theresa came across as devious in my eyes, and Garrett a weak victim. BUT, thank goodness I read on for the end saves the story. This tale could have been told in a shorter format without a lot of useless descriptions. The letters found in the bottles were very moving and all-in-all the story sends a powerful message about learning to let go."
3,Bauhaus.,"I know that seems dismissive, but the samples confirm it. Chris Bradshaw channels Peter Murphy, while the rhythm section (NIN alumni Sean Beavan and Charlie Clouser) supplants David J. and Kevin Haskins. Mick Cripps brings some guitar swagger. ""Write My Name in Blood"" appeared on a Cleopatra compilation from 1996, and these songs finally went to CD in 2006. Money, legal delays, I dunno.The songs aren't bad - they just echo that other band. ""The Last Thing You'll Ever Know"" stands out as what we'd hear on Peter Murphy's ""Deep"". Several tracks like ""Either Way"" and ""Portrait of Charlotte"" have decent dancefloor potential. Nearly all the songs hang the 120-130 BPM range.So, ""The Frozen Lies"" does its job without putting in much overtime. Again, not bad, just not crucial if you own any Bauhaus/Peter Murphy/Love and Rockets. I'm glad the band finally got the CD to market, because it's a shame to spend time and money on music just to leave it in mothballs."
2,Depressing,"While Malamud is without doubt a very skilled writer, I gave up attempting to read this book approximately 1/3 of the way through it. The atmosphere of the book was overwhelmingly dour and depressing: story after story of loneliness, poverty, bleakness, bitterness, struggle, alienation from family. It leaves one ready to jump off a bridge somewhere."
5,An Outstanding Account of the Development of U.S. F.P.,"It was with great anticipation that I began reading Walter Lafeber's The American Age. After reading his Inevitable Revolutions, I instantly became a fan of his writings. In The American Age, LaFeber takes the issue of U.S. Foreign Policy and systematically analyses it with great clarity and focus. He has made effective use of primary sources throughout the piece and has clearly shown the different veins of U.S Foreign Policy that have arised, from the evasion of military alliances of the Washington Period, to Taft's Dollar Diplomacy. I felt that the usage of editorial cartoons throughout the text was an excellent idea, as it allowed the reader to have a sense of the public mood during the era in question. In sum, I would declare that The American Age is a must for any reader interested in American Foreign Policy, not only as a reliable guide for facts and figures but also for a thoroughly enjoyable read"
3,"First, buy Australia","I bought ""Australia"" a couple days beforehand and listened to it for about a week straight before I went out and bought ""Stop all the world now."" Don't get me wrong. It's fantastic, but does not compare to ""Australia."" She Says - #7 is still excellent on this cd, but on Australia it has that sound that makes it so original - here, it's too polished. Yet I still recommend it. But buy Australia first."
1,This is a retreat from everything that's made this guy great,Don't waste your time with this album. The Madrigals LP is by FAR the best buy for your money. You get the DVD and a good sampling of songs all for about 10 bucks. With the band Howie's talent is virtually eliminated.
1,copy cat,"Can anyone tell that not one melody concieved by this lame artist is original. Next time you listen to ""Perfect Time of Day,"" I want you to recall the the melody of the song ""Tell Me All Your Thoughts On God."" Even the opening lines of the song discuss the time of day, ""Must have been late afternoon."" Of course I don't expect everyone to hear the melodic rip offs Mr. Day has pulled, I have an ear for it (being a fellow Boston Troubador,from Maine no doubt) When I hear ""Austrailia,"" I hear so many rip offs from Radiohead's OK Computer and the late departed Jeff Buckley. I have herad that Day is influenced by both Musical Phenomenons. Jeff Buckley would bend over and puke if he heard Howie Days voice, as for Radiohead; Is there any musician in the world right now that is not influenced by Radiohead. My point made. Don't buy the albums,listen to the sound samples and run."
3,"Not as good as Madrigals, but good!","This album comes together better than Australia did. Yet, as HD comes closer to being a big star, he slowly falls back into the ""mainstream"" crowd with all the other solo artists. Howie Day has an amazing ambience and sound to him when he performs live, the way the music flows, the emotion, the general atmosphere. The overproduced albums that are being sold (other than Madrigals EP) are trashy mushy adult contemporary that you'd find on a bad radio station. I suggest finding some Bootlegs of his live stuff or talking to a real fan who recorded one of his shows. You used to be allowed to record his shows, now you can't since he's signed to a big bad label(Epic)."
3,Howie (will get there some) Day,"Howie Day's music is easy on the ears and so is his voice, but his songs are lacking in depth. Great singer/songwriters are also great story tellers, and you get the impression Howie just hasn't had enough life experience yet. For now, it's great music for girls in middle school, but I'd like to see what he does with his talent as he matures."
5,"catch this guy early, before everyone else does","When this album came out Howie Day had already proven himself as an outstanding solo performer. His powerful, college level lyrics make him more appealing to those of us who are tired of hearing the same old cutesy cliches.I have to admit that I wasn't sure about the new album before I had heard it. I saw this guy live in DC the night before the album was released and was able to get it that night. This guy blossoms with the band, who helps him do things with his songs that he wouldn't be able to do by himself.Buy this album, along with his other one, ""Australia"", and his EP, then find some live solo stuff from the past, and I promise you that you will not be disappointed.- Word"
3,Oops,"Still not close to his solo Live stuff. I stll think he's alot more talented then the other young, ""snger songwriters"". Which you cant even call Day anymore since he's had help writing every song on here... As to bands that are influenced by radiohead, i could name about a thousand. Radiohead did not do anything groundbreaking in terms of chord progressions and I dont see Day putting bleeps and blips all over his stuff.plain and simple, if you like overproduced pop songs youll enjoy this, but if your loking for the deeper Day, its not here."
5,Living up to his good name.,"I'll admit I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this album after hearing John Mayer's big label follow up(which was total garbage). I didn't want to see another great artist ,whose first self-produced album was great, put out a crappy follow up after they were picked up by a big name label. All fears must be laid to rest. This album envokes a sort of magical sound and mood. It makes John Mayer's follow up seem absolutely lifeless in comparison. Howie's voice echos throughout the tracks,and the instrumental is powerful and incindiary. The album is as passionate as it is soulful. I didn't reach for the skip button once, the sign of a truly great album. He truly lives up to his good name with this 3rd release."
5,pick this up!!,"this album flat out is an amazing venture for howie day, as he takes his listeners on a journey through beautifully orchestrated songs. this singer/songwriter isnt the typical ""strumming guitars/mellow music"" kind of guy, as mr. day has an incredible attention to melody, sounds dynamics, and his particular audience. his music isn't easy to describe, but i strongly recommend this album to anyone interested in a unique singer/songwriter."
5,Brilliant,"This album is increddible. Why are you reading this review? If you don't have it yet, order it RIGHT NOW. Every song is amazing, it's one of the best albums in years. Favorites- Collide, Sunday Morning Song, She Says."
2,Wrong Direction,"it wasn't long ago that howie day had a created a major buzz in the college music community. now he (and his label) have purchased a buzz on vh1 and other outlets. in these past few years day has signed a big time record deal and formed a band. most older fans blame his new mediocrity on the fact that he does not play solo any longer. this is not the problem, the problem: his new songs are weak. they are just bad, no song on stop all the world now can hold a candle to an australia track. many people say they are ripoffs and such, this is not as much the case as they just suck. sure australia has its major holdups (cheezy production), but the songs were great. it doesn't matter if day ditches his band, he won't be the same unless he can recreate the magic his first songs had."
2,Barry Manilow Redux,"Sorry, but Howie is one deep rut. Little troubadour with a big voice. First disc, Howie strummed and delivered half a good album. Now,he and his producer confuse seriousness with signifcance and give us 52 minutes of bombast. Virtually every song follows the exact same structure: Howie starts with a whisper or aspirant syllable, shifts into normal voice, then adds strings and begins screaming over them. Just like Barry Manilow, Howie seems to think that volume equals emotion. It doesn't. And who's idea was it to take a decent song ""She Says"" from Australia and add all the schmaltz? Is Howie making music or auditioning for rot like American Idol?"
2,What happened to Howie???,"maybe I'm jumping the gun because I haven't listened to it enough, but this doesn't even sound like him anymore....It's over produced, he sounds vocally stiff and he lacks the emotion he had on the previous records. there is not one just solo acoustic number, all the songs have drums and/or alot of string stuff going on. I guess I'll wait for the new record for some stripped down emotion that I can relate to."
5,Cannot stop listening!!,Stop all the World now is one of the best albums that I have listened to in a very long time.
5,real science about real life,"With so many books that just recycle the same cliches about relationships on the market (think: Mars/Venus), it it can be amazing to find one that actually has new things to say. This may be because the author is not some self-appointed expert but a veteran scientist who has published extensively in the research literature in social psychology. This book describes not just the conclusions but the scientific research on which the conclusions are based. The reader will learn a lot about psychology in general as well as about relationships. The topics include everything from flirting to passion to long-term marriages, and some of the conclusions are surprising. Finally, everything the book says is rooted in a fundamental view of human nature based on modern research in evolutionary psychology. This is a fun read and you will learn something too."
2,Geeksturbation with a touch of love,"You can tell that Bromberg is a bass lover, a Jaco lover, a music lover even. So why the hell does he (and he's not alone) produce such an endless catalog of drivel. This is garabge. He is a geek. He has no soul. Someone removed it surgically from him a long time ago, assuming he ever had any. And the music he's producing is the soulless output of a man who has no idea what real R&B, real jazz (not the honkified brand of mainstream crap that passes and has passed for the last 20 years), real music is all about. It makes me angry to listen to him butcher these songs. Jaco's seminal first solo release. These were masterpieces, most of them, and he layers synth and noodling solos over his ""interpretations"" of the Jaco bass lines, thereby totally decimating the integrity of the melodies, harmonies and musicianship of the original. It's just all gone. Well done, Mr. Bromberg. You've done it again. Man, even his name sounds cheesy. Don't buy this record!"
3,Opening yourself to a lot of criticism...,"Jaco playing smooth jazz at geritol tempos? I think not. This attempt is certainly not in the spirit of Jaco. It's like taking Miles' ""Kind of Blue"" and turning it into a smooth jazz album - some things you just don't do. And duplicating the original Jaco'75 album cover tells me you had to know you were gonna open yourself to criticism. There is no question Bromberg can play, but the spirit of Jaco really isn't there. Can you imagine Chris Botti duplicating Miles' ""In a Silent Way"" album cover and pawning it off as homogenized jazz? Would be a bad idea from the start...Musicians know what I'm talking about. Non-Musicians won't get what I'm saying, and that's o.k., It's all good."
1,What's this about ?,"To me, this record is like a desecration of a grave. Or was this thing done for money making purposes ? It is not even good. Like a reviewer wrote before, he has turned the uniquely soulful original music and very precise and strong playing of Jaco Pastorius into muzak. I can't stand the cover. Without any shame he poses and replaces Jaco. Why is that ? Why not do something more original ?Need some cheap attention ? I just don't get it. And what about those terrible fret noises on ""portrait of Tracy"" ? Arrgh.To me, he is very wrong."
3,Sixpence None the Richer!,"Ok, I really listened to this recording and it is still sounding to me like they were trying very hard to sound like the recording of ""Sixpence None the Richer"" featuring ""Kiss Me""!The onlything that stuck with me was the track""Don't Dream It's Over""(number 4). I like sixpence along with the style that they perform, but this recording wasn't like I thought it would be. I was looking for something different then this: it reminds me in places of their other recording that I talked about above.If you have never heard of Sixpence None the Richer, you can start with this and you will want some of their older recordings ; which I feel that you will want too have in order to understand any of them!On a scale of 1-5, I have too give it a 3, because at least they have put-out another recording and that they have tried to fill some of the gap that was needed for several listeners like myself!"
3,They've done it again,"Wow, what a beautiful album musically. Which tends to be such a rare thing these days. Real artistry throughout. I especially like ""Still Burning's"" haunting lyric and style. And ""Dizzy"" is hypnotic with its message of our seeming insignificance but poignant need to worship. The musicality is especially good on this piece. But really all the songs show a great latitude in writing that we've come to expect from Sixpence. See them on the tonight show Nov 7."
3,"Got this after hearing ""Don't Dream It's Over"" in a movie","For some reason, and I don't understand quite why, but I'll always think of Sixpence None the Richer as a glorified cover band. The songs I recall most fondly of theirs, besides that chirpy ""Kiss Me"" song that was played on the radio too much, aren't their songs. Sixpence, who did good covers of ""Dancing Queen"" and ""There She Goes"" on other albums, is excellent with other people's songs, though, which is why I bought this after hearing only a snippet of ""Don't Dream It's Over"" during a preview for the movie, ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.""Leigh Nash's bright voice, still capable of conveying the emotional weight of the Crowded House song, is delightful on that tune and others on the album - though the original tunes they've done on this album aren't nearly as memorable. I just found myself listening to the one song over and over after listening to the whole CD only once."
3,Discontent an apt title,"Musically, Divine Discontent pales in comparison with Sixpence's last two albums. Every song but two begins with a quiet piano or accoustic guitar line and steadily builds, leaving a tepid pop song. The percussion is weak throughout, both in volume and quality, and Nash never stretches her vocal expression. Sixpence's previous albums were so much more interesting and energetic; This Beautiful Mess is a great rock record, maybe the best guitar album in the Christian catalogue, and the eponymous breakout album displayed an amazing diversity of styles and instrumentation. Now, though, this latest album shows little excitement or exploration. Divine Discontent never rocks or swings. You can listen to it while reading and it hardly calls attention to itself.At least the lyrics maintain their quality. Slocum is clearly still a good song writer. And, I must admit, Melody of You is a wonderful worship song."
5,A Melodical Journey,"I honestly must say that I purchased this cd because I adore the single "" Breathe your name"" but I have to admit that the entire record is stunning; Leigh Nash has a very charming voice and the musicians are fantastic. Every song gets your heart and carries you away in a melodical journey. ""Down and out of time"" is probably my favorite song but there are a lot of brilliant efforts from the stupendous cover of Crowded House' "" Don't dream, it'over"" to the catchy ""Waiting on the sun"";from the beautiful ""I've been waiting"" to the touching ""Melody of you"" and from the intense ""Eyes wide open"" to the tender ""A million parachutes"".Buy it, it's such a great album and let me give a suggestion:If it's possible, listen to this cd close to the sea, watching the sunset, you will feel unforgettable emotions."
4,"Good cd, but not as good as their others...","This is definately Sixpence, but I feel this album doesn't capture my attention as their others have. I still think it's a good album, but I would recommend getting their other albums beofre this one."
3,Disappointing,"Why doesn't Sixpence realize that 'This Beautiful Mess' is the best CD they have ever made... It was so good that, ever since then, I have called myself a huge Sixpence fan for that disc along. I have been patiently awaiting a CD that was equal to that in creativity and intensity, but thus far I have been disappointed. I really had high hopes for this one in particular. It is okay, but no where near as good as 'This Beautiful Mess' or a live Sixpence show."
3,Divinely boring at times.,"A CD that needed more Leigh Nash's imagination and spiritually. I reaally wanted to love this CD, but I could not. I liked the earlier recordings.If you love SNIR, buy their greatest hits and praise God!"
4,New and Old... It's all good,"I love almost everything I've heard from sprung monkey, this album is no different. It's not as serious as some of their other music, but it has a really nice upbeat feel to almost all the songs, and their cover of coconut is awesome and funny at the same time. I really wish I could find more bands as good as these guys that are willing to re-invent themselves and experiment with other genres. ""Get a Taste"" is the kind of album you want for those clear summer days at the beach when the waves are 3 to 5' and clean, and everything seems to be perfect. It's a feel good album and definitely worth your purchase."
5,Sprung Monkey Hasnt Just Sprung Up,"This Album By the San Diego Based Band Is probably there best to date with songs like ""party like a rock star"" and the title track ""What's that you say"" the album really kicks you in the throat with some really awsome music plus the band is currenlty on tour with the kottonmouth kings on the ""stoners reeking havoc tour"" and is putting on a incredible show Sprung monkey is ready and willing to move you so if you ask me you should take a taste of ""Get A Taste"" ."
3,I find myself forcing my self to like the game,"I find myself forcing my self to like the game, because I loved on the Dreamcast. But now it is back to reality. Madden is simply better"
2,The gameplay [stinks].,I traded in madden 2003 to get this game. And I wish I hadent. The gameplay [stinks]. For ex. Just when Im about to throw the ball a defender just touches me a little and the ball is tipped and always intercepted. Plus you can hardely see your recivers open because it zooms in on the quarterback to much. Well I got my madded game back and Trust me You should stick with madden. The only thing good was the graphics.
3,Jeez,"Bad game, I mean, I really should have gotten madden, everything is kind of bad, i mean once a quarter back broke his wrist and then they put didin't have a back up Q. The graphics are ok. I mean after a while it's like same old same old, give me a break. Seriously, I didn't play it for 3 month spread once. My advice is buy th Madden sereis, much much better!!"
3,It's O.K.,"I rented this game and it is very hard. I can't even score! Although the graphics are cool and it looks realistic, it's just flat out hard. It is pretty fun, but that and the graphics are just about all the cool stuff yer gonna get! I tried to rent Madden but is was already rented. If you want true football, chose a Madden."
3,the good the badd and the cruddy,Ok all you football gamers heres the lowdown. The ESPN feature is AWESOME. Commentary is smooth and presentation is super realistic. So why isn't there a 5 up at the top of your screen? Gameplay is dissapointing. A.I. is too difficuld and players slow down and speed up at uneven rates.BOTTOM LINE: Not the years best football game but certainly better than 2K2.
4,Difficult music that needs repeated listening,"""The sky moves sideway"" represents Porcupine's experimental era.Steven Wilson Composed long difficult suite (title track) and a few shorter tracks.the suite is interesting, very emotional but sometimes it becomes a bit boring and slightly too long - but it doesn't changes that all album is very good.Title suite along with paranoic rocker ""Dislocated day"",dark moody ballad ""the moon touches your shoulder"" or ambient influenced hypnotic ""Moonloop"" are making this album.Steven Wilson (vocal,guitar,band's leader) shows his abbility to connect many ideas into one huge great piece of music.This album needs repeated listening.it may seem boring and pointless but after some time you wil get used to hypnotic dreamer atmosphere that this group creates on this album (and on others too)."
3,Overrated effort tho still good,"I would personally consider this album to be somewhere in the middle of the pack of PT albums. The first half, consisting of the extended multi-suite title track, plus the poignant ""Stars Die"" is indeed top-notch, but since I am reviewing the entire album, I have to point out the uneven and poorly-conceptualized second half as well. This album more than any other of theirs does have the most [Pink] ""Floydish"" aura, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing (name me one current band without any influences-there ain't any). Still I prefer the more poppy material off their last two albums (Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun)."
2,"Pure Sade, but terrible as far as remixes go.","I am a diehard Sade fan & was ECSTATIC to have found this rare import. Unfortunately, the remixing is HORRIBLE! If you want to listen to Sade, listen to her regular albums because this CD is like listening to her while another (boring) radio station is playing simultaneously. Definitely not worth the high price & definitely a plug for self-remixing! Sade is still #1, but this CD is not!"
5,love is stronger than pride,sade is one of the rarest voices in history of songs & music would love to hear her sing again.
3,Good -when it worked,"Worked great for 3 months,,,then red/green lights kept flashing simultaneously and stopped working all together...searched online of fixes, messed with charging tabs,,,no luck,,,,batteries hold charge so they worth the money,,,charger blows Wouldn't recommend"
1,"Right-Wing Revisionist Trash, Garbage","Comes now Paul Bremer to say what he should have been saying in public all along: the invasion was understaffed and driven by political, not military/tactical, motives. The reason this country is in the trash is that people like Bremer didn't have the guts to speak truth to power. We see this gutless, pathetic behavior amoung Republicans very often. They display loyalty to Bush and then when they are not on the payroll, they tell how they really feel, whow the really should have acted. It is unpatriotic to the higest degree to betray the soliders with this kind of beahvior. It is not leadership, but fear that has ruled Paul Bremer. He will be remembers not for his action, but his inactions. He is not a good American. There is the blood of innocents on his hands. He is guilty."
5,Extra-important facts about Saddam's days as head of Iraq,"And just how bad a ruler Saddam was. Bremer points out how in 1988 (in just one morning!) Saddam had more than 5000 Iraqi Kurds, in the Kurdish town of Halabja, killed by gas bombs. On page 53 he points this out 15 pages after reaffirming the idea that Saddam idolized and modeled himself after Soviet mass murderer Joe Stalin, the Iraqi did this by (among other ways) using Stalin's old practice of using forced populations to resettle in areas to inflame ethnic and religious tensions. Saddam did this by deliberately forcing Sunni arabs into non-Arab/Kurdish territory where conflict was a sure thing. Thank God Saddam was taken down by President Bush as Bremer proves through ugly and true statements like these. Again THANK GOD!!!!"
3,"Barely a first-person source, more like selective telling of the facts","Read this book with Rajiv Chandrasekaran's Imperial Life to get the full impact of Bremer's story. Pay attention to the details Bremer glosses over, like what Bernie Kerik did (the guy in charge of rebuilding Iraq police). Ignored is the background and selection process of the people who served Bremer and how ""loyalists"" were more valued over experience and skill.At times selective in the facts and other times ignorant, this book is useful only in reading the perceptions of reality the viceroy of Iraq held."
2,Nicely Written Untruths,Read Woodward's book and then look back at this one. Bremer is an arrogant fool as responsible for the mess in Iraq (if not more so) than the Bush admin (except for Rumsfeld)
1,My year in Iraq,"I hope that this book will not be bought by many people.I made the mistake of buying it, and then saw him defending the contradictions between his public statements at the time and the book. He pointed it out that as a public servant he had to ""speak the party line or quit"" and he decided not to quit. That is bad enough but don't shame yourself and insult your readers by writing a book to justify your failures. Colin Powell should not write a book like this. Silence is second only to genius and Bremer is not a genius."
2,The War Is a Waste of Time Because of Bremmer,"I read this book hoping to find answers as to why our war in Iraq is going so poorly. I found a partial answer: Bremmer's policies. The text reveals a bureaucrat who played things safe, instead of taking bold steps in the early days to transform Iraqi society into a modern state, instead of one torn apart by cynical politicians who use religion and ethnicity as weapons to gain power. I don't blame Bremmer alone, as it is clear that the departments of state and of defense didn't really know what they were doing. Meanwhile, our soldiers die for a war that threatens to undermine the moral fabric of American society."
1,"Enough, already! Just like McNamara and Vietnam","If you choose to be silent, then please just shut up!It's one thing for everyone to charge that the current Administration was clueless about Iraq, because it appointed a Kissinger crony like L. Paul Bremer III to run Iraq, even though he hadn't the foggiest notion of counter-insurgency. All of those brilliant geo-strategists don't know their butts from a hole in the ground. [no oil, sorry]Just read this from Steve Gilliard's news blog. If you still want to read the book, go ahead, but don't buy it new.(...)-"
1,What a moron -- just shut up & go away,"I wouldn't advise anyone to waste time or money reading the justifications Bremer proffers in his book to whitewash his terrible record in Iraq. He should keep quite and disappear from the public forever. He is neither an administrator nor a diplomat, and had no business accepting this task. Bremer bungled the CPA from beginning to end, and miraculously caused $$millions (some say billions even)of our tax-payer $$ to disappear (into his pocket??.. hmmm... we will never know as the Bush admin covered that up pretty quickly). Not to mention having allowed / ignored / participated in / the organized looting of Baghdad's museums' priceless treasures. I later met several of his shifty cohorts (not all Americans, thank the Lord for small mercies) who have reinvented themselves into ""humanitarian aid workers"" in various African countries, and are still engaged in syphoning away funds intended for victims of famines and natural disasters."
3,China junk,"This clamp has so much side play it's funny. with it bolted down I can literally move the hold down inches side to side.-Edit- 1 star became 3 star. So it's still moves side to side the same but when it clamps, it holds very tight. Not as bad a tool as I thought it would be and will buy a couple more for my welding table."
4,"A Quick, Enriching Read","Dr. Valerie Allen's book of childhood neglect and abuse is as informative as it is engrossing. It is comfortable in the hand and uncomfortable in the heart, as you turn page after page of a story of dysfunction while the protagonist wends her way from disassociation to love and acceptance.Dedicated to the women in our world struggling to be free of oppression, Dr. Allen's book is a well-written example of people doing the best they can with what they've been given. This is also a cautionary tale of what happens when a society neglects its young."
5,Cyndi Shines Like Star Again With Her New CD!~!!!,"Shine is a great song and I do love the classical feeling inside of it. Cyndi combines POP, ROCK and CLASSICAL in this delicious song. Her voice still strong and even more mature in this work. In my view Cyndi have one of the best voices in the POP Music. The song ""Water's Edge's"" she gives us the same great intrepertation as in ""Time After Time"" one of her best super hits. ""Madonna Whore"" is another great song. She if for sure one of the DANCE QUEENS and Madonna, Cher and others know it. The remix of Shine will make you dance...Cyndi keep shinning for us!!!!!! Buy this CD and you will not be sorry. I do love it!!!!!"
5,"Cyndi Lauper continues to ""SHINE!""","Cyndi Lauper is a true artist and unvailed her latest work of art, ""Shine"" in 2002. Although 'Shine' is an EP (shorter than full albums), it is not short of great song, music, controversy, and artistry. From the uplifting, dynamic single, ""SHINE"" to the lyrically interesting, ""Madonna Whore."" Ms Lauper is one of our most underrated, entertainers of our time, yet consisently delivers beautiful, unique musical results and concert performances......'Shine' is no exception! Buy it Today!PedroCoral Springs, FL"
5,"CYNDI ""SHINES""....AS ALWAYS!!!!","I've been a huge fan of Cyndi's for a long time now. Whether or not the song/cd is a hit doesn't concern me for I know that when i hear/see her in action, I know that I'm in the presence off greatness. No only can she write, sing and perform, but she plays a lot of the instruments. I just recently saw the ""Cher"" concert and have one thing to say: Who's concert was this? Only 1 person that night ""Shined"", I can't believe this true musician hasn't gotten the respect/coverage she more than deserves. I've seen her perfom songs like: Carey (special tv program) WOW!!!, and again on other shows. She always outdoes herself..Cyndi, if you are reading this (highly doubt it--haha) Thank you for all of your heart and spice....Daniel malibu, CA"
4,Very cool!,"I was not aware of this album until a few days ago. I bought it right away. I have always liked Cyndi Lauper, and have always felt that she's been terribly under-rated by all music media.I really like this EP, the title track and ""Waters Edge"" are my favorites."
5,"This new Cyndi Lauper Ep is a heaven shine, simply !","I'm a Cyndi Lauper fan of Santiago de Chile. And I have been waiting for a long time a new Cyndi Lauper CD. I hope that moment come true in brief. For while, I thank to Cyndi this EP, because it's a push to look at the future, for me, thinking in her powerful and beautiful voice. There aren't words to describe ""Shine"" EP. Cyndi, give to your unconditional friends to music with a ""Shine"" CD, please. Thanks for the distance."
3,Appetizer Only,"I purchased this at the concert. While openning for Cher, Cindi Lauper still knows how to rock the house. I had forgotten. While only 10 bucks, it's 4 songs plus remix left me unsatisfied. All the songs are fresh, just not enough of them.If you need to keep your collection complete...go ahead. If you're just rediscovering Cindi, this won't do. I recommend ""Sisters of Avalon"" if you're looking for something gentle, or ""Time After Time"" if you're having trouble remembering why she's in your mind as fun."
5,Great CD,"I love this CD! Cyndi Lauper did it again with a great CD you can sing , Dance and cry to all emotions run wild with this one! Cyndi has a very nice voice much better than some of her Pop rivals . IE Madonna. Cyndi has a Beautiful voice even without the glitz and the electronics that alot of music has these days.I Recommend this CD its a Great addition to your Cyndi Lauper Collection. John Chicago"
5,Cyndi Shines!,"""Shine"" is an awesome up-tempo song that speaks of letting the one you love 'shine' and sticking by their side, and ""Water's Edge"" is a gorgeous, introspective ballad. ""Hard To Be Me"" was written about Anna Nichole Smith, referencing Anna talking about how hard it was to be Anna Nichole during the whole messy trial over the money willed to her by her late husband. Leave it to Cyndi to turn that into an anthem about OUR (not just Anna's) current state of being. Cyndi performs these songs in concert and brings down the house. A real, live, genuine ARTIST doing her thang! BRAVO!!!"
5,what i know,Sinead's new album meets her goals...it gives me such a feeling of peace in this troubled world. I'm not the keenest on religiously-toned music even though i'm religious. Much of what is out there does not touch my heart. This album both touches my heart AND my soul. I feel so relaxed when I pop either disc into the player. I almost want to cry...out of sheer joy.The spirituality is not in your face...and that's much of why it appeals to me so much. Her songs are gorgeous and so tender. Give it...and peace a chance.
2,a triumph of bombast over style,"Seriously, now, who does O'Connor think she is? She writes songs as though she were the next Isiah, born unto the Irish people by way of Jamaica to liberate the tearful from their chains of sorrow.O'Connor's career has always been a struggle between her prodigious musical gifts and her deeply off-putting grandiosity. In this double album, sadly, it is ego inflation which wins the field. The pretty, unremarkable melodies are much too small to form the palanquin for Jehovah that she envisions. A big disappointment."
1,Funerally Boring,"I keep waiting for a new Sinead O'Connor of the same originality and quality as her Lion and Cobra. This certainly isn't it. Every song sounds like a funeral dirge, and worse, every song sounds exactly like every other song. This two disc set will never see the inside of my CD player again. Hated it."
2,Where is Sinead going?,"Sinead O'Connor sings so beautifully. But this isn't a CD I will play very often, because of the strange song selection. I can't help worrying about Sinead and where she is going."
1,"If you like sacchirine adoration psalms, this is for you","It pains me to write this, I am a huge Sinead fan and have been for nearly 20 years. This album is nothing but overly sincere and over the top religious hymns. This album works more as a parody of itself than anything else. I cannot express how bitterly disappointing this album is."
4,Lovely,"I've always been a fan, usually loving 2 or 3 songs from her albums. This one has beautiful music and lyrics in almost every song. I don't know Sinead's religion, but her voice and the Psalms she uses are very moving when paired."
3,Theology,"I purchased this album through Amazon having been blown away by watching ""Something Beautiful"" on youtube.The album comes as both an acoustic and electric version. I much prefer the acoustic side. On the electric side is a version of ""I don't know how to love him' from Jesus Christ Superstar. I do not understand why a singer and songwriter of O'Connor's talent has to include this song.The prologue to the album ""Something Beautiful"" in my opinion is one of the best songs Sinead O'Connor has ever written - I can listen to it over and over again. The lyrics and melody have real depth and soul.The remainder of the album I suspect is very close to O'Connor's heart, but it I find most of the tunes uninspiring."
5,Fun Quote Book,"I really enjoyed this quote book because it had a large number of quotes in it. I wish that the publisher would have allowed the ""search inside"" function, so that you could see what you were getting prior to the purchase, but I definitely enjoyed the quotes inside of this book. If you are looking for a large quote book full of fun little quotes, this one is definitely one of the better ones out there.Enjoy!"
4,Inspiring Funny Thought-provoking,Book is well broken down so you can focus on a specific topic and inspire you in a particular area to make you smile. Many very funny quotes will catch you off guard in the middle of great authors thought-provoking quotes. Good to share with a friend.
2,Just a re-issue without telling you,"This book is nothing more than a reissue of ""Winning Words,"" which was published three years earlier. If you want to get this book cheaply, put ""Winning Words"" in the search box and go buy that one for a penny, plus postage. While I like the content of this book, the fact that I bought it after already owning ""Winning Words"" kind of ticks me off--it's pretty deceptive on the part of the publishers. I'd give the first book five stars for the content, but this one only two because of the deceptive marketing."
1,One fatal mistake,"The dictionary is very good and very useful. I absolutely love it.Recommend it.Having said that, the CD- though very good- only shows how greedy and pathologically overcautious this company Longman is. Who in the world came up with the idea of authenticating the cd once a month? Why can't we just punch in a registration number at the time of installation? Wouldn't this give Longman peace of mind and make us - customers - happy? Why can't they take care of this problem? What would take to bring their attention to such an obvious flawed feature?I lost my CD. You know what that means? I lost my money as well.I don't appreciate that Longman. You should have fixed this problem long time ago. One star you're getting because of that.I hope you read reviews."
3,good content with serious accessibility problems,"I like the dictionary itself and find it complementary to the OED. I bought the product for the software which unfortunately has some problems.I installed the software on my laptop so that I can have a dictionary with me whenever I read. It seems that whenever I try to run the software it is time to validate with the CD. I don't keep my CDs in my laptop bag, so too often I don't get to use the software! They need to rethink this.The other big problem is that the GUI is attractive, but not fully functional. It looks like the user-interface was designed by a graphic artist instead of by a UI designer - pretty, but lacking obvious functionality.I very much hope they redesign the UI and rethink the CD validations."
1,Disappointed,"The dictionary is great. I just wanted to receive the used dictionary with the CD as advertised. Although the item is entitled dictionary with CD, the used copy I received did not include a CD. When I called this fact to the attention of the bookseller and requested that he send a CD, he responded saying he did not have any CD's. (Does that mean that none of the used Longman Dictionaries from this bookseller include CDs?) I chose this particular bookseller, because there was no mention of the CD being missing in the description, whereas other booksellers clearly stated if the CD was missing. I regret not placing an order with the more forthright booksellers."
1,The CD is a total disappointment!,"I purchased this dictionary with the CD 5 app. 5 years ago. The dictionary is, with one word, excellent. But the CD is a total disaster. I am a graduate student, so I use my computer frequently. This means I use the CD much more than the dictionary. I have some scratches on the CD, which means it creates problems when I try to install or authenticate it. Besides, I sent emails to the Longman a few times to replace it. But so far I got no response. I think that is the way how their company works. Needing the CD each month for authentication is truly disgusting. You need to install the CD to someplace in your body, or carry it with your key chain if you are a mobile person."
4,Great addition for a wireless desktop.,"This is a slick keyboard - too bad there's not a dedicated key pad, and it does not elevate very much. The sound countrol and integrated mouse pad are nice.Works well w/ Vista."
1,Less than 1 star,"I have to disagree with all the rave reviews for this product. I am completely dissatisfied with the keyboard. The mouse is very hard to position correctly, the scroll feature works sometimes sometimes not. The biggest problem is the signal drops frequently usually when you are in the middle of something. Distance is not the problem, bringing the keyboard next to the receiver does not restore function. Restoring connection is quite a problem. Sometimes pushing the connect button on the receiver and keyboard will do it, sometimes the computer must be rebooted to restore the connection. Customer support at Logitech said my computer was the problem. I now have a keyboard from Microsoft that works fine."
3,Logitech diNovo Keyboard,"I really like appearance, size and tactile feel of keys and overall layout (esp like no separate number pad on side)What I DONT like is, misleading advertising and descriptions that claimed was lighted keyboard. I was looking for a lighted keyboard for use in very low light situations. Only a few keys and mouse pad are lighted. Very disappointed the the minimal lighting. Why would you light 3 or 4 keys and not the rest. Stupid design decision. Light all or none and then describe it propertly. I am going to be returning my keyboard"
2,Triumph of form over function.,"Read the reviews: ""I can live with the mediocre functionality because it's pretty.""Why put a track-pad on the right side where it is utterly unusable? Probably OK for former DOS users who rarely use a mouse.Buy the cheaper Adesso if you want a trackpad where it is usable, or buy a smaller form-factor wireless keyboard and wireless mouse."
1,Scroll pad doesn't work,"It looks sexy, but it just doesn't work. The scroll pad is so finicky I wanted to throw it out the window after the first hour. About half the time it moves the cursor when you want to scroll, or it scrolls when you want to move the cursor. The other half the time, it does nothing no matter what part of the pad you touch or how hard or lightly you press. Also beware that if you return this just because you're not satisfied with how it works, Amazon will charge you for both outgoing and return postage! (I've giving it one star out of pity, and because it does look sharp.)"
3,"Great feel, not reliable for me","Great key feel, which is the most important thing. However it hasn't been reliable for me. The first keyboard I received had intermittent bluetooth issues, so I got it replaced under warranty. A year or so later that keyboard developed battery issues, where it would only run for a day or less between charges. To Logitech's credit, they did send replacement keyboards under warranty. A buddy who has the same keyboard noted that he finds it doesn't charge every time you put it in the charger... sometimes you have to insert it several times before it actually starts charging. So I'm wondering if my battery issues were maybe charging issues. At any rate, the three year warranty makes these reliability issues less painful, but I still don't like having to send it back so often."
2,Buggy,"In a word this item is ""buggy"" and I gave up trying to figure it out. The connection gets dropped and buffers all key stroked and issues all the strokes when the connection is regained. I gave up and bought from the same brand but different item."
2,Stupid nagging issues for a keyboard this expensive,"The keyboard looks great (from the front). It seems pretty well built too. After reading the reviews, it looked good for HTPC usage. It's not really cut out for HTPC usage though.The problems I have with it are:1) Contantly looses connections from a distance of about 10 ft. I have to cycle the power 2-3 times to get a working connection again. An older RF Logitech wireless keyboard works just fine.2) With the device on it's dock, the computer will not sleep. Part of the allure (for me) for this device in use with a HTPC was to have a handy place the store the keyboard while not in use. Now I have to leave the keyboard lying around if I want the PC to be able to sleep.3) I have no idea why you would take a nice and sleek black/silver design, and put a horrible bright orange all over the back side.If the keyboard was 50$, I would have rated it 3-4 stars. At > 100$ I have a hard time giving it even the 2 stars I did."
5,I love this keyboard,"I have been using an older Logitech keyboard which was larger and a bit long in the tooth but still performed flawlessly. This upgrade was mainly for it's elegance of design and simplicity. The key ""feel"" is perfect as others have testified to, making typing feel precise. The slim profile is very elegant and it is not cluttered with unnecessary buttons that will not be used. I like having the mouse pad which although used infrequently, still it is convenient at times. I love the fact that I can charge it in the stand which eliminates desk clutter while it is charging. Apple has been the leader in industrial design in it's products for a long time. Logitech is one of the companies that ""gets"" it also. I feel this keyboard is overly expensive but still gave it 5 stars because if it fits into your budget it is a joy to look at, use and own. Almost the definition of art. Highly recommended."
2,"Highly disappointing -- Lousy design, overpriced","I've had one of these for about 6 months now, have been using with a media PC hooked up to the TV. I've found this keyboard fairly frustrating.Cons:1. Mouse buttons are poorly designed, of poor quality, difficult to press.2. Touchpad does not work well. No way to disable touch-to-select feature, so frequently end up selecting or moving objects that you didn't intend to.3. Sleep button is in the most illogical possible place. Right along the top edge of the keyboard where most people naturally grab the keyboard. Frequently inadvertently end up putting PC to sleep.4. Same goes for Bluetooth re-sync button. It's right along the middle top edge of the keyboard. Again, frequently end up accidently putting the keyboard in re-sync mode when picking it up. This requires logging into windows, starting the Bluetooth pairing utility and re-pairing the keyboard.Highly disappointed with this keyboard."
5,Best wireless keyboard I've ever seen.,"This keyboard is the best wireless keyboard I've ever seen. It is beautiful to look at, the battery lasts forever, and it is easy to use.I am using it with a home theater PC running Snapstream's Beyond Media and BeyondTV. It works great, I have not had to install any drivers and it still does everything I need.I'm glad I spent the extra money. This keyboard is absolutely perfect for use with an HTPC."
3,"disconecting from usb adapter,anoying","pros: stylish, nice looking small for htpccons: disconects from pc. most of the time cursor pad lags"
3,"Great product, Some quirks","First of all as most people have said, this is a good looking, easy to use product. Have aSony Bravia W-Series KDL-40W3000, with a 40inch 1080p HDTV screen. I have a Dell XPS 1530 laptop which has a dedicated graphics card and 4gb memory connected to it thru hdmi. Beautiful full screen picture! I needed a good way to control the desktop and even though this keyboard is overpriced, it is nearly worth it.Pros:-easy bluetooth connection.-great battery life.Cons:-The touchpad to control the cursor sometimes freezes. Not sure what the issue is. It comes back on within a few seconds but this can be irritating.-Expensive. May have been worth it if it did not have the above issue.I still gave it 3 stars becuase it is good in other aspects. I would have preferred if it had come with a trackball instead. This would have made controlling the cursor much easier."
2,Poor quality control,"I finally purchased this keyboard because of the good price after rebate. Unfortunately, after about 5 minutes of use the product failed. I fully charged the unit before use, and installed the software before using it. After about 3 minutes of use, the keyboard started turning off by itself. It would turn on when I clicked on the left mouse button, but turn off again. When I placed the unit on my lap, it kept turning off and on every second. Tried many times to troubleshoot. Now the battery light is flashing red when it's on the base. It does work when it's sitting in the base, but what good is that?? I did notice a little dent on the touchpad. A keyboard this expensive should have better quality control. I also feel that the keyboard could be packaged a bit better. The keyboard should be in the middle of the box, instead of being on top. Not too much protection for the keyboard, other than the box lid. [...]"
3,"Good, but not perfect","Keyboard has great feel and nice design. The programmable functions are nice. The only drawback is the mouse pad. It is not something you will want to use a lot. Sensitivity is not intuitive and it will frustrate you with extensive use. If you are buying this keyboard because you don't want to use a separate mouse anymore, you will be disappointed."
3,Watch-out 64 bit Vista users,"This is a great keyboard with some interesting features. Among them the attempt to do away with the need for a mouse with a multifunctional keypad and a left click button on the left of the keyboard. BUT, it is not fully functional if you are using 64 bit Vista. Specifically, the scroll left/right function will not work, despite the up/down scroll being fine. A Logitech tech and I discovered this by testing on another keyboard. There may be other 64 bit glitches I have not found yet. But not enough to stop me from finding it to be a very nice keyboard. But all OEMs should make their equipment fully 64 bit compatible because the profile is mainstream now."
4,Excellent keyboard,"If you have an HTPC then this keyboard is a must. It works beautifully, the bluetooth works great and best of all it just looks damn beautiful. Many folks have commented on how great it looks. For a normal desktop setup it's still great. The keys feel just right as you type on them. This doesn't have a keypad though which should be noted for basic desktop use.The mouse or trackpad is the one thing that I hope to see improvement on for future iterations of this product. I can't complain too much because as of now I think this is the best mouse-keyboard combination on the market it's just that the trackpad (especially the scrolling) is not as much of a joy to use as the keyboard. This is the only reason I gave it a 4 star. I wanted to give it a 4.5 star cause this thing is almost perfect.All in all if you need a wireless keyboard and the lack of a keypad is not an issue for you then get this."
5,great product,Another high quality product of logitech!The keyboard works from a high distance and it looks amazing!I bought this one for my brother but i plan on getting one for myself aswell
1,"Flawed quality, buyer beware","I like the design of the keyboard, as I have most Logitech products. But the Dinovo edge I purchased wouldn't charge. This appears to be a fairly common issue [...]. Unfortuneately, by the time i realized it wasn't charging, the 30 day return period had expired. Now I have a bricked keyboard. Not recommended."
4,Great Keyboard But Keys Can Pop Out!,"I have now bought three of these keyboards in the past three years. Overall, they work wonderfully well. For me battery life has been outstanding - going for 2-3 weeks of daily use w/o recharge. Wireless connection is pretty faultless too - only very occasional disconnects once in a blue moon. It's also very slim - good in my tight office space! In fact it does everything you could possibly want a good keyboard to do....except one thing that's very irritating... the thin plastic tops of the keys with the letters written on them have a tendency to pop out if tapped hard and sharply. Once they are out, it's virtually impossible to clip them back in again. So you end up buying a new keyboard! Somebody should tell Logitech to improve the design so that either the tops of the keys don't pop out, or they can be clipped back in easily."
1,Buyer Beware,"The trackpad is pathetic. The ONLY marketing point for the purchase.THIS DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN ILLUMINATED KEYBOARD, REGARDLESS OF THE HOT KEYS. Battery Status key does not light or display at all. Must study keyboard with light at just the right angle to determine that it ALWAYS DISPLAYS a HALF-CHARGE.Click keys and the trackpad are frustrating. The specialty scroll only worked vertically.Design is pretty, Bluetooth is nice. But that just isn't even close to enough to justify the cost.Ergonomically: something is VERY wrong, my left hand is suffering from overuse of the left click button after two weeks.If you rarely need the mouse, it would be just peachy."
2,"Over two years and no problems, third year battery was dead.","I never thought I would love such a keyboard, but with hdmi from pc to tv, this keyboard is a dream come true. For most people the only room for improvement would be a numeric keyboard. I don't remember paying so much for mine, I saw it recently for $160.00. Don't get me wrong, it is worth it to me, but that price could make most think twice. The only great improvement would have been using AA NiMH batteries instead of built in non replaceable."
4,Revision Teclado Logitech diNovo Edge,The keyboard is easy to use and it can be used from a long distance. The problem is that some times it loose the signal.The battery life is realy good and fast to charge again!!
2,Expencive and no number pad!,"For [...] bucks I would expect a number pad. The keyboard is nice looking, the keys are comfortable and it is over all very stylish but not worth the asking price."
4,Nice touch,"I am very happy with my new diNovo Edge Keyboard. Since I am a former classical pianist, I am very sensitive to the keyboard action, and this is what I like most about this product. It takes very little movement to depress the keys, and the action is even and smooth. However, I have owned this keyboard for about a month, and am still getting used to the slight change in spacing from my prior IBM keyboard (especially the onces that require reaching with my pinky), so I am making a lot of mistakes."
2,Setup Is A Pain....,"Nice looking product, looks like it smudges very easily though. I am a tech and surprised at what a pain the setup is. I will update this review once I start using the product. For now, first impression is that this is worth half what I paid."
4,The Best Keyboard ever! only 1 CON....,PROS:ElegantBeautifull!Super SlimLithium rechargable batteryTouchpad mouseFine details and qualityHigh bluetooth range!CONSLack of NUM PAD... (& high price)
3,DiNovo Three,"Great product, with reservations. Bluetooth works well, great ergonomics and feel. Beautiful to look at, But features are flawed. The touch screen does not function, lights up, but does not work. Can not find a solution. I am using Windows 7 Ultimate with 8 gigs ram. Also i had to disable sleep mode, computer would not return to operation after sleep mode, required reboot.This is my third DiNovo and will be going back if Logitech support doesnt provide answers."
1,STAY AWAY...good looking piece of junk.,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCTI was very happy with it at the beginning but after 6 months I was left with a stylish and expensive piece of junk. It refuses to charge and Logitech tells me that the battery is not replaceable.
2,"100% Un-Green, Landfill in one year","Besides the out of control fluctuating volume, (which happens on its own intermittently and, after much figuring , seems to be set off by bright light hitting the volume control slide), this keyboard worked pretty well. But after a year the Dinovo Edge would no longer hold a charge. A web search revealed that this is an ongoing problem. There seems to be no way to replace the battery... and it becomes useless fairly quickly. Contacting support is difficult and no answers were provided. The Logitech support forum has several entries on this issue with zero answers. That's really shameful that this thing, which contains many toxic elements, must be thrown in the garbage after a year!"
4,Logitech diNovo Edge ( 967685-0403 ),"Sleek keyboard. Quiet, but haven not found a ""silent"" keyboard yet. Good ergonomics, nice features; e.g., touchpad, function keys. Charging stand is convenient."
3,Left Mouse Button Gets Glitchy,"I really really love this keyboard and I wish it worked 100% perfectly, but it doesn't.The reason I bought it is so that I can use my computer from my lazy-boy recliner (super couch potatoing) wirelessly and not have to worry about where to place the mouse. It does this great, the integrated trackpad takes a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it's great for controlling the mouse and scrolling.Only problem I have is that the left mouse click button keeps losing it's identity and likes to re-assign itself as a ""half click"" or sometimes as ""right click"" even though the settings in the Logitech control panel are set for ""left click"". There is an alternate left click button on the left edge of the keyboard which I use when this happens, or tapping the trackpad also acts as a left click. I haven't found a solution for the left button issue yet, so that's my work around. That is why I rated 3 stars instead of 5."
2,"looks nice, performs poorly","Add poor quality of the manufacture of this keyboard to the cons:The Delete key started loosening after a few days, almost at the same time as the rather nifty touch-control for sound started living its own life, leaving music hovering from the meek to the deafening within seconds.This in addition to the other pros (good design, good key touch) and cons (no numeric keyboard, uncommon key layout).Definitively not the best product Logitech ever produced and well below what one might expect."
4,Better than I expected,"I've always been scared of ordering things online but it arrived exactly as stated and I saved about 50 bucks by ordering it online rather than just going to Bestbuy. I love how thin it is and how it types so softly and smooth. How everyone's already mentioned, the only negative I see in it is that it doesn't have a number keyboard to the side but then again it looks super cool on my desk. It makes my office look like a space shuttle. Definitely worth the money. Would've even paid $200 for it but that's just the utility I have gotten from it."
2,Awesome with one Fatal Flaw,"I would have given this 5 stars in a heart beat, but right before writing this review i went to get something off my keyboard and learned that this thing has no protection.. with just my fingernail i permanently ruined my keyboard. This thing catches scratches, makes them look deep and stick out... Total Failure on a keyboards part. now there is no point of having a fancy display stand or anything of the sort!"
4,Unusual Delete Key,"Before I purchased this keyboard I read some of the reviews, and remembered at least one reviewer complaining about the oversized delete key. At the time I thought this was inconsequential. Not so.As you can see from the photos, the delete key is larger than the enter key. On all other keyboards I've used it's the opposite.I've used the Edge for about a month now, everday at the office. I still routinely hit the delete key when I really want enter, and vice versa. Perhaps one day I'll adapt, but for now it's annoying.The only other problem I've had is that on occasion the mouse pointer will stick momentarially. Other than that it's worked quite well."
4,"""Almost"" perfect!","Pros:-Setup is extremely simple: just plug in the USB dongle.-Keyboard and mouse pad work flawlessly.Cons:-The scroll function does not work well.I connect my big screen TV to a PC. This keyboard is ""almost"" perfect for operating the PC from my recliner."
5,Great Keyboard for Macbook Pro,"I had been looking for a keyboard for the Macbook Pro for quite awhile and even though they don't list the keyboard as being Mac compatible - it is, at least it is for the Macbook Pro 17"". It so far has been working great - just what I've been looking for."
4,New Keyboard,"This keyboard is all around awesome. First thing I bought for my new computer build since it also worked very well currently. The bluetooth is great had trouble with it at first having to reconnect but works fine now. Has controls for everything amd some programmable keys. Mouse pad is good would be tough if a lot of mouse movement is required. Its light, small, good buttons, wish a backlight was blue not orange. Other then that, love this keyboard."
4,Logitech diNovo Edge,"This keyboard is by far the best one I have ever used. I got it to use with my computer, which serves as our entertament center. If I could afford it, I would by another to use at work for regualar typing. The feel of the keys are great.It works well for media control also. It is kind of anoying that you have to press the function key, and hold, to use the multimedia keys. I would have much preferred stand-alone funtion keys. It would also be nice if you could toggle the funtion key instead of having to hold it down.The touch disk works well for me. While not super fast, it does the job. It would have been nice if they had located it bottom center, like on laptops rather than off to the side. This is not a big deal, and it does keep you from tapping it while typing. The volume control works great, and is kind of fun. volume buttons would have worked just as well, but were would the fun be?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!,"I'll get to the point, you cannot disable the tap option on this touchpad (very sensitive)...This leads to many problems, like clicking on things you don't mean or want (ridiculous)...Customer support didn't help at all...They should have done the right thing, and advertised this at least on the box (""Note: Tap option cannot be disabled"")..."
1,Second keyboard failed after a month,"Keyboard looks and works very good for home theater PC but not for long.First one failed within couple month. Just would not charge anymore flashing red. Got a replacement keyboard from Logitech. The process was very awkward since I had to ship keyboard or some part of it back to them first. Only then they would ship a replacement. The replacement keyboard failed with the same symptoms after a month. Now I sent it back and waiting for the third! one.Pros: Sexy, integrated touch pad.Cons: Unreliable, Overpriced."
4,Not a revolutionary keyboard,"The keys on this keyboard are relatively silent, with a slightly springy feeling, softer than regular keyboards, stiffer than a laptop keyboard. Typing on it is very smooth, and though I find the touchpad not as responsive as I would like it (even after adjusting the sensitivity, but that may be because navigating on the mouse is smoother), I find it very useful on my home theater setup (tv/computer monitor setup) and rarely use my mouse anymore. After getting use to the keyboard, it is a must for a home theater setup. The only thing lacking is a keypad for numbers. If you can afford it, it is a nice keyboard, but if your budget is a little tight, its not a must have revolutionary product."
5,Amazing Keyboard!,"This keyboard is great. Plug n Play is great, the orange glow of function keys fade in and out smoothly and the keys feel very responsive. The touchpad and volume scroll features are great. i haven't even installed the setpoint software so I can't wait to see what other great features the board has."
1,Unimaginably incompetent design,"One of the biggest drawbacks to a laptop keyboard is the lack of a number pad. How can you manufacture a separate keyboard and not include one? Utterly insipid. If it had a keypad, I would give it the highest rating."
4,Logitech diNovo Edge review,"The first one that I received started working as soon as I plugged in the USB bluetooth receiver and all functionas worked except the touchpad disc. After troubleshooting online with Logitech, we determined that this was defective. I received another one at blazing speeds both due to the excellent Logitech support as well as incredible return policy which made it a pleasure to work with Amazon. The second keyboard works flawlessly. Absolutley a piece of art."
4,great keyboard no numpad,"The battery life is stellar, the stand is stylish, the keyboard is THIN. An unexpected surprise is the built in mouse, which ends up being really useful for HTC. My only complaint is the lack of the numpad, which I use more than I realized."
4,Leave it flat.,"The product is quite sleek, so sleek that it takes getting used to.After using it in the tilted position, I decided to leave it flat and it is much more satisfying to use that way. Its actually much more comfortable. The only thing is it seems like it should be alittle larger. The ultra flat surface, which is great is on the one hand a great design quality. On the other hand this same quality seems to demand an expanded wider surface, with slightly larger buttons. I think that would be a significant ergonomic enhancement.Other than that its near perfect."
3,"A for product, c for effort","so the product got here on time, had a suprisingly large amount of charge already on it compared to other blutooth items ive purchased and works wondefully so far.The downside was that, there are a few dings and scraped on the package frsh out of the box. While, its not something im going to send the product back over, and its on the edges, not on the surface or anything like that, I'm just a little upset when a product comes with cosmetic defections right out of the box. Someone at Logitech probably needs to make sure their employees in charge of this type of thing should be doing their job a little bit better"
3,Connectivity issues render this thing useless.,"I have persisted with the Mac version of this keyboard for well over three years - to the point of purchasing several for various machines (and stored for future use) but today I resigned myself to the fact that the keyboard has a couple of major flaws that render it useless to me.Firstly, the well documented connectivity issue - at least 2-3 times a day I would loose connection and have to re-start the keyboard to gain productivity. At this price point, this is simply not on.Secondly, I've had two units in 12 months which have stopped responding to the charger - again, rendering them useless (i.e. no charge). This is another well-documented issue with this particular keyboard - both Mac and PC.So, now I've gone back to the Apple wireless keyboard. Not quite as sexy or as nice to type on, but at least it is reliable and offers value for money."
2,Great wireless keyboard,"Works great with my HTPC, easy to navigate ,lightweight, long battery life. Only thing missing is back lighting in keyboardUPDATE This was a great keyboard until the connectivity issue started and the mouse starting freezing and the letters works when it wants to which is not when I want it too. for the price I am very disappointed time to return and keep looking"
1,Blue Tooth unreliable,The blue tooth connection is very unreliable when syncing to my laptop running Windows 7. This problem seems pervasive when I Googled it. Interestingly Logitech Tech Support is clueless about the problem.Keyboard has a nice feel but it's useless to me if it keeps dropping it's connection.Also space bar has gotten a little squeaky.
2,Bad impractical keyboard,An overpriced keyboad. Good looking definitely but impractical. No indicator for the caps lock. What was logitech thinking. So if you sit at the keyboard after a while there is no way to tell without typing if the caps lock is (accidentally) on.Keystrokes do not feel all that great also.Besides the funky scroll bar etc might be somewhat useful with proper drivers for a Windows only PC but not for a professional keyboard which serves Linux and Windows etc.Trying to put in Mouse keys on the leyboard is a joke. One still needs the mouse actually as a proper touchpad is missing.And who wants to keep their keyboards in a stand when not in use.Lookswise it is very good. Functionality wise it is a dud.
1,Love this keyboard - Hate it doesn't last,"This is my second try at this keyboard and probably my last. Everything functions fine but the paint on the a,s,o,i,t,e,m,n wore out in a little over a year. It may be I type too hard but at $150+ each time I'm done.EDIT: The second keyboard lasted about a year with similar results plus a few other problems. I am so done with these keyboards!"
1,One fatal flaw makes a near perfect product useless,One critical failure on Logitech's part makes a near perfect keyboard useless. You cannot disable the double-click feature on the touchpad - and the touchpad is very sensitive. As a result you end up frequently double-clicking when you don't intend to. Had to return mine as a result.If you look on the Logitech support board you'll see many posts about this issue. Logitech says it is a hardware limitation so don't count on a software fix.Very disappointing that Logitech Product Management didn't get it right on a critical feature.Recommmendation - look elsewhere or wait until Logitech fixes this problem in a new version of the hardware.
5,Great wireless keyboard,"using as part of a PCHTC. PC located about 30 feet away, in a closet. Bluetooth works beautifully. occasional touch pad freeze that releases within about 30 seconds, otherwise very smooth, responsive, etc... feels intuitive. there is no DEL key."
5,Wireless Keyboarad,"Delivered earlier than I expected.Works as advertised.Mouse click on the upper left side of keyboard is great.I bought it to use on my 58"" Samsung Plasma.I hook up my laptop to the tv and insert the blue tooth into the usb and it runs immediately.However ist not as practical as I had hoped. Being 15 feet away from the screen for e-mail and everyday net surfing isnt that great.I will persevere however because I think the technolgy is awsome.My 3 year old grandaughter loves calling up MS Word, putting the font on 72, increasing the size to 200%, puting the caps lock on and making giant letters on the big screen."
4,Touchdisc can be defective - Logitech knows about it,"I purchased this keyboard around the 3rd week of October 2010. Everything worked great, EXCEPT the Touchdisc, which was defective. I had the same problem as others - it just wouldn't respond unless you pressed down extremely hard, and would then barely budge on the screen.I called Logitech, and after giving them the codes off the bottom of the keyboard, they stated that this is a known defect. Logitech emailed me a UPS return label, and as soon as I shipped the defective keyboard, they had a new keyboard sent to me.Otherwise, it's a great keyboard! I'm using it with a HTPC."
3,Great KeyBoard But save your receipt because of bad rechargable battery,"Ok so when I first got this keyboard I loved it. Typing on the diNovo Edge felt so comfortable and super quiet. The battery life was incredible. 15 minutes of charging and the battery can last days on end. Except 3 months after buying I noticed teh charge was not holding. If I charged all night it would go dead after a days useage. Then it got worse and worse where I would charge it for hours only to get 1/2 hour of charge. The mouse worked ok, but the keyboard just dies. This seems to have happened to many people and Logitec will replace it just make sure to keep your proof of purchase and even the packaging as well."
5,I love this keyboard!,"I bought this keyboard to replace an RF keyboard that I was using with my Home Theater PC. I moved my WiFi router from another room and put it behind my HTPC. I started having problems because the WiFi signal interfered with the keyboard signals.So I bought this gem. It uses Bluetooth, so I don't have interference from the WiFi, it is beautiful and looks great sitting in its charging cradle in my Living Room, and it works great! The keys have a solid, firm action. It is a quality product. The round trackpad takes some getting used to at first, but once you get the hang of it, no problem. I also like that it has a separate left-click button that you can actuate with your left hand while using the trackpad with your right. It's a little pricey, but worth every penny."
2,NOT BACKLIT!!! Very misleading!,"It's a very nice looking and feeling keyboard, but reading the description it sounds like it's a backlit keyboard. Only after receiving it did I realise it's only the additional controls that have backlighting! What's the point in backlighting a few controls, but leaving the KEYS on a KEYBOARD unlit?!!! This is in the ""backlit"" catagory in the Amazon search, which is VERY misleading!! Combined with the non-replaceable battery that many report going bad very quickly and I'm considering returning this keyboard."
1,Defective touchdisc - Watch out!,"First one I got had a bad touchdisc. It didnt respond to my finger unless you press extremely hard (and then it would move maybe an inch). I did an RMA with Amazon and the second one I recieved today has the same defect! I have worked with logitech support because I thought for sure it couldnt be possible both were bad.... They are. I saw another reviewer on here with the same problem.... Amazon, maybe logitech sent you a bad batch here. I'm gonna call for a second RMA tomorrow. Very annoyed.Additionally, I tried purchasing this same items for a different vender and had the same problem. Anyone considerign purchasing this should look at the latest reviews on newegg.com as well. You will see many reports like mine."
3,"Cool, but having some Issues.","I use this product for my home theater media computer. For a home theater, I haven't seen a better keyboard. Unfortunately, its not perfect. The problems are that Windows XP and Bluetooth don't play nicely. When your computer is struggling with programs, that will affect Bluetooth mouse connectivity. This would not happen with a traditional mouse. Additionally, the touchpad is only ok. Its about as good as a standard laptop touchpad, but slightly smaller. I have also struggled with dropped connections. Its easy to solve - just turn off and on the keyboard - but its still annoying. These issues and the price tag make this product only average, when it could be great."
5,Absolutely love it!,"This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. With its Bluetooth capability, I had this keyboard working on my laptop within two minutes...needless to mention it is wireless...I cannot stand wires needles to say when you have to trace them to your pc/laptop. I highly recommend this keyboard to anyone who cannot stand wires like myself. Also, the fingerboard on it can be used to replace your mouse. It takes a little getting used to at first."
1,"Great look, not reliable","I use this keyboard for my Home Media Center. I needed a keyboard with a keypad so I bought a Logitech since I have very good experience with other devices. However this keyboard caused me more trouble than any other gadget I have had. First, the unit I first used had some sync problems, but Logitech exchanged me with another one. After using some time, it started with some battery issues, it does not charge anymore and the battery indicator does not surpasses 10%, so I have only 15 minutes of use before charging again. This time, Logitech support is not responding my questions, so I am very upset with their service."
1,died after 5 months,"This is an editted review. I loved it at first but 5 months after purchaseit refuses to charge. Going back and forth with Logitech at the moment butshould not have this problem on this price keyboard. From searching aroundI now find I am not alone. The battery is not replaceable....OLD REVIEW:I know it hurts to spend so much on a keyboard, but when you tire of thenormal wireless mice and keyboards not having enough range foryour home theatre setup, this is the only choice. I don't care how'beautiful' it is. It works as promised, great range, great battery."
5,Invisible in use.,"Yes, it seems overpriced and yes, it doesn't have a numeric keypad. BUT...I've used a lot of keyboards and this one has the best feel of any. It never has keys that stick or don't register when I press. If you want a keyboard that is invisible in use - that you can just forget about (except for an occasional charge) - this is the one. I use it in conjunction with a Logitech wireless trackball and I couldn't ask for more. I'm ready to purchase a second one and there is no question about it. I'd give it more stars if I could!Addendum: I've had the keyboard for three years now and it is still far and away the best keyboard I've ever used. It is as close to being invisible as I could imagine a keyboard to be. Unfortunately, Logitech has discontinued the diNovo edge and nothing has come along to take its place. While it is nearly invisible in use, it paradoxically looks great!"
5,I Love Technology,Especially wireless technology. How wonderful to be dancing on the other side of the room and surfing at the same time!
2,It misses on the fundamentals ... keys don't work and connection breaks,"I am very frustrated with this keyboard. Some of the keys just quite working. It looks nice, but I would rather have it work. It does not have a numberic pad which is frstrating if you use ALT keys. I need to unplug the adaptor and replug it every time I startup my computer.Overall, I am sorry I bought it and even more so that I bought two of them."
3,Underimpressed,"The key board is OK - nothing special worth that amount of money. The biggest drawback is the ""mouse"". It is so small so as to make it useless and I still use my regular mouse anyway. The feel of the keyboard is good (although it arrived with one key off). I had trouble making the software work with my previous Logitech devices already installed. Since neither keyboard showed up in the software, I had to uninstall it but it wouldn't take both of them, which it should be able to do. The look is nice and charging unique. So it's OK but nothing that special nor worth that price."
3,not really the most advanced keyboard... but an OK one,"my dream keyboard with budget over $100 must have this:1. solar powered2. back lit capable3. stylish and thin (like this one)4. ease and reliable of connection5. better productivity (lack of number keypad is definitely not helping)6. fun to use: dedicated keys for multimedia (this one, you have to use Fn + sth combo)the trackpad sucks,considering that this keyboard was introduced to the market more than 4 years ago, you might accept all the shortcomings. If I had done more research, I would not buy this keyboard. It was an impulsive buy for me."
2,Loses Connection Too Often Necessitating Reboot,"The keyboard is slick and sexy but man it loses its connection with the computer too often for comfort ... and when this happens, you need to reboot the PC which basically means you lose all your unsaved work"
3,"Great Keyboard, Till You Must Charge","This keyboard performs well. I haven't explored all the features, but the basics are as expected.I'm thrilled to have a rechargeable keyboard, but completely appalled with the clunky charging stand that doesn't allow typing while charging and large AC adapter taking up another outlet. This product would have been much, much better had they done away with the charger, and instead recharged via USB like so many other electronic devices. The keyboard would then double as a USB keyboard for those situations when Bluetooth gives you trouble.So disappointed to see a product shipped with this dated thinking."
1,serious connectivity issues,"Its a nice keyboard and all that. The problem is that sooner or later, the bluetooth connection will start acting up requiring you to ""reset"" the connection. I have given up on it."
4,"Purchased for use with PS3, works well.","Took it out of the box, hit connect, fired up the PS3, went to Accessories > Manage Bluetooth Devices > Register Device. PS3 immediately recognized the keyboard and easily paired. F1, F3, F5 are your important keys when navigating through the browser.The only thing I'm upset about is that it had an ugly black smudge in the center of the palm rest right out of the package! (picture to follow) It's small but very noticedable. I don't know if this is an Amazon or Logitech issue but I'm willing to live with it if the keyboard continues to have no functional issues.Haven't paired with my Netbook yet - standby for more."
5,Best Wireless Keyboard Ever,"The diNovo Edge is a bit on the expensive side, but it is a great keyboard with lots of useful features. No connection issues, so I have nothing but good things to say about it!"
5,"don,t miss this one","trust me anything laid down at the conscious sounds studio is top draw ,wicked dub album .also check out dubs from the vaults (conscious sounds)"
4,Not as good as Somewhere In Time but still good.,"Some good songs, a few so-so songs. Kind of reminds me of the Piece of Mind and Powerslave album but with less gallop. What else is there to say? DoD is a really good tune, epic. The record is worth a listen."
5,Classic Metal Madness.. with PURE Substance,"WOW... how can I describe IM's new album- Dance Of Death . For me it's their best in more than a decade. The outstanding songs in this album are Paschendale, Montsegur,Journeyman,Dance of Death,Rainmaker and the first single ""wildest Dreams""In all, after you hear the album for the 1st time, these are the emotions u get from the beast's songs...dark, melodic, uniqueness, strangeness etc. I didnt expect much but I got more than I deserve.The 3 man army of guitar assault never fails to blow your mind away. All this maturity in their music have made thier 13th Album a REAL jaw dropper. Bruce's vocals or rather air raid warnings just takes u to another level of doom.In conclusion, you MUST BUY this album to see what Heavy Metal is all about or you will die a sore loser....up the irons.Cheers..."
5,GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!,"If you are a true Maiden fan like me than you need to get this album now! Iron Maiden is like fine wine, they just get better with age. This album contains everything on it to be a great album, killer riffs, harmonies, melodies and of course great singing. And the best thing about this album is that it came out on my birthday and it was an awesome birthday present indeed! So dont waste any time and do yourself a favor GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!! UP THE IRONS"
2,Time to Quit,"If Iron Maiden is the only band you listen to, and you worship them like the 'emperor's new clothes' then you will love this album. However, if you are intelligent you should be able to realize that there's nothing special here. Just another cookie-cutter Maiden album. It's basically just as good as BRAVE NEW WORLD, except now the excitement has worn off that Bruce is back.'Rainmaker' is an OK song, except the German band Vanden Plas put out a song with the same name on their album, THE GOD THING. The Vanden Plas song is much better. The title track is also worthy of being played at concerts, but the band is pretty much running on vapors at this point. I don't understand why they don't get rid of Janick Gers and start putting out the kind of music we hear on Bruce's solo records. Is Steve Harris's ego really that big?I don't even know why I bought this."
2,waste of money!!!,"What a joke.I was waiting 3 years for the new album and what a disappointment it turned out to be. Bruce has lost his voice, probably from too much touring after Brave New World. Brave New World is an excellent album - a true comeback. Dance with Death is not even close to be in the same league.There are five albums with 5 stars: Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, 7 Son of the 7 Son and Brave New World."
3,"If I don't like it, I am not a Maiden fan?",That is the dumbest thing I ever heard! Worshiping every single note from a band or artist is scarey. Doesn't make you a fan it makes you a fanatic! Every band has peeks and valleys. Maiden is a prime example of this. This album is ok at best and guess what......I am a Maiden fan. Will I be be-headed now? This is a free country and everyone has freewill and tastes. This is why I read reviews. To get people's opinions!
5,F-I-N-A-L-L-Y!,"Finally, Maiden come out with an album that surpasses 7th Sun and takes it's rightful place where Piece of Mind left off 20 years ago. With exception of weaker tracks Dance of Death, Face In The Sand & Journeyman, the listener is left with 8 tracks that match the best of the band's original sound. ""Rainmaker"" is the springboard of the release, surpassing ""Wasted Years"" as the band's most sing-along anthem. ""New Frontier"" and ""Paschendale"" revel in their brilliance, even taking the listener back to the Killers/Beast sound with both songs' heavier passages. ""No More Lies"" has Harris finally getting the reflective look at life and possibility of being reborn lyrics right with a crushing groove, to boot. ""Age Of Innocence"" and ""Montsegur"" cement DOD's cannon, which of course begins with the wonderful time-waster ""Wildest Dreams""After a lackluster, overly-melodic last three studio efforts, Maiden proves they've got the goods 25 years later...."
3,PowerSlave,"im a pretty big maiden fan...this is now my 15th maiden album...prob no.10th in ranking...its a good album...not their best...paschendale is the only 5/5...i enjoyed dance of death and face in the sand too...the rest are ok but dont stick in your head...one of the best guitar albums tho..brilliant solos...some of their best in fact...thumbs up to adrian on this one for paschendale tho...love that song.......if u enjoyed the heavier maiden...this aint for u...not a fast album like powerslave...i give wildest dreams a 2/10...pretty lollipop song lol,rainmaker a 5/10no more lies 4/10montsegur 6.5/10dance of death 8.5/10gates of tommorow 6/10new frontier 6.5/10pashendale 10/10face in the sand 8/10age of innocence 7.5/10journeyman 5.5/10this is only my rating ppl...it differs to everyone i guess"
2,"Please, use your imagination more with next album!","This album don't offer nothing new and tricks have heard before. Hardcore fans will buy this but if you are a quality kwowledge Maiden music listener, you won't necessarely need this album. There some fine moments and some bad moments. You will boored soon for this Dance od Death. Spare your money and wish that Maiden will do next time something fresh and unheard material."
2,Far from their best work,"Ok it's Maiden so there are going to be some good bits - but what a step backward from BNW, (which I would see as a 3.5 star album). Some of the choruses are plain awful - 'No more Liiiieeeees' repeated ad nauseum is just one example. And the cover art is easily the worst of any Iron Maiden album...by far. I seriously think there is one good album in this album and 'A Matter of Life and Death'. Bruce's voice is increasingly being lost in these muddy mixes too. Time for a rethink Mr. Harris."
4,Dance of Death,"Dance of Death being Iron Maiden's 13th studio album and their 2003 release is a back to basics Heavy Metal album with a rough metal sound and longer tracks which is very similair to early Metallica in that songs are often more then 5 minutes long. All the lyrics are included and we also get many nice photos of the band in group and in individual shots. Unfortunately no list of whom plays what is included. Allmusic and Sputnikmusic gave the album 4/5 and I agree. The best tracks on this release are ""Wildest Dreams"" and ""Rainmaker"". 4/5."
1,I am a Maiden fan and I am not impressed.,"In a nutshell, the new Maiden CD is not very good. Yes there are some catchy songs and decent riffs, but overall the album is not anywhere up to Maiden standards. I am a Maiden fan and have seen the 5x in concert and have never been dissappointed. But this release needs to be picked up in the bargain bin."
1,The Dance of Dull,"Give me a break! I was in seventh grade when I road my bike to Buzzard's Nest Records in Columbus, Ohio to buy Piece of Mind. Iron Maiden was incredibly awesome in their day. However, that day has long since gone. This album is entirely stale. Even my hero Bruce Dickinson sounds tired, especially compared to his brilliant Chemical Wedding, which was only a couple of years ago. There's just something about heavy metal bands: when they get old, the magic goes and they get stale. They should have retired years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years ago!"
2,NOT THAT GOOD,"Big Maiden fan! But this stinks! I saw them live this last year and Bruce sang great, But everything about this new cd is Lame!! and Cheezy!! Wow I want the old sounding Maiden back! Get the new Iced Earth if you want some good ol Metal!"
2,Yet another slow Maiden record ....,"ANY band that has lasted 30+ years will have some good albums and some weak ones. Dance of Death is not bad; it is just a very, very, VERY weak effort. All the songs are weak and slow. And the album (which I have listened to over and over again) never really picks up.. before you know it, you have reached the last song.It is really a disappointment. ""Brand New World"" was just okay. Dance of Death is filled with slow songs that are incredibly forgettable. There is nothing powerful or special about it. It's not that Dance of Death is a BAD album; it is just very weak. There is nothing really interesting other than the last track Journeyman with its different acoustic vibe.Being a fan of Iron Maiden since the ""Killers"" album I always await a new Maiden album with great anticipation. It is great to see this amazing band still making records and touring. But Dance of Death is a very weak effort. But don't take my word for it. Listen to it yourself and judge.."
1,Weak,"I understand every band has sepford fans, but maidens is the worst. anyone who thinks dance of death stands up to powerslave, or piece of mind is a true stepford!.....Even maiden themselves say their heyday was the 80's."
2,Gak,"If it weren't Maiden, it would be one star, believe me. I have been listening to Maiden since the first album came out, learned to play bass listening to Steve Harris. I love the band.This is just awful. Nothing, but nothing inspires me on this album at all. It's not worth delving into details about the specific reasons I don't like this album; it's just boring."
1,Maiden lost,"The last fun song Maiden wrote was Holy Smoke on No Prayer for the Dying. Their albums in the 80's were fun. All songs sounded differently and you could sing along and enjoy the whole album. This album is boring. Theres no great melodic chorus to enjoy like Can I play with Madness, and theres no triplet beats like The Trooper or Somewhere in Time. Sad to say, but maybe theyve exhausted their creative effort."
1,"Named after Janick's stage antics, perhaps???","More overblown, pseudo-cerebral garbage from the Sergeant Major, with those terribly repetitive choruses. That's how you know it's a Steve Harris song: by how the chorus repeats several useless times. And it's even Co-produced by none other than Steve Harris! Hey, when is Steve going to start doing the cover art as well? HIS band can sure use help in that department, as the cover art has been getting worse and worse as time goes on. Unfortunately, there are still a whole lot of sheep out there that'll trick themselves into thinking this is great stuff; that have been so brainwashed by the gimmicks and hype that anything put in front of them is greedily consumed. But until something's done about that worn-out-his-welcome, spastic, prancing 3rd guitarist, I'm not going to bother with this stuff. Hey, Adrian is back now, so you can leave. I think Blaze needs a writing partner....."
4,Maiden Mania,"Not the best album by Iron Maiden but the best album since Powerslave. Great guitar and Bruce is like alwas a great singer,and Steve Harris is a great songwriter. I think that the songs gonna do wery well alive. I am suprised that Wlidest Dream becom the firsr singel it is not one my favorits on the album."
3,Dance of What?,"True, this album does have it's moments, like Rainmaker and Dance of Death, but if you ask me, most of the CD sucks. I'd rather stick with Powerslave and Brave New World in the future then this."
5,EXCELENTE!!!!,"El disco está genial pra nuevos y viejos fans de la banda... la portada no es tan buena, hay que reconocerlo, pero la música está bastante buena. No hay que desgastarse mucho describiendo científicamente el disco, basta decir que es IRON MAIDEN y que no se venden a MTV como METALLICA.UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good but not that good,"FolksThis is a good album--definitely not their best album--but a good one nonetheless. I would definitely rate it as a must-have for all Maiden fans.I grew up with Maiden. The first album I heard was Number of the beast and that hooked me completely. Then I heard the other masterpieces -- Iron Maiden, Killers etc. etc.After Dickinson left, I kinda stopped listening to Maiden. Don't mistake me--I really appreciate Harris and Nicko and the others, but the Maiden albums were no longer the same with Dickinson gone. Then he came back and I heard Brave New World and now this `Dance with Death'.What I miss is that raw sound of erstwhile Maiden--songs like Children of the Grave, 22 Accacia Avenue, Flight of Icarus etc. etc. The last 2 albums sound polished--too polished and that is probably the problem."
5,Energy giving powerhouse,"Like others, it took a number of times of listening before I appreciated it. At first nothing stuck out that much, except (5) Dance of Death. After listening to it for a week, a few times a day (because I love Iron Maiden!), I can honestly say that this album rocks!! Wherever I am at: working, in the 4Runner, at the gym ... this music shares it's energy with you. You can't help but to feel uplifted and adrenaline-rushed.This album is not at all selfish in sharing it's energy with you. As others have said, the best so far are Paschendale and Dance of Death. Other blood-pumping tunes are Montsegur and Face in the Sand."
3,"good album, but in a bit of a rut","Bought it the day it came out. It is a good Maiden album. I got what I paid for, however, I'm looking for the day where Steve puts the pen down and lets Bruce, Adrian, and Genick determine the sound and feel of the next album. Bruce does sound great, but he seems to be a shade weaker than Brave New World. Any Maiden fan should enjoy this, and be thankful that at least one band does sound like they are supposed to sound."
3,What Happened To Steve Harris??,"I was quite disappointed when I grabbed my copy of DOD from the shelves of Best Buy and saw the cover art...WTF were they thinking? Is that Eddie in that robe?? And the text that ""DOD"" is written in...oh my. But besides that, I was defintely rather disappointed my first listen....but I must admit, the album did grow on me. It is different by leaps and bounds in terms of the sound. This does NOT sound like Maiden to me...sure Bruce is there and Nicko's style is very recognizable...but that's where it ends. Where did Steve Harris go??? To me, their sound is DEFINED by that man's bass playing...not many other bands have ever had such a distinct cutting and driving bass sound. It sounds like Steve was out to lunch on this album...or perhaps Bob Rock slipped in and produced this album under an alias :) Pick it up and check it out...but be warned...it's a new sound."
2,how many times can you make the same album?,"only gave this 2 stars because its maiden, but more closer to 1 star...whats my beef with it? the band is done, these riffs are done, the whole thing is done, I am a big maiden fan, ever since their first album with paul as the singer, I always loved every album they came out with, but this is pethetic, Given, I only listened to it once, so maybe ill give it a second spin and edit this post later, but my problem was every riff, or lyric on here has all been done on their previous album, there is a song that seriously rip of there classic works. I found my self stopping at each song saying ""this is a rip off of fear of the dark, or ""peice of mind"", or ""somewhere in time"" and so on and so forth, and when I wasnt sayign the songs were ripped of, I was sayign the songs were boring.................to all: stick to classic maiden, or by there new dvd visions, its more worth it then this."
2,"Boring, but with a couple of shining pieces","The album is boring and repetitive, with the exception of Dance of Death and The Journeyman. For the last two albums, IM has used a writing style of repetition. It's pretty annoying when they repeat the same line ten times in a row. That's how they get their songs to eight minutes. DoD and The Journeyman are excellent. One is a pretty intricate piece that shows that Nicko can still drum. The Journeyman is an acoustic affair and their best one since Drifter.Buy the album, but it's not worth more than a discounted price or used. Buy all the albums up to Fear of the Dark and you'll be happy."
1,their worst with bruce,"i'll keep this nice and short, this is maiden's worst album with bruce. The best word that comes to mind explaining this album is""dull"""
3,Death to repetition,"Maiden has put out an average album after the powerful return of Bruce on Brave New World. If it weren't for the relentless repetitive choruses on virtually every song, the rating would have been higher. Also, the number of 7+ minute epics is getting a little carried away. Reduce the repitition and several songs could be in the 5 minute range and be much more listenable. I had hoped for better after all this time, but it is still a worthwhile investment."
3,Maiden Fan,"I love every album Iron Maiden has ever put out (excluding the ones with Blaze, cuz those don't count), but I found this one hard to get into. It has a more jolly, happy sound to it and it is a big change for the band. The first song, as well as the song ""Dance of Death"" are two of my favorites on here. I absolutely loved Brave New World, but it seemed like not enough time was put into this album. Maybe it was simply rushed a bit. Most songs are very bland and lack the old Maiden riffs that force you to get excited as hell!!! Bruce's voice was not as strong and clear in this album either. I will continue to listen to this album, as all Maiden fans should, but this is my honest first impulse. Keep the IRONS UP!"
5,Refreshing !,"In a time that metal bands are being portrayed as pimple faced kids with spiked hair, black T-shirts, kakhi shorts who pretend to look depressed, the veterans of Maiden come back to show what metal really is about.I liked this album. As every new Maiden album, it takes me a few listenings to really digest it. But it doesn't take long to realize that this is good old maiden, that is not looking back, but constantly evolving and sounding very current.I do not regret at all. Long live Iron Maiden!"
2,Can't Hear Bruce...,"DOD's music, to me, sounds great as usual, but I have always enjoyed the way the songs told stories. It doesn't seem the vocals were mixed well either...I can barely hear Bruce! Hard to follow the song without hearing the vocals well. I loved BNW and just saw IM in concert last month, and was looking forward to this cd. Pretty dissapointing so far. Maybe like an earlier review, I will keep playing it and maybe warm up to it..."
3,Not as good as one could hope,"After Iron Maiden made a monstrous comeback with classic singer Bruce Dickinson on ""Brave New World"", many hoped that ""Dance of Death"" would more or less be ""Brave New World"" Part 2. However, ""Dance of Death"" is a Maiden mixed bag that features what has kept the band around this long, and also the flaws in the group's songwriting abilities. ""Montsigur"" and ""Face in the Sand"" are prime examples of these flaws, while the title track and especially ""Paschendale"" are classic Maiden tunes that are reminiscent of their ""Powerslave"" and ""Somewhere in Time"" days. Bruce's voice still soars, and the triple threat guitar work still works backed by the immortal bass work by Steve Harris, but ""Dance of Death"" sadly falls flat for half of the disc. Despite that, there's still some pure Maiden moments here, but don't go in expecting the instant classic that was ""Brave New World""."
3,Decent effort by Iron Maiden.,"If you don?t know by now the basic Maiden sound, then you?re gonna be left behind because I don?t think I need to go over it. It?s all here as usual so the BIG differences would have to be the songwriting and production, and they are. I imagine that some people, like me, would compare this album to their previous releases, but keep in mind to not limit yourself to JUST those previous releases. Every song on this album has either a riff, solo, bass line, or vocal melody that most longtime Maiden fans will find very recognizable and they even add a synthesized orchestra. But the lyrics could use some working on. The lyrics are simple, the chourses seem to repeat themselves over and over, but actual songwriting is solid, with Maidens traditional epic storytelling. For some of you, this is an enjoyable Maiden classic, but to some of you, this could be ""Brave New World"" all over again, the choice is yours to decide."
3,Luke warm,"Best track is 'Age of Innocence"". It's nicely done, but really doesn't speak to me. It's not a bad buy if you are a die hard Maiden fan.Compared to other Maiden albums, I'd rate it 3rd to last just above Iron Maiden and No Prayer for the Dying."
2,I don't understand,"I just don't understand. These guys are capable of so much and they write their worst album since, well, ever. It's very cheesy at times. Cheesy is a very bad thing. And why can't we leep into the 2000's on production. How about some crisp drums and crunchy guitars. And how about less keyboards. Anyone who calls this the best Iron Maiden ever obviously never listened to Number Of The Beast or Powerslave. The only song that saves it is track no. 9. Sorry I can't remember the name of track 9, because I left the cd out in my car where it will sit until I sell it at the used cd store. Don't waste your money!"
3,A muddled mess.,"This is easily Maiden's weakest effort since the Bailey days. The songs are muddled, and are all over the place. there is no continuity on this album, unlike on albums like Powerslave and Piece of Mind. Better than most of these new bands out now, but still not up to their previous levels."
3,Worth the money,"I have been an Iron Maiden fan since the early eighties. My favorite lineup includes Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson, so I was really glad to find that they rejoined in 2000 for the Brave New World CD. I don't like this one as much, but it still qualifies as good listening. Bruce's voice does seem a bit strained in some of the songs. It's almost like a live recording on his part. I didn't used to like guitarist Janick Gers much, but I have to admit that he adds some much needed energy to songs like Paschendale (my favorite track on the album). That's the only song that really stands out for me. The others are good, but they don't really stay with me. I still think that Number of the Beast was Iron Maiden's most powerful album. They continue to make good music, but there's nothing ground breaking happening here. A bit derivative, but worth the money."
3,"It's Maiden, but sounds like a new, slower Maiden.","Iron Maiden is one of my favorite bands, however, this is by far not one of their best. I'm glad Bruce Dickinson is back, but I saw Blaze in San Antonio and thought the songs they did from that album more interesting and concert worthy. Iron Maiden has a great history, but this release is average. AGE OF INNOCENCE is a good song for the times and based more on reality than fantasy. The rest of the album does not flow quite as well and may require the listener to be patient to the new, slower Maiden style and repetitive choruses."
3,"Good, not great","I gave this album a couple of listens, and I'm sorry to say that I just couldn't get into it. I'm a relatively new Maiden fan, but I love almost all their work with either Bruce or Paul. Anyway, after you get past the horrendous cover art, the musical content seems really good, but in my opinion this release completely paled to ""Brave New World."" BNW sounds like a revitalized band - and they WERE a revitalized band with the re-addition of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith. By comparison, ""Dance of Death"" sounds more like a band locking into autopilot or ""resting on their laurels,"" if you will. That said, it's not a bad album, but if I saw someone standing in front of the Iron Maiden section at my local music retailer with this and ""Brave New World"" in their hands and a confused look on their face, I'd point them in the direction of BNW."
5,Don't judge an album by it's cover,"First and foremost, yes the cover leaves much to be desired. Eddie is the Grim Reaper standing among refugees from a Salvidor Dali painting. But let's get to the meat of the album and ignore the cover.Right before Bruce left the band, albums like Fear of the Dark and No Prayer for the Dying were relatively weak compared to their frist four albums. However with Bruce's return, Maiden has been gaining strength with better song writing and more powerful songs. Bruce Dickenson is undoubtedly on of metal's best vocalists. His voice is always strong, and even though his hair is short now, there is no compromise with his sound. He could still blow away most frontmen.Highlight tracks for me are Wildest Dreams, Gates of Tomorrow, and Journeymen. Maybe Steve Harris' bass isn't galloping all over the place like in the past, but this is still a very tight, professional band, even with three guitarists."
3,Great Songs - Horrid Sound Recording!,"What is up with the muddled sound? My God, these guys should be recording CDs that sound better than Piece Of Mind because the technology is better than back in 1983.This CD along with Brave New World have God aweful flat bass and the guitars have a broken unclean sound. The songs are excellent though, and this is the only thing that saves the CD.Don't listen to this too loud, as you will blow your speakers. Piece of Mind and Powerslave had the BEST sound engineering out of all the maiden albums."
1,who made the cover? they should punished severly,"i've never listened to this cd but man, that has to be about the worst album cover i have ever laid eyes on."
3,Cover,"The CD is okay, but the cover art is absolute garbage. Nowhere NEAR up to Maiden standards.Just because you have a copy of Poser doesn't make you an artist.Pathetic."
3,"Good, but not great","What I don't understand is how can a great band like Maiden put out a sub-par album.They worked on it for two years and came out with this??? Well its not all bad after a few listen's.The first single isn't at all good in my mind.Paschendale would have been my choice for the single. Missing on this album is Steve Harris's trademark bass lines.Production isn't great either.When I first bought the album and put it in my stereo I was [upset] at the lasck of great songs along with catchy chorus. After listening to it more and more, it grows on you.Key tracks for me are......Rainmaker,No more lies,Montsegur,Dance of death and Paschendale.Journeyman is the bands first ever acoustic track and can I say it will be there last.Journeyman sounds as if it was a Bruce Dickinson b-side and they needed and extra song to put on Dance of Death.All in all.Its a good album, but no were near as good as Brave new world."
5,Maiden Rulz!!! And Eddie is dancing....,"That's right...after 25 years of pure METAL!! Maiden still has what it takes to make a great album. This is an album for True Fans and True Fans only. If you are not a big, die hard, Give Me Ed...'Til I'm Dead Iron Maiden fan then I can already hear you saying how this album is not that great. Trust me, This is a MUST buy and put next to your other Maiden albums. It picks up right where Brave New World left off. I picked up this album at 10:00 AM the day it was released and I had already listened to it like 5 times by 1:00 PM. Just like the other albums, it's very addictive and will leave you wanting more after you're done listening. Buy it, you won't regret it, dance with Eddie all you want ... Up the Irons!!!!"
5,It's Iron Maiden,"I haven't heard this album yet (as the people at Circuit City and Coconuts should all be fired out of a cannon) but I heard ""Wildest Dreams"" when Iron Maiden DESTROYED Chicago last month and I've been a rabid fan since the age of 12 for a reason...because they are the BEST BAND TO EVER COME OUT OF BRITAIN...EVER. I am confident that I will be more than pleased once again. (full review later)"
4,I do not see why this cd gets bad reviews,"I'm glad to see that a lot of people like this album, as they should. First off a lot of the bad reviews this cd has gotten have been almost all crap. I've heard thing shuch as the album does not have any solos, This album shows some of maiden's best guitar work. I have also heard 2 other things, 1.""This sounds like the same old Maiden."" or 2. ""This album is way too different."". I guess that just shows that you can't make everyone happy. Me I think it is a great album, the best since 7th son. This album has everything you could expecet from maiden and much more.Buy this album if 1.you like good music, 2.you like Maiden, 3.you like mature,tasteful music with great harmony and inteligent lyrics"
4,Glimpses of genius,"The album is typical maiden music except for 4 songs.Montsegur - The chorus is classical sounding. The way the melody changes from minor to major scale is amazing in this song. But the intro is directly taken from the fallen angel.Dance of Death - Ah, Dance of death. What a song. Unbeleivably beautiful. It conjures up in your mind visions of a forgotten land where all legends and dreams come true. The best maiden song.Paschendale - It is different in the sense there is lots of tempo changes. But it seems too fragmented to sound good.Journeyman - The keyboards are liberously used here. You can hardly hear the guitars on this one. A departure from the heavy riff laden maiden. A very good song to end it.The other songs are pretty good but nothing extraordinary. Iron Maiden.Buy it for Dance of death."
3,Not Bad but not Number of the Beast either!,"If you liked Brave New World and Fear of the Dark you will like this. If your a fan of PowerSlave and Number of the Beast you will not enjoy this album. It has the commercial sound, not the power that earlier Iron Maiden had. But it still has a nice sound and is better than the crap the new bands are putting together. Bruce's voice is great. But I understand Maiden is getting a little older and trying to appeal to a younger audience. You'll want to play it loud, but it just won't hit you in the heart like the earlier music."
3,An OK album without much individuality,"I had high hopes for this album, since I'm a big Maiden fan and their previous album (Brave New World) surprised me by being able to hold its own against their early successful albums. But somehow DoD doesn't deliver for me. It's not bad, but it just doesn't stick out, doesn't have much uniqueness in it, feels too repetitive. They showed with Brave New World that they can revive themselves, so I hope for a better next album."
4,Better than Expected,"While not their greatest work, Dance of Death is a pretty solid Iron Maiden album. The sound is very much along the lines of 'Somewhere in Time'; which is a comparitive plus if you were one of those who didn't like 'Fear of the Dark' (I won't even compare it to the non-Dickinson albums which were Maiden's lamest in my opinion).The title track ""Dance of Death"" is a solid melodic rocker with numerous interesting tempo changes and some standout vocals. ""Age of Innocence"" is a great piece with some of the best soloing on the album. The first single to be released from this album is ""Wildest Dreams""; and I'm happy to say that (despite being a good song), this is not the album's best by any means. The album features 3 guitarists rather than the original 2 which does change the sound to some degree (giving it a rather layered feel similar at times to 7th Son of a 7th Son). All in all, this is a true metal album; and worth shelling out $13 for."
3,Typical Iron Maiden,"THe first two songs are useless,(""Wildest Dreams"" and ""Rainmaker"") it's rock and roll, not Iron Maiden, it will add nothing to their catalog. Then things start to get pretty amazing and good. Adrian Smith is playing better than never before. A little problem is that Dickinson is screaming a lot instead of singing, singing whole songs at a high range."
2,My god,"This sounds like Manowar and Queensryche got together on a Saturday afternoon, drank way too much, pushed the record button, and started jamming. If that is your idea of a great album, then go ahead and buy it. I'm getting rid of this junk ASAP. Paschendale sounds like a ridiculous Tenacious D song - Bruce even sounds like Jack Black on it for christ's sake! Journeyman? Please - it is total crap. The title track is ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS. Compared to Bruce's solo recordings Accident of Birth, and The Chemical Wedding, this is a MAJOR step backward. Those two albums are amazing - this one, is disgracing.It makes me sad to have to write something like that, but this album is just so awful. DO NOT LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS THAT GIVE THIS 5 STARS. IF YOU ARE A LONGTIME, HARDCORE MAIDEN FAN, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS. NO WAY."
2,IRON MEDIOCRITY,"This may be the most mediocre of all the Maiden albums . I like the fact that they stick to thier guns , but at this point Bruce Dickinson's solo albums blow this stuff away ."
3,Eh...,"Don't get me wrong here. I'm very much a fan of Iron Maiden. It just seems to me that they arent writing songs the way they used to...its more of the same but not of the same quality. I still put Fear of the Dark, Hallowed be Thy Name, etc on on a weekly basis, I havent listened to this album in a few months right now and have no desire to. Paschendale is pretty cool, as is Montsegur, but that's about it for me. One of the main things that I think make a good album great or classic is that it makes you wanna listen to it over and over again through the years. Appetite for Destruction, Kill em All, Powerslave, Dark Side of the Moon...all albums that have been in regular circulation on my playlist for the past 4 years. Dance of Death will not be remembered, so hence I rate it as an average yet disappointing release from a band capable of much more."
4,Not bad But Not Great,Don't get me wrong it's maiden just seems like they have ran out of ideas the good about maiden is there just damn interesting to listento so thats what makes so fun but i expected a bit better and some more originallity on the songs but still a buy for the maiden fans like myself.
4,Solid Album,"Nice work. Some of the songs could have used some editing -- the choruses are repeated a few too many times. But overall, these guys are professionals and the songs generally rock. My favorites are Rainmaker, Paschendale and Montsegur. Maiden's best album since Seventh Son."
5,they're back!!!!,"Let's face it. This is the best Maiden album since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Any one who disagrees doesnt know good maiden. Every song is good on here. Paschendale and Dance of Death alone are worth the price of the CD. Nicko's writing debut ""New Frontier"" is amazing as well and kept me wonderng why he didnt start writing sooner. Buy this album you will not be disappointed."
4,"Great songs, poor sound...","The songs on this disc remind me of the Blaze Baily discs. Good edge, tempos, etc. The Title track is also remeniscent of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. The mix, however, is not good at all. The drums are faint, no deep bass drum nor clear snare or cymbels. Steve's bass is also muddier than in albums past. once you get over these problems, this is still classic Maiden."
4,Absolutely brilliant!!!,"I've had this CD for a couple of weeks now and it has really grown on me. If you liked Brave New World I'm sure you'll love this album. The sound of the songs are a lot like those on BNW but a little more epic. Best tracks would have to be Paschendale, Dance of Death, Rainmaker and Gates of Tomorrow."
5,The Good Days are FINALLY BACK!,"For the people who remember horror productions like ""the X factor"" or ""Virtual X"" must be a pleasure to know that Iron Maiden offers us not just another production but the very best in their last years, the return of Bruce is starting to show, you will provably remember songs of power slave or seven son of a 7th son or maybe no prayer for the dying, what means that the good days are back. These people don't seem to slow down, what its good for us Maiden to the bone.UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!"
2,"For the first time ever, Bruce's voice is the weakest part.","For the first time in an Iron Maiden album, Bruce Dickinson's voice is sounding annoying. Going all the time for the high notes, even sometimes seeming out of tune, his voice is really wrecked this time. He seems to be fighting all the time with his vocal chords. It's totally strange, because in Brave New World and in the subsequent tour he was close to perfection.The songs are, generally speaking, very good. I only have serious restrictions about two songs: Gates of Tomorrow and New Frontier. Absolute fillers, both of them.The production is muddy, that's for sure, like you this term or not. Worse than in Brave New World. Dont'know what happened. Nicko McBrain is also ""sleepy"" here, his drumming is without inspiration or even attempting to make something great.IRON MAIDEN is one of the last true rock bands of the world. They have purpose and respect their fans."
3,DoD,"I was a bit dissapointed when I first heard DoD. I kept listening to it over and over hoping for those catchy maiden riffs. I did however find them somewhat in track 2,8,& 10. I was expecting alot more from a maiden album. DoD is something I would have expected with Blaze Bailey. I do however remain a dedicated maiden fan."
4,you got to realy open your ears on this one.,"Alright.I already placed a review on this site about Dance of Death.I'm just going to put another one out because I fully listened to this album and I realy do enjoy it.The title song has such a great 3 guitar part in it its awsome.Listen to this album more than once and you will love it.The first listen you'll be abit disapointed, but the listen to it more and more.It dose have X factor in it ,along with brave new world.This is a great album and the songs are good to.It isn't better than Brave New World because it dosen't have the great chorus lines that you just sing along with.Its good for all Maiden fans. Its on the top 5 Miaden cd's out there.1- Number of the beast2- Brave New World3- Powerslave4- seventh son/ live after death5- killers/ Dance of Death"
2,Brave New World already explored,"This album sounds almost exactly like Brave New World.Long Gone is the creative Cover Art.Gone is the hard sounding edge from the 80's.Long gone is the high effort they put into recordings.Long gone is the high quality writing, power guitar solo's.Long gone is the 'Great' Iron Maiden.I am hugely disappointed."
2,Iron Maiden has only one flaw..,"Amongst all the reviews and opinions, one thing must be saida: the only trouble holding Maiden back in the compositional skills has a name: Janick Gers, a mediocre, talentless guitarist that, unfortunately, seems to have infected both Murray and Smith."
1,Wake up from hallucination.,"Dance of Death is the worst Iron Maiden album ever !It's even worse than Blaze era.My god, Bruce's last 2 solo albums (Accident of Birth / Chemical Wedding) are million times better than this cd.What is Iron Maiden's problem ?Also it's one of the most boring heavy metal album of the year.Bottom line = DoD is a joke."
1,iron maiden far from worst cd,this cd didnt click with me. nothing special except the guys can still rock. this isnt thier strongest work but not their worst. x-factor or virus anything with that awful blaze bailey where the hell did he come from?the best works are works of the past which still keep iron maiden going strong....best cd's from maiden are....iron maiden...killers...number of the beast....piece of mind...live after death......power slave...7th son of a 7th son....fear of the dark.although i like janick gerrs on guitar adrian smith is iron maiden.... 3 guitar players is too much. i saw them in concert at fiddlers green in denver colorado. great show iron maiden. how about this idea 3 guitar players & 3 singers... blaze & paul.
4,Better than BRAVE NEW WORLD,"The new Maiden can't touch their 80s masterpieces,but it is among their best post 7th Son... -albums!I nearly like all of it's tracks,especially the more up-tempo ones,but i also really have big problems with the long epic tracks-""Journeyman"" and ""Face In The Sand""-they simly bore me to death,and also the title -track is a liitle bit cheesy,but the rest is kinda cool! I like it better than BNW,cause it simply rocks harder and has more up-tempo tunes!Easily on of the best Metal -albums this year,and Maiden still belong to Metals greatest,even although they seem to be past their prime ,their star still shines brighter than that of most of the newer Metal-Bands!Well done,good old Maiden!Up the irons!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,mostly excellent,"Good: no more lies, gates of tomorrow, age of innocence, JourneymanClassic maiden. There were a few songs I'd consider filler, but about half the album was eminitely listenable. Gotta have it if you're a Maiden fan."
4,Best since reunion,"Incredible album and I must say their best since the reunion. Has more quality tracks than brave new world and doesn't have an excessive amount of long epics that plague the latest 2 albums. Montsegur, rainmaker and paschendale are absolute classics. But as other reviews have said it doesn't equal the 80's maiden albums but this one sure comes the closest....so far???"
4,Maiden slowing down? Have no such fear,"After you've gotten over how awful the cover is (which is strange as the inlay book is quite well done), you'll be propelled into the world that is so uniquely Maiden. The opener, Wildest Dreams, is my least favorite and I must say had me worried. As Rainmaker blasted forward, I was relieved. It is one of the best tracks on the album (and one of the best Maiden tracks in a while). Dance of Death, Paschendale, Age of Innocence (for those who love Maiden melodic) and Journeyman are also way up there and will be instantly adored my fans. Not their best, but more than enough moments to warrant repeat listens."
4,Very Best of....Billy Fury.,"I think that many people often choose a CD for maybe one or two songs.This was not my first choice as I was told that it (my first choice) couldn'tbe delivered to Australia.I then chose this one, which has the songs I wanted, plus all the other songsare very good. I was a huge fan of Billy Fury when I was growing up, he was oneof a kind.The CD is in very good condition, but....given the cost of postage I didn't think itwould take more than four weeks to get here. That is my only gripe with this transaction."
5,Book Nitty-Gritty,"A handsome volume from Takarajima Books: black cloth over hardback boards with a sewn binding. Released with dustjacket.119 pp. 2.5 pounds. Almost all b&w; photography, one image per page."
5,Lotrimin powder is very effective.,This product is ideal for controlling yeast infection anywhere on the body. It is being used by a diabetic to stop the infection before it gets a chance to set up house. Thank you for making this available at a reasonable cost.Lotrimin AF Antifungal Powder 3 oz (90 g)
1,Bootleg Alert!,"I have all of Groove Collective's legit stuff back as far as the eponymous first one and am pleased with all but this one. It is an ""authorized bootleg"". The sound quality does not come anywhere close to doing them justice. Get ""People People Music Music"" instead. That one is a 5-star CD."
2,This book is more for inspiration,"This book is more for inspiration, praises and introduction for the motion graphics works done by 18+ experts in the field.Most examples are not really explained or guiding you in details. Many folders in the companion DVD do not contain the actual examples for you to follow. (This may be because as the book title said that these are studio secrets).Read this book for leisure only but do not dwell on it."
1,dissapointed,this book is a complete waste of money. paul nison either is unintelligent or just doesn't feel like researching the subject. he talks like he's god's gift but he is not inspiring as he claims to be.
1,difficulty with techngnet returns,"I have been trying to return this item as the way it is posted appears that it is the portable model.it is not, just has the portable bag.they did not provide with a phone number and returns are hard.purchase through a differnt company. the bose system is good. the new model is even better. it is just the techngnet seller."
1,"Usually Dummies books are good, but this one....","A horrible book to introduce you to Flash and a waste of money. At the end, I really didn't understand how the program worked - only how certain tasks are done. There's a lot of fluffy chapters. A much better book is Rosanna Yeung's Flash MX 2004 Hands-On Training.I bought this Dummies book based on the quality of other Dummies books I have, but this one was a real disappointment."
3,"Block for block, nice","I used this for about 6 months now, and is quite satisfy with the board.I do chop a lot with my cleaver. And it stand up to it.The color is not bad. But I don' t if I need to put that chopping board oil onEvery once in a while or not.The last board I had was half the thickness J A Henckels and about the same size and it lastedFor about 10 years and I don' t take care of it with oil or anything.I hope this can beat it.It a bit heavy and if your have granite countertop, just be carefully when using on top on it.I really hope they had included a rubber pad beneath each legs to soften the chopping blow.It does makes quite a bit of sound when chopping on granite.Update:The board buckle up a bit over time and the four leg is no longer level."
2,Not as good as the older editions,"Graphics are good and the animation is smooth. However, not much else is positive for this game. I'm not a big fan of the playcalling menus. Too hard to tell what's going on from the play illustration, especially on the defensive side. I also don't like how you can't pan out to see the receivers when you are controlling an LB or DB on defense like you could in the old Dreamcast versions. This makes it virtually impossible to play a corner and difficult to play an OLB in coverage. Also annoying is the vertical leraning curve between walk-on and starter difficulty. It is easy to win 80-0 in walk-on, and then play the same team in starter and lose 20-7. From what I can tell, all raising the difficulty does is make your receivers drop every pass coming their way if there is a defender within 5 yds, while not affecting the computer at all. This game is a real disappointment, as I love the older Dreamcast editions."
1,Ziploc,"Where are the rest of my Ziploc bags ?Only was sent 1 box, and would like to know where the other 19 are ?"
5,scary but true,"I lived in watseka for many years.The houses in the book are haunted by the people in the book.I know first hand about the hauntings. The house that I lived in was build on the foundation of the house that was burned in the book. I also knew the people who lived in the other two houses and been in the other two houses in the book. All the houses are still haunted to this day. The house I lived in you could hear glass braking. Door knobs would move and nobody was there. People going up and down the stairs. Many,many other things. In one of the other houses doors open and close. Everyone could be out back and you could come to the front door and knock and someone would tell you to come in. But no one would be in the house. So when you read this book remeber it is true. I lived in that town and my family and I know first hand how true this book is.."
5,"Lost, but not forgotten","I read this book many years ago. My dad(deceased) had this book. I read it at least 3 or 4 times and then it was passed to someone else in the family and after the years it got lost. Would love to find it again. It was a wonderful account of the supernatural. It had my full attention from the very start and held it all the way through. I have never been to Watseka, but I do believe in what the book and author told. Wonderful read and would suggest it to anyone interested in the supernatural."
4,First Book I Remember Reading,"Okay, it may not be fair to give a review, but here I go. I was just sitting here trying to remember one of the first books I read for fun. Not the books that made a life impression on me, you know, like the Catchers in The Ryes and Walden's, but a real, fun, ""oh my gosh I can't wait to read this novel tonight"" and this book came to mind. So good to see it still has the same cover. But this book left an impression on me, was creepily wonderfuly and suspenseful and I gobbled it up. Good stuff."
1,REALLY cheaply made,"This flag had great reviews and a fictional suggested retail price of $38.50. The seams are not sewn straight and broken in many places. There is a pleat in the blue background seam and the heavy duty polyester heading is non-existant. The header is just doubled white nylon and the colored material shows through. It is not even trimmed evenly before the white header is sewn on. I doubt I will be able to use it on my flagpole. The $10 it cost, half of which was shipping, is more than what I would pay for a better made cheap flag in the supermarket. I see no country of origin on the cello pack or the flag. I definately do not recommend this product!"
1,Very low quaity,I was not impressed at all! The flag arrived tightly folded in plastic and the fold marks would not relax and were plainly evident even after subjected to 5 months of outdoor use. This flag was much louder than others I have owned I assume due to the material. I will be replacing soon as it has become very faded and is starting to tatter after only 5 months of use (my last flag was almost two years old before it was in this state).
5,Great flag!,"No problems here! Shipping was very quick and the flag seems to be of very good quality. I have had it up for about a week, and it looks great! Plus it flies very easily. Just try and take it inside during very bad storms to keep it nice for as long as possible."
4,Good value,Good flag for the money. It lasts for 6 months in Kansas before fraying out on the end. Retains its colors well.
1,Do Not Purchase - Fake Pictures,This flag is crap. I feel very ripped of. The photos show embroidered stars. This is a poorly printed plastic flag. It's a joke.
2,Faded and torn,After my first flag that came with my pole faded over 1 year of daily use I bought this one. Now today I noticed it has holes about 4 inches long and it too is faded. The holes are along the lines of where it was folded at the factory. It has flown daily for 6 months but taken down during storms. I will look else where for my next flag.
1,3x5 Nylon American Flag,"This product was not as described. The pictures and weight were not accurate. This flag was not a heavy duty flag for outdoor use, like the Valley Forge flags. Will say, seller did refund money when asked to do so, that was the only good thing."
2,Not So Good,The flag is made out of nice material but the stitching was out in a lot of places and I ended up resewing it so it wouldn't fall apart.
1,Not American made,This flag is cheap and not made in America and I highly recommend you but a local flag instead it would be of much better quality and made in America
5,Great Value On A Great Flag Displayed For Conservative American Values!,We displayed our old American flag following the World Trade Center attack in 2001. Our son was in the Navy serving aboard the USS Carl Vinson which led the retaliation strikes into Afghanistan. We didn't take the old flag down for nearly a year until he and his shipmates returned safely to their home port in Bremerton Washington. The continuous display of the flag took it's toll on her. We purchased this flag as a replacement and now fly it on our house to show our support for America. America is now under internal attack from a Socialist movement from within. We now fly this new flag to support those brave representatives in Congress who are fighting for America's Conservative values. It is a great flag and I would recommend it to anyone who loves America!
3,Not as pictured,"This flag is pictured with a rope and thimble. The flag shipped just has grommets. The seller does not reply to emails about the discrepency. They leave the incorrect picture posted, even though they have been informed. Not a good way to do business."
1,US Chinese made flag,"This is a cheap, very thin Chinese made flag. It's so thin it weighs next to nothing. The so-called brass grommets are actually tinted aluminum. You pay for what you get. This junk gets burned at the American Legion Post. The seller states American made. The thin bag it came in has Chinese type on it. No way the shipping weight is 2 lbs, more like 12 oz. Nowhere does it say Made in USA."
1,Returns are not easy...,"SENT email to Seller (SevenBro.com)the Day I received Flag,(12-28-11) 3 wks latter no response.. -Received flag from SevenBrothersmercantile today, flag is damaged, has several material flaws with a 1/2 hole. The flag appears to to a defective flag repackaged. Have purchase several other flags from amazon in the past and they all came double wrapped (once in a clear sealed wrap and another in a sealed envelope. This flag was not prepackaged in any thing but folded and shipped in a 6 X 9 brown envelope. I do not think the Fag I received was a new Flag. Please send me a new flag or refund my money. Thanks Robert L Greene- email was sent to amazon & seller- have not heard anything from Amazon or seller (1-18-12)Note -amazon does notlist a human contact you can talk to. Returns easy? Dont think so!"
5,"it is a beautiful flag,,","quality is great... so glad we ordered this one,and it was because of the reviews I read about it.."
4,you get what you pay for,"i only needed this flag for a photography assignment, and after that i will probably display it inside my house or in my bedroom (my husband serves in the military). it is exactly as described & pictured. like the title says, you get what you pay for! and for $8, i'm certainly not going to complain."
3,cheap flag,"flag is cheap, but so was the price. I will not hold up if you have much wind. We do here, so I did some maintence on it and hope to streach out the time I can use it. Have had it now for several months, It is already wearing out fast. If you dont have much wind I think it might hold up for a couple of years. You get what you pay for. As I am poor and wanted to fly a flag, I am relatively happy."
4,patriotic,the flag is made of good quality material and can withstand plenty of wind y days and a few hail storms.very happy with it
3,Disappointed,"Just wasn't the style advertised on the website. Didn't have grommets, didn't have raised stars, had difficulty hanging on my flag pole without the grommets, and this was extremely frustrating. Needed it though for an empty flag pole, so it will have to do until I order another one."
1,Poor quality,"The flag was sent right away, good service. When I set the flagon my deck. The first week it started to fray and come unsewened.You talk about CHEAP! O'yes guess where it was made?"
5,My Favorite Book as a Child,I have carried this book around for many years and recently read it again. I remember now why I carried it around. It is still a great story. One that is not only loved by children but adults. Highly recommended.
5,Delightful story - not scary,"This is a book I've loved ever since my fourth grade teacher read it to us at school. Don't confuse it with other titles that have ""Little Witch"" in its title - this is a stand alone. Minikin doesn't like being a witch and when her witch mother (Madame Snickasnee - great name!) goes to sleep during the day, she slips out of the house and goes to school. She makes friends with normal children, who are enchanted with her flying broomstick. They welcome her into their home. She, in turn, invites them to visit her at night when Madame Snickasnee is away. Minikin experiments with different-colored magical powders on the stove, making the Pied Piper, a pixie, and other magical creatures appear. This is the way she discovers her REAL mother - a beautiful fairy. A delightful story!"
5,Rainy Day Ecstacy,"I, too, read this book countless times as a girl, at least 45 years ago. One of my favorite things to do on a rainy or snowy day was to get in bed and enjoy this story. I would get the warmest feeling from the way the story turned out, but also found the situations where Minx and her friends fooled around with the potions to be very exciting! I found a copy in our library about 15 years ago, but no more, so I started the quest to find one for my daughter, not knowing the author. My daughter's name is Anna Elizabeth - could it have been in my sub conscience? Hurray for used book sellers!"
2,My opinion,"After playing the first one and really liking it, this takes place in the same exact place with very little difference.Buy the first one for 19.99 and save some money because it's the same thing"
4,Nice,"Just two words that describe Onimusha 2, absolutely good. It's so much fun to play and I think this is easily one of my favorite new games to play. My favorite character in the whole game is of course Kotaro Fuma, that ninja boy that Jubei meets in Imasho. This is such a great video game, the scenery (in Imasho alone) is gorgeous!The fighting is fun in this game. The backstories many characters have are great. I didn't really like the character interaction but I can see how some people might like it. Overall, this is a great game."
2,"Best of times, Worst of times...","This is a very mixed review. This game is the most beautifully appealing game on the PS2 so far. The characters, effects and backgrounds are great! The story is good. These characters have personalities and histories.HOWEVER, the biggest detractor from the game is its poor control and camera. This is THE WORST game control I've seen for this level of a game. The D-Pad is clumsy and distracting... I grew tired of watching an awesome samurai bump into walls etc. The camera angles make it even worse.If the controls were better or customizable, this game would get 5 stars!In order to get through this game, you'll need the patience of a Zen master."
1,forgettable sequel to onimusha,"i loved onimusha. i hated onimusha 2. an utter waste of time and money, and i bought it for only 9.99. when i got to the final boss battle, i couldn't help but think 'this is it?' then i tried beating nobunaga a half dozen times or so, but couldnt since i used all my healing items and magic replenishers going into the purple phantom realm. if i had known that the final boss was right after i would have skipped it and whipped him good. so i finished the purple phantom realm and was hurt irreparably and only got some dinky sword. what a tur%. since i completed the whole game on normal i wasn't about to drop to easy mode just to beat the last boss. so i tossed the cd-rom in the garbage, something i had thought about doing quite a few times before as the game never started, and never really got going. a game without a soul. but there were a couple of pretty places with some nice graphics, that is the only positive.avoid"
5,weapon,"This game weapons are sword, bow, arrow, fire arrow, improved gun, improved bullets, blazing fire sword, Dancing thunder knife, ice blade spear, rotating wind maru,and soil barren hammer."
5,Onimusha is back with a bang,"This would surely be the best game on the PS2 if it were just a little bit longer. I have to warn you, if you're looking for a fun game, then you've found it, but if you don't like short games maybe you should reconsider buying this. Personally, I have never played such a great a game and I would recommend it to any Capcom fan. It's like Street Fighter, Final Fantasy, and Resident Evil all in one game, so if you like any of those(and don't mind how short the game is) buy Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny right now!Graphics - 10Sound - 9.8Difficulty - 9Gameplay - 10Length/Lasting Appeal - 6.5OVERALL - 9.3"
1,Bad game review,"I have played many ps 2 games and this is bad. I can't use the analog stick to move. I have to use the pad. When I use the game pad.. I still can't move in the direction I want to go. Up is not up, more like moving back wards. There is no option to change to the controller stick. Yea, the graphics are great but that is all I will say for this game. I will return back to game stop. I would rate this video game a big 0 if I could. And I love fighting games."
5,THE GREATEST LIVING BLUES MAN!!!,"ANOTHER GREAT CD FROM THE BEST BLUES MAN YOU NEVER HEARD OF!I HAVE OVER 5000 SONGS ON MY IPOD AND IT SEEMS I AM CONSTANTLY FLIPPING SONGS UNTIL A BRYAN LEE SONG COMES ON,THEN I'M IN HEAVEN.IF YOU LIKE THE BLUES I RECOMMEND BUYING ALL OF HIS CD'S!"
1,Doesn't take files very well,"I bought this hard drive with the intention of ripping my CDs to it to put on my IPod. Finally got around to it, and the drive was corrupted within a week. Don't waste your money."
4,Very Good!!!!,"I bought the GBA last August when it first came out with the original GT Advance. The game was excellent except the password part. Now I tried GT Advance 2 and it was fun!!! No more annoying passwords, to save you use the Battery Save feature. Theres also a new feature that lets you listen to your co-driver as he navigates you through tough spots on a trail. This game is cool!!"
5,Great overview,Speaking of Indians gives me an overview and discusses language and culture in such a way I am engaged and I can utilize this information in the diversity class I teach.
3,Arrived damaged but seller was totally cooperative!,"Although this item was damaged, the seller refunded my c. card immediately. I would definitely buy from this vendor again because of the prompt and good customer service I received."
3,Made in China,This knife is ok for the price. It is made in China so that tells you something right away. It is much larger than you might think based on the pictures. I would not purchase from this seller again because it took weeks longer to arrive than was promised and I was charged $6.00 shipping when the label from the post office clearly says $0.85. There are definintely better options.
4,Chen's Knife,"Joyce Chen's Sushi knife works well for me. It has both length and sharpness that performs well in slicing sushi rolls and raw fish, I would not hesitate to buy another for myself or as a gift to an aspiring sushi chef.."
3,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"This is a good remix album. The original album ""You And Me Against The World"" is not so good....but this remix album is verry cool. Apop is in desperate need of a 'return to the dark'..nevertheless, ...this silly little ""EP"" isn't so bad as far as dance music is conscerned."
3,eh.. ok,"Eh... it's ok... a few of the pieces are nice... but all in all, the originals exceed the remixes on this one."
5,The Master at Work,"When the others want to see, listen and experience how it's done - this does it and more. No wonder they keep coming back for more. The Class act of entertainment."
1,So disappointed,"I had such high hopes and really wanted this to be good when I read all of these great reviews. Bottom line - it is horrible. In so many songs, Neil Diamond sounds out of breath and muffled. The production is poor. I can't believe I paid so much money for it. I bought it mostly because of the great reviews here and I sincerely wish I had not. Save your money."
5,cyclops figure,My son is a big nightmare before christmas fan and likes everything connected with it. He has a lot of figures and this was an addition to his collection. He was really happy with it and we will buy more of these products.
2,A lot of self boosting,"Well, I bought this book hoping that it would give a direction to push harder for sales in a softer matter! But I read it and realized that the Author was really more interested in talking about his success! It was not a map out of how to sell in all kinds of markets but more towards Insurance and or Stocks. Its not a concrete tool to use in larger sales like Cars or Manufactured Homes. Some sales were underlined in Real Estate, but not enough to focus on. But, I will say I was going in looking for an outline to follow and did not receive it! It was full of success stories, more then how to work to become more successful. It was an easy read, but it did not help me personally."
1,hardball selling,It was a complete waste of money. A lousy book. If I could have seen it in a store I would not have bought it. Sidney Checketts
3,firewire ipod,"wish it worked better. Doesn't seem to work at all latest generation of ipod. Also, isn't faster than a firewire 400 connection, it's just designed to free up firewire 400 ports on your computer. I didn't find this info available from Griffin's product description."
2,Well . . .,"This is the expected mix of traditional and original songs, but the traditional ones were pretty standard ""country Christmas"" fare, and the originals were rather bland. Nice enough, but no stunners. And guys, this just isn't how the Hallelujah Chorus should be done. Nor even Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, for that matter!"
5,Great Book,Very interesting and very educational. Really helped me to understand my child's problem. I definitely recommend this book! Very Helpful.
5,Tangible help,This book break down the root of anxiety and provides real life examples on how to help your children work through their aniexty. The book is organized in a way that the information is easy to read.
4,"Good background info but not good as a ""how-to"" guide for parents","This is a great general book on all types of anxiety, if you want to understand someone's anxiety or your own. As a parent, it didn't really help me to help my 9 year old. In contrast, the workbook called ""What to Do When you Worry Too Much"" by Dawn Huebner is easily understood by kids and parents, and we were able to start working on anxiety issues right away. It uses the same techniques that are found in this book, but helps you to apply them. I also like Anxiety Free Kids by Zucker, which uses the same techniques but goes into a little more detail. But we started with Huebner's book--easy to understand and apply."
5,Fantastic!,"This book is exactly what I was looking for. It very clearly explains anxiety problems and how to deal with them. The solutions are very straight-forward, practical and helpful."
5,"Freeing Your Child from Anxiety: Powerful, Practical Solutions to Overcome Your Chlikd's Fears, Worries and Phobias","The title says it all. I had read several books looking for a solution as to how to help my daughter overcome her fears. This book gave simple, clear cut advice on how to help her guide her thoughts to work through the fear."
4,"Freeing Your Child From Anxiety: Powerful, Practical Solutions to Overcome Your Child's Fears, Worries, and Phobias","This book has been a huge help and I have recommended it to several other parents of children like mine. It has made it easier to help my son who is a perfectionist to let go and know that not everything is under his control and it is okay. He is going to sleep much better and even when stressed, he knows the steps to make his mind shut off and go to sleep."
4,Extremely Helpful,"This book was extremely helpful to me, covered everything I needed and more, thoroughly recommend it."
4,good book,this is a comprehensive book on the topics. i enjoyed reading it and the techniques mentioned are very helpful too.
5,Hilarious,"This is by far the funniest dictionary out there! It is a favourite party entertainer! Just pick it up, open it and read, you'll love it! You won't be able to stop laughing and neither will your friends!!!!"
4,Blues: Same Old Song [IMPORT] Leon Russell,"Obviously the review by Anthony reveals he doesn't know much about blues music. Some Blues are slow moving! This cd is 100% Leon, only in Blues form and is a wonder for your ears. The gospel revival sound 'that was once his trademark' is still very much alive! My advice is to take your 30 plus $'s and purchase it! ""Uninspired music"", I don't think so. There is not one song I have EVER listened to that Leon has put out that could be considered 'uninspired'."
2,Proceed with caution on this one!,"If you are expecting vintage Leon Russell here forget it! Leon Russell ""Blues"" is slow moving and uninspired music that makes one long for that early honky-tonk, gospel revival sound that was once his trademark. My advice to the uninitiated is simply avoid this cd and take the 30 plus dollars that it would take to purchase this import and buy his ""Retrospective"" and ""Leon Live"" cd's and experience Leon at his studio and concert best."
5,Good Balance of Math and History,"For me, this book had the exact right balance of math and history. There is some mathematical discussion but nothing to scare anyone who has taken calculus. The historical discussion really helps one understand how mathematical thought has evolved over the last few hundred years."
4,all about e,"This book is a highly readable history of the concept of e, the base of natural logarithms. I first encountered this number more than fifty years ago, and have used it on close to a daily basis ever since. So the author did not need to sell me on its importance. I worry about whether people with no calculus background will understand much of the book. Also, in places, the historical details should be more accurate. But it is still a very interesting and informative work."
5,Very enjoyable read,"I tend to read much more non-fiction than fiction these days, especially science non-fiction from a layman's perspective. This book was quite enjoyable because it touches on so many facets of mathematics all due to one number. If you have ever wondered about the types of numbers (integers, rationals, transcendentals), or the famous equation e ^ (pi * i) + 1 = 0, then this explains it all in an enjoyable fashion.The author discusses the history of the number, which makes it much more accessible; you almost feel as if you were learning about it along with the original researchers."
2,"Good book, lousy Kindle rendition","The book was most interesting but the Kindle experience was very frustrating. If Amazon wants that people are willing to pay a decent price for ebooks, the editorial quality must mach that of printed books. All the mathematical formulas in the book were full of mistakes: dxldy instead of dx/dy, A instead of Delta, x"" instead of x^n, I instead of 1 etc. I could go on and on. It looks like they took the book through an OCR software and didn't care to check it afterwards.I haven't seen the printed version but if it is of good printing quality, I would recommend it to anybody interested in the history of mathematics and the peculiarities of transcendental numbers. Now the reading experience was shadowed by my trying to understand what the misprinted equations really mean."
5,"Erudite & great fun, book could inspire a love of maths","This will be more easily digested with a knowledge of calculus, but it includes one of the best introductions to calculus I have read. A wonderful read."
2,No clear path and fog along the way.,"The book lacks direction. The author wanders from topic to topic without driving to a point. The mathematical expressions and terms cloud rather than explain. By the time one reaches the end of a string of expressions, one forgets why you started or where you were being led. Definitely more mathematical than historical. My idea of well written ""popular"" book of math is ""Fermat's Engima"" by Simon Singh."""
1,"Wandering essay lacks eloquence, elegance, and breadth","Maor wanders aimlessly, padding his essay with trivial sidetrips and attempts at spice. His imaginary conversation between Bach and Bernoulli is completely inaccurate regarding musical scales and just intonation. This book tries to approach Beckmann's _A History of Pi_ in its erudition, but it fails because it lacks the eloquence, elegance, and breadth that characterize the best popular books on mathematics."
2,"This is the story of a bunch of things, one of them e.","I was looking for a book to tell me everything about e. If this book does so, then the story of e is not all that intersting, and you are likely to know a lot of it if you have taken some calculus or real analysis courses. Not all that much info about e, a lot of blah blah, and a lot of stuff not really about e (whole chapters) I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
3,"Decent book (***), terrible kindle version! (*)","Beware, the kindle version of this book has so many conversion mistakes in the mathematics notation, it is ABSOLUTELY shameless. Nice coverage of the history of and around the natural logarithm and the number e."
2,great story but kindle version is not legible,"While the content was very fascinating, the kindle version was terrible. Most equations and tables were not legible; therefore, difficult to understand. It is a shame that Amazon actually sells it in such a poor form. Is there a way to exchange it for a printed version? If it wasn't for the Kindle version, I would prob. have given a 5 star."
5,"Fabulous book, but there is an important error","This is a wonderful book, but there is an error in a crucial explanation on page 66. This has to do with the calculation of the area under the curve y=1/x. The error is that the height of the curve at position a is not (1/a) as stated in the book, but is (1/ar). Therefore, the common areas are not 1-r, but ((1-r)/r). Same observation holds, though, namely that the areas defined by geometrically decreasing widths have equal areas, and hence a log must be involved.An alternative correction is to leave the algebra, but change the diagram so that the rectangles are under the curve, in which case everything works out as written.Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to grasp the ""meaning"" of e."
4,"Goes easy on the math; a good companion to books on pi, i","Of the numerical histories you'll find via the links on this page, this is the easiest to read. Beckman's ""pi,"" while more a history of ideas through one idea, contains more difficult math than this book, though not much of it. Nahin's book on i is very heavy on math, though some of it is very simple and a lot of it is repetitive in nature. All three are very good, and well worth reading. I enjoyed all in slightly different ways, but this one was the most, well, fun. The books, by the way, should be read in the order pi,e,i, as that is the order in which they were ""discovered"" and their use popularized. After reading them all, I am not sure that e is not a more subtle concept than i. See what you think."
1,Kindle edition is awful,"I bought the kindle edition and the reading has been a nightmare. Two main reasons:1. Why do they keep referencing page numbers (i.e. see pag. 287). How the hell I am supposed to go to that page in my kindle!2. The mathematical symbology craps. Many formulas are wrong, symbols lost, exponents lost...I think Amazon relies too much in OCR software for the scanned documents and this software is definitively deficient with math symbols. In addition, if someone at Amazon would have read the kindle edition they would never have offered it to the public!"
4,the calculus dolt speaks,"I am taking analytical geometry right now, and this book is a lot of what the course leaves out. Which is the why and what lead someone to do what they did, which makes for an enlightening read."
3,Light and enjoyable reading,"This book is a nice mix of mathematical history and elementary calculus, although you'll have (hopefully) heard a lot of the material from your final (school) year's mathematics teacher. It's good bus-reading material--just a little too light on medium duty material for me to bestow on it a better rating."
4,"Thoughtful, spacious electric & acoustic guitar composition.","This CD is great for those who love the spaciousness of Rypdals compostions but also enjoy his rock style electric guitar work. Here he gives both and it works beautifully, resulting in a thoroughly satisfying album. His acoustic playing is very thoughtful as well. This album features shorter pieces but with the same flavor of some of his more lengthy compositions. His electric guitar tones are classic Rypdal."
5,WOW - Great Game,This game really makes things a bit more lifelike. I have played both the Madden and the NFL 2K3. And honestly they both are GREAT games but with their own personality! But this game is a MUST have!
5,This game is awesome,This game is a lot better than Madden and it is fun for people who don't evevn know football.
1,This game is terrible,This game is not fun at all. You just wanna quit after the first kickoff. One time I played this game andI was the Titans. By the end of the game I had won 111 to 7 and Eddie George had 425 yards rushing with 8 total touchdowns. This was on rookie difficulty. Then I turned up the difficulty and was the Rams. Kurt Warner threw 3 interceptions in the first quarter and I lost 31 to 0 and they were the Cardinals. Madden is a much better game and I love the new mini camp mode.
3,not too bad but,"ok i got this game right when it came out. I was expecting big things from it because well last year's version was great!! this year's graphic's are a lot better than last year's but good luck at trying to run the ball. It is extremly difficult to run right up the middle or to a toss. you have to find a play where the TE will make a good block otherwise you won't get off a good run. also in this years version, you can almost make every throw you throw at a reciever. at one point in the game i was like 12-15 throwing the ball and they were all deep routes with the temp 0 and heavy snow. so you can make almost any throw. franchise mode is cool also and with espn in the game, it makes it better than last year's version. if your into new graphics and throwing the ball this game is for you, if not and you like simple versions, but madden"
1,Why am i even writing this?,After being disappointed by the previous Sega NFL titles I decided to give this one a try after a friend recommended it to me. Renting it was a waste of my money and playing it was a waste of my time. The gameplay on this game is horrible. Even on the most difficult setting you can run plays that the defense cant stop. If you want the best NFL game out there it's EA's Madden 2003. As usual EA's title beats Sega to a pulp. If you would excuse me I'm going to go play Madden.
5,Madden Should Take Note,"As someone who has owned 7 volumes of the Madden franchise (including 2002 on PS2), I have found 2K3 refreshing, fun, and free of annoying commentary. Don't get me wrong. I love Madden on tv. His gaming presence, however, is wearing thin. Passing game and blocking game on 2K3 are far superior to Madden 2003. If you're getting tired of the same ole routine, give 2K3 a try."
1,If you enjoy yelling...,"If you are a CInicinattie Bengals fan or a Detroit lions fan, this might be a good game to get. You will be used to watching games where your offense has no flow, and you get frustrated and turn off the TV. If these are not qualities you look for in a football game, skip it and buy Madden."
1,This game is horrid,"I loved the NFL2k series on the DC and skipped last years addition due to no online play for the ps2.This year I bought the game and can't stand it. It is absolutely no fun whatsoever and will frsutrate everyone. I have played it throughouly and have to sell it due to the fact that I get so angry.The CPU will ALWAYS score tons of points until you get near perfect and learn tricks, but then its not like real football. When was the last time a linebacker had to cover WR with Safety and CB help EVERY play?? Exactly, the CPU also breaks tackles like its nobody's business, It took 3 linebackers (the Redskins ones!!) 2 DEs, a CB and a Safety to bring an RB down.So stay away at all costs"
5,Something very rare in Sci-Fi,"Pallas is something very rare inaSci-Fi read, it provoked me into thinking about the nature of our society. I wasn't a liberatrian before this but I seriously considering it now. I am ordering copies for my two nephews, maybe it'll also start them thinking. Though the novel ends on an optomistic note, probably in the real world men like Altman will win out and we will all live in Greeley."
5,"Prometheus-award winning book beats his ""Probability Broach""","This book reminded me of Frederic Brown's 'Rogue in Space' or Alfred Bester's 'The Stars my Destination.' It deals with a lone individual and his surroundings. A good novel for introverts! The writing is more fluid and jus' plain ole' better than earlier novels ('Probability Broach' was good, but heavy on the political philosophy/economy etc.). This book seems an almost direct successor to Heinlein had he had the Howard family genes and access to the internet. Oh well, just read it!"
5,"Guns = A Free People, Even on Asteroid Colonies","The asteroid Pallas is colonized by a self-reliant,capitalist, high-technology society based on hunting.The novel centers around how a young immigrant (EmersonNgu) trapped in a socialist farming commune (The GreeleyProject) escapes to freedom outside. Now free to starve,Emerson learns to shoot, hunt, and provide for himself.Through his subsequent adventures, Emerson finds that toenslave people you must first disarm them, and that isimpossible in a society designed so that you must huntin order to survive."
1,"Moderately entertaining, but ..","Somewhat entertaining, but ultimately L. Neil Smith spends too much time trying to write politics rather than entertainment. Not groundbreaking in anyway, although it should appeal to libertarians."
1,Please!,"Dear Donald Spoto: you made it to the Marilyn DVD 'Diamonds Collection' with your MM biography statement....a bio which I would have bought until seeing your research on Jesus. You failed in your duty to do your research properly or you would have found mentions of the ongoing bestseller in Europe since 1991: 'Maria Valtorta, Der Gottmensch: Leben und Leiden unseres Herrn Jesus Christus, Parvis Verlag, CH-1648 Hauteville/FR', 4500 pages, 12 volumes by now translated in any major language. A work of grace dictated by Jesus during World War II to Maria Valtorta. Where THE story is told of anything unseen about Jesus you ever dreamed of. Besides, HE is alive, he IS GOD, and what do you say to him tomorrow? Check out 'Valtorta' sites, I myself wrote an 450 webpage index of those jewels. Seek and you will find. No offense and never mind, but do not offense the owner of it all! Thank you"
5,A firm yet gentle journey through Christ's life,"Donald Spoto takes the reader on a fascinating journey.He encourages the reader to explore the differing aspects of Jesus' life,as evidenced by many sources---some conflicting. His ideas or beliefs while not all in the mainstream are also not too threatening. Not once are the fundamental values of Christianity undermined but in some cases enriched with his perceptions. This reader for the first time actually came away from a religious work with some understanding and a thirst for more knowledge concerning Christ's life, his works, and his mission."
4,very thought provoking and intelligent,"Mr. Spoto let some light into area's that a lot of catholics are afraid to let known. He expresses what a lot of catholics feel and think but generally are in fear of expressing about Jesus, Mary and the Church. Well worth reading."
5,Through a glass darkly,"As a Southern Baptist who has spent [1] the last 36 years as a professor in a Roman Catholic university and [2] the 69 years since his conversion wondering why he had never been able to experience the blinding, ""born again"" feeling of the Apostle Paul or Jimmy Carter or many other sincere Southern Baptists, I am delighted to report that the several hours I have just spent in absorbing much of Donald Spoto's wisdom have been very instructive. At this point, let me make one constructive criticism. Many of his sentences, like my first one in this review, are so long and complex that I had to re-read them before becoming comfortable with the content. On balance, however, this is a book that I will read again and again and will recommend it to my family and friends."
2,"Lightweight, Pedantic","For anyone with even a theological education, this book is lightweight garbage, poorly researched, very derivative of the work of legitimate scholars. I am a pastor who is always looking for more popular (and readable) works for my parishioners. I had hoped this would be one of those books because I certainly agree with Spoto's general approach to Jesus but I found it plodding and dreary.I would recommend Marcus Borg's ""Meeting Jesus Again For the First Time,"" the works of John Dominic Crossan, or Bishop John Shelby Spong's works for those who are looking for an unorthodox interpretation of the life of Jesus. I don't know if it's in print any longer but ""For Christ's Sake"" by Harpur (I think it was put out by Beacon Press) is a wonderful book. Spoto's work is going right in the give-away pile.And again, as a ""Rev. Dr."" I hope I can use my credentials to advise you that the research in this book is very sloppy."
3,Very good for price,I got this for a party. It was a lot of fun. I only wish the directions were in a bigger type size. They were very hard to read.
3,Decent Little Board,Scoring games like Cricket and other more complex games are too hard to read on this little board. It is good when your playing 301 etc... Accuracy is excellent and you seldom get a stuck dart electronic issue. I had to upgrade this on to a more cricket pro type though I do still have and use this one when company is over and I set it up on the Patio so we can have more games going
2,okay,"the darts are much cheaper than my previous board, and very disappointed regarding the difficulty seeing the display. you have to look at it from the side close up to see the scoring"
4,fun.. but plastic,put this in my sons room. love the soft tips. no damage on the walls so far so he must be getting better. dont use the electronic tracker as i taught him different games i know.
3,A little disappointed,"I got this dart board from Amazon thinking it would be a little better than what I would find at a local Walmart or Kmart, and Arachnid seemed like a popular brand. When I opened the package today, I was a bit disappointed. It looks like a very cheap toy, and the darts ARE toy darts, with the flights and shafts made as one piece. I know most people will buy their own darts to go with this, but they could at least include the usual 4 peice darts (tip, shaft, flight and grip).I also bought a Halex Crossfire from Walmart for about the same price (around $30 after tax) and it seems much nicer. Comes with nicer darts, has a better mounting system that locks the board to the wall, has a better display and has a cabinet so you can conceal the board when not in use."
3,Got this for a gift,"and its worth the money but sometimes when we play the darts don't register the number we hit. All you have to do is push the dart harder into the board, which is annoying, but overall its fun. Tons of games to choose from etc..."
4,Great for the price!,"Throw away the darts that come with this and buy a decent set for about $7, then you're set to go.The electronics work well, the darts stick well (so well that it takes considerably more effort than you'd expect to pull them out).The battery door snapped off right away, but a little electric tape took care of that. Overall I'm pleased with this purchase."
4,Battleplan,"This is an 18 episode series that looks at basic military strategies such as blitzkrieg, flank attacks and strategic bombing. These are handled very simply, what is interesting is the historical examples (usually 2) given for each. Those interested in military history will like this. I was particularly impressed with the information given on the Son Tay POW camp raid in Vietnam, as I had known little about the actual raid, as well as the Nazi rescue of Mussolini."
1,Great series...poor DVD transfer,"This is a truely great series, which brings alive battlefield tactics and operations, my grip with this set is the ""double sided DVD"" transfer, its cheap and tacky, really disappointed by the quality of this Boxset.Series itself is 5 Star...if you can handle the flipping of the discs then enjoy some of the greates battles of the 20th Century."
2,Uplift series continues to get worse and worse,"Uninteresting world-building, juvenile characters, and absurd plot. David Brin has written one of the all time great science fiction novels (Startide Rising), but nothing of interest in this one."
2,Other Books,"Jijo mojo nogo.A second Uplift trilogy starts here, and unfortunately it is a big old mess. Nowhere near as entertaining or well done as the other three books. The book is set on an alien world that has been settled by a whole bunch of different alien races, and apparently it has all been done on the shonk, in general.Add in a mystery person and perhaps some ties to the other books, but this one needed some serious plot work to make it readable or make you want to go on with the rest."
2,Very Boring,I really enjoyed Brin's first trilogy and bought all three books for this series upfront. What a disapointment! This book was very boring.
2,It leaves you hanging No Satisfaction Don't Bother,This book spends over 700 pages leading up to a big climax that is not resolved unless you read the subsequent books.I usually don't review Bad books on Amazon but I was compelled to with this one. This book is just good enough to keep you reading and then it leaves you hanging by not resolving the cliff-hangers. It's as if in a cheep attempt to get you to read the rest of the books in the series they ripped out the last chapter and made it first chapter of the next book. This is 2nd rate science fiction at best and it doesn't even have any science in it. A very disappointing read. AVOID IT.
4,Great book - stop reading afterwards!,"With ""Brightness Reef"" Brin starts another trilogy in his uplift universe. This time the first book is the best: the multi-species society on JiJo is introduced in a way that gets the reader hooked. The galactics who invade - including the ""Streaker-"" refugees are boring by comparison. Unfortunately they get much of the attention in the following two books. With the first uplift trilogy it was the other way round: the last book - ""Uplift War""- was the best. With the new trilogy the two books following this are a disappointment. Best to stop reading the trilogy after having finished this one."
3,"Good book, worthless to the series","I give this book 3 stars because it is an interesting and well told story as a stand alone. I give it only 3 because it does not add anything of value to the series. Brin wrote his original series promising a secret would be revealed that would completely change his universe. In his second trilogy he essentially creates a new setting so he can write a couple extra books and prolong revealing the big secret. Though I have not read the second and third books yet, at this point I am simply impatient with the series as a whole. Basically this book just opens new questions without providing any new answers."
2,Half the story in thrice the volume,"If you're desperate to read this series, here's a shortcut: Read the first three pages of each chapter.For anyone who's read ""Atlas Shrugged"", you'll recognize the tactic of hideous, layered repetition. Specifically, you'll note that Brin takes the liberty of summarizing The Entire Series again, and again, and again. There _are_ new ideas involved in these books, and that's why I'm handing out the second star, but comparing these to ""Startide Rising"" is like comparing ""Family Matters"" to ""Friends"".Buy the Cliff's Notes if you have to, or find an online summary, or just start with book three (which contains summaries of the important events in the first two). The whole series just isn't worth your time."
2,UGH!,"Could somebody please explain to my why so many of David Brin's novels fail to get interesting until about page 450?I loved the first Uplift Trilogy. I couldn't put it down. Brightness Reef is far from what I expect from Brin. It's slow and choppy and a real chore to finish.I will say that there are a couple of things I do like: I like Brin's ability to create such vivid creatures from so many possible evolutionary paths. In the past his work has been very inspirational to my artwork.The drawbacks of this novel far outweigh the positives, however, and I am only finishing this novel because I have heard the second of this trilogy is very good. This book is boring as heck, however.If you do read Brightness Reef, be prepared for the process to take a couple months and don't be surprised if you find yourself reading (and finishing) several other books before you are done with this one."
2,Not so gloss,"Not the better of Brin's work. I found the pace and character development slow. However, I've found that books written with a trilogy in mind, the first is always the slowest and the second usual picks up the pace. I've started reading the next and hope this is the case."
2,Slow and frustrating,"I was looking for another good sci fi to read after I finished Elizabeth Kerner's ""Song in the Silence,"" I didn't find on in this book. Can you say slow.. I think I finally started to care what happened around page 500 out of a 625 page book. It took way too long to build any rapport with the charecters, and Brin's style of skipping from one charecter's prespective and individual plot line to another added to the muddle. I made me even madder when NO resolution was brought to any of the varied plots, they were all, ""to be continued in the next book ... and then the next book after that."" This was not my best spent use of $6.00 nor will I invest in any more of the triolgy. If anyone feels like summing up what happens, drop me a note."
2,Less uplifting than others,"Brin tried a very different voice for the second trilogy, and I never got more than half-way through this book. It just did not click they way all of his earlier works did."
1,This is David Brin?,"I loved Startide Rising; I bought this in hopes of getting more good David Brin. I threw it in the trash (and I generally consider that act a sacrilege). I found nothing at all redeeming in the story, the characters or the style of this unfortunate addition to the Uplift story."
3,Don't Bother - Stick with the the First Trilogy,"Slogged through this. Unsatisfactory, inconclusive ending. Worse, if you read the reviews for the rest of this second trilogy, apparently it doesn't get better.Brin disappoints much the same way Herbert did with Dune. Great early works and increasingly low quality in subsequent deliverables. Stick with the first trilogy."
3,Put it down many times,I thought Startide Rising and The uplift war were great books!!! They had a nice pace and read easily. The most time it took to read one of them was probably a week from the first time I picked it up until the time I put it down. I am on month two of getting through Brightness Reef at about 400/650 pages. It is still not high paced and although a little faster than the first 400 hundred pages it is still no where near as enticing as the aforementioned books.The fate of Streaker has still not been revieled and after reading some of the reviews here I wonder if I should just put this book to rest and leave it 2/3 finished since the rest of the series doesn't seem to be highly accaimed. Too bad I already bought them =( There are many other books out there that deserve my attention to waste it on a Moby Dick paced book.
1,Turned me off reading,"I was loving my new Kindle for reading but this book is absolutely the slowest thing ever. I have been trying to read this book on and off for over 2 months and I just cannot get into it, no matter how many pages I turn. Unfortunately, I bought the next 2 books in the series as well so I'm stuck with it. Save yourself some money and READ SOME PLOT SPOILERS ON WIKIPEDIA if you want to get into the sequels."
2,Poorly Plotted and Tiresome,"Geez, what a disappointment! I am a huge fan of the first uplift trilogy, but this slow paced behemoth held no interest for me at all. The new elements Brin adds are all half-ideas and loose ends. The characters are wooden. On every page, something seems about to happen, but nothing ever does. And by Brin's own admission, there isn't even an ending to this book, just a pitch to buy the next one. But why would I do that?"
2,disappointing and way too long,"I loved Brin's other Uplift books but Brightness Reef (indeed, the entire trilogy of which it is a part) is a long-winded dud. It introduces a few enticing ideas, but constantly gets bogged down in useless character development and leaves way too many loose ends without resolving anything. This entire trilogy could have easily been condensed into a single volume, and at least two-thirds of the characters eliminated completely, without losing any of the core content. As it is, the three volumes lack continuity and the main ideas and characters introduced in the beginning turn out to have no relevance in the end. NOT RECOMMENDED."
4,"Good story, adequately told","The choppiness of the scenes distracted from the overall scope of the story, rather than enhancing it as the author apparently intended. You go from past to present, which covers a short but undefined period of time - probably about 3 months, back and forth with no clue until you get well into the chapter where you are in the timeline. The characters are fairly well thought out, but not well explored. The concept is quite novel, for me anyway. A planet left fallow to develop its own pre-sentient species through evolution. Bands of refugees from seven races of different physiognomies each come to the planet to hide. After generations of warring amongst themselves, they finally form a common bond and society. Then come some pirates looking to steal some pre-pre-sentient species from the planet. The ersatz natives and the pirates now have to figure out how to keep each other from spilling the beans. Worth a read, but not a must-buy."
2,Disappointing,Brin's books have gone downhill and this is the latest example. Startide Rising was fascinating; Brightness Reef is almost boring. The ideas are great but the snail's pace makes it a struggle to finish. Did the publisher require a trilogy? Wait for the whole thing to see if it gets better before buying this one.
2,disappointing,"I am a diehard Brin fan, but I couldn't get into this book.It goes into detail which is not difficult to understand (ie, doesn't require extra intelligence) just tedious.I buy books to be informed or entertained - this book does neither.If you want an organic sleepng pill try this book."
2,"Turgid, plodding, unimaginative, Brin's agent wrote this","I was looking for a great ""read,"" a book that would take me out of myself and transport me to unimaginable worlds. This book is not it. The plot is mostly nonexistent. The pace plods. The characters are static. The aliens are crudely drawn. It is hard to see where this book might be going. Most important, the payoffs do not come. Not enjoyable, and not recommended."
2,Save some money - Dont buy it!,"I've read all the previous Uplift books and they seemed to be only just above average, however this book really is awful. After trying repeatedly to force myself to complete the book, it became apparent that the plot was dull and I couldnt care less about the characters. In addition to this, like many people I purchased the book in order to find out what happened to the Streaker, and was thoroughly dissapointed.There are a huge number of better books out there that get a lot less attention.The only justification I see for many of these reviews giving high marks is that they have yet read anything better. If you want to something to compare it to, try the Hyperion series."
2,Engaging start that spins into confusion,"As usual, Brin's book starts out complex but terribly engaging, as we are introduced to several highly interesting characters. The middle portion is also excellent as a fascinating story line is brought into play which ties us back to the original Uplift trilogy and brings out new perspectives on the characters to whom we had been introduced. But instead of tieing it nicely into a clean ending, Brin uses the last part of the book to take off on completely unrelated tangents that are not only uninteresting but completely uninspired (The horses are still around? Please! How corny can you get?) At the end of the book he ""apologizes"" for his inadvertant slip that turns this into a trilogy. It seems like more of a commercial set-up to me. I for one, plan not to read the rest of the trilogy out of sheer disgust. David Brin's earlier works are superb. Avoid this mediocre and misleading book if you want to avoid a sour taste"
3,Disappointing if Streaker's fate was top of mind,"If you're looking for the fate of the Streaker, you'll have a really long wait. There aren't even HINTS until the very last bits of this book. If the edition I read hadn't had a teaser for Infinity's Shore I probably would have given this Trilogy up in disgust.Brin likes to jump from one character's point of view to another. Since he generally comes up with some interesting characters, this isn't usually a problem. However, the habit becomes irritating in this book because Brin has chosen to juggle a fairly large cast of characters. As a result, I found that the few really interesting story threads were almost lost among a tangle of mediocre tales.The first Earthclan books (Sundiver, The Uplift War, and Startide Rising) were excellent -- the stories were gripping, the characters interesting, and the premise intriguing. Unfortunately, the first two books of this new trilogy should have been heartlessly and ruthlessly edited back to a single book."
4,Read at least one of the previous Uplift books first.,"This is the fourth book set in an already well-delineated, andamazing, universe. Brin's imagination is unsurpassed; he has goodnarrative skills and a wicked sense of humor (not especially obvious here).Despite being an avowed fan since his first short stories, I found the effort required to read this book annoying. The narrative intersplices the numerous threads of the story in flashes, many so brief as to be strobe-like. More than half the characters are aliens, and ones quite different from any he has previously shown us in this universe, as well as being radically different from humans.Whether your enjoyment of science fiction is predicated on excitement and strangeness, or on meticulous consistency, your investment of time to understand will be repaid by the delights his imagination has created."
4,"A good read, but hold off until the trilogy is complete.","This book is the first third of a grand story, and it shows.The first half of Brightness Reef is a highly descriptive introduction to a large cast of characters and the unique society they have established. Unfortunately, it is not terribly engaging, and would have benefitted from some abbreviation.In stark contrast, the second half of the book was hard to put down. Brin really shows off what he can do, and by the end I was ready to pick up the second installment. I would recommend this book if you're in for the long haul, but you might want to wait for the second and third parts to become available - you'll be dying for more at the end of Brightness Reef!"
5,Hardest game I've ever beat.,"Wow, what a game. The theme is just stupid cool. The soundtrack is pleasing. The gameplay....insanely difficult! Real tough! When I went through this game all the way it was on SNES....it took me 4 months on easy! I had to leave my SNES on for the whole 4 months. I wish I would have had this gameboy version that lets you save:( If you like a challenge, this is truely the game for you."
2,I liked the Genesis version...this one makes me cringe...,"What happened? Why is this game so hard? If you can past even the first level, you're gonna have sore thumbs. The Genesis version was actually FUN, this is not. You gotta be some kind of Super Ghouls 'N' Ghosts supreme hardcore gamer to even beat this game. Matter of fact, has anyone even beat this game yet?..."
3,challenge me,"For YEARS I've heard the stories how this game is supposed to be the hardest, most frustrating game ever made. Does it live up to the hype? Yes, and it delivers in enjoyable gameplay as well.It's not a forgotten masterpiece or anything (any game that has a difficulty THIS extremely high makes it very hard to call it a classic) but for a challenge that's guaranteed to satisfy anyone who dares to accept it, it's a quality game. If anything, Super Ghouls and Ghosts gives us a look back when Super NES games were short and sweet... oh I'm sorry, Game Boy Advance games."
3,There's something not right about this installment of G&G.,"I know what it is now, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT! G&G; games are understandibly difficult, but this goes one step further. You now have to find a braclet to truly defeat Satan at the end. ????....What?!!! It's hard enough just trying to stay alive in this game, but now you have to find a bracelet? Not to mention, if you happen to pass it up, you can't go back to gt it. Then there is a level where you are required to jump to a ledge, before the one you're on falls, but that ledge is concealed. You're expected to phychicly know where it is.It was frustratingly fun to play, but once I beat it and found out about the braclet search, I quickly put it away to collect dust. My sanity is worth more than Princess Gueniever's life. Satan can have her."
4,Really Really Really Hard,This game is difficult. If you manage to get past the third level you are a hardcore gamer. This game rocket science seem easy. i would only recommend this game if your up for the challenge of getting killed after cheap shots and no check points in the middle of the level at all. The frustration level of getting all the way to the boss and dying after a cheap shot and having to start the level all over again is only for someone who wants the glory of saying they beat this game. All i can say is good luck.
1,HORRIBLE,"Now I remember why I hated the original NES version so much. This game SUCKS. WAY too hard - its not even like ""oh, this is so challenging I want to try it again and again."" This game is ""oh, I want to throw my new GBA out the closest f-ing window I can find!"" Arthur moves like he has a stick up his you know what, the monsters can waste his armor and stupidly naked body WAY WAY too easily. Its probably one of the most annoying games I could ever hope to buy, and if it didn't cost me 30 dollars I'd take great pleasure in smashing it violently with a hammer. I gave it the benefit of a doubt b/c it was supposedly new and improved - DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. Maybe I can salvage some of my dignity and sell it on ebay or something...but STAY AWAY unless you like to torture yourself."
4,Book Buddy,"My son loves this fun cuddly book, he carries ""Book Buddy"" around by it's arm! He even lays his head down on the pillow. Contained in the book are 9 pages with the ABC's, fun pictures like a crab in a canoe or a beaver playing a banjo. This cloth book can be easily washed."
4,PLASTIC SCOOP,"Plastic is plastic. This isn't a metal snow shovel. I wouldn't recommend too much heavy snow lifting with this thing, so it doesn't bust. But, it does lift a big sccop of snow off the deck. Don't scrape or try to break ice with it. Using it on concrete wears it out and chews up parts of the blade. It is easy to maneuver, due to the handle."
4,"Good shovel, confusing description","Two quick things, it's actually an ""Artic Blast"" shovel if you are looking for more descriptions online. Mine is blue too for any that care about that. It's a great shovel very similar to the ""Grain Hog"" in style (1680000). However, maybe I misread the description, but I thought it had a detachable handle so I could fit it in my trunk easier. It doesn't, but if you are looking for a sturdy snow shovel and don't need a detachable handle this one is great. Worth the money!Just a hint too I learned from one of my professors. Spray a little Pam on it before using. Snow slides right off!"
5,good and sturdy shovel,Well built shovel with heavy duty plastic shovel and solid wood handle. good value for the money.
2,The heavier grain scoop is better,"I had been using Ames' grain scoop, but it was heavy, so ordered this. The lightweight poly made be easier to lift with a scoop full of heavy snow, but you spend more time and effort as the center of this scoop does NOT lie flat. It humps up a little so that your cleaning swath has a 3-5 inch ""missed"" area in the middle. And you can't leave that missed part because it's just enough that it makes a strip of ice if you do. I went back to the grain shovel."
3,Not quite as advertised,"I ordered the shovel (scoop) as described on Amazon. What I received was a blue True Temper Arctic Blast model. The business end of the shovel has a slight curve to it (as opposed to a flat even edge), which means that it may not make even contact with the surface being shovelled and will likely wear more at the outside ends. If I had seen this on display in a store, I would have moved on to the next one."
3,"Unique bottle, but typical taste.","I've tried several types of ramune soda, and while the packaging is certainly unique compared to the typical twist-cap, the flavors are themselves quite similar to locally available stuff. An interesting item to experience, but not something I'd purchase regularly.A less fascinating package but a more intriguing taste can be found in Clearly Canadian carbonated beverages. I'd suggest giving those a shot once you get bored of playing with your newly discovered bottle-bound marble."
4,at your own risk,"the beverage is delicious but they need to take some safety precautions before they mass market this product of potential death. If you do not puncture the top carefully and instead do it extremely hard while on the phone with an experienced user you will experience what the japanese refer to as ""ramune anger"". Notable side effects include covering oneself the entire interior of one's car in ramune.This product needs more warnings on the side of the bottle and amazon should discontue vending it until these problems are resolved."
5,Fantastic Majestic Medieval Unholy Hymn,"This first official album of Summoning is not for everyone. If you like other Summoning cd's, then it's worth the try. Lugburz is fast, dynamic, and majestic with grinding guitar riff and howling voices. This is definitely the most unholy and dirty Summoning's work. The low sound quality somehow helps to add a particular black metalish flavor to the atmosphere. It's equivalent to ""Wrath of The Tyrant"" by Emperor. If you declare yourself as a black metal fun, then this cd must belong to you. Get it today! (but not from here).RIP"
3,Not High Quality,"Was not expensive and you get what you pay for. The setting was somewhat sloppy (rough under the ""stone"") and very plain looking. It is not too bad but it is obviously fake. I would recommend simply because it is sterling silver. Obviously mass produced. Again I would recommend for the price."
2,Does not look real at all,The smaller size does not matter with this ring it looks super fake! Mine looked so plastics I was embarrassed to even wear it on my right hand. I bought the ring just to try different styles with my wedding bands. The price was right for a trail ring but nothing else. This ring is going in my junk drawer.
3,Pretty but broke in 3 weeks,"I bought this ring 3 weeks ago and the stone already fell out. I'm disappointed. It was pretty, but the part that clamps the jewel down is weak and if you snag it, the prongs bend. Good ring for temp use, but not long term."
4,okay,"pretty nice but is a little thin towards the stone. my wife actually bent the ring because the little CZ got caught on her pocket when she was reaching for her keys. easily bent back but its is not really straight anymore. would i recommend this ring? sure i would, it looks nice and the price is great."
3,Its a okay ring,Its really cheap and looks good. Bought it about 6 months ago and today the stone fell out. Was hoping it would last a year but still not too bad of a ring.
4,Great for the price,"I've had my ring for about 6 months now I wear it as an engagement ring and I have received several compliments on how beautiful it is. The cz still looks brilliant.Keep in mind though that you are getting what you pay for, the band (visible with the palm side of the band) has worn down a little but the top still looks fine. Just be careful of harsh chemicals etc while wearing the ring.And I can say it IS hypoallergenic I'm allergic to most cheapy metals and this ring doesn't bother me at all.It also is a great 5 size fit, I've had some rings that were too small or slightly too loose, this ring doesn't seem to have that problem. The size of the CZ is a great fit too, pretty but not overbearing."
2,To those whi says it looks teal. HA!,"First of all this ring is very small.... It is cute though. I purchase it as a place holder while my wedding rings were being sized. The fit isnt true. I am a 6 and the ring wouldnt stay on top of my finger it rolled aroud. Also, it looks plastic... Nothing real looking about it."
5,good product for the price!,"It's a cute ring for the price. I got this ring as a fake engagement ring that I wear when I don't want to wear my real one (at the beach, pool, etc.) and I like that it comes in my size. It's usually difficult to find costume jewelry that fits my little fingers, so I appreciate this cz ring coming in small sizes. The stone is a nice size so it doesn't look extremely fake (even though it is) or gaudy. It could pass as real from afar. Overall, I'd recommend for purposes like mine, but it may tarnish with everyday use. I'm not sure of this though because I haven't had mine long enough and it's looks good so far."
3,Really cute but looks kinda fake!,It arrived on time! I think it looks cute and it sparkles very nice but it looks fake! I mean what can you expect for the price right? But I do wear it and feel comftable with it!
5,Looks awesome,Looks awesome but proposed to my girl and got shot down. Maybe I'll learn not to propose from now on lol.
1,"""the ring""","I bought this ring to wear as an engagement ring. Well, it is crap. It looks so fake and easily bends at the top."
5,Lovely.,"This ring is classy, adorable, and a perfect size. I love how the band gets smaller towards the rock, and you cant even tell its fake! Its perfect, especially for the price. Sturdy too."
1,This thing made me BLEED,"I will say that this is a nice little ring to have around just to wear and feel pretty and girly BUT, two of the prongs on the setting are so badly bent that I have snagged and RUINED (at least in my opinion) a satin comforter (which did not belong to me) and I scratched my leg AND arm with it so badly I bled, both times... So parents beware if you are buying this ring for a younger child/preteen. Just my two cents :)"
3,The edges are sharp,I love the ring its not a ring that you would want to wear as an everyday ring the claws that hold the stone in are very sharp and get stuck on things and have scratched me
3,Get what you pay for,"I was quite happy that the ring came in a quite timely manner (I had it 2 days after I ordered it with standard shipping). I read the other reviews before purchasing, and decided that I would take a chance since it was so cheap. The ring alone looks pretty good, but when you put it up against any normal white gold/diamond jewelry, you can tell that it's fake. The CZ stone is set a little uneven, but it's VERY slight and you can't tell unless you're studying the ring. If you want to look like you're engaged for an evening out, or an event, then this ring is a good, inexpensive option. If you're looking for something that can be worn continually that no one would suspect is a fake ring then i'd look elsewhere. Overall though, it's a fun inexpensive ring that by itself looks convincingly like the real deal (as long as no one is studying it up close and personal!) The size runs true-- I wear a size 7, and this ring fits just like any other size 7 that I own."
1,Fake fake fake,When I got this ring I was so disappointed. It is SO fake looking. If your looking for something that no one will be able to tell is cubic zirconia look somewhere else. Even the metal band was nasty looking. It just looks so cheap. Waste of 15$ don't buy!
1,cheap looking,"I got this ring in the mail today and when I opened it I knew it was not for me.The whole ring, band and the stone are much smaller then the picture. Not much shineto the stone either. Looks cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Simple,I thougt the ring was gonna be different. Its pretty and really small but not a ring you wear with a band.
4,stunning ring,This ring is a great substitute for a ring I lost. I am wearing this one until I am able to replace the real one.
3,I Like the stone.,Initial disappointment on receipt of the ring. Might be that I had way too much expectations from a ring that I was paying such little for.BUT I must say that as soon as I put it on my finger I was happy that I bought it. The stone looks FABULOUS. It might be too much to say that it could pass off as a real diamond but it sure does look good. The metal could have been made to look better. That is another factor that makes the ring look not so real. An improvement in the craftsmanship of the metal might make the ring look prettier. But on the whole it is definitely a nice buy for such low price.
2,DISSAPOINTED,"The ring looked like I got it from a vending machine. Granted it wasn't much, but I still paid to much for it. The picture makes it look great. My ring wasn't even close to looking like this."
2,poor quality,I bought this ring for my gf. We were very surprised when we find out that this ring was really poor quality. It means not white gold only from some metal and sapphire was really not sapphire but only zircon or something like that.
2,Sterling Silver Ring,"I love how this ring looks but, if you wear it for a long period of time it starts to irritate your finger. The bottom of the diamond is sharp and it sticks into your skin."
4,CZ Ring,"those of you that say that the ring looks just as real as a diamond need to have your eyes checked. from afar, this will do - but up close, especially after wearing it for 2 weeks, it is noticeably fake. the band has started tarnishing and the CZ is somewhat sparkly but i would compare it to a diamond that is of lower quality--a very cloudy diamond. I have seen other CZ with much better quality and was a little disappointed when this arrived. no ""fire"" to it. huge disappointment. could have got this at claire's for $5. This will do though, for what i need it to do--keep the ""creepers"" away when i'm out on the town."
1,outrageous price,This compact can be purchased at any major department store or online at clarins for $36. I can't imagine how anyone can sell this for $86!!!! Beware.
4,An Overview,"This revised edition of Qualitative Methods in Management Research explores and explains the use of this powerful methodological tool. Evert Gummesson refines the basic ideas from the first edition with conceptual developments, updated literature references and current examples from research and practice. The basic challenge of the book remains: Is research in management disciplines -- leadership, corporate strategy, accounting, marketing, organization theory, quality management and others -- taking advantage of the best scientific methods available? The author's answer is: No! Focusing on case study research and the use of qualitative methods for data collection and analysis, the author analyzes the roles and methods used by academic researchers and management consultants when working with change processes in companies and organizations. Readership - Students, professionals and researchers in management, organization studies and qualitative research methods. Management consultants.."
4,Book Review for Qualitative Methods by Dr. Gummesson,"The title of the book should have been ""NEXT LEVEL in Qualitative Methods in Management Research"". Definitely the book is far above the conventional books with similar title. It focuses the problems faced by the researchers in selecting/developing research paradigms and controlling research dimensions. In my opinion this book is also a refresher course for in practice researchers who wish to achieve a next level for their research capabilities.After reading the book I personally felt to be unprivilidged for not completing my Ph.D under the supervision of Dr. Gummesson!"
5,Wonderful Camera,"I wanted to purchase a camera to upgrade the Olympus D460 Zoom camera I owned. After some research, I purchased the Olympus D-565, and I am extremely happy with it. It solved the old issues I had with the D460. The startup time of the camera is extremely fast, and it is ultra-compact. The picture quality is excellent in both bright or low-light environment. The D-565 only uses 2 AA batteries, and the battery life is better than the D460. I am extremely happy with my purchase, and highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to purchase a quality digital camera for under $300."
4,Best bet for your buck on 4 MPs !!!!,"At first, I was pretty disappointed with the picture quality.3-4 pictures out of every 10, came out blurry! So make sure you read that manual before you get started! D-565 is just a bit more than a ""point & shoot"" camera and if you learn how to use it, you will love the crisp picture quality and it's ease of use! Alkaline batteries are totally out of question as this camera has really been designed to use rechargeable NiMH or CR-V3 Batteries. My rechargeable Kodak NiMH batteries can take a good 150 pictures before they run out of juice. The only two negative things about this camera in my opinion are:-The auto focus is relatively slow.-The Low Battery warning will start flashing too early when the batteries are still almost half way full.Aside from the minor things above, I think this camera is probably the best bet for your buck on 4MPs."
2,"Horrible compared to the CANON, MINOLTA, & PENTAX!","A lot of my pictures were blurry, slow for focusing, no audio!#The only thing I liked is that it's compact, cute looking, water proofish, & uses XD card."
5,Great product!,"I bought this product for my pygmy hedgehog and it is the perfect size. Strong construction, large area to move around in and collapsible so it can be stored. I'm very happy with it!"
2,Had to change the rating because frame broke,"In the beginning this guest bed was doing pretty well. My older mom would sleep on it for days without any complaints. However, after about a month the frame simply broke.It is no use without the frame, because the mat is very thin. If you want something that will last, better pick a more expensive one."
1,Terrible Construction,The construction is terrible. My brother visited for thanksgiving. I found him sleeping on the floor the next morning on just the pad. The frame bent on the cot the very first night.
5,More than I had hoped for,I am making a trip to Morocco in a few months and would like to look at rugs - this book is an excellent reference. I am reading about the history of the rug-making tribes and learning about their different methods and styles. The book is beautiful with stunning photographs and complete information. It is really a great source for me.
3,An Ok product,They work well to keep the heat out. they have an awkward fit and grip on the items removed from the oven.Easy to clean
1,DO NOT BUY WITHOUT GREASE FITTING,"HAD BRUTE FORCE U-JOINT , LASTED 4 YRS , BUT ONLY DROVE 28000 MILES , NO GREASE FITTING , NOT GOOD, HAD LIFETIME WARRANTY AND RETURNED DEFECTIVE , AND GOT A MOOG BRAND WITH GREASE FITTING , LIFETIME WARRANTY , COST ME $2.00 AFTER STORE CREDIT, BRUTE CREDIT. COMMON SENSE > BRUTE INSTALL A GREASE FITTING , THATS A NO BRAINER."
4,Great value for money!,The sound from these KLH speakers are very good. The delivery from Amazon.com to the US address was very prompt and on schedule. I have been an Amazon.com customer for the last 7 years and I am more than satisfied with the service received!
5,Best suits my need.,"Initially I bought JBL E35 center speaker, it was good but too heavey to place it on a TV OR it took more space on my entertainment center. This one is just the right size and weight to place it on a TV (scotch strip hold them!), voice is very clear and powerful, some time better than JBL. Very glad with the purchase."
5,nutrient and delicious,"I like Cerelac product, they tast good and have a lot of variety. my daughter like is better than any other brand. thank you Amazon for bringing this item."
3,It's Ok,It's exactly as advertised. Will work for one person. I wish it were a little more sturdy though.
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I bought this as I went through a backpacking phase and spent a lot of time perfecting alcohol stoves. I got this at walmart for about $11, which seemed like a deal. The problem is they don't stand up to any kind of use. The plastic lid on the pan lid would get soft enough every time I used it to cover boiling water that it would deform to the touch. Everything bent. If you put food in a pan, it would bend. If you set a pot of water boiling on an alcohol stove, the outer edges will lower and bend down. After a couple uses the lid didn't fit anything, and I didn't trust anything to hold food without causing an accident."
2,Way to thin !,"I had a boy scout mess kit back in the 70's and it was made in USA, strong enough to hold up to the task it was designed for. This Coleman mess kit is a $10 toy not to be used for real. OK, thats kinda harsh, but Im telling it like it is. This trully is way underbuilt (way to thin). When I ordered it I was hoping it was a great ""value"", was I wrong !! If it seams to good to be true, it probably is. They will be sent back (sorry Coleman, sorry China )."
1,Just junk,"There isn't much to say about this set. Its super light. It doesn't heat evenly, its flimsy, the lid doesn't sit well, the bowl is odd shape, and the cup handle is not ergonomic at all. The one time I cooked it in there was the slightly aluminum taste in the food. It just doesn't really work. Your hard earned cash is better spent on a nice cast iron frying pan, and if needed larger pot for boiling water for your camping needs."
5,Great Mess Kit,"I love this mess kit! Provides all you need to cook a meal. All the pieces nest together making it compact. It is made of thin gauge aluminum, consequently it is very lightweight. More importantly the thin gauge aluminum transfers heat very efficiently to contents that will heat up quickly. Very important when you have a limited heat source. Saves fuel, be it butane, propane, wood, whatever.One big improvement/addition I suggest to this mess kit is a ""pot gripper"" handle. The included pot handle/mess kit stay only fits one pan and is somewhat flimsy.REI sells a universal ""pot gripper"" that will work with all the containers in this mess kit and only costs $4. Well worth it.Mark"
4,For the price...,"Really, for the price, this product is a great buy. If you're looking for something reliable and functional for long periods of time... look elsewhere. This is your standard ""boy scout"" standard issue mess kit. Coleman has never let me down over the years, and I still stand by that statement. Coleman offers a good backup-quality mess kit for a price not ever worth haggling over. [buy it]"
2,kinda cheap,"well, it is lightweight and easy to use but the aluminum is cheap, bends easily, takes on soot badly...i gues it would be nice for a child but it isnt for serious camping."
3,light wight and thin,these are ok but are really thin metal so indirect heat is recommendedit doses fit well in my (b.o.b bag)
3,cheap but servicable,if you need something cheap and servicable thes work but I encouarge you to save up for higher quality things to cook your food in.they do take a lot fo abuse and keep on working and everything nests together well. The whole package is fairly light for what you get.
3,Not Bad/Not Great,"My boyfriend and I got this to take with us this summer on our camping trips. I like that fact that it's small and compact. The whole set will fit nicely in with our gear without taking up a lot of room. Haven't use it yet, but don't see any problems with the set. It's not something to make a huge family dinner with, we plan on using it for things like hot-dog sauce. Also, the storage bag in the picture does not come with kit. All in all its fine with us. If you want something to last for a long time than invest in a higher dollar kit, this should last us the summer and for the price, that works just fine for us!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Put it in my backpack on top of everything else, when i opened it, the thing was bent all to hell."
2,Disappointment,"This is much smaller than it looks, and as soon as I tried to cook on the frying pan, it folded up in the middle. The pot is too small for pack of Ramen."
3,Decent mess kit,"Ordered this for my sons boy scout outings. I did not expect much when ordering it, thought it would just last a year or so and I was right. Dented in his Teton Sports pack even though it was on top of everything but easily pushed back into place. Everything compacts together nicely though. Maybe in a few years will get a real nice one for him."
2,Barely Functional,"While the Amazon price is great, this lightweight aluminum mess kit is just not good enough for heavy camping use. We also bought the more expensiveTexsport Stainless Steel Mess Kitand are much happier with that kit.Here are my observations on this disappointing Coleman Kit:Pros -+ Folds up nicely for easy transporting+ Mug is actually kinda niceCons -- Frying Pan handle is secured in place with a ""wingnut"" and is so thin that it bends with any weight in the pan- Pot Lid is flimsy and poorly fittingNot Recommended!CFH"
3,Fits in pack,"Purchased for backpack addition. The pros are very light weight, compact and fits together good. Cons the cup will burn your lip with hot liquids and the pot tips when picked up by handle. Top and bottom are the most useful. For the price you can not lose."
3,Great Cheap Kit,"For the price you can't get any better. it will get the job done yes. When I use it though I find that the pot and skillet is too small, food sticks easily (which can be a pain to wash if camping), it is a loud addition to a backpack and the handles are no good. It isn't a good mess kit, but if you need something cheap.... this one will work."
3,Make sure you're alone,"I didn't pay much attention to the dimensions of the items in this kit, I should have broke out the measuring tape. This stuff is tiny! It might be good for very small meals for one person or child but for two adults its just too small. The largest piece may be able to cook 4 eggs at best, and the pan might be able to cook a can of something as long as its a normal can not one of the jumbo cans of beef stew or something.I gave it three stars, for three reasons, it's dirt cheap, it probably would be perfect for one person who doesn't eat much, and it all fits into itself in a great little compact item which would be perfect if you're trying to save space."
1,POS,"Flimsy like a coke can. Bends in your pack. To small to cook the 2 cups of water required for most freeze-dried nasty dinners. Seven bucks down the drain, what was I thinking? I bet it would melt on a higher BTU stove, or with 3 matches lit at the same time. I will recycle this kit when I return my coke cans."
2,fell apart after one use,I was hoping to get a bit more durable product but after only one use these all fell apart and had to toss them out.
4,Very Light and Compact,"I was very impressed with this from the moment I took it out of the packaging. First of all, VERY fast shipping, ordered Friday and received Monday! Also, very light and pretty compact, Overall great kit, only reason I gave it 4 instead of a 5 is that the handle is very easy to bend by your own strength. Should hold up to a decent amount of weight in the pan though...."
2,"Coleman, you disappoint me.","Not the same quality of some years ago, not wort even the cheap price, better save some more and get a better quality product. Ok for like kids playing camping in the back yard, and maybe."
2,love coleman but this is borderline useless..,To say it simply the metal is too thin for actual flame use. The metal will bend and you will either burn yourself catching it or spill your rations. I cannot see any other use for this except as a pet food bowls. Do not buy.
2,no bueno,"Mal producto, inutil para cualquier cosa, no sirve ni para juguete de ninios, no lo devolvi porque no valia la pena es dinero tirado."
2,Questionable Quality,"I didn't expect a thick titanium camp cooking set from this $8 deal, but it has to be usable at least. The handle is made with extra-thin metal with barely support itself when filled with water, the connection screw was also a disaster. The other pans and sets are just too small to cook(the cup can barely hold One-Shot Espresso coffee). I was shocked by a product with such quality, but the price was there so I give it 2-star."
3,Coleman Aluminum Mess Kit,"You get what you pay for here. Very light-weight(not sturdy) basic mess kit. Discolors sigificantly if washed in a dishwasher. I don't expect it will last long and will be looking for something more substantial in the future, however, for the price paid it works as advertised."
1,!cheap!,Someone is pretty crafty to form this all outta aluminum foil ! I figured it would be a little betterQuality but guess it sometimes don't pay to be cheap. Buy the stainless steel! I wasted my money don't do the same!
2,One Time Use,"I bought this product a local gun/outdoor store. It was only $4 and I thought it would be decent to cook a few meals.They are cheaply made and bend/dent easy.Once you burn something, the thing is trash.I suppose you can use it for an emergency in your car."
1,Stupid. It melts!,"I found this mess kit very obsolete to other mess kits I've had in the past. I mean, I didn't expect much for the price, but you would be much better off spending 10 more dollars on a mess kit that really works. This kit MAY work for the young Boy Scout who will only use it once or twice, however the hardcore camper will be very dissipointed.Pros - lightweight, cheap, kids will accept itCons - pot too small, cup too small, too lightweight (it'll melt), very flimsy, scraches far to easly, pot will flip over on itself if you try to pour liquid from it, handle will bend from weight of food when connected to the frying panI highly reccomend spending a little more money on a real mess kit than saving a few bucks getting this one. It doesn't work in the real world."
3,"Works but, seems small and cheap.","I knew the price was low but, I was expecting the set to be more substantial. Especially because of the Coleman brand. It is ity bity small and flimsy but, it does work. Just don't get your hopes up that you can prepare an entire meal in these."
1,Too easy to lose handle screw,"This looked like a good buy for a camp mess kit. Unfortunately, it is hard to open and close because the handle that holds every thing in, is held by a screw. I found it hard to open and I overloosened the screw which then dropped out of the handle and I could not find it. The kit was hard to put back together anyway as the pot handle didn't fold right. Not a good buy. I recommend that if one purchases a mess kit, that they get one which the handle folds rather than screws together. The handle makes it easy to use and a folding handle is easy to open and there are no parts that can be lost."
4,A great surprise!,"I bought this item almost as a joke because it was so cheep and so lightweight that I thought it would be junk. I figured that even if it was useless I wouldn't feel bad about throwing it out because of the price. What I found was that this little set actually works very well. I was impressed with the weight and it cooks a great steak and cleans easily. It packs up pretty small too.My only two concerns with this product was that1. Because the frying pan is two pieces and aluminum the handle tends to bend with too much weight. Long term I think bending will greatly weaken the handle.2. The handle of the frying pan can get a little hot if left on the heat for more than a few minutes. Still easily handled with a towel or shirt sleeve.These are the prices you pay for the very light weight and cheep price. All in all though, a great bargain that really works."
1,Junk,"Despite being very light weight, this is not worth the money. The handle for the pan gets very hot, and isn't strong enough. The pot, when filled with water and lifted from the handle, will tilt over sideways and spill water everywhere.I did not expect much when I bought it, but I had hoped it would at least be functional."
3,Low quality,This is a low quality aluminum mess kit. I give it 3 stars because it does what it says it should. I'm just a little disappointed in the build quality.
3,Thin metal,"You can bend this thing with your fingers. Pretty light weight, not very durable. I would consider a few dollars more and get something with size and durability."
2,Would not take backpacking,"I bought these because I needed some cheap aluminum cookingware. I thought Coleman made pretty good stuff but this stuff is a joke. The aluminum handle on the frying pan is held with a single wing nut. If you do not tighten it enough, the pan will turn and spill. The rivets that hold the pan on are way too weak, I feel the whole handle assembly sag with no weight on it! The rest of the kit is just as poorly made, I would not trust it backpacking or even on a camping trip. I couldn't recommend this in either of those situations."
3,smaller than i imagined,"I suppose it will work for backpacking trips for one maybe two if they are light eaters, it is compact and ultralight which was why I originally purchased it. Coffee cup is a joke maybe if u only want a sip it will suffice. Id honestly pay a little more to get a more suitable set. This one is a skip, search elsewhere as I am going.g to do."
4,The basic mess kit,"This mess kit is truly the basic kit. It includes the cup, a tiny pot with anti-tip tabs, the fry pan, & cover / dish. Light weight, compact. I like the way it fits together and latches securely. The ony delta is that it is made of very light grade aluminum. The pan handle is very soft and bends easily. My son uses this kit for scouting."
2,Flimsy Aluminum,I bought this assuming it would be of similar quality and weight to older (50's) Scout set I have. I was disappointed. It is light and flimsy in comparison and I will not use.
1,Aluminum is BAD!,Never cook with or eat out of aluminum pots & pans! Google Aluminum poisoning or Aluminum toxicity and you will see why. It will make you sick and stupid and maybe sick of being stupid too! People who make aluminum food pots or put aluminum in their edible products should be shot.Stainless is much better! It is more expensive and heavier but it won't poison you! Some choices have severe unintended concequences!
1,Colemen Aluminum Mess Kit,"I found it ""Educational"". I now know Coleman moved to China (even though I suspected as much). I will NEVER KNOWINGLY buy anything made in China or any other COMMUNIST Nation. I would never use this product for cooking or eating however I DID find other ""uses"" for this stuff. As for Coleman Products? Never again."
3,thin mess kit,"it came on time, but dented, kinda of thin. popped out the dents and seems fine. had these as a kid in boy scouts not the same quality"
3,Just OK,"I should have been more careful reading the review, but I was disappointed with how small all of the items are. Make sure you don't make the mistake I did and check that out first.Not counting my stupidity against the product, it is not a bad value for what you pay for. All five items pack nicely into one small shape, but like other reviewers, I hate how much noise the kit makes when you walk with it. If you are looking for a mess kit for one person and don't mind the noisy sounds of the aluminum kit, this would be a great buy. Me, looking for a mess kit that could provide a meal for 2 people and pack quietly in my backpack, am wishing I invested more in a nicer kit."
3,So So,"Its a decent kit. A little flimsy and dents from pressure. It cleans pretty easily with water. It's very light and small. The handle of the whole thing is held together with a butterfly nut and screw... My biggest problem is that the nut MELTED when put in the fire. Now I needa go out and get a real nut to replace it. By melted, I mean a puddle of metal where it should have been."
1,no product pride,this kit is a joke its so thin and weak. i didnt trust the handle and tested it when any weight was put in it the handle bent. i dont even want to waste time with this junk on fire it would be full of holes
2,You get what you pay for,"The only thing this kit is useful for is cooking something in another pot or pan and then merely using this kit as a container on which to hold / eat your food. Sure, it's light, but it is also horribly made. It bends under little pressure, and it got warped after the first use, so it packs loose and falls apart at the slightest nudge.Coleman makes many great products... This is just not one of them."
1,Too small and thin,"We should have read the reviews before buying.. They are very small, thin and cheap looking.. Planning to return them."
4,Grandma Review,"Bought this trike for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves Dora but this trike with its low profile looked especially safe. It has lived up to our expectation. It does not tip over, and is easy for her to climb onto without assistance. Only problem was Dora picture for the front of the bike did not have great attachments and is now in the toy box :)"
3,A disappointment,"This DVD was a disappointment because the label leads the viewer to the impression that the DVD is about the Grand Canyon. In face, the Grand Canyon is only seen slightly in this video. The video spends most of its time featuring the Colorado Plataeu, of which the Grand Canyon is a part of. The video also spends time featuring other national parks in the immediate area like Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, etc. Don't get me wrong, the vistas on this Blu-ray disc are spectacular. I only wished that the disc had spent most of its time in the Grand Canyon itself."
2,Very poor,"This video was an shame for everyone involved. The audio mix was poor, video wasn't stable. Must have been done on a real tight budget."
2,maybe looks better in DVD,"I own similar titles like this: Planet Earth, Life etc. The image quality of this Bluy Ray is by far the worse of my whole colection. It is very educational, that it is fine, but the image in the 70% of the movie unacceptable."
5,A book That Inspires You to Succeed!,"As one of the authors in this book series, I can tell you that each story will inspire you to succeed through all the challenges of life! This book gives numerous examples of success! Because all of us know, that if you ask 100 different people what it means? You will get 100 different answers!I highly recmmend that you purchase your copy today! In it, I share part of my amazing life story of overcoming numerous obstacles which most people would have given up on. I end it with my definition of success:""Success is never a 1-part mission nor is it a 1 man show. But it is a life long series of accomplished goals, tasks and events. It is a constant process of life which never ends unless we allow it to by; settling for less, giving up, living our lives through what others say or by not using the skills, talents, gifts and opportunities God has blessed us with!""- Written By Carolyn J. GambleMotivational & Inspirational Speaker, Author & Empowerment Coach"
4,A wide variety of advise....and viewpoints. Worthy of your time!,"The book has a variety of viewpoints on everything from sharing, exercise, health, success, etc....and while you may not agree with everything in this book, especially things of spirituality, you're sure to get lots of valuable ideas out of this book. An easy read, with plenty of ""meat and potatoes"" with some ""light eating"" as well."
3,"Well, there are some pretty mixes here...","I'm gonna be honest here. Having a few of her albums beforehand I expected this to be the bomb. It came up short. There are some pretty mixes here but there are also some really weird ones. There's a tune here towards the beginning that had production that freaked me out. It was so weird!So overall, I think this is ONLY FOR Rachael Lampa completists (and this is coming from a fan). This collection of songs at best can make you dance but at worst will leave you pressing the skip button. It's not your typical remix collection. Some of the material is bangin' though.3.5 stars."
5,A Very Cool Album!!,"You gyz should definatley get this CD!! The Remixes are greatand the songs a totally cool.You'll just want to play this album all over again!For those who were disapointed with RachaelLampa's Kaleidoscope,you should definatly get this album!Blurs the BOMB!!"
4,Rachael's Newest,"The remixed songs on this album are really great and enjoyable! Rap must be pretty ""in"" these days because it's sprinkled sparingly throughout the album, although the remix of the beautiful song ""Free"" contains more rap than there is of the song unfortunately. My two favorite songs are the remixes of ""I'm All Yours"" (featuring the group Souljahz) and ""Live For You"" which has been transformed into a fast dance-type song. Any Rachael Lampa fan should own this album as long as you don't mind the rap and being addicted!"
5,This remix album rocks!,"I loved this cd by Rachael Lampa. Just as I thought her music couldn't get any better Blur is released. I recommend this album if you like Christian music and want something you can dance to. Free, Savior Song, and I'm all yours are examples of that. If you are into pop music like Christina Aguilera then Rachael Lampa is for you."
4,Little girl fun!,What little girl doesn't want a doll house? This is nice because it closes up for easy storage or for taking to Grandma's house.
5,super fun take along dollhouse...,"very fun dollhouse, my daughter has had hers for years now. we sent one to my friends daughter and she loves it as well. the kids find cool ways to play with it and as all playmobil it is extremely durable..."
3,Smaller than expected.,"The Take Along Dollhouse was a bit of a disappointment to me,but I'm the grandmother,so I'm not there to see how my granddaughter responds after the party. The house itself was rather skimpy inside and the little twin beds barely fit in the bedroom. Also the figures of the children were so very small as were many of the accessories which also had to be assembled, a tedious task which my son devoted about a half hour to while our little girl waited to be able to play with it. I had hoped for something better considering the Playmobil name. I probably would not buy it again if I had seen it before she opened it. For the price, I would have chosen something else."
4,Cute little first doll house,"My son received this for his third birthday. He loves it, especially as an addition to toys he already plays with (this house has been a train station, restaurant, and the home of Sir Topham Hat.)It is cute and since the details are all stickers, there aren't lots of things to be broken.One problem would be the many, small accessories. I have had to put them away because while my three year old isn't likely to put them in his mouth, his one year old brother is. The baby, baby carriage, books, dishes, etc, are in a little box that he can pull out when his baby brother is napping.All around great first doll house."
1,Waste of money,"This ""pillow"" is the size of my hands put together and has the fluffiness of a couple cotton balls in a ziploc bag. Given the price it wasn't worth returning, I will probably give it to my dog as a toy. I think air filled pillows might be the way to go for ultralight backpacking, this I assure you is not the way to go..."
3,"Handy, but it rusts","This was very handy on our last camping trip. It frees up space on the picnic table or whatever surface you happen to be cooking on. The shelf is sturdy and engages the camp stove very well. It rained several times over our camping weekend and by the time we got packed up, the unit was starting to rust. I was a little disappointed in this."
4,"Ultra marathon Man 50 Marathons, 50 states",I must admit I was slightly disappointed with this film although that is from a personal perspective. I ran one of the marathons in Vermont with Dean and was totally thrilled to do so. I thought the film for me did not fully represent the excitement I felt while following the actual event(s) in real time. I understand the difficulty of compressing 50 marathons into a 2 hour movie though. So I think for most people it will be a positive and inspirational film to watch. Nothing can take away from Dean's amazing accomplishment.
5,Runners' High,UltraMarathon Man takes viewers on an emotional journey like no other. We watch as Dean Karnazes attempts to run 50 marathons in 50 states in 50 days. Beyond the physical challenge is the incredible beauty of where he runs and with whom. This film is inspiring for all who dream of doing something seemingly beyond human abilities.
5,Amazing story,"Dean is amazing and inspirational. After reading his bookUltramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night RunnerI had to see this DVD. The stories of other runners are unbelievable. If you are a runner searching for inspirational DVD, this is one to get. I would also recommendSpirit of the Marathon."
4,One of the best anime soundtracks...,"...I have ever had the pleasure to own. It is only surpassed by the double CD set 'City Hunter Digital Master II' (which earned 5 stars from me).The whole album captures the vibe of the anime (and the end of the '80s) perfectly. Plus it has some dialogue at the beginning of a few songs.For those of you who don't understand a word Japonese, this might not be one of the best traits on this album, but at least you can enjoy the vocal acrobacies of the great Kamiya Akira (the seiyuu for Saeba Ryo).So sit back, relax and let this great album carry you back to the '80s. You won't regret it."
1,Irrational readings for political reasons,"As a scientist, I am embarrassed and outraged that this tome contains a myriad of errors and makes a number of outrageously hilarious statements: for example, the authors claim that acid rain is beneficial because it removes ""unwanted"" organisms from lakes and streams, and thus creates a ""pristine environment"" for swimmers and bathers. Of course, this ignores the effects of acid rain on ecosystem functioning in terms of multi-trophic interactions and ultimately, stability. Other topics are handled in a similarly contemptible fashion. This book is a perfect example of science distorted to support a political agenda. Certainly, its one of the LEAST scientific books on the subject that I have read in a long, long time."
4,No Doubt,"There is No Doubt that Steven McCoy and Greater Purpose are a group that's on the rise. The songs help usher in the presence of God. My favorite songs include No Doubt, Desire, Heaven Belongs to You, The Blood, In the Presence of the Lord, Draw Me, and Great and Mighty. The harmonies are tight and really nice. This group of young adults definitely have a Greater Purpose."
