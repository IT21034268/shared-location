2,not for me,"This was the first monitor we used when our son was born, given to us as a shower present. I think it lasted about 5 months in our home before it turned to all static, and that was only using it at night. We went out and purchased a different brand and have had hardly any problems with the new model as compared to this one."
3,"Great range, not so good reception","We have been using this monitor for 2 years now, and I have a mixed review. On the positive side, it does have great range. We have sat out in the yard, even in the next door neighbor's yard and still get confident reception. But while sitting right on our kitchen counter we get lots of interference. We have picked up other people's phone calls, as if we were on the line with them. We also have received our neighbors baby monitor, or just intermittent static. All in all, 90% of the time this monitor works great."
3,"Not bad, but not the best",This was the first monitor we bought. It wasn't bad. It did the job but after a while it got on our nerves that it was all the static noise not the baby that was keeping us awake! So we took it back and exchanged it for the Sony Babycall.I wouldn't discount this monitor as it works better for some than others and I think to be realistic you are always going to hear static. But the Sony is way better in my opinion.
1,This is a horrible product.,"A perfect example of you get what you pay for. After trying everything to get rid of the constant static, I finally gave up and I'm now shopping for another product. When using my cordless phone, the monitor would pick up the signal. The signal is terrible, and the constant static in the middle of the night is enough to make one go nuts. Spend the extra $10.00, it's worth the piece of mind!!!"
1,"The name ""Crisp & Clear"" is a joke!","We bought this monitor because we read it was good last year in several places. Based on our experience, it was not a good product at all. There was so much interference which we (at first) blamed on different legitimate things (airplanes, phones, appliances plugged in nearby). The reception was so bad when you were talking at a loud voice in the nursery, you could only hear mumbling and not understand a word being said. We finally decided there was no legitimate excuse for all the probolems when my husband had it on and was sitting in the porch swing. The interference flared up as he was swinging back and forth! That was riduculous so we returned it and got the Fisher Price Vibrating Monitor instead - same price, and boy is it so much better. Absolutely no interference or static and you can hear and understand every single word whispered in the nursery. With all the problems it would be smart to not bother buying this monitor at all."
3,Better luck with other brand,"I purchased this monitor while expecting my 2nd child. I currently use another brand for my toddler and have never had any issues with static, etc. I found compared to the current monitor I use, that the sound quality on this one was very poor with little depth to the sound. It was difficult to discern normal crib movement versus him making noise. It frequently got interference and turned to static even though I use it in the next bedroom over! I did like the small, slim and convenient size though. I ended up returning it and purchasing another brand."
1,Too Much Static and I Own Two Sets,"I don't have one but two sets of this monitor. I have one for home and one for the office. I have been tempted to throw both of them out the window. Both sets of this monitor have static even when they are only 25 feet apart. Like one of the reviews I read - one minute they are clear and then next they are all static. They also have have a tendancy to have a ""beep"" of static at all times which is highly irritating. I have no close neighbors and have eliminated the cordless phone in an attmept to get rid of the static - no luck. I can not honestly list anything about this monitor that I like."
4,"It's been dropped,dunked,crunched and keeps on working well!","We purchased this monitor over three years ago because of its range, sound clarity, battery/rechargable battery backups...the latter a very big plus when the power goes out or when traveling.This thing has been dropped on our hardwood floors, stepped on, fell in the water. It's taped up with Scotch Tape, the antenna is broken, half the lights are broken from the falls, but it still works very well!Only on a couple of occasions did it pick up an airplane tracking beacon...but that hasn't happened in quite a while and it only happened at one specific spot at our house.Shame nobody makes them out of rubber!We're buying another one for our newborn and will retire this poor ole sole as a backup."
2,Looking for a new monitor after 2 months,"After just 2 months we are shopping for a new monitor. Though I can hear my daughter sucking her thumb, I can no longer take the static, buzzing, clicking and other noises that keep me awake. I've tried different channels and different positions to no avail, I would not recommend this model."
1,Worst monitor,This is a terrible monitor -- lots of interference and minimal range. I would recommend holding onto your sales receipt for this one.
2,Less Than The Best,"I normally love ""The First Years"" products, but have been less than pleased with this monitor. I like the rechargeable batteries, the light display and that the base and receiver can both run on batteries. However, it has not been very useful for me because of the static and feedback that occur often enough to be annoying (and loud when you have the volume turned up). It does pick up well if you are only a room or two away, but then why use a monitor? I really need it for outside, but it looses its signal two feet from the door. I am looking for a new monitor tomorrow and feel this one was a waste of money. I'm a little confused how one product can get such opposing reviews, so maybe it has something to do with where you live.???"
1,Crummy Monitor,"This monitor has so much interference and static it isn't worth having a monitor! We saved our reciept and are now looking for another monitor. Don't buy this one if you live in a heavily populated area, use a cordless phone or fans in your house. In general, a big disappointment!"
4,Great except for load burst of static once in while,This monitor works great most of time. It picks up the slightest sounds of baby at night. The unit has alot of great features like rechargable batteries. The one problem is that it puts out load bursts of static for no apparent reasons. The price was competitive for what you get. We live in a suburban area.
2,I Hate this monitor,"I had a Fisher Price monitor that died after 20 months of use, so I bought this one because of the great reviews. It is too loud on the lowest setting (I get a loud hum from my air conditioner), and there is constant crackling from it all night long! I am returning this monitor as soon as I can! It has too much power for its own good."
1,Static Monster,"I have two cordless phones in the house, a 2.4GHz and a 900 MHz. The monitor was unusable when I was on the 900 MHz phone as the monitor emitted a very loud static noise when I turned the phone on. I don't have this problem with the 2.4 MHz, but this still presents a problem. Back to the store!"
1,Terrible Monitor,This is the absolute worst baby monitor. It is very noisy. The reception is terrible. It makes this horribly loud screeching sound all the time. I would not recommend this monitor to anyone. The First Years needs to take this monitor off the market and improve it.
1,Static,"We had to return this product immediately. Just like the ""Baby Bargains"" book said, all we heard was static. We switched to a Fisher Price monitor and have been very happy."
1,Will be returning this item,"I registered for this monitor since I saw it highlited in Baby Bargains book, had rechargable batteries and it was rather inexpensive but am very disappointed with it's performance. I can not hear my daughter breathing and have to put the unit up to my ear to hear well. I also hear a lot of buzzing and frequently it goes out of range when the receiver has not even been moved!!"
1,Babies R Us brand is better,"I own this changing pad cover as well as the Babies R Us brand. I thought the Sealy would be better, but I was wrong. The terry is not as soft as the BRU brand, and it frays alot. The BRU brand is soo much better."
2,square peg - round hole,"Simmons also makes the changing pad. So in thoery you would think they would work well together right? Wrong the pad has straps - the covers have no holes for the straps (except the white ones). So the straps and now incorrectly placed. And they fit the first one or two times I washed them now its the changing pad is all squished down it shrunk ALOT.Even though I am not thrilled with this product, I still use it as there really is no alternative. Buy a bunch of the white ones, use a cheap colored hand towel to lay on top and it'll look pretty and match your decor.(One more tip - you may WANT to use bleach after a bad accident so white really is the better choice)What are you going to do - LOL not change the little one....."
1,SHRINKAGE!!!,"I put this pad cover on the pad before I washed it, just to make sure if fit correctly. It did...before washing that is. I washed and dried this item according to the instructions and it shrunk alot! The fabric isn't stretchy either. So, I'm stuck with 4 pad covers that are useless. Don't waste your money. Use one of the 100 flannel receiving blankets you were given to wrap around the pad. They're easy to remove and throw is the wash."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"When I was a brand-new mom, eager to color-coordinate my baby's nursery, I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available. Good thing I bought so many, because each time baby oozed, leaked, squirted, spit up, fountained, or otherwise made a baby mess, I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes, then remove the pad cover, toss it in the wash, and put a new cover on. Doesn't sound like much work, but considering how many messes babies can make, changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore. On top of that, the terrycloth just doesn't clean well, even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout! It's much easier (and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser. Don't waste your money buying pad covers."
2,What's the point?,"Save your money and just use an old, soft towel instead. You can still tuck the edges under the pad and bring the straps around. Why spend this much on a thin piece of terry cloth?"
2,"Looks good, feels bad","Although this changing pad cover looks nice and soft, after a few washings it feels a little rough and no longer fits the changing pad without crushing the sides. I found much better ones at k-mart for half the price that seem to never shrink."
2,Not Necessary,I used mine for the first week. Now I just lay down cloth diapers or burp clothes. These keep the changing pad clean and cut back on the laundry bulk. I too have the same complaints about durabilty. I hope to use it later on when baby has fewer accidents.
2,"Okay, but not great.","These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings. In addition, the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides. Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers, but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top. This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often."
2,The covers do not fit the changing pads!,I purchased the Simmons 16X32 changing pad and a couple of the Simmons 16X32 pad covers. To my disapointment after washing the covers they do not even come close to fiting over the changing pad. They are about 3 inches short. When you try to put them on it makes the pad bend and not lay flat. Not to mention there are no holes for the safety straps to fit through.
1,"Don't bother, cover not necessary","I love the contoured changing pad, but the cover can be used about one time without getting pooped on and then it has to go in the washer. The pad itself has a wipe-off surface, so I just put a cloth diaper down, it is much easier to clean that way!"
2,"Try Rumble Tuff Covers, They Fit","Rumble Tuff covers, not available here, fit right even after many washings and dryings and they don't fall apart."
5,a great item,"keeps baby's skin warm, rather than putting them directly on the cold changing pad surface. i have washed it several times, and it handles well in the washer/dryer."
2,Don't buy!,"This changing pad cover shrinks upon first wash... after first wash, it'll fit, but extremely tight. Second wash it will NOT fit at all..."
4,Nice cover to go with Simmons changing pad,"I bought two of these covers in white and prewashed them both like the directions stated. They seem to have shrunk a little. Either that or they were not the right size before I washed them. They do cause the corners of the pad to smash down, but after laying my son on it, it seems to fit just fine. They are very soft and my son has fallen asleep on the changing table many times. If he likes it that is all that's important to me!"
1,Should have read reviews,"I always read reviews, but didn't think it necessary for such a minor purchase. I should have...it shrunk! Not just a little either...it's not useable."
2,Didn't really like this one,"I registered for both the Simmons changing pad and two covers for my shower. I received the pad but no covers. We purchased a cover from USA Baby (where we bought furniture) first. That cover works well, and has the slots for the safety straps. I only had the one at first, and it has been washed a lot with no shrinkage or fading (I have yellow). My mom purchased a Simmons cover from my registry (you really do need two covers!) two months ago. The color is a nicer shade of yellow (we have the Suzy's Zoo decor from Babie's R' Us), but that is the only thing I like. I washed it once before use in cold water and it was very difficult to put on the pad. I had to bend the pad to get the cover to fit. Now I have bent corners on my pad! I also hate that theree are no slots for the safety straps. One would think that since Simmons made the pad, they would make the cover to fit correctly! I have since bought another cover from USA Baby."
2,Cover is not very good,"After the first wash the chaning pad cover shrunk a little to small to fit the contoured changing pad (and still be able to lay flat) and there were a few pulls in the terrycloth. Not well made. The coutoured chaning pad is great, but they rip you off by getting you to buy a copule of the poor quality chaning pad covers for almost the price of the pad."
2,Comparatively...Not-So-Hot,"I have two of these changing pad covers and used them both for a year with my first child. They are mediocre. I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use. I stitched them back up, but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places. I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap...one is not present. Finally, I used it with the changing pad by ""Especially for Baby"" and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time.For a few more dollars, I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids' chamois pad covers. They are extrememly soft (you'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff!), have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly."
5,Holds up to lots of use.,This cover has been washed over and over and over and still looks new. You can never have too many.
1,Not Impressed,I wish that the cover had holes cut out for the safety straps on the pad. I made my own holes with a sewing machine and after the first wash I found that it shrunk and no longer fits the pad.
5,It fits fine after washing!,"Yes, it would appear that the cover does not fit properly after washing, but that's because you're not putting it on right! You have to line up the corner seams of the cover to the corners of your contoured changing pad, NOT under the changing pad, silly! And yes it shrinks a little because its cotton, (it has to be cotton to be absorbable) but it stretches right back out when you put it on correctly. It is a fine product."
5,"Great cover, fits perfectly","I just finished washing two of these covers for the first time, and put one on my changing pad. I was happy to discover that despite the negative reviews I read it fits perfectly. Due to the odd shape of the contoured pad, it did take a few moments to get into the right place.As for the softness, it feels like terry cloth and seems perfectly soft enough. And despite other reviews, it is rather thick...I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit thinner actually.I also haven't had any issue with the straps and the lack of holes, since they are attached at the bottom of the pad and fit over the cover."
3,Waste,"While the changing pad cover itself is of fine quality, I found that I stopped using it after about 2 weeks. Almost every time I changed my newborn, she would pee or spit up on it requiring it to be washed. I found it was in my washing machine more than on my changing table. It was easier just to use the bare changing pad, at least then you can just wipe off any mess with a baby wipe and it's good to go. But when I did use it, it fit nicely and the stains came out well in the wash."
2,Covers fall apart after one wash,"We were given two of these terry cloth covers from our registry. We haven't even had our baby yet, we've just washed the covers once so they're clean before we use them for the first time. They both look like they've been used for years, after only one washing. Threads have come loose, parts of both covers are now threadbare, and both covers shrunk and are difficult to put on the changing pad now. They are also rough-feeling now, not soft at all. I wouldn't recommend these."
2,Not as nice as I expected,"I bought three of these based on other reviews. I have to say I'm really disappointed. The terry cloth is very rough - not soft at all, and even though many customers said they had no problem with shrinkage, these will barely fit over the changing pad now that they've been washed. (And I didn't use hot water - just warm.) I'm giving them two stars because the colors are nice, and they'll serve the purpose."
4,Fits Snug after washing,"I received this cover as a gift, and when I first put it on the contoured pad it was slightly loose, then after washing it (warm cycle) it seemed to fit better...snug. I am happy with this product, and it's great for good quality sanitization! The price is pretty high...I would never pay that much for a towel! lol It does do a great job keeping baby's area sanitized and that is what any mother would hope for!"
1,IT DOES NOT FIT/POOR QUALITY,"I am not sure if all changing table pads are a standard size or if the pad on my changing table is abnormally large. However, this cover was too small for my changing table pad. I did wash it before I tried to use it. So, I'm not sure if it just shrunk, or if it was too small from the beginning. However, my changing table pad is now scrunched into a oval shape due to how small this cover is. I guess, I'll be on the lookout for an ""extra large"" changing table pad cover.In additon, I was not impressed with the quality of this cover, it became very ""fuzz balled"" after just the one washing."
2,don't bother,Just one more thing to wash. It seemed like a good idea so we bought two since we have twins and so we'd always have one on hand. When our girls were younger they frequently had 'accidents' on the changing pad. It's easier and quicker to wash and sterilize the vinyl changing pad than to launder the cover.
1,"Bad, bad product","I agree with the customer who wonders why there are no slits for the safety straps, since Simmons makes both products and recommends the covers on the packaging of the changing pad. The safety straps are too short when you put the cover on because it pins them to the underside of the pad and there's less strap to reach around the baby. Also, the stupid thing shrank when I washed it before using it for the first time, and then the terrycloth ripped away from the elastic when I put the cover on. So it was damaged from the outset. Don't buy this!"
3,not really needed,"This is a nice cover for the changing table pad but it is not really necessary. I find it annoying to take on and off, especially since it needs to be changed almost every day. It is also bulky in the wash. Instead I use a large hand towel that I just lay flat under my daughter. Works just as well and is much easier to change (and cheaper to buy.)"
2,Not great,"Even before it's washed, it crushes the corners of the changing pad. The fabric is also quite thin. I found it much cheaper and nicer to just buy a nice towel and make my own."
5,Perfect fit for Simmons countour changing pad.,"This is a plush, soft and durable changing pad. It fits nicely over the Simmons contour changing pad. I've washed it several times and have had no problems with shrinking or freying."
2,Falls Apart,"I bought one terry cloth cover and after one washing, the elastic came un-attached from the cover. I wrote Simmons and they sent me another one for free. This was really nice, but after two washings, the second one is falling apart as well. I have thought of having someone make me a stronger cover. The colors are pretty and the rest of our nursery furniture (all Simmons) has been wonderful."
3,It's a little too small,"Is it just me, or are these covers too small for the Simmons changing pad? I purchased two of the white ones, and they both fit so tightly that they warp the changing pads a bit."
3,positive,"Carr won a Grammy for this disc, a contemporary collection of pop ballads and up tempo numbers. The material is uneven, but Carr is always worth listening to."
2,Broke after 3 years,"These shifters are great when they work, but my rear shifter stopped indexing after only 3 years of fairly light use. They still shift in friction mode, but for the price they should last a lot longer than they did. I have thumb shifters from a 1987 mountain bike that still work great so I don't understand why these are not just as durable. I will try Microshift's bar end shifters next time."
2,Failed with no replacement parts,"I have these on my Surly LHT. When in for new cables, the tech told me that a washer (probably cost $1.50) was broken and I had to replace BOTH shifters as they are NOT sold separately and NO replacement parts are sold by Shimano. He also had the gaul to charge me $127.00 when everyone else sells them for under $100. I am fed up with Shimano and their uncaring attitude and poor quality control. A few years ago I was getting off from a stoplight and my Shimano front crank arm broke off completely! Never had that happen before and my bike shop never had either. Next time I get SRAM all the way."
1,Disappointed that description (or photo) did not show skull emblem on helmet,"I was very disappointed when I opened the box to see that this helmet (meant for children), has very visable white skull emblem on the back of it. I chose this set after much searching on the internet because it matched the scooter we had just ordered for my almost 4 year old son. Some parents may not care one way or the other about this emblem, but I find it inappropriate for a child's safety helmet. I feel the company should display a photo of the back of the helmet so parents who share my view can simply move on to another option. I have never felt the need to return anything I purchased on the internet before (or to write a ""bad"" review), but this helmet will either be returned or simply thrown away."
1,all that difficult music,"I had a hard time getting through MINOTAUR in one sitting even after educating myself with everything I could read on the Internet about the subject matter, music and composer. I would go to see any performance of LULU or WOZZECK any day of the week but MINOTAUR would be a hard sell. I simply could not get into the music. If it wasn't for the glorious singing of Christine Rice in the roll of ARIADNE I probably would have given up. I could not fault the production values especially the lighting. A feast for the eyes on this DVD. The surround sound was fantastic but I just needed more drama and a hint of a melody in the score. I'm going to put this work on the shelf for now but in a few months will try it again."
5,For those seeking answers to life's big questions.,Chuck makes our relationship with God understandable. This book is a must read for all lovers of AA and the principles it stands for.
1,I could not finish this book it was so bad.,"This guy sounds like alcohol abuse left a few screws loose after it had its way with him. Also he mentions early in the book how he lost everything but he really lost nothing. He still had his house, wife, family, and yes he still had his job even though his boss was upset. How people give this book 5 stars is beyond me and I would not recommend it to anyone especially a newcomer unless you want to scare them away from AA."
3,"great shape, took awhile to get here","Took almost 4 weeks to get Virginia from NY. When it did, it was in great shape and I was able to present my buddy with his gift. I was able to practice patience. That's all that mattered in the end ;-')"
1,I don't know about you....,I don't know about you but he still sounds like a tongue chewing babbling idiot to me.Thank you and good-night.
5,Great Read,This book is a great read for anyone that needs to look at life in a new way and be a happier person. It is very uplifting and has a lot of good suggestions on how to lead a better life.
5,worth a read,"A refreshingly honest report of a talk by a man who changed his life around from misery to happiness and, who wants to share that miracle with others. A very easy read describing a path to a living spirituality, a step by step program for life. Easy steps for alcholics, problem drinkers or unhappy, lost people searching for meaning."
4,recuerdos,"Este es un album lleno de nostalgia y de recuerdos,la mayorias de las canciones eran las favoritas de mi muy querida madre (q.e.p.d.) y otras parecian contar la historia de su vida.Se los recomiendo en especial a los romanticos empedernidos"
5,Luau Steering Wheel Cover,I am very pleased with this product. I received it within a few days after I placed my order. I am very pleased with the quality and appearance of it.
5,"Another ""Hit"" for the Captives","The story of Deerfield continues with this outstanding copulatiion of original letters written by the captives.Many of these letters have yet to be published until now.This author team brings the reader closer to the 1704 raid than ever before,as we become caught up in the emotions of the captive person. As with their first book ""Captors and Captives"" they intertwine all three cultures so we see how complex those times were.I hope this collaboration continues with more research on the subject,for it brings us closer to our New England past."
4,Excellent,"Since purchasing the record albums in the sixties I have never tired from listening to these two excellent soundtrack albums,Music From Secret Agent(Dangerman) and Music From The Saint. What a treat having both these ablums on one CD. Being an advid fan of both Saint and Secret Agent series this album is a marvelous addition to anyones collection. I believe some of the best TV soundtracks were made in the the 1960's. The only complaint I have is the fact that the albums featured on this CDare to short in duration. There must be other compositions from both programs. I find the albums music authentic to the TV programs represented. I would strongly suggest that you purchase this album. The tragedy is that these ablums are only featured for a short period of time and afterwards almost impossible to find."
4,Saint/Danger Man,"Great tunes from both shows: The Saint and Dangerman, but not the original recordings. These are all new recordings, including the latin song ""Mio Amore Sta Lontano"" resung."
5,Wordsworth and the Advanced Zin Mind,"Dr. Rudy's explanation of Wordsworth is outstanding. Wordsworth probes deep into the Taoist mind. I found Dr. Rudy's book most edifying. It has given me renewed insight into Taoism and into nature. However, I do not recommend this book for beginners of Taoism. Dr. Rudy's use of verbatim is exstinsive throughout the entire book."
3,Bell Vela Bike Helmet,I returned the helmet. A woman's universal fit does not fit a woman who has a larger than normal head. It was entirely too tight. I later found a Bell helmet with a quick fix type adjustment that fits just fine. I would have kept the one I returned if it fit as I chose it for the color and design and liked it very much.
2,not confortable,"I thought the blue would be more sapphire, a deeper blue but it is definitely more of a baby blue. I could live with that but the front side strap sat too forward. It hit around my temples verses being near my ears. I couldn't live with that. I could have attempted some adjustments but I returned the item before messing with it."
5,One of the funniest of Pym's novels; a real delight,"""Crampton Hodnet,"" a novel of Oxford, entertains and amuses in a way few books do. Miss Doggett, the upright spinster who entertains hapless Oxford youths at tea parties in her dark North Oxford home; Jessie Morrow, her companion (who reappears later in ""Jane and Prudence""); their curate lodger, the vicar and his wife, Miss Doggett's cousin, the academic Francis Cleveland, his vague but charming wife Margaret, Francis's brilliant student, Barbara Bird, and many others enrich the cast of an enchanting novel The plot is more vigorous than in some of Pym's later works, and one laughs from beginning to end. Treat yourself some rainy afternoon."
5,Think of this as the BEST one!,"Though always insightful and just stunningly human, Barbara Pym's novels do tend to blur into one another, fraught as they are, with spinsters and vicars who take tea on rainy days and wonder about what is ""suitable."" But this one stands out.Oh sure, there's a vicar and a tender young curate and a couple of spinsters and lots of tea and a few unsuitable dresses, comments, situations, and even romances; but in this, Barbara Pym's first novel, the characters are funnier, and the farce is one shade broader.Think of this as the BEST one. That will help you sort it out."
4,Fun but easy to solve,"This book is fun for kids. I tried reading the regular Sherlock Holmes book, the Hound of the Baskervilles, but it wasn't too good for me. I've read all the Harry Potter Books twice, but the Hound of the Baskervilles was too hard. I was excited when I found this book of Sherlock Holmes written for kids, and I liked it a lot. The only thing is that it was kind of easy to solve. I figured it out pretty quickly. That's why this book is a fun, but easy to solve, mystery book for kids."
4,Great intro for kids!,"I bought this for a friend of mine to introduce her and her daughter to Sherlock Holmes, my all-time favorite literary character! Though I haven't read it myself, my friend said she and her daughter absolutely loved it and couldn't wait to read more! Sounds like a success to me :)"
2,Don't Bother,Just get 512 MB or 1 GB or don't get one at all 256 MB just isn't enough. ( Assuming you're buying it for the PSP. )
5,Very Good Memory Stick,"I bought this memory stick for the psp, it works, it does its job and doesn't break. This memory stick fits in the psp and it is a much cheaper buy. You can buy the sony memory stick but it is the same thing, save some extra bucks and buy this one. 256MB is the perfect amount of space for a couple game saves and about 80 to 100 songs. Personally that is all i need. I strongly recommend this memory stick for the psp but if you are getting it for something like a camera then you should read the manual and make sure this would fit. For the psp BUY THIS MEMORY STICK! It is perfect. And you could save a few extra bucks."
5,A Great Book for Beginners,I Bought this book on an impulse at the book shop while buying some books on programming. I've never regreted that decision. Its a really good book dealing with the simple basics of microprocessors and digital electronics along with fundamentals of assembly language programming. Any one who wants to learn more about how computers work should buy this one..... I definitely rate it 5-star.
4,AN Excellent Book for learning the 8088 Microprocessor,This is a great book for beginners using the 8088 concepts for programming and interfacing.Clears most of your doubts without consulting your lecturer
4,Nice teapot,"I enjoy a pot of tea in the afternoon during the cold months, and this teapot is easy to use and easy to clean - just pop it in the dishwasher. Plain styling and white color allow it to go into any kitchen. The only improvement I'd like to see is an included basket/strainer for loose tea."
5,Can hold 44 ounces without dripping,"I got the Corelle Coordinates Enhancements Teapot about three months ago and have used it every day since.I was absolutely delighted find that, if filled to the top, the capacity is about 44 ounces. I have poured steaming hot water directly from the boiling kettle into it and the glaze remains crack free.I was a bit concerned about the kettle being manufactured in China since I usually avoid anything produced there that can be ingested or used to prepare the same. However, I decided to trust the Corelle name and hoped that the Corning company made sure that quality controls were in place.This is the perfect teapot for me since the spout seems to be higher the the top of the water level even when filled, it never leaks or drips when pouring."
3,Not Made in USA,"It's nice, it's machine washable but I wish it wasn't made in China. Product description would be more helpful if it revealed how many ounces of water it holds. Bigger than expected so I guess it's a deal."
3,Mismatched color,"Corelle Coordinates Enhancements TeapotI like the teapot and it got there on time, BUT the teapot lid color does not match the teapot!! it's a creme and the teapot is white. Found it to be too much of a hassle to return and wait for a new one, so will make do, but this is surprising from a company like Corelle."
5,MEMORIES!!,"This CD makes me think of falling in love as a teenager.I gave this as a present to my fiance, who is a ""white guy"" and I know he'll enjoy it. The songs are just great...full of emotion...and universal in theme. Made me cry to listen to it after ten years!"
4,Herman is back in action,I was happy to see richard hermans new novel bring back Matt. He does a excelent job bringing diffrent charcters from past books and melting them into new ones. I would advise anyone to read this book.
3,Herman loses his edge....,"Richard Herman is one of my favorite authors...his first several books were page turners...but as he has gone deeper into the Potonski family...he has started to lose his edge...and this book read like it was written in a hurry. It jumps around...has incomplete characters...predictable sub-plots...yet it was still worth reading...but I suggest you borrow it from someone who shelled out the cash...or wait for paperback. Hopefully he will take a deep breath before he starts the next one, which the ending of the book clearly portends."
3,"So So ""Thriller""","Well, it could have been a great story, but it still was okay. The characters are a bit two dimensional and, in some ways, unrealistic. You have to make some great leaps in logic to follow the storyline, but once you do, the rest falls into line. Not a bad rainy day read, but not the best either."
3,OK watch,The numbers for the date are realy small. The crown (time adjuster) sticks out too much. Keeps getting caught on everything.
4,Classic 80's horror,I remember seeing this as a 10 year old and thinking it was the coolest thing ever. Of course with all the advances in movie making this one comes off a bit cheesy now.... but it's still a great movie! If your a fan of monster movies or just love B-rate horror... you can't lose.
3,alligator,"My Son loved this movie.....of course, you have to like movies of this type, and he does. He has watched it over and over again already.As always, Amazon had our order here very fast......we are pleased!!"
1,Alligator Movie from DVD Legacy,I was not pleased with movie store. They never sent my movie or replied back when i sent them messages. Amazon returned my money though. I wont order from them again.
3,"Review of ""Alligator""","If you're looking for an old fashioned, hokey horror classic, this movie is definitely it! It is a throwback to tales based upon urban legend (hence, the alligator that gets flushed down the toilet, lives for years in the sewer, then finally breaks free and wreaks havoc storyline). However, since it is based on urban legend, it is still fun to watch the film and imagine ""what if..."""
4,Hey Croc,"Plenty of action from the word go, Don't play around the sewers as you never know whats waiting for you. The story line was good and I enjoy the movie very much. Plenty of suspense as well keeps you sitting there to see what happens next."
5,greattttttttttttttt,a masterpiece a clasic critics and fans alike loved the movie the then in 1980 original story about a baby alligator flushed down the toilet and grows hugwe thats the concept for almost crocodile sory alligator the best out of all of them this gory suspensful and even a little scary farce is entertaining while scarieng you
5,The only GREAT alligator movie.,"Sure, this movie is as old as I am and F/X are pretty outdated. So what! Alligator is awesome. The use of real alligators was smart thinking. The fake alligator does not look all that bad, but you can still tell it's fake. The gore in this movie is done pretty well, you get to see a man get eaten whole body and all, body parts, lots of blood, the alligator crashes a wedding and goes on a bloody rampage. Skip Lake Placid if you want to see a good alligator horror movie. This is the one."
5,alligator,"This is a very good movie that I saw.It has gore,creature violence,action,terror,an explosion.And the mostimportant thing a kinda happy ending.So domore good reviews for this movie ok."
5,An Extraordinary Journey Into Childhood,"Inside Out is such a compelling combination of real life and wonder. Clearly, Ms. Lipper would make an extraordinary therapist. That those children shared their inner lives with such trust and such a lack of self-consciousness is a testament to the connection she made with them. I was extremely touched by the film. I loved that the filmmaker included so many different children, from different worlds - I cried and smiled and all the while felt privileged to have been invited into that very unique universe."
3,Useful Guide but...!,"This is a very useful guide for those looking for bargain fares. The book provides a comprehensive look on the available discount fares and provides tips and guidance to those who may wish to benefit from the bargains.However, a lot has happened since the book was written. There is growth in low cost airlines in most parts of the world. These offer some very low fares which are affordable to those seeking budget fares. In addition, there are several websites that provides the reader with very low fares. Rather than list them here, one can just go to Google or Yahoo and other websites and carry out the search. That is why it is not absolutely necessary to buy this book."
2,Desperately Needs Updated Revision,"I'm sure this was a brilliant book in 1998-2000. Even by 2012 standards, it is extremely well researched and written. The biggest problem I see with it is that it is about 90% irrelevant today. If you read even a few pages into it, you will see what I mean. Many of the links are no longer active. Additionally, the primary money-saving technique mentioned, the air courier ticket, seems to no longer be a valid technique. It appears that almost airlines have eliminated this opportunity or have redefined it to levels that make it no longer applicable. With all that said, I would very much like to see a modern post 9/11 revision. Any book like this needs constant updating and revision to keep up with the rapidly evolving internet customer base. I just wonder why this was not done. I can only assume that there is a good reason."
2,"This book wasn't for me, but there is useful information in it.","I found a lot of the points to be repetitive, which I understand if you want to reiterate the point. For me it just wasn't a good fit. Although, I agree with the author that women also struggle with the sexual battles just as men, the book didn't approach my needs or concerns. Nonetheless, I did gain valuable insight, but overall the book was just okay.I would suggest reading the look inside excerpt. If you like what you read, then buy it. If not, then skip it, because its not going to get any better."
5,Changed My Life,"This book was recommended to me at a marriage retreat. I learned so much by reading this book and it has completely changed the way that I look at everyday life experiences and even my marriage. I would recommend this book to every woman, married or not, to learn how to be women of emotional integrity, establish a closer relationship with God, and live a more satisfying life (particularly in marriage). Awesome book....I plan on sharing it with anyone I can!"
2,Every Woman's Battle,"Bought this on the recommendation of an aquaitence. Was not impressed with it, I only skimmed it after reading the first few pages. If I was struggling with these issues, it might be a good reference. I was not exactly sure what the book was about, but the person recommending it raved about how it changed their life. I think it just wasn't something I needed."
2,"some parts helpful, others not","The book is designed for women who are married, engaged, or planning on marrying someday. I found the information about forgiveness and the chapter on guarding your heart especially useful. Some other parts weren't."
5,Good,I bought both the every man's battle and every women battle. It was a very touching book. I am keeping this book so that I can give to my daughter when she is ready fo rthe marriage.
1,Women have lust issues too!,"I don't know how this book can help a woman in REAL LIFE.A woman is just as likely to be turned on visually by anyonethey find attractive including a stranger.Maybe evangelicalshave a hard time believing a woman is human as a man is,and notsome angel up on a pedestal.The sexual tendencies in a woman are just as strong as a man's.Women have been so sexuallyoppressed that it might seem shocking to many women to think ofthemselves as a sexual being.The focus in the book is more onthe man lusting and the woman responding to the lust.All theold sterotypes are presented in this book.I'm not surprizedsince Christians now a days are obessed with ""differences""they hope are there so they can keep oppressing women and boxingthem into a narrow area of abilities and personality traits."
2,Helpful to the faithful.....,"I ordered this book on a recommendation of a dear and true friend who serves upon the ship M V Odulus, which sails throughout the world preaching it's Christian religion and bringing books and knowledge to those in deprived places on this earth. I highly recommend the book for anyone who is truly faithful and believing in Jesus Christ...it would definately be helpful from a religious aspect. But for those of us who are atheists, or only believing of a ""higher power"" or ""energies"", this book will leave you befuddled and chuckling ever so lightly. I think the book is truthful in regards to it's direct religious aspects, but personally, leaves the rest of us shaking our heads in religious discomfort."
3,Too short,"While the book is of great value itself, it is too short. Only parts of the original Sun-Tzu's Art Of War were tranlasted here, leaving you hunger for more."
3,Def Disappointment,"At last the wait is over, 112's new single is out and it does not live up to expectations. Their first single under the wings of Def Jam isn't that bad, but its nothing compared to what this quartet are capable of. However the original remix isn't even on this single, its some remix with loads of reggae on, I was really let down with this, but I hoped that the 2nd song would save them. It doesn't, Slim, Daron Q and Mike are all struggling for lyrics when they get 1:30 into the song. So all Im saying is, I cant wait for Jagged Edges new album, Ive heard their single and its hot."
3,Should Of Stayed On Bad Boy,"I guess this is supposed to make 112 more known (COMMERCIAL) by displaying them with a more ""hip-hop/reggae"" sound but this isn't 112, at least not the 112 fans know. Puff knew what he was doing by keeping them R&B cause that's what suits them. ""Na Na Na"" is alright, it'll help them sell records but this is NOT 112 at all."
1,what the hell is this??,"I was a big fan of 112 till'they launched the (Part III) because it is 2 commercial and the album has 3 good songs, and 1 or 2 listenable, and i thought that it was only a bad period of 112, but after i heard they new songs i think that 112 is a piece of sh*t and i dont give a damn the other revierwers who say that 112 is still good, because they can't admit that 112 only has respect but not talent,but if you want to waste your money, go and pick this piece of garbage.So i can say that i wont buy this sh*t, because i prefer to pick the new JE's album, and i'm sure that is a lot better"
3,Woo-hoo! A movie with Jasmine Guy!,"I have always been a big fan of Jasmine Guy. I wish she had more leading roles in movies since her TV days back in the 80's.I bought this DVD and was pleasantly surprised. If you are a guy who likes Jasmine Guy, you'll probably enjoy this movie. I even bought a spare copy of this DVD."
2,Klash Review,"I wonder why they did not get a real Jamaican to play the lead Jamaican role. The fake accents just do not cut it. Otherwise, a fairly decent movie."
1,none,how can i review something i paid for and never got so when i get ill review it how about sending it to me so i can look at it i have
2,NOT WORTH IT,THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH THE $10 SAVE YOUR MONEY. JASMINE GUY TRIES BUT HER JAMAICAN ACCENT IS HORRIBLE
1,Avoid this rug!,The appearance of this rug barely resembles that of the picture. It is much uglier in person. I ended up returning it after a couple of weeks of very light use. You could run your hand across the top of the rug and have a handful of fabric. Complete junk.
1,Potty Mouth Phrases,"I thought this would be a great way for my 10 year old and me to learn a few phrases before our trip to Italy. This would have been fine if I was 20 years younger and traveling with a bunch of free loving hippies. Using this book, I can use pick up someone up at a bar, ask for a condom, let everyone know I brought my own needle and call people derogatory names. Sure, I can learn to order spaghetti for dinner, but this is definitely not what I was expecting. In the future, I will have to read over a phrase book in person before purchasing."
1,Worthless....,"Hi,Don't waste your money. It didn't cool my car, it didn't work half the time, etc etc. What a disappointment. I returned it for $ back. Not worth it...sad to say. Thanks, Tina"
1,Better conversation starter than function,"I am skeptical about all these gadgets shown on TV, but this one was priced where it just seemed worth trying out. I do think it creates more conversation than cooling.The weakness of this unit? The unit has to be pointed directly at the sun. I figured if the sun was within about 45 degrees from either side of direct sunlight, the unit would power up the fan, but it does not.What I found works better for me is leaving the windows down just a quarter inch and having a side window vent on the vehicle. Side Window vents are perfect for protecting the vehicle from an unexpected shower while parked and also conceal that your windows are slightly opened. They also reduce road noise when the windows are closed, but you can also vent your car while driving when it is raining out too.Lastly, it doesn't slice and dice. Okay, not all TV gadgets slice and dice.Pretty neat idea, just needs more solar panels that are directed in more directions."
1,False Advertisement,"I am one of the idiots that believed the hype so I ordered one of these vents. First of all the fan housing will not stay shut and on top of that, the fan itself slides on it's spindle until it makes contact with the housing then stops (little tape on the spindle fixed this problem). I have a ext. cab truck so I figured that I had less interior to cool down so this vent should work fine. Boy was I wrong! You can get the same effect by leaving your windows cracked. Just a fair warning that you will fill silly buying this piece of junk but if you must, make sure it faces direct sunlight or you won't get to see the little novelty fan (that doesn't move air) turn.Bottom line, save your money or I will sell you mine for $.25 if you pay S&H...;."
1,Not worth hoot,"I bought 2 of these (a fool and his money are soon parted). I looked through all of the different vendors, thinking that there are real differences in the fan sold by each. There really is none. (Not even the ""original"" auto vent). The solar panel needs to be in direct sunlight - won't do much good in a partly cloudy sky or in the morning sunlight. When there is enough light to make the fan spin, the fan doesn't really generate enough power to move air. I held a strand of hair directly in front of the exhaust side of the vent - the hair hardly moved though the fan was moving. Do not waste your money. I wonder whether the favorable reviews are written by people who have a vested interest in sales of this useless product, or by people who are fooled by a ""placebo effect."" Sounds like a class action suit in the making. I can't believe Amazon.com allows products like these to be featured in its website."
2,Not for cars with tinted windows.,Although the fan does work.. It DOES NOT work with tinted window and here in Florida (where this item would be a life saver) there aren't many cars untinted.
1,Does NOT Work,"When I could actually get the fan to spin on this item, it was still ineffectual. I noticed NO difference in the temperature of my sitting vehicle between the periods using and not using the fan. Perhaps with a windshield sun screen the fan could be more effective, but it seems to me that this item should be able to be used in PLACE of a sun screen. BUYER BEWARE: My experience with this item has been a terrible one and I would NOT recommend it to others."
1,Don't buy Auto Vent Car Ventilator,"Don't buy this product if you live in a city in which tinted windows are necessary.This product comes witn instructions that tell you not to use it with tinted windows. I tried it anyway. If the heat of the day sun in Phoenix is not sufficient to power this fan, it is of limited value. It simply did not work with a factory tinted window.The instructions also say there will be no refunds. If defective, it will be replaced.If you decide to order it just for fun, use a credit card so you can get your money back.I should have known better than to order something so inexpensive. You do get what you pay for."
4,Dodge pickup cold air intake,"My OEM plastic housing broke so I purchased this item to replace. The instructions were good enough to not have any trouble with installation. All parts needed came with the kit. The kit was fairly easy to install. It helps to have 2 people to install the plastic intake to the motor. It took me about an hour to install. I have not noticed any gas mileage increase. Normal driving there is not any difference but step on the gas and the sound is wonderful, throttle response and performance is better. I would purchase the same kit again. I did not have to drill any holes, everything bolted up just fine with no issues."
5,Dewalt grinder,"Bought a cheap grinder from that popular discount tool store ,used it for about a hour then it quit, So I said its time to buy a good grinder so I did ,no regrets. Dont waste your money on the cheap ones , buy a good one ,this Dewalt is a very good grinder. Would buy agian."
1,Poorly made product,"The worse hair dryer I have ever used. The heat setting is either too ""HOT"" or LUKEWARM. No way to tilt the bonnet so that you can dry the lower back part of your head, and it is extremely difficult to open the dryer and to lower the bonnet. I suggest that anyone considering purchasing this product, ask to see it demonstrated BEFORE you make your purchase. This is a very poorly made product and not worth the price. I bought it because of an emergency while I was away from my home; however, I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Book not a total wash,This book has some unique ideas. Some are very easy to pull off while some seem very unique to the ministries where they oriinally happened. The book may inspire you to create more memorable moments with your youth. It is worth having for the few new ideas that it can give you. This is definitely not Doug Fields best work but is worth the purchase.
3,"Comprehensive, but nothing insightful if you're experienced","Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I didn't find this book valuable for an experienced M&A; professional, particularly if you're working with the caliber of legal counsel that you probably should employ for a transaction.On the other hand, if you're new to M&A;, I believe it would prove well worth the price, as it offers a comprehensive overview of many facets of due diligence as well as several checklists and forms."
1,Poor product,The product is of poor quality and does not work well. You hear a lot of static that can not hear the baby well. I do not recommend buying it.
3,Good under the right circumstances,"The best part of this monitor is the price. You really can't beat it. You can tell in the quality of the construction. They're very light cheap plastic. But I don't think that really matters as long as it works. I had originally bought one and it worked very well. It was crystal clear so I was impressed for the money I had spent. I then made the mistake of buying a second monitor for my second child's room when my old monitor conked out. Unfortunately even putting each one on separate channels (there are 2 to pick from) the reception became terrible. I could hear each bedroom from each monitor along with screeching static. I ended up having to shelve the second monitor and get a more expensive unit. If you only need one it will probably work great for you. However if you need two, save your money and get a better unit with more channels."
2,No battery backup for Baby Unit,"I can't comment on how clear the monitor might be or any level of interference. When I saw that it wasn't as advertised I packed it up to return without even plugging it in. I bought directly from Amazon, but received a different model from what is pictured (not sure if it is an older or newer model, the instructions were printed in 2009 and the packaging was different than what is pictured on Amazon and other websites).Here is where Amazon's description differs from the product I received. The online description (as of 8/1/2011) mentions ""can also be used with TWO 9-volt batteries"" and ""low battery indicators LIGHTS"". I took this to mean that both the baby monitor and the parent handset were capable of being plugged in with battery backup. They are not, only the parent handset is capable of battery backup. If the power goes out, the monitor just stops working."
2,Horrible buzzing sound,"We bought this for our toddler, hoping to have a simple monitor that we could use to know when she was awake after nap and in the morning. Unfortunately, the parents' unit buzzes so loudly that it was almost impossible to hear anything that was going on in the room. The monitor has two channels, and the buzzing was the same on both channels. To keep the buzzing at a reasonable level, I had to turn the volume down so much that I couldn't hear anything happening in her room, even with the monitor at my ear. We returned this and are going to be looking for a better quality monitor."
2,This is not crystal clear,"This monitor is loud! It gets the job done, but there's a lot of white noise that comes off this thing."
2,Too much statics...,"You get what you pay for... For $17 you should not expect a lot. It does its job, but with quite some statics in the background. It's working OK for me, but I regret not spending some more for a better quality monitor."
2,No Peace of mind,"The monitor is not clear, I heard all backgrounds sounds but not my daughter, unless she was high pitched crying..Cannot rest easy at night, bought new item."
1,Static or other people,"This monitor is awful. Do not waste your money. It certainly isn't ""crystal clear."" I can't hear my son in the next room. Often times I will wake up to another family waking up. How awkward."
2,"""Crystal Clear"" is whose opinion?!",This Monitor gets BAD interference! Very buzzy with static! I would not recommend it. I gave it 2 stars because it's super affordable ... but you don't want to buy it unless you really don't mind the interference and constant buzz.
4,Surprisingly nice!,"We got this monitor because...well, because it was free with a coupon (for spending $75 on other items). Surprisingly, it performs extremely well. It does not filter out ambient noise like higher end models do, but then again, some people like to hear EVERYTHING. Clarity is perfectly OK and range is sufficient for most homes.We are keeping it as out travel monitor since it is small enough to fit into a travel bag and works well in most environments. Very happy with the purchase."
1,Have not liked this monitor from day one,"The reciever won't stand up, it falls over easily, so you have to lay it on it's side. I'm continually having to play with the on switch to get the static to stop. It is hard to determine the volume because there are no clear marks on the dial. Even after you get everything set the clarity is weak. Spend a few extra dollars and get something better."
2,I want a different one!,"I received this monitor as a gift, so it was basically free. I HATE it though, it eats through batteries like crazy. I have to change it every three to four days, and we really don't use the battery option much. It stays plugged in all night long. It's full of static and the volume control is difficult to manipulate. I like to have it turned down really low so I can only hear my two month old wake up, I don't want to hear his snoring or breathing all night long. But there is no in between setting, it's either turned up all the way, or down too low to hear crying. It is flimsy and difficult to get the receiver to stand alone (it tends to fall over).I want to spend the money and purchase a better unit, that's why I'm browsing the internet for monitors right now."
2,Annoying radio signals!,"This monitor is super sensitive and does pick up even the smallest sounds in our daughter's room, but the receiver also picks up a radio station. It is very annoying, particularly at night, so we are going to try another brand."
5,Great for the price.,It works perfect for us plugged into the walls (haven't tried wireless). We don't have neighbors nearby so there are no interference issues. Sound quality is good with the volumn at medium.
4,Better than expected,"We did not have much expectations about the product while we were ordering. We are surprised and impressed by the functionality and quality of the product with respect to the amount we spend buying it. Its a value buy, worth the money."
4,"Easy to use, sensitive, may buzz a little","I'm very impressed by the audio on this unit. You can really hear the smallest noise, even a clock ticking in a different room than the transmitter!I also bought this unit because both the transmitter and receiver can be AC powered or battery powered, so it's versatile as to where you can use it.The only downside is if you try to sleep with this on, the audio tends to get buzzy sometimes, some sort of interference. Moving or reorienting the receiver seems to help, but it's a pain to have to fiddle with it. Seems like with some digital signal processing or digital tuning that could be eliminated, but then again this is not an expensive unit so I don't expect miracles."
4,Great set for Grandma's house,"These monitors work well for the price point. We wanted a spare set of monitors for Grandma to have when she's babysitting. We've had no issues with them. I wouldn't choose them for a primary set of monitors, but they're fine for what we purchased them for."
2,it worked for a while,"It worked for several months, but the power plug got loose, and doesn't work any more. The price is good compare with other monitors, but I expect it to last longer...."
1,DON'T BUY!!!!,"FIRST OFF there are no pros to this monitor. It is the worse monitor out there. All you can hear is complete static, no mater the distance. My 3 year old always plays when she should be sleeping, she has even picked this monitor up and played with it but still I couldn't hear anything else besides static. I am NEVER able to hear either child of mine make any kind of sound EVEN if it's right next to their bed. I would rather use this as target practice that ever depend on it for anything."
2,Good BUT !!!!!,It worked pretty godd until the reciver fell a short distance to the rug floor and stop working clear reception !Junked it. Never buy again. Bought a better one for $10 more !!
4,Great for the Price,"This is probably one of the least costly monitors on the market. Why only 4 stars? Even for the price, I thought there were a lack of features. For a few bucks more, you can get one with lights the flash when your baby is crying."
2,Not Recommended,"I received the crystal clear monitor as a gift and it worked well for about a month and now we nothing but interferance and static.Also the 9 volt battery for the partents end of the monitor dies within a few hours,so now I have to go buy one with more megahertz; any sugestions."
4,Great monitor,"We bought this monitor so we could hear Skype calling. Because our computer is in a room off the main part of the house, we can't hear if Skype rings. We put the receiver where we are going to be and can hear now when people are calling! Works like a charm....the unit is not expesive but all we needed."
1,Terrible!,"We thought this monitor was great at first. A month later we were having trouble with the receiver. It would get so much static that you couldn't stand it. You would have to literally squeeze the receiver to keep it from giving you static, and nothing else. Then, finally, the cord to the receiver stopped working. We were going through basically a battery every two nights. We still haven't found anything to replace it. Luckily our son's room is directly across from ours, so we just leave his door open now. We bought a replacement of the same type when it first started acting up, thinking that it was just the one we had. The replacement didn't work at all. So, we'll be searching for a new one in a different brand."
1,"high on static, low on durability","Save your money and don't buy this monitor. When we lived in our apartment, the static drove us crazy! Now that we are in our house, the static is much better but the monitor only functions when it feels like it. We've owned it for 9 months and it simply doesn't work well anymore. You have to jiggle the plug part on the transmitter just right for it to transmit. You have to play with the volume control on the receiver to get it to pick up anything at all. Although, until we had these problems, I was happy with its sensitivity (I could hear my son breathing) and its range (I could be out in the yard with it). I'm very disappointed and am online looking for a new monitor."
1,The STATIC Nursery Monitor,"You can barely hear your baby with all the static, I've tried various areas for a ""clearer"" sound and it has never been clear, as a matter of fact it seems to be getting worse. My baby is now almost 4 months old and I've had to give up on this monitor - looking for a new one."
1,It broke for no reason after a month,"We loved this monitor for the first month we used it. Then, for no apparent reason, it stopped working. Getting through to the customer service phone number was incredibly difficult and they never responded to my customer service inquiry on their Web-site. I'm still trying to get them to honor their warranty - I've been trying for over two months now.It does go through batteries quickly, but you can also just plug it into a wall outlet."
1,"Static, static and more static",We received this monitor for free and I can see why...it's worthless. All we can hear from this thing is static. Too bad I can't rate this thing less than 1 star.
5,Great Monitor!,"We did a lot of reviewing for monitors. We ended up choosing this one mainly because of all the positive reviews, and it has done it's job really well. Everything has been clear on the receivers with only very infrequent interference on the channels. Plus you get two receivers with this model! If you are looking for a good product that works well for a decent price - this will work for you. Trust me - you do not need a video monitor unless you have a massive house where your baby is in an entirely different wing!"
1,This company makes faulty monitors,"I purchased two of these monitors. One works well. The other stopped working within a few hours: the transmitter just wouldn't turn on. The receiver does nothing to indicate its no longer getting a signal, which I think is a problem. This is the third monitor in three months by Safety First that I've had to return. (The other two were different models.) And their warranty policy says you have to pay shipping if you return it-even when the problem was there from the time you opened the package. I recommend you choose a different company."
3,"Lots of static, but it works.","It isn't the greatest monitor ever made, but it works. In my home which has lots of wireless gizmos it has really bad static. You can't turn it up very loud or the static is deafening. But I can normally still hear the baby cry with it down as low as I need it."
3,"Tinny sound, but it works fine","I bought this to replace my old monitor. This one has a ""tinny"" sound, but it works fine. I can hear everything happening on the 3rd floor in the kids' room--even the pitter-patter of the cat's paws. There's no interference from the neighbor's, and I live in a townhouse. This monitor was about 1/2 the price of any other one I could find, and I was definitely looking for something inexpensive. So, if you are on a tight budget, this is a good option. If you are looking for a super crystal-clear and quiet machine, this isn't for you."
1,terrible static. terrible product.,"2 choices with this monitor1) turn up volume so room filled with static noise, but you can hear baby when it crys2) turn down volume so not such loud static, but can not hear baby.terrible. returning immediately."
1,Factory assembled before the glue on the microphone dried out,"The unit, as received, was barely able to pick up sound. I opened the transmitter unit and found that the transmitter unit had been assembled before the glue that holds the microphone in place had dried. The microphone had slipped out of its mounting hole and was glued in sideways. I glued the microphone into the mounting hole facing forward in the mounting hole, and now it works right.Be sure you unplug the transmitter before you take it apart to fix it."
1,Terrible Static - worthless monitor,"We got this monitor as a gift from our baby registry. We wanted a simple monitor without bells and whistles - just good clear sound. When the monitor works, the clarity is good, but we constantly lose reception with the base and get static. Sometimes we can't get it to work at all. We contacted the Safety 1st adn they blew us off. Save your time and money - buy a different monitor."
4,great value for the price,I bought this specifically because it DID NOT have the sound and lights feature. It actually makes a lot less fussy noise than my $65 fancy monitor and the sound quality is just as good.
5,Fabulous!,"I got this moniter for free after purchasing a playyard from Babies R Us.. I had my reservations (it was free??), and read several bad reviews, but when my son came home and I set it up, I was impressed!I've had absolutely no problems with static and I can go anywhere in my home or yard and can still clearly hear my baby breathing and the quiet television in the background.I was thrilled that it turned out great... and it was free!"
1,Nothing but static,"We tried this out, hoping that it wasn't too good to be true for the price. Sadly, it was too good to be true. Nothing but static from both channels. I could hear something very faintly, but it was no match for the static. We're going to try and spend a little more for something that actually works."
2,Doubles as a ghost detector,"I used this monitor for about six months. It functions well for the price, has a decent range, and even survived a few drops. I am replacing it today because the roar of static it produces is slowly driving me insane. You will be able to hear your child over the static, but you might go crazy listening for your grandmother's voice from beyond the grave. When I'm walking around using the belt clip I feel like I'm playing silent hill. Spend a few dollars on something better."
1,"Cheap, wouldnt recommend","I bought this for us to be able to hear my daughter when we went outside for a smoke break. It worked at first, but when we moved her to her own room it stopped working. Not going to buy this monitor again."
2,poor product,"it does its job, but it looks cheap and poor finish , has a lot of noise and any electrical device can interfere with it"
4,Best Value for $,"We have gone thru 3 monitors over the past 2 years and I didn't want spend very much on another one so we got this. So far it has worked perfectly (bought it 6 months ago), nothing fancy about it but it gets the job done just as well as the pricy ones."
4,GREAT MONITOR @ Great price,"I Love this monitor. Even though it's not THE GREATEST, it works great for being under $20."
1,Static,"The monitor started out okay, but after about a month it began having so much static that it was difficult to hear the baby over the noise. Also, it is so frustrating to have to listen to all of the noise coming from the monitor (despite having very few electrical appliances and no new appliances to cause interference) that we are tempted not to use it at all. After 3-1/2 months of light to moderate use, it is so useless that we are now in the market for a new monitor."
2,Too much interference!,We got this as a shower gift for our son. We can hear him but there is so much interference that I need to turn it up to a pretty loud volume and the interference would keep me up at night! We are definitely buying a different monitor for our next child!
1,"If you want a good montior, this isn't it...","Based on the reviews I read (after the fact...Murphy's Law), I can see that after ten years, Safety 1st STILL hasn't gotten this cheapo right on a regular basis. MAJOR static problems! This is WORTHLESS, but I didn't find that out until I couldn't return it. Pay more and get something that works well or risk getting something barely usable...and GREATLY annoying."
1,Not good if you like to sleep,"We bought two of these monitors, one for each child's room since our bedroom is just a floor below their rooms. My husband said it sounded like Chewbacca was in our room. Halfway through the night I ended up going upstairs and sleeping on the floor of my 3 month old's room because neither my husband nor I was getting any sleep and I didn't want to have to wake up my baby and move him. We returned both and bought the digital monitor by safety first. The digital moniter is twice the price but works amazing!!! No background noise at all. We can even hear the crickets on the digital monitor from our son's open bedroom window it is so clear. Don't waste your time on this one, spend the money and get the digital version!"
1,lots of static,"This monitor does pick up sound in the baby's room well. However, it has so much background static noise that I could never use it when sleeping as it would keep me awake due to the constant 'hum' of the parent unit. I bought it due to the great review on this website and was very disappointed. If you want something to use when you as a parent are awake and don't care about the constant hum/static going on the whole time this is a good cheap monitor that lets you hear baby. If you want something with no background static or hum for use when you are sleeping, but want to hear baby when he cries this is NOT the monitor for you. We ended up buying theGraco iMonitor Vibe Baby Monitorand are very happy with it."
2,Get what you paid for,"We looked for the cheapest monitor we could find and this was it. It does work but you get what you pay for. The monitor has a loud buzzing background sound if any electronic equipment is nearby...or if you have lights with dimmers on nearby. Because there are no noise level lights, you cannnot turn the volume down and watch for baby activity via light levels. If you are looking for a cheap monitor for short term use than it is a good buy but this is not a long term monitor."
2,stopped working,it mysteriously didn't work one night and my baby was screaming for a long time without me knowing it :(. We tested it again and couldn't find anything wrong with it...now we are looking for a better monitor ourselves.
3,Good Monitor,I received this as a gift although I didn't register for it nor thought at the time I needed one since we live in a single level home. But it turned out to be pretty good. I rarely get any static. But there is the occasional chopping like sound.
1,"Terrible monitor-Static, Static, Static!!!","We received this monitor for free and I can honestly say you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money on this monitor. It worked well for a couple of months but then all we got was static. We couldn't hear the baby over the static. Everything interferes with this monitor-phones, tv's, radios,- even when they are turned off!! In addition, we had to replace the 9 volt battery in the monitor every other day unless we had it plugged into the wall adaptor. We spent more on the batteries than what the monitor was worth! Tomorrow we are going to buy a new monitor!"
2,no good,"I owned one of these 5 years ago and it worked reasonably well, so got another one this time around (previous one was given to my SIL). I don't know what they've changed, but this one is bad enough I'm going to break down and order something else. We've had trouble finding an outlet we can use that doesn't have other major interference (like if the alarm clock or toaster is on the same circuit). Plus, for some reason we're picking up another kid and their family that is no where around us (no babies within 2 houses in any direction). I can't imagine what they've heard us say based on what we've heard! Going to replace it with the V-tech which is less than twice as much...wish I'd put the money into that to begin with."
1,Terrible Static!!,"This has terrible static feedback no matter the channel i hate it but it will have to do till i can spend a bit more on a new one, what a piece of junk."
1,Received box and item used and scratched!,Do not buy item. I wanted to give this to someone as a gift and the box was torn and item scratched.
1,Not Satisfied,"I read the reviews that these monitors had great range, but mine do not. They have too much static sound and the range is not great at all."
1,NOT FOR USE IN APTS,"We recieved this monitor as a gift and although it may work great for some, we have 3 other apts. right next to ours with baby monitors and the monitor kept picking up their signals insted of our own- even after changing the channel. We have since bought another monitor and it seems to work great. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
2,Pain and noisy,"Just like so many others we got this free with a $75 purchase at Toys R Us. I don't think it is very clear or has a great range. Like someone else said, ""You can hear the baby breathe but there is also a static sound like air rushing through. If you can sleep with ""white noise,"" you may be OK but it drives me nuts.""Our other monitor has a rechargable battery which is SO much nicer! It means you can actually walk around with the monitor. This monitor eat batteries so who cares if it has a belt clip. We only use it plugged in (mostly when we travel to a friends house for the weekend so we can keep the good monitor set up at home!)"
2,"Poor workmanship, quality","This monitor worked fine for us, for a couple of months. But after awhile, the plug on the receiver started cracking and coming apart. When we would try to pull it out of our outlets, the plastic would seperate, exposing the wiring inside. The wires themselves were thin and seemed flimsy. We had to buy a new monitor this week to replace this one (our son is only 8 months old)."
3,Not the Greatest,"We got this free with a $75 purchase at Toys R Us so we took our original choice off of our registry. Maybe we just got a bad one because the other reviews seem to be favorable. Unlike the others, I didn't think it was that clear. Yes, you can hear the baby breathe but there is also a static sound like air rushing through. If you can sleep with ""white noise,"" you may be OK but it drives me nuts. Also, our batteries have lasted an average of 3 - 5 days. After going through 6 of them, we started using the plug full time. This is a hassle because you have to unplug and replug it every time you change rooms. I don't have any other monitors to compare it to but I don't think it's so great."
2,Not good,"I run an inhome daycare and have two of these monitors. I have them both plugged in in the kitchen but have them across the room from each other because of interference. The sounds still bleeds into each other so if one kid is making noise in one room, I can hear it in both monitors. Drives me crazy, making it hard to know which kid is awake. I bought these because of the low price and apparently, the quality reflects the cost. I will be splurging on higher quality monitors from now on."
5,I'm impressed,"I purchased this monitor to replace a more expensive one that we lost in a house fire. I am very impressed with it considering the price. It is quiet and I can hear more in this one than I could the more expensive one. I have it sitting up on a high dresser, my daughters bed is at least 10 foot away if not more and I can actually hear her breathing loud and clear."
4,Even better than the expensive models!,"We got this monitor free with a stroller purchase. Since we'd also received an expensive 900 Mhz monitor as a gift, we threw this one in the drawer, figuring we'd only use it at Grandma's or as a backup. Our expensive monitor was trash. After fighting with it for months, I pulled this one out of the drawer. It works perfectly! The sound is clear (I can even hear my son breathing as he sleeps), the range is good, and the batteries last well. I wish we'd just stuck with this one in the first place! The only thing I miss are the lights on my expensive monitor, which allowed me to turn the sound down but still see if my child was making any noise. Other than that, I love this monitor!"
4,Fine monitor,"The reception is clear, both units can be operated on batteries or plugged in. They are very portable, especially with parent unit having the belt clip. If you turn the sound all the way up you can hear your baby breathing. To hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the room you can keep the sound at the regular level.I sometimes ""walk"" the baby by putting him on the balkony in his stroller and setting the baby's unit in it, so I do not have to keep the window/balkony door open.Other features I'd look for in a monitor (that's where my rating lost a star) would be cool looks and charge base, but then again, in this one you can simply change a battery, whereas in a rechargeable unit you'd have to place it in base and loose portability for a while. Why not simply use rechargeable batteries? :)Overall it's a very good monitor and I am satisfied with it."
4,Cat monitor?,"I have a small cat tent on my veranda, and my Princess likes to be outside. However, she is very vocal when she wants to come inside, and I have to basically sit nearby to get her in. So I purchased this.I tried it out today, and it worked perfectly! It is very sensitive to sounds, I could hear birds tweeting, children talking, and I heard the meow clear as if she was next to me. For me, that made it totally worth it.However, there is white noise. A lot. It can be annoying if you wanted to sleep with it, but if you don't mind it while working or whatnot, then this is a great purchase. I would also recommend turning off the parent device first, as it makes a LOT of noise if the kids device is off.All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase."
1,Waste of Money,This didnt even work. Tried everything wouldnt work. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,You get what you pay for!,"At first the monitor seemed to do well enough for the price but I can't take the random buzzing any more! If I plug my nook into the outlet nearby or walk by the receiver it buzzes wildly. If the cat walks by the baby's crib it buzzes . We are awakened in the middle of the night by random buzzing. My sleep is worth spending extra money on a better unit, especially with baby number 2 on the way!"
3,Decent but not great,This monitor gets the job done (most of the time) but it is VERY sensitive. We had a cell phone plugged in the next room over and it went crazy with static! Flipping certain lights on and off in the house will cause it to make a sound. We tried to use batteries vs plugging it in but it ate right through them in one night! We have a small house so we won't be upgrading anytime soon. I know the static/interference is a problem with many baby monitors but it is still annoying!
2,Lots of Static/Power Adapter Broke,"Not too happy with this monitor. We thought about replacing it early on but it was ok enough to just deal with the static. My husband became the master of turning it down just enough to tolerate the sounds but hear the baby when he cried. We used it for 7 months, every day during naps and night, and today the power adapter quit working so the only way to use it is with the 9v battery which lasts all of 3 hours before crapping out. So, in summary: it will work but it's not a very good product and doesn't seem to have quality components to make it last. Would probably be a better idea to just to buy a more expensive one out of the gate since you'll be spending that amount of money anyway once you buy something to replace this one when it dies."
2,Lots of loud static,"I put this on my registry based on the reviews, and I should have paid more attention to the bad ones. The first few times we used it, it was great. After awhile it got more and more static, and now it's to the point where it has a loud burst of static if someone so much as walks past or bumps it. Forget about putting it near devices with more of an electrical field than a human! It's unbearable unless you hold on to the antenna, and who can sit around doing that?? Time to get one that we can stand being in the same room with. Two stars because it was great while it lasted - a month or so."
3,Great basic monitor!,"This montior will work well for basic, occasional use. I have a smaller home and have used this monitor when baby is napping to go outside and do yard work. I have been about 40 to 50 feet away and the monitor has worked perfectly for us. Batteries seem to last quite a while too. It is lighter weight and probably would hold up too well if it were dropped frequently but this isn't something that we will use for more than a year or 2."
2,terrible,"This product is terrible it constantly makes static noises. when I have my cellphone plugged in or any electronic device near it, it begins to make static noises. this happens every night at all types of hours sometimes even random static noise occurs. I just through it out."
3,"Works fine, too much white noise for my taste","I ended up returning this item because the one my sister gave me as a shower gift made less noise and I liked it better. However, this one worked just fine for its purpose. If you are a light sleeper though or can't sleep with a little constant noise, don't buy this one. It's not static, it's just ""loud silence."" But I could hear my baby perfectly when he got up and I was otherwise satisfied with it."
1,junk,"This monitor crackled all the time, you can't hear the baby over the crackle noise. It the monitor and receiver were to close together (one room apart) they would squeel."
2,Terrible monitor,This thing has LOUD static and I cannot hear my child unless she is crying loudly. It has the worst interference as well... I clearly heard my neighbor's conversation. Don't waste your money!
1,would not recommend,"this is really cheaply made. interference big time no matter what channel. do not wast money buying this. i cannot find a place to put the handheld that when people walk by, it doesn't go loudly crazy! and, it is not easy to turn off, as mostly i turn it to channel b from a. off is in the middle. people! we have enough to do handling babies. don't make it harder for us!"
3,Functional,"This does the job of monitoring noise successfully. There is always a lot of static. If you want crystal clear listening, get a different monitor."
1,White Noise,"Just got this and it's going right back. Plugged it in and couldn't believe the amount of white noise this thing puts out. I tried a few different locations and tried turning off things that I thought could be interfering with it, but I realized that's just the way this monitor is."
3,It is good but too much noise,"The monitor is really doing its job transmittinga clear and good sound of my baby in his room even on low.However, on occasion, it also makes a lot of static noise that makes me close it when I don't really have to use it. Very annoying.No light indication for sound."
1,"Volume way too sensitive, too much static","I've tried 4 different baby monitors (hand me downs from friends or from my baby shower) and this was the worst. The volume dial is so sensitive that one slight movement up, and I'm waking up to her turning over because it's so loud and a smidge downward and I couldn't hear her screaming (yeah, the worst feeling!). I even tried to mark the dial with a permanent marker to mark where the 'perfect' volume was, but even with that to help me, I found I couldn't trust that I had hit the perfect spot every time. Just because of that, I ended up throwing them away. I bought it for $20 at Target but it's not even worth that money. Also, there was a lot of static in the sound which was more annoying than deal-breaking."
4,Good quality,"For the price this monitor does wonders. I can hear my baby in the other room, with minor feedback on the monitor. I am happy with my purchase and would recomend it to others"
4,Great Monitor but must plug in,This is a fantastic monitor for the cost. My only complaint is that it eats up the battery life way too quick if it's not plugged in.
3,Good for the price,I've ordered 3 of these for use at a children's home. They work ok but have a lot of static.
1,This thing sucks,I just opened this monitor and all I get is static. I am returning it tomorrow. I bought this because I forgot my monitor at home. For $20 this is a bad choice. The monitor I LOVE is the Baby Call monitor by Sony. I paid $45 and its one of the best on the market. It is definitely worth the money.
1,Unsatisfied,"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, WhiteNot usable device at all. Lot of white noise on the receiver part. Channel switching is of no help. Got to throw the monitor away. Never buy."
2,"Works but constant, loud static","Regardless of if I'm near or far the static is so loud I have to keep the volume very, very low. I only use it when I'm doing quick chores outside while my son is sleeping. You definitely couldn't have this thing on during a whole night or nap. Very disappointing. Gave it two stars because at least it picks up my son's sounds."
3,Decent monitor for the price.,"This is a great product for anyone living in America or overseas like we are. Our apartment is made with solid concrete and I am able to hear the monitor all the way in the front of the house. We have an older child that likes to play loudly so we put the baby in the back bedroom and I am able to hear when she wakes up. I think if I were to buy another monitor I would get one that has a video camera in it, so I could also see what was going on. But this is a great product considering the price."
1,The worst product ever,"I bougth two of them, and the only thing you hear is static. I use one at the time just in case, but nothing, just static. We were changing in diferent electric output in both levels of the house, and nothing. The only way you can hear something(depending where you are), is with battery in the receiver. The battery just last one nigth. But my advise is, don't waist your money on it. I don't know why the company is using the Crystal Clear name, because the only thing you have on it is Static."
1,Worst monitor ever made!,"We received this monitor for our second daughter and could not believe how bad it was! The base was placed at the top of my infant's crib and we could not even hear her crying! We have the ""First Years 900MHZ"" monitor for my toddler and I guess we were spoiled because it picks up every noise. After using the Crystal Clear Monitor for 2 weeks, we purchased the ""Summer Infant Monitor"" and we love it! It's even better than the First Years model. It has a convenient night light on the base which comes in handy during those night feedings. It also does not pick up any static from cell phones, etc.Please do not buy the Crystal Clear Monitor. It's a waste of money...even if it is only $16.99!"
3,whistler,Whistles sometimes./////// ///////// /////////////// /////////////// ////// //////// ///////////// ////////// ///// ///////// //////////////m /// //// /////////m///// //////// ////// // //////// //////
5,Great Monitor!,We just bought this monitor for our grand babies. We love it. It has great range and no static (as long as the monitor in the baby's room is on). You can really hear the slightest sounds. So we are very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend!
4,Looks Good,I am giving this as a gift so I hope it will be ok. It looks like it would be and is suppose to work up to 600 feet.
1,Keep looking,"The frequency the monitor uses was full of static at my home. The troubleshooting guide, after suggesting simple fixes such as making sure the channels are set correctly and that the units not be too far away from each other, tells one to unplug other appliances in the home that might be causing the interference. There is a reason I have the other appliances in my home. If my refrigerator is causing the interference, I'm going to keep my refrigerator and not the monitor. When I called Safety First's customer service, I was treated rather rudely and they were unable to solve the problem. I sent the monitor back and purchased a Sony Baby Call 900 mhz 27 channel unit, which although costing twice as much, has been worth every penny.Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor"
1,Cheaply made monitor,I received this monitor and it did not work. I tried it in several outlets. When I opened the package I noticed that it was packaged poorly with the antenna's bent down to fix in the box. Plus the monitors were a very thin piece of plastic. I am not surprised it didn't work. You get what you pay for I guess.
1,This is a complete disaster!,This product just does not work. It has a noise that would not allow you to enjoy your time talking or watching a movie and does not have any led indicator - so you better listen carefully.. is just a waste of [...] bucks. no big deal
2,Buzz killed my buzz,"While the sales text says it is a ""clear"" baby monitor, this unit's constant buzz makes it impossible to have on while monitoring. You can turn it on and hear what's going on behind the buzz just barely, but the never ending buzz could be used for ""enhanced interrogation."""
1,I don't recommend this product!!!!!!,"I 've already got this baby monitor, when I pluged the monior in it was working well, but after 10 minutes it startid beeping and the green light indicator which shoes that the monitor is pluged disappeared. and it wasn't working any more. I don't know what to do:( I live so far that if I send this product back it will cost mush more than this monitor is, I 'm so sorry. So I don't recomend this product, I have to throw it away :("
2,lots of static!,"It works well enough and I love that it has an outlet plug so that I don't have to run it on batteries but the sound quality is terrible, lots of static! I honestly dont recommend this item, buy something nicer, it'll be worth it for your sanity and peace of mind."
1,A lot of Static & Background Noise,A lot of Static & Background NoiseThis unit is very bad:It has a lot of static if next to other electronic devices.I bought 2 of them & one is worth than the other.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!
2,They're just... okay,"I purchased these monitors thinking I wouldn't need to use them at all since the baby's room is right next door. I'm glad I did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there, so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort. Anyways, there are only 2 channels on these monitors, which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex. I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people's babies crying, which really weirded me out the first time I heard it. I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail (yes the door was locked, no I am not a bad mother) and was only able to hear static. I wish I had bought a monitor with more channels. Note to self: keep reciepts and packaging from now on!!!"
2,Disappointing performance,"We recently bought this monitor to replace aFisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights Monitorwhich died. This thing sounds like you are listening inside a submarine motoring through the water. I receive the audio on both channel settings, which is a bit disturbing. One channel is fainter, but still there. The background noise almost drowns out any actual noise happening in the room even on the right channel.Pros:- Price.Cons:- Background noise (tons) and very sensitive to interference and how you hold it.- Remote unit takes 9v battery. AA/AAA batteries are more economical and easier to get rechargables for.- Bulky.. Long antenna. Not as compact as our last unit.Overall: 2 of 5 stars. Barely works. Lots of noise. Will try to return it."
2,Crackly all the time,"Just ok. You can hear the baby, but its crackly and makes static noise ALL The time. Id pay more for something that will last and work more effectively"
2,Not built to last,"If you are looking to save money, this is certainly one of the cheapest monitors you can buy. We bought this after having a very dependable Whisper Connect that was interfering with security devices in our new building. However, after just a few weeks of light use, we are scrapping this one. The battery connection is flaky. If you can use the parent unit plugged in, then it might be worth the very low price-tag, but otherwise, spend the extra for a nicer unit (one with a rechargeable battery would make more sense for most people)."
5,Great monitor -- I absolutely love it!,"I got this monitor new on ebay -- it has a great range -- I love the clarity that it offers...I can tell if the baby is waking up...just rolling over...giggling in his sleep... :) I recommend it over the other, higher priced monitors."
5,very good product,"This product works very well. It has a long range, the battery last long and the reception is very good. Also the feature of having two AC adaptors helps to save the battery life of the receiver."
2,Serves it's purpose,"If you need a monitior just for the purpose of hearing in the immediate next room, then o.k. If you are trying to go anywhere else in the house and hear your baby, then don't buy this monitor. I personally don't care for it, due to the amount of static and extra noise. I can only leave it on the ""B"" setting b/c it has the least amount of static. Plus the battery life is very short. I wouldn't recommend this product.Spend the money and get a quality monitor."
3,no batteries opptions on some models,"I went to toys r us to see if you can use batteries in the baby unit you can not. I did find this same monitor somewhere else that you could use batteries so I bought it. I need a monitor that was portable. I found this to be a good basic monitor. I am able to hear my eight year at night with his breathing problems. I have found Safety 1st monitors to be the best you can buy. I also have use ""grow with me monitor"" by safety 1st its the best. I did not like fisher price monitor that becomes portable too much interference and stat with strange beeping noise out of blue. So if you look for cheap and good this crystal clear is great. There is NO interferance noise nothing but baby with this one."
3,good for the price,We have this monitor for almost two years now... It still works but there is a lot of static and sometimes it squeaks when placed next to a fridge or microwave. May be this is true for all monitors anyway. We have to keep the volume low now to avoid the static/squeak sounds.But it has served it's purpose and it is one of the things we found was an absolute must to have.
5,good product,"Filled my expectations, I really recommend it with confidence. is of good quality and can be heard clearly. I have not had any problems when using them."
4,Baby monitor,"I really like this baby monitor generally. It works well, I can hear the baby fine. The only thing I think is the volume control could be a little easier to use. It is not marked that well and I have to keep adjusting to get the sound quality I want. Other than that, especially for the price. It is very good. I do plug it in. I got tired of the battery operated ones, always having to change batteries, never lasted more than a few nights."
3,a little cheesy,"i should have known for the price i paid, it was too good to be true. i suggest getting a larger size than you wear, it is a little tight. the fabric ws ok, not a true charmeuse. all total not bad for 17.00"
4,Great condition!,Ordered this book for a summer reading requirement for my son. The price was right and the it was in great condition. I would definitely order from this seller again.
2,One more witness,"The book Winess was not one of my favorite books. This book was about a girl named Leonna Sutter who lives in a small town in Vermont. The setting for this book was in 1924 when the KKK were moving into town. She is a witness to all of this. This book is easy to read but difficult to understand, because it skips from one story to another. It was confusing but don't take my advice for it. You are your own person and you choose if you want to read it or not. In this book, the only thing I really understood was when Leonna was telling about her life. But when everybody else was telling their different stories it got confusing. The best story element for this book would be the characterization. It has so much of this in this book because it talks about different people of what they were going through. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes histroy."
2,The book was only okay,"This book is about a town who gets a little corrupt when the KKK invades. It was kind of hard to understand because of the form it was written in and i thought the story was a little weak, but it was still okay."
2,Not a good book,"I didn't like the book. It was VERY confusing because it was from the point of view of many different characters. I had a hard time understanding anything. I rated it two stars because it captured my interest less then 5 times and during those periods I only found interest for a minute. If you want to read a good book I recommend Harry Potter, A series of Unfortunate Events ,and Where the Red Fern Grows."
4,Jeff's review,"Witness was a great book. It had a lot of real things in it that actually happened, such as the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Field made me laugh a lot. However, there was a lot of death and segregation in many of the poems. The way Esther talked made the book funnier than it already was. It was a good book.Unfortunately, there are no perfect books and I thought it deserved four stars. I took off points for two reasons. One, I took off because of all the death, such as when the Ku Klux Klan killed Jerry the dog. Two, it was hard to understand. However, I did understand it and do not think it would deserve four stars if I didn't understand it. Overall, it wasn't bad."
5,"Witness,good or better?","The book Witness, by Karen Hesse, deserves 4 stars, and here is why...Witness starts out kind of slow, but as you get farther,Witness will transfer you from laying down on the sofa, to sitting on the edge of your seat.While the book takes place in Vermont in 1924, 6 year old Esther Hirsh, and 12 year old Leonora Sutter, have to accept the fact that when the klu klux klan comes to town, everyone in the towns lives are about to change.Right when the klan moves in, the towns folk know that the KKK mean no good. As the Hirshes live a fairly normal life, their life is turned by the Klan. The Sutters are also living in hate from the KKK, Leonora learns that even if they do it to you, that doesn't mean that you have to do it to them, and she also learns that African-Americans are very important on earth.This book is one of the best books ever made for sure! If you love a book that alows you to get inside the minds and consciouses of a books characters, Witness is the book for you!"
4,Witness reveiw -...,"The book Witness ,is a book, that gets you thinkingand wondering `What is going to happened next.' Witness is a very detailed book and it fells like you are in the story. This book lets all the main characters be the narrater so you can get everyone's point of veiw. Instead of chapters, like most books have, it has acts, act 1, act 2, ... The writing is free verse poetry no paragraphs.Witness is about how a small town Vermont-1924 overcomes the fear and hate towrds the ku klux klan when they go to the small town. The k.k.k. gets followers that turned in to part of the k.k.k. Their goal is to scare away or kill anyone who is not Christain. They do not completely succseed but they ruin a few peoples lives that join the klan. The small town in Vermont has to overcome their fear and hate towards the k.k.k. and work problems out together as a big community."
5,A beautifully written book.,"In this book, Karen Hesse returns to the spare, poetic style of her beautifully written Out of the Dust. This book, set in a small Vermont town in 1924, is told from the point of view of eleven of its residents, including two memorable children, twelve-year-old Leonara Sutter, who is black, and six-year-old Esther Hirsh, who is Jewish. It is a time when hatred and persecution are commonplace all over the country, even in the idyllic New England countryside. Leonara and Esther have commited no crime but to be born different from their white Protestant neighbors, but in the eyes of the Ku Klax Klan, that is enough of a reason to target the Sutters and the Hirshes, and those that would befriend and defend them. This memorable, poetic, and powerful novel explores the nature of hatred, the horror of violence, the value of acceptance, and the beauty of life, all in just 161 short pages. I can't reccomend this book highly enough."
4,Andrew Sorensen's Review,The book Witness was a very good book for young adults to adults. It is very well written and is very exciting for the reader to read. The book has everything to comedy to horror. But the ending to me was kind of slow and bad cause it did not tell what happened. I gave this book four stars because of that and the swaring. Ot had too much bad words but that was how they talked back then. The book would be suitible for the ages 11 and above so order it quick and let the adventure begin!
3,Witness by Kyle Peterson,"Witness was an OK book. It didn't really catch my attention at first. But it got a little better at the end. The book was very mysterious. It left the reader not knowing what would happen next. It's nice how it's in free verse poetry, so people could learn about other ways of writing. It had a lot of history behind it. It shows the reader how much hate America had.I rate this book thre out of five stars."
4,True review,The book Witness is a very good book for children and adults. It is very suspenseful and it is like an adventure a little comedy too. The book has irony and is a little spooky. Overall my opinion is that this book has a little bit of everything. I gave this book four stars because the ending was kind of slow and not very good and I wish there were more pages. The things I think the author should work on are the swearing and lower it down. Everyone over 9 would love the book Witness.
3,Review of Wittness,"A small town in Vermont in the nineteen twenties is peaceful until the Klu Klux Klan move in. No one is safe, especially Leanora, a twelve year old African American girl and Esther, a six year old Jewish girl. The KKK spread racist ideas and commit dreadful acts against innocent people. Fortunately Leanora and Esther survive the hate and horror that the KKK bring to the small town.In an intriguing way, Karen Hesse helps us learn about racism, life, and death in Vermont in the early nineteen hundreds."
4,Witness Of Prejudice,"We read the novel Witness in class. This book is about LeanoraSutter and Esther Hirsh, two friends. Esther is jewish andLeanora is a black person. Leanora thinks Esther talks funny.Someone tried to kill Ira Hirsh. Someone also tried to poisinthe sutter's well, it was an eighteen year old boy, who was thismysterious person? The klan is coming! The klan is coming! Whatwill happen to the towns people? Will they get someone to kickthem out? Read this exciting book and find out everything."
2,Disapointed,"I bought this book at my school bookfair after reading the summary on the back. I was really excited to read it. When I got home I read it in an hour or two, due to the simple writing format.When I was finished reading, I was extremely disapointed.I didn't find any of the events tragic, powerful, or remarkable. Although I understand that the events were terrible for the characters, I didn't find them interesting at all. The only events I found tragic/powerful were when Leanora saw the flaming cross at night, and when Esther's father was shot. I expected the characters to talk about the things the Ku Klux Klan did that were even more harsh and cruel.Overall the book was okay, but I was dispointed."
5,Glad I read it.,"I saw the author speak in Vancouver, Washington where she gave the keynote address at a local parenting conference. She was down-to-earth, friendly, and very encouraging. I'm glad I read her book. The book's introduction ""Cherish Your Wood Chips"" is a classic, insightful look into the priorities of a loving parent's heart -- and probably well worth the cover price of the book just for the thoughtful message of the intro."
4,A pleasant surprise,"For many years, this was the only Marx Brothers film I had never seen. I'd assumed it would be as weak and disappointing as their other late efforts (The Big Store, Love Happy, etc.). When I finally caught it on European television a few years ago, I was surprised and delighted to discover a true, back-to-basics Marx Brothers comedy with many funny routines and chase scenes and a minimum of distracting subplot. If several sequences ""quote"" their earlier work, it contributes to the overall reunion atmosphere. My kids and I loved the film, and I recommend it to any fan of the brothers who may have missed it."
5,A Night in Casablanca 1946,"Groucho (1890-1977) , Chico 1887-1961 , Harpo 1888-1964...Uh-oh ! it's the Nazi vs. nutsies when legendary Marx Brothers foils Axis criminals during A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA . As the manager of the hotel swirling in intrigue , Grochy is up to his fake mustache in joyful if unfilled Lechery. Chico -heywatzamatter-becomes Groucho's bodyguard by self-decree. Harpo , pantomime's clown prince, says more whistle and gestures tahn most comics say in pages of dialogue . When this 1946 film began production Warner Bros. threatned suite saying the title infriged upon the studio's famed CASABLANCA . Groucho fired back: *You probably have the rights to use the name WARNER, but what about Brothers ! Professionaly , we were before you were* .Hight Quality Transfer . Recommended"
5,Marx Brothers at their excellent!,"This movie is really great. The plot is (vaguely) similar to that of Casablanca but the treatment is completely different. Groucho is absolutely outstanding in his rendition of a looney hotel manager. With a steadier rythm than ""A night at the Opera"", ""A night in Casablanca"" deserves a place in your home if you like the Marx Brothers or even if you have not discovered them yet."
5,Excellent Resource,An architect friend of mine recommended this and it has be a valuable resource and learning tool. If you have any interest in architecture/remodeling/building/real estate or anything related. . . buy this book.
3,Lots of photos,"The book is more helpful than not, but not as much as I had hoped. I am a real estate appraiser and was looking for photos to help identify architectural styles. This book has lots of pictures and really good drawings. Unfortunately, West Coast designs seem to have been given the short stick. The copyright is 1984 - so it could really use an update to cover contemporary homes."
4,Concise and easy to read.,"The McAlesters describe the origins and progression of American architectural styles, and most importantly, demonstrate through diagrams and photos the identifying characteristics of each style."
3,Carries the Freight,"Well organized, thought out, and written. Heavy emphasis on house styles and architectural types rather than naming and describing the various pieces and parts of a structure. Overall, a good standard reference text that covers most dwelling architectural categories. If you have this one you probably won't need a second similar such book in your library."
3,architecturally impaired,"I use this book at work and around others in the building industry. Many times a client says she wants ""mediterranean"" yet when she describes what she likes, its clearly NOT medit. I can quickly correct the client. This is just like an encyclopedia of architectural styles."
5,The bible of American house styles,"Of the several dozen books I own of American house styles, this is the only book that systematically breaks down every American house style from the Native American tipi to Modern architecture. For every style, it gives the two critcal elements of architecture, the form/shape of the houses and their details. As a land developer, I use this book as a pattern book for the design criteria of homes built in my neighborhoods - every homeowner gets a copy! This is truly the bible of American house styles."
4,A Field Guide to American Houses,This is a keeper book! I keep going back to it month after month. It has home styles as they came thru history grouped by style. It has pictures of house features that help identify what style a home is. It has lots of pictures. The only weakness I can think of is it does not have a lot of information on Home-styles being built right now. AntBiscuit@cs.com
5,Fantastic book! Easy to follow and quickly find info!,Easy and very informative for the beginner in this area.
5,Great field guide!,"As another reviewer stated, I've also worn out a couple copies of this wonderful little book. It's full of information without being too wordy and it doesn't get too bogged down in unnecessary detail. The layout is wonderful and it's easy to find the info you need in a jiffy.An interesting aside is found around page 403 or so. The house picture on this page (The Spanish Mission style) is actually a Sears Alhambra, a very popular model of kit home sold by Sears in the early 1900s.This book was first published in the early 1980s, yet it's still a strong seller. That's proof of its popularity and practicality and usefulness!"
5,Melrose Place fanatic,"My granddaughter is a Melrose Place fanatic, even though her mum used to watch it when she was young. She is so pleased with the packaging and espescially with the quality of the DVD's. Her mum was lucky in purchasing a dvd player here in Australia so she could view dvd's from America. Well done once again Amazon. THANK YOU!!!"
5,Melrose Place season 6,"Super! J'ai reu le bon produit en un très court laps de temps, pas de frais de douanes, la série est bonne et tout est parfait!"
2,I expected more....,"This product is, at best, just o.k. the hairstyles were average. Some reminded me of the 80's. the good thing though, was that your could vary the hair color alot so at leat you could get an idea of what you might like. There are about 3 cds that have to be installed. Also, the makeup cd is a WASTE OF TIME. It offers drawn lips that you paste on your face! I dont know about the people that made this program but, i think its awful. If your thinking of buying this product I suggest you think twice."
2,Stick with UFC or Pride,"There are a few good fights on this one, but all in all it's pretty subpar when compared to UFC and Pride. They show one guy in three different fights. The Tim Silvia fight is a joke, it pretty much sucks. One or two good knockouts, but if you enjoy mixed martial arts this is not really one to get. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Not That Great.,"Length:: 2:14 MinsWhile ""Feel so good"" is a good song, I feel that the remix to ""Rock Wit U (Awww Baby)"" is not. This is the same remix on ""Collectables"". Ashanti mixed her lyrics with ""Rock with You"" by Michael Jackson together. While sampling the sheet music to M.J.'s song makes a great instrumental (As my video shows), in my opinion, lyrically mixing her song and M.J.'s does not. Also, When she made the hook towards the end with MJ's lyrics, it would have been a little bit more tolerable if she had kept the lyrics exactly the same as MJ's. Changing ""Just Take it slow"" To ""Just take control"" and ""Fell That Heat"" to ""Beat"" really threw me off. I think That if Ashanti had just did a full on remake of M.J.'s song, she would had a better song."
5,TUNNELS IS MASTERFUL!!,"I had never heard of this band Tunnels until a recent live concert in NJ where they opened up for a great band called 'Porcupine Tree'. To my surprise, this band 'Tunnels' takes the stage with heavy weight Percy Jones on bass, John o'Reilly (or just Reilly, maybe?) on drums and Mark Wagnon on midi vibes. I've seen many great shows in my life (Brand X,Return To Forever,Yes,Genesis,etc.......and this was beyond all of that, for me. Long story short.......I was so inspired by their performance and just had to have one of their CDs and this is the one I chose and although most studio sessions very rarely live up to the live show, this disc will be in my heavy rotation for quite some time."
2,Okay. What's the big deal?,Another of those movies that makes critics drool for no apparent reason. A perfectly adequate little movie that got universally rave reviews. There is nothing special here. Get it only if there is absolutely no other movie you have any interest in.
2,Mediocre is good?,"I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average ""bad guys on the run"" movie. Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language! A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard."
3,"BONNIE AND CLYDE IT AIN'T! BUT, IT'S NOT BAD!","I never heard of this film before 2008 and considering it's age, that's saying something. While Billy Bob Thornton has done much better(Sling Blade)it's an OK drug/crime/""thugs on the run"" film. The film starts out a little too quick for me with a couple of seedy character robbing a drug dealer. From that point on it's ""thugs on the run"" and there's no turning back. The cast is good and the story is interesting enough, but for a film that wants to get where it's going in a hurry it seemed to take a long time. It's an interesting film that should have taken some time to let us know the characters a little better. As it is, it seemed to be slow when it should have been moving fast and fast when it should have been moving slow. I caught this on cable, so it's worth a watch if you see in on TV."
3,Ok for a detective story,"The three anti-heros were the most interesting part of the movie. Their characters got decent development, whereas everybody else were mere decorations. Some efforts were taken to make Bill Paxton's hero look 3d but he still looked as if he read the script right before the shooting. I felt the movie was doing good work showing a no frills life of a group of murderers. But my wife said it was too violent for such slow movie. The ending was so lame it made me laugh."
3,cheap made,"I bought these for riding but never used.They fog inside easily, lens do not keep secure in the frame and are easily scratched.I use them with clear lenses and rubber band in my workshop now."
3,"In a way, bizarre for the genre.......","As I said, the author inserts paragraphs using poetic prose with polished wording mixed with plain action language.Anticipation and suspense have to be worked better as well as the after effect of twist and turns to provoke the anxiety of the reader to grab the book, not too much effort devoted to this pointCharacters are slowly crafted but swiftly killed as book is coming to an end, there are just too many, as well as events surrounding themElements from the surreal and fantastic worlds blend with reality so some chapters get difficult to follow and in the end to understand what the author had in mind"
4,A Creepy Thriller,"This book is the first work I have read of John Connolly. It has a certain southern gothic feel to it. Charlie Parker is called by a friend to assist him in a case involving the murder of a daughter of a rich South Carolinian. As he investigates, he finds a connection between the current case and a group of men that have been friends for life. Add in a plot that ties into Connolly's previous work and some ghostly occurences and you have the making of an entertaining but creepy novel."
1,more of the same,"I gave this guy one last try after liking the 1st 2 books in the series, & got just what I deserved after trying to read the dreck that is ""The Killing Kind"".More Yeccccch."
4,John Connolly at his best,"The White Road is a novel about private detective Charlie Parker.This time around Charlie is on a case in the deep south, with all the racial overtones included.Charlie agree's to help an old friend defending a black man accused of raping and killing the daughter of the richest and most powereful man in South Carolina.This book starts off dark and brooding and Mr. Connolly makes you care about his character's in their search to find the truth."
4,A good place to start,"This video is great for the magician wannabe. The step by step instructions make it impossible not to pick up kinda cool tricks and illusions. Many trick training videos leave out essential information that the beginner needs to know, and this is one of them. The tricks are easy, even a 2 year old could do them. (not really, just a figure of speach! - but they are easy) This is a must have for all levels of magicians."
5,I LOVE YOU BECAUSE,This show is very charming. The only negative thing I have to say is I am getting sick and tired of getting CDs with broken jewel cases from AMAZON.COM!
5,Another keeper from Debra Lee Brown!,"Debra Lee Brown's trademark mix of intrigue and romance will keep you on the edge of your seat. Lively characters, a terrific setting, and a red-hot love story. A winner!"
3,Good. I Liked Most Of The Episodes!,"Last year I bought this Simpsons Christmas DVD and it is good and has some really good Christmas and winter themed episodes from The Simpsons and the best is Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire, and I also liked Mr. Plow, Miracle on Evergreen Terrace, and She of Little Faith but didn't like Gift of the Magi which only had one funny moment but was mostly very unfunny! This DVD is good but lacking any good special features!"
4,I love it.,"This is nice offbeat answer to the endless Rudolf and Frosty movies that go on ;)Even my kid has asked for it a couple times.In this collection; you have: Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire, Mr Plow, Miracle on Evergreen Terrace, Grift of the Magi, She of Little Faith and the the Mr Burns Finest Moments Featurette.Overall they are not bad. The featurette I could care less about.One nice aspect of this DVD is the theme of Christmas as you will not have to sift through the box sets if you have them.However, one problem is the missing play all option. I docked it one point for that.Now if they would only make the Treetop of Horror into one set!"
3,"Don't bother, unless you're giving a gift","If you're looking for a gift for your favorite Simpson's fan, this is a good gift. If you're a Simpsons fan shopping for yourself, don't bother. The only extra is the ""Best of Burns"" which doesn't include any of the best of Burns."
4,Un bon divertissement des ftes,"La bande sonore franaise (québécoise) n'est disponible que pour les 4 premiers épisodes et non pou les 5. La qualité visuelle du premier épisode laisse à désirer, mais n'oubliez pas que c'est le tout premier épisode de la série. L'achat vaut quand mme la peine pour les fans des Simpsons.1. Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire (Homère au nez rouge)2. Mr. Plow (Le chasse-neige)3. Miracle On Evergreen Terrace (Nol d'enfer)4. Grift Of The Magi (Le Père Nol est un escroc)5. She Of Little Faith (Sans foi ni toit)"
3,Going through the motions.,"I think it was a good book, with the potential to be a much better book, kind of like the season they had last year.It got into some of the problems that manifested through out the season, as well as the years he ( Phil )was the coach there,but not enough depth and maybe a little too much arrogance to be more critical in some of the personal short comings, as well as team short falls that made this a good team (after all they went to the finals),rather than a great team."
4,Full of Excuses,"As a lifelong San Antonio fan, I was curious to see how the fall of the Lakers would be explained by one of their own. I must say it was more enternaining than expected. Clearly, Phil failed to admit the obvious, there are better teams than the Lakers out there. Maybe the triangle offense is broken, its time to fix it."
2,Bad writing style.,"The book is written in a disorderly manner. At times he jumps around so much that it's hard to follow. Entertaining and informative as far as showing life as a coach of Lakers, especially Kobe and Shaq, the two dominant players, and biggest ""problem children"" on the team. Two players who were just down-right childish at times (especially Kobe). Phil had an especially tough time with Kobe, the ever so narcisitic MJ wannabe."
3,phil speaks,"If you're a fan of the NBA, like I am, you'll find this chronicle of the 2003-2004 Lakers team good reading. The fab four, Kobe Bryant (during the rape trial period) Shaquille O'Neal, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone were predicted to go all the way to a championship. They did make it to the Finals, but lost to Detroit 4 to 1.I found the book to be insightful and interesting, hearing about the behind the scenes stuff. Phil Jackson is one of the best NBA coaches of all time (9 championships!!), that gives his insights and opinions of the game more weight than your standard reporter."
3,"Nice try, Phil","This book is fairly well-scribed but definitely lacks the insight/depth that I would have preferred from a coach like Jackson. The most absurd and hypocritical part of it all is that Phil the Moneygrubbing Hippie who only wins when he has starpower, returned to the Lakers a year later---making this book basically null and void. Typical of a person of his pathetic ilk. Not a role model for anyone. And he's a mediocre coach. Phil Jackson is the Joe Torre of hoops."
2,not living up to expectations,"I thought the beginning of the book started off well. It was exciting to read. About halfway through the book I found it to be quite boring. Quick and easy to read, but not the most interesting."
3,Maybe in Paperback,Die hard laker fan for over 25 years. The book doesn't live up to the hype. In fact I know some folks close to the organization and Jackson is not telling the full story. Especially when it comes to his relationship with Buss' daughter. It was a no brainer to keep Kobe and get rid of Shaq. It was painfully obvious to see one of them had to go. Shaq with a couple of years left or Kobe with over a half dozen. Kobe may not have even hit his prime yet. The choice was obvious and Jackson knew it. I have heard from insiders that he(Jackson) blamed himself. But in reality he knew this was going to be the last season.
4,Nice book,"Excellent read. After you read the book, you will think Phil will never coach Kobe again.It turned out Phil came back to LA, I am just wondering did I miss something or Phil missed something in the book?"
3,"good, but over hyped","a good diary of the lakers 2003-04 season as seen through the eyes of phil jackson. however, no deep secrets are revealed and jackson's criticsms of kobe bryant are way over-hyped."
3,OK,"This book was entertaning at the time of all those incidents that happened. It's not bad, only if you're a real big fan then i think you'll find it really interesting and should enjoy what Pjax has to say."
5,Calor,"I purchased two (2) Tapes, Calor & Soy and tried to pay for them with amazon.com gift card. Before I authorized it you charged one on my American Express, The other one I was able to use The Gift Card. How Do I prevent this from happening again when I want to use the Gift Card. Thank You----Carroll"
2,Entertaining book..merely propaganda,"This book is mildly entertaining, but the views expressed by Martin should be taken with a grain of salt. He picked out a few individual Jesuits out of the thousands and extrapolated ideas about the whole society on them. One sided propaganda. The one chapter on Inigo is quasi-unbiased though."
1,shockingly biased,"I admit I did not get too far in this book. Mr. Martin attacked, attacked, attacked. He did not seem at all interested in bringing a fair and even-handed discussion. The author early on showed he could not (or would not) differentiate between communism and socialism. He rather reminded me of Senator Joseph McCarthy at this point. Mr. Martin also denigrated the concept of the Church as the ""people of God"" which came out of Vatican II as if any idea of democracy within the Church was evil incarnate.I prefer writers with more open minds that can see an issue from all sides. I totally distrust Mr. Martin. I got the impression that Mr. Martin's dogma was drenched in feudalism and absolutism. I don't see either approach as positive for the Church in the 21st century."
1,sad trash,"malachi martin has used the prestige he once had as a priest in the Roman Catholic Church (and as a former Jesuit) to aid the gross spirit of anti-Catholicism in every way that he can. i made the mistake of picking up this book hoping to learn something. instead found it full of absurd conspiracy theory, ludicrous reductions, gross generalizations, unproveable accusations, and scandal-mongering hysteria.paranoids like this make me wince sometimes about being Catholic."
4,"Almost perfect, but...","....they don't last very long. They do a great job of solving leg-length discrepancy, but you will need to replace them about every month or two. Otherwise, a very excellent purchase."
4,Good choice,"I bought these for my mom who now has a 3 cm leg discrepancy after surgery for a broken femur and hip. She will still need a lift put on the outside of her shoe, but this has definitely helped. It is a bit narrow for the heel of her athletic shoes. It's fits better in her regular street shoes. But they are decent quality. I also bought a different heel lift which is a bit wider and fits better in her athletic shoes."
2,Not the best,"I've purchased this item in the past and found there are two chronic problems - they don't last very long (a consideration since they're much more expensive than other brands), and the material compresses a lot during wear which causes a 1/4 inch lift to become less. This may be a problem for anyone who is heavier. Going to try something different next time, since I was previously unaware that there are many more choices."
4,as advertised,"The lift is as advertised. Note, however, that this is not the same material as heel cups, and so does not provide the same level of shock absorption."
2,compression,I bought this lift because of leg length discrepancy and needed something that didn't compress. This is firm rubber but it does in fact compress so it is useless to me. More for people who want to be taller I think.
1,Don't stay together,The product is as described but the glue holding them together is weak. Moving them from shoe to show would not be recommended. They came apart within a week.
1,do not buy this item from amazon.com,if you purchae this item on amazon.com or from any seller on amazon.com you will be very disappointed if you need warranty service from rudy project amazon.com and all sellers on amazon.com are not authorized sellers and you will not receive warranty service
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Huon of the Horn is a medieval romance, but Norton has adapted it into a novel. King Arthur is also a bit player in this tale, so that is the setting you are talking about.This is from Huon's point of view, and we see that Huon is 'better' than Arthur, and they come into conflict over territory."
2,overpriced,"$39.99 new, but why, amazon has sony or sandisk 2GB for around $33.00 and has 16 times the storage. wich one do you want. if you can get this used for $5 and you ONLY use it for pictures or mabey 2 hours of MP3 music then I guess its not so bad."
3,"Great content, impossible typeface.","The book contains a great deal of content and information for the reader, but the typeface combined with the small size of the text and dimensions of the book make it very difficult to read. If there were a Kindle edition available I would buy it in a heartbeat."
3,Enough is....,....Enough already with all these compilations. Some which are now out of print. Basically most of Billy Squiers discography is out of print. Is he that bad that nobody wants to here his music anymore. I don't think so. It all needs to be released. There are some lost gems that need remastering. What would be cool is stop with the greatest hits and put out a box set with stuff fron the out of print stuff and you'll see it would sell just fine. Short and sweet sums up this best of Squier.
1,I thought Bugliosi was smarter than this,"There is not really anything I can add within the confines of an Amazon review that has not already been covered in other reviews I read. I would love to go to trial against Mr. Bugliosi with the evidence, but I don't think he would risk it, knowing that the evidence argues so strongly against his conclusions. It is one thing for him to write a book which he will only have to defend in interviews where the interviewer's understanding of the evidence is extremely weak, it would be an entirely different experience for him to try his case in front of a judge or jury. Clearly, this book is not an attempt to look at the evidence objectively, and many of the author's conclusions are based on ""straw man"" arguments and superficial analysis."
2,Don't Be Fooled!,"Bugliosi's book is a prosecutor's brief! While full of information, he conveniently overlooks or misrepresents much of the information in order to sell that Oswald acted alone. He cherry-picks witnesses and doctors to tell his readers what he wants them hear.At patspeer dot com, you'll find a list of all the eyewitnesses and their statements. You'll also find a discussion of what the medical evidence really shows, citing hundreds of sources, in which the various interpretations are explained in much more detail than in Bugliosi's book. There are also videos in which some of the problems re the medical evidence are demonstrated. If you're interested in understanding the issues, and don't want to be force fed a bunch of bugloney, you should check it out."
5,The last JFK conspiracy book you will ever read,I had read a dozen or so conspiracy books on JFK and watched the movie JFK a dozen times. I believed in a conspiracy and I persuaded others to believe in a conspiracy. I even wanted to travel to New Orleans to shake Jim Garrison's hand. I have also read most of the books written by Vincent Bugliosi and have the utmost respect for the man and his abilities.So when I found out that he was writing a book that reputed the conspiracy theory I was curious to say the least. But I read the book with an open mind and I now believe Bugliosi nailed it right on the head- case closed- Oswald did it all by himself. If you had made up your mind for conspiracy like I had then I dare you read this book and not change you whole perspective. If you have delved into this subject like I have then this will be the last book on the matter that you will read.
1,Here we go again,"In U.S. law a man can only be tried for a crime once. The Warren Commission failed to convict. Mark Layne acquited Lee Harvey Oswald. So this tool Bugliosi retries the case and insults the jurors (3/4 of the American people) who found for the defense.Further, Mark Layne got a conviction of the government in the Spotlight vs. Hunt case.Case closed."
1,"Bugliosi, himself, is a fraud and a kook","Like so many other Warren Commission apologists, Bugliosi paints a fanciful picture of the murder of JFK. He props up the rotting corpse of the Warren Commission Report by ignoring the vast array of documentary evidence that has been declassified over the last twenty years. It amazes me, nearly 50 years after JFK's untimely death, that we STILL have blind imbeciles willing to acquiesce to the ""official"" story surrounding the events of November 22, 1963. There is, quite simply, too much evidence of a conspiracy available for thinking individuals to not recognize that the official story is precisely what it was intended to be from its inception: garbage."
1,Fairy tale,"If you want to read a fairy tale buy this book if you want the truth go to black op radio, JFK Lancer, COPA, Jim Marrs,Mark Lane,HaroldWeisberg etl. Yes I have talked to witnesses and read everything available since the 60's. The truth is not in this book!"
1,You are a Warren Commission parrot,What you say is just repeating the lies of WArren Commission.Most of the Americans and the world citizens are clever enough not to believe in your sayings.
1,Dear Mr. Bugliosi,"As someone that has spent many years studying the assasination of President Kennedy,I am perplexed at your ignorance on this subject.Let me enlighten you.The bullet wounds on the President,a neck entrance wound according to Parkland doctors,a back of the head exit wound seen by almost all of the doctors present,a wound on the right shoulder blade to low to exit through the neck,could not have been inflicted by Lee Oswald even if he was shooting.When you take into account Connalys wounds,bullet holes in the Presidential vehicle and James Tague's wound it is even more absurd.My only question to you would be what is your real motive for writing this book?"
1,Too pro-Government and the Author is trying too hard!,"I am suspicious of a writer who has to prove his point by publishing a book of this size! It is quite an insult to other JFK researchers! Anybody with half a brain who is an independent thinker has to realize that so much more happened behind the scenes in Dallas that day! The police dept. was corrupt too and some crucial evidence was tossed out with the trash! I say read Mafia Kingfish and Dr. Mary's Monkey then decide for yourself! Please keep in mind that The Warren Commission had to go along with ""The Lone Nut Theory"" to keep Hoover happy! Do you know anything about Hoover? He was a mess! Nice try Bugliosi!"
5,"Hefty, but really good.","Having read several books on the assassination over the years, I can state that this is one of the best books written. Sometimes I wish it had been printed in several smaller volumes -- the book is really huge and hard to handle. But, ignore my complaint about its size. Buy this and read it if you have an interest in this key event in American history."
1,Watch the videos,"The fatal shot knocks Kennedy's head back and to the left, blows the right side and the back of his head out, and sprays pieces of his skull behind him onto the trunk of the car. (Jackie Kennedy climbs onto the trunk to retrieve a piece of his skull.) Line up a few coconuts, shoot them one at a time with a high powered rifle and notice which way the pieces fly. The fatal shot was fired from the grassy knoll, not from the school book depository. There was more than one gunman, there was a conspiracy--there is a conspiracy--and this book is the product of the author's wishful thinking."
1,Ignore the facts,"That clearly should be the name of this fantasy novel. Stop with the Oswald loner assasin garbage. Watch the Zapruder film, the camera does not lie. A shot from the fron, grassy knoll in JFK's right front temporal area."
1,deadweight,"Much too onerous of a book. Mr. Bugliosi, master of obsessive and compulsive, feels that he needs to address every conspiracy theory in the book in order to solidify his case that Oswald acted alone. This serves to make for overbearing, oppressive, almost unreadable tome."
1,insulting,i find the single bullet theory insulting to my intelligence. you have to be a moron to believe the warren commission i am dissappointed in buglosi i thought he was a smart man
3,A bit exhausting to read...,"Part of the problem is that by the time Bugliosi came out with his JFK assassination book a few years ago, so much has already been written on the subject already, and what he ends up doing is plowing over a lot of ground that has already been covered by both pro and anti-conspiracy theorists. I will agree it is a useful read, particularly if one tends to believe in a conspiracy, if only to have exposure to a contrary point of view. However, the book suffers from a lack of concision; overkill in terms of the amount of pages used to discredit the idea of Oswald not acting alone. It could have been a far more effective book had it been edited to about half the amount of pages."
5,Finishing What Posner Started,"This is certainly one of the very best books on JFK's assassination ever written, and should be read by anyone interested in it. Bugliosi is a well-known trial lawyer (he prosecuted Charles Manson) and, unlike 99.9% of Warren Report ""Critics,"" knows what he is talking about. His examination of the many crackpot theories about the assassination is often hysterically funny, as well as completely comprehensive. As with Gerald Posner's famous 1992 book Case Closed, no sane person can read this book without being completely convinced that Oswald and Ruby acted alone. My only criticism is that Bugliosi literally never misses a chance to carpingly criticise Posner's book- since he is selling a rival work."
5,a good read,husband purchased this instead of getting it from our library because it's so lengthy--he needed lots of time to read it. He reads only non-fiction and enjoyed this one.
1,The Elephant in the Room,"Bugliosi has still not adequately addressed the question of who Jack Ruby was and what his motivation was for gunning down Oswald. This is precisely where his argument falls to the ground completely. Oswald did not act alone, and Ruby was assigned to get rid of him before he could turn state's witness."
5,Outstanding and uncompromising...,"Vincent Bugliosi is arguably one of the brightest legal minds this country has ever seen. What more can be said for twenty years of research, trying Oswald after the fact and obtaining a conviction, and an eye for the smallest detail that establishes this book as the final word on the JFK assassination. His analysis of the facts, from every conceivable angle, and laying out all the conspiracy theories so they can finally dry up in the light of day, makes Reclaiming History a must read for every American (and certainly, along with Helter Skelter) required reading for every law school student. There is only one minor criticism, I personally wish it was in two volumes with larger type and heavier paper, but I'll blame the publisher for that."
3,KINDLE VERSION HAS NO PHOTOS!,"The Kindle version of this book does not include any of the exhibits (photos, etc.) which are referenced in the text! I have noticed this about a few other Kindle books. Initially I was very pleased with my Kindle, but I am now becoming somewhat disillusioned with it since the Kindle versions of at least some books do not include everything in the hard copy versions.I have no real problem with the length of this book. It takes a lot of words to describe an event this complex. If a photo is worth a thousand words, a few photos would add considerably to the clarity of the book. The book is interesting and fairly easy to read in spite of its length.I do not take issue with the conclusions. Clearly Oswald was the lone assassin. Clearly Oliver Stone is not the lone prevaricator related to this event."
3,"Interesting and thorough--but told from the perspective of an advocate,","This enormous assessment of the Kennedy assassination is impressively researched and seems quite thorough. But the author's background as a prosecutor and his probably well-founded disdain for most conspiracy theorists makes me feel I'm not getting an even-handed assessment of the evidence.I have the impression Bugliosi is correct in his assertion that Oswald did it and acted alone, but his repeated characterization of those who view the evidence differently as silly or deluded undercuts his objective of providing a balanced picture of the evidence.I finally gave up on a straight through reading at page 444, where Bugliosi laments the likelihood of future conspiracy theory proponents ""who will breast-feed the conspiracy loonies for generations to come with their special lactations of bilge, blather, and bunk."" Yuck."
1,A Good Fiction Novel,"I have to admit that VB tells a good story. He describes characters and events well, but he certainly has no new information that would make us believe that the Warren Commission report is true. The book would make for a good fictional mini-series, but no one should think that Vince has given us the truth. And since this book is supposed to be serious nonfiction, I can only give it 1 star.It is definitely fiction and Mr, Bugliosi can't be serious when he says that we have to believe his misguided interpretation of what he sees in the 26 volumes of the Warren Commission's Hearings and Exhibits."
1,The Truth is out there but not in Bugliosi's book,For a proper assessment of Bugliosi's disinformationist book read Jim Di Eugenio's review on CTKA Probe Website !
1,"Yeah, Yeah, Bug...it was Helter Skelter!","I got into this tripe about 150 pages before my stomach could take no more. If you want good historical fantasy, why not just get a copy of the Warren Commission Report? It's cheaper and reads better and just as silly. I predict this book will sell well enough, afterall there are still about 18% of the country that support Bush. It's like Barnum said..."
1,I'm working on a more detailed review. For now:,"I don't know why anyone would want to buy this book. Buy and read these 2 books instead:Breach of Trust: How the Warren Commission Failed the Nation and Whyby Gerald McKnight and""Hear No Evil: Social Constructivism and the Forensic Evidence in the Kennedy Assassination""by Donald Byron ThomasHear No Evil: Social Constructivism and the Forensic Evidence in the Kennedy Assassination"
3,Proves once and for all...,"that hot air consumes paper. This P.O.S.nerian tome ignores the mountains of hard evidence acquired since 1963. At least, Amazon makes it possible to get this tree-killer at approximately half its asking price. Why anyone would want it is a question, but not worth the synapse required to ask it. One looks forward to seeing it languish on the remainder tables quite soon, still vastly overpriced at three bucks. Brother."
3,How many times do we need to rehash this?,I read this already...13 years ago. It was called Case Closed by Gerald Posner!Case Closed
1,Laughable,"If this author thinks that Oswald was involved in killing JFK then he is living in a dream world. Just ask the Mafia. Oswald was their ""pasty"" Oswald even said it himself. Jack Rudy was working with the Mafia and they hired him to take out Oswald because they were afraid he would talk about how the Mafia was working with the CIA in Cuba to take out Castro. Mafia leaders hired killers to take out JFK to get back at his brother because Bobby was harassing the mob. The Mafia knew if they killed JFK, Bobby would lose his power in trying to jail some of the Mafia leaders. Wake up world, Oswald was in the wrong place at the right time. Oswald didn't even fire a shot........"
2,stoneware not break-resistant glass,"My son broke this right out of the box. The Amazon description says this is the hard to break glass that Corelle is known for. That is what I needed with 4 children......very disappointing. Repeat, this is stoneware not the break-resistant glass. They are a decent size(not tiny) and classically pretty."
4,It matches my teapot.,"I needed a sugar and creamer set and this one matched my teapot. They are a bit large, especially for two people sitting down for coffee or tea. I just won't fill them up to the rim. I haven't used these yet, but I look forward to using them. They look good on my cabinet shelf."
3,"Doesn't match the set, but that's the best part!","These came pretty quickly and nothing was broken, which is always good. It's a nice basic set to keep and use for my husband and myself for mornings, but nothing fancy. It's a pretty solid set and hopefully it will keep for a few years. I am actually happy that it didn't match the set that it was for because the set is cheap and ugly and I won't be keeping it anyway... I recommend this set for everyday use but not for entertaining.update:chips really easy, not worth the money."
3,SHADE DOESN'T MATCH!!!,"Shade of white doesn't match purchased dinnerware, as implied!!! Corelle should make accessories out of same material and colors as their dinnerware."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this set to accompany my new Corelle Winter Frost White dishes. This set does not match the dishes in style or color. The material is porcelain/stone ware and is much thicker and heavier. The creamer, sugar bowl and gravy boat/tray have ridges around the bottom. The color is off white and appears grayish to me. As a stand alone set it is fine and ironically it matches the mugs that came with the set. The material used to make Corelle plates and bowls is Vitrelle, and they are made in America. The mugs, sugar/creamer, gravy boat/tray are porcelain and they are made outside of America."
5,Beautiful rings,We ordered these rings for our wedding and they were even more stunning when they arrived than the photograph shows. One of the rings was too small so I shipped it back and within days they shipped out the correct one. We are very happy with these rings. Mine is 6mm and my husband's is 8mm. Turned out perfect.
5,Great album of great songs,"It is nice to hear these albums again all cleaned up with such great sound. I expected a bit more from the restoration on the I Could Go On Singing soundtrack portion of the cd. However, it is still good and is head and shoulders above anything I have heard on any of the compilation discs when they have used one of the tracks. I really enjoyed this cd."
5,What a great bible&what a wonderful translation!,"I just recently purchased this bible to help me study the bible more.I really enjoy the New Living Translation, because it is easy to understand.On a scale of 1 to 10,I would give this bible a 10+.What great study helps,and what a great concordance too. If you are looking for a bible,i would highly recommend getting this bible,so rush to your local Christian bookstore and ask for this bible you will really enjoy it!"
2,Good Study Bible but the translation is not so accurate.,"I really like Life Application bible, but I think NLT is good for people who just start reading English, kids or international people. The translation is not bad and easy to read, but other versions like NIV is more accurate. I am an international student too, but don't really like this version that much because the translation is not deep enough. I know some of you don't agree with me, but guess what I think update NASB is good for study bible. Life Application bible has the update NASB too, and I remember that version more."
4,Got it for a friend,I purchased this bible for a friend that has never had a bible of their own and they absolutely loved it. It has helped them so much with all the little life applications for them to see how the old bible stories still relate to todays day.
3,Ok,"I purchased this book based on the other reviews. While there are a couple of patterns of interest in this book, I would not make the majority of them. Also, I didn't like that the yarn for the patterns is referred to by weight alone, and not by the actual brand used. I find that this makes it difficult to get an accurate gauge. I'm not a big fan of novelty yarns and there seem to be quite a few patterns that use them in this book."
1,I take it anyone can publish a book,I played college ball. I was drafted. An injury cost me my football career. I know college ball and pro ball.This book is shallow and not representative of college football life. How can one guy's limited experience at a community college tell the real story? Not a good read for football fans.
3,"ok, but worst of the Lark jewelry books","I own this book, 500 Brooches, and 1000 Rings. This one is the worst of the 3, I think the other 2 are great. Overall these bracelets are just not that interesting, and there seem to be too many of them, by different artists, that are similar. One artist has 2 pieces in the book that are almost identical. I don't know what went wrong with this book. Was it the jurors? Is it that no one is making interesting bracelets? Is it that they didnt get many submissions?Its not all bad. Theres some good pieces. If you like the brooches and rings books, you should still get this book, just don't expect too much. Anyway, its pretty cheap on amazon."
1,Who are you kidding.,"Exhibit A in the case against buying books without being able to browse them first. If strapping a can opener to your wrist with adhesive tape counts as a bracelet, then there are 500, but many are pretense and most are unwearable. This book is just silly."
1,"Shows the importance of having a curator who is ""in touch""",I own 5 books in this series and they are inspiring. 500 Earrings was curated by Allen Revere. He obviously knows a thing ot two about jewelry making. This collection has little to inspire or even interest if you work in metals instead of coffee filters. I would like to return it as I doubt I'll look at it again. What a disappointment!
2,Dissapointed,"Too many conceptual bracelets, If you want to see metal been use, this is not your choice"
1,Functional is the Word,"Functional is the Word in my opinion. I did not think the selection of bracelets in this book equals the other 500 items books. The book publishing, the physical part and the photographs are fabulous. The editors selections leave some doubt in my mind as to their abilities in selecting items. I think a bracelet is to be worn as an accessory or an adornment not to be a dangerous object such as a bracelet of lighted birthday candles- A big paper wheel you can stick your arm through also stretches the boundaries. I cannot stretch my imagination enough to consider some of the selections in this book as a bracelet."
4,Did the deed,"My boyfriend used this sleeping bag and he had no complaints. However he liked how the sleeping bag I ordered (U.S. Army Cadet Sleeping Bag) had polyester lining inside and out. THIS sleeping bag only has polyester on the outside. Overall, it kept him warm throughout the nights."
3,Mixed review,"On positive side,1. It definately detects when my dog is going into an area he shouldn't.2. Seems to last about a week on a single 9V battery.On negative side?2. Too many false alarms. It goes off when the wind blows leaves in front of the unit. I wouldn't want to set it up and leave it overnight near any kind of sleeping area.3. Even when it does go off, it's a wimp of an alarm. It doesn't scare any of my dogs, and I can't imagine it actually working against a bear interested in food."
2,Alarm sounds for no reason,Mine may be defective but it goes off for no reason. I put it in another room to test and within 5 minutes the alarm sounds even though no one is in the same room. Maybe we have ghosts.
1,Baffling directions? YES! Working unit? NO! Buy at your own risk.,"SE-0306OR Alarm Combo. Orange/whiteI was really, really excited when I found this product. My thoughts were to use to warn me if anyone (or anything) got into our pop-up camper while we were camping in the boonies.I found the instructions to be confusing, however was able to set up the unit. Worked like a charm in my living room. Scared the cat off the couch. When it came time to test this unit in the wild, this unit was useless. My wife got quite impatient waiting for me try and set the Doberman so we could leave our campsite. Read and reread the directions. I could not get this unit to work for the life of me. Changed battery, said a prayer, called on ALL the Gods to help me heal this defective unit. Nothing.....our campsite was left vulnerable to critters and yahoos. Poor product, returned for a refund."
2,WRONG COLOR SCHEME IN DESCRIPTION,"Was supposed to be brown and black color scheme.When the rug came I saw Autumn Red on label and swallowed hard.Seeing that, I didn't fully open the plastic it came in.This is not the first time Amazon put wrong info on one of their product's descriptions.Needless to say I returned it(nightmare but was resolved just recently I hope.)Too bad because it was a beautiful rug,if only I had gotten what I thought it should've been.I'll give it a 2 star if you're looking for red also in the background."
5,Incredible!!,Walk a little straighter is one of the best country songs I've heard in a long time.It's a song that really hits home.
4,Interesting!!!,"This book touched on a subject that I never talk about but when I did, it was hot! Brian did a great job with this one. I finished it in two days. Good read!"
5,GAMES THAT PEOPLE PLAY!!!!!!!,"""The S.W.A.P. Game is not a book for anyone that is closed minded to read, oh no no no! This book gets you the moment you start reading it from the prologue to the conclusion! At first the characters seem to come across as one dimensional but soon you realize each character represent something that is so simple as well being human and with being human we all sometimes think we need a lil something extra other than what everyday life has to offer. If you like a fast and HOT read, The S.W.A.P. Game is one of those books that will have your leg shaking because each chapter brings you closer and closer to the meaning of ""exploration""!"""
5,Sisters of Unity Book Club.,"This was an excellent book.... The title of the book says it all. ""The SWAP game, some games shouldn't be played""...."
5,Great tool for re-enforcing reading skills,Have used several of the spectrum books with my son. They are fantastic tools to aid in strengthing skills. Will continue to count on Spectrum books.We use these over the summer to keep him sharp and even during the school year to re-enforce what he learns.
5,great movie for great price,go diego go fiercest animal rescues is a great kids movie for a great price. I have a little one who just loves watching diego and tring to find diego products in stores is impossible and most places I check tell me we had it last year but we don't carry it anymore so it was great that there are companies still offering diego products.
3,It is OK when you get it at the clearance price of $24 for the set,"It is OK when you get it at the clearance price of $28 for the set, but I wouldn't pay more than $30 for this set. It is NOT as good as what Pfaltzgraff used to be."
5,El mas inovador album de salsa de todos los tiempos,En la historia de la salsa debe de existir un antes y un despues de este album. Luis Enrique se adelanto 20 anos a la salsa de entonces.
4,"a good, quick read","the beginning of this party through me of a bit, but then it gets very interesting and hilarious. note that i am a sophomore in high school and enjoyed the play."
5,"Simple, Bold, Memorable","This is a set of 52 cards: half are capital letters and the other half are small letters. The pictures are of ordinary household objects, and they are simple and boldly drawn.My daughter, age 2, is already learning to recognize the shapes of some of these letters. We had intended to use these just with the pictures and object names initially, but she is fascinated by the letters on the back, and already recognizes some of the more distinctively-shaped letters: z, c, and a.I highly recommend this set of cards for parents who would like to help their toddlers with vocabulary development, or parents who would like to help their preschoolers recognize shapes. Nothing fancy, but sometimes the simplest, most easy to use things, are very valuable."
1,alaphabet flimsey cards,niceley detailed but very thin and flimsey...they bend very easily and we were afraid to give to our child because we feared paper cuts
3,Okay flash cards,"They are okay flash cards. I have seen better. they will do, but will probablly end up buying more..."
5,amazing hip-hop band,"I have to say that this band is amazing. I was very skeptical to listen to a Christian hip-hop band but these guys blew me away. My church had them come for a concert and when they took the stage I was amazed. Their style reminds me of The Roots and Black Eyed Peas put together. They are clearly one of the better hip-hop acts out today, Christian or not. More people need to know about these guys so they keep putting out records."
5,Great!,Love this combo pack! I bought it at just under $11 and mainly for Sweeney Todd. Definitely recommend this combo for Depp fans.
5,Fantastic Deal,"When I saw this, and it was not much higher than Sweeny Todd on BluRay alone, I had to get it. The only downside is when I watch very dark movies on my PS3 they look grainy sometimes and thus did these two in parts. However that is expected with dark movies and overall they were fantastic! I loved how clear the scenes were and how affordable two very good movies were. They came each in their own dvd case but packaged in the same box. Whoever packaged mine put them too close together and the some of the side of the case of mine cracked off, but that is a small matter."
4,what a deal,"Very pleased with the purchase, both movies are my favorites for johnny, so the opportunity to get both for the price of one was a good deal."
2,Never wear it,"The shirt was much larger than I thought it'd be, which may be my fault for not checking a sizing chart. The image on the back is splitting. Like it gets those cracks that cheap ink produces. I just wanted a sublime shirt. I should've looked around more"
5,Beautiful Martini Glass,"We added these Martini glasses to our crystal collection because Arctic Lights is our pattern, and well... the price was right. They are beautiful and can be used for serving desserts as well as your favorite drinks. They will look great on your bar or in your china cabinet."
5,Perfect replacement,My remote died and got this as a replacement. Googled how to sync this with my Civic and had it paired in 2 minutes. It looks and works just like my old remote so I really have no complaints with this thing.
5,"Just bought this for ""Heist""","I confess to being a Mametophile, one of the oddballs addicted to his quirky dialogue. ""Heist"" is the only reason I bought this, and I am certainly glad I did. Gene Hackman? Danny DeVito? Sam Rockwell? Ricky Jay? Rebecca Pidgeon? Delroy Lindo? I could listen to these guys read Mamet forever...."
5,BEAUTIFUL BRAZILIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC!,"Considering the price of this product, why settle for a compilation of bits and pieces of the Bachianas Brasileiras? Why not get all of them? They are all different and they are all very good. Here, you have all nine, on 3 CDs. Each of the CDs is a pleasure to listen to. I love music with regional flavor and this is classical music with the flavor of Brazil. The musicianship and sound are excellent. Excellent product."
3,I'VE HEARD BETTER,"ONLY A FAIR RECORDING. TRUE, ONLY NUMBER FIVE MADE IT TO THE CLASSICAL ""HIT PARADE"". YET I THINK THE OTHERS DESERVE MORE."
4,American beautiful performance of Brazilian Villa-Lobos,"Kenneth Schermerhorn and his Nashville Simphony Orchestra have reached a very good performance of my fellow-countryman and extraordinary composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Their Nine Bachianas Brasileiras sound surprisingly vivid and... Brazilian. Applauses, also, for Brazilian soprano Rosana Lamosa in no.5. Four stars."
3,wonderful music but non idiomatic playing,"These wonderful pieces are smoothly played but more as light classical than anything ""Brazilian"" in spirit. Even Capolongo sounds more in the spirit on EMI. Christina Ortiz is generally good for the piano. Take a listen to Villa Lobos mono recordings (poor sound unfortunately) as a point of reference."
5,Amazing how the emotion works...,"I love the disc. I had been waiting a long time for a more perfect video recording of this opera. A long, long time ago there was a black & white TV version from Sweden that was my first exposure. I would love to see that again. -Technology on this new one is very good, singing is great. Style is perfect. It is the story... but the long scene in the junk heap... you want to get out of there. The music is so rewarding. Lots of emotional acting here. It worked on me. Several cries of delight from the audience. Yeah, me too. Great pleasure. I want to see it again... just a day later."
2,The place to get ripped off on returns!!,"I admit, I ordered the wrong size. I paid $126.00 for my hood and they refunded me $83.00!!! They charge a 20% restocking fee, then said the difference was the shipping costs, which they insisted on sending me their label. I should have asked what the shipping charge would be, I could have sent it Priority Mail cheaper. Just please be very aware, if you have to send it back, you are going to get ""tapped"". Also the hood pictured was not what I received, it is a minor thing but the plate where the switches are should have been a light gray, as pictured, But it was black. I am not happy at all, and I would not use them again."
3,Plain old ceramic--NOT Corelle,"Though this salt and pepper set carries the Corelle brand name, it is only old-fashioned ceramic, NOT Corelle. The design is as pictured, and these are a good size for the table or next to the stove, but they do not have the durability I had expected. As a sometimes clumsy cook, I had specifically ordered these to have the added durability I have experienced with Corelle. I'd like to add the sugar and creamer but now I am not sure I can believe any of the product descriptions for these add on pieces."
3,Corelle Coordinates Enhancement Salt and Pepper Shaker Set,"They were not as smooth and polished as I expect Corelle products to be. They had little imperfections in the sides. However, if they are to be used daily, they are functional."
3,salt and pepper shaker set,"The salt and pepper shakers are very nice looking, however they are wider than they appear and are difficult to handle. They often slip out of my hands. The salt and pepper holes however are great. They are large and work very well."
2,Factory rejects?,"The salt and pepper shakers were OK, but the holes at the top were ""Drilled Off Center"", so I am thinking they were factory rejects and then sold cheap to...me. Now I am just going to give them away...Thanks,Signed,Disgruntled Shaker!"
3,Salt-and-pepper shakers,These are good salt-and-pepper shakers the saltshaker whole salt and pepper shaker holds Pepper. What an ingenious development of science. If they did not require a minimum number of words in these ratings they could be more succinct and still to the point.
4,Salt and Pepper,These do match the Enhancement pattern design but they are stoneware and not Corelleware. I knew that before I purchased them but wish that Corning had made them with the actual Corelle material. They are a comfortable size for handling and not tipsy like some salt and pepper shakers.
4,"Good quality, very large","I didn't realise they were quite this big, but it doesn't detract at all from the actual product. They are sturdy and very simple, but would go with anything. I have the Correlle white dish set so I wanted something plain. It was extremely hard for me to find plain white salt and pepper shakers. The price is decent and the quality is pretty nice, so I would definitely recommend them."
1,Booooo,it doesn't matter how fresh the batteries are it still runs slow. useless unless you like your cassettes to sound like they are playing in syrup.
4,I like it!,It's great to use because it's compact and came with headphones. It makes listening to my favorite tapes so easy!
4,Stero Cassette Player,"As a teacher, I needed this product for my English learners. The service was very good. I was disappointed to find out I could have purchased the same product at Barnes and Noble for less money."
4,Coby CX49 Personal AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player,I like my AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player. It has good tone and the volume works well. The headphones are comfortable.
1,Junk,"I wasn't even going to give this one star but have to select something. I've been though a lot of personal cassette players, from the most expensive to low end. None of them survive being dropped without some problems. I decided to buy this one because it was so inexpensive, figuring it was a throw-away once it was dropped. However, the sound quality is terrible, plus the speed varies, even when I switch batteries. Luckily, I purchased it locally and I'm returning it. Save your sanity and $$... this is JUNK."
2,Don't Bother,"On the plus side, it plays cassettes. The negatives: no rewind feature; seriously poor sound quality with lots of background noise; frequently won't play a tape until it has been removed and replaced a few times; loose belt clip doesn't stay fixed to pockets well. All in all, not worth the five bucks."
3,Better than nothing,Its works fine without any technical problems. Exterior craftman ship is not good. very cheap is what you get.
1,Not worth even the cheap price I paid,"I bought this for my mom to listen to the Bible tapes that I reviewed previously. Unfortunately it did not work, but then it was very cheap, primarily I think because no uses cassettes much anymore, but I felt it would work for my elderly parent.When I tried it, with new batteries) it never went forward backward or played a tape.I don't normally write negative reviews and usually find some redeeming quality in a product, but this one did not work for me and I had to end up buying another more expensive one at a local convenience store.It looked pretty but it just didn't work."
2,Coby CX-49 AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player,"Great as a radio. Sounds good but as a tape player it leaves a lot to be desired! I guess if you are using a brand new, just out of the box cassette, it might work okay but a used cassette - not so good. (and how many still have cassettes that have not been used?) The price though was not bad for a good radio."
2,cheaply made,This product is so cheaply made it is unbelievable. The sound quality is terrible. When you insert a cassette be careful not to bend the pin that sticks out inside of the unit that fasten in the cassette. The radio will not even begin to pick up weak stations. My wife wants to keep it because it is portable.
2,"So So purchase,","I purchased this product for a relative who still enjoys working out with a cassette player. The sound is fine, but when you try to close the battery compartment it does not play. The battery has to be out a little for it to play, therefore you cannot close the compartment. I was disappointed with this product."
3,You get what you pay for,"I was so happy to get this item as they are not easily found these days. However, I have had difficulty getting the play button to stay down. I use this for playing my ""Praise Walk"" tapes! Thanks"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I'm going to bottom line this for all of you that are considering this because the price is so reasonable. You get what you pay for and this is a first class piece of JUNK! I listen to cassettes all the time and I buy an average of one a month because I can't find other brands in the stores. If you just want to listen to a radio maybe it's okay. Like I said, SAVE YOUR MONEY, spend a little more and get the Sony."
1,Cassette Player fiasco,This product was cheaply made. Plugged in the headphones and it worked perfectly and I listened to the radio. Tried to use it a few days later to listen to one of my cassette tapes and the headphone unit would not fit into the unit properly. The player was exactly what I wanted and it is a total disapointment. Do not think it is worth the hassle to return it.
2,Cassette Player,"It unfortunately did not work properly. Seller made it right. It played only one time and when I rewound it, the play button would not stay down."
1,"Coby, you suck","Opened my package, took out the cassette player, and discovered the play and fast forward buttons don't stay down. What a piece of garbage. Stay away from this product."
2,Coby Cassette Player,"I ordered the Coby cassette player to replace the previous Coby cassette player to transfer my cassettes to MP3 format. I found that these units have a tendency after a while to lose the ability for the play button to lock into place, forcing me to hold the play button down with packing tape. It doesn't take that long for the locking mechanism to wear out either. If cassette players were more readily available from other vendors, I wouldn't waste my time on the Coby."
4,Good,Our son is multi-handicap and can't master a Cd player and it is hard to find cassett players any more so thanks for helping us out. Amazon has been helpful in this area on many occations.
4,coby walkman cassette review,"Item was delivered on time & works well & price was reasonable.I wish that I had known that cassette player plays tapes continuously instead of stopping at the end of the tape, which can be inconvienent when working out."
1,Steroe Cassette Players,"I would not recommend this product or this supplier. First of all, the shipping costs were ridiculous! ( I don't know why I even went through with the order). Secondly, I ordered 5 cassette players and only 2 of them worked. I did not return them because of the additional shipping costs...not worth the time and definitely not the money!!!!"
1,Unusable Product,I have bought 3 of these in the past 6 months because I was desperte for something to play a cassette on. None of them worked for more than a few hours. Very cheaply made.
3,Low quality but cheap,"I needed this tape player urgently in order to review some old recordings that do not exist in any other format. The quality of this item is quite low, but that can be expected already looking at the price. It was nevertheless a shock that it drags the tapes and so makes it very hard to understand some of the words stated on the recordings. The voice becomes too deep and words are dragged out too much.I checked the player with three different sets of batteries as well but the problem is with the product itself.If for someone that would not be a problem or if you only plan to use this item as a radio, I can recommend it for you. I never tried the headset that comes with it, but the radio function worked fine with my other ear-buds."
2,Poor Product,"This product eats up batteries, and has terrible radio reception. The tape player works good, but that is about the only thing good about it."
1,Don't get it,There is no rewind button AND it didn't even play tapes properly when I took it out of the package! I had to return it right away.
3,GOod product,For those who still have cassette tapes it works well. I do not use the headphones as ear buds are more comfortable.
4,I liked it.,I have always wanted to bring back the walkman having a walkman never gets old you can listen to your favor radio stations.
5,okay,The product is okay. I guess you just get what you pay for. The service was great. Have a nice day.
2,Not good.,"I admit that i read the billion one star reviews on this product but for the money i took a chance.It worked good for a couple of days and i thought that i got lucky but no cigar.It started lagging so i changed batteries""duracell"" and still the same problem.The headphones are adequate but the earpods aren't,only one side worked.My wife uses it because she lucked out on the fact that the only station it picks up is a country station that she likes and i don't like country.It does have an intake for an adaptor so one can save on batteries but that is the only quality i liked about it.I can't believe that amazon is still letting Coby sell this on their sight with soooo many bad reviews."
2,NO REWIND!!!,"There is no record function which is fine, but no rewind?? I played a tape in it for about a minute and it seems to play fine, sound seemed ok. I don't know how the radio works because it's not a featrue I need or want. I'll give it to my kids to play with because without a rewind, it's of no use to me."
2,"Cheaply made, few functions","It plays tapes, barely. Since audio tapes are disappearing, it's not surprising that these machines are too. These will be gone before the tapes."
1,Didn't work for me...,"After plugging in the cassette player, it made a popping sound, released an odor of burning plastic, and did not play."
1,Not used easily,"Tape does not fit into the area easily. Have to take tape out again and again to get it in exactly right. No problem with seller, just product. But I only paid $10 for it. Would like a cassette player of higher equality and be willing to pay more."
1,HORRIBLE - Can't even hear over the static,"I came into this purchase as a long-time Amazon customer knowing I was getting a cheap player... but it came with no electrical cord (although there is a place for one), unclear directions for the direction batteries must be inserted (they are just blank circles) and the battery cover fell off in 2 secs. What prompted a return? I then couldn't HEAR anything on the tape! All noise from the machine's drive - even without a tape inserted. Horrible. Love Amazon, hate this machine."
1,Do not buy this garbage,"This item is absolute junk. First, it doesn't even have a rewind button. That's like buying a car without a reverse gear. Second, there is no AC adapter available. It doesn't come with the player and isn't available to be purchased aftermarket. One can only use batteries. Oh, how I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchase. Amazon should be ashamed to even sell this item. And I haven't even gone into its performance deficits."
4,great for people who still have cassettes,"My mom asked me to find her a portable cassette player as she has her walking tape on cassette and her old one had broken. I ordered this for her and she is so thrilled with it she will probably order another while they are still available. We looked everywhere before we checked Amazon , now I always check Amazon first for any item I need."
1,AWFUL!!!,"I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. The radio works fine, but when playing a tape the batteries last all of 5 minutes. I didn't return the player because I received it the day before going on vacation. Don't order this product if you intend to play tapes."
1,Not a good choice,We bought 2 of this last month. One we exchanged because it was defective. The other worked for a couple days but it's useless now. Very disappointing to say the least. Consider another choice!
3,DON'T FORGET!,"This is a nice looking, easy to operate cassette player. The one thing you must have to make your old cassette tapes play at the correct speed is the electrical adapter which does not come with the player. It must be ordered separtately."
2,get what you pay for.,The first one I bought stop working after a shot time. The second (I must learn slow) has poor sound. By the way the radio will not work with out the head phones.
1,No Rewind Function,"A cassette player without a rewind function is pretty much useless to me. I discovered this flaw when listening to a tape and wanted to replay a section and found there is no way to rewind the tape. What is the point of having a tape player if you can't rewind the tape? If you don't mind the fact that there is no rewind function, it otherwise operates fine."
1,Warning!!! Burned 6 yr old! Very Bad Product!,"I ordered this hoping the bad reviews were a fluke. My 6 yr old needed a new cassette player and there is not a lot to choose from in the cassette player selection. But waste your money on this product. I put batteries in the player, and a few seconds later my daughter brought it to me telling me it felt hot. I took the batteries out to make sure they were inserted correctly. They were. Reinserted them and gave it back within a few more seconds the metal on the headphone jack heated up enough to burn my daughter. The entire area around the headphone jack was hot. I was seriously afraid the unit was either going to melt, catch fire, or cause the batteries to explode. I can't believe this company is able to distribute products like this!On the other hand, as always, Amazon was stress-free in issuing a refund. No problems at all with Amazon."
1,Disappointment,"Coby CX-49 AM/FM Stereo Cassette PlayerI had ordered 5 of the Coby's for my classroom. I opened the product and placed new batteries in them. Didn't work. Tried other new batteries. Didn't work. No matter what combination of batteries I used or how much I tried, NONE of the 5 Coby's worked! Very poorly constructed product to boot!"
1,Cassett player,"Not as high a quality as I was hoping for but as they say ""You get what you pay for""....so I suppose I got a good deal....the sound is not good at all, but I kept the item. Cassette players I know are almost obsolete, but I have lots of books on tape I enjoy listening to...when this one dies I'm buying a better quality."
2,Defective COBY,"I had a Coby identical to this one that I used for years with no problem. It simply stopped working & after all the years I'd used it, I was not surprised. I liked it so well, that I replaced it with this new one. My new Coby has already ""eaten"" 2 tapes damaging those tapes. My experience with ""tape eating"" players is that once they begin eating they are never reliable again. This Coby needs to be returned & replaced with another one. I like Coby CX-49. I think I just got a ""lemon."""
1,piece of crap,Do not buy this complete piece of crap. It does not work. The buttons are falling off. The battery access door doesn't open wide enough. This manufacturer should be avoided for producing such a complete piece of crap! I only rated this cassette player with one star because it did not allow me to put zero stars.
1,Terrible - don't buy,"The Coby cassette player may be cheap, but it is expensive if it doesn't work properly! Within 1 week it fell apart - literally. Whatever you do, pay a bit more and buy a better quality player."
2,Ooops,Both channels worked correctly for about two days and the fast forward worked correctly for half that time.
2,This stuff blows...,"This stuff blows... it's expensive. it stinks. and it doesn't produce a gale force wind as promised.I decided to go out on a limb and buy a specialized air compressor from the local computer repair shop and it is the best thing I have done, it has a water filter / trap and is quiet, odorless, and zero waste for the environment, it has no long term costs. Unlike these cans which are not cheap to begin with, the compressor will pay for its self and removes the INHALANT hazard in your house.These cans are DEATH waiting to happen for a child or teen who gets their hands on it looking for a high."
3,mediocre,"I've used better. This duster DOES contain a bitterant which can leave a film on parts you need to stay clean. Had I known that I would have bought a different brand. It loses its punch fairly quickly and the trigger acts funny from time to time. You get what you pay for every time, I should have stuck with old faithful..."
2,A Bitter Wind Blows,"I've made several comments against bitterant on other air dusters and in the end I went with this one because there weren't any comments (at the time) stating whether or not it included it or not and nothing in the description at that time noting its presence either. Its no surprise now (as other reviewers have commented) that I got ""bit."" Yes the product contains bitterant, but not to a degree that I could detect from smell, though others may be more sensitive to its smell than myself. Aside from that it does do the job it is supposed to do, initially. The air pressure drops after a few sprays and it becomes all but ineffective. I ordered two packs (4 cans) and the result was always the same. I'd bought a different brand at Staples about a year ago, that really did the job down to the last spray, but of course they were out of it at the time. One could definitely do better than this."
4,can of air,We all know what these are and what they do. Yes it did blow air.It lost a star because I felt it should have lasted longer based on the size.
2,Inconsistent,"This is pretty good of a spray the very first time you use it. Then, the power weakens considerably, adding many more minutes to the simple task of cleaning out my computer, and costing me to use more/both cans to finish. And if you use it, be sure to use some sort of glove, as the can quickly freezes, especially for larger jobs like cleaning out a computer. I definitely will not purchase this product again. Spend a little bit more, and you may actually end of saving time and money."
1,junk dont buy,"you will get frost bite and destroy anything that you use this on, dont buy this crap, use your air compresser not this."
4,Seemed Fine Despite Bitterant,"When I ordered this, I hadn't read the reviews regarding bitterent in the product. After recieving this today (July 11, 2012), I did an unscientific experiment to see if this would leave a film behind or cause damage to my computer. I first sprayed my palm to see if I could feel anything ""filmy"" and I also sprayed a hand-held mirror. I couldn't detect anything that seemed like a film or coating. As far as the bitterent itself, I'm not sure that any hardcore huffer would be put off by this sort of thing, so it's sort of a shame that those of us looking to get our electronics dusted have to worry about these additives."
2,not great,"I purchased this for the purpose of cleaning out the inside of my desktop, and was influenced by the price (and qualifying for Amazon Prime). Other reviewers mentioned the product had a short lifetime and that the velocity that the air came out of the canister decreased very quickly. I found this to be true. It did seem that the velocity increased for a short time after ""taking a break"", but the trigger also seems to be fairly flimsy and I was nervous to press it down really hard cuz I thought it might break. I also noticed I got better results by keeping the canister level (per the instructions).The other non-prime options were more pricey incl shipping, next time I'd probably go over to a close by staples or radio shack (assuming they carry something like this)."
2,"Blows air, but with drawbacks","Pros:+Does the job.+Comes with a straw.Cons:-There is so much bitterent that I touched the straw after use, ate some finger food, licked my fingers, and died for the next half hour.-Feels like it runs out quickly.There really isn't much to say. I'd try a different canned air next time."
4,Great Value,"This product more than met my expectations, Arrived quickly and packaged great. The reviews were very helpful regarding the coldness of the can but I had no such trouble and it worked really well cleaning up dirt and detritus up in a variety of places."
2,i had no use of this,"I really had not much use of this. I had a lot of dust stuck in my keyboard, fans, etc when disassembling my laptop, i used this as instructed to blow air to clean it. It didn't really do a good job. I found the air spraying out isn't any faster than I can blow with my own breath anyways. And a much better way to clean is use rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab. And carefully use tweezers to get any hairs stuck between the keys. So, I am not sure what else people use this for. By the way, the can will get really cold so wear gloves when you use it... if you chose to use it."

4,Great for Work,"This lunchbox is great for work if you don't have access to a refrigerator. I used two of the small refreeze ice blocks to keep things cold. The bottom compartment held two ice packs, a bottle of water, a bottle of vita-rain, a can of diet coke, a yogurt, and a sandwich. The flatware in the front is very nice. The top compartment is roomy enough for dry snacks. I even had room for my hat and gloves for the springtime snow storms here."
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT--EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS,This lunch box is really larger than i imagined and more than held what i needed it to hold. It looks quite compact for the amount that it holds. Would definitely recommend this product.
1,Does NOT hold what's in picture,"I wanted a lunch box that would carry me throughout my day at work. This lunch box,although bigger than the standard, does not hold very many things. And, contrary to what some people wrote, it does not keep things cold for any duration. I put freezer packs to help keep items that needs to be cold a proper temperature."
2,Its Really Picnic Set,I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good. When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people. I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch. The Pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox.
3,It is okay,It is a little smaller than I wanted. The picture is a bit deceiving. If you are going to use containers you will need to use small narrow containers
4,Good entry level,"Good book on how to get what is coming to you & also cover your own butt. Ringer's 2nd book and best seller, ""Looking out for #1"", is best in this topic, as it covers more ground. Winning through intimidation deals too much with using lawyers to intimidate when involved with real estate deals (as a broker)"
3,You must really be a Ringer fan to read this one!,I found this book to be geared towards deals in real estate it has a few gems at the beginning in true Ringer style. The book is a good read if you are a true Ringer fan. He puts the truth on the line with a no-nonsense approach and gives ideas which help with dealing with many situations that actually confront all of us from time to time. I recognise a lot of sitations like this in my life; and am surprised this was actually written in the seventies. He obviously was way ahead of his time. The title can be misleading the book is more of a self help book; moreover based on reality. I have enjoyed reading his books you get to read the truth which can be both painful and pleasant.
3,Average Book,"I bought this book three days ago because of the hype and high recommendations from Dan Kennedy et al. The first one-third or so was interesting and insightful into human nature. Shockingly it then went on tediously to discuss details of real estate business which do not add materially to the subject of intimdation, street wisdom or survival tactics. I trudged on hoping the last 20 or 30 pages would deliver gem but that did not happen. The book could have covered the information thereinin in half its pages. I thought the author would give more vivid methods of positive intimidation --overpreparation, strategies, etc, that give little chance to an oponent. Talking of human nature and the law of the jungle is better done by Desmond Morris in the book ""The Human Zoo"" (which I read about 40 years ago!)"
4,Classic,"Finished Mr. Ringer's classic this morning. After ""hearing"" of the book for years, about six months ago I purchased a used hardback and put it in the queue. As many others have pointed out, this book isn't so much about intimidation as it is about ""NOT"" being intimidated by others. He provides real-world counsel when he advises that closing the deal is not the goal; getting paid is the goal---and apparently in his industry (real estate) this can be a role of the dice. I enjoyed the book in the beginning, but after a while his details of real estate successes and failures became tedious. He wraps up nicely with some penetrating questions for the reader. I would recommend this to anyone trying to build their confidence. I'll keep on the shelves as a reference and will recommend to colleagues and friends."
5,MORE RINGER NEEDED,"It is out of print but the best book I have read 30 years later is the Libertarian teatise ""Restoring the American Dream"" that I read at 18 and have never viewed the world the same since."
1,Don't read this book if you want to succeed in business!,"This book is picked up all the time by people who want to succeed in business. The people that I've seen, that have really lasted in business tend to be built of strong values. Now, I'm sure there are exceptions to that rule, but being a bully is not the way to maintain customers, clients or other business relations. This book tries to make people into what they are not, when they should instead focus on who they are. This is just a mass-market-appeal book, with a catchy title."
5,Great book BUT SOLD BY OPPORTUNISTS!!!,"First, let me tell you that I loved this book! I read it over twenty-plus years ago, and still use Mr. Ringer's insight to life situations. About ten years ago I bought this book for both of my sons and several friends, who also appreciated it. I recently found it again on Amazon for my wife's cousin. Luckily, I bought it for a great price, less than ten bucks, which included shipping! But now some OPPORTUNISTS ARE ASKING TOO MUCH FOR THIS BOOK! If Robert J. Ringer would have sold his book for what they're asking, he would have been a millionaire a lot sooner! $90.00? Not me, Buddy."
5,Don't Let Them Ring You Bell!,"A classic in an important aspect of interpersonal relations. Yes, it may help you become more assertive; but, it also helps you see the intimidators coming and prepare for them accordingly."
4,Better suited for business than private interactions.,I know that it is supposed to translate into all areas of you life. But the book applies more to business than interpersonal interactions. It is useful if you work in real estate.
4,Don't Be Intimidated By The Title,"The title of this book can put off a lot of people who don't like to think of themselves as ""intimidators"" and thus are more interested in reading a book that would not have them taking on an Alpha-Male approach to getting ahead in life.When the book refers to Winning THROUGH Intimidation it does not mean ""Winning BY Intimidation"" but rather ""Winning Even While Passing Through a World of Intimidation"".Good book for most anyone involved in sales and business building enterprises."
5,Great Book,"I read this book quite by accident, picking it somewhere and flipping through it initially. the title is a put off and should have been changed. i simply loved the book. it teaches you how to be hard nosed and deal with difficult and crooked people and how to outwit them. the style is easy and entertaining and its not the sort of book that would bore you. i am a corporate lawyer with a keen sense of how one has to be smart,shrewd and cunning in ones dealings and this book tells it all. i made it required reading for all lawyers in my office. its one of the top 20 books i would give a lawyer to read."
4,Celebrate the Turtle,Excellent. I actually laughed out loud twice. This book is easy to relate to and is a fast smooth read. Robert Ringer highlights people's perception and how to use that to your advantage. A confidence builder.
5,Classic!,Who in business (especially real estate) hasn't met the 3 individual personalities this book describes.Brilliant clarification of a common reality.I'm glad someone could articulate it.
4,Finally a mystery with real life characters!,"Got a hold of an advanced copy of this book and is the first one of her Liz Sullivan series that I've read. I loved her real life characters. Intriguing garden mystery that involves a free-lance writer trying too eek out a means of living as best as possible but at the same time meeting everyday life characters who are jealous, backstabbing, fru-fru, and murderous. Great to see a main character also who has the support of friends who are moms as well as older women. Happy to see a main character who also 'feels' rather than just being. A true multidimensional character. Also glad that the romance is kept to minimum, that women don't always need men to rescue them in whatever situation."
2,Lame,"I don't think even Liz cared who dun it. This mystery was severely lacking in mystery. It was mostly about Liz driving back and forth to the garden and obsessing about whether to make it with Paul Drake. (Maybe in the first book his silly name was explained - Paul Drake as in the old Perry Mason series, I presume.) I found this boring and preachy. I don't think I'll read another in this series -- I enjoyed ""Murder in the Marketplace"" -- but I'm tired of Liz's poor-but-happy-I-can-shop at-the-thrifts personality. Let's face it - is there a woman alive who doesn't crave a new piece of clothing sometimes?"
3,Where WAS everybody during the killer event???,"I like reading Roberts for the local color, cast of characters. Hey--it's where I'm at; and we ARE like that, many, often, almost daily.. (Not coo-coo,though-except for individual passions...like those composty diggers).However, this book lacks credibility in its basic plot. Cause however could ""that"" happen with all those people milling around? Of course I read to the very end."
3,horror,i got this movie only because it was a part 1 and part 2... i haven't seen the other parts.. but boogeyman 3 was ok.. it had some scary parts.. but.. my grandbaby loves scary movies.. he watched it more than i did.........
4,third boogey,This is the third boogeyman movie and it's still fresh. I like this one and the second way more than the first movie. The deaths are interesting and the girl slowly losing it is always fun to watch. The boogeyman is cool looking and at least it relates well to the other two.
5,WOO!,"I recently bought Boogeyman 3 b.c i have the other 2 Boogeyman movies and i think this Boogeyman and the first one are my favorite horror movies! i liked this one alot. the special effects were great and they designed the Boogeyman like a boogeyman should look like, unlike the 2nd movie.Great job! love it."
1,Horror? Ha Ha,"If you've seen obviously red dyed water pouring down walls or out of some fixtures and a black cape from any Halloween costume display store then you've seen this movie many times before. Unless, I figure the following:(1.) If you gave it 5 stars then this is the first horror movie you've ever seen (or you work for the studio).(2.) If you gave it 4 stars then you once saw a horror movie in the 70s.(3.) If you gave it 3 stars the you're Pollyanna's offspring and you are kind even to spiders and slugs.Finally, since I watched Vacancy 2 the same day I conclude that I must not have a life."
5,Witty fashion and fashionable wit,This book is simply brilliant. Krum is obviously a true New Yorker and weaves a entertaining tale of one New York woman's quest for love. She unearths every woman's desire for the glamour we grew up watching on the big screen and television matinees before the advent of Lifetime and WE. Krum's attention to detail and storytelling ability makes this a book that you'll want to read.
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"The main character is completely unbelievable. The little ""glimpses"" into the thoughts of all the other characters are often pointless and always distracting. The premise of this novel, a woman changing her entire personality, wardrobe, and life, just to get a man to stick around, is not the worst idea in the world, but the author did not handle it in a believable or even readable fashion. Two thumbs down, way down."
3,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"Usually I try to avoid reading books with implausible plots. Too much suspension of reality makes me overly critical and I get so caught up in thinking ""now that couldn't really happen!"" that I'm unable to enjoy the book for what it is.""The Thing about Jane Spring"" falls into this category for me, but really enjoyed it's Ally McBeal-type humor. Jane was a great character - completely competent and successful in her professional life, but inept when it comes to sustaining any relationship. Her self-improvement campaign starts off as a way to attract men, but Jane sees how some of her changes in how she interacts with others benefit her in many ways. This would make a wonderful movie.A great escape novel - enjoy!"
4,Enjoyable and a quick read,"For a good part of the book I really wanted to climb into the book and tell Jane to watch something a bit more contemporary, like ""Sex and the City"" as opposed to Doris Day flicks. But, after a while I got it. That Doris Day persona really worked for Jane and the story.I had a hard time during the beginning of the book accepting that someone could be so absolutely clueless about herself. I loved her list of qualities she tells Grahm that men are looking for in a woman.The story moved along well and it was great to get brief glimpses into what the other characters were thinking.I like that it wasn't your typical makeover story- she didn't run out for a designer haircut and super trendy clothes. It was a nice twist and break from most other chick lit book. It was a positive, fun story. I will look for more books by this author."
4,"Light, enjoyable, and a short read.","I enjoyed reading this book mainly because it was short, light, and didn't involve a lot of lawyer talk. I hear it's supposed to be made into a movie. I'd go see it! I enjoyed the remake into a Doris Day type character. The only thing tht bothered me is that some of the quotes used did not come from the movie. Two quotes supposedly from Pillow Talk(Chapters 30,34) were never in any version of Pillow Talk that I ever saw, and I just watched it again yesterday to make sure before writing this review."
2,"Entertaining, Atypical Romance Novel","Chick lit, where the heroine is not immediately likable--gruff, pro-military, masculine, totally clueless. In an effort to win over men, she adopts Doris Day's mannerisms and discovers that they work to her advantage. The writer's voice makes the book funny and easy to read. But I found myself gagging a lot over the Doris Day references--it felt incredibly antiquated and old-fashioned. In general, though, characters break out of the typical romance novel archetypes."
5,Must Have for the Beach,"Krum's light, chatty style of writing pulls you in from the start. You want to know what happens to Jane. I'm sure everyone knows someone a bit like Jane. I had a little movie in my head as I eagerly turned each page to see how Jane would evolve. It's a cleverly written, fun read. The world needs a little shot of Doris Day!!!"
3,Life Imitates Art,"Very cute tale of a woman's extreme search to find out what men really want. Full of impossible scenarios and the overlooking of the obvious, the book still provides enough pulling of the heartstrings to keep the pages turning. Very readable and fast paced. You may see the ending coming, but the journey getting there is still delightful."
4,Cute!,"I enjoyed this book a lot! I thought it was a cute story and an interesting take on how Jane feels she ""is"" and how everyone else perceives her. I could certainly identify with her about that.Since I know nothing about Doris Day movies, I have no problem with the quotes used. (Other reviewers have mentioned this as a problem.)Overall this is a light-hearted and cute chic-lit novel! The usually tiresome ""makeover"" trope is used in an odd and funky way.I think this could make a cute little movie. It seems as if it would translate well visually.If you liked this book, you may want to try ""The Little Lady Agency"" by Hester Browne or ""Elegance"" by Kathleen Tessaro or even books by Jennifer Weiner, Jane Green, Anna Maxted, or Marian Keyes."
3,Typical mystery with Egyptological bits of interest,"I really wanted to like this book, because I'm a sucker for anything about Egypt. However, the mystery of ""The Assassins of Isis"" was not that difficult to figure out, and the police procedures were a bore. The characters are good, especially the dwarf who amuses the judge and finds clues almost by accident. I never did understand why Doherty insists on calling the famous female Pharaoh Hatshepsut ""Hutusu,"" because I have never heard that name used anywhere. With all the odd names that abound in this book, there's little reason to change a well-known historical figure's name.I'm going to try another Doherty mystery and see if they get any better. But this one was only passable."
2,By Far on the Lower End of The Spectrum for African American Quote Books,"African American Quotation books are great tools-- mostly for their inspiration and for the broad range of subject matter and wisdom. This one is at the lower end of the spectrum for a number of reasons. There is more than a fair amount of hate in these quotes, particularly due to the mind-numbing over-abundance of quotes by Louis Farankaht. (Why?) Many of the quotes aren't by African Americans at all (Naomi Campbell, for example, is a favorite here). And the choice of Campbell's quotes are strange, particularly where they include a quote of her saying how she wants to be remembered not as a model but for the good she's done as a person (poor choice, considering that she's mostly known as a person for breaking the law and beating up underlings). The book is also poorly structured, and generally lacking. There are only a small amount of subjects covered, lacking in subjects outside of specifically racial issues."
4,Meditation Essentials,This is a general guide to beginning a daily meditation practice. It includes various types and styles of meditation and the plus is that you can start with just eight minutes per day.
2,Found More Success in another book,"8 Minute Meditation was an interesting topic read, just not that practical. The techniques were to complex and couldn't master them. I did learn how to meditate through another book: ""Psychic Development For Beginners"" that also taught me other important focusing, and mindfulness skills.Best of Luck"
2,Long & drawn out beginning chapters...,"This book takes forever to get to the parts on meditation. Too much repeating of itself in the first few chapters. Once the book gets into gear, I found it almost too basic, too general. I'm still going through the process described in the book, so we'll see what happens."
3,Only So-So,"Considering its impressive endorsements, I was expecting something better. I'm only on Week 4, but have to admit that the feeling meditation in Week 3, and to a lesser extent the hearing one in Week 2, were difficult for me, and I did not get into a 'meditation zone' the way I was able to dip into for short periods with the Week 1 and Week 4 meditations. I think it would have been better to have solidly established breathing meditation before going on to the others, even if that meant 2 weeks on meditation 1, and six days for the remaining 7 meditation styles."
4,"It's not zoloft, but close","In light of the research on heart disease and depression showing the benefits of meditation I thought I could try this. Meditation was a very abstract concept to me. I thought it was something that certain religions did. I didn't realize it was a non denominational way of totally tuning out and tuning in. It opens your mind, hightens your senses and affects you in ways that sneak up on you. Your mood, focus, stress level, and senses change. You learn to see things differently and feel solid. Thanks Mr. Davich."
2,cant get into it,"Not crazy about the author. Very boring and hard to get into. He repeats not to skip parts, but i couldnt help it. Aside from that, it hasnt interested me enough to get far into the book. Ive had it for months. Not my kind of meditation book."
2,Cheap book with little info,"You can find better meditation info online, for free. The book is cheap, and does not include very good information. I have been meditating for years."
2,Limited content,"""8 Minute Meditation: Quiet Your Mind. Change Your Life"" left me waiting for something more. It didn't offer anything new. The ""follow your breath"" technique is outdated and over-used. S. Broes"
4,Good for entry-level meditating!,"Some might say ""only 8 minutes?"" How much good could that do? But it's a good way to get started if you want to get into meditation. It adds up over the course of 8 weeks. It's a little irritating getting beyond the opening pages of the book to the actual meditation part but it turns out to not be so hard, at least for 8 minutes at a time. Some of the meditations will work for you better than others. It's worth a try."
4,"Don't Kill Dreams, Release Them...","Dream Releasers is a book about releasing the potential in others. It also is partially about releasing potential in oneself. It seems directed primarily to the Church audience, but also has application to the secular population.Encouraging, while practical, Dream Releasers tends to meander. Some sections are bullet pointed, and thus helps to pinpoint a specific direction. The center of his book, titled 'Dream Killers' walks through a such useful bulleted section. I particularly appreciated his simple, straight to the point discussion of dangerous 'killers' and helpful cues and stories of overcoming them.Sprinkled with heart warming, moving personal and other illustrations and stories, the book is a quick read. A worthy book to slip in your bag for easy reading that will help produce thoughtful meditation."
4,A good little hometown whodunit,"Being a native from the area in which this murder/romance takes place, the first thing I noticed was how I would visualize at the local areas Ms. DeWitte mentioned in her first book. Not to say that the plot was secondary as I read it.The forty-something heroine is at ""that"" stage in her life - kids gone, recovering from a sticky divorce and seeking to re-establish a social life. And wouldn't you know it, as things start to look up, a corpse finds it's way to her door step.A honestly found myself feeling an attachment to Lily as the trauma, bodies, heartache and a few too many glasses of wine catch up to her. A lot of fun and a good beginning effort. Keep them coming."
2,repetitive and boring,"While it is, of course, fine for children's books to be silly and even repetitive, there are lots of other titles which do with much less monotony. It is very difficult to read this with any sense of fun, flow or rhythm. Hopefully, this won't be a title your child asks you to read over and over. While this book may be fun for a lot of children (my daughter not so much), it is not very fun for the parent."
2,not much to say about it,the only thing i can say that is good about this book is the graphics.... there are much better hard page books out for little hands. the repetition in the book is booooorrriiiinnngggggg. i think the writer had not much to say so he added repeating lines. all i can say is yiyekers...
3,cute but repetitive,"My babies love the googly frog eyes and the pictures are cute, but the verses are repetitive...and get annoying very quickly. I think for older kids, it might be a fun book to help them learn to read because they'll recognize the same words again and again. But mommies reading to babies want something a little more fun to read! 1 star for the verse, 3 stars for the illustrations/eyes."
5,Frog and kitchen sink,This is a Great book. It can be read several different ways substituting names and places of where a frog should never be put. It is a favorite of many ages.
1,THIS IS JUST MISSING IT'S BOX!,"I can't believe that I was fooled into buying this set, thinking that it really was a ""Limited Edition"" set as advertised in it's Amazon.com title. When I recieved my set, I knew immediately that it was just the book & discs of the regular USA release. It originally came with a Blinking Light box, which is not included here."
2,Not the same scent it used to be!,"Could it be old? It has a dusty smell, not fresh at all! I think the bottle must have been sitting around for years."
1,Not Really Royal Copenhagen,I've been using Royal Copenhagen for the past 40 years and this is absolutely NOT Royal Copenhagen. The smell is similar when smelling it in the bottle but remarkably different when applied. It has a muskier smell and is nowhere near as pleasing is REAL Royal Copenhagen. This knock-off is going down the drain because neither my wife nor I can tolerate the smell. What a waste!
1,Not good,This smell is not good. The package was terrible. Leaked all over during shipping and due to Amazon's return policy. You cannot send it back. That's what you get for ordering cologne over the internet.
5,Great deal,"My husband was very pleased with his gift. And I was VERY pleased with the price, almost 85% off store prices!"
1,Do not Order this Cologne,Got this Cologne yesterday and opened it was not what I ordered at all. I have been using Royal Copenhagen for over 30 years now and have never had a problem like this. Something is really wrong either its old or something. The smell/odor is not the same. Love this Cologne and now I am stuck with an 8 oz. bottom of crap that will be going down the toilet.
2,"Lo siento ricky, no eres tan bueno como piensas","Lo siento por ricky y sus fans, es un buen showman, pero es un pesimo cantante."
3,Decent live album,"This is a decent live album with a good selection of songs. My only real comment is that after opening this one-disk album I discover the CD says ""Spear of Destiny Disk 2"", the track listing was correct but the ""Disk 2"" was perplexing. Obviously some reissue/repackaging was going on. Doing some research, I discovered the CD was originally from the 2CD/1DVD set ""In Concert/Do You Believe in the Westworld"". Its the best CD from that set (includes Dreamtime, Westworld, Liberator) however for a few extra dollars you might want to track down the other album and get the extra disks."
3,Great Sounding Sacred Cow--Plenty Wrong Here,"This review is of the 25th anniversary blu ray version. The music and the performers' stage presence are terrific. The problems start with the source video that should have received considerably more restoration. The bad lip sync in one song is even more distracting/disturbing. It doesn't help that in the bonus feature interview David Byrne says that an overdub changed the words that he spoke live between songs. It makes you wonder how much of the entire performance was overdubbed.Great music. But the ""Greatest concert movie ever"" seems like just another concert film that was ""sweetened"" for mass consumption."
3,A little too small and flimsy,"I got this set since it was cheap and seemed versatile. I ended up buying the nicer ones later. These work ok for real small stuff, but not moving chunks of live rock or even corals. I would say just for frags. Even the grabbing handle is somewhat awkward. I prefer the better ones with a squeeze handle and more like suction cup looking ends on pinchers."
3,half-way works...,"Purchased this more for fun rather than anything else, wasn't expecting much from it, but at the same time though it would be a nice tool to keep me from having to immerse my entire hand in the tank when I wanted to adjust one thing. First of, the scissor tool is worthless, I attempted to trim some of my underwater plants and the scissor jammed instantly. The pincer works pretty well for picking up smaller objects, as well as grabbing plants to bring to the surface."
3,"2 1/2 Stars, Actually","It is heartening to see that this book is NOT subject to the ""star inflation"" that plagues much of this website! [I mean, do you really think a majority of books should receive 4 or 5 stars!]. ""The Education of John Dewey"" is a solid biography of an interesting man who played an important role in American intellectual history. However, the book just didn't grab me. Not like ""Lincoln's Virtues: an Ethical Biography"" for example. One note about Dewey's philosophy. I don't see what was so new about pragmatism/naturalism/progressivism or whatever you want to call it. Wasn't Dewey's emphasis on the importance of the continuing pursuit of truth just a modern version of the Socratic method????????"
4,Acting Like I Quit,"Great indie pop! As an American abroad, their line ""Everybody thinks I voted for George Bush"" is pretty poignant, to me in Seoul anyway. I think the band sounds a lot like Joe Jackson's band in the early 80s. Very Brit. Thanks to Rich Mars at MSOE's WMSE Monday morning show for tuning me in to this one. Check out his show!"
5,OTC Wine Crackers,"These crackers are delicious with wine, cheese or fruit, all by themselves, or with your favorite cup of tea. I first had them at a winery in the finger lakes in New York State several years ago. I like to give them with bottles of wine as gifts to family and friends."
5,That perfect little something extra,"I discovered these at a local winery and fell in love! They remind me a little of animal crackers in taste, but are heartier, with a big crunch. They are the perfect addition to a tasting to clean the palate, or just a nice side for an evening glass of wine. Love these things!"
3,wine crackers,Really enjoy these wine crackers and have difficulty finding them unless I happen to be at a winery. So........I am delighted to be able to purchase them by the case and have them shipped. Shipping costs are a bit prohibitive but that is part of the pricing.Thank you Cathy Salkeld
3,Too much flavor for a wine cracker,"Although these have great flavor - hint of vanilla & lemon, they are really not suited for wine tasting since a cracker should cleanse the palate. Probably too sweet. We've had mixed comments."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Corridors of Time is a different story. The world has two opposing political powers, and part of this struggle ends up taking place in the timestream. No Everard Manse here.A lot of it in this case, in ancient Denmark. So, quite enjoyable to see a different setting handled in this way compared to the usual sort of places."
5,This book changed my life.,"My mother bought this book at an auction for a few dollars about 20 years ago. I happened to stumble across it in a pile of other books at home when I was 14. I couldn't put it down. For me, this book was magical and truly enlightening for my young mind at the time. I can't believe it's so difficult to find."
4,Very good reading!,"This is the story of José Gaspar from his early childhood on the banks of the Guadalquivir River in Spain, to his last moments of life near Florida. The reader follows the observant lad through the Naval Academy, his leadership times, and his pirate career. The reader witnesses his true love, Dona Rosalita Santiago, and rejoices with them. Then witnesses his overwhelming tragedies.I often found myself highlighting areas of interest and jotting down notes of wisdom, like the art of foot massage. I found the hero, José Gaspar, to be too pure of mind often, but the life he led was too fascinating to enable me to put down the book.I believe this book to be a must to those who reside in Florida of The United States of America or anywhere in Spain, as well as, all who have interest in the history of pirates. Very interesting reading between these pages!"
3,"Great story, choppy writing.","Though a great, romantic story of life in the Florida Gulf during the creation of America, the writing is as choppy as the waters of the Gulf Stream during Hurricane season. The reading will flow from time to time, only to be tossed about like a shrimp trauler on stormy seas. A tiresome read, though the well thought out story line will keep you going."
1,Gasparilla: Prose as a Lethal Weapon,"Poor old Jose Gaspar. He probably never dreamed his life story would be written in such a dreadfully dull and boring fashion. He would have come out of his watery grave and sliced up this author's ancestors, had he known. The large number of errors and stupefying prose eventually tips off the reader that this book is of the vanity press variety, and with good reason. Don't encourage this author.....he might be persuaded to write again."
1,"Gasparilla, the awful","God awful.The references to God, the Church, and Jesus in the book are just part of the story.Many of the historical reflections are not of the time or inaccurately cast. None of the historical facts are backed up by references.Gasparilla's character, the only one attempted, is poorly developed.The sex makes no sense and adds nothing to the story. The ""true"" love is not sensuous and the ""lustful"" love is crude and not explained. The way I see it, the author has his mind on breasts and not on story telling.In general, the story is a drudgery.I read this book because I am in a book club that my wife started.I believe the underlying story has merit. It just needs to be repaired. Hope this helps. Good luck."
1,Read Thomas Ashley-Farrand Instead,"Good gief; she writes a million books on Feng Shui, and then switches to hindu mantras? Read Sanskrit mantra expert Thomas Ashley-Farrand's excellent books (Healing Mantras, Shakti Mantras and lots of Sounds True tapes) instead for the real thing."
4,Wish I could wear it,"This ring is pretty but the sizing doesn't run true to size due to the bulk caused from the intertwined bands. I'm not sure if a half size larger would even fit. I ordered this ring and a simple band at the same time in the same size I normally wear and the simple band fits perfectly. This ring however doesn't even come close to fitting over my knuckle. It's very pretty and I wish I could wear it, I may even reorder a larger size."
4,Wholemovement puts a new dimension on Geometry,"This book presents a new way of modeling geometric forms. The idea of using paper plates to form the Origami-like 3-d models is unique! ""Children"" of all ages will enjoy creating these spatial phenomena. Very Clever."
3,For dancin' with my mirror (literally),"I'm not sure why this 2002 compilation of Corey Hart exists because 11 of the 12 tracks here are available on the much better 15 track compilation, 1992's ""The Singles"". The only song special on Classic Masters is ""Dancin' with my mirror"" from his '86 album ""Fields of Fire"". Don't get me wrong, the music is great, but another compilation was unecessary. My advice: skip Classic Masters as well as 1998's Best of Corey Hart (from the 10 best series) and just get ""The Singles"". Unless you have to have ""dancin' with my mirror"" of course. Then you have a problem."
4,Corey Hart classics NEVER sounded better,It seems that hits collections draw consistent criticism for not including some tracks and for including others .... regardless if one feels this compilation is complete or not one thing stands quite true ...Corey Hart classic songs have NEVER sounded better on this particular remastered release. Classic Masters CD release brings absolute new life to Corey's 80s/90s work. I have his Hits collection and it sounds very muffled and weak ... this hits CD sounds as if the songs were just recorded this year .... awesome and highly recommended if you want some of the best of Corey Hart but more importantly with awesome remastered sound quality.
4,Excellent,"You never hear about this band among 1960s pop vocal bands, and that's just a cryi........ok, I won't.But unlike the 5D or to a much greater extent the Letterman, these guys were actually playing rock and roll. Most of Sugar and Spice is covers: the Beatles ""I Needed Someone,"" and the Animals ""We Gotta Get Out Of This Place.""The Cryin Shames popified this music, and that is a lot different than prettying it. The vocals are the most layered, and the music is jangle pop, and it has a fun jaunt to it, driven by open guitar and never falling into sap.You know you are not listening to Hendrix, but for what this is, it is the best of the sound"
5,I'm so glad I read this!,"A revealing look at the inner workings of the militant and violent ""prolife"" cult in America today."
5,The truth about the pro-lifers!,"At last! The true story! I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone who wants to know the truth about antiabortion activists and the terror they inflict on anyone who disagrees with them.Having been a victim of these people, I know that what Ms. Windle and Ms. Bader write is accurate.All Americans should read this book!"
3,How does one get 5 rings?,It seems like every set available is 3. These look nice and I'd buy 5 individually if they weren't so expensive. Any deal possible? I know this should be a message to the seller but that doesn't seem possible. Anyone know of a decent 5-ring set I could grab?
5,Using as backup,"I've been using the Drive for about a month, mostly as a back up, but also to coordinate between home/work computers. Working exactly as I hoped."
3,Nashville Songwriters Association VHS,"This is a curious product.I'm not sure how ,or to whom,it was distributed.Historically fascinating,there are clips on here that don't exist anywhere else.Should be interesting even to those who don't write songs,though a little long."
5,Well Made Signs,"I was very happy with these signs and would recommend them to anyone. They are constructed like regular street signs- very durable, and I expect they will last a very long time. These are great signs for someone who owns guinea birds, as they tend to escape and like to play on the road and in ditches. Put a few of these signs up for traffic on both sides of your road to warn motorists- it may help you, and motorists, avoid tragedies."
3,Cool Fan,"Fan looks very nice in my living room and was easy to install. Only drawback is that the chain that controls the speed should have been designed for a smoother operation. Not bad if you set it at one speed and don't plan on changing, otherwise you need to get a small ladder in order to pull the chain without it binding."
4,"Glass is stunning, but product info is incomplete.","Perhaps a naive mistake on my part, but the product info did not indicate that this is just 1 glass. I thought for $20, I may get 4 of these. Well I did not mean to spend $20 for 1 glass.Glass looks stunning and yes it is crystal."
4,UY!,I bought this on ebay just because it was a Mario Bava film. I'd heard about it before but when I watched it I was very impressed. This has got some of the best surrealistic photography I've ever seen..(the floating blade scene). The story's been done before but the kid in the film was pretty darn creepy! And watch out for that one scene with him! You've been warned - - you'll jump 5 feet out of your seat! THAT alone was worth the price I paid for it!
4,Still creeps me out,I hadn't seen this since I was about 6 or 7 years old at the drive in. I never could remember the name of the movie but always remembered scenes from it. I finally found the name and quickly bought this dvd. I thought surely it wouldn't be nearly as creepy as I remembered. So I started watching it last night (Halloween) and I am happy to say it was still pretty darn creepy. That kids face gives me the willies sometimes. This is not a gory slasher movie so if that's your cup of tea look elsewhere. This is a psychological horror/thriller/mystery.
1,Shock,"Can Italians Make any Decent Film? Europeans Period? Shock is the typical Eurotrash film minus the gore, there is Hints of Emotional Incest of a sort,bad acting and obvious story. Among other loopholes why would anyone move back to a house where something bad happen? Makes no Sense at all, the music is worth it but it certainly has no redeemable qualities or charm. A true Snorefest which is a shock considering How Over the Top Euro Horror Movies usually tend to go."
1,The worst child actor of all time,"Mario Bava's ""Shock"" certainly has a few jump-out-of-your-seat moments, but it also has one lethal flaw: the little boy at the center of the movie's plot is unbearably annoying. Perhaps the fault lies in whoever did the English dubbing, but I wanted to slap the TV screen every time the kid opened his mouth. He makes Dondi look like Olivier's Hamlet."
3,bueno pero sin punto...POINTLESS BUT NICE,"I WATCHED THIS MOVIE EXPECTING A WELL TOLD TALE AND GOT A WEAKLY STRUCTURED CINEMATIC DISAPPOINTMENT. I COULD NOT STRETCH MY MIND TO BELIEVE THAT THE MILITARY WOULD LET A CAPTAIN BECOME A ""PIMP"" TO BOOST MORALE AMONG THE TROOPS. IT WAS TOO FAR FETCHED. THEN THE CHANCES OF HIM BEING REALLY REALLY HANDSOME DEDICATED TO SERVICE AND MARRIED TO A REALLY PRETTY WOMAN AND THE ONE ""MISUNDERSTOOD"" HOOKER. ""LA COLUMBIANA"" BEING REALLY REALLY HOT LOOKING AND NOT ENDING UP IN BED WAS RIDICULOUS. OF COURSE THEY ""GOT IT ON"". WHO COULDNT SEE THAT COMMING? THAT WAS THE POINT. ""LETS BUILD A MOVIE AROUND TWO MORE HOLLYWOOD GOOD LOOKING PEOPLE GETTING TOGETHER"". THE ONE GOOD REASON TO GET THIS MOVIE IS THE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS WOMEN THAT SHOW US THEIR ""GOOD'S"". THAT ALONE MADE IT WORTH EVERY PENNY. IT'S DECIDED. LATIN WOMEN ARE THE MOST GORGEOUS. THIS MOVIE JUST PROVES IT BEYOND ARGUMENT. STORY,POOR. WOMEN 2 THUMBS UP!"
1,A sad portrait of society,"Basically this movie tells us a history of a married Peruvian soldier who was given the mission of establishing a brothel for soldier serving on isolated posts at the skirts of the Amazon jungle. And this all had to be done because the poor lonely soldier were so desperate for sex that they were raping local women. I cannot understand how this deplorable plot can be considered as funny. I just cannot understand how rape and prostitution can possible be used as a means of comedy. For me this is all just too sad. It is too sad to see that women exploitation is still seen so lightly and worst of all, as superb, hilarious and uplifting."
1,The humor escapes me,"I found this movie to be a miserable, predictable, and pointless experience. The political satire of it escapes me as well as the humor or sexiness. If you want a real satire about military life and corruption, see ""Bananas!"" And if you want to entertain some goofy fantasy about running a legal prostitute ring and cheating on your wife, then see this."
2,"Lots of froth, little substance","Once again, I've fallen for the old ""froth & bubble"". This book is far too short to give you a sustantial insight into how these processes work - and how to practically apply them. In my opinion it is far too brief and too general. It seems that it may be more useful for students of the subject who need a ""quick reference"" book.Apart from these quibbles it is well written."
2,Superficial treatment of NLP concepts !,"This book is fine for those who want to get an overview of some of the NLP concepts quickly. Serious readers of NLP will find this superficial. If you really want to learn NLP and apply it in your day to day life, you will be better off reading other NLP books which explain these much more in depth."
1,Disappointing at First Now a 4 STAR,"The Ez Vinyl software lacks clear instructions, especially computer settings. I have tried it now for the last several hours and everything I import is very bad.I have an email in to tech support...no phone support. (bad)Hopefully it will be my operator error, if so I will write another review. If tech support cant handle the problem I will returnUPDATE..4STARShad connected USB thru router which was causing problems, also changed sound pref inputs to USB Codec.Works Great now...."
4,ION USB Turntable,For the price this does a very good job. You can't manipulate the quality of the sound but if you just want to copy old records this is perfect.
1,"A toy, plain and simple.","Don't waste your money, this is nothing more than a toy.Very poorly made, buggy software and horrible sound quality. The stylus is horrible.Plus, it forces you to use iTunes, there is no useful way to edit tracks, and the sound quality is unacceptable.It might be ok for someone with no concept of audio quality, which would explain the 4 and 5 start ratings.If you want to archive your vinyl, just buy a USB Phono Preamp here on Amazon, and plug your turntable into it. There are hundreds of used tables for sale on the 'net. Then you get a real turntable, an excellent converter with analog and digital outputs for slightly more money than this child's toy. And that gives you the ability to edit and/or clean up your vinyl recordings with something like Cool Edit, Audacity or some other freeware/open source audio editing software."
1,Junk,"The concept here is great(record records to your computer), but the quality is terrible. The unit is cheap plastic, and feels like a child's toy. The electronics produce a background buzz, no matter how its hooked up, even if the only connection to it is a pair of headphones (sometimes a bad ground does this, but not the case here). The spindle is too small, so that it doesn't fill the hole in the record, meaning you have to manually center the record on the turntable, or it wobbles. There's no auto return, or even a little handle on the head with which to smoothly lift the needle off the record, making it easy to scratch your record. The needle simply bounces off the end of the record.If you can get one that doesn't buzz, you could use it to record your records to your hard drive. Just be careful to line up the record perfectly on the platter, since the spindle isn't a good guide, and be ready at the end of the record to smoothly lift the needle before it hits the center label."
4,Piece of cake!!!,"This item could not be easier to use! My 53-year-old computer illiterate father fully comprehended this item and was able to install it, run it, and transfer it to his iTunes and iPod VERY easily! The only problem I see in this item is that it seems a little cheaply manufactured; however, it is well worth its price!"
4,ION USB Turntable,"I bought this turntable for the specific purpose of transferring my vinyl recordings to CD - and I am not disappointed. This item is easy to set up and easy to use. I would not recommend it for stand-alone listening, but for this purpose it fills the bill. The instructions are brief and easy to follow."
1,did not receive right item,They substituted for another turntable. It was a gift for my husband. He hated it! Tried to return but too much trouble. Also costs too much to send back. Won't make that mistake again.
1,A terrible waste of money,"Save yourself some anguish and avoid buying this. Ours never worked from day one. Thinking we had not hooked up something, we asked a techie friend for help. He concluded the problem was in the turntable. We had thrown away the box so we learned an expensive lesson NEVER to buy electronics on the Internet--unless you are an electronics repairman."
1,Mine didn't work,"I had to return the unit I purchased because it didn't work. I installed the software that came with it and connected the hardware according to the instructions. I could hear the music coming out of the unit's speaker. I could hear the music coming out of my computer speakers. The unit would create a file on my hard drive and upload it to iTunes. The file would be silence. I tried playing it in iTunes and in QuickTime. Nothing but silence. I brought the file into an editing program and the waveform was a flat nothing from start to finish. I tried the process multiple times, but always got the same result. It did everything it was supposed to do except actually record audio. Weird."
3,Really quiet speaker - not really compatible with macs,"I got this hoping to transfer some of my LPs to my macbook. The software isn't easily usable with a mac, I ended up having to use my desktop PC to transfer LPs to MP3s, and the quality was average. I also hoped to use this as a record player, but the speakers were very quiet, I ended up plugging other speakers into it to improve sound. I really appreciated its size, very compact and easily moveable, but definitely not the best product out there for someone looking to transfer high quality music."
4,Great Christmas gift,My son is not of the general who grew up with turntables; he really enjoyed the novelty of this item. He started collecting vintage Led Zepplin albums. This was his first opportunity to listen to these albums. The digital aspect of it allowed him to connect to his XBox or laptop.
4,Great Deal,Great deal for the price of a traditional turntable. Portability is a bonus. Sound quality as good as a small speaker gets but not stereo. Can be hooked up to stereo system but I like it just the way it is. Comes with a power plug and a long USB wire connector. Turntable starts to turn when you put a record on it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to anyone with old LPs who wants to hear original sound quality in a light compact portable unit.
2,Save your money and time!,"My husband bought this hoping to put LP collection on iPod. It does the job, but the sound quality is horrible. Recording is very low. He spent a lot of time with this only to resort to iTunes for better sounding downloads."
3,Great step by step pictures,"This manual covers over 50 rifles and includes variation for simular rifles . It does not have exploded parts views or part numbers . For this you are going to need the factory manual . The step by step pictures are accompied with instructions . This book shows the various steps of disassembly in order . It is a great help getting a firearm apart , but sometimes fails to mention that some parts could be assembled backwards and fails to show the part as should be . Overall this book will help you disassemble a firearm , and reassemble it !"
3,Good for those who are just amatures or like saving cash,A good book that covers mostly obscure/ rare shotguns that have discontinued production. The steps are simple to follow and any trouble that you may encounter will be smoothened out. Excellent for those just starting out but lack of variety of guns and was published in '92 means this book has missed some important new firearms developements.
1,Should be obscure firearms assembly/disassembly,"I bought the book with the hope that it would tell me how to re-assemble a Remington Model 12 pump action rifle. Unfortunately, the book didn't have the Model 12 (although it's got a Kintrek KBP-1, Mauser DSM, and other exotica). There IS a disassembly/assembly procedure for the Remington Model 121, but it is so obscure that it did absolutely no good, even though the models are very similar. One crucial picture shows the cartridge guide, but the picture is composed such that the reader has NO idea how the cartridge guide should be oriented.All-in-all, a waste of money and time."
4,Good Reading - for basics,"This is an good book for centerfire basics on specific rifles. If you are looking for the downside, the only one I can find is that Gun Digest needs to do an update on their manuals. I would like to see something in addition to this covering more up to date rifles. All in all very positive."
1,Short on power,I am not satisfied with the performance of the Makita battery I bought.The battery I originally had would not take a charge. This battery takes a charge but does not last long enough to finish even a small job. I have owned cordless drills in the past and their batteries lasted a lot longer.
2,"cutesy,not practical","This item is cute,but not rugged or tough enough to withstand the constantgnawing of canine teeth.And my dog's a chihuahua!"
5,An interactive toy - not a chew toy!,"My Maltese, Pomeranian, and even 45 pound Brittany LOVE this toy and every other toy in this line. They're meant to be interactive and not chew toys. For a chew toy try a kong or other rubber toy."
2,Gypo Ripoff,I ordered 2 9.6 volt 2.6 amp hr NIMH batteries but I recieved 2 2.6 amp hr NICAD batteries. These batteries are orange not black like the ones in the add.
5,When is the new edition coming out......,There is no better guide for knowing the ins and outs of wineries throughout California. Large and small wineries they are all there. Forget some of the reviews. The background of each winery is great reading...
4,Smooth and Relaxing,"This CD is a smooth mixture of harp, keyboards, flute and sax. There are 3 songs - A Puro Dolor, Gina, and Susurro De Olas that I listen to over and over again. I especially like where Ed Calle plays sax on Gina and Susurro De Olas. There are other good songs, but these 3 are my favorites."
1,disappointed,"I found this book to have subjective opinions that varied too much from my own and my colleagues' experiences at work. The premise of the book was good, but it was not well-researched enough for me to use it as a resource for business etiquette. Also, I felt that the author's advocation of pranks and rudeness was a bit out of place in an etiquette book."
5,excellent read,"Love this book--- love this book!!!! A ""good book for keeping"" to add to one's collection!!! Well thought out plot, good details & it's Andre Norton!!! Nothing else need be said!"
5,Makita ML121 Flashlight.,I wish to learn if this product comes with a battery and charger or do I have to purchase these items separately?
4,Awesome kung fu display!,"The movie was Billy Chong's best movie. The guy has moves and speed. The only thing that gets lost in this movie is his arranged marriage. Otherwise, this is a movie for all kung fu enthusists!"
2,Most shrimp did not make it out of the unit.,"Good idea, but I tried it on fresh and salt setups and most of the shrimp stayed in the guts of the unit bouncing around in the bubbles."
1,Maybe I'm doing something wrong but...,"I followed the directions, filled it with salt water that I have already mixed, turned on the air pump, which is the smallest one I could find (up to 25 gallons) and thought: that's way too strong an air flow, it'll kill any brine shrimp, plus the sound is irritating. So I turned off the pump for a moment and noticed that the salt water is coming into my fresh water tank. Then the suction cup let loose and the whole thing tipped over. So much for that. I took it out of the tank and not sure what to do now as I'm leaving town for a week and have no one to feed my bumblee goby. Really irritating."
5,amazing book,"From the moment I started reading this book, i was truly intrigued. The book had a way of getting me hooked and sucked in right there with Annabelle and her family. I recommend this book to everyone. Great job Marcia Mayo!"
3,Not as pictured,"I wouldn't have gotten this part if it was correctly pictured. I have a space limitation, and this isn't the minimal type of fitting. There is about 1/2"" of blank tubing between the nut part of the fitting and the beginning of the threads on the schrader valve end. In other words, the skinny part is more than twice as long as shown. Overall length of the part in the picture will be just under an inch, what I got is 1.75 inches long. Long enough I can't use it. If you have plenty of space this is a good normal shrader valve, and they sent them with the nice metal caps with the core removing end. Lack of attention to detail on their part has cost me some money and them a customer. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.<ADDED Jan 16, 2011> Browsing through my reviews, I noticed that they changed the picture. Now it's a drawing, and it's correct. Good job, wish they had done that prior to my purchase, but better late than never. 8^)"
5,Incorrect word in title...this is not a toy but a book,This paperback listing has the word (toy) in brackets after the title....Alternatives to Worksheets. This is misleading because this is a book not a toy...hopefully Amazon will change the toy wording.
5,Works great,I live in a 3 story condo and I was having problems with my wi-fi.Problem fixed and my wi-fi is even faster now.It's not as big as people say it is.
2,Didn't help,"My office is about 60 feet from the wireless router, and my signal was between 1 and 2 bars (of 5). I bought this antenna to boost the signal strength, and while it did, it is now between 2 and 3 bars.My apple Mac-mini gets 5 bars, as does my Linux based netbook.Delivery was on time, and it was what I ordered... of sorts."
1,The Worst,"I've read quiet a few Doctor Who novels but this one has been the worst. I only finished the book out of loyalty to the series. The author takes the approach of little to no action, and goes way in depth at describing the characters feelings during different situations. This wouldn't of been that bad except for the fact I felt he got the characters all wrong. The way he described the characters is not how I remember them from watching the TV show. Again, not only was the book not accurate in portraying the characters, it was boring, and I literally had to force myself to finish reading it. One final warning for this book, it is by far the darkest and most adult Dr. Who book I have read to date. The ending is also not happy, in the fact that Dodo does something so insanely stupid & out of character that it kind of just ruins the story. In fact Dodo was nothing like she was in the TV series. But everyone has their own opinion, & mine happens to be a bit harsh because I didn't like the story."
2,Hate to be a downer,"This is the only Who book I've read that I hated. I just can't reconcile the tone with the First Doctor era. Having said that, I do plan on reading it again. It's just incredibly unpleasant. Dodo is not a great companion, to say the least. I will say that the writing itself is more than passable and effective. To me, it was like watching an episode that even though you hate it, you can't help but admit to yourself that it's well done. Just made me want to take a shower while I was reading it. Yuck. Before anyone says so, I suppose I shouldn't criticize until I've written a novel. True. This review is just from a fan."
2,Nice non-stick but does not last,"PROS:-Non-stick works really well; there is hardly any sauce left in the pot/pan after you simply pour it out.-The handles do not get hot.-Lids fit well and are very high-quality.CONS:-Scratches easily.-The bottom of the pots and pans are ribbed and hard to clean.-We used the pans on a gas stove, and the non-stick wore off in approximately a year (not due to scratches but probably due to the heat). We are looking for a new set of longer-lasting cookware."
5,Farberware Enhanced 10 Piece Cookware,"I am so pleased with the product. I have been a Farberware user for 40 years and my new set is even better than I had expected, and I expected a lot. It is sturdy, easy to clean, heats evenly and is attractive. The price was very fair."
3,"Excellent quality, clear lids, rubber handles, wash up easily, only bad thing is the lids are not an air tight fit.","Excellent quality, clear lids, rubber handles, wash up easily, only bad thing is the lids are not an air tight fit."
5,Best investment ever,I bought this from Jcpenny I believe about 5 years ago. Cooks evenly. No rusting. Still non stick. A breeze to clean. I love these pots!!Considering I got them on sale at the time for 50$ Id say I got my moneys worth!!!
2,Farberware cookware.,The quality of this set of cookware did not match the reputation of Farberware. Lids do not fit the skillets well(large and small) and when heated the bottom of the large skillet becomes slightly rounded. Bad!
2,Farberware Enhanced 10-Piece Nonstick Cookware Set,"Freeware Enhanced 10-Piece Nonstick Cookware Set looks good, easy handling.But Nonstick Coating layer coming out. I don't no y it is?"
1,Worst non-stick I've ever bought,"I bought this based on saucepan design (see below) and the satisfied reviews. I'm shocked at the poor quality and terrible non-stick interiors. I've bought various brands of non-stick cookware for years, but this is hands-down the worst. Scrambled eggs and omelets were a disaster the very first time. Pan/pot weight is extremely light compared to other brands such as Revere, Cook's, T-Fal. The lids are the heaviest and sturdiest thing about them.I really dislike the current trend of making small diameter, narrow, taller pots for the 2-1/2 qt to 4 qt sizes. I like the height/width of these saucepans, but nothing else about them justifies a purchase."
5,Really good tape!,Have the first workout tape and love it. Can work through the entire tape even at the end of the longest day and not feel I am forcing myself to do it. This is a first.
1,Conflicting directions,"The on line directions for this eye compress say to chill or microwave it. If you buy it, as I did, because an ophthmologist recommended warm compresses you will be disappointed. The directions that come with it say never to put it in a microwave and that advice is printed right on the compress.Fire & Ice Eye Lid Compress - 1 - Pack"
5,"Functional, good for classroom and student use","I purchased 8 of these portable CD players to hold books on CD and portable CD players for my students' use. It is big enough in the front to hold the CD player, headphones, and a ziplock baggie of alcohol wipes. The interior part can easily hold 3 novels' worth of books on CD that correspond to our curriculum. This makes it easy for students to check out the whole CD player pack to listen to in the classroom, OR to check it out and easily take it home. I feel good knowing that my out-of-pocket investment of the CD players is protected - that even if the case is dropped, everything inside should be OK."
2,Shallow End,"After reading the very engaging Accidental Bestseller by Ms. Wax I was excited to try another of her books. I got about half way through 7 Days and just could not go on with it. The plot and characters are very shallow, and too much time is spent on the supposed sexual tension building between the two lrad characters. In fact, it seemed that this tension was the main story line. Ms Wax has shown that she has far more talent than displayed here."
5,A terrific debut,"Even after being saturated by reality television--this story about two antagonistic former lovers, who are competing to keep their own vastly different radio programs on the air, is a winner. They reluctantly agree to live together for one week while being tele-cast on the Internet so viewers vote for their favorite celebrity; the winner keeps their show. Wendy Wax keeps her characters interesting because she has the courage to make them not quite perfect, but still endearing. The sub-plots are well developed and provide a nice thread to the story. I wish that I could as enthusastically recommend the books that followed 7 Days and 7 Nights, but my slight disappointment won't keep me from reading more books by Wendy Wax."
4,"Good sound, a bit uncomfortable","I've owned these for about 3 years. They're pretty good buds. The thing that I'm most impressed with is the fact that unlike all of my other buds, both sides of these still work, and they work equally at that! The sound quality is pretty good, considering they're buds. These can handle most, but not all of the higher frequencies. You also get decent enough bass. The winding case definitely comes in handy. It gives me an easy and safe way to store my earbuds and not lose them. My only qualm with these headphones is that they start to hurt your ears after about 45 minutes of usage, which sucks if you're exercising or doing anything of the like. Then again, I could just have weird ears???Either way, for under $10, this is a great deal for on-the-go earbuds. Get them even if you don't need them...I'm sure they'll come in handy."
2,junk,i guess the sound is fine...but they are not comfortable and the CASE IS JUNK. it simply fell apart when i opened it and is made of really cheap plastic. avoid this.
2,Ouch!,"I wanted earphones that had some sort of storage device with it because I was getting tired of untangling my earphones and those little 'earphone bones' kept getting lost. The storage is o.k., but not really what I was looking for (still in search of the perfect storage), but the earphones themselves are very disappointing.I read a review that said that the ear pieces were too big and painful. I should have taken that review more seriously. The sound quality is o.k., but I can't really use the earphones for any length of time before they start hurting my ear. I only use them as an emergency spare pair."
4,sounds great,Not much to say here. These ear buds sounds great for ear buds. I would recommend them.
2,Too Big,I got these @ Target for a very cheep price and really like the case. Keeps the wires neat in my purse so I could listen to my MP3 player anywhere. The sound quality was good for cheep ear buds. The only problem it that dont stay in my ears cuz thay are way too big for ear buds. They are alway falling out of my ears and it drives me crazy.
4,great cheapo earphones,"They sound fine and are as comfortable as any earbuds I have used. I needed cheapo earbuds for the kids, when they became audiopholes and would no longer use the free airline earphones I kept giving them (I hate it when they catch on to stuff like that). I bought several pairs of these, in anticipation of multiple losses, but surprisingly they have kept up with their original sets and are happy with the sound. I still miss giving them the freebie airline sets though. Oh, and don't tell them that you bought multiple pairs of earbuds for them or they WILL lose a set a week!"
5,Works as Advertised,Bought this for my Sansa player and it works great! Product arrived in a timely fashion.
3,Clear sound but not so good as older one,"I have read most reviews from this site and bought it.Most people say that it is good buy for its cheap price.Right! It is still cheap. When I bought my old Fontopia in 1992, it was $10 or so (it was made in Japan, though). This one is still $10 in 2007, which actually means the price got down.Overall, for its price it provides very clear and sharp sound, but the bass is not so good as my 1992 version, which is disappointing.One last thing that forced me to return this is its inconsistent assembly.I received a defective one with louder left channel. I know it is not general problem of this product, but the product quality should be consistent for all individual items."
4,Solid Quality for a Nice Price,"Easy. Comfortable. Nice Sound. Nothing Spectacular, but it's a solid brand and product for the amazingly cheap price.Wind up case is a nice bonus, it keeps the cords from getting tangled which eventually alters the sound quality by only coming out of one ear bud (We all know that annoying happenstance). Very easy to wind as well."
3,"not what i was expecting, but still useful","I was expecting something smaller. The case was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The cable is shorter than is usual for headphones. However, the sound quality is great for the price and the case has served its purpose and has enabled these head phones to last more than three months, which is a way above average in my experience. I would like to see more earbud manufactures include a similar case."
5,Great earbuds !,I tested out a bunch of ear buds for our Assistive Listening Device receivers at our church before ordering a large quantity. In my opinion these little Sony ear buds give the best overall fidelity and bass response for your dollar. I now use these on all of my personal MP3 players here too. You could pay a lot more and not be any more pleased with your listening experience than with the Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia product.
2,I'm goging back to my iPod earbuds,"These earbuds are probably fine for some people, but I just can't do it anymore. The sound is marginally better than the earbuds that came with my 30G iPod, but they are just too uncomfortable. I am a big wuss when it comes to comfort, but I guess I shouldn't have expected much for $[...]. And they also made this wierd popping sound when I walk with them sometimes and have a hiss when the volume is low. If you're not worried about comfort as much and just want some cheap earbuds, these will probably be fine. If you're like me and prefer comfort, look elsewhere."
2,Your money is probably better spent on a different set of earphones,"The following reasons together make these earphones unusable for me. If you have similar preferences,1) The cord is too short. There isn't enough length or slack for me to have my device below the belt while being able to move my head around. There are plenty of alternatives that either have a longer cord, or have a short cord (for when your device is on your arm) with an included extension cable.2) The earbuds are too big. I may not have big ears, but they're not small either. I've been through several earphones, and none have been as uncomfortable as these.3) The cord going to each ear is the same length. I like having the main cord on one side, and then a split at about neck-level to the other ear."
3,Good for travel but case doesn't stay closed,"... and the earbuds hurt my ears after a while. It could have been better designed to reel out/reel in the wire, but probably not for the price. It's OK."
2,Not worth the money,Try the Jbuds version of this.The retractable gimmick is better on paper than in use.
3,earbuds too big for my ear :((,"The one thing that I didn't like right from the beginning is that the earbuds are REALLY BIG. It is hard to fit them in my ear, and my ear hurts when/after I use them. However, the sound quality is very good! Well at least compared to my laptop. I am hearing sounds I didn't know were there before. The music sounds so much richer and nice, and the bass sounds good too! Also, the price is really good! especially now that i know they sound so good. I just bought these because I was trying to find cheap earphones, I didn't wanna spend more then 10 bucks on earphones. But, they hurt my ear, so I am trying to see if I can find another earphone that has smaller earbuds, but hopefully has similar sound quality..."
3,kinda disappointed,"the buds are quite large. havent even been wearing them for an hour, and my ears hurt.if you turn it up too much, the bass rattles.the chord is kind of short."
4,"good case, cheap ear buds","This case is really nice to have, i love that my ear-buds are always ready for me to use and not tangled together in a mess. The ear-buds that came with this case seemed a little on the large size so I am not using them (other pairs fit just fine). The case is nice to keep the ear buds from being tangled but seems like it could break easily. Overall great for me. since I just wanted to keep my ear-buds from getting tangled."
5,As good and better than other more expensive earbuds,"These are much better than a $30 pair of Maxell earbuds I picked up at Newbury Comics recently. I highly recommend these for anyone who is looking for a higher-end basic set of earbuds. Comfortable to wear, great highs and lows and good bass. The cord is a good length for use during workouts and it is made of that good rubber-like plastic so it doesn't get wrapped around itself and it doesn't crease. I've only had them a couple of weeks so I cannot yet attest to long-term durability. So far so good, though!Update: Still performing well a few months on!"
4,Great for the price,"These earbuds are great, and provide a clear, full range of sound with almost any kind of music I've listened to with it - even classical. The bass respose is quite good too, even with this being an open-style earbud - some music feels like it's slamming right against your eardrum. For the price, you can't go wrong. I love the case too, it makes putting them away VERY easy, I HATE cord tangles and you don't get that with these. I like them better than a $30 pair of over the ear headphones I got before... can I say any more? LOL. Only one complaint - they can make the insides of your ears sore after a while where the pad touches the ear... but that's most likely my ears being sensitive, not the headphones."
2,Mediocre at best.,"At least to my ears. The fit is horrible, and since the fit is horrible, they sound horrible, with absolutely no bass at all. The pain is insane. I can't wear these for more than half an hour. These are as horrible as what comes bundled with most players. Don't waste your 10 bucks. Replaced them withSony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones."
3,Ok...but not for running,"I bought these as a replacement to the headphones that came with my MP3 player. They sound fine, but they don't fit in my ears very well and the right one falls out about every 45 seconds when I'm running."
1,Worst ive ever had,"These are bad just fall out of my ears after about 20 min of working out , never had this problem before i mean what's even the point if they dont stay in your ears . These things suck don't give these people your business ."
3,"Cheap, but not spectacular.","Some mp3 players come with terrible earphones, making these a good value. Otherwise, they're pretty average--I'd probably go with the Koss Plug earphones instead."
3,"great sound, but uncomfortable for small ears","These earphones had great bass and overall sound quality for their money. I loved how they sounded with my psp. However, these earphones hurt my ears with or without pads, so I couldn't listen to them longer than 15 minutes. this is probably do to the fact that I am 12 and have small ears. i returned them to target asap. i would recommend these unless you have small ears, especially for their value."
4,Excellent Value - nice case,"The case is a key buying point for me. It is a little flimsey, but it is the best design I've ever seen and works great."
5,Best for less,I orginally bought these headphones last year when i got my MP3 player. I didn't think these would last long but a year later they are in great condition and the sound has not changed! The only thing i did not like was the things (i don't know what people call them) over the actual headphone came off in about a week. Otherwise these are great and i'm going to buy another pair just because i love them!
4,ear buds with case,"They are good. The problem for me is that the earpiece is too big. Otherwise, I like the case and the way it winds the cord."
2,Not even worth 50 cents,These headphones probably aren't even worth 50 cents. As they are uncomfortable and really hard to hear. The sad thing is that I switch the ear that they are supposed to be in they actually are more comfortable. The issue with that is that you can't hear the sound as well. Granted you can't hear the sound well in the first place if they are put in the correct ear. I have to set my volume to max on my MP3 player AND max on the cord just to hear anything. With my favorite low end headphones (Koss KEP20) I normally have to set the volume to about 25% to hear things perfectly. Bass on these headphones is also nonexistent.There are a few positives. The cord feels exceptionally rugged for the price (although the connections look like they'll break easily). The on cord volume control is a great feature for this price.
3,don't roll up like we thought they would.,"The reviews said they roll up good. But they don't. Have trouble getting them back in the roll up case. Purchased a different set similar at a Walmart and they didn't roll up at all so we purchased these - they are better, but not much. Just OKAY."
3,Just OK,"Sound is not bad, but the foam earbud covers are not designed to last more than a few uses (I also tore one trying to get it on), and the cord seems a bit short. Also, the case is not the self-winding type, if you were wondering."
1,sony earbuds,"I sent this back the very same day, I thought it was a retractable cord earbud. It may be a good product but it wasn't what i was looking for"
2,Not too happy,I thought this actually recoiled. I did not realize you have to hand wined it up. It does not wind up easily. It is actually hard to do and the case is much larger that I thought it would be.
4,"for the price, you can't go wrong.","I've been using these for over a year now, and although I've broken my initial pair, I've re-brought them because they sound great and cost cheap. I find them to be very comfortable, even with out the included foam pads.Yes there are better earbud head phones out there, but they're most likely expensive. If you're like me and you tend to break your headphones over time, then these are the answer!"
5,Perfect Earbuds for the iPod Nano,"I've been on the lookout for replacement earbuds for my nano and finally found these. I think they are just awesome and believe Apple should bundle these with their nano. For the price this is a steal.With the right EQ setting on the nano, I just love these buds. Excellent Bass and with the 'Treble Booster' EQ setting in the iPod ON, these buds become perfect nearly.Before getting these buds I bought Senn HD-202, Grado SR-60 and Koss KSC-75 and though all of these are really good for different kinds of music that I listen, none of them compliment my iPod Nano the way these buds too. With the Winding case, their style, their sound quality and an unbelivable price I think they are just the perfect buds for the nano. As for their comfort, I think they are well suited for people on the move and are as comfortable as the original apple buds.Go get these and soon you'll be getting another pair."
5,Very Pleased - but price increased since purchase,"Grabbed a set based on several other reviews. The cost was around $6.99. I am very pleased but when I looked into ordering another set, the price had jumped a couple of bucks."
5,Great earphones!,"I love these earphones! The case is very convenient and protects the phones well. The sound quality is great, even compared to any other headphones that you can buy for much more money (I am not a headphone aficionado, mind you, but I have had a few pairs in my life). I would definitely recommend these for any music lover."
1,SHOCKINGLY bad,"Bought these earphones today and already hate them. Every 10 seconds or so the earpieces give me tiny little electric shocks to my ears. Not necessarily painful, but very uncomfortable and *NOT* what you want in a pair of headphones. I was surprised to see another reviewer had the same experience with this product.Note: I've used many other sets of headphones with my iPod and never had this problem. I'm taking these back to the shop tomorrow."
5,Excellent sound quality,"I can't believe this headphones cost only 6$. Amazing sound clarify you won't believe. Excellent and faithful bass and crisp treble. Ultra-light, just six grams; you won't feel as if you are wearing them.Only negative point: The case that comes along to wind up the extra cord length is a waste. The cord is so small that you have no need to wind it. I just trashed the case."
2,Not inner canal type,"The picture gives the impression these maybe inner canal type headphones, but they aren't. They're the old-fashioned huge bud that pains small ear holes. Had to return these, because neither my wife or I can tolerate those.Since we didn't use them, we have no idea how they sound."
2,evaluation,not what I was looking for. product no better than cheapos that come with cheap mp3 players
4,dont buy this if you got small ear!,"This headphone is fine for being inexpensive. However it does hurt your ear, if you have small ear like mine."
1,"Watch out, not a user friendly company-Agfa Store","My family ordered this for me thinking it was what I wanted, a retractable ear-bud unit. It is not, just a case to wind the wires around (storage?). I had opened the package and found that I did not want this item. Their customer service department said if it's opened you cannot return it! After I talked to a supervisor, he grudgingly said I could return it for a 15% re-stocking fee. Sorry, but I think this company does not know what CUSTOMER SERVICE means."
3,These earbuds ain't all that,"I think I've had these earbuds for 1 or 2 years. Below are pros and cons about these earphones:Pros:- great sound quality- The winding case is pretty cool- lightweight- the price is reasonable (bought it at the store)Cons:- Just like almost all earbuds (i have owned), with more usage, the cable's outer jacket starts to come out at the tip of the earbud. So now, I see the thin wires and sound comes from only one earpiece :(- The little black thing on the earbud that says ""SONY L"" came off several months after purchase- They always fell out of my ears!!!!! (I use them only at work)So unless you can withstand the cons, I do not recommend these earbuds."
2,Don't fit,The sound might be great if they could fit in my ear. If you have small ears do not get these. The buds are even larger than the buds that come with your ipods. Since the buds just barely fit the sound was tinny.
2,"Good price, good sound, bad quality","the price was right, the sound quality was great but after only 3 months of using them the cord started cracking in 3 different places! and the wires are slowy being exposed. i use the case most of the time and otherwise it stays in a small pocket in my backpack. no one mentioned this in other reviews so i'm not sure if i'm the only one... but i'd rather pay a little more to get sennheiser ones because those lasted me at least 3 years."
3,"Good Sound, Failed Later","I was on my second pair of these when I became greatly disapointed. I absoluty love Sony but I have to give these 3 stars. GREAT sound, but after 2 weeks, the left ear bud lost all bass and became extremly tin sounding. Basicly if you get one speck of dust in the these things your done. I would suggest a pair of behind the ear headphones, sony of corse, Dont get my wrong sony is the best electronics out there next to bose, but these are just too delicate for headphones"
4,Good headphones for the price,These headphone are good for their price. Sound comes in clear. I think it is even better than the headphones my ipod came with.
4,"Nothing special, but good for average use.","You hear music. That's pretty much it. It doesn't filter sound very well, but it does come with a spiffy winding case which i'm using for my sennheiser cx-300s."
1,"Very poor fit, don't stay in my ears!","- I'm unable to use them; they appear to have a very poor fit at least to my ears, and simply fall out. I'd recommend actually trying these before purchase."
1,Item Not available,"I ordered this on April 25th. Today is May 15th, 2010 and the item still has not shipped. It is shown as ""in stock"". They should not list this as in stock if it is not in stock. Poor shipping, or minimally; false advertising re availability. Update: It is now May 23rd,and the item still has not shipped; and it is still shown as ""in stock""."
1,VERY painful,these headphones are horrible!!!!!!my ears are hurting after five minutes of using the headphones.not worth the $$
1,Useless. Too small Cord. Can't reach from my PC to Ears.,I don't know about sond quality as I couldn't use it. I bought these so that I can listen to Music or Web Seminar by connecting to Desktop Under my desk and cord cannot reach my ears. Too short a cord. Make sure when you shop the cord length is enough atleat 5 feet or more.
1,not what I expected,"I thought I could wear the earbuds and wind up the leftover cord, so that I didn't have tangles. Nope -- it winds up (into a cheap plastic case) only when you're not using it. I wouldn't have bought it, had I known.Joan Price, author of Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk about Sex After Sixty ([...]"
1,I hate these,"I bought these about a week ago and am planning to light them on fire [not worth returning--fire is fun].1. Sound quality is just terrible. I put in some NIN and the bass guitar was near absent, and absoultely overpowered treble.2. They won't stay in my ears at all.3. The cord is made of some sort of different material. It looks/feels cheap and I dont think it will last.I'm lighting this on fire and buying a different pair of earbuds."
2,"Sound good, don't fit","I ordered these with my sony fm radio because so many said the sounded great. If I hold them in my ears, they do sound great. But, they don't stay in my ears and were such a hassle I threw them away. Maybe it's my ears, but I tried several different ways, to no avail."
2,Not worth the money or time,This is not worth your time. They are not easy to keep in the case and the earbuds are rather uncomfortable. A good idea but poor execution.
3,Uncomfortable,Product works well enough. The ear buds are very large and very uncomfortable. Packaging is a little awkward. Sounds quality is fine. Inline volume control is convenient.
3,Cheap but good,"These guys are really nothing special; they're not particularly comfortable, the sound quality isn't very good, and they feel pretty cheap. But they get the job done, the winding case is a nice feature, and they're only $10.One word of warning, though: I didn't think the foam/felt padding added very much to the comfort of the buds, but DON'T LOST THEM. If the buds are in the case without the pads either in the sockets or on the buds, the the case makes a TON of noise when it's jostled, like in your pocket or something. Took me a while to figure out what was going on, and by then I'd lost the pads. Not the end of the world, but definitely annoying."
5,Good Tape,"Nice strong tape. We ship out several packages a week and this tape holds up nicely, easy to work with and does what it is made to do at a great price!"
5,This is the tape you are looking for,We use a lot of tape for packaging. This is the best tape I've found for the price. It is strong and sticky. It is easy to find the end of the tape and it does not split or tear. It is as good as the expensive big name tape companies but the price is better than the name brand offerings.
5,"Great value, all around packing tape","What more can I say for a packing tape.. It does what it needs to do, stick, and it's good at that!This is not like the cheap tapes that you can buy from your dollar store. This one is thick (3.5mil), you can feel that it's thicker compared to cheap packing tapes and it really sticks very good.I highly recommend this packing tape!"
2,not sticky enough,PRO - thick tape and 1 day shipping through Amazon Prime (my main reason for purchasing)CON - Agree with the other buyer and it's not comparable to Scotch. The adhesive on this tape is not sticky enough and I had some of it lifting off both boxes and kraft envelopes. Going out to Costco to get some Scotch brand to use on shipping boxes.
1,Cheap tape,"i bought this tape to tape packages , put clear film over my name on plastic item so as it lasts I work in a distribution center in socal and i use up 2 sharpe's a month but in between time of purchase and it being use up i like my name to stay on it this tape is not crystal clear its adhesive is blotchy and the adhesive is weak at the distribution center i use some really good tape its fro intertape polymer groupIntertape 89263 Carton Sealing Tape 1.9-Inches x 55 Yards, 1.7-Mil, 6-Pack, Clear"
4,Great photos of 1960's to 1970's U.S. muscle cars.,"A collection of actual print and magazine advertisements from the big American auto makers highlighting big engine, loud and fast cars from early 60's to early 70's.These advertisments not only show the autos in a great photographical light, they give us a snapshot of the popular culture of the time."
3,Good training text,"Some students find this book a lot to read (500 pages) but the pictures are good and the vocabulary listings are the best in the business. Some state exams where not written with this text in mind which means the instructor will need to focus the students on missing material or use additional texts. The safety section is one of the better ones in the industry. As a stand alone reference this is excellent for the self study student or as a second text to read in preperation for the test, this book is very highly recomended."
2,Shoddy workmanship,"Within hours of ordering this item, my son learned from others that it had a history of complaints. I preferred to be optimistic; however, it didn't take too many days before my son was gluing it back together."
3,Pretty and cheap,"This rifle looks pretty good and that is what you should buy it for. The ""laser"" site is good for playing with cats. Think of it as a cheap toy gun that happens to spit out plastic BB's and you will not be disappointed. Hobbytron is a good relible vender."
2,Get what you pay for...,"I've seen a lot of plastic airsoft guns that are good enough for playing out in the woods with friends and that will stand up to a few drops.This is not one of those guns. Usually I will buy the cheaper pistols, and spend extra dough on rifles. I found this gun at an excellent deal and decided to give it a shot. It was cheap, so I didn't care so much. I'm not sure if this is the type of quality that consumers expect on a cheap airsoft rifle $[...], the shoddy build quality was a little surprising, even for this price. I'm by no means an expert ""airsofter"" but I know crap when I see it.However, if you want to buy something that looks pretty so you can display it, and that's all it will be for, then go for it. It certainly looks nice. If you want to buy a gun that will hold up when playing around with friends, then look elsewhere."
2,YAWN,"Another writer referenced this series by Cole Manning and I thought it sounded interesting, but I was wrong. The plot is nonexistent, the humor always just misses the mark and the ending was abrupt. Since it was altogether uninteresting; I won't read the rest of the series. Of course, the books may get better as they go along so you might want to start with the second in the series. There are only three in the series, however, so I'm not hopeful."
5,A reference that health care professionals will relish,"The collaborative effort of Ben-Erik Van Wyk and Michael Wink,Medicinal Plants Of The World isn't just another casual listing of plants and their homeopathic applications: it's an in-depth, scientifically accurate, superbly presented, seminal survey and guide to the best-known medicinal plants and describes over three hundred plants and relatives with short descriptions, geographic origins, therapeutic category, historical and modern uses, and active ingredients. Add 700 color photos to help identification and a checklist of the top 900 plants listed by scientific and common name and you have a reference that health care professionals will relish and refer to time and time again."
4,Very good photos!,"The photos are really very helpful to identify the plants. Often you realize that plants you know and see everyday are usable herbs.The book is very systematically. It is not the type of herb books that tells that herbs can do everything and it is not very enthusiastic about herbs, but I find it most usfull."
3,Right brain wrong body!,it's Ok this book is about a boy who called Gary needs a vacation...from himself. Bullies are constantly beating him up. his only friend is his computer. even his little sister doesn't like him.But now Gary's dream is about to come true. He's going to exchange bodies with another kid for a whole week.Gary can't wait to get a new body. Until something horrible happens. And Gary finds out his new body isn't exactly human..
4,A BEE BOOK,THIS IS ABOUT A BOY WHO WANTS TO TRAD LIVES WITH ANOTHER BOY BUT HE AKXALY TURNS INTO A BEE AND THEN HE TRIS TO TRUN BACK TO HIS SELF
3,Below average in every way,"I agree with the other review. The book is spotty and jumps from one thing to the next. The plot isn't even all that exciting. Around the middle you'll realize that the words are just repeating. ""How will I get out of here? Will I be like this forever? What will my mom say?"". You don't get the will to turn the page and find out what comes next because honestly, you won't care. The book focuses on a single character that you won't have time to care about. You should skip reading this book, there are much better ones."
2,What a boring book,"i do agree taht this book was boring of the repeating words, and the way the author writes the book. there was no good parts and no good plot. nothing but oh no will i become back to human. the first time i read it, i just stop reading in chapter 4."
1,WORST BOOK EVER,Me and my friend decided to buy a few goosebump books as a joke. we read them beacause how poor of an auther R.L is but why im afraid of bees is beyond bad its worse than watching 30 hours of documentarys on rocks.Although its so crappy its good for a laugh. such as in the book it says bees eat honey when we all know they DONT.In close all i have to say is R.L stines why i am afraid of beesis as bad as R.Ls face
3,Buzz...............?,"I got this book at a store and now I'm wondering why I did. Is this book a joke? I mean, there is no plot, no scary parts. Just some ""oh no, I'm stuck being a bee"" thing. And I do agree, when everything seems like it was going to fail, it doesn't.Gary Lutz is tired of being himself and when he sees person-to-person vacation thing, he calls them. Then one day a bee went inside his home while he's about to switch bodies with the other person, Dirk. Something horrible happens and now Gary is stuck in a bee's body.Okay, I'm not insulting the book or anything, but is OKAY and I rank it three stars."
3,"Not scary, but fun","The bad news for readers is that this book isn't scary at all. I don't know if it was meant to be, but if you're looking for scares this isn't the one to read. The good news is that the main character's time as a bee is nicely developed, and the story moves along quickly, even if it's fairly bizzare. I did feel sympathy for the main character and his awkwardness, so good character development there.An offbeat entry in the Goosebumps series. More of a borrow from a local library."
3,Drivers need work.,"The card is FireWire 800 but the Microsoft drivers is not written well and you have to tweak it in order to get FireWire 800 performance. 400 Mbps is all you can get by default. Unless you are a computer geek, this is not good for Windows users. On Mac 10.x you can get Firewire 800 Mbps out of the box."
4,Post-war working class England brought to life.,"Sillitoe's work shows Arthur living his life to the extent his class boundaries will allow. Drinking, womanising, and violence dominate Arthurs life away from his lathe. We follow him on the breathless ride that is his life in the first part of the novel Saturday Night, and then on his reajustment to a calmer more sustainable life in Sunday Morning. The perspective the reader is given is Arthurs if only he could articulate it. This allows the reader to experience the working class perspective without the limits that somone lacking the education to express themselves as effectively would have. This is the key to the novel as the reader can utterly empathise with Arthur. A working class novel that does not focus on poverty but how class frustrations are expressed makes a welcome change."
2,MISLEADING ADVERTISING/,Apparently you haven't learned your lesson on the ML120 Makita flashlite. You are still advertising this flashlite as a complete unit but sending to the customer as without the battery. I made you send me a battery. WAKE UP!
4,great,Great flashlight.re-charges quicklyI've had this for several years and it's still going strongNo problems at all.Get a spare batt as well.
3,Flashlight,The flash is all right but I like the 9.6 volt one better. The flashlight head is not as big on the 9.6 volt one as the 12 volt.
5,Good spotlight,This light is bright and handy. I can set it up to stand by itself and the light will illuminate quite a long distance.
3,Good Overview,"There is a lot of material in this book, but none of it goes into much detail. It is quite basic."
4,Good Shocks,"Truck installed on is a 1999 Dodge Ram Diesel 4x4. I bought these shocks to replace some very rusty Monroe Shocks. I received them when they were scheduled to show up and in perfect condition. While I didn't want to pay a whole lot for shipping I did the cheapest available option. While waiting for the shocks to show up, I used WD-40 on all of the rusty bolts to save time on the install. After they arrived the installation time was about 3 hours. The front shocks are a tight fit for the ram diesel but it can be done. After the install I found the ride has smoothed out a good bit. Rancho makes a good quality inexpensive shock for your truck. I would defiantly recommend these shocks to anyone."
4,un disco solo para conocedores y amantes de la buena musica,Capaz es uno de los discos mas personales de Ruben.. Se podria decir que Amor y Control es el mejor tema del disco. auque pienso en ti haya sido la mas difundida. Hay que tomar en cuenta el segundo y tercer tema.. Dedicados a su madre. y al cilindro. Lo maravilloso de ruben es la duracion de sus letras... Uno las puede escuchar 10 años despues y parecen escritas ayer..
3,Monaco GP,"decent video detailing the history of the GP of Monaco, not great but one of the better ones on the market today."
3,"Has the big hits, but lacking","As the other reviewers have said, the Classic Masters collection just doesn't cover enough material to be worthy of the April Wine discography. I find ""The Hits"" much more palatable as a long time fan, but it too is missing some of the best material and has some ""fluff"" that doesn't belong. Although it is expensive and somewhat hard to find, the box set is the way to go. It covers the band's career from the early days through their hitmaking period and includes some excellent live performances. It's always tough to please all of the people all of the time on a greatest hits collection, but classic masters definitely misses the boat."
4,Brought Back Memories,"My frist April Wine was Nature of the Beast in the form of 8-track, then change to cassette and finally purchased Nature of the Beast on CD years ago but had trouble finding a few other songs that I enjoyed. The Classic Masters did just that provide me some of the lost hits that I enjoyed many years ago. Great memories, great songs, would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed their music."
5,It truly is classic,"April Wine is a great Canadian rock group. Their sound is so unique and original. This CD, 'Classic Masters,' is a perfect collection. The sound quality is great, and it truly captures the greatness that is April Wine.This CD is an excellent edition to anybody's collection. 'Roller,' 'Love Has Remembered Me,' 'I Like To Rock,' 'Just Between You and Me,' and their classic cover of King Crimson's '21st Century Schizoid Man' are all here. And it's really cheap too. But, in my opinion, it's worth every cent.This CD is highly recommended. If you like classic rock, April Wine is a group you don't want to pass by. ENJOY!!!"
5,"A Beautiful Woman, A Beautiful Voice","My wife and I have been fans of Melissa Errico since we saw her in 1993, in the City Center Encores production of ""Call Me Madam"". She stole the show right out from under Tyne Daly. Since then, we have gone to see her in everything she's done: ""High Society"", the devestatingly underappreciated ""Amour"", the phenomenal revivals of ""Aunt Dan and Lemon"" and ""Finian's Rainbow"", and even the painful ""Dracula: The Musical"" (I hate to make the pun, but yes, ""Dracula"" sucks).When she released her divine solo debut, ""Blue Like That"", we couldn't wait to get our hands on it. Ms. Errico did not dissapoint. For me, the standout track is ""Company"". She brings to mind a young Julie Andrews, crossed with Joni Mitchell. What a pair!Last week, when our eight year old son was at a sleepover and our three and a half year old was tucked in bed, my wife and I opened up a bottle of wine and put on this album. It doesn't get any better than that!"
5,Shining debut,What a terrific solo debut for Broadway singer Melissa Errico. Gorgeous voice. She even out-Colvin's Shawn Colvin in the title tune.
3,Peculiar Debut By Such a Talented Singer,"I've been reading so much about Melissa Errico being this hot Broadway star, and how she was going to be this year's Norah Jones. Well, she chose some really strange songs to comprise her first album. Some of the songs are pretty good, beautiful in fact, but I still get the sense that she's slumming and capable of much better. This album is not very commercial, and yet it's not quirky enough to be artistic either. It's just kind of okay. Now that the CD is out of my player, I will probably never listen to it again."
2,Doesn't live up to expectation,"I'd heard all about the amazing voice. I'd heard about the already tumultuous Prima Donna reputation. And yet this CD lived up to none of it. No sparks or big jaw-dropping numbers here. Nice to have on the stereo if you're in the tub, cleaning house, or reading a book. Fortunately, I was able to borrow this from a co-worker and then give it back. No desire to hear it a second time, and glad I didn't spend the money!"
2,Blue and Bland,"I agree with Disappointed in NYC. Melissa has a wonderful voice. However, nothing on this recording put forth any emotion or excitement. ""Hot in Here"" should have been called ""Tepid in Here"" since she sang without giving any real sense of desire. In fact all the songs were at the same bland vocal presentation. I bought this cheap and used and will sell it the same way."
4,Guilty Pleasures,A lot of ideas for allies and adversaries in this book and one I recommend to anyone wanting to go in depth in a Scarred Lands Campaign. Organizations to oppose and to join are the order of the day with prestige classes for at least two of the groups and a wealth of information that can be used to create your own quality adventures in this great setting.
4,I love Sarah & Vinnie,"There are some hysterical tracts on it (Hooman getting arrested, the Urinator), however, out of five years of shows, I think some different choices could have been made that would have been funnier. Overall, it was pretty funny, but definitely way too short!"
4,Bay Area Radio Morning Shows First Album,"For a radio station album, it's pretty good. 4 original songs, and various tracks. Mother-in-law piece is worth buying it for."
4,Bang for the buck,"A must-have item if you're into Sarah & Vinnie. The Slappy songs are both keepers; Sarah's sexy, melodic singing leaves me yearning for an entire CD of wall-to-wall Slappy. Her voice is reminiscent of Juliana Hatfield (""Spin the bottle""). All the radio snippets are laugh-out-loud funny particularly the ones with Hooman getting arrested and Sarah's story of peeing herself in Freshman year. At the color guard competition finals. While competing. This conslusively proves Sarah is the grossest. Four stars instead of five because 52 minutes for a CD is terribly short, especially considering they generate 3-4 hours of material daily."
4,4 DiNardo's,I've listed to Vinnie Crackorn & Sarah Clark since 1995--love 'em! It's so great to be able listen to them everytime I get into my car now with the CD. I agree that it's too short. It would be great to get bits of their show from the earlier years when Uzette was still the producer. One of the best bits was Vinnie's 30th--how come that didn't make it??? Still loads of fun. Keep it up guys!
3,Over-edited,"I was disappointed that the bits were sooooo edited! I was listening to the show the morning Hooman got arrested at Sarah's house and I have to say -- the edited version of that bit was nowhere near as funny as the full length version.Aside from the over-editing, the CD is probably worth the money(depending upon how big of a S&V; fan you are) but skip the lame Intro and Outro."
3,Adequate dictionary,"This almost-pocket dictionary is adequate for finding general meanings.It has more of a church slant on the Hebrew meanings, I think, than unbiasedbiblical Hebrew definitions."
1,"Not white, no mounting kit","The front (bezel) is not white, it is ivory. Also, there is no '5.25"" mounting kit' nor ""installation guide"" included, as claimed. The distributor is buying these bare drives in bulk, and repackaging them. This is not a retail kit. Do some research on model # ""FD235HFC291"" to confirm my statements. If you want an off-white drive that will fit in a 3.5"" bay, buy this drive. If you want what is advertised, look elsewhere."
4,Works like it should,Received the drive in good time. No box or fancy packing just bubble wrap thus the 4*s. Installed and tested with no probems. Still working fine today 1/9/07.
3,better than their first,"Some catchy songs.Smart lyrics, with a balance of moods conveyed.(Still, it seems as if the music is trying to overcome the ego of the band's leader - and failing at times.)Give it a shot."
3,Fizzle,"This band is the project of Alaska-native and the very talented John Roderick. He ended up playing in many bands and living in Seattle. Fame didn't hit him in his early twenties and now he's back at it ten years later. Roderick worked with guys from Death Cab For Cutie and Harvey Danger two years ago to create his first record. It was immediately embraced by the indie crowd. The Long Winters were inspired by a lot of singer/songwriter music from the late 1970s/early 1980s. For this album they also got Peter Buck and Ken Stringfellow to toot their horns. So this is much a supergroup of American indie bands of the last twenty years. Still this is the new sound of Seattle. The focus of songwriting is a major focus. You get the feeling that maybe they heard Abbey Road along the way. They have great harmonies and a wall of sound. Maybe there are too many songs on this record, but most of them are good. I am still wondering if this band is Harvey Danger in drag?"
5,Outstanding...,"I have read many books on controversies in the gay and lesbian liberation movement, but I've read none more fascinating and eloquent than this one. Chasin challenges us to question if what we really WANT is to be a part of the homogenized mass-media culture that we've been seeking to gain acceptane in. I was also impressed by the exhaustive research that went into this piece. I was also impressed to learn that Ms. Chasin has worked with the IGLHRC association, and with up-and-coming activist Kerri Gawreluk. It's wonderful to finally see a book that is a result of collaboration between true pioneers in the new gay/lesbian generation."
3,Incompatible with 18 volt tools,This charger is incorrectly listed as an accessory for some Makita 18 volt cordless tools. The specs for this item say it is for charging batteries from 7.2 to 14.4 volts.
4,A nice low cost entry cable,"This cable is a good way to improve your connection for clearer video and offers the flexibility of both composite and s-video. I immediately saw a cleaner picture with less distortion of text and textures in game. Maybe it's not the top of line or even midrange, but it's a economical way of improving your video at half the price of the next level cable MonsterCable offers."
4,Scuffer Advice,This scuffer is okay. I still have mine from 2 years of use and it still does the job of scuffing but you can get a better scuffer that will last. I pretty much shot the shaper after using it to shape my cue stick. I would say this scuffer was designed for soft cue tips. One thing I do like about this scuffer is that it's of the same size as chalk and fits nice in my case.
5,Pool stick tip shaper.,I had this pool stick tip shaper before and it works pretty good. It has two sides one to shape the tip and the other to scuff off the old chaulk so that you can re- shape the pool stick tip use.
3,Yogilates?,"I've been doing yoga for over a year now. I'm also a teacher. There are a few new movements on this video but not much else. Frankly, I would rather do pure yoga."
2,doesn't sound like any teens I know...,"The plays in this collection attempt to tackle issues important to teens and end up sounding like badly written tv screenplays where everything is ""deep"" but resolved way too quickly. The dialogue is unrealistic and the characters shallow. I can't see handing any of these scripts out to high school students, expecting them to take the plays seriously."
2,The plays try hard to be great but fall short.,"The moral behind most of these plays is really a great attempt to teach a valuable lesson. However, these short plays offer no true insight into the world of on stage plays. Many readers will find the plays short and direct. These plays offer very little suspense and are a bore to read. Save time and money; buy Shakespeare."
5,Brass and Keys,"Clark Terry is a trumpet stylist who could only be compared to Johnny Hodges, the late great altoist from the Duke Ellington Orchestra. Like Hodges, Terry's sound and phrasing are instantly recognizeable. Place him next to 14 of the greatest jazz pianists and you have the makings of a real treat. The repertoire and mood achieved by Terry and company are near perfect. You'll marvel at Terry's effortless mastery of both horn and the blues on ""Intimacy of the Blues"" with Kenny Barron. ""L.O.V.E."" with Monty Alexander is a duet of fascinating phrasing with Terry indulging in spacious, open statements and Alexander building a rhythmic intensity reminiscent of Nat King Cole. Each one of these duo performances is a gem, unique in sound, creative in concept, and flawlessly executed. This is the most satisfying album I have listened to in years."
1,Defective CD,"Great song, as found on Ursula 1000's mix cd Ursadelica. However, it is important to note that this is not a regular audio CD and will not play back in many players. Beware."
1,"Horrible. These are wet-erase, not dry-erase","These look good, feel great in the hand, and have nice ink. The problem is that they simply do not erase.We've been through several dozen of these, different colors from different packages, in the last couple of weeks, using them on a variety of white boards--high-end (enamel on steel) and low-end (melamine on particle board). They uniformly do NOT erase. To remove the ink, we had to use cleaner, water, or glass cleaner, which of course is much more time-consuming than dry-erase boards are designed to be.I have several unopened packages that will not be used; we've replaced them with the other, much-better alternative options."
2,Not bright enough,I used these markers in my 1st and 2nd grade classroom. They did not last very long and were not bright enough to see from across the room. Expo markers last much longer and are well worth the price difference.
1,Save your $$$,"This may have been a good concert to have attended, but overall the music was below par for the fans of Traffic. In my humble opinion, Steve Winwood should have spent much more time on stage. John Barleycorn in particular suffered from not having Steve Winwood sing and play guitar. So, unless you are a hardcore fan, save your money and use it to purchase The Last Traffic Jam instead."
5,Dear Mr. Fantasy Tribute Concert,"This is a great dvd of an excellent concert, put together by Jim Capaldi's widowAninha. Musicians include Stevie Winwood, Pete Townsend, Joe Walsh, Bill Wyman, JonLord, and Yusuf Islam. As well as the band: Mark Rivera, Ray Cooper, Simon Kirke,Andy Newmark, Pete Bonas, Wix Wickens, and Dave Bronze-with Dennis Locorriere,Stevie Lange, and Margo Buchanan adding some great vocals!The arrangements of Jim Capaldi's tunes are excellent: Well-rehearsed and tight!The camera is always where it should be, and the lighting and minimal effects(combined with interesting camera work) make for great viewing as well.For anyone who was/is a Traffic fan, or just loves laid back Classic Rock, this dvdis really a must! I've already sent 2 to friends, and am preparing to order 2 more."
5,Fantastic! Warmly written and great ideas.,"Since this book just arrived, it seems somewhat premature to be reviewing it already -- but it has already proven well worth the cost. I absolutely love the gift-giving chapter, filled with incomparable ideas for giving wonderful gifts from the heart that only a Scrooge wouldn't love, but that won't break the bank.Same with wonderful ideas for holiday traditions, decorations, etc. Although I have not yet had a chance to try them, the recipes for making your own mixes (both practical and suitable for gift-giving), cleansers, etc. seem especially good. I havn't even gotten to the chapters on saving money and cutting costs yet, but am already thrilled with my purchase. I love it!"
4,An excellent money-saving tool,Readers gain various tips and insights into saving time and money with this book. Various tasks become more simple and less expensive. This book speaks more on how to save money than on how to free yourself from the greed and dependency that it provokes.
5,What A Helpful book!,"This a a great book with ideas and time savings for me. The title so describes the book, good choice! I love it!"
5,"Great Band, Great CD","I fortunately was given this CD by a band member of Carbon Leaf, and it literally didn't leave my CD player for weeks! I saw the guys play and they completely blew me away. The energy and quality of their live show is just awesome. This CD really captures the Carbon Leaf live experience. This CD is a really good introduction of Carbon Leaf. Some of my personal favorite of this disc are Home, Blue Ridge Laughing, Torn to Tattered, Wanderin' Around, American Tale, Desperation Song, and Toy Soldiers. However, all the songs are fantastic. This is just an all around great CD from an all around great band. Everyone do yourself a favor: start listening to Carbon Leaf."
3,"This Johnson Brothers Regency was less than ""Regent""","I purchased these bowls to replace ones that had been broken over the last 10 years. Unfortunately, the quality of these bowls were less than those in the rest of my collection. I knew I was in trouble when I saw the insignia on the bottom of the bowls was green versus the black of the originals."
5,Takes my heart and mind to Key West,"From the opening power chords the beginning to the finger snapping at the end, I am transported to my memories of Key West. While the lyrics are clever and somehwat double entendre, the music is ecclectic. Powerhouse rock from ""(Let's Have a) Hurricane party"" to a Keb Mo' type bluesy guitar on ""If You Don't Ask"". Buffet style ""Hurricane Party (in the Florida Keys"", Funky ""Mucho Blah Blah"" (my new phrase for too much B.S.). Drunken Country style from ""I Drink Too Much"" and Poco/America ""Southern Destination"". Tongue in Cheek references to Fantasyfest...Which brings us to...""What Happens in Key West"". It's about 2 people (fish out of water) that go Fantasyfest, run out of money, and do things they hope their families won't see. It sounds like Toby Keith may have heard this song before writing ""Mexico"". Fun and alive. When's the next one coming out?"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Jake Maroc's family have had it rough, and this has been rough on him. He decides to get back into the spirit of the whole martial arts thing, rather than using it to take out ganglords.Not going to be that easy though, as there are still spies, communists and other undersirables around to be dealth with."
4,Jackie DeShannon at her best!,"If you are unfimiliar with Jackie DeShannon, you won't understand why after listening to this collection of her best work. I just can't imagin anyone not knowing the words to at least one of these classics. These recordings sound like they were made yesterday as the quality goes. As far as the music, it may be a bit dated but are still quite entertaining. Her silky vocals are pure ear candy and her melodies are unforgettable.Treat yourself to a good listen."
2,"Sharp, but fragile...","I had this for about a year. I was really impressed with the sharpness and the damascus was very neat looking. However, this product is fragile and I can't recommend it.I have a very small workspace area in my apartment's kitchen. While I was preparing a rather large meal, the workspace got crowded and the knife got pushed to the floor. It didn't survive the drop and snapped at the handle. I just question having a metal as fragile as Damascus in the kitchen (leave em in the safe!!). I have recently purchased a custom S30V paring knife from Peter Atwood to replace this one."
4,Great Regency,"Our hero, Diamond, decides to help his old friend and neighbour get through her second London season. With her friend at his side, the Bella is soon breaking hearts, even our Diamond's. Add a mystery, some long lost relatives, a little murder and intrigue and you've got another great read by Ms. Lansdowne."
5,Best Buy!,"This has the makings of a best-seller: a complex plot, fully realized characters, humor, mystery, and suspense. The development of the hero's need to deal with his repressed memories gives the novel greater depth."
1,very poor entertainment,"I wasn't able to finish this book because of the preposterous plot, wooden dialogue, and cardboard characters. My advice is that you NOT buy this book."
2,The Death Of Ivan Ilych,I really love Tolstoy. I WISH I could say the same about this book. It's funny & wit..but still I crave for more... but the death if Ivan Ilych is actually all there is to it.
4,Critical care intravenous infusion drug handbook,This was far better than I had anticipated. Easy to use when on the run in busy er. Love it:)
5,Excellent resource for Emergency & Critical Care Nurses,"As an emergency RN, I need to be able to find IV drug and drip information quickly in an easy to use format. This book is the best I've found."
1,Stay Away from the CA-2014 2.0,"First of all, speakers slighty elude to the fact that you might want to listen to music, You can't do that with these speakers, I missed a $9.99 sale (orig $21) at staples, & I purchased them on Amazon, I felt so bad that, it wasn't worth returning, they are going straight to the Salvation Army Donate bin. the speakers on the box, look much bigger than the actual speakers, the sound quality reminded me of a portable AM transistor radio, I had as a 5 year old kid in 1969. These things remind me of the throw away speakers you used to get with the low end 486 & Pentium machines (Packard bell, etc). Beware of any low prices on these speakers, staples & others are trying to dump them, nice picture, nice box, bad sound period. Also I'm so down on these speakers, CA would never see penny of my money, If you can, listen to the speakers (at a store or a friends house)before you make a purchase. Save the shipping back & forth."
4,onlinegamer,"The speaker is definitely worth the money that I paid, I assure you that. but obviously, this doesn't compare with the sony or bose speakers that I previously had.The speakers are good at ""mid"" volume where the two speakers are producing about the same amount of volume. However, when you decrease the volume, the left speakerseems to become much softer than the right speaker. Although that's not a huge issue, I wanted to put it down here. Then, when you crank up the speakers, they become'crackly, but usually, we don't listen to things that loud. But in general, these speakers are a good product for the price I paid.Worth buying!"
1,Bad Bad Badddd....,"I bought these for a friend so yeah this is written in 3rd person. That being said, I bought these for her because she's a really good person and she needed something to listen to on her job while she works. Between shipping, I found some very old computer speakers that I picked up when I used to do IT work in a school in Louisville called JCC. These were very old like late 1990s speakers. But I figured I would lend them to her until the newer speakers arrived. When the new speaker arrived, I gave them to her and in 3 days she told me that they were terrible and just bad. She told me that the late 90s speakers sounded alot better than the new ones. Once more, she told me that these have an interference problem, causing her to have a bad reception on her radio at work.Bottom line, is that you might want to avoid these speakers especially if you're giving them to someone as a present. Unless you don't like them that much, you might not want to give these to anyone.Pass on these."
3,Not bad for the price,"The speakers are adequate and a good value for the price, but if you want really good sound from your computer, you should look for something else."
5,The Right Stuff.,"I have a SKIL HD77M and figured if I want to take care of my saw I should use the stuff they recommend. It's pretty cheap and does the job it's designed for. The old lube was really dark and thick and the saw would come to a stop pretty quickly as a result.Here are the steps I took to replace the lube:1 run saw for a minute,2 drain old oil,3 fill with Kerosine,4 run 20 seconds or so,5 drain,6 fill with Kero again,7 run 20 sec,8 drain well,9 fill with the above, SKIL Worm Drive Saw Oil (it did not require a whole tube)Results are the saw does run better and with less effort, also is it doesn't come to a stop quite so quickly. That tells me the old oil was pretty bad... I just feel better having clean new lube in my saw and that it is being properly lubricated."
1,ITEM WAS DEFECTIVE AND BROKE WITHIN WEEKS OF PURCHASE!!!,"WHEN I RECEIVED THE BALL, IT WAS DEFECTIVE. IT WAS NOT ROUND AT ALL...IT WAS COMPLETELY LOPSIDED AND MORE OVAL THAN ROUND. THEN AFTER A FEW WEEKS...IT BURST!!!! THERE WAS NOTHING SHARP ANYWHERE NEAR THE BALL. I WAS NOT BOUNCING OR EXCERCISNG ON THE BALL, SIMPLY SITTING ON TOP OF IT. AND I AM CERTAINLY NOT TOO HEAVY FOR THE BALL. YET 'DEALS IN MOTION' REFUSED TO REPLACE THE BROKEN BALL!!THE ITEM WAS VERY POORLY MADE, CHEAP, USELESS AND BROKE WITHIN WEEKS OF PURCHASE. I DID NOT OVERUSE THE BALL, INFACT I ONLY BOUGHT IT FOR SITTING ON!!! I RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE FROM A DIFFERENT SELLER WITH HIGHER STANDARDS AND BETTER QUALITY EQUIPMENT THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO STAND BY."
2,a bit of a disappointment,"First off, the cover of this book is probably the best piece of art in the book IMO, for the simple reason that it's the only piece besides the back cover that is in color. The rest of the book is black and white, even when it looks as if some of the art inside could have been painted in color. Some of the pieces featured in this book are little more than photo mish-mashes to make a scene, and some of those didn't really turn out well. If you really need an art fix, pick this up, but I think there are far better art books out there."
3,Concise is the key word here.,"I took some French in college, and wanted to review before starting classes again. This book is great for that purpose. The lessons are extremely concise. The drawback is that they might be a little too concise for beginners. Detailed explanations of grammatical rules/structure are not given; instead only very brief explanations followed by practical examples. The lessons are short, but they're effective if you really take your time and go through them slowly and thoroughly.My primary complaint is that absolutely NO help is given with pronunciation. Not a single word or phrase is followed by a pronunciation key.Overall, if you are looking to brush-up on your French, I would recommend this book. But if you are completely inexperienced with the language, this book might serve as a supplemental study guide, but not your primary resource."
5,Oh! So Romantic.,"This is the first book I have read by Debbie Macomber. I read it in one sitting, could not put it down. Very romantic. Look forward to reading more of her books."
5,Playboy and the Widow - Debbie Macomber,Debbie Macomber is a wonderful writer of love stories. You can tell she knows her stuff. She travels to various cities/states to get a feel of the places she writes about. I have read almost 100 of her books & loved every one of them.
3,Book description,"THE PLAYBOY AND THE WIDOWAn earthy widow and mother of two was a far cry from the stylish glamour girls dashing man-about-town Cliff Howard usually dated. But one look into Diana Collins's soulful brown eyes had him thinking about apple pie instead of ""cheesecake."" Her irresistible blend of womanly strength and heartbreaking vulnerability enticed him as beauty never had.Try as he might to resist, ""ladykiller"" Cliff was soon forced to admit that this plucky widow and her rambunctious daughter could grow on a man. But could they start a dyed-in-the-wool playboy dreaming of domestic bliss?"
3,Not easy to follow the instruction.,".... Though the author has put in a great amount ofeffort in the illustration aspect, somehow the jargon and tech talkjust lost me. Definitely not for the beginner."
2,A Good Book for Apprentices,"I recommend this book to any apprentice or student locksmith. But the title is misleading: ""Locksmithing from Apprentice to Master."" There's nothing in it for a master locksmith."
3,Holes too large,"Too many holes in both the salt and pepper shaker and the holes are too large. Nice looking set, though"
3,Holes too BIG!,"The salt and pepper shakers are lovely, nice fit in the hand, but the holes are TOO BIG! I was constantly having to warn the user to be careful of over-salting or over-peppering their food. Finally, I taped over half of the holes on each shaker so an ""over-doing-it warning"" is no longer necessary."
1,another disappointment...,"Not as far from what Shadow Iris should be as the melamine tray that I ordered at the same time, but still another pale copy. The 3-4mm holes in both of the shakers are way too large as mentioned by other reviewers, and the ones in mine are noticeably and annoyingly off-center. Also, there are pits in the surface finish, and all of the above makes me wonder if these are seconds or knock-offs."
1,Poorly written with poor punctuation.,"I bought this book after reading the other reviews. Although the case was about the death of a seemingly lovely person, the author seems to want to talk about himself as well as his colleagues, family, career (hx of law school, GI bill, etc). Such extra verbage was not necessary and did not add to the story - it mainly seemed to add to the interest of the author. Also, the editor was obviously a close friend and chose to let these errors go by without clearly using their power to keep the author in his place - the background. I was bored by the writing, excessive storytelling and lack of coherence. This author should stay in fiction and stay away from true victims and their families. That way, he can improve his craft and protect the innocent from his ramblings."
3,missing a lot of information,"This book is more about the man who wrote it then the victim & the killer.I cound not find ages, dates of birth, where born etc."
4,Nice focus on Squirtle,My kids are avid Pokemon fans and have watch this DVD several times already. The DVDs that focus on one character are nice when a fan wants to learn more about the history of a particular Pokemon.
1,I'll Pass Next Time,"The product is nice in that it only costs ~$10. But that's about all I can say for it. I wasted $10. If you don't have pets,kids, or strong winds, it'll do as a makeshift screen door, but I personally have 4 cats and even the smallest can make it give and pull it down. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with pets or who really want a legitimate screen door. Just buy a real one, or put $20-$30 in to get supplies and make your own. You'll be happier for it. Trust me."
3,A little hokey,"I happen to be very interested in the Cherokee nation since I found out recently about my ancestry however, I felt the production was a little lack luster. Having said that I still learned a lot about the history of the trail of tears and I think I will watch it again just in case I missed something the first time around . There was a lot of information."
4,WARNING-this is other movies repackaged!!!,"Fair warning, this DVD set includes movies sold separately elsewhere. I was disappointed because I already HAD one of the videos, (with West Studi and James Earl Jones about the Trail of Tears) and had already seen one. No where on this DVD's homepage does it mention WHAT those films are!!This seems like a rip off of good films to me-repackaging...Be warned."
5,Trail of Tears,"I am a history buff. My daughter lives in Dahlonega, GA, an important site of the Trail of Tears. Even though I am not personally responsible for this governments treatment of the Indians, I am ashamed for them. This DVD is a well done portrayal of this event. I am glad I have added it to my collection."
3,Trails of Tears,This movie came to me in very good condition.I am glad I bought this one.My family was a part of what happen to the Cherokee's and I was told about how they were pushed out of the area's that they had lived for so long.I never knew just how unfair they were treated until I watched this movie.I had always heard how the Goverment mistreated the American Indians and stole everything from them.I am proud to say that I do have Cherokee Blood in my back ground but there is so little it dosent count.This movie tell just how wrong they were mistreated.I am glad I now own it.
1,Very disappointed!,The scenery was beautiful. When Wes Studi was talking at least there were subtitles translating what he was saying but the entire DVD was NOT subtitled/closed captioned. Thus a waste of my time and money - reason for my poor rating -- I could not understand what was being said. :(
4,tears,"another dvd i am looking forward to watching, i heard it was very good ,thats why i bourght it.trail of tears ,a native american documentary a true story."
5,Trail of Tears,This is purchased for a gift for a friend. So I actually have not reviewed it. Hopefully my friend will find this very interesting
2,Trail of Tears DVD,This arrived in a timely manor but when I played it it kept stopping all through the two DVD's. It would skip a small portion and that made it difficult to watch. Am very displeased with this item which is clearly the fault of the manufacturer not Amazon.
2,Very Misleading Ad,"Good films however the Ad is very misleading in as much as a Total Run Time of "" 700 minutes "" is advertised when in fact the actual total run time is less than 300 minutes..........."
3,How WWII affected the French wine industry,"As the author points out, this is neither a book on wine nor on war. But I thought it was very revealing in how the French had to live during the 5 years of their occupation during World War II. It is heartbreaking at times and naughtily funny at others. It made me want to go to a catalog and order a few old french wines in tribute to the wine growers in the book."
5,:),"Everyone raved about this book so I was excited to read it, but still have yet to even finished it.."
4,A nice read,"This is a book for a cool autumn day. When I finished it I immediately opened a nice bottle of wine and toasted the authors, whose descriptions had generated my thirst. First and foremost, this is a book about people, wine industry people in the throes of war. And then there are the Nazis, always prime fodder whether the form be fiction or non-fiction. In some ways the book is like an ensemble movie, with a set of parallel plot threads that are woven together at the end. The climax of the book is truly its high point. The end of the war, the magnificent 1945 vintage, and the individual stories, some quite moving, all come together in a warm and comforting crescendo. Whether you're a wine buff or a WWII buff, this is a very nice read. Keep your glass handy."
2,thin analysis clouded by romanticism,"Despite a long bibliography at the back of the book, the book suffers from a lack insightful analysis and sharp writing. Although it is fun to hear about the wine (I actually have a greater interest in French wine as a result of reading the book) the book glosses over the historical complexities. As far as a history book goes, it provides very little. Everyone comes out a winner. The Kladstrups seem hesitant to criticize anyone whom they actually name, covering potential sins of collaboration or weakness with elaborate descriptions of wine, dinners, and romantic portrayals of life in the vinyard. They seem as reluctant to delve into things as the French did after the war. The chapter on the collaborator who made millions in wine deals with the Germans, ""Uncle Louis,"" remains uncritical of such profiteering. It is as though most of the writing took place after a long meal with several glasses of wine. A disappointing read."
2,Interesting but Disorganized and Lightweight,"There are certainly a number of interesting story lines in this book but it is written in a breezy lightweight style and follows no discernable pattern or outline. Really this is a collection of short stories around a vague central theme of the efforts of ""most"" Frenchmen to protect their famous wine collections from the Germans. While certainly the stories from Alsace, Burgundy, Champagne and Bordeaux are decidedly different, there are many connected themes, such as the conflict between passive resistance and active collaboration, that remain unexplored. Further, the actual brutality at the doorsteps of many of these people is glossed over in favor of repeated stories about doctored wines with grand cru labels. This could have been a much better, richer book."
3,Interesting historical novel,"Sometimes slow, confusing reading, but interesting history. I was impressed by the families commitment to protecting their families land and traditions during the war."
3,"Of wine, war and men","This is a pleasant book which reads quite quickly past the first 80 pages. The beginning is indeed a little slow. Besides, am I already too old that I consider awkward to be told what is a ghetto and what was Kristallnacht?The authors probably remained faithful to the stories they were told, but it is a little weird to read that Ms So and So was hiding Jews in a shed in the garden while the Germans were occupying her chteau, but still she was lucky because she could save her wines. Strange perspective.Apart from that, I delighted in various anecdotes, for example the way the Résistance learned about German troops' progression by the orders they sent to the French chteaux.All things considered, the book is... well... very human."
5,One of the best wine books ever,"I have given away 12 copies of this book to friends who also love wine. After years of reading wine books ""Wine and War"" is an absolute delight. The reading is fascinating and fun. It is almost like fiction which makes it all the more interesting. We travel in France. On my next trip into wine country I'm going to check out some of the stories, if I can. This is a must read for any Francophile Wine lover."
2,What are the authors trying to say?,"The book lacked writing style and content. The book is written in a very primitive boring language. Short simple sentences made me think that the book is written for teenagers. Part of it could be due to the translation of the stories from French to English. Now, content... I'm still trying to understand what point the authors were trying to make. This is a convoluted compellation of stories loosely woven in a WWII timeline. Authors have taken stories of 20 rich wine families and applied them to the entire nation, which made for a very rosy account of one of the most tragic wars in the 20th century..."
3,The French love of wine.,"I thought this was an original concept of a war story. The authors tell of the French love of the national drink of wine and the German Occupation. The Germans took a portion of the output of the vineyards, and the French were starved for wine. Various stories of the burgundies/champaynes and other assorted wines were told in this conglomoration of a book about wine and WWII. French POWs in a Stalig camp throw a wine party after accumulating wine. Resistance figures siphon off wine from casks bound for Germany. Bad wine is sent to the German occupation authorites. Collaborators sell the drink to the German authorities. Jews are hidden in the vineyards. These are all stories included in this short book.The concept of this book was interesting. This collection of stories does not lead to a very coherent book, although many of the stories are very interesting. This is more of a fluff book, unless you are interested in wine."
2,"Great summer read, yes! Great historical book, no . . .","If you are ""into"" wine, this is a great summer read. You'll have heard of most (if not all) of the major wine estates (if not people) mentioned, and it's a diverting, enjoyable story, especially if read with a glass of the appropriate wine. BUT if you are looking for serious historical facts . . . forget it! This is ""history-lite"" and contains too many factual errors to be taken as History."
1,very multi cultural,The music is very multi cultural so if that's your pleasure you will love it. It was not what I was looking for but the one song I wanted was on it so I got it.
4,Song,I really enjoyed this CD but I especially enjoyed the song It's Not Over Till God Said It's Over. I found that to be very helpful to me during a time when I was goind through something.
5,Great test automation book!,"Using Visual Basic, one of the most economical language platforms (in terms of cost and learning curve), Mary Sweeney guides us through the world of automated software testing. I found this book to be well documented, clearly written and easily accessible by a beginner like me. There are useful examples and tester's tips throughout the book that help me understand the key concepts. The added essays are particularly insightful for someone new to the field of software testing. This book is a great reference and a solid springboard for software testing. I highly recommended."
3,poor book with limited examples,"I wanted this book to help me write automated ADO tests, it provides an introduction to VB with lots of waffle about testing and lots of articles about how to be a better tester. I wanted concrete examples of how to create automated test suites etc. If you test mostly through the GUI, this might be of some use."
3,this is not the coffey i remember...,"see when i think dennis coffey i think of his raunchy funk strumming, clever leads, and just an overall jive to his playing... this album leaves me with non of that... he must have been floating in the old days, and now is all grown up... dont get me wrong if you looking for somethin smooth and relaxing this is your album... great guitar playing... and he still always plays the right thing at the right time... but this is more of an album to put on if you having cocktails with a classy lady... if you need some mojo with the older ladies this is your album... i just was hopin for some more raw and energetic funk... you may dig it... the playin is extremely tight... just not my bag..."
5,Better than Whitney My Love!,"I've read this book more than once and it's one of the few romances that's left an impression on me. It's my absolute favourite! I think what makes it SO good is the characters especially Stephen! He's my dream man! Judith McNaught does a wonderful job of making you fall in love with him and Sheridan. I loved every single part of the book, except when Stephen was angry with Sheridan because he thought she lied to him. By the way, that seems like kind of a trend with Judith Mcnaught, having the heroes think that the heroines are brilliant actresses who lied to them? Anyway, all I gotta say is do not pass this one up! It will make you laugh and cry, and if you like it read Whitney My Love too (although in my opinion it's not as good). However Stephen is so adorable in it!"
3,disappointing,There are more than 100 reviews already for this book but I had to share my take on it because I was kind of disappointed with this one. It does not have the same depth as other McNaught stories. The book also seemed overcrowded with appearance of too many previous characters. After reading about them in intense stories I personally found it hard to accept them in merely supporting roles.
3,Rather Dull,"This book was rather slow, and the characters were not intense. Granted, most love stroies are unrealistic, this one was too much so."
4,"now change up, please...","""JM"" is a good romance writer but i think she must think other category not based on routines"
2,Highly Unsettling,"What supposedly courageous, poised, and confident heroine marries a man who doesn't use sex and intimacy to show he cares about her but to manipulate her into doing something she doesn't want to do?! Especially one who ""makes love"" to her as a form of revenge? Yeah, supposedly he's tender and causes her to enjoy herself, but it was awfully close to rape for my piece of mind! However, Sherry seems perfectly happy to go ahead and marry him. At least the ""getting-to-know-you"" scenes in the first half of the book were sweet."
2,It's Deja-Vu all over again!,"I love the early McNaught books, but her more recent titles are just rehashes of the older titles.This is a perfect example. If you want to know the plot, just read Whitney, My Love and you basically have it. Her early books (Whitney, Once & Always, Something Wonderful) are the pinnacle of her romance writing. All of the other titles are reworks and variations of these three. Don't get me wrong, she's a great writer, and they are all good reads, but I become frustrated with writers who make more money than I'll ever see basically re-writing and re-releasing the same 3 books, over and over again! Stick with the original 3, they're the best!!!!"
2,Same old formula,"My problem with this book is that it so closely followed the same formula as the first Judith McNaught book I read, Whitney My Love. I actually very much liked the Stephen character and wanted it to work out between them, but the amnesia thing was a little unbelievable and then what happens when she regains her memory was totally silly. I had a big problem with the way Stephen treated her when they did get back together (because he once again believed something that someone said without talking to Sheridan... that seems to be Judith McNaught's go-to plot line) and then when he finally wises up and comes to her she just takes him back with no questions asked and that's that. I've read two of Judith McNaught's novels and don't have any plans to read more."
4,Sherry forgives too easily,"I have recently purchased this book after borrowing it from the library; overall, it was a well written book. Although I have to say that Sherry was too naive and forgave too easily. I have not yet read ""Whitney, My Love"", but by judging the reviews, I might not even read at all. I have to to say that ""Until You"" was one of Judith McNaught's better novels.I have noticed that many of Judith McNaught books, many heroines, actually all of them, are too soft heart and too forgiving."
4,Brilliant...but...,"The only reason I donot rate Until You in 5 stars is the ending plot. From the first page, the story soared to when Sheridan was rebuked by her almost bethroted. And... I stil cannot comprehend it... just that it fell kind of flat to the end. An exciting flat but suddenly Judith couldn't wait to finsh the story. I was hoping for the heart wrenching conciliation between the hero and the heroine, but I guess it is because Judith respect the heroine's too strong character that the ending to be just that. Want to know?? Read it.. trully it's a beautiful story and you might not think it is flat at the end..."
4,just what i needed,this book was good the begining was kind of slow. after i really start reading it i couldn't put it down!! it was one of them books that moved my heart. the very end kind of dissapointed me! but all in all it was a good read!
2,Not one of her Best work,"I have read almost every one of her novels and have loved them all, except this one. I was bored with the storyline and unimpressed with the characters. If you wanna good novel read Whitney, My Love, Kingdom of Dreams or Almost Heaven. They are far better novels."
2,A true disapointment,"I have read Perfect and Paradise and they are fantastic books, but this one was a real disapointment. The story was lacking and when finaly there was some suspens the story was rushed so fast to the end that you were left wondering what happened. I am still a great fun of Judith McNaught but I will defenitely think twice about buying more of her historical romance."
2,Dissapointed,"This book was a dissapointment after reading all the great reviews for it I was expecting a really good read. But it turned out that the characters did not have hardly any chemisrty between them at all. The most interesting part was hearing about the characters from Sheridan's past. This is my first Judith Mcnaught book and I will probably give her another try and read another of her books. Until You, has it moments when it is good, but i wouldn't recommend reading it unless your very bored and there's no other books around"
5,Dreamy !,"Untill You is one of McNaught's best. It transports the reader into a romantic and exciting fantasy world filled with tears, laughter and suspence. Any one who enjoys reading romance novels should not miss this one"
4,Good,"This romance novel was good- it's style is very different than the usual romance, so it was refreshing to read. It was more like just a fiction novel, with the other romance ""aspects"" added. Yes, compared to the usual romance novel, it was quite different in how it was written, but that just made me like it more. It's worth reading."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE BOOK,"If you enjoyed ""Whitney My Love"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" you will be most disappointed by this very bad Judith McNaught. All of the smiles and joy that the other two envoked were shattered by this novel that was rushed and cheesey! Yes, Whitney and Clayton are in this book as is Steven, but they are not the same characters from ""Whitney My Love."" Steven is now bitter... complete 180 from his original character... and part of a far fetched, unromantic plot that is neither believable nor up to typical McNaught standards. I was most disappointed in this ""sequal"" that was a complete let down from the happy feelings of its predecessor!"
4,Very nice.....,"I've just finished reading this book (my first Judith McNaught book), and I must say that it was very nice. It was funny, romantic, and would definately make you cry. It was incredibly romantic and emotional when Stephen admitted his love for Sherry. This book it a keeper."
4,Now I know Judith is NOT perfect!,"I am a huge fan of Ms. McNaught's and I have read all of her historicals. I truly believed Judith to be incapable of writing a less than perfect novel. Well, my bubble just burst. I just finished ""Until You"" and I was very surprised. The first 100 (or so) pages were completely and utterly boring! I was tempted so many times to put this book back on the shelf and not pick it up again. I had to force myself to keep reading. I am happy to say that it did pick up as soon and Clayton and Whitney showed up and it did have a good ending so I gave it 4 stars however, The family thing was a little far out there but hey, nobody's perfect even though I was beginning to think Judith was. This one is not bound for the keepers shelf but ""A Kingdom of Dreams"", ""Almost Heaven"", ""Once and Always"", ""Whitney my Love"" and ""Something Wonderful"" will be there to eternity."
4,Enjoyable,"Most romances with amnesia in them I skip over because the plot is so typical. But having read Judith McNaughts books before I gave it a try. It was the best one I read with amnesia, but I liked Whitney my Love best. But overall I liked it."
3,It Was Okay,"I have read a few stories by Judith McNaught and have come to the conclusion that they all have the same plot elements wrapped in a slightly different package. A rich, cold-blooded hero; a book-smart, guileless, sickening sweet heroine; and a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING. The big misunderstanding is usually a mistake on the hero's part, and he treats the heroine like dirt until he realizes he was wrong and then he tries to get the heroine back. In a nutshell, this is pretty much all there is to Until You. Except in previous stories there is more interaction between the hero and heroine to make the reader believe that something special exists between them. Not so in Until You. The only thing I saw between them was physical attraction. It makes for an okay story, but something I had to skim through a lot and not something worth remembering."
2,Not what I expected.,"I am a fan of JM but she fell short on this novel. After reading and enjoying 'Whitney, my love' and 'A Kingdom of Dreams'; {along with most of her other books; all in which I have enjoyed} I had high expectations for this one and I was very disappointed. I didn't like the fact that he never says I LOVE YOU once to her. That was a big turn off for me."
3,So-So,"I usually love books by Judith McNaught, but this one was not one of them. I bought it with the expectation of it being as wonderful as Whitney, my love. I thought it was nowhere near as good. Usually her books make me laugh and cry for the characters and I can hardly put them down. This one took me forever to get through. I even thought the references to Clayton and Whitney were lacking."
5,Simply Magnificent.,"This book made me laugh, made me weep, made my heart twist and I just could not put it down until I finished it.Whitney, My Love was the first romanctic novel I ever read and I loved it. A great sequel to Whitney, My Love. It lives up to the expectations, I certainly was not dissapointed.This is the second novel I read from Judith McNaught and it definitevely puts her among my favorites authors with Nicole Jordan and Stephanie Laurens. I can't wait to read more of her books, specially the story of Nicky DuVile.I absolutely recommend it."
4,Not the best,"I thought that this book, while good, didn't measure up to McNaught's other novels. Usually I can read one of her books in one sitting but this one seemed to take so long to take off. Once in the middle it was impossible to fall in love with the charaters. So while this was good, it wasn't the best."
5,A really touching reversal of roles...,"Isn't it nice when characters you've loved and read about in other books meet each other in one book? Well, that's what happens here and it was great learning about their lives after they ended up together. They all contribute to the love story of Sherry and Stephen, specially Whitney! Marvelous. And, of course, another happy ending. Wouldn't we wish that love could truly be this way? I hope, though, that UNTIL YOU is not the last in the story of those characters I've mentioned and that I will meet them again later, in another novel by Ms. McNaught. I'm on tenterhooks anticipating it!"
2,A CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENT!,"As someone who has read everyone of Ms McNaught's books, I was frankly disppointed by ""Until You."" Not only was the book less involved then all of her previous works, the narrative was overly simple, the plot unoriginal, and the characters grossly underdeveloped. The trick of bringing together everyone in her previous novels is also lame beyond words. If this is what her works have degenerated into- and after reading ""Until You,"" ""Remember When,"" and ""Night Whispers,"" it's no wonder I am beginning to have serious doubts about her works- maybe it's time I stopped buying her books without first checking them out from the library."
2,"A Repeat of Whitney, My Love","If you liked Whitney, My Love, make sure you don't read Until You too soon after it. You will basically be reading the same story over again. I was disappointed by the repeat occurrences in this story (the horse tricks, the bathtub scene, etc.). The ending, with everyone from Sherry's past reunited again was corny. And I just couldn't get over the fact that Stephen never said ""I love you"" to Sherry. I waited the whole story for those words, but they never came. It left it feeling like the story was incomplete. I'm sorry, but I'm a hopeless romantic, and that just ruined it for me."
3,just ok,"I love Judith McNaught's writing - Whitney my Love, Kingdom of Dreams they all were great and I think thats because you really felt the love they had for each other. Unfortunetly I felt that the heroine loved the hero more. And at the end of the book he was just cruel and then two pages later relizes he made a mistake and says sorry and she forgives him, no begging no goveling - personally I like alittle groveling but overall it was a ok read, just not one of here bests."
1,Awful,"This book made me wonder if there isn't a conspiracy to brainwash fans of the genre into loving even the basest and down-right ridiculous romance stories. This was so bad. Please save your money and your time and bypass this hooey.A man isn't a catch simply because he's rich and handsome.Judith, here's a challenge. Make a list of 10 favorable human characteristics and try applying more of them to your men. Maybe I'll start reading your books again."
3,SO SO,"Some of this story was frustrating! Her memory loss lasted too long. His emotional state of ""guilt"" was frustrating. How much can one person take of feeling quilty over an accident?"
1,The book was horrible,I thought the book was a complete waste of time. I have never been so disapointed by a judith mcnaught book.
1,Drab...,"In the beginning, this story was a little confusing, which was a great feat considering how boring it was. I simply disliked everything about this one. Stephen and the rest of the characters were unappealing and not delightful in the least."
4,Definitely worth it,Stephen and Sherry are very appealing characters. I loved how Sherry thaws Stephen from his icy existence! Loved their last scene together. It would have been great to have had some more interactions togteher at the end but all in all another can't put it down book!
1,Cruise Ship Squeeze - a biased book!,"Very biased and exaggerated opinion by the author. Those of us who have worked on ships (including the bowels of the vessel) know that it is hard work as with most jobs in life, but certainly not the horrible scenarios referred to in the book. Cruise lines are no different to multinational land based companies operating in developing countries."
5,Exellent,"Excellent book for who wants to know how the cruise industry is. Learned a lot. However, from Chapter 6 and on, if I am not mistaken, the writer expose him self to much on his opinion on how much he dislikes the cruise industry. I mean, there are environmental concerns in every industry and the cruise ships have improved a lot. Now, to spend time reading emergencies situation on board and how the big cruise lines plans everything to take advantage over passengers and ports, just in order to make the cruise industry to look bad!? No reasone for that at all. For improvements, we need to say the actual facts and not judge it before, and put it in to words to fit it in to the picture us one would like it to be. I do recommend to anyone to buy this book, you wont regret. Lot's of detailed information there that no one would find in any other book. And I've read over 6 books about cruising."
1,defective,Motor burned out within 5 minutes of use. Took it to a Dewalt dealer and he happily replaced the motor. I'm hoping it won't happen again.
4,Crash Course: A Self-Healing Guide to Auto Accident Trauma a,"This book provides practical and powerful information about the process of healing trauma. Dr. Diane Heller's focus is auto accident recovery, but the exercises explained in the book could be used to recover from trauma of any kind. The use of analogy and the author's clear writing make this book easy to understand and to use. Though debilitating, the symptoms of trauma can sometimes be subtle and hard to recognize as being related to the traumatic experience. It is good there is a book available that can help people recognize their symptoms and help heal them in a gentle, compassionate and effective way. Dr. Heller's methodology is unlike psychotherapy which requires the patient to re-experience the trauma by repeatedly re-telling the story. She has developed a profoundly effective method which heals without retraumatizing. I highly recommend this book - it can ONLY help."
5,A powerful tool,"We found this book extremely useful in a practical day-to-day manner. Offering clear and direct instructions on what to do, and when and how to do it, Crash Course leads one through the healing process in a way never available to the public before. The simplicity and yet power of this book, and its ability to help one enact positive (and not re-traumatizing) change makes it a treasure for anyone who has been in an automobile accident."
5,Great help for PTSD sufferers,This book hits home for those who suffer the long term affects of auto trauma...and other traumas as well. HIghly recommended.
2,Low calibre battery,This battery doesnt have much stamina at all. It's fine for driving small screws but if you intend to do anything heavier such as drilling with a spade bit or driving a quantity of long screws you will need a battery with a larger capacity. I suggest you opt for a battery with at least 2.0ah.
3,"LIGHT IS great, experience was just okay","For Amateur video fans, this light is PERFECT for lighting a green screen. My only bad experience wasn't with Amazon, but with the partner distrubutor ADORAMA, which send it out with a FRENCH plug. I sent it back and bought it at B&H. Sorry, but the vendors have to be more careful. dd"
5,A great ending to a great series,"This episode marks the end of the great title, the outlaw star, and in a way is the beginning of somethign greater. Besides episode 23, which was unusually high in slapstick, the entire DVD set was action packed, and awesome. If you liked the first two, you won't be disappointed by the conclusion."
3,A rushed ending to a pretty good series...,"Outlaw Star is good fantasy/sci-fi, it also has some comedy in it. Collection 3 contains two discs and the last eight episodes. It deals with all the loose ends that were accumulated through-out the series. Though the ending was rushed it did leave closure, but at the same time they left room to make a sequal, should they choose too.I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it was rushed compared to the earlier episodes. The animation wasn't all that good, but it wasn't bad. The story, however, was excellent. This is a good series for fans that want a good blend of just about everything."
2,Disappointed,"As others have said, some of the knives had cracks in the handles. The plastic handles also look cheap. Stay away."
4,sweet set of knives,"Great knives, much better than what I was using, i had the cracked handles as well on three of the knives, but I am super happy with them regardless. I contacted Cuisanart about it, and will see how hard it will be to get replacments for teh cracked ones."
3,So so knife set...,"This knife set is one that will basically get the job done. However, it's a great replacement for my previous set! The only problem we've had is the cracked handle on two of the knives."
2,Cracked Handles,"Most of the knives have small cracks by the round metal circles on the handles. They are not overly noticeable, however, it makes you wonder how much use you will get out of them before the cracks become too large, and/or the handle itself breaks - which could be dangerous if you are in the process of cutting something."
4,Great starter set,The knives (including the steak knives) are extremely sharp. The steak knives seem thin but work great. It also seems that the types of knives each set has is a little bit random. Amazon has also mislabeled these knives. They're high carbon stainless steel not just stainless steel. For $70 its great.
4,CUISINART KNIFE SET,Can't believe such a great set of knives came at such a low price. Selection of knives is excellent as are knives. Very happy with them!
3,My set was barely acceptable,"We had multiple small cracks in handles they were visably discernable yet not as bad as others had mentioned. I think the sellers should pull this item or sell it ""as is"" at a lower price. We got lucky and our set was in far better quality than the other posters. I dont share the sentiment that the construction quality was low, I feel they are quality knives with questionable handle material."
1,very unhappy,"I BOUGHT 3 SETS OF THESE AND GIFTED FRIEND AND FAMILY.EVERYBODY COMPLAINING, THE ALL THE KNIFE'S HANDLE GOT CRACK AND GETTING BIGGER CRACK. I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY."
3,decent after sharpening,"I have bought 2 sets of these knives. For the price they are great. It's a crap shoot as to whether they are properly sharpened, however. I had to sharpen half of both sets. They do sharpen to a minor razor edge, without much effort. I have not polished the edge to see just how sharp they can get... There can be some imperfections but generally everything was acceptable with fit and finish ( considering the price ) These are everyday use knives and quite a collection at that! The small santuko is my favorite. I use the steak knives as utility knives. As with ANY knife, DO NOT put in the dishwasher. Simply wipe them off or clean them with dishwashing soap and IMMEDIATELY dry them and put them away! This will properly care for any knife and make it last for generations. Remember, it's a tool and must be cared for or it will not perform properly when you need it!"
3,these will do,"Certainly not the best knives on the market, but for the price point they are very good. This would be a nice starter set. They keep a good cutting adge and look stylish on the counter. As your income and kitchen savvy increase you can invest in higher quality, but these will do the job."
5,A gushing review by a usually cynical buyer,"I, too, was wary about purchasing this set after reading the negative reviews but decided to take a chance so as not to miss a great one-day holiday sale price. Now my only regret is that I didn't buy MORE sets as gifts for family and friends!Shipping was lightning fast (especially for the xmas season), every piece arrived in perfect condition and, so far, these are the best knives I've ever used. I couldn't be happier with them and would gladly order them again."
4,Cuisinart knife set,"The purpose of this review is to tell you that the knives are a good investment. When I bought them the reason was the color and the price reduction at Christmas, I like red. But when I started using them I found them to be sharp and able to keep an edge. The only drawback is that you cannot leave them in the sink damp they will stain and tarnish. This is the way with any good carbon steel knife. All in all I would buy another set when the price gets to the one that I bought at just for spares."
1,Very poor quality. Terrible handles.,"I was so excited to find these knives on sale for $49.99, but that excitement was short-lived. When I unwrapped the knives I thought the plastic of the handles looked a little strange, and on closer inspection I found there were small cracks at the rivets on many of the knives. I knew these tiny cracks would only get bigger with use, so I returned the set to amazon for a replacement. But when I received the replacement set, I found that one of the knives had a big crack all the way through the handle; back again to amazon for a replacement. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong! More like three strikes, you're out! Once again, one of the knives had a big crack in the handle. So, I gave up and just sent the knives back to amazon for a refund. Obviously, these are just some really poorly made knives. Don't waste your time."
1,Mine were cracked too.,"I guess one of these days I'll learn to believe the reviews. My set came with multiple cracked handles. One was cracked completely across. I was also missing knives. The large chef and small santoku were nowhere to be found while there were two of the large santoku. As others have mentioned, no reply from Cuisinart so I am returning the set. There needs to be better quality control."
1,Very low quality for the price,"There are several reasons for the low rating. First of all, when I first ordered this beautifully looking (on the picture) set I was surprised to see quite different color of the handles when the knifes were unpacked. It not as bright red as pictured, but very dull color. Secondly, some of the knives were defective - curving blades, deep scratches and minor cracks on the handles. The set was exchanged by Amazon quick and without any hassle. The replacement set was slightly better, but still not perfect. The main complaint right now is rusting. You basically have to wash and dry the knives immediately after use, otherwise they will get covered with rust spots really quick - this is what happened to one of my knives after I left on the table for a few hours after slicing a tomato. It's a huge hassle to do, especially if you are cooking a big dinner and use a lot of knives. Unfortunately, I have to strongly recommend staying away from this set."
4,"Not so good, but for the right price...","The knives are not the quality you would normally expect from Cuisinart. Steak knives are thin, bent and overall crappy. I received 4 steak knives and 4 extra 4.5"" utility knives, which are much better quality. That and the price I paid ($70) were the reasons I did not send the set back."
1,Overall Poor quality,"I was very disappointed in these knives. While quite sharp, the steel was *very* thin. They don't have enough weight to be a good chopper, plus chopping anything makes me nervous that the blade will shatter. Every single one of them rusted after being run through the dishwasher. It did come right off with a couple swipes of an abrasive pad, but had I left the dishwasher full while on vacation I'd have had to use a lot more elbow grease. I would definitely not buy these knives a second time."
1,Rusted & Cracked,After just one was in the dishwasher (Top Shelf)All of the knives started to rust.The main chopping knife's handle also cracked in the dishwasher as well.I'm very unhappy with this product.Knives are sharp though.
1,cracked knifes,Got my knife set day before. It contained the entire set. 3 knives were cracked out of the box. I have asked for a replacement and hopefully the new set turns out better.
1,not such a slick deal after all...,"Just got item, two knives had cracked handles and no cutting board came with it. I called cuisinart and instead of just returning the two broken knives to them (they would charge me shipping both ways even defective) they said it was best to send back to amazon. It seems like a great set for the price assuming nothing is cracked out of the box so I will be getting a replacement set and we'll see how it goes. Based on other reviews it seems like a roll of the dice as to if your set will come in one piece."
1,READ REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING!,"Yep, I bought these on black Friday special for $35 without reading the reviews. Couple hours later, still stoked from my great deal, I read the reviews. Not wanting to miss out on a great price, I saw the Pinzon knives also on sale and bought those. Glad I did...My Cuisinart knives are cracked as well. SUCH a disappointment.I already have a 5 inch Cuisinart santoku knife (purchased from BB&B;) that I LOVE. I haven't had any issues with that one. I compared mine with the one that came with the set, and you can CLEARLY see the difference in quality. I suspect that the Amazon set was made by another manufacturer with little quality control. The Amazon set has cracks, black dings and there was even a sliver of the plastic in one of the baggies.I still like the Cuisinart brand, but will be more cautious next time.One other note: DO NOT put good knives in the dishwasher!"
4,A good upgrade,"We upgraded to this knife set from a cheap $20 target set. There is no comparison. All the knives are very sharp and cut much better than anything we've used before. While the steak knives are thinner than the other knives in the set, this has not been a problem. Despite feeling slightly flimsy, they have not bent and work very well. Unbeatable for the price."
1,Don't Buy This!,"I purchased this knife set as a gift for Christmas. When I got the knives, I opened them up and checked them out. Out of the 20 knives, 18 of them were cracked on the handle. One was cracked completely through. Cuisinart refused to help me and replace them. Definitely a poor product. Don't buy it!"
1,Don't risk it,I purchased this set when it was under $40.00 and thought it was worth the risk. It is not. My knives were also cracked and the blades are very thin and some were knicked. For the Cuisinart brand these are subpar. There is something to be said for a set of knives that can range in price to over $150.00 to under $40.00 in less two days. Buy another set.
3,Cracks on knife handles,"In the set I recieved, the plastic on the handle of the ""5.5-inch serrated knife"" has a crack of about 1.0 mm. This is the same case for 4 other knifes with a smaller crack.Other than that I have no other complaints. The quality of the knifes steel seems fine and the timing in the shipping was as expected."
1,Do not buy this set!,"My wife and I received this set as a wedding gift a couple years ago. In that time, nine of the handles have cracked, all in the same place: along the uppermost rivet. We tested one of these knives in the dishwasher, and since the color immediately faded, we have taken care to always wash these knives by hand. No matter. I'm not sure if it's exposure to water, or some other factor which causes them to crack, but these knives are absolutely awful and not worth a purchase.There really should have been a recall on these knives, as any knife with a propensity for indiscriminately cracking is a danger to the user."
1,Knives rusted in less than a month.,All of the knives in this set began collecting spots of rust after less than one month of use. Not sure how that happens as other stainless steel cutlery in our house is handled/washed the same way without problems. Would NOT recommend this set - spend a little more $ on Heinkel or Wustoff (sp).
1,handles crack,"I bought these on sale at Macy's a while ago. I too have noticed huge cracks at the rivets on the handle. They still work great but the cracks on the red handles are such an eye sore, especially with such a large set. I am very dissapointed because Cuisinart is usually such a good brand."
1,Do not Touch!! Cuisinart Cutlery is the pits...Literally!,"This is the worst Knife set I have ever purchased. Every single piece started rusting and pitting after the FIRST use. Extremely poor quality and no answere from Cuisinart. I am very disappointed because I own several Cuisinart appliances and am very pleased with them so I assumed the quality would carry over.WRONG!!!! If ever a knifeset should be recalled and all customers reimbursed...this is it.I implore AMAZON and every other retailer that offers these items for sale to discontinue. Cuisinart needs to stick to the appliance business and whoever manufacrutes that knives in China should be sued.Sincerely,Stephen Smith"
2,I am sorry I did not check out the reviews before I purchased.,"I am afraid to start to use the knife set. It said it was 18/8 stainless steel. 18/8 stainless is the highest quality stainless and will not rust. So if there is a rusting issue it is not 18/8 stainless as advertised. I also noticed a few hairline cracks radiating about 1/4 inch off the rivets on the larger knives. I also saw where people had purchased the sets on Amazon for less than $50. I paid $150, Caveat Emptor."
1,Not a good idea this time!,This product came cracked and badly broken. Still waiting for refund or replacement. This is the second cuisinart set that I purchased. The first set was fabulous and I would rate it 4 stars. That is why I ordered a set as a gift for my daughter. Imagine my dissapointment when she received damaged merchandise.
2,Rusty knives,These knives are rusting!!!!!!!!!!! They have managed to keep sharp. But......rusting from minimal use? This does not live up to the brand name.
4,Neat guitar but over priced if you buy it here.,"It is basically the same guitar as EZ-EG but without the tremelo and the UX-16 USB MIDI cable. Another neat thing about this guitar (besides being stringless) is that you can use it as a MIDI controller.I've been watching the price for this neat learning guitar on Amazon for a while now, but am disappointed that it is still way over priced ($249.99 at this moment) compare to other online retailers. Most online stores are selling this thing for under $200. The cheapest I've found (from musiciansbuy.com) was $195.95 including free shipping, Yamaha PA3C power adaptor, Stereo headphones and Two-year extended warranty. I hope Amazon will not only match but also beat that price soon so I can put this guitar in my wish list to show my wife what I want for Christmas."
5,E-Z,E-Z is the best thing to say about learning to play the guitar! You can down load other songs to learn to play! The sound effects are GREAT too!
1,ez on the fingers,"I just got this guitar, after buying it on line, it is wonderful after not thinking I would ever play again after so many years. I would still recommend guitar lessons, and a regular guitar for someone starting out, but this has been a real treat to play and is bringing some techniques back to me that I had forgotten for many years. I'll be using this guitar, and my old one as well, thanks for helping me rediscover my musical roots. It is just a joy to pick something up and play anything that you want and it even makes us old finger-pickers sound great."
2,why bother?,"just learn the real guitar, how stupid would you look pressing buttons that light up...believe don't bother!"
4,Afternoon pick-me-up,"When you need something to clear the cobwebs in your head, Victorian Inn Instant Cappuccino Mocha - two spoons and one spoon of hazelnut (or another flavor of your choice) into a cup of hot water does the trick. Lately I have added Nestle Coffee-mate Peppermint Mocha for a little extra special flavor. Amazon does a great job with their automatic refill of your order. Amazon notifies you ahead of shipment for the option to change, delay or delete your order. With confirmation, your order is shipped and you know exactly when to expect delivery. Great Service !!!"
5,YUMMY,"This is the greatest because it is like ""glorified"" hot chocolate...it is creamy and yummy, but NOT sweet! That is what I love about it...the perfect mix of chocolate with just a hint of coffee flavor!!"
4,A real superhero spoof,"A nice little 'cult' film. It is a more deadpan and less goofy version of ""Mystery Men"", which was funny, but never really lived up to its potential. This film is funny,with some nice, but inconsistant writing. The story is about very unheroic superheroes, and the realtivly banal lives they lead. If you expect them to go fight villans, you will be disappointed. In fact until the end, you never see them use thier powers. It is a very funny film, and a nice example of an odd and engaging film."
5,One of the best movies ever made! James Gunn is a writing GOD!,"This is the story of the world's 6th or 7th greatest super-hero teams, who've spent many days fighting crime and righting wrongs, today is not one of those days. That's the intro to the movie and from that time on it's non-stop laughs. This version of the movie contains the same specs as the orginal release but now with P. Brewster commentary, which means you need to buy it. James Gunn's dialog is dead on and hilarious, kind of like Clerks meets a good super-hero movie they haven't made yet. Heavy yet funny as crap dialog makes this one a multiple view for sure. I'll continue to buy this movie as long as it continues coming out witha specialer edition! Go buy it and then go see SLITHER!"
5,CULT CLASSIC,"First off. This New Anchor Bay Dvd does not seem to have enough new special features to warrant a purchase if you already have the old Pioneer version. But that one seems to be hard to find.This movie is a hidden gem. It is very low budget. But the dialouge Is genius. If you like Kevin Smith or Tarantino's dialouge, where people seem to ramble on about non sense, You will love this movie.This is what the horrible Mystery Men should have been. Even if you don't like superhero's you can enjoy this flick. The cast is fantastic.Just don't expect many special effects or X-Men type action. They mostly sit aroound and complain about their job like in Officespace.A must See"
1,The Specials don't travel well,"I remember being told that there were two kinds of funny: funny ha-ha, and funny peculiar. This film is the second kind.I've admired Rob Lowe as a comic talent since Illegally Yours, and there are signs here that he might have done better with a better script, better direction with more pace, and less self-conscious rattling away at the 'ha-ha' kind of funny; but he's not helped by a lack-lustre cast and jokes that just don't cross the Atlantic successfully. Perhaps it's the parochialism of the humour that makes this film feel so slow, but I'm afraid I was very disappointed, and will have to wait longer to see one of my favourite actors achieve the success he deserves in comedy."
1,"Pathetically worthless, not worth $1.00","I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. He said it was a funny, if off-beat ""Super Hero"" movie. He compared it to ""Mystery Men"". It even has several decent actors in it.It's not even good enough to be called ""garbage"". Its *NOT* funny - not at all. Worse, its a pointless tale that goes nowhere - nowhere at all. Its obvious that its in ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" low-budget territory - without even the redeeming features of ""being so bad its good."" Its just bad.At the very tail end of the film, they do a scene where the characters appear outside their ""headquarters"" (which is just an ordinary house in the suburbs). They use the absolute cheapest special effects possible for a brief moment as the character stands or poses. Other than talking, that is the ONLY display of any kind.Save your money - its not even worth a $1 rental."
1,Worst Superhero Movie Ever,"Superheroes that never use their powers are not actually superheroes. Instead, they are pretty much just regular people with regular problems, which makes this movie extremely booooorrrrrring. Where's the special effects budget? Nobody knows.Save two hours of your life, go read the Watchmen or Astro City graphics novels.What the heck were they thinking?"
1,Oh dear...,"Well, what can I say? I can guess that the other two reviewers are possibly on something. My overall impressions of this film were that is was poor to terrible. I had initially thought it was starting very slowly, then I realised it was over. I suppose I should be thankful that it was short.I'll grant the movie did have a few sharp observations on the superhero genre, but they were generally poorly executed and too few and far between. I'm sad to say this was a film that had potential but was effectively stillborn.I would love to write more about it but I do not want to spend more time on this review than the writer did on the script..."
1,PLEASE MAKE IT END!!!,"There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film attempts at being a parody dealing with a group of second rate superheroes known as the Specials.The plot, the dialogues, and the music are way beyond ""below average.""The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors! It is truly sad...The presence of Rob Lowe does absolutely nothing to improve this abomination.Rent or buy at your own risk. You have been warned!"
1,What a piece of Crap,"I picked up the specials looking to see some heroics or comedy or drama. What I got was a load of trash. This film is an uninspired attempt to make a ""superhero genre"" movie by people who have never seen, read, or heard of a comic book or a cartoon. The characters are abysmal, the dialoge stinks, and it seems the entire ""special effects"" budget was reserved for the last 2 minutes of the film.I kept waiting for something or anykind of plot to develop. This movie started poorly and got progressivly worse. Save your money and buy a copy of Mystery Men. This film made my all time 5 worst list of films, second only to ""YOR hunter from the future"""
2,"Cute, but can be hit or miss with a mercurial child","The story is cute and pretty straightforward: little lamb gets lost. Along the way, other creatures -- frog, mole, caterpillar, bear, squirrel -- offer suggestions on where to look for home. The book has the expected happy ending. The book is on very stiff paper, and should endure at least a week of chewing.What doesn't work is the squeak toy. I found it a bit obnoxious because it's either too stiff for a child to push or too lound. (It's a shame they couldn't make it go ""baaaaaaaa"" instead of squeak.)"
3,It's Okay,"Russell Mulcahy's Tale of the Mummy is okay. I thought they came up with an interesting and new concept for the Mummy. Instead of his corpse walking around and killing people, it's the clothes he was wrapped in that are doing the killing."
3,Good quick set up blower - no good vacuum,The blower portion works real well. The hose could be longer so as to not have to stoop at times. An extention wand would be great. The vacuum is useless since the impeller is blocked by a non-removable guard under the intake by a plastic cross. One small leaf blocked it immediately. I laughed at the size when I saw it but it works good for small quick jobs.
1,Cannot tune guitar,"We are forced to return this product after trying to tune the guitar with no success. We even brough it to a local recording studio to see if a professional could tune it for us and he informed us that this particular guitar cannot be tuned correctly. I guess if you just want it becuase it looks cool but do not plan on playing it, go ahead and buy it."
2,"way, way small",These shoes are adorable. Much cuter than I had expected. I thought they were perfect when I took them from the box. I usually where a 9 and ordered that. I put them on and they were way too small. I sent them back and reordered them in a 10 since they were so stinkin cute I had to try again. They came and once again were too small. I was amazed. I have decided to give up. Total bummer!
3,Sugar Women's smoking Cat Bird flat,"These shoes are precious! Great to look at. Everyone loved them at the office. Not the best construction but look at the price. They will be great in the spring, just not for walking."
2,"Cute but runs small and they don't last long, do not pay full price","I love Sugar brand shoes, but they do not last long enough to warrant the price. I got a great deal on these at Amazon, so if I get 6 months out of them I will be happy, not upset like with my Sugar Military Cats that I paid full price for. These also run WAY small. They ended up at Goodwill, unworn."
4,Sweet!,Pick this up on an impulse buy. Came on time and was exactly what i order. sounds great. couldn't give it the five cuz i found one cheaper at the local musician store. but would recommend to my friends
4,Fairly good,"I've only heard thirty second clips so far, but what I've heard is pretty good. ""Wonder Why"" has a really cool groove this time around. ""Oxygen"" is juiced up real nice! Some songs are a little too strange in their remix, though. The second remix (there is two remixes of two songs) of ""A Maze of Grace"" is too weird with its off-key singing, and ""Best Thing"" has too much of a techno/dance vibe to it.This is a very different album for Avalon. These songs are so different, that they could almost could as an entirely new album. Neat idea, although I must admit it comes across as simply an attempt at making more money. The album still sounds good, though, and I'll be buying it very soon!"
4,This is what I've been waiting for,"I'm so excited that Avalon is taking a step in this direction...fusing christian music and electronica...I have always been a huge trance fan.This CD has some amazing mixes on it, but it also has some that [stunk]. The CD does not have a consistant sound at all. Avalon should have stuck with more of a trance vibe like on ""oxygen"" and the Tiesto mix...THAT IS WHAT DREW ME TO THIS CD...AND THAT IS THE INNOVATION BEHIND THIS CD. If it weren't for those boring rap mixes, the CD would have been flawless.If you love Sasha, Digweed, and Oakenfold with a Euro Pop twist, this CD is for you...Some songs remind me of DJ encore."
2,Not the Best I have heard from Avalon,"I love Avalon's music, but I felt this CD is vastly overrated. For starters, the only song on this album worth listening to is Testify to Love. The other songs that are re-mixed sound loud and full of so much background music and beats, you cannot hear what Avalon is even singing! If you like music where its rock/pop and you can't hear the words of your favorite christian group, then this album is for you. If not, I would not recommend it. I will say that all of their other albums are MUCH better!"
2,shockingly horrible,"don't get me wrong, I long Avalon, they're one of my favorite groups, and I love a great beat but the sounds coming from this cd didn't go well with Avalon. It's all techno which isn't bad, I like techno, but all the songs sound the same. And the same sound doesn't sound good for every song they've decided to remix. About all the songs are over 6 minutes and in most of them they hardly sing at all. It sounds like thery're just playing around with the intraments in the recording studio. When I heard that this cd came out I just went and bought it because I've loved all of Avalon's stuff so far but next year I think I'll have to preview the cd before i buy it. This cd is only for those who love a monotonous techno sound. There's a warning label on this cd and rightfully so. Note: Make it last forever- is a shocker. It's all rap. Be sure you preiview this cd before you buy. On christianbook.com you can preview all the songs which is what I should've done before I got this."
2,Did this come from Avalon?,"I am the biggest Avalon fan on earth. I've always been impressed with their music quality, creativity, and message. This disc is the complete opposite. I'm disappointed by such lousy arrangements of songs that were great in their original form. I'm also a fan of techno/dance music, but these remixes are nothing but a headache. I can't stand to listen to them, and I can listen to anything!"
2,Avalon Remixed.,This is a remix of some of Avalons great songs. They kind of lose their Worshipfullness and I dont think they are as good like this. But if you are fans of electronic dance type music then this is a great album. Also for those that like this type of music this maybe a great intro to Avalons Music.
3,Hmm...,I don't have this book yet but I was wondering if someone could tell me if it is any good or not.
3,Informative,"I found this book to be difficult to read in that it is basically a compilation of journal articles on the subject. It has some good information for someone who is new to the concept of evidence-based social work practice, but it wasn't that user friendly."
5,Wonderful spanish instructional tool for kids (and adults),The DVD is a wonderful tool to teach kids spanish. I have learned so much while watching it with the kids. The songs are so upbeat and catchy that the family walks around singing them! Susy is amazing!
3,It was okay,"The book was okay. It keep me interested, but it is not like his work ""Adreneline"" and ""The Last Minute"". I was hoping that it would go along the lines of Sam Copra, the character in these two books.It was good, I will read more of his books."
2,Later books better,"I started reading Abbott by starting with Adrenaline, which was non-stop action. I couldn't wait to read the sequel, The Last Minute, which was equally good. I thought I needed to read some of his earlier books so decided to begin with early ones and move forward. This book is much slower without all the action. I'm having a hard time even getting through it."
5,Great Characters and Great Storyline,Everyone who has ever lived in a Southern town will relate to the characters and the relationships. This author is outstanding and just seems to get better with each book
3,Couple issues with this battery,"I ordered and installed this battery. The battery fits and works totally fine, but it is not the same as the battery pictured.The picture shows a Sanyo battery. Since Sanyo was the manufacturer of the battery in my iPod, I opted to pay a bit more for this battery vs. the others here on Amazon. But the actual battery was not from Sanyo, but from a company called Powersmart, I believe. It looked identical and ended up working fine, but it misleading to use this image.Second thing is that the price has more than doubled since I order it a week or two ago!! Yikes. I'm not sure what would cause that, but it puts this item into the ridiculous category as compared to other options.Given these points, I would strongly recommend saving $20+ and ordering one of the other available batteries."
1,"1..10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100","Though the pages are informative for a child to learn counting, but the book is disappointing as the counting is not exactly from 1 to 100. The counting goes from 1 to 10 and then with increments of 10 rather than 1. So after 10 it is 20, 30, 40.. 100."
4,Nice variety of items to count. Not just 100.,"They have done a good job grouping the objects in clusters so that the counting can be easier. I don't mind that they skip the numbers between the 10's. The benefit is each number, like 40, gets multiple objects that a child can count to 40, based on their interest. It's a good mix of pictures and objects and styles, so the child gets to develop their identification skills. There are plenty of other lists that you can make to teach a kid to count between 40 and 50."
1,there are far better counting bks for kids,"I ordered this book based on the cover since it looked like a good children's counting book. As an educator I would not recommend this book. The pictures often have random drawings (ex. 70 bees drawn next to 70 hot-air balloons, with the whole page stressing some random radio news).I also found the page for the number 10 very odd. Why does a children's counting book need to have a girl in a shower, half-clothed?? Furthermore, the drawing for the number zero is a totally unclothed child sitting on what looks like clouds forming zero. Artistic expression or not, as a parent I do not find these 2 mentioned drawings appropriate for children's books."
5,Differential calculus I & II - N. Piskunov,"Great books, very happy to own these original versions from 1980. The items shipped very fast, way faster than the estimation actually. They arrived extremely well packed and protected and I had absolutely no bad surprises when I opened the books. Used, but in great shape and no writing on it. Good points for the seller 10/10."
5,Awesome,"Awesome CD, was good from the beginning to the end. Although I don't consider this CD as good as the other one, but it was a good CD, I mean all the tracks were a hit on the radio back when I was in Puerto Rico. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes salsa and is looking for something new to listen to."
2,Just okay,"While the songs on this CD are quite good, it is not stellar. The music does not inspire you to stop and actually listen to it. It is too mild and rather unremarkable. I had hoped for Josh Groban/Vienna Teng quality sound and this CD did not deliver."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I would give this book less than one star if possible. It contains the FREE study guides, and nothing else. The CD rom has just a watered down version of the web site. The print is small and hard to use as a study aid. Just download the free study guide, and save youre money for a test."
1,Regents College Examinations 2001,"This book was not very helpful in preparing for the examines. There is only one examine per subject; however, there are references provided for follow-up studies. My opinion, This book is not worth the money."
1,pass on it,"Disjointed, stumbling, dreary.You get the sense of some talent, but the outcome seems ill-conceived.Save yourself some money and skip this one."
3,Cheesy Childhood Memories,"Looking back, this video is kind of cheesy. A bunch of kids tromping around the woods, singing about Jesus, introducing a city boy to the Smokies. I have to say, though, that I loved watching this sing-along when I was little. I watched it over and over. If you're a Christian parent, I guess this would probably be something nice and clean to let your kids watch, if you don't get too annoyed by it."
5,Your First Year As an Elementary School Teacher : Making the,"This is a fantastic book! I am a business professional looking to switching careers and go into elementary education, and this book was exactly what I needed to give me a heads up on what my first year as an elementary school teacher would be like. It's well-written, easy to read, and contains lots of tid bits of information that I never would have thought of! If you're considering elementary school teaching as a career, you have to read this book! I'm reading it now before I start my teaching licensure classes, and I'll read it again right before I start my first year of teaching. This book helped me to realize that I really do want to become a teacher."
5,Your First Year as an Elementary Teacher,"This book is truly a fine addition to the limited resources available to first year teachers. It not only gives excellent information on what to expect in your first year, but how to be successful in meeting these challenges. The practical solutions to the everyday issues of teaching are explained with humor as well as authority. The authors bring their experience as educators to the pages making this helpful book a sure winner that will greatly enhance the first year experience for teachers. I will use it and recommend it in my work as a student teacher supervisor."
3,"Okay, but not great","I ordered this along with Harry Wong's First Days of School as something to give my student teacher. I was not impressed with this book. For $7, get Harry Wong's.This book does contain some useful information, but it's an easy read, with really very little substance. Much of the information is common sense (like what supplies to keep at your desk, or how to make friends with the office staff). In most cases, this information is given out during student-teaching, college courses, or the district induction program. It contains very little in terms of setting expectations, dealing with crises, organization, etc.If you do choose to get this book, I hope it would be one of many you'd read."
2,Not the shoe I expected to get,"I am disappointed with these shoes. First, they run very wide. Second, the back strap is low and tends to slide off. I made as many new holes as possible to try to tighten them but still they slide off. Otherwise, the shoe is indeed comfortable. It looks high but actually it is not because of the platform."
3,NiCads - they still make these?,"NiCad batteries have had their day in the sun - it's sunset now. Not only do they have memory, their power output and charging speed is inferior to later battery technologies, and when they die and get tossed they are a heavy-metal hazard to the environment. We've moved beyond these things, high time to stop making them. I bought this one because I could not find a NiMH replacement for my 12-V Makita drill. I tried, believe me. AT (...) bucks a pop they're no bargain, either."
3,Dictionary,"This book is just a dictionary. I thought when purchasing it would be much more than a dictionary, but it was not. For someone who knows absolutely nothing about mechanics, it might be Okay. For me, it was a bad purchase, but not worth the effort of returning for credit."
1,Where is it?,"I'm STILL waiting to receive this item. Estimated date for delivery says I should have received it at least two days ago. I just wrote to the company and told them if I don't hear from them today I am going to cancel my order. Which sucks because I ordered this as a birthday gift for my nephew who is a Beatle fan and I am sure he would love it. I have never even received an e-mail from the company - which I usually do, telling me the status of the delivery or something! Amazon did e-mail me to say they never received an estimated delivery date from them and said if I replied to their e-mail it would be passed on to the company. Which I did. Still nothing. So I just contacted them again. BAD BAD way to do business."
2,booooooooooooooooring!,never assign your own book to your class and recite parapraphs with masturbatory pleasure. It's poor podagogy...
5,"Excellent, Powerful, Ushering","God has truly touched the production of this CD. It is clear that this CD was released for such a time as this...as it speaks prophetically and gives encouragement to the body of Christ as we stand in the greatest of times for the entire body. Some of my favorite cuts include: The Best is Yet to Come, I Can't Complain, The Prayer of Jabez, and Usher Me.This album features the best in urban funk and lush vocals, yet is not absent in total praise and worship.If you haven't already purchased this CD, do so immediately, as it an experience that you don't want to miss. You will be blessed INDEED!"
5,Can't Stop Playing it!,"Well, Well, Well! there are no real words to say about this album. It's AWESOME!!! Especially: The Best is Yet to Come!, Bless Me (Prayer of Jabez), Usher Me and Go Get Your Life Back.All of these songs are top on my list of repeats :) Can't stop playing this CD, it's just AWESOME!!!"
3,I am still waiting for the Best,"This album was definitely ok and disjointed at times. Definitely not the best. Donald Lawrence and the Tricity Singers have strong vocals, but the songs do not give justice to their voices. If you are Donald Lawrence fan, you will like this CD, I guess but if you are not..do not bother. Find praise and worship elsewhere."
5,Beyond Expectations!,We love that Donald Lawrence special sound. The message comes through! This music grows on you. I would buy more of his CDs. A friend taught us some creative movement to express the words. Very effective use in church service.
3,Donald Lawrence not at his very best,"I have been a Donald Lawrence fan since he came out with A Songwriter's Point of View. I have purchased all of his work. This latest album misses the mark for me. I am used to the amazing vocals (both the sound and the gymnastics), but this album really features quite a few solos. I prefer the group sound. Don't get me wrong. Bless Me (The Prayer of Jabez) is truly a blessing, but it is really the only one that I just cannot go without listening to. If you want to hear him at his best, get Bible Stories; that is some great music from beginning to end."
5,THE BEST HAS ARRIVED!!!,"Donald Lawrence is one of the most recognized names in music and his new CD, ""Go Get Your Life Back"" shows why. This album shows off Donald's great singing, songwriting and production talents(some of the best talents in the music industry, period!!), it also gives the Tri-City singers a platform to display their wonderful vocal abilities.The album's central message is to incourage those who are going through tough times with the promise of God's blessings and provisions. The album has a wonderful blend of upbeat and funky songs to more melodic and tranquil material to soothe the soul. I would highly recommend this album to anyone out there seeking to uplift God and in return being uplifted themselves."
4,Good Scale,"I like the look of the Newline Elegant Digital Glass Kitchen Food Scale.It works well and is easy to use. I wish there was a way to turn it off as there is a clock on it. I'm not sure why I would need a clock on my kitchen scale but there's not way to turn it off unless you take the battery out.Also, if I was to purchase another kitchen scale, I would make sure it came with a bowl to put the food in as opposed to a flat surface.All in all, it's a good product and does what it says it does."
5,Nice Travel Charger,"This charger works just great and at the price, I just leave it in my travel bag so it's always with me when I am on the road."
1,Quality unassured,"I bought ""NEW Home Charger Cell Phone for Samsung SCH-u650 Sway""NEW Home Charger Cell Phone for Samsung SCH-u650 SwayOn the very first use, after the phone was fully charged, my wife attempted to unplug the charger from the wall outlet. She pulled it straight out from the wall, pulling on the adapter body (NOT THE CORD) as you should. The bottom plate seperated and an arc-flash ensued. Needless to say, she is upset after the close call and possibility of electrocution. I examined the device and although I did discover a single screw in the bottom plate,... there was no corresponding socket for it to thread into. That's right, the screw was met by unobstructed open space, therefore it was holding nothing. I guess you get what you pay for. By the way, I worked professionally in the electricity and electronics fields since 1977. I know a manufacturer's defect when I see it, especially one of this magnitude."
3,not bad,"This is frankly not the strongest EP I've ever heard, certainly not as good as forbidden love. All is full of love is good on one level (it's a damn good song) but also disapointing in that the band didn't really do anything too creative with it. still a good listen though.of the originals I found 20th century towers more enjoyable than stability. stability is the first time I ever found myself growing impatient with a deatcab song.bottom line, not an essential EP"
3,The songs are the key.,"I was very curious about this cd and almost picked it up in a store. I decided to check it out online (where I purchased it after streaming a bit) instead. The main offering ('Oceana') was immediately forgettable. It had some interesting sounds but nothing that sticks with you. I still sometimes will play it as something to have on, as some of the rhythms are fun. The main piece is followed up with Kronos Quartet playing a two movement quartet entitled 'Tenebrae'. Initially I was really drawn to this piece. I still like it very much. Its slow and sombre. Not for every mood, but skillfully played and recorded. The three songs, as sung by Dawn Upshaw, are what really shine here. Especially the third one.In closing I would recomend this cd, so long as you understand it is a mixed offering."
5,Gorgeous Embracing Experience,"This is a gorgeous experience, musically, poetically. There is the presence of a great artist -- working with exceptional vocal and instrumental artists and deriving word/image focus from passionate tender rough vibrant poetry and song - that embraced me in a transcendent yet life affirming experience. The roots and yearnings of a people in their culture, their land, their oceans, their traditions, their generations, made personal - speak through. The fine abstract elements create a new universe in which to experience what is essential, unalloyed, rich. I am with this body of work as if it were a great living love in my life. In truth, it is.Osvaldo Golijov: Oceana"
1,Floppy Disks!!!!!!,"This game looks like a lot of fun, but when it arrived there were floppy disks instead of CD's. I don't think anyone can even use floppy disks anymore because computers nowadays don't have floppy disk drives. I wish I had known before but at least now you know."
5,Track Listing,1. Querer Tu Amor2. Como Quisiera3. La Ultima Vez4. Ojitos Color Cafe5. Mujer6. Es el Amor7. Ella No Sabe8. Otra Noche Mas Sin Ti9. Pero Te Voy a Olvidar10. Que Pensabas
5,G. Washington- Great history teacher,"I bought GW for my 4 year old grandson. George arrived quickly after ordered and is very professional looking. Just as he would have been in life. His dashing looks and the paraphernalia included-pistol,sword, telescope, and the great box- are very conducive to teaching and playing sessions, which will be rife with questions-so bone up on your early American history. My grandson loves heros, and I plan to introduce him to a real American superhero."
4,Enjoyable Read,"While some of the situations were predictable, it was still a good, fast and interesting read."
5,This story was magical!,"My daughters and I loved this book. So, did my book club. Senator Thomas and President Marie Arcola were wonderful characters. We can't wait for the sequel. Rhonda."
5,Very Good!,"I loved the style this author used to tell this story of Americas first woman president. This was no Cinderella story with happy endings; this story tells the cold, hard truth. I've noticed Elizabeth Dole is on the news talking about running for president in the year 2000. I honestly believe a lot of what goes on in Lady President will come true."
5,IS AMERICA GOING TO HAVE A WOMAN PRESIDENT IN 2000?YES!!!,"I was very impressed by the style of this authors writing and I am surprised it arrived, just when Elizabeth Dole announced she will run for president in the year 2000. And guess what? She is going to win! This marvelous story of what America can expect once we have our first woman president is clever, fast-paced and a heart warming dedication and inspiration to women in politics. Look at the top, power politicians in Arizona. ALL OF THEM ARE WOMEN! Lady President is more than a romantic, political thriller- IT IS A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE! Abortion laws, gun control, federal laws crossing into state laws over the internet and gang riots in America. These are the things Elizabeth Dole and our communities will have to deal with. This author is onto something. He is ahead of the game. Where's the sequel? Or is the sequel, once Mrs. Dole becomes President Elizabeth Dole? Stay tuned."
5,Lady President gets my vote!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am so glad I found this Lady President novel. My sister and our book club loved it. President Marie Arcola was brilliant ( and Senator Trevor Thomas wasn't to bad either ). We loved the 'bad boy, bad girl' line of characters and the great story with all the realistic, anti-government subplots. This book was a lot better than what Tom Clancy is coming out with. This book is also very timely since Elizabeth Dole is running for president. I hope President Dole is as tough as this Lady President."
4,Good For Tight Spots Where You Need a Broadcast Light,"This is a pretty handy little light, although I admit I use it more when working on vehicles and airplanes than my house. The cool light emitted by the flourescent bulb is easier to manage than a beam light. However, it is really only useful within three feet of the flashlight. The battery will last two hours, but the light slowly dims over that time, especially in the last half hour. I would probably buy another one if this one ever dies - it uses the same batteries as the 7.2 volt drill."
1,A poor representation of historic events,"Civil War Battlefields - Gettysburg / Wilderness / Spotsylvania / AppomattoxI watched this DVD, hoping for an inspiring portrayal of this significant part of U.S. history. What I found was a boring film.Its only salvation was the importance of the subject matter. I assume it was historically accurate, but the graphics were repetitive in both discs, and the narration was dull and ponderous, particularly by the persons filmed . It is an interesting subject, but these DVDs don't do it justice. There must be a better source. Duane R. Kullberg"
1,civil war battle fields,The worst film on the history of the civil war i have ever seen.Do not waste your time our money.
5,2nd Try at getting Corelle Creamer & Sugar set from Amazon,"This is a hard set to find, but beautiful. The first set arrived a year ago all broken. This one made it safely. They will be used as Jam & Gravy servers. I am very pleased that they arrived just before Christmas and were a gift."
3,Diminishing Returns,"I have loved The Donnas from day one. Since they ""turned 21,"" I've noticed that they've lost a lot of their edginess. Maybe it's because the first four albums weren't so ""produced."" And let's face it, big business ruins bands after a while if they're not careful. Atlantic Records has a way of overcommercializing and over ""pop""ifying artists. Look at what they did to Jewel!If you're looking for REAL music from The Donnas, get their first four albums.Don't get me wrong, I still love them and will continue to support them. I just hope they realize how repetitive and bubble gum they are starting to sound and go back to the garage to record some real music."
2,Not up to Par,"I agree with the other guy who wrote this review, I'll quote him on it,""Well, I guess it's a decent pop album, but where's the aggressive sneer, the hungry attitude and emotion of previous albums? C'mon gals, just because you've gotten popular doesn't mean you have to sell out and get complacent. This may be a decent pop album for some other artist, but I've thoroughly enjoyed Donnas albums of years past and this PALES in comparison. Very vanilla, very much by the numbers""I think he hits the nail on the head. The more I listen to it, I'm sure it will grow on me some. But when I throwed in ""Turn 21"" and ""Spend the Night"" for the first time, I was BLOWN AWAY, and couldn't stop listening. I'm getting the very opposite feeling from this album."
3,Cool CD,"First off, I only gave the CD three stars because I've only owned it for about three hours and haven't listened to the whole thing yet. So far I'm really impressed. I've been a DONNAS fan for a few years now and to me the new album is just a natural progression for them. They usually sound like the RAMONES, but this time around it's with a touch of BLONDIE or the GO-GOs (both are undeniably cool bands). The guitars on the album kick ass but I'd say the most notable improvement is the vocals. The singer already had one of the best female voices in rock (check out the their cover of Strutter on the Detroit Rock City soundtrack) but this time she went from snobby to just plain seductive. It's a hell of a nice touch. Oh, if you don't know, the Donnas kick ass in concert. I saw them open for Alice Cooper a few years ago and they blew the roof off the Universal Amphitheater. Check them out if you get a chance."
2,What's the big deal?,"Another wanna be punk group. One thing for sure, they took AC/DC's sound. I'm not a huge fan of AC/DC, but it's wrong to take some other band's hard earned sound, just because you can't come up with one yourself. Be inspired by a group, not rip off the group.Second of all, all their songs sound EXACTLY the same. I'm not kidding. The lyrics are kinda stupid and the songs can get repetetive. I gave this CD two stars because I liked the songs Friends like mine and Fall Behind Me.Unfortuantely, my friend has become brainwashed to this crap.If you are a fan, please don't be offended. It's my opinion, so deal with it.This group just isn't that good.Like I said before, if you like this group, like it. But if you want something a bit better, try Nirvana."
1,nothing here!,"Pretending that this is actually quality Rock-n Roll,is like pretending that the girls are as atractive as thealbum cover would lead you to beleive. I don't think so!"
5,This album rocks!,"The person who wrote the amazon review for this album must have been a complete idiot. This album is great. I love every single song on it. It is a great CD to turn up really loud and sing to at the top of your lungs while driving with all your windows down. I have always liked the Donnas and yes, this album does sound different, more produced and less punk/garage/party - esque, but it retains the spirit of what the Donnas are all about through and through. I think it is a move in the right direction for them and I look forward to their new album coming out this year."
3,Good CD for fans of The Donnas,"Gold Medal is a good CD that fans of The Donnas, and fans of classic rock, should enjoy. It not as punk-pop as Spend The Night, and lens more toward a 70s vibe. Classic Pop Rock. Reminds me of Foo Fighters meets Heart. I like every track on the CD, and while there are no sonic surprises, it's solid song after song."
1,What the heck happened to the Donnas???,"I'm going to, perhaps unfairly, guess that the problem with this album lies with the producer. Somebody convinced the band to change their style from 'tough-chick AC/DC' to 'lame-rock with distorted guitars'. What was fun about the Donna's was their aggressiveness and attitude, both of which seem to be sorely lacking on this one. On the previous albums you didn't mind that the singer really can't sing, but the songs on this one really make it somewhat painfully obvious. Not their best, but good luck to 'em anyway."
3,The fun is almost over,"Here is what I love about the Donnas : Fast Songs, 1-2-3 Ramones like anthems, lyrics that make me smile, tight guitar sound, all their releases up to 'Spend the Night'.Here is what you get on Gold Medal : Mid-Tempo Songs and thin 70's guitar sound.I think, 'Spend the Night' was their peak. The production was tight, the songs were great and fast, and the lead guitar was somewhere close to Ace Frehley. Unfortunately, on the new album, they abandoned their punk/ramones roots and deliver more of a 'Glam Rock' approach album. But the production is thin and the songs are just not as good as they used to be. This album is a disappointment to me, and I hope, they will return to their bubblegum-punk before the party is over. I suggest, buy all their previous CDs before spending your money on 'Gold Medal'."
3,"Love The Donnas, Don't Love This CD","I like the Donnas, I really do. For one thing you have to see them live, they're an exciting and fun act to catch. For another thing The Donnas are very cool. My friends and I saw them at an outdoor show on the Erie Canal last summer and we ended up at the same bar as three of the Donnas afterward. Brett, Torry and Allison partied with us and were unbelievably down-to-earth and fun to hang out with.This CD isn't their best though, I have to admit. For some reason the ""punch"" is missing that their earlier records have. Maybe it's the cowbell missing in action, I don't know. Some of the lyrics are hilarious though as usual: ""I may not be a man but you're not one either.""If you're new to the Donnas you should get The Donnas Turn 21 or Spend the Night first. But, catch the Donnas live if you can, they rock!"
4,"""the donnas"" grow up","it appears as though some people were hoping for a sequel to spend the night with the new album. gold medal certainly isnt that; this album explores an evolved sound and lyrical competence that goes beyond the albeit catchy and rockin retro sex vamp theme of previous releases. the donnas are growing up, and their sound is following.""i dont want to know"" is a smart opener - it easily sucks in both new and old fans alike. but songs like ""don't break me down"" and the brief but brave ""the gold medal"" are gems that showcase the donnas sonic growth.this album is more sophisticated and less obvious than previous releases, and it will still rock you solid. whats not to like?"
5,Great rock album!,"I have listened to this album over and over again. I think it's their best all-around work, plain and simple. Nothing else to say."
3,3rd place Medal,"Of the three Donnas' records that I currently own (Gold Medal, Bitchin', and Spend the Night), Gold Medal comes in third place. This album overall is more of a mellow approach than the other two. It does hold up, but it is just okay, with flashes of brilliance like ""you got nothin' on me""By far ""Bitchin'"" is the best Donnas album, and if you could only buy one, I'd get that one."
2,No so hot,"I have to agree with the others who said this album sounds like the record company talked them into softening their sound to be more commerical. The guitar parts and more subdued, although perhaps more techincally proficient, and the vocals have lost their edge. And the lyrical content is ""safer"" and more parent-friendly. What's up with that? Someone mentioned Avril Lavigne, which I thought was funny because there was one track on their that reminded me of her as well. I like Avril, but I didn't want to her the Donnas doing Avril.This album doesn't compare at all with the power, edgy-ness or attitude of ""get Skintight"". I'd rather listen to any of their previous albums, and I think I have them all. O.K., so maybe it's better than the Electrocutes album, but lord it's not good."
2,eh,"sorry ladies. i liked some of your previous work but this release will not do. it seems over-produced. spending too much time on your hair and trying to look pretty than on your music.i liked you before because you reminded me of the runaways.but now you are just another pop rock band.it's bad enough that liz went this route but now you too? oh well.theres really nothing to savor here, no memorable tunes.and that video,good god.anyway...a big disappointment as i was expecting more rocking tunes."
2,Not too much imagination at work here!,"Being an MP3 and playlist-obsessive person, I gave this book a perusal at the bookstore. There wasn't a whole lot of thought put into many of these lists. Just because a batch of songs has the word ""martini"" in the title, for example, doesn't make them hold together as a playlist. When you're thinking about making a playlist for the open road, the songs you pick don't need to necessarily describe the road, but should make you feel alive and free. One of the downsides to itunes is that anyone can drag and drop songs and think they've made a worthy playlist. Real playlist making takes eons of internal debate (like John Cusack's character in ""High Fidelity""). There is an art to making mixes that this book generally misses out on."
5,Price too high...way too high,"I love these mugs. They are gorgeous, a perfect size, and very substantial. However, I bought mine on the Pfaltzgraff home site for less than 1/3 this price. Same with the plates and bowls."
4,Radio flyer...,"I'd give it 3.5 stars if possible. Why? Martin's music is more like a religion than an interest, so everthing should be 5 stars, right? Well, these aren't his songs, but they are really good. The two best are on the UK import of Loverman (Loverman and the German ditty), alas, they're probably not the album versions. Five stars would be all the songs being as good as these. Four stars would be different production. People seem to really like blips and squeaks atop sub-sonics, but I think this is just the Depeche Mode version of being on the bandwagon (instead of building the wagon like they did in the beginning)."
5,"...Stoner stuff, nice!","OK, I'm gonna be honest so that people don't get confused since we have all these Depeche fanatics reviewing this album.The album sound NOTHING like Depeche Mode and is not supposed to. It is basically Martin Gore's visions through other artists' tunes that he enjoys.It is NOT supposed to be listened to in a car, or in any noisy environment whatsoever. It is simply an album to turn off the lights and get really stoned. And you know what? It really works...it is just as druggy as Pink Floyd, for example. So buy it for that reason. Very nice job by Martin."
4,Great Songs Get Great Treatment,"While Martin Gore's first solo release was very short and rather demo-like in sound quality, ""Counterfeit2"" is a full fledged album. I haven't heard of either of the two producers listed on the album but, they do a great job. The mood is very much like Depeche Mode's last album, Exciter. After the last ten years of Martin favoring his guitar over his synths, the lack of guitars is quite a surprise. Though Martin didn't write these songs he has chosen songs that flow together very well. This isn't your typical remake album; a fan can sit and listen to this cd and hear how these songs influenced Martin Gore and, for that reason I love them, too."
4,counterfeit2,"Depeche Mode being my favourite band, of course i was looking forward to this release. the ballads on the depeche albums sung by martin gore were always a highlight for me. I love his voice but i think that his strengths lie in his lyrics. Of course on this solo cd these are covers, so i think that takes away a little for me. Also - and i hate to agree with this- i do think what the amazon.com reviewer said is true about this collection--martin does not sing a lot of these songs with great emotion.or at least the emotion we're used to getting from him.Could it be because he didn't compose them?- i don't know. this is a great collection of songs, my faves are ""stardust"", ""loverman"" and ""in my time of dying"". i think Gore did an awesome job of making them his own.overall this is a great cd, definately worth buying just for his uniquely beautiful voice, but no, i'm sorry' its not as good as his first solo album."
1,It Stinks,"I'm a huge Depeche Mode fan, and I even have Martin's earlier solo attempt. However, I must admit that this CD stinks. It sounds like something that was put together overnight, without any thought or effort. This is certainly not what I was expecting from Martin Gore. What a waste of $$$!"
4,martin gore: alien throb god or papersack?,"i've read every review i could find of counterfeit 2 and one thing remains consistent: music critics are almost completely inept when it comes to writing anything that resembles insight or authority when it comes to martin gore. their words swim in thoughtless pools of mediocrity; which is apparently where they believe counterfeit 2 should reside. all that aside, anyone who is a fan of depeche mode, and particularly fond of martin, will appreciate this album beyond words. even those who may find depeche mode to be unfamiliar have the potential to hear the brilliance in this album. it's warm and beautiful. Martin's strong, etherial voice and ability to create rhythmic atmospheres that pop like over-sized bubble-wrap is astounding. personal highlights include 'by this river', 'lost in the stars' and 'candy says'."
5,What a great album,"This is definitely better album than his first counterfeit album. Every song on this album is good. The best songs on this album are: In my time of dying, stardust, I cast a lonesome shadow, loverman, and oh my love. Martin does a great job in all these remakes. This great song writer does a great tribute to all the artist that wrote these songs."
1,"""Its no good""","I had to at least give it one star because after all its Martin Gore and he deserves something.However I was really let down by what I heard .The songs lacked emotion and were pretty much monotone.They sounded like a train wreck .Worse yet he had that same tone deaf sound of someone who had one too many at the local Karaoke lounge.Im sorry Martin we all know you are capable of so much more than this.If this is what your career would be without Depeche Mode please stay the course with D.M.After ""Counterfeit-I"" it should have ended.We all know that sequels usually bomb and this was no exception.To quote one of D.M.s songs ""Its no good"".Now I think I will ""Enjoy the Silence"".This was not ""Music for the masses.""Okay I'll stop now."
5,A beautiful voice for beautiful songs,"Chayanne sings beautifully on this CD - some slow, romantic songs, and some faster fun songs. The nice thing is that the CD label has the words printed in Spanish so you can sing along or just learn the words."
2,Alpha-rip off,"This doesn't even have all the letters in the alphabet!!!!!! The images stinks, i regret buying this. I only give it a 2 because at least it had some of the letters. I would not recommend these to anyone."
3,Mas o menos,"El lector funciona a veces, otras no... Desde el inicio fué así, lo he probado en varias máquinas con diferentes windows... Mejor comprarse otro lector"
4,A real page turner !!!!!,"Prey, Messiah is a spiritual expedition that Incorporates the age old struggle good vs. evil. A sinister and mysterious work Rhodes Will certainly keep your interest and keep you on the edge of your seat. Full of intrigue, skillful plot development, danger, and imagination Prey, Messiah is well crafted, well thought out and extremely compelling. It challenges beliefs about religion, spirituality, mysticism, the supernatural, and the bible. This book speaks well for the enormous amount of talent of young Black American Authors.Leslie Blanchard"
1,A Little Knowledge is a Dangerous Thing,"Maybe it was a different time. If he published the book in 1977, and he was getting older at that time, then Corey reflects the sadly outdated attitudes of his day toward cats.The book only marginally deals with the title, ""Do Cats Think?"", but when he does address the title, he does so admirably. In addition, he does well when puncturing the myth of infallibility and objectivity in the sciences. Yet, the book is mostly stories of his relationships with his many cats. Had he limited himself to his stories, the book would have been a treasure.However, the heartwarming stories mostly end with the violent deaths of the cats. This book is, albeit unintentionally, a prime argument against free-ranging companion animals, even in so-called ""safe"" rural areas. Corey never seems to connect cause and effect.I'd recommend this book only if you know a lot about the subject, and can separate the wheat from the chaff."
2,Goes great with my power crystals,A few whale sounds away from the New Age section of your local record store.
2,Waste of money!,Don't buy this book...such a waste of money!! All these cookies can be found in a standard cookbook...
4,Works Good,I have been buying this product already from my dermatologist. It was much cheaper online from Amazon. It doesn't dry out your face after you wash it off.
5,Spectacular journey i just wish it was longer,"The person who i borrowed this book from said they didn't like it much. I was expecting a boring book about hiking, but was surprised with an incredible journey. I only wish the book was longer!One reason i think this book is good is the length of the hike. While the author had to cover a decent amount of mileage a day he did not need to speed as much as PCT hikers do. This allows the author to linger a bit, interact with people and things, and really relay his thoughts onto paper.The book really does cover as many topics as the different landscapes across Oregon. I've been blessed to travel around a lot of Oregon and know how much the animals, people, and plants change from one part of the state to another. Bill does a good job of changing topics from one section of the hike to the next. You really feel as if your hiking with him.I only hope to take a journey like this sometime soon in my life."
5,A real adventure,"I've read and reread this book several times. For any adventurer or would-be adventurer, this book is the one to read. William Sulivan's other books and trail guides are easily the best available on Oregon hiking. Read the books, and if you get the chance, visit Mr. Sullivan at one of his book signings. Love that Cardiac-Arrest French Toast!"
5,The simplicity of the book and weight loss tips are profound,"i was very impressed with vicki and her very straightforward directions for losing weight. everybody tries to claim inside information or a secret solution, but vicki can really help people that desperately need help. i hope everybody finds her book that is searching for an answer to weight loss. i started her plan and followed her recipes the same day i read her book. thank you vicki-i will write back in a year when i have lost 135 pounds. i am confidant that i can thanks to you. sandra fansler"
5,Cookbook,Love this cookbook....lots of great recipes and hints for a low fat diet!! If you're looking for ways to cut fat out of your diet but still enjoy good food this is a great book!!
5,Live Don't Diet,"I think the word ""Diet"" scares most overweight people. Living is a lifestyle and isn't a structured meal plan -- knowing what can be done to adjust healthy alternatives to certain recipes is soooo much more fun."
3,Good Smell but the 'cap' clogs after about 2 uses,I bought two different scents of this product and like the scent of both.Very subtle scent.Only problem is that both cans 'clogged up' and would not spray after 2 or three uses.If you take off the cap and run under warm water it works again.Frustrating though to have to do this just to use a product.
1,"Pretentious, precious and verbose","I couldn't help but feel that Mr. Booth wanted to say something worthwhile in this book -- somehow he just couldn't ""spit it out."" In the opening chapter the claim is made that one can learn the trade secrets of artists to use in one's everyday life. If this is possible, the means to achieving it were definitely lost on me. The book is overly wordy; the author has a penchant for using the etymology of certain words in an attempt to illuminate deep truths, however the results are confusing and pretentious. I also found the authors frequent claim that we are all just like the great masters patronizing."
3,Its ok,I was really expecting more from some of these vetsWhen is Medusa going to drop a solo album???!!!
3,not what i got,"i order a gift set and i got a bag, i don't know it it was the bag that the gift set was suppose to be in , but that was not what i was expecting , i called up the seller and they were nice enough to give me a full refund, and for that i was pleased, i would buy from them again seen that they tried to make up for their mistake,"
4,Surprisingly Good,"I thought at first that an actrees trying to sing would be horrible, but I surprisingly liked the ""So Yesterday"" song. I've had it stuck in my head all day. I'm going to go purchase the full cd in a little while. Just don't tell anyone I like Hilary Duff music/Lizzie McGuire...I'm 18 years old! (Shhh!!!!)"
1,NOOO!,How many music fans are there? okay I'll get back on topic.. Hilary duff sounds like a toad! I can sing even sing better than her.. but then agaiin... EVERYONE CAN! this deserves 0
3,"About as ""yesterday"" as anything recent","In my opinion, this whole hype about Hilary Duff is about as ""so yesterday"" as any other actress who is made to look like something she's not. Her voice isn't anything special. It sounds monotone and emotionless and mainly the reason she into music is because she's such a teen thing with her show she's being pushed to ""sing"". The songs sound like anything else generated from the Matrix ""Hit machine"". The Matrix is beginning to become the new ""Max Martin"" hit machine, fake, bland and nonsense. It's being used up on people who really don't need it. If this girl has any talent she would stop acting like she's such a bubbly little blondie who's singing stuff for hype. I'd like to see her sing live, then I might change my opinion. I bet she would lip-sync and do what she does best, ""act"" like a singer."
3,So Yesterday is a great song,"""So Yesterday"" is a great jam. Rumor has it that it was inspired by her real life experience. I'm not gonna call out names though. I like this song, and looking forward to the album. I didn't like the B side however, it is too strange for my tastes - that lessens the CD by 2 stars so I give it a 3."
5,Two Awesome Songs!,"Hey, this cd is great. The two songs on here, so yesterday and working it out are good to dance to and have fun with. Now, I admit, Hilary Duff's voice isn't the best out there, she's not Christina Aguilera (best singer in the world) but Hilary's songs are awesome! I definitelly recommend this to you!"
1,Hilary Fluff,"Hilary Duff is fulla fluff. I cant stand this disney channel pop! What I find funny though is that her song gets on the radio and tv right away, and her boyfriends aaron carters music is never on the radio! Lol, this still stinks though. ""So Yesterday"" lol, Im sorry Hilary, but that was ""so Yesterday!"
3,one song? haha!,"ok.. one of you said there was only one song on this cd, and that it was so boring just listening to one song.. haha.. first of all, there's two songs on this cd, and second off all this is a SINGLE, single=one. see? there isn't supposed to be a lots of songs on this cd, but one, or maybe two.. see?now, my review:-So Yesterday: Hilary has an ok voice here, and it's an ok song.. it can get really boring after a while, but the lyric is reasoneble. =) By the way, there where someone on the metamorphosis review board, that said the line: ""if the light is of, then it isn't on"" was so not meaningful.. well, it's actually really meaningful! if the light is off, then it isn't on, not availeble, thats how it is, don't want you, etc.. get it?- workin' it out- good lyric, suetes her voice better, and a good beat.. =)"
1,CANT SING,hilary duff or should i saw hilary puff ball is fat ugly and cant sing to save her life with out help from her computer. and a hilary hater u took the words right out of my mouth thank u so much
1,Does anyone still have taste???,"GOD!!! People!!! What the heck is wrong with you all? It seems the media, including all the ""normal people,"" just want someone new to praise, and idolize; do we still have any taste anymore? C'mon, I can count all the really talented people on one hand! Really! Everyone is trying to be triple or double threats nowadays!!! There are so many people out there that are so much more talented than she is! Her songs are good; but it's the voice people should admire, not the looks; people like me just get dismissed with one look because we're not ""pop star material."" I know a lot of people that are way more talented than she is! Tell me now, has she ever won something like a school award for being smart? Oh, wait...she probably hasn't heard of such a thing."
1,"Fake, Fake, Fake!","Ha! Hillary Duff is nothing but a little girl, trying to sing! She cannot sing at all! I can name one million people who can sing better than her... she sounds like a little kid! She's a wannabe pop star, and unfortunately, all those people out there are responding to her cheesy songs. I have to admit, they do have a nice beat to them, but that's pretty much it. Everything else SUCKS! If it were up to me, she would get 0 stars."
1,"Hillary will be ""So Yesterday""","After hearing this song I hoped that the idea of Hillary Duff having a singing career was a joke. Besides being a terrible actor she is a terrible singer! Seriously, the only reason she has a record deal is because she was on a T.V show. As a an aspiring singer I'm discusted at how bad she sings. I think after this one song Hillary will be ""So Yesterday""."
4,"Increased gas mileage, no noticeable power increase.",My mpg went up a 2 mpg's in my Saab 9-3 aero after installing this. Power wise I didn't feel any difference.
5,Fit is perfect and adds a little noise to the turbo,"The fitment is perfect, and increased the sound of the turbo on my 2010 9-3 aero (2.0 turbo). I chose this because the local auto part stores never have the oem paper filter in stock. With this I just clean every oil change and reinstall."
3,Its ok,"didnt really notice anything, maybe a little louder? maybe? gas mileage? about the same maybe give or take one or two mpg's maybe? couldve been other things. all in all not bad but nothing great"
2,Calculator for FE exam,IMPORTANTyou are better off buying the S version of this calculator because it contains solar power and a battery. This only contains a battery. i think the S type will be more dependable expecially if you are buying this product for a standard test like the FE or PE; it's also cheaper. Hope this helps.
1,Calculator dies after a short while,"Bought this in late '04. Practically unused and sitting in its protective cover. I go to use it this semester and... nothing, it won't turn on. Open case and battery is good. Call TI, they tell me it is out of warranty and to have it serviced I will have to pay $7, +$4 shipping, +$5 return shipping. More than calculator is worth. I had an old TI-30 that lasted more than 5 years of heavy use. What happened to TI quality? I can't recommend this piece."
2,I don't think it is a real Makita,"This battery looks kind of a like a Makita, but does not bear the name.It seems to fail to hold a charge well. Buy a real Makita battery, this isn't it."
1,"save your $, get one at the auto store or motorcycle dealer","this is useless; the reamer, glue and bag are ok, but the insertion tool and plugs are useless, it was nearly impossible to insert a plug with this tool even after modifying it on the grinder. get another brand!"
5,Richard Sharp finale,"This book is the 21st in the entire series regarding the military and personal life of Richard Sharp. The book ends the series and many hours of reading pleasure authored by Barnard Cornwell and the adventures, trials and tribulations of Richard Sharp. It was a bittersweet ending to a series of books that I read ""straight through""....21 different novels in a row. All enjoyable and historically informative. This last one was as good as any other...easily read, enough action and intrigue to keep your interest and just enough history to broaden your mind and perspective. I have now gotten the Saxon Series to read but taking a quick detour into Stonehenge...which is also very good.Cornwell is one of my favorite authors."
2,The worst sharpe book,"While this may be the worst of the Sharpe series, it is still an entertaining read. You certainly shouldn't go into it expecting much. The original Sharpe's didn't have a huge amount of depth, but this one is particularly shallow. The enemies are unconvincing, the battles are fairly short and glossed over. Sharpe meeting the Emperor is a hugely entertaining premise that just doesn't pan out. All Sharpe fans should read it, just expect a light entertaining read."
2,Weakest of the series,"I've read nearly all the full-length Sharpe books, and this is definitely the weakest. The plot is desultory and predictable, the characters thinly drawn, and worst of all, Harper is reduced to comic relief. I still read it - it's still Sharpe - but it's a disappointment. If you haven't read the other books in the series, I urge you to put this off until you can't stand waiting for Cornwell to come out with his next book. Chronologically, that should be easy, since this book takes place after Sharpe's been retired for a good long time."
2,Highly Dubious Authorship,"This is easily the worst of the Sharpe novels. I've read every one of Bernard Cornwell's books, most of them several times, and I frankly don't believe that he was the main author of this one. The plot is lame, the action unconvincing, and most of all the prose is stilted and inappropriate, lacking almost all of the drive and energy of ALL the other books. It just doesn't read like Cornwell at all; the action is nothing like what we are used to, the characters lack conviction, and Sharpe and Harper simply don't act, sound or respond like the two men we know.My guess is that an editor was responsible for most of the work. You can write an addition to a series, use all the same characters, but that's not enough. Examples are to be seen in LeBeau's splendid Buckskin novels and those after the first 12 - check these out, you won't be sorry - Ruth Plumly Thompson's Oz works; and at least one of the Travis McGee books, which just doesn't ring true. Anyone feel the same way?"
1,Dreadful,"I found this book to be hypocritical and vacuous. Students will get little out of it that they don't already know. The author talks down to students and ""dumbs down"" the topics covered.The Littlejohn textbook is much better."
