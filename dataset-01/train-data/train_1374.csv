5,HOT HOT HOT,"Ari Brown is a Chicago fixture. Pharoah is just great, very exciting music ! All ledgents ! Just saw Ari live last nite ! needs more followers"
3,An action movie for a rainy day,"This movie isn't an A-list oscar winner, but it's worth a look for anyone whos got time on their hands and like action movies. The acting and story line could have used some work, but it's better than some things I've seen. Again, this is only for those who like mindless action and time to kill."
1,Not another one,"Yes, unfortunatly, another Delta Force film. Just like the rest, they all die 'saving' America. In one word, terrible."
5,As much fun for adults as for kids,"It is refreshing to see a children's book that is as fun for adults as it is for kids. This book is like the movie Shrek; many of the things appeal to adults, even though it is primarily designed for kids."
3,Ooooooh nooooo!,"I got one of these for $10 at the Smithsonian Museum of American History at Washington, D.C. At the time I didn't know who Mr. Bill was. The cashier told me that he was famous before I was even born! So after some research I discovered how Mr. Bill got onto SNL. This is a unique toy that you can't find at a lot of places (or maybe I wasn't looking hard enough...) Even my mom loves Mr. Bill (the toy.) Warning: Don't play with Mr. Bill if your hands are all sweaty because the colors will rub off and might smear onto Mr. Bill's pure white play-doh skin.* It's happened to me already and people think that I purposely made Mr. Bill look like he has a bindi on his forehead. As long as you don't have sweaty hands, Mr. Bill will keep you entertained for hours. (wink wink)*This toy is not made of play-doh, like the Mr. Bill that shows up on SNL."
5,very easy to understand,This book is so easy to understand. It is so easy to understand i learned some of the advanced techniques like how to make forms before i learned the basics.
3,Just another Dummy!,"As a novice or someone thinking about working with HTML, I think this book was over my head. If one had some background in HTML they could probably make full/better use of its content.Cynthia Briggs, Cookbook AuthorPork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and ReflectionsSweet Apple Temptations"
1,Absolutely a Waste of Time,"After struggling with this book through the first several chapters I finally decided to logon and look for other books on the subject. I ordered one of them and I sincerely hope it won't also be a waste of time.Just to double check my impressions of this book I checked the other reviews on this site and found one (other than mine) one-star rating and 3 (3!) five star ratings. How can this be? Am I and the guy that also thought this book was useless completely out of it? To repeat the sentiment expressed by the author of that review, Naaaah! This book is a waste of your money AND a waste of your time. It actually has negative value. By the time you've read it you will have many misconception to overcome that you didn't have before."
2,This is the worst I have ever read on HTML,"I learned HTML with out any book. All I did was look at the document source of some of the pages I went to and found out how to write the HTML. But I wanted to learn more so I got this book. If I did't know how to write HTML before I got this book I would not know how to write it. I have another book that is really good it is ""Web Publishing with HTML 4 in a week. You don't need a big expensive book to learn something as basic as HTML. It is the easiest language out there. You could just teach yourself!"
2,"For SMARTIES, not dummies","Unlike other fine Dummies books, this Dummies book tosses you right into cold HTML waters, and keeps taking you deeper, while you look for shore. I got in over my head fast, and I had some HTML experience via the web. I eventually learned HTML mostly through FREE web tutorials; they are often concise, one small chunk at a time, and you make pages as you go. Plus they're conversational and often funnier than this disappointment.I refer to this book only occasionally. Any humor seemed to be tacked onto headings as an afterthought; Mostly it was a rather dry technical text book. And there are too few examples (""Here's the code, and here's how it looks in your browser"" isn't seen often).I now have a complex web site I'm proud of -- but I learned how elsewhere."
1,A POORLY written dummies book,The book was awful. The book always goes of subject by showing you the design of a webpage instead of the actual HTML. Get another book on HTML if you want to learn HTML. If you want to make a good looking webpage then get it because thats all this book is about for the most part.
4,"An excellent book, for dummies ;)","As the title says, this book is for people with very little knowledge of HTML - but knowledge of how to use a computer at an intermediate level. It covers most basic HTML tags, up to and including tables and a limited amount of framesets, as well as providing a large reference section aimed at the beginning HTML coder, becoming a decent reference manual even after the Tutorial section is finished.It's not the be-all and end-all of coding references, but it's perfect for someone that is comfortable with a computer, and wants to being creating simple web pages. This can take an individual with little knowledge and give them enough information to where they can understand the more complex online references and puzzle out the rest, or to a level where they can successfully invest their time in learning more about CSS, JavaScript, and DHTML to move to more complex sites."
2,Don't buy this book...,"I am currently taking an introductory class called ""Build your Own Website."" This book is required reading. When I went to my local bookstore to get ""Html4 for Dummies with CD ROM,"" the sales associate did everything in her power to dissuade me from buying it. Now, 2 weeks into the course (and the book) I understand why.There is too much text in this book: long, verbose explanations that make learning a chore. It is no fun to read, and is often confusing. Unless you are in the same situation as I (your professor demands that you use this, and only this, text) don't waste your money. Elizabeth Castro has written a much better book on this subject."
3,HTML for Dummies,I was happy when I received the book. It was in good condition. I had it for a couple of weeks and finally broke the seal on the CD envelope in the back of the book. The CD was cracked and will not play.
1,Redundant,I've bought a few dummies books through the years and the one common theme throughout them all is REDUNDANCY. They repeat the same things over and over ad nauseaum. Do your self a favor and pickup the basics (all you'll get from this book)at any number of online sites. Do a google search of Basic HTML and you'll get a lot of sites and will teach you more than this book and it's FREE! Please avoid this junk. Besides who do they think they're calling dummies? You're only a dummy if you buy there products. Just call me a reformed dummy.
3,"A dull read, better books are available on the subject.","This was okay, but I think the CD on the back was the bes thing about it...having included a trial of Homesite 4. I found it boring to read (not that learning code is exciting, but still...), and couldn't finish. The code charts are helpful, but there are many other HTML books that are more enjoyable and better priced-HTML 4 Visual Quickstart Guide, for example."
1,"For dummies, in a way.",I simply expected this book to educate me about how to use HTML code. There is too much unwanted subjective advice on what makes good content for a web page. The technical explanation of HTML code is confused and poorly organized. The authors' shameless self-promotion -- using their own company's website to serve in the examples throughout the book -- undermines their integrity as writers of educational material.
1,terrible,"this book is only for people who know some about HTML, if your a beginner, or you only know a little, this book won't help you a lick."
3,HTML 4 For Dummies,"Dummies books are quite valuable in their variety of topic choice, and knowledge base. This book is good, and an easy read when used as a reference base. HTML is not for everyone, but is certainly of interest to those of us who venture into constructing web pages."
2,High expectations crushed,"I love dummies books so I had high expectations up until chaper 6. I actually started to feel ill trying to grasp all of the tag information contained in this 1000(actually 100)page chapter. The problem was that there were no examples in this relatively huge chapter to help clarify all of the information.Granted, examples for each tag were supplied on the CD which came with the book but there are 100s of sites out there which will gladly teach HTML for free!I wanted a good book because I didnt want to HAVE to be glued to my computer to memorize tags. This book could have been awsome if it didnt rely so heavily on the CD.The CD should compliment the info in the book- not suppliment it.An additional 50-100 pages of backup examples could have saved this book in my humble opinion."
1,and I always thought dummies books were for complete beginners...,Caveat emptor to the absolute beginner. This book is not written for the beginning web page creator. It is not written in a tutorial style. It is good as a reference source as you study a true tutorial type book. It discusses tags and their attributes one at a time without showing you how they fit into your web page code. The beginning chapters throw lots of advanced features at you and tell you they will be discussed in chapter 19 etc.I was completely overwhelmed after 20 min of reading. So what's a beginner to do? I recommend Create Your First Web Page in a Weekend. By the time you get half way through that book then you can use this dummies book as a reference.william
2,Castro's Book is much better!,"A big disappointment. Elizabeth Castro's book runs circles around this work. It is badly organized and badly written. Of course one can learn from it, but one can learn Chinese from Cantonese restaurant menus too. Big deal... Get Castro's book instead!"
1,Does not get to the point,"Instead of just explaining the tags and showing examples the book goes into long-winded discussions on how things work -- discussions that amount to nothing more than filler, which the reader must sort through in order to find the information he needs. It is a very basic book. I just purchased it and could not wait to learn HTML. After reading the first chapters I actually became disgusted. It does not get to the point or even teach you the way a book should instruct you."
1,Waste of time,"This book is a waste of time because they spend too much time trying to be funny, and to little time with content. I read about 50 pages and learned nothing about HTML tags, so I got frustrated and quit reading. I couldn't even tell you anything I learned from that damn book. I could, however, remember about 1 million horrible jokes and idiotic references to unrelated matters. I like the Dummies series - I have learned from other books - but the writers in this one are lame."
1,Beware of spam below!,"Notice 1)how all three reviews below were posted on practically the same day and there hasn't been another review since. 2)how all three reviews say pretty much the same thing...nothing! And 3)how all three reviewers gave it 5 stars. The ""helpful"" ratings were even spammed. Or maybe I'm wrong....naaaah"
3,poor installation instructions & Tech help,"This item works good, but the problem is they don't tell you you have to have or purchase expensive cable ends in order to make it work. These things should of been included or explained. It took several calls for help to tech support and they only had one tech 2 of whom they wouldn't let you talk too. You better know what 6 pin Din, BNC and RCA plug ends mean and how to change a BNC to a RCA plug with an adapter from Radio Shack. After all the info and frustration I went through I sat down and figured the proper way to hook it up. I almost sent it back."
4,music to get naked to,Light a candle.Get out the lube and condoms.Get naked with your partner and play Lizzys version of Fire.OOOOOOOH la la !
3,After-hours engagement,"3 1/2Karate sound like a slightly more progressive Athlete or a mellower Pavement. They play more informed jazzy-rock then your typical indie guitar getup, occasional licks sometimes even reminding me a of Trey Anastasio of Phish. Ultimately the end result is one of intrigued ambivalence, due to the songs neither sinking in mediocrity nor rising much in triumph."
3,"Love the length, nice construction, still slippery","I love the extra length of this mat, and it is a sturdy well made mat. I've washed it a number of times and have been using it regularly for the past 2 months but still have some serious slippage issues when my hands or feet get a little sweaty. The parts of my body that are not sweaty stick to the mat just fine (almost to a fault - so when I'm moving into my upward facing dog from chaturanga the mat sticks to the tops of my feet and slides up with me as I try to push my chest through, or in dragging my foot through for pigeon, I end up with a bunched up mat underneath me.) I think it would be my first choice mat if I didn't have issues with sweaty slippage and sticking too much when not needed. Just don't expect to take it right out of the box and be perfect for use. I'm sure as this mat gets older it will actually get better."
1,"Dangerously slippery, even after washing","I have an old Tapas Mat by Hugger Mugger that was perfect right out of the box. I've used it so much that it has clear brown spots at the hands and feet that go all the way through. Gross, I know. So I thought it's time to get a new mat. Why not go with what I know works. Unfortunately, something has changed. The mat is dangerously slippery. I've washed it several times in several different ways (soap and water, washing machine, vinegar), but I can't get rid of the oily slickness. It's useless. If anyone has any advice, please let me know."
2,Too slippy,I have found this mat to be very slippy which makes holding postions difficult. I'm hoping with use that it will wear in but after six uses there's not much improvement.
4,New Yogi's First Yoga Mat,"I'm no expert, but I think this is a quality mat and a great value for the price. I washed mine as suggested and I only experienced a *little* slippage the first time I used it, and I don't think I even washed it thoroughly enough (small bathtub, big mat!) That said, I think with time/more cleanings it will be just fine. I also think these are the mats my university gym provides its members to use in yoga classes if they don't bring their own, and I trust their judgment. I ordered the purple mat, for the record:) Color looks like what's shown."
2,"Good mat, slightly too thin","This is a great mat, but at my gym (where I take yoga) the mat does not provide enough support for the floor exercises; especially when balancing on knees...and I get bruises on my knees weekly. I would purchase a slightly thicker mat in the future, but I LOVE the longer length!!"
1,"BUYER Beware...Warning Will Robinson, Warning !","After reading the review that exposed the fact that this product contains rice maltodextrin, (if you don't know what that is and the effects that it has on diabetics...Google it).I feel really ripped off! I am SURE that that is why this product is always on SALE! They are trying to dump it!!I only discovered this minor detail after I was getting ready to reorder. It would seem to me that a company like Swanson would have enough sense to know what maltodextrin is, and that they would not sell a product like this to those wishing to control their sugar; (0r at least a WARNING in big RED letters). Of course if that did that, they probably would not sell any of this product since 99.5% of the people that purchase this product do so with that fact in mind.WARNING: READ ALL LABELS and RESEARCH EVERY PURCHASE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY! Otherwise, the SHARKS will get YOU!"
5,Great product - fast shipping!,"Great product, and at a great price. Avoid the hype of the Stevia products that add in things like fiber, etc. This stuff is great, and at a super good price!"
4,real life missions,"Dr. Bruce Carlton's Amazing Grace: Lessons on Church Planting Movements from Cambodia is a brutally honest tale of a missionary and his family from their experiences in Cambodia from 1990-1995. The striking thing about the way this story is told is the author's transparency about his own doubts, misgivings and shortcomings. He did not even want to go to Cambodia, thinking instead he was going to serve as a director of humaitarian efforts in Indochina. Providentially, he was suddenly given the position of church planter in Cambodia though he never asked(or desired) the position.What follows is a personal family journey of growing to love the Khmer people with several stories of people along the way with biblical lessons learned.This book will give you a fresh insight on missions and your own personal walk with Christ. I heartitly recommend it.Michael D. Settle"
4,Great,"Ice-T's greatest hits is a must have for any Ice-T fan who does not have the complete Ice-T album catalog. Songs such as: That's How I'm Living, 6 In The Morning, and I'm Your Pusher show why Ice-T is simply on e of the best rappers ever. If you are a true fan of Hip Hop, Ice-T's greatest hits is a must have."
5,THE ICEMAN COMETH.,This is a well put together compilation from probably the best rapper out today.It contains many of his classic hits and is very well put together.I wish there were more rappers of the same calibre of ice t today.He is a very real person unlike many rappers of today who are simply about image and the pursuit of money.GET THIS CD TODAY.
3,old skool west koast,i don't listen to alot of new rap but this is a cd that is timeless to me. eveything he is rapping about on the album is still happening now a days so it has a contemporary feel to it.
3,Restlessly action,"At first, the film shows two colossi (Bodybuilders Brad Harris as Samson and Alan Steel, real name Sergio Ciani) one against the other, as adversaries with endless fights, but later they will join their forces to stop the traitor and perfidious advisor Warkalla (Serge Gainsbourg very ""versatile"" in his real life). Romilda (Mara Berni), helped by Warkalla, has taken the place of her sister Mila (Irena Prosen), the true Queen of Sulom, who is now in the palace dungeon. Warkalla forces the imprisoned Mila, to know the location of the treasure of Sulom. But could Samson, his friends and the rebels faithful to the Queen stop the traitor Warkalla and his mercenaries from their evil purposes?. Yes, but after a gladiatorial event and some other entertaining feats. The nice Janine (Brigitte Corey) plays also an interesting role as the spy of Palace and later on will become Samson's bride. Not bad!!."
1,Not the Biblical Samson story,This video is so far from the Biblical story of Samson. So don't be deceived. The acting was not any good either.
4,THEY DON'T ALL LOOK ALIKE.BUT...,"This movie is all the evidence you need if you're one of those people who believes that all gladiator/muscleman movies look alike.This features the same cast,costumes and sets from the movie Fury of Hercules.The big difference is that instead of playing Hercules here,Brad Harris plays Samson.And instead of portraying a sadistic villian here,Alan Steel plays a muscular good guy who first fights and then teams up with Harris against the bad guys.Everybody else more or less plays the same roles they did in the other film.This is an entertaining movie,but I prefer Fury of Hercules.Largely because it moves at a quicker pace and Harris gets to put his physique on better display performing more feats of strength.After all he didn't have to share screen time with Steel.Downside is that this disc is from Alpha Movies,so the reproduction quality isn't the best.I still like it.Especially as a companion piece to the other film."
5,Samson movie,"Watched this movie with my dad when I was a kid- had it on VHS- looked for it for years on DVD, finally found it!"
1,Obtuse Monograph,"Book is replete with encumbered, clumsy, and useless social science jargon. Author condescends to homeless populace. Book lends nothing new or noteworthy to the curricula of urban anthropology."
1,Ow; didn't work for me. :(,"I tried both ways to fold the cup and insert it correctly; both failed (not to mention hurt). Getting it out was a challenge; I had to use at least 2 fingers to fish it out, and it was sooo uncomfortable. And no matter what, the cup was always *covered* with blood, not *filled* with blood. The directions say that it should lay low in the vagina, which makes no sense at all, considering that is where all the nerve endings are. (I could always feel it inside me. The directions also say not to push it up far in the vagina because that will cause leakage. I mean, what?) I was really hoping this cup would work, as it says it can be worn overnight for 12 hours, and a tampon only 8. But ugh, it just didn't work for me at all. I will never betray tampons again."
5,Would never switch back to tampons,"The Diva Cup is awesome. It no longer is a burden to have my monthly period. I hardly notice to even have the Diva Cup in, and it is superior for so many reasons. It is much more comfortable since you can't feel it, and is less drying than tampons are. It is less messy, more environmentally friendly, you can go pee while you have it in, they contain no bleaching chemicals, it is more cost-effective, it is more comfortable for working out, and it is easier for travel. I don't have to worry about carrying tampons, and I don't have a white stringhanging out when I change in the locker room. I no longer have to carry tampons around in my purse, and I don't even have to buy tampons at the store. I have only tried the Diva Cup, so I don't have a comparison for other brands. After having a menstrual cup, I have no reason to ever go back to using tampons. It took a few months to perfect the technique, but no difficulties beyond that."
4,Go with the sizing they recommend,"I tried the Model 2 first (because that is what was recommended according to the sizing chart). I leak a little with the Model 2, so must wear a pantyliner but I'm childless and just on the up side of the age cutoff, so... I thought I'd try the Model 1 (thinking that maybe the Model 2 wasn't opening completely and so was leaking...). Well, I leak a lot more when using the Model 1. I have read a lot of reviews on this though and pretty much all are very positive.It is messy though and would not change/empty it while in a public restroom. I still have to wear a pantyliner. This is the way to go if you'd like to help the Earth and if you'd like to save money."
2,Not for Women With Narrow Vaginas,"This product is made from extremely firm and springy silicone that unfolded itself every time I tried to insert it. I spent an entire day shoving it towards my vagina, to no avail. The cup opens with such force that my vulva was left feeling very sore after I tried to insert it. I am about 5'5"" tall and have not had intercourse or delivered and I am under 30 years of age. I have heard that others have had greater success with brands such as Lunette, Ladycup, and Moon Cup. I am now ordering those and hoping they will work, but overall, I am disappointed in the Diva Cup as the many positive reviews of it gave me high expectations. I guess this cup is just not for women with smaller than average vaginas."
3,Got Stuck,"I was really excited to try this out and to never buy tampons again. Unfortunately, the cup ended up getting stuck. After a few hours of myself and my boyfriend trying to get it out with no success, I nearly went to the hospital to have it removed. Luckily, I was determined and was finally able to get it out. I'm a little freightened after this incident. I will probably have to gather some courage before using the cup again."
1,Leaks,"I have tried to use this product for a few months now. It was hard to get it in the first few times, but I quickly got the hang of it. Taking it out was a different story, however!It takes me a good 5 to 10 minutes to break the suction to pull it out. My hands get covered in blood and mucus! Ewww! There is no way that I would be able to empty it in a public bathroom.During the first 2 days of my periods, I have a heavy flow. I was always able to wear a Super tampon and a pantyliner with no problems, but for some reason, the Diva cups leaks within just one hour! The first hour it leaked, I emptied it and put it back in, and then put a pantyliner in my undies. Again, within the hour I leaked! This cycle kept continuing all day! I'm getting so frustrated! It works fine when my flow is light, but I really hate getting my hands so dirty! It's just not worth it to me."
1,Did NOT work for me!,"I purchased a Diva Cup, thinking it would be easier than tampons and pads, alleviating some of the stress of a period. It arrived with perfect timing, so I could use it that night. After inserting the cup, I fainted! I didn't insert it the wrong way, it slid up! I went to sleep, while still dizzy and worried, and woke up the next day to find that I could not take it out. I had to go see the doctor that day to have him help me remove the darn thing. Worst experience of my life, and even the doctor had a lot of trouble with it! I can't even return it now, since they kept it in the doctor's office. I appreciate that this product may work wonders for some women, but for me, it's a no-go!"
5,"Save waste, save time, save money... what more can you ask?!?!","Okay, yes, the Diva cup took getting used to (and by that I mean a few days), and I needed to trim the stem almost completely off. But, once you get it to fit you properly, it's seriously the BEST THING EVER!1) No need to worry about running out of tampons2) You only change it twice a day3) You can swim, take a bath, exercise, camp, etc etc etc, and not have to get waterlogged, or bring extra supplies4) Do your part to help the planet and reduce waste! Think of how many tampons you use a month, now multiply that times 12, and then times years that you've been using them... now imagine that in a landfill. Stop the waste cycle associated with your cycle!5) Never worry about overflow again.I can't say enough good things about this. I've been using it for about a year now, and will never go back!"
1,I wish it worked for me....,I ordered this product direct and I started using it immediately. It's a little awkward at first but once you get use to it you dont feel it at all. My problem with it is that I have leakage and I hate that feeling. Tampons work much better for me. A couple of reasons for this might be because my muscles are weak and I have't done any Kegel excersises to make them work better but the other problem is that my flow is quite heavy and the consistency is on the watery side. I hope I'm not grossing anybody out but I'm trying to help someone to decide if this product is right for them. I'm perimenopausal and I wish that it would have worked because not only is the DivaCup environmentaly frienldy but it would have also saved me a whole lot of money. You can send it back in case your wondering. They want you to be satisfied with their product.
4,"Takes a little practice, but I love not having to feel like I'm on my period.","Ok, so it took me a few tries to figure out how this cup fits in well. I would also recommend that you urinate soon AFTER you put in and take out the cup so you avoid any chances of getting a UTI, especially when learning. Besides these things, it's really nice to feel like I'm not on my period (not having the feeling of something flowing out all the time) and also feel like I'm helping the planet by not throwing away so much waste."
2,Great Concept - Not For Everyone,"I wanted this to work for me. It hurt. Even with lube. I got it in but the little stick part on the end poked me no matter what way I turned it. Taking it out almost made me scream. I think I have fibroids or some other garbage going on. I may also be too 'inexperienced'. It's a cramped space. The model 1 was too big for me.I trust the person who recommended this and I think it's going to be a great product for a lot of women. If you're primarily celibate, have fibroids, or find sex painful, this isn't for you."
5,Love it!,"I first bought this product thinking I could reduce my waste each month and save the environment a little bit at a time. I read reviews on it and every site I visited had some people who loved it and some people who just couldn't get the hang of it. Well I used it the very first chance I got and it worked great. I had no problem getting it in or out, and found it was just as cleanly as tampons or pads. It feels a lot healthier. It works great. It is relatively cheap considering the cost per year of tampons. I would absolutely recommend it. If you can use a tampon than you should have no problems."
2,It's HUGE!,"This was the first menstrual cup I ever tried, and I was a bit intimidated by the size. I tried it out, and there was only one afternoon where I couldn't feel it. And you have to completely cut off the stem. Overall, the idea is FANTASTIC, but it's HUGE. I ordered a MeLuna online, and was shocked and relieved that it was HALF the size of the diva cup. I can't feel it at all. And I didn't have to remove the stem. Also, it's made of a different material that you don't have to boil for 20 minutes monthly (just 5)... If you've had children or bleed ALOT (i hardly filled it at all) it might work, but do some research on the products and sizes. It's HUGE. And I got the smaller of the two diva cups."
5,A Dream Come True,"One of the best purchases I have ever made. The Diva Cup finally gives a woman freedom from her period, eliminating the need to purchase and carry around (non-environmental-friendly) tampons and pads, as well as reducing the risk of TSS to practically zero. Although it takes a bit of time to get used to the process of insertion and removal, as well as figuring out the heaviness of your flow and how often to change the cup (certainly no more than the tampon being changed every four hours), once you've got the idea, you don't have to worry about leaks. This cup has kept me unaware of my period even when performing strenuous physical activity (acrobatics, dance, etc), and is wonderful for swimming. It can also be worn overnight with no worries.One of the most highly recommended products I can suggest for menustrating women of any age."
3,big learning curve!,"This thing works WONDERFULLY when ""correctly"" inserted. If it leaks, you don't have it inserted properly. It is difficult to know when it IS inserted correctly, though. It is very difficult to insert, fairly easy to remove.I also recommend ordering a larger size based upon whether or not one has ever given birth. If you've never given birth, I recommend going with the smaller size, regardless of your age.I've read many reviews from women in their 30's and older who ordered the larger size and it was too big and uncomfortable. I'm 43 and the smaller size fits great."
4,Still Fits!,"I started using the Diva Cup before I had my child and it worked great. Now that I've had my son, it still fits and works great. I wouldn't go back to tampons and definitely wouldn't go back to pads on a regular basis. Sometimes I do still have to wear a pad when the flow is heavier, but it's not very often...and I already have a pretty large flow. I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want the hassle of conventional menstrual methods."
5,Wonderful Product!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased the Diva Cup, but it ordered to work far above my expectations. The product is easy to insert after a try or two. With the Diva Cup in place, I have never had a leak, unlike my previous experiences with tampons. I'm so happy that I will never again have to worry about chemical-laden and environmentally unfriendly feminine hygiene products. I would recommend this product to any woman wishing to simplify her monthly routine!"
3,Not for everyone,"I think it is a good quality product with few flaws. The firs thing I want to point out is that it isn't colored like it looks in the picture; it's just white. Not that this affects the quality or how well it worked. I just thought I was buying a pink cup. It's also quite large. I'm having a hard time getting it in, but I've read that that's normal. Overall, I like it."
3,no leaks!,"I had no leaks with this product but there is a learning curve to inserting and removing the cup. I will use again and reccommend to anyone. Don't try to insert this if you are not on your cycle it will hurt! However, I had no discomfort when inserting after I started my period and could not feel it at all. I have not tried to remove and reinsert in a public restroom yet that seems complicated!"
5,Good for BV too!,"I bought this product based on the positive reviews and I agree that it is great once you get the hang of using it and make sure it is open inside you. I actually have an easier time if I put it in laying down on my bed. I change it before work and when I get off so about every 8 hours.Surprisingly, I bought this as a way to prevent the odor of my reocurring BV while at work and in between BV treatments. If you have chronic BV then you realize how horrible the discharge smells. I used to use tampons while at work to avoid the odor but I felt it wasn't the safest idea and it was getting expensive. The Diva Cup will catch all the smelly discharge and you are fine for the work day."
3,When it works it's great,"I heard a lot of positive things about the diva cup and menstrual cups in general. I was really excited about getting my diva cup and I did a lot of research on blogs and stuff. I thought it would be really easy to insert and use in general. For the most part it is but I quickly realized that I had a major learning curve to overcome. When I began my cycle I started to leak, and upon doing my research I realized that I may not have been lining up the diva cup with my cervix properly. I managed to get it to not leak only twice but for the most part I was leaking all over the place. The two times I got it in correctly gave me hope and I'm willing to give it another go. I'm mostly satisfied but a bit discouraged (for the time being)."
3,I can't use it,"I tried using it and couldn't get it to workI got it in and it never opened up. The stem was to long for me, too.Went with a soft cup instead..."
5,I will never go back to tampons!,"The Diva Cup is the greatest thing ever for women... no drying! no chemicals/bleach! no waste! a money-saver! and you don't feel it!I have to admit, I was a little bit worried about leakage at first but I've never had one though I do sleep with Lunapads just in case! The only tiny downside (which isn't enough to make me switch back) is that I prefer to empty the Diva Cup where I have a sink near by to give it a quick rinse which isn't really as possible for public washrooms... but that's my preference. And since you don't have to change it as often as a tampon, it really isn't that big a deal anyways!I will forever be a Diva Cup woman. Why would you even use tampons when something like this is available? I'm converting all my girl friends!"
4,Works well with a bit of patience,"Although I was skeptical about whether I could manage such an item, the idea of not buying another tampon or pad for the next ten years as well as not contributing to millions of feminine hygiene products filling landfills were just some of the reasons for which I was compelled to give it a go. The Diva Cup is a little awkward to use, but if you follow the instructions well, you should have no problems. Let's just say that it requires a little patience and practice. The great thing about it is that you can wear it for up to 10 hours without worrying about a thing, and you don't feel like you are wearing it - much the same with tampons. I bought Dr. Bronners unscented organic soap to clean it, and it works really well, and I always back the cup up with my Gladrags (for peace of mind). It's a little extra work than using tampons or pads, but the benefits far outweigh the little negative."
5,AWESOME.,"I LOVE MY DIVA CUP. Just like tampons, you do have to invest a little time to learn how to use it, but, trust me, it is worth it. I never leak, I feel cleaner, and it's great not to create so much waste. It gets rid of the headache that is your period, I get excited when my period comes just because I get to use it! BUY NOW."
4,Saving the world one menstrual cycle at a time,"This is a genius product. I realize there are many such products that exist or have been existing. I am a huge fan of the idea. It's easy to use. Method 2 for insertion is probably the easier. The only problem I have is the feeling of being sucked out from the inside when I remove the cup to empty its contents. I wish there were some other way that the seal could be broken. It's nice to think I may never need pads or tampons ever again. It's nice to think that I may make a huge impact through my life by preventing so much waste from ending up in a landfill. Highly recommended! Go buy yourself, your girlfriend(s), or any woman in your life a Diva Cup."
5,Every women should own one,Its a awesome product. It works as its suppose to and I usually forget I'm on my cycle. Amazon is great. Shipping was fast and free as usual.
5,LIFE CHANGING,"Came in a timely manner completely unharmed. This product has changed my life. I will no longer litter the world with bloody, environmentally hazardous cotton balls. Yay!"
5,Works wonderfully!,"This product does exactly what it's supposed to, and it does it well. I admit it was a bit confusing to get the hang of at first, but once I did, inserting and removing only took a few seconds. The cramps I would get from tampons are gone, and I know this will save me a lot of money in the long run! Plus, I rather enjoy how long I can leave it in (12 hours, apparently) so I don't feel pressured to replace it all the time. I would recommend this to any woman I know."
4,Love it!,"I was wary of the Diva Cup, not sure if I'd be able to handle insertion and removal, but I have been pleasantly surprised. The first month it's a bit difficult to get used to but it gets easier from there. I have a medium-heavy flow, and I love that on my heaviest days I only have to empty the cup once or twice. I have never had a leak and love that the Diva Cup is more discreet than pads or tampons, and also more comfortable."
1,Can't get it out,"I was looking forward to using this product, but I've tried it once or twice during each of my past four cycles and every time, I've struggled to remove it. I've tried every tip I can find online. I have no problem inserting it correctly. Maybe my vagina is longer than average, but it has been a stressful mess. Just something to think about."
5,Changes everything!,"I am so glad I bought this! There's no mess or leaking or fretting about having to change it or needing to rush to the store. The diva cup makes having a period easier in just about every way and its Eco-responsible. I love that aspect. I can't believe I was putting tampons and pads in landfills for so long. Using it is simple, too. I was a little nervous that it would take me a couple of tries to get the hang of it, but really I got it right the first time I used it. I highly recommend this product. Periods arent fun, but the diva cup makes them more bearable."
5,Great product in all ways.,"I can't think of anything bad to say about this product. It's good for the environment, cost-effective, less time-consuming than other products...The only warning I can give is to learn how to take out the devise. When I first tried this, I couldn't break the vacuum properly and it really hurt. Pinch it so that you take it out the same way you put it in.Definitely worth the time, money, and any misgivings."
2,Eh.,"I really wanted to like it and like it enough that I could ditch using pads forever. I practiced with it beforehand, so I was sure I was putting it in right. I put it in during the first day of my period, and somehow it AMPLIFIED my cramps to levels I couldn't handle. Granted, it worked perfectly. Collected all of the blood and kept it from leaking out. But dang. So uncomfortable. Ah well."
5,"Once you go Cup, you never go back!","This is an absolutely amazing product, It's great for women who dislike the discomfort of traditional menstrual supplies such as pads and tampons, which can feel uncomfortable and even painful in the case of tampons (especially at the tail end of your cycle).The Diva Cup does have a bit of a learning curve, but once you get used to it, and figure out the best way to insert/remove it for YOUR BODY, then it'll be a breeze. You pretty much forget you even have it in because it's comfortable, doesn't leak (if you put it in right), and cleans easily. No more smelly trash bins, midnight runs to the store, or begging for supplies off a stranger.For me it also made me cramp less during my period. I don't really know the science behind that, but I'm thankful for it!"
5,Recommended!,"At first I wasn't sure, but it really does work great after you get the hang of it. This makes my period much more tolerable. I can sleep through the night without having to get up and change a tampon or without having to stay completely motionless so my pad won't start to leak. On my heaviest day I probably have to change it every four hours but after that I can leave it in for the whole 12 hours before emptying it. And no more ruined underwear...it does not leak if you put it in correctly."
5,not looking back - way better than tampons!,"The title says it all. The first couple times using this are uncomfortable/tricky, but it gets much easier. In most circumstances, this is way better than all other alternatives."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was skeptical when I received the Diva cup from a family member, but I was pleasantly surprised. The first 2 or 3 insertions and removals were difficult, but it was easy to get the hang of. Cleaning the cup isn't difficult, but is better in a private bathroom, or at least one with a sink with the stall. I can usually last 10 hours on my heaviest flow days, so public restrooms aren't really a problem. I would definitely recommend this product. Virgins wanting to try this product, beware that you can break your hymen, so if you're worried about that I would not suggest using the Diva cup."
3,It makes my abdomen cramp a little,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail. Little did I know it would take me weeks just to get the damn thing in. When I finally was able to insert in at the start of my next cycle I felt so accomplished...until my stomach started to hurt. At first I thought it was just my regular menstrual cramps, but as soon as I removed the cup the cramps immediately went away. Besides the cramps, I found out that I had been leaking the whole time. I tried inserting it again, but I still felt the cramps and I leaked even more. I ended up just buying some tampons. I guess maybe it was sitting too high up in my vagina, but I'm still pretty frustrated considering I spent quite a bit on this thing."
4,"The wonderful, reusable diva cup!","I love my diva cup. I want to first start off with the positives, the first being that it is reusable and easy to clean. I love that now I don't have to worry about always having a tampon or pad with me. the diva cup definitely gives you a good peace of mind.The only negative i have for this is that it can be a bit difficult to take out at times. Make sure to stay relaxed, and give yourself some time when you first purchase it to get used to putting it in and taking it out."
3,Not good with NuvaRing (or heavy bleeders),"It took a few months to get used to the NuvaRing and insert it correctly, but I would still leak at times... I think because I'm a pretty heavy bleeder. I still loved the product so I would just wear the Diva Cup with a panty liner or pad (I would do this with a tampon anyway).However, shortly after getting comfortable with the Diva Cup, I got on the NuvaRing birth control and my NuvaRing sits fairly low so it interferes with the DivaCup's suction :( By the time I start my period, it is about time to put a new NuvaRing in so I do not use the Diva Cup much anymore. Bummer!"
1,I'll be blunt,"I heard about this product from a married friend of mine who gave it rave reviews. After researching it on the internet, I was convinced I needed one. It came today and I decided to give it a try before starting my period. I wish I had never bought it. I cannot insert the thing. I am a virgin and am only 16 years old. Trying to insert the cup caused bleeding from a small tear in my hymen and right now I'm very sore. I'm not sure if that is the problem, but it hurt so much I don't really want to try again. I think the whole idea is wonderful. I just wish it worked for me!"
3,I hope it does its job,"I bought this product a couple weeks ago and decided to do a dry run. It was actually painful to insert and remove but after the second time I tried, it wasn't bad, so I hope when that time of the month comes it will be able to do it's job."
1,Do not buy if you're a virgin.,"Im a 15 year old virgin and it is physically impossible to insert this thing in your vagina without probably breaking your hymen in the process!Terrible waste of money. No matter how relaxed you are, if you can't fit more than one finger in your hoo-haa you will not be able to fit this."
5,would never go back to disposables,"I love this product. I never have any problems with leakage. I am producing less waste once a month and don't have to lose a week everymonth. I can swim, jog, or do anything."
5,Can't imagine another option!,"I have done my best to spread the word on this cost effective completely affective feminine product. Easy to use.And because I am so simple to please, I was most delighted by the little satchel and pin that came in the packaging."
5,just right,"I bought and started using my Diva Cup in December of 2007. I love this little thing! No hassle and worry over having to run to CVS at 11pm because I'm out of tampons. No dried out vag at the end of the period. No cares about having to hide the wad of feminine hygene products in my pocket on the way to the company bathroom. And best of all in my opinion NO WASTE (packaging excluded)!!! Admittedly there is a bit of learning involved and there is minor leakage to consider. And I'm talking 'minor', never any more leakage than your run of the mill tampon. Don't spend your money on any more 'products' meant to bleach the snot out of your puss and pad the wallets of corporations who make a mint on women's insecurities. It's your body, and women have had periods since the beginning of time, no need to treat it like an inconvenience or something that needs to be sterilized and sealed away from yourself. This product is more than an alternative, it's a statement. Get it, you won't look back."
2,Will it fit you?,"Menstrual Cups are WONDERFUL! But they are not ""one size fits all."" Whether small or large, Diva Cups are the longest cups on the market at 57mm and therefore probably won't fit those with short vaginal canals or those whose cervix drops low during their periods.There are 8 different brands of cups and they are all different sizes and shapes. Research Menstrual Cups to make an educated guess as to which one might fit you best before you buy one so you don't waste your time and money on a cup that is the wrong size. A VERY helpful site is [...]"
1,it didn't work for me.. i wish that it did..,"it didn't work for me. i experienced nothing but leaks when i used this product, and the diva cup was too long(i later discovered that i had a low cervix).ladies, do not buy if you have a low cervix!"
2,It leaks,"I'm 27 years old with no kids and I bought this product thinking it would eliminate my need to buy and wear tampons, pads etc. I was wrong! It leaks constantly, don't know why..I put it in the right way and everything but for some reason it doesn't seem like its the right fit for me. My period is heavy the first 2 days and thats, of course when it leaks the most. Also its very messy to clean. When u first take it out you run the risk of spilling it on yourself! Pretty disgusting, especially if you don't have access to washing your hands right away. Honestly, I wouldn't have bought it knowing all these things. Gross!"
5,Pleasantly surprised!,"I had been looking at the Diva Cup for a few months before I decided to actually buy one. I was pretty apprehensive, because I'm very small and didn't think I would be able to get it in without a lot of difficulty and/or pain. It arrived in the mail yesterday and I tried it out, and seriously could not BELIEVE how easy and painless it was. I was able to insert it in one try, and it took about 10 seconds. I haven't been able to use tampons for about a year since I started taking birth control because it made my periods so light, and I really hated using pads, so this is absolutely perfect for me. I really wasn't sure about this, but I am so so so glad I bought one. It's so much easier than you think it is going to be, and I'm actually kind of looking forward to my period so that I can try it out then.I would honestly recommend this product to anyone!"
4,I think I like it,I have never felt so free on my period! I love the fact that i don't really have to worry about changing tampons or pads constantly! The only problem is that it is a bit hard to get in and out sometimes. It feels weird for a few seconds. It also leaks a bit between dumpings because blood does continue to drip down while you're cleaning it. I would never dump this in a public restroom. I can't even imagine the mess! Yuck... but i do like this product because i feel free!
4,Great Environmentally Friendly Alternative,"I really loved being able to use this product instead of constantly having to throw away the disposable pads and tampons. I gave it a four because I still wore a panty liner with the divacup in case I didn't get it sealed correctly. It's small, convenient, and easy to clean. I'm sad that I only got it about four months before I got pregnant!"
5,Revolutionary product!,"The Diva Cup is definitely a little difficult to get used to, but once you do, it is an amazing product! I'm happy I got over my worries and just purchased it."
3,I'm not sure...,"I think the concept of this product is great! It would save so much money and is much cleaner to deal with than tampons. My only concern (and I'm not sure that this product caused my problem) is that when I first used this product it seemed to pinch a nerve and make my legs numb a bit. I also had some issue with the pull nub. I could feel it awfully when I put it in at first, so I cut it. After cutting it the aggravation was even worse. I finally had to cut it all the way to the top of the nub. It's not as awkward feeling since I did that, and I can still reach it just fine. I am hoping that I am able to wear this more comfortably in the future."
1,wouldn't stay in place,"I tried it a few times, but after having a freakout everytime it was time to remove it, I tossed it in the trash. Maybe because I got the pre-childbirth model, it kept slipping into the uterus. Maybe I have a longer canal, but basically, it wasn't working for me."
5,i am happy with the product,"Usefull, it helps to prevent the global warming... and help with the care of the enviroment. i like it. i already use it for and experiment with stem cells but you can use it for all the thinks i said."
4,Interesting Idea,"I like that it's a ""green"" product, and that I only have to buy one a year. It takes some used to, getting it in and out. Once my cycle was done, I felt like I needed to do some kegel exercises. I have the Model 1 Pre-Childbirth, and it's huge! Also, if you're going to be traveling, you want to make sure you have potable water to clean it with. This is important. If you're going to a country where it's hard to find clean drinking water, you might want to take it into consideration. I use water with Dr. Bronner's mild castile soap. Works great. You can leave it in up to 12 hours, which is nice. Boil it for 20 minutes after your cycle is over. The instructions are very detailed for use and cleaning."
5,Absolutely great product!,"I bought the Diva Cup after reading about the harmful chemicals that can often be found in tampons, and myself not being a pad user either.When I received my Diva Cup, I immediately inspected it. It appeared to be made with quality. It came with very thorough and helpful instructions as to care and use.Upon use, I saw how very comfortable and unnoticeable my Diva Cup was. It was much more convenient to change it once or twice a day than to run to the bathroom frequently as I used to.I would recommend this product to anyone with an open mind."
1,Feels like a football up you know where,"No mater what i do this thing just feels like a giant football up in my lady land. My other issue is that as soon as its in i constantly feel like i need to urinate. I dont get it, i sqweeze it/fold it make origami out of it and its just not comfortable. I wanted to have success with this product but it just doesnt seem to work for me. Trying to get it out was nearly impossible, i had an extremely hard time trying to get my fingers situated so i could break the suction and get it out."
2,Darn it...wanted this to work.,"I am so happy for all of you who can wear your Diva Cup. Alas I am not one of the fortunate ones. At age 52 I am depressed that I still need any feminine protection. I gave the Diva Cup a good try... but I must be too short. I watched all the YouTube videos and read everything possible on the tips and tricks of use. I have had the same problem with tampons all my life. I've only found one brand short enough for me to use. Don't let this turn you against trying the product if you have never had a problem with tampons being too long, I think the Diva Cup might work for you. However, I hope I saved others some money if you suspect you might have a short canal too. Another thing, if you have long nails...I want you to imagine having to ""run your finger around the outer rim of your Diva Cup"" to make sure you have the proper seal, this is while it is inserted mind you, during your period of course..ugh."
5,Worth It!,"I had discovered the joys of using softcup last year and I really liked it, but I found myself still rinsing them out and reinserting them. After doing this for multiple periods I knew I was ready to try diva cup. I can say that I really enjoy it! I had a hard time initially getting it not to leak (because I was putting it in wrong), but after a day of practice things are great and I can totally tell when it is time to empty it. No complaints, especially from my wallet!"
5,love it,"Like any menstrual cup, it takes a little ""getting used to"" but the pay-off is always worth it. It's smooth and sits fine, and now I actually prefer it to the one I was replacing (femmecup brand) mainly for comfort reasons. Of course, every woman's cervix is a little different, so do your research to find out which cup is right for you before you purchase one!"
5,Any Woman Not Using This is SERIOUSLY Missing Out.,"Diva Cup is the greatest thing ever. I was skeptical at first, but because of my concern for the environment (and my finances) I decided to give it a shot. I wish I had been using this since I started using tampons (I wasted so much time and money!). Once you get the hang of it (which is incredibly easy), you will be sorry that you ever used anything else. I just fold in in half, but it up there and then insert a finger to unfold it. Biggest perk: it NEVER leaks. I empty it twice a day; it's like I'm not even having my period. Make SURE that you use the prescribed Diva Cup wash, however. I tried other things and, well, just don't do it. It seems expensive, but one bottle lasts forever, and you and your Diva Cup will thank you. The Diva Cup is great for the environment, it's economical, and it's so, so effective (you'll hate tampons after you've used this)."
5,I'm a Diva!,"I absolutely love my Diva Cup! I work long shifts at work and its so nice not having to worry about changing out tampons or making sure that if it didn't hold it's own I didn't ruin another pair of undies. I have had no trouble at all with the insertion or removal of the cup, it does help to have some good kegel muscles to help with removal, and a little bit of fingernail too for grip. I'm using it for the second cycle since I received it as a gift and I assure you I will not be going back to tampons, not to mention buying a box every month or so and going through tons of toilet paper trying to wrap it discretely so I don't gross my fiancé out -_-I'm a Diva for life!"
5,Love it,"I was nervous about purchasing a diva cup because I had read about the dreaded learning curve concerning menstrual cups in general. But now I am SO happy I decided to buy this! It does take a few tries to figure out which folds work best for you, and the easiest way to get it to pop open once its inserted, but once you figure it out its smooth sailing! I am back on the market for a shorter cup (the diva is one of the longest cups available, measuring in at 60 something millimeters including stem- most are between 40-55 depending on size and brand) so thats definitely something to take into consideration before you purchase. I cut the stem off mine though and its ok for now. Overall I would absolutely recommend the diva cup. Im not a slave to my period anymore and its pretty awesome :)"
5,Very nice product,"So far, this works great. It doesn't leak, it's easy to clean, and of course, I don't get caught off-guard and find that I have no tampons. The only negative things I have to say about DivaCup is that it's a little trickier to put in than a tampon (but still pretty easy) and I hate the name. But I highly recommend it to anyone who uses tampons, because it's only a little more difficult and you only have to have one!"
4,informative and a pleasure to read,"I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The title doesn't do it justice. It should be calld something like Portugal, a cultural and literary companion. It is true, the focus is on Lisbon, but it goes far beyond. Through the sights of Lisbon, it gives the reader an overall view of Portugal's history, literature, cinema, painting, etc.There is only one negative aspect. Why are there so many misspellings in the Portuguese words? Not even the name of navigator Vasco da Gama escapes. I almost wish I couldn't speak the language so I would not notice the mistakes and could then give this book more than four stars. Still an excellent book."
3,Informative but boring,"This book contains a lot of information about Lisbon, both as a city to be visited and as a city which has inspired novels, films, etc., and the educated tourist can find this book very useful. Unfortunately, I found the book boring. Somehow, I failed to relate to it. Maybe if I had heard of Tabucci and these other cultural figures, I might have gotten something more out of it. I visited Lisbon in 1966 and enjoyed it, and I am fluent in Portuguese, so the problem is hardly Lisbon. But the book just seemed to me to never get off the ground."
3,Very complicated,"This book is difficult to follow, medical training probably would help. I found it intimidating."
5,Totally Fun!!!!,"I was at Lime Rock Racetrack in Connecticut in May 2005 and saw this car on the seat of a sportscar people were oogling. Extremely curious of the book - I found the car owner, had him open the car and read the book. I was in love - my students, who design racecars and a racetrack in my art class would love it, so I came home and ordered it!!! My 2 year old niece gets a kick out of the sing/song and adores the illustrations - which my students find all the dual meanings to! I just met the author at another Lime Rock race and bought 2 more books - ENJOY!!!"
5,Great book for toddlers!,My 2 year old son received this book for his birthday a few months ago and he has demanded that we read it every night since. A great spin-off of the classic childrens' song and the illustrations are beautiful!
4,Wheels on the race car,"A fun variation on ""wheels on the bus."" We got this book from the library, and our son really liked it, so we purchased it. He loves the race cars and the animal drivers."
5,What a great idea!,I always hated wasting a whole sheet of tinfoil just to heat up a piece of pizza - I'm so glad I found this! Works great! Just wipe off and use again!
1,works but too big,"works very well,but it doesn't fit in a toaster oven tray it's about an inch too long.I tried looking for another tray that would be a better fit but all toaster oven trays are about 10x7 inches.this silpat is 11x8 inches. why would they say it's toaster oven size when it's a little too big?"
5,"Thought is wasn't great, but is!","I thought this Silpat was to be placed in the bottom of the toaster oven to catch butter, cheese, etc. spills. I put it there anyway, and yes, it caught the spills, but some of 'um just went down and underneath the Silpat, and onto the aluminum tray. NOT GOOD! So, I looked in through my supply of cookie sheets and found one that this small Silpat would fit. Then I baked cookies. Oh, the cookies came out great. No burnt bottoms or edges. More like a bakery. I made ""trash"" and it never burned either. This is a fantastic kitchen tool. I would like to have one for all my cookie sheets."
1,"DeMarle mislabels, Amazon fails to check","I have no doubt that the Silpat is a good product, but I cannot confirm that from my own experience. I ordered a DeMarle Toaster Oven Silpat with dimensions 10.9"" by 7.9"" and received a DeMarle 10E Silpat with dimensions 24.5"" x 16.5"". DeMarle had placed a sticker on the 10E wrapper that identified it as a ""Toaster Oven Silpat"". I returned the oversized Silpat to receive one of the correct size, and once again Amazon sent me the DeMarle 10E - a repeat of the error that it was intended to rectify. I am awaiting a third Silpat from Amazon, and hoping that Amazon will check the actual size this time before sending it to me. (Or they could send me a 26"" x 18"" toaster oven.)"
1,Damaged Goods,The Silpat arrived with a large blemish on what I assume to be the bottom. The smooth plastic coating looked like it ran when applied and did not cover the interior mesh.
2,Very disappointed,Bark George. Very strange story. I hesitate to give it to my 6 year old granddaughter. Don't understand the high rating.
5,My daughter's favorite book!,"My nine-month old daughter absolutely adores this book! She relishes turning each page and giggles all the way through it. I usually read it to her 2 to 3 times in a row and when I motion to put it away, she cries! Any book that can get an infant excited about reading is really something special."
4,Cute story but . . .,"The story is really cute, and the illustrations are funny even of mother dog's expressions of concern. It has an ending I didn't expect and it was not predictable; a pleasant surprise. But,why would anyone write an amusing story like this one and deliberately misuse the English language? George and mother misuse the words ""go"" and ""went"" throughout the book. George ""went"" nine times in the book and really didn't go anywhere; he just sat there trying to bark. The usage of the word ""go"" by the mother is equally disturbing. For example the mother dog says: ""Cats go meow"" and ""Dogs go arf."" What ever happened to the words ""said"" or even better ""replied""? The English language takes a beating in everyday usage. At least the written word for children should be correct. I'm sure my grandchildren will find this book funny for it is a happy story. I would not have purchased this book had I known of the English faux pas."
2,bark at you,"I liked the story, that's why I ordered the book, but I could have bought a used library book much cheaper than the shipping and handling charges at a local library book sale. I was disappointed with this purchase."
5,My story-time children LOVE this book!,We read this book at Preschool Story Time - the group ranges from two to five years old - and the children LOVED it. Everyone was arfing and meowing and oinking and quacking. And saying HELLO. What a great book!
5,Hilarious!!,"This is by far one of my favorite childrens books. I enjoy reading Bark, George as much (or maybe more!) as my 4 year-old. This is a great spending time together, and being silly book. I not only recommend this book for children, but also any ""grown-up"" who's still a kid at heart!"
5,Great Book!,I think this is a really good kindergarten book to read because it has alot of repetition which kids at this age need. The story-line is also really cute which keeps kids entertained.
5,One of our favorites!,"This book is chosen by both our 4 yr old and our almost-2 yr old *all the time* for reading (and we have 4 shelves of kids books). The 4 yr old laughs with the ""No, no -- dogs don't say 'quack'"" and the 2 yr old loves any book with animal sounds -- whether they are the correct ones for the animal or not. Fun reading and the twists still make us laugh each time we read it."
5,A fun book to read!,"Sitting on the floor of a dusty bookstore, my twin sons were mesmerized by the clerk reading this book. They love the various animal sounds and figuring out what animal SHOULD be making that noise. Reading it together ensures giggles and discussion . . . and a springboard into other literary activities such as pointing to various stuffed animals and figuring out ""what is inside them?"" It is both a must read and a learning experience all between two covers."
2,Weak Tea.,"Yeah, this one is neither fish nor fowl. It includes some good footage and interviews with members of the beat generation, but its attempt to dramatize Kerouac's life are unfulfilling. The acting is sixth rate, and the actors themselves don't look much at all like Jack or Neal Cassady. I think it was a great idea to have an actor read passages from Kerouac's work, but even this manages to grate as the sentences are read melodramatically and contaminated by too much emotion. Kerouac didn't sound like that, nor, from what I have read, did he think like that. This documentary was quite a disappointment and two other films are available on the tragic man which are far superior in quality."
5,Great Shortbread pan,This is a great pan for making shortbread. Much prefer it to the clay one it replaced.
3,"okay, not great",I was disappointed in the imprint the pan left on my cookies. I thought the pan's non-stick qualities were good and my cookies did not burn. I just wanted to see the imprint more!
2,Dont Bother,"I thought this corkscrew was made out of metal, but it is just a cheap piece of plastic. It does work ok but dont anticipate it will last long, definatelynot worth the $20 I spent on it."
3,Pretty expensive for what you get,"While it was good to see some interesting open salts, most of the items were things the average person will never see. I didn't find it very helpful."
3,I Had High Hopes,"In preparation for my sermon series on Malachi, I quickly picked up this book in hopes for some solid and engaging pastoral insight. I have a great deal of respect for the theological and pastoral chops of Boice, which is why this book fell a little flat for me.There were too many passages in Malachi where Boice compressed several sections of the Prophet into one rather short chapter. In doing so, there were times when he simply did not deal with some of the more provocative passages in Malachi. By the end of my study for the book, I found myself just skimming over his chapters to make sure I wasn't missing anything (and some gems were found), but overall, it just didn't deliver as I expected.If you are working on any of these minor prophets, I would recommend the NICOT or NIV Application Series to you first."
4,Critical criticism,"The history of the Catholic church is a difficult topic for writers. It can easily slip into either uncritical praise or uncritical criticism, and there is no way to tell which way is worse.This topic is especially hard for Mexican writers, because the Church in Mexico has been the object of bitter political disputes, which have several times degenerated into civil war.This book manages to criticize the church where it has to be criticized (for example, in the lucid chapter on the Inquisition), and yet it can show that many of her detractors (mainly rabidly anticlerical governments) were wrong, perhaps not as much in their ideas as in the means they followed to put them into practice.I like about this book that it is very concise and balanced, in point of view and in size. It is a practical handbook, not as lengthy as other histories of the church in Mexico (Mariano Cuevas', which is very hard to find).This is a very helpful reading for anyone eager to understand modern Mexico."
2,Knock on Wood: A Collection of Superstitions,"Knock on Wood by Linda Spencer is a collection of superstitions, organised by theme. Spencer has collected and described hundreds of North American and European superstitions, however, the book is lacking in that there is no background information given. Anyone interested in how the superstition developed will not be satisfied. Furthermore, there is no index, making it hard to cross reference superstitions involving more than one object. As there is also no bibliography, interested reader will find it impossible to trace sources.A far better collection is that offered by Claudia DeLys ""A treasury of superstitions"" which has a broader collection, delves into the history of particular superstitions and offers a detailed index and bibliography to boot."
4,Easy installation / Increased power,It took me less than 45 minutes to assemble and install this item on my '98 Cherokee (4.0L). All I needed were two wrenches and a screwdriver. I can definitely feel and hear the difference...maybe 10 additional horses. A good addition to an already stout engine.
5,DHEA,I have used it before and helps me with my hormones situation. I recommend it specially for mature person like me.
3,Nice,"A nice product. I recomend it because is useful for it purpose. Try it or buy it. Again, buy it."
4,Lovely sink faucet.,Product was delivered ahead of schedule. It is prettier than the picture and is of very good quality. Only time will tell if it is a good value for the money. So far it works just fine and easy to maintain.
3,"Fifth Angel : ""Time Will Tell""","Not as solid as their debut in my opinion. It's still very good, and has that great melodic FA feel, but the songs just don't have as much content as their debut, and they seem to be leaning towards the cheesier taste of Metal here....I absolutely loved Fifth Angel, the debut, but for some reason this just isn't up to thei standards as far as keeping the listener interested. The songs are just too ""cream filled""... 3 1/2...."
4,THE LAST FLIGHT OF FIFTH ANGEL,"I had purchased their first recording FIFTH ANGEL which was awesome so i just had to buy this. I wasnt disapointed this is a fantastic recording it isnt as raw or powerful as their first offering however it was more melodic. The twin guitar attack even in the slower songs are special and the vocals are strong. The highlights are CATHEDRAL ( best on the album ) seven hours, Time will tell , & feel the heat. Sadly after this offering the band broke up which is such a shame, Very very underated, which with a stroke of luck this band could have been successful"
2,Leaves out Project 2002 Server,"I must humbly disagree with the other reviewers. It is important to point out that this book does not provide ANY information related to the Server product, which is the predominant reason people would move up to Project 2002. For example, go to the index and look up ""Spooler error"" and there won't be a single reference. Look up ""Enterprise"" as in resources and there won't be anything. This book is purely for Project 2002. Her style of writing is very nice so I wish that she would write a companion book on Project Server which really needs some troubleshooting guides right now!"
2,MS Project for Dummies?,"This book is extremely basic and offers no help to those with real project troubleshooting issues. It's really a ""step-by'-step"" for the project novice. If you are just getting started with project, and have little or no MS office or computer skills, this book is for you. If you are looking for best practice tips and techniques, or help in solving real-world project issues, move on to another title."
2,Not much help,I had hoped to get a better technical understanding of how Project functioned. Instead I got answers that I could have figured out for myself with no real insight given. Hence why the used price of this book is so low.
4,Wood Shop Vise,"A good vise for the money. I like the fit and finish of it and the finer thread pitch on the screw. Good for wood products. The stop can come in handy. I just had to ream out the mounting holes to accept 1/4""-20 bolts and the holes in one of the jaws for #12 machine screws to affix MDF. MyToolPlace is a good source for tools and accessories."
1,Not for Windows 7,"Buyer Beware...If you have Windows 7, PhotoImpact 5 is not for you. I bought this based on a previous review stating this would work on Windows 7. IT DOES NOT !!! Do not buy PhotoImpact 5 if you plan on installing it on a Windows 7 machine.I used PhotoImpact a good bit a few years ago, and it was pretty simple to use and create/edit simple images and photos on the web or for print. It has some pretty cool things you can do with photos. I bought this with anticipation of using it to help me in creating some cool Calendar photo images. Ended up being a waste of money. It does work on Windows XP and I have resurrected on old XP machine just to test it out. Guess I'll be looking for something else."
4,Surprise!!,I had been looking for this CD for quite awhile. I was surprised to find it when I was looking for something that was similar to it. Thank you.
5,Fun read,"I got this book for my daughter who was doing a report on Estelle Getty . This book was both fun and interesting for my daughter to read. She learned things about ""Sophia"" she did not know before. This book helped immensely when doing her report."
1,Can't even find web info on blank device list,"Feeling pretty frustrated now. Haven't been able to back up anything, yet because novabackup can't find any devices to backup to. No help in manual, nothing on their website, and after 30 days you have to pay for support. I feel like I wasted my money, and wish I could select less than one star."
4,very good and inspiring,i really loved this book. i have read it about three or four times. it really inspires me to be as successful as she was at reaching her goals.
3,Pretty good,"I enjoyed this book. Parts were pretty funny. The fat counting is pretty old news now but I imagine it was of more interest when it was written. What a jerk Diana's husband was!! He was really pretty funny though. Chris seemed just about perfect. If not for JoJo, maybe he would have been. Diana did not seem to live a very moral life once she separated, lost weight, and was sought after. A bad example for her kids. But I liked the book anyway."
5,Great Book,"I read this book back in the early 90's and it actually helped me lose weight! I just read it again and it all came back to me how good this book is and somewhat of an inspiration for women....I recommend this one for a good read, with laughs and a few weeping moments."
4,The history and science of oceanography,"Much of this book is written in the first person, which in places makes it very appealing, but in other places is distracting. My other gripe is that she jumps around a bit in her life time - so one chapter she talks about being the only woman on an expedition, and then she is the 1990's leader of NOAA and then we are back to her childhood haunts and back again.That being said, it is a good read, full of facts and history. She worked in the sciences back when women were uncommon in the field. Back when there was no scuba gear and Jacques Cousteau was in to spear fishing, not conservation. Interesting stories, indeed! So, if you want an account of oceanography, past and present, its extreme limits and cool equipment from a personal point of view, pick this one up."
5,"Even if you've never seen the ocean, you need to read this.","It was a real awakening reading this book. I now see that everything we do affects the ocean. Dr. Earle shares amazing experiences and insights through her ambitious career. It's a beautifully-written and genuine book that allows you to enjoy a sense of adventure and wonder, while also taking in the reality of escalating threats on the blue heart of our planet. Dr. Earle makes a powerful case that we have only a small ten year window to save the ocean on which our health and well-being depends. If everyone read this book, dramatic and important sea changes would begin tomorrow."
2,Funny but Inappropriate,"Only let your young daughter watch this movie if it is ok to sneak out of the house at 14 years old, get in a friends car, play tricks on a rent a cop, set up a date on the internet, sneak into a night club, have drinks with her teacher, sneak into a boys house, watch him undres and then lie to her parents about the whole thing.oh yes, the premise was shallow...But... I did laugh. The line ""for the love of carbs"" was priceless."
1,Okay,"This movie is very teenage drama. At one point the girls sneak out and go to a high school dance just to get a lunch seat at the so called ""fountain"""
5,"Sleepover, The # 1 movie of all time.","Sleepover is the normal tween flick. Though, it's the best one I have seen for a long time. (i'm 12) It has characters that you can relate to. Let me tell you about it.It begins with Julie and her friends graduating from jr. high. Julie throws a sleepover with Hannah and Farrah but she decides to invite Yancy at last minute. It begins as a normal sleepover-loud music, dancing, nail polish etc. til the popular group steps in.Staci and her clic dare Julie and hers to a scavenger hunt. whoever wins gets to eat at the fountain... And that's just the beginning. Be prepared for laughs and more laughs.Look out for Spongebob. Look and adore him, but don't even think about it. He is SO mine. *sigh* Don't you dare even think about him. He is hot. And funny. And adorable. And... You get the point.I luv Russell."
2,alrighttt.....,"over all i dont really kno what happened considering i fell asleep during the movie..if any movie makes me fall asleep, its reall bad then.ps-the nap was good though!"
1,Damaged dvd,"The ""Sleepover"" DVD arrived damaged and scratched. I returned it to Amazon. It was supposed to have been ""brand new"", and it obviously was not."
4,Sleepover,"I bought this movie for my daughter and i decided to sit with her and view it. I loved it, its about a group of teenage girls,On one side you have the "" good girls "" and on the other side you have the ""obnoxious"" rich girls. They make a bet to see who can go on a scavenger hunt and make it to the party with all the items. The team that did this the fastest would win. It kind of reminds me of another movie where the boy ends up playing basketball with his friends in red thongs. Its awesome, I recommend it to those still young at heart and full of adventure!!!!!!!"
4,Pathetically cheesy...but that's what makes it so great,"I'm one of those people that just love cheesy chick flicks. And this movie is no exception. There were many times in the movie when I just couldn't help thinking, ""What are the odds of that?"" ""That would never happen in real life."" (Like when Steve sees Julie skateboarding in the red dress and suddenly decides that he likes her.) But movies like this are not meant to show real life. Funny, cheesy, unrealistic, happily-ever-after stories never hurt anyone."
5,Pretty good amazingly,"Looking at the cover you just may think of it as another bubblegum pop middle school cheap movie, But really good for anyone 10 + (Do to some mild sensuality and teen dating)."
4,Hokey Smoke,I love the words in this book. Snidely Whiplash! The Frostbite Falls Picayune Intelligence. I grew up thinking that comedy is the joy that comes with reversals of meaning brought about by quick changes in what anyone was thinking. This book is a reminder of how Mr. Know-It-All is a fathead. Like an injection of blabber mouth juice. I can't get over the jokes. There is something like useful information for people who wonder how this kind of thing gets on Tee Vee.
4,Easy installation,"I just installed this router and was a bit doubtful if it would live up to its name. Actually, the installation is pretty straightforward and, in about 20 minutes, I had wireless in every corner of my house."
3,great TV but light is loud on mine,"Not a huge AV enthusiast, but wanted good future-proof value TV and after a lot of research, this was it. Got a great deal, took it home and hooked it up. Picture is awesome. I noticed that it has a loud hum, and again research on the internet helped and revealed it was likely the color wheel. Technician from Conn's just came out and said nothing is wrong with the set. I have seen other DLPs and never heard a hum that loud. Tech said is was coming from bulb and it is working fine. There is no way it is that loud under normal circumstances. Movie gets quiet and it is super noticeable. Neighbor's Samsung 57' or something DPL makes no noise. Now I know there isn't much sound deadening in this room, but still... I am not sure what to do now. Anyone else experienced this? I don't know if I can live with a TV that costs that much and makes that much noise. I will continue to research and will update this review b/c other than that, this TV is awesome."
5,Everything I expected,"Researched quite a bit before buying this unit. Initially had difficulty trying to set it up, as I could not seem to get past the channel setting (which doesn't work or need to work when you have a cable box). I'm still not quite sure how I got to the window which allowed me to select my cable input-I'm just glad it happened! I'm not the most tech savvy in the world, as my kids will testify. Picture is great! I was getting some wavy screen action, particularly when pop ups appeared on screen, but that evidently was the cable system- for the past 3 weeks it has been awesome. Bought it for less than 1500, it arrived about a week later in perfect condition...a great bargain and awesome TV!"
1,known product defect + impossible service,"If you want to spend thou$ands for your next television - and have it rarely in operation, this is the TV for you!It's a known issue with the unit constantly and without reason shutting itself down 'because the airflow is blocked.' This is a known defect on Mitsubishi's projection models. Just google 'Mitsubishi Television Air Flow'Mitsubishi does everything in its power to make it impossible to reach them. There are efforts underway to start a class action lawsuit.So once again, our $2,500 TV is in the shop. Don't make the same error."
1,Great Picture - plagued with problems,"Purchased our DLP WD-52631 set in Feb 06. Within 6 months set was giving warning that lamp was overheating and would shut down. After several attempts from foreign support, tech came and worked on thermistor. About 1 month past warranty, bulb failed. Replaced and put an additional fan on the side of the set running continously. Set still goes off after a few months, three to five times a day. Search the internet for continuous string of testimonies concerning overheating problems in rooms that are actually cool. Will never buy Mitsubishi again. As mentioned, poor quality, poor service."
1,Don't buy this TV,"I bought this TV back in Dec 2007 have already had it in the shop to replace the power ballast (under warranty - after 10 months), replaced the lamp at 13 months, and now have to get it back into the shop to replace what is probably the main board. This is a huge disappointment in Mitsubishi, paricularly since seeing so many other posts on quality items with this same set. Do youself a favor and buy an LCD, preferably NOT Mitsibushi."
1,Don't buy this TV !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased my Mitsubishi WD-52631 52"" 1080 DLP HDTV in December 2007, less than one year later the bulb went. Even though they tried to get out of replacing it, they reluctantly sent a new one. That one lasted about 13 months and mitsubishi says that it is now my problem. A repair shop inspected the TV and found nothing wrong but the bulb. I expected at least 5-10 years with out a problem after spending about 2 grand for a TV. But according to Mitsubishi it normal to spend $250 on a bulb every year. Not only does mitsubishi not stand behind their defective product they expect to profit even more from their defective product. I will never buy a Mitsubishi product ever again and hope enough people read all the reviews and do the same."
4,cherry monroe,"My initial thought of Cherry Monroe and their CD The Good, The Bad & The Beautiful, was that they were just another one of those bands you could write off as pop/punk and that you couldn't tell them apart from many other bands. After I actually got a hold of their CD my mind changed instantly, and even though they still seem like a pop/punk band I was still able to find that their was a lot of originality that I couldn't see until they actually came to my school in Ellwood City, PA. Not only was their CD awesome, the guys are good looking with hearts to match. To join their mailing list/street team, you can find them on myspace under ""cherry monroe"" and you will be directed to their site. You won't regret listening to them. I'm gonna give them four stars because I just recently got attached to them, and joined their street team but I want them to impress me and take it up a notch as well."
3,Candy for the ears...,"There is a sweetness to all the music on this disc, though of the Sweet N Low variety. All the compositions follow the free for all rhapsody style of writing. All composed during the 20th century, but the romantic evidence of Lizst and Dvorak abound.This time we get continous folk melodies from Belgium. The authors are either pure blood Belgian by birth or settled there from elsewhere. The problem is they all sound alike! Pretty themes are splashed everywhere, little extended development on any one theme is heard. All six rhapsodies could have been written by any of the six obscure composers and you would not know the difference. Only Albert Roussel(French heritage)stands out for his ballet ""Le Peri"" and even his music blends in seamlessly with the others. All and all Cond. Rahbari and the BRTN Philarmonic(Brussels)make the most of it with whimsical playing and fine recorded sound from the engineers."
3,Southerner and Confederate not the same thing,"This work is a survey of disloyalty and outright treason among confederate troops and civilians during the civil war.First published in 1934 as a an expanded doctoral thesis, this work was seminal in civil war historiography for knocking down one of the legs of the ""Lost Cause"" that the south was united in it's desire to fight the north. It's well known that border states like Tennessee and Virginia were divided over secession, but this work makes clear that even deep south states such as Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama had significant movements dedicated to undermining confederate war efforts.The work does not go into analysis, and questions about the impact of the anti war movements, or a comparison of such movements between the north and the south are not answered.Worth three stars for the portrait of life in the rural south during the war."
5,Historical and Delightful and Beyond Price,"If you have any claim to love of poetry please have a glance at this book. Reading Clare, when he's got it on, is like walking through the countryside of a land that no longer exists...but can still, in 2003, through many of these poems, be seen. I opened this book thinking to read for ten minutes or so but could not put it down..."
1,Don't buy this book,"John Clare is a fantastic poet, but this is a corrupt edition of his poems. The editor, one Jonathan Bate, has gone through and punctuated Clare's poems, despite Clare's explicit wishes that his poems be left as he wrote them (virtually without punctuation). If editors were still ""tidying up"" Emily Dickinson's equally idiodyncratic punctuation, we'd have their heads, but somehow this editor has gotten away with bowdlerizing Clare. If you want a bigger slection with more accurate texts, check out The Oxford Authors: John Clare, David Powell and Eric Robinson, eds., ISBN 0192813951."
5,Perfect hubby gift,My hubby lost his old bag and I thought his world had ended!!! I found this one and ordered it and I became the best wife in the world.....AGAIN! Great quality bag and if it made my picky hubby happy it will make you happy too!! Hahaha!
4,Nice.. just slower to ship,Slow to ship but other wise nice item.. the price was good and the leather is nice as this is new i can't say how it holds up..
5,Excellent!!,"This was a Christmas gift for my son and I stocked it full of his favorite grooming supplies. It has ample space and the zippered bottom pocket is ideal for things you need frequently like toothbrushes, combs, dental floss.. making them easy to reach. The leather is very good quality."
4,Great bag,"This is a high quality bag with lots of space. A bit bigger than I expected, so it's better for long trips rather than weekend getaways. Had a weird smell for awhile and the black tended to rub off on my fingers at first, but now that it's aired out and broken in, everything is fine. I really like the medical style opening action."
4,A good book,"This was a good book that made you want to read to the end, but it wasn't a book that blew me away. Its your basic love story twisted with the future. The author has some really interesting ideas, and his views are entertaining. Read it."
5,Circuit of Heaven,"I am an avid reader, but usually not of science fiction. Dennis Danvers has fully caught my attention. The story line of this book was one that I lost myself in from beginning to end and I am looking forward to reading End of Days and anything else the author has written."
2,Romeo and Juliet in a bad SciFi setting,"If you think you could still enjoy Romeo and Juliet, this story might be for you. If that play makes you think ""Stupid kids"", you should skip this book.The setting of this story is weak. Almost everyone has voluntarily given up life in the real world to live in a virtual world. The technology is not plausibly described and it seems even less likely that so many people would actually enter the world.So much for the setting. The rest of the story is a love story. It may be based on Romeo and Juliet. I can't really spoil the ending, since I didn't get that far. I got to the point where I realized it was possible that the lovers were being set up to die in a tragic fashion, and I didn't really care if they did."
3,Sticks with you; a good scifi read,"Love, religion and technology dominate Dennis Danvers' ""realistic"" (pardon the pun) view of what might occur in our not-too-distant future (one could draw a parallel between the Internet and the Bin). Danver's story echoes ""The Light of Other Days"" by Stephen Baxter and Arthur C. Clarke and ""Spin"" by Robert Charles Wilson, with overtones of Harry Harrison's ""Make Room! Make Room!"" Fans of the singer Aimee Mann, rejoice: she finds her way in here as well. A worthwhile read, secondarily thoughtful and an addition to be had for your collection."
4,Will AI take us to heaven?,"This book reminded me of the Frank Tipler book ""Physics of immortality"". In these books the ability to ""capture"" human experience and run those captured ""programs"" on a machine of some sort is the path to heaven (in the Danvers book), and to God in the Tippler book. A fun engaging read."
4,worth skimming through a few pages,All this Matrix-like mumbo jumbo! might get you sick after a while... Although I dig it :)
4,fifth angel,"I recently purchase this album and to my surprise it was good. They remind me of early queeensryche with a hint of dio and black sabbath in some of there songs.The standouts are only the strong survive ,shout it out loud , fallout ,and fifth angel.There sonwritting has reliougs theme to them ,the guitar playing is fanstatic.Buy this cd iam sure you wont be dissapointed.I hope this review was helpfull to you"
2,A step-down from the Finder's Stone trilogy,"In Azure Bonds, there was real mystery: what were Alias' origins, and who was Dragonbait? In Song of the Saurials, the intrigue continued with the mysterious Grypht, and the action was built to an epic scale, with the companions fighting gods and dragons. But everything is scaled down in Masquerades. Alias (who does not seem nearly as well developed as in past books) and the gang are confined to a singular, typical city (so it's not too epic), facing a typical, predictable villain (so it's not too mysterious). This book could have been converted into a cheesy Dungeons and Dragons adventure pretty easily, and that's not a good thing. If Novak and Grubb want to return to these characters, how about they do it through another well-thought out, interesting, mysterious trilogy? I just don't think they expended the same effort on this ""little Harpers book"" as they have in past efforts."
4,Wow! Originality? I thought it dead >:),"I think the villain in this book is one of the most original, and truly realist. I was so drawn into this story, I practically read the whole novel in one night! It's unpredictable and addictive. My only gripe, a truly minor one, is that last part in the other plane. W/o spoiling anything, let's say that ""letting go of bitterness and despair, and thinking about love blah blah blah"" somewhat annoyed me. I think all authors should drop this cliché ^_^. Aside from that, it's sheer perfection."
5,Deeper understanding of myself and my sons,"My wife left this book on my desk for me to read. It was more informative and helpful than I could have imagined and educated me on how to be a better father, not only in caring for my three sons but also for myself.I was especially drawn to the emotional development of boys that gave me a deeper understanding of what my sons are going through as they develop into young men. Now I feel more confident in my parenting decisions."
5,An informative guide,"From Boys to Men is well written and very informative. Any criticism that the book denegrates women by ""reducing"" them to a caretaker role is preposterous. In fact, by providing a useful and accessible guide to the basics of men's health, Dr. Senay has made a valuable contribution to women, men and their families. I highly recommend the book."
1,Reducing women to role of caretaker!,"I am stunned that this book has even been written. Why is this text not addressed to men? There are many women, I would say most, that take much better care of their husbands and sons than they do of themselves. Where is the partner book on teaching men to take better care of women and to become better care takers in general. It is at that point that they will learn self-care."
2,"cheap, and you get what you pay for","i bought this because i didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for a plug,but, i got what i paid for.won't stay in place without a clip.seems to be very brittle plastic, not soft at all, so i feat that if anything bumps into it,in the cold weather, it will just likely shatter.would recommend a different product."
4,Great effort even if it a little pricy,This is more of a short story then an actual novel surprising since one of the main guys is GRRM man of 1000 pages. Its not going to win any awards but it is a decent enough story with more then a few interesting characters. Best of all it reads like a continuous story written in one shot not like one slowly written by 3 authors over the course of almost 30 years.
5,Not for everyone- but it works GREAT for me....,"I came across this product while researching cloth/washable pads. At first, the idea didn't appeal to me at all, but after reading the reviews, I decided it was worth a shot. So, after some practice and a few mishaps- I can say I LOVE IT! The ultimate test was when I went rock climbing with it in and experienced no leaks and couldn't even tell it was in!Now, if you are considering this product for yourself- please know- it takes some practice! The first few times of inserting it and emptying it was messy and a bit confusing. But with some practice, I can now empty and reinsert quickly and with no mess at all.Also, as other reviews have mentioned, if you can't use tampons, this probably won't work for you. It's not for everyone, but it did work for me and I am now a true believer! Good bye tampons!!!"
2,Cannot use if you have an IUD!,"I read a bunch of reviews and product specifications, then the first thing I saw on the box when I got it was ""Do not use if you have an IUD."" So I guess I'm stuck with the old methods."
5,Won't use anything else,A year ago I saw this in a store and figured I'd try it. Now I won't use anything else. No more mess. No more worries. Sleep naked and the husband does not even know it is that time.
3,Consider your sizing! Wanted to love but didn't :(,"I love the idea of this product. If this particular one had worked for me I would have given it 5 stars. It just didn't fit me personally.I'm 38. I've never had kids. I went by the sizing that Diva recommends and I think that was my mistake. The size 2 was way too big for me. I had a lot of trouble getting it in and out, and forget about being able to rotate it to get it to seat correctly. I had to do so much fiddling around that it was painful. Not a fun place to be painful!I did a little research online, and found a Youtube video where someone showed and demonstrated several of the different brands and sizes. I settled on the Lunette size 1. It's so much better.I didn't have a problem with this brand really, and I love the idea and how it works. I would just caution anyone who is over 30 and has never had children to think hard about what size they might need."
5,Love this product,"I am here because I am buying my second diva cup. I have used it for 4 years, without any problems, but it's time to replace it. I have recommend these to so many of my friends and they also love this product. I love not having to pain for tampons every month. I love that I don't have to change it as often, and I love that it's easy to use (once you get use to it)."
3,It's alright,I LOVE the concept. My one and only complaint; I wish this came with a longer stem for those who need it and those who don't can trim it. It goes to the age old adage that you can take more off but can't add more to it.
5,love it!!!!,No more leakage!!!! This cup is great and surprisingly easy to use and quite comfortable. A must have!!AllieGA
2,Too long!,"I was so excited to try this product, but am completely dissatisfied with it. I have tried it over and over again, but it is so uncomfortable. Even after trimming the stem completely off, I can feel the bottom of the cup ready to protrude. If it's pushed in any further, it doesn't create a good seal and leaks or doesn't open at all. After doing more research, I have learned that the Diva Cup is the longest of all the mentrual cups; I wish I had bought one of the shorter versions. At this point, however, I'm hesitant to invest in another brand. Part of the reason I did this was to save money. What a huge waste of money! I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I like the concept, but that's as far as it goes."
4,Good product,"It will end up saving me a lot of money and environmental waist. It has been popular in European countries for yrs now. I have to admit it is awkward, but it gets easier to use. It takes some practice and patience, it was a little painful for me at first but now I have learned some better ways to use it. I have used it for two cycles now, seems like maybe my cramps are better too, maybe just a coincidence. I hope it catches on in the sates."
2,Doesn't work for me at all,"I bought this because I love the Softcup disposables but wanted something reuseable. The fit is not the same at all. I can not feel the Softcups, and they NEVER come out before I take them out. The Divacup literally falls out. I am inserting it past the pubic bone and turning it to make sure it is open. It stays for about 10 minutes and then is hanging out of my body. I have trimmed the stem, and have even tried using it inside out, as some have suggested. Great product for some, but does not work for me and isn't returnable."
3,Research First,"You should research menstrual cups, as they differ greatly in size. Diva makes the longest by far. There are lots of different shape and size combos. Also, they recommend a large if you are over 25 yrs old, despite previous childbirth. This can make the difference with leaks! [...]"
2,Not satisfied,After reading the reviews I bought this thinking it would be great. I have had a hard time getting it to fit just right without leaking. I will keep trying.
2,Couldn't get it back out,It was super difficult to get this baby in there and once it was there it wouldn't come back out (at least not easily) so I've been weary of trying it again. Needless to say I found this product to be a gigantic waste of money.
4,"Great first time cup, huge learning curve","Let me start by saying I have used this cup through 2 cycles and will continue using it. There is a huge learning curve and I am still wearing some form of back up, but any leaking has been minor. I finally just bought some reusable pantyliners and that is plenty for backup even though I have very heavy cycles. This is not for those uncomfortable with their bodies, but I am thrilled I took the plunge and invested in one. I have already seen the savings!"
3,will take some time,"This product will take some time to get use to, and time to learn to insert. I read some where that it will take three cycles to get use to. We will have to see. It's a good idea though."
5,I'm a Diva!,I wasn't sure I'd like it but thought it was worth a try. I've used it for one cycle and love it. My periods are very heavy and I would wake up 2-4 times a night just to change my pad or tampon. With the Diva Cup I got up only once the first night and slept through the rest of the nights. I can't feel it at all when it's in and find it's easy to insert and remove. I would recommend the Diva Cup to anyone!
5,Diva cup where have you been all my life?!?,The diva cup really works! Note there is a learning curve but once it is in right you are good to go for hours. The first few days of my cycle are heavy so I empty the cup about ever 4 hours or so. The last few days I am able to go the whole 12 hours! No worry about toxic shock! No stinky bloody products in my bathroom trash smelling up the place!Diva cup makes having your period much less of a hassle. I recommend that every woman get this. If you are squeamish about getting your own fluids on your hands you should work on getting over it and get this anyway. lol
5,great product,"Not great for the first day when flow is heavy, but great for lighter days. I guess it will be worth it in the long run. After a couple of months, I have it down, and changed my mind, its awesome."
4,wish i knew sooner...,"Being a gyno-cancer survivor, id been forced to take a second look at my feminine product ingredients. I didnt know tampons contained chemicals like bleach in them. I was pleasantly surprised to find a whole assortment of eco,chemical free, comfortable alternatives. i dont remember why i chose the diva, but i do remember thinking how lite and soft it was after i took it out the pack. When i first had a chance to try it on...whalla! fit like a charm without any discomfort or irritation. Insert and out does take a lil practice, but i intend to get some years worth out of this product. hope this helps with your decision."
4,diva cup,Works great. Some leakiness if not inserted perfectly. I used panty liner as back-up. But it is still a great item. Shipping was fast. Overall I would recommend this product.
2,Doesn't Defy Gravity,"Well I'd read so many great reviews so I decided to go green. It was not very difficult to insert the first time, but for me it got harder each time and messy. I wore it the first day with no leaks or issues which was great. But then when I slept with it, I couldn't help waking up thinking, how is this thing going to defy gravity and not spill out. Lo and behold, the next morning, SMH, you know the rest. Good thing I use back up at all times or it would have been a huge disaster. I'll just stick with what's always worked for me."
2,Everything you never wanted to know....,"If your uterus is ""tipped""--like mine!!--you may be wasting your money. It really has to be worn like a cervical cap, even though the instructions say it's not one. If you jog or run, it slides down, and I had to readjust it every 2 hours. And I don't have any ""pelvic floor"" issues, either!It took a week to figure out how to use it--my bladder feels pinched when I'm wearing it (I know, I know--how does a bladder feel pinched?) But the feeling never goes away.And then, it still sometimes leaks, because I can't get the seal right, no matter which way I insert it.If you're an eco-friendly gal, go for the lotus pads or the luna pads--both are good,reusable cotton pads. And try the organic tampons--unless your anatomy is perfect, the diva cup is not a good product."
3,Great Alternative,I had been reviewing this product for awhile before taking the plunge to purchase. I was already using the disposable product (Instead) which I love..love..love. The Diva Cup is a great product as well. As others have stated the DC took practice inserting and removing but still wasn't comfortable to me. It was easy to insert using the method from the instructions but I had a really hard time removing it. It totally made me nervous to the point of having to stop and take a little break to relax a couple times. It also doesn't hold as much as Instead. If you can maneuver the removal and don't have a heavy flow then this is the product for you. I will stick with the Instead which is larger and easier to remove.
4,Great except for swimming,"It works great, even on heavy days. Unfortunately, when I use it while swimming, the cup get water in it & it then overflows. Once I've dried off, when I change positions I had a trickle that felt like I wet myself. But it was really just the cup/water issue. Otherwise I love it."
3,"Eh, less impressed","I like this product to a point. I does hold well, with good protection. It is though a real pain to get positioned right to get a seal and sometimes very hard to get out. This can be a messy situation. The pull thing on bottom could really be longer or better to grip maybe. Other than that, it's relatively comfortable... useful when you want to work for it."
4,Warning! Learning curve required,"For the first period you use this product, insert and remove in the shower!!! Trust me, until you get the hang of how you will need to adjust it you will be glad you took this advice. Also, wear a panty liner until you are used to the correct fit of the cup and at night on heavy nights.Once you know how to insert the cup correctly to preven leakage, you will not need to do this. But it will make the learning curve much easier."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I have had my DivaCup for almost year now and haven't replaced it yet. I fell in love with this thing. I always had a hard time with tampons and pads were always so bulky and uncomfortable, not to mention inconvenient (ever do yoga wearing a pad?). The DivaCup? I often forget that it's even there. Literally. It is so comfortable to me that I have to remind myself that I'm even on my period. I love that I never have to worry about buying more pads or running to the store. Super easy. I sometimes will wear a very thin pad the first day of my period just in case I forget to change the cup because it's just that comfortable.I keep some tissues in my bag to clean it out in a public restroom, but even with some toilet paper it is clean again. Their special wash helps for keeping it clean at home. The DivaCup has also paid for itself and then some. I can't get over how much I love this thing!"
3,Too BIG? Try a different brand.,"I bought this size, per Diva's recommendations (over 30, post-childbirth), and it is WAY too long (pinches and protrudes out), and too wide (causes cramps). Turning it inside out makes it usable, but I'm still aware that it's there, and after a long day it starts to get uncomfortable. Although, I like the idea of a menstrual cup for many reasons, this one wasn't for me because of the size. So, don't rule out a menstrual cup if this one doesn't work for you. I'm currently ordering a Lunette, size 1, and I have higher hopes for that one."
5,Best thing ever!,"As far as I am concerned, the menstrual cup is the only way to go. It has completely changed my life. My period is no longer a big deal. The Diva cup keeps you clean and comfortable and free. I completely forget it is even there. You can wear it for up to 12 hours with no problems whatsoever. It is much more sanitary than a pad and much safer/more comfortable/longer lasting/cleaner than a tampon. It is not associated with toxic shock syndrome which is a huge plus. It has saved me so much money and hassle over the years because it is reusable. When I go on vacation I don't have to pack a suitcase full of disposable stuff. I just throw in my Diva cup. It takes some practice inserting, but once you've got that down you are good to go. You can also boil it to make sure it is all clean at the end of each cycle. Do yourself a favor and start using it now. I only wish I had known about it sooner. I recommend it to everyone."
5,This is going to save me a TON of money!,"After watching some tutorials on youtube I expected there to be a ""curve"" in learning to use the Diva Cup. I wanted to shout with joy at how easy it was to use! It was no harder to use than a non-applicator tampon (like OB), and it was much less messy than other reusable feminine products (like Instead). I will be using the Diva Cup until the blessed day that I'm old enough to not need it."
5,Great Product,"The product is great, however, What would have helped is better instructions on insertion and removal. I'm still learning but am very happy with my switch."
2,seemed like a good option,"This product seems like a good option for those of us who are tired of the constant leaking/changing of tampons or wearing pads however i could not get the cup to suction. Therefore, it wouldn't stay in place and became uncomfortable after an hour of wearing it. i tried multiple times to get it work but i just couldn't so i gave up for that cycle and maybe i will give it a shot next cycle. It is large but if you fold it and wet the rim it's goes in pretty easily. I followed all the directions about turning it 360 degrees and pushed it as far in as i could but i still just could not get this thing to work. Of course then i think there's something wrong w/ me b/c i couldn't get it to work. So if your up for a challenge and really looking to try something new maybe give the cup a shot. I'm still up in the air about it but hopefully i can get it to work."
3,Not as advertised,"I ordered this as a replacement. While it is a great product and I highly recommend it, I was rather disappointed with the company. They advertised this as ""Diva Cup Model 2 DivaCup Menstrual Solution AND DivaWash"". It did not come with the wash. Had I known that I would have ordered from a different company/website that had this item listed for a lower price. I rate this with 5 stars for the product, and 3 for the company and their false advertising."
3,"Good product, but not the only one you'll ever need","The menstrual cup definitely takes a bit of getting used to, and I can't recommend using it in a public bathroom. I found that it works great for light to medium flow, but is far more trouble (& mess!) than it's worth during heavy flow.Unfortunately it doesn't replace pads & tampons completely, but it's nice to have another option & well worth the purchase price."
5,amazing,"i bought this thinking it cant be true, but darnnit i was wrong, it is very easy to use, keeps you cleaner than a pad or tampon, and leaves no odor. i can use this and not have to worry about running out of pads or tampons while im out or at work, the only thing is when i sleep i have to wear a pantyliner the first night because thats when my period is heaviest. but overall this thing is great, i can actually for get that my period is on, not wads of cotton between my legs, or crazy strings. i would and have recommened this alredy"
5,Life changing!,So easy to use!! Cant feel it! I love it! Wish I wouldve found this product sooner! So happy!!! :)
4,so far so good...,I think I will really like the divacup once I truly get the hang of using it. But even with the initial awkwardness its still better than the alternatives.
5,AMAZING,"I love the Diva Cup! Like many, at first I thought this sounded crazy messy. But it's actually SO much cleaner and easier. I love that I only have to change it out twice a day. I have a super fast paced job and I love that I don't have to think about it so worry about carrying around tampons/pads.Plus? I like that I don't have to buy tampons. I always seemed to need them when I didn't have them.Diva is super comfortable and convenient."
3,DivaCup Model 2 Post-Childbirth,This cycle is my first time using the DivaCup. It may take me another cycle or two to feel confident enough to leave the house without backup. I have trouble (I followed the directions exactly) keeping it in place and it's mostly 'hit and miss' still. I feel like with more practice that problem will be solved. I find that wearing it inside out seems to be the most comfortable.
4,Much cleaner alternative...and cheaper!,"I never knew something like this existed. Much cleaner than pads and tampons. I never have to worry about leaking or taking enough tampons with me when I go somewhere. I'm saving so much money, too. It's pretty easy to put in and take out. I cut the stem as it stuck out and made it feel awkward. My son was a big baby and so I think that's why after walking with the cup in it starts to slip down. It won't slip out, but the bottom of it pokes out a bit and it's awkward feeling. But tampons felt awkward at first, too. Even so, I find it much healthier to wear than tampons and more fresh than pads."
5,Serioulsy - where the hell has this cup been all my life?!!,I cannot say enough good things about this product! It is really simple to insert/remove and once its in you really cannot feel it at all. I had it in for the full 12 hours on a normal flow day and not one leak. No uncomfortable full tampon feeling either which is a really nice bonus. I am usually changing tampons at least every 2-3 hours on this day of my cycle and still having leakage issues. I'm not even bothering to use a backup with this cup. When it came time to change it there was no mess involved. It is not at messy or gross like I feared it might be. If you're on the fence just go ahead and buy it. You will not be disappointed!
5,Great product!,I have been using it for years. Great product and will continue to use for years to come.
5,Love it!,"I wish I knew about this way earlier in life! I did have the model 1 but since I recently had my first child I bought this one. So easy, much more comfortable than tampons, and holds more too. It takes a few times to get the hang of using, but now I wouldn't use anything else!"
4,Works great!!,"Found this at a really good price here. It worked well and did exactly as expected. Only exception was that it prevents me from emptying my bladder, so using the bathroom requires extra effort. In addition the merchant was affected by hurricane Sandy, and should have made the item unavailable during this time but didn't, so shipping was delayed several days, at least 6-7. Please take any bladder, or urinary issues into consideration with this cup and any other. It inserted and sealed well. I initially thought it would be too big. I do however think I could have used a size 1. So if you know your body, follow you instinct on which size to try, just beware its none refundable."
5,can't believe I wasted money on tampons all these years!,"I was curious about these so decided to take the plunge, can't believe how easy it is to use...only took one day to get it all figured out. (Also ordered some reusable pantiliners off etsy.com to have on hand...although I haven't had any leaking with the diva.....I think I would still like the reassurance incase it ever got full.) If you are even considering these, it is worth it to try it....for the price it pays for itself very quickly. I originally bought it to use part time and tampons the other part...but now that I have tried it I will NEVER buy tampons again.....seriously, why isn't the word out on these things! MONEY SAVER! HELLO"
4,Impressed,Takes some getting used to but once you figure it out it is way better than any other feminin product out there. Read the instructions! I can't rate it 5 star because I can't say I love it simply because of what it is. Who loves anything to do with their period. I would totally recommend this....and it is made in Canada!
5,Love this!,"Works great! Glad I purchased. Easy to use, soo much easier than tampons!! So glad I purchased this. Also use lunapads."
5,Every Girl Needs One!!!!!,"I love my Diva Cup!!! I don't know how I ever lived without it! It was a little tricky the first time I used it. I put it in the morning that I'm getting my period and then I don't have to worry about leaks. I just empty it twice a day, makes life so easy! Plus I love going to the store and walking by all the products knowing I don't have to spend all that money any more!"
2,Ugh. Stay away from this product.,"This product does everything it promises except for come out. It is easy to get in. It doesn't leak. You can't feel it once it is in. But when it is time to come out....forget it. Even with a good seal it rides up too high. The stem is not at all helpful to get it out because it is too short and not really something you can grab on to.It took an hour to get it out, and you couldn't pay me to try it again and risk going through the heroics and effort it took to get that thing out.I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1 because it did deliver in every area except for being able to get it out. If everyone's first try is like this and there is just a learning curve to getting it out, then the company needs to put a warning to that effect on the instructions so the user is prepared. This was a huge dissapointment because it seemed like such a good way to reduce the trash/garbage I create. I really wanted this to work."
3,not comfortable,"I am 30 years old and have had 2 c-sections so from reading the box size 2 was recomended. It was easy to insert but for me was uncomfortable. Maybe my cervix is low. It also hurt removing it. I was not removing it incorrectly either. The rim is just so thick that it hurt while getting the rim just to come out. I didn't have any leakage though and do think this is a great idea. But, for me I think i'll try the size 1 and if that doesn't work well then maybe go for the instead cups."
5,Try this!,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. It is easy to use, you can not feel it, there is no mess, and best of all I will never have to buy pads or tampons again. It saves me money. It is reusable, better for the environment. You can sleep, swim, and shower with it in. It is water proof. I wish I had learned about this years ago."
5,Everything they say it is.,"This product is WONDERFUL! If you check out the diva cup website, they have a ton of information and lots of testimonials. There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. All I can do is confirm that everything they say is true. I love this product and my only complaint is that it took me so long to find it."
1,Worked out...at first.,"After getting over the fact I was directed to get a large size cup because I'm over 30, I really was quite surprised at how amazingly this worked out. I was one of those people who would constantly forget to pack tampons in my purse, having accidents, wearing black underwear for a whole week, etc. My periods are light enough that I could wear this all day long without any changing, and it was so convenient. However, I don't feel quite as much the environmental hero I thought I would be: sometimes it can leak a drop or two. So don't throw away those panty liners.UPDATE 11/14/2010:I had to stop using the cup completely after I started to experience pain with bowel movements. Apparently, the cup was putting pressure on my rectum, and the discomfort began after i had a rather large BM with the cup still in. It was horrible. I still think a person could use these menstrual cups, but I think there should be a warning regarding that."
4,Good... once you get used to it,"This is a wonderful product that can make 'that time of the month' so much easier.I highly recommend it to all women who don't have the time to mess with tampons and leaks.The only problem with it is removal. I had a hard time at first, but once I got the hang of it and how to relax my muscles, it's not too bad at all. It does require a private bathroom where you can use the sink to wash it off before reinserting it, but this is not a problem for most."
5,Don't wait another month -- become a Diva now!,"Save money, eliminate hassle, reduce landfill, and feel great with the Diva cup! No more irritation from chemical-filled pads. No more tampons that don't slide enough or slide too much. In the cost of 1-2 months of these disposable products, you'll pay for your Diva cup and will never look back. It may take a few tries to get it to open properly, but once you do, you'll be leak-free. I've used it swimming, kayaking, and walking. You do need access to running water when it's time to empty, so I won't be taking it backpacking.This holiday season, my closest friends will become Divas too!"
4,Kinda love it?,"It worked great once I got it in (using some lube) but having severe back problems, I never realized I wouldn't be able to get it out. I had to get my husband to get it out the first time. I got it out myself in the shower the second time. we'll see about the 3rd time. At least there was no leaking and no pain from tampons grating against my vaginal walls!"
4,does take a little practice,I will never buy tampons again. Trust yourself. If it doesn't feel like its in right. Its probably not. Don't go to yoga. Just gotta make sure it feels like it has popped back into shape because you have to squish it to get it in. I guess I only gave it four because I still have to deal with my period. Doesn't magically go away. Just got a lot easier!
3,"Fits well, inconvenient for outings","I like spending less money on pads and tampons and the Diva cup has been relatively easy for me to insert and remove now that I've used it a few times, but sheesh--it is NOT convenient to change when out. At home I'm not too worried about it, but in a public or shared restroom it's pretty gross to have to bring it out and rinse it off in the sink (more for other people than for me, but that's pretty embarrassing, too). Much better for use at home!"
1,Womp Womp Womp,"I read some of the reviews and i wanted to try this product, but after trying it I am disappointed. Im 26 years and I have a child, so I ordered model 2. im not sure if its too big but once I put it in it was the most uncomfortable feeling ever! i tried putting it in 4 different ways and each way was so uncomfortable.It barely stayed in. i kept pushing it up, but it kept coming down. im not sure if model 1 will work better, but Im pretty pissed that I just wasted $30 on something i'll have to throw out."
5,Great product,"I got this before going to Africa for a couple of years. I started using it in the US and absolutely loved it. I wished that I had known about it sooner. As much as I loved it here, I found it more difficult to use in Africa. You're supposed to rinse it with potable water. It was too inconvenient in my situation. I'll definitely get another in the US though."
2,"Worked, but hurt.","The diva cup worked for me in the most basic way, but i couldnt deal with the constant sensation of fullness, inability to completely empty bladder, cramping from the suction. Even after trimming the stem to nothing, a bit of it would still poke out of me when i bent over or sat or scrunched at the waist for whatever reason. The silicone was too firm, the rim too large. i looked up other brands and Diva is by far one of the largest. I recently purchased a LadyCup and the difference has been amazing.31, no kidsDivaCup 2 - FAILLadyCup (L)- WINS"
5,using the diva cup,"Hi, for those who are looking to use this product, I had used now twice and I love it. If you care about your environment please do it no regret. You will need a little bit of practice to be able to use right but by the second time around you just do it naturally."
5,Love it.,"I would never go back to anything else. I've found what I like, and I'm sticking to it. Diva cup is so easy and econmical, I bought mine a couple of years ago, and it's still going strong!"
5,Great!,Very happy to have bought this for my best friend at her baby shower- she got it very quickly- thank you!
2,"Great idea, but...","The thing is waaaay too big. I am over 30 and have had a child, but I also have a cervix that tends to get in the way. I considered this when buying, but didn't see any information or reviews that would lead me to believe that I should opt for the smaller cup - and I read a lot before I made my purchase. They really should think about suggesting some other considerations in determining the appropriate size. I am not sure that childbirth or age are good determining factors anyway. The vagina is a very elastic organ. Unless you have had a bunch of children, I am fairly certain that most stay just about the same size and shape as pre-childbirth. Particularly when you gave birth quite a long time ago (as I did). There's no way to return/exchange it, obviously. So it was a waste of $[...]."
5,So worth trying,"First read about this in a womans magazine. Had to at least try it. So far, I really like it! So much 'cleaner' than other methods that have been used for years! It is a little different but for those who have heavier cycles, it is so worth trying out. Just read and follow directions closley and it's no problem."
5,Pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it!!,"Word of advice: Do not expect to love this product on your first use!It took me my full cycle to finally get the hang of it. I had to try both folds, the U-fold makes the cup harder to insert and it wouldn't position right once it was in. The other fold made inserting and positioning a breeze! I recommend trying both folds before you decide if a menstrual cup is for you or not. I LOVE that I can wear this product all day without having to empty it, it's very freeing. I'm totally in love with this product, I will be never go back to tampons.UPDATE:I'm still very much so IN LOVE with my Divacup and am no longer a tampon user. I love going all day without having to worry about changing/leaking. I also love the money I've saved and did I mention it's GREEN?!?? LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I still only own (1) cup and don't see the need for 2 cups."
3,Diva Cup purchase...,Good product but only the diva cup was included in the shipment-diva cup wash was not included like the add stated.
2,"Messy, Inconvenient, Not for Working Mom on-the-go","I'm not a fan. Having your monthly cycle is already messy enough. With the DivaCup it's even messier. I could see this working for a stay at home Mom who doesn't have many places to go and also who's cycle is not heavy in flow. I don't fit either of these descriptions. I'm not saying it's a horrible product. But, it's certainly not for everyone, including me. Tampons and pads are much easier and cleaner. I know the cup is better for the environment. But using it made my monthly time more stressful than it is with tampons and pads."
1,Defective product,"I received the Diva Cup and it is DEFECTIVE. It is missing the 4 holes below the rim. The seller has never responded to my inquiries about this. I have also contacted the manuafacturer directly and they want me to return the cup and wait at least 3 weeks for a replacement. I purchased this to leave on an extended vacation and this ""solution"" doesn't help me. I am very disappointed in the lack of response from the seller and don't recommend using them. I have not used the product because of the defect and am unsure of how it will impact its use."
5,Great Read,Suburban Xanadu is a great book that really captures the history of Las Vegas. I took the class that was taught by Professor David Schwartz and it was well worth buying the book. I have had many of my friends and business colleagues read this book and they thought it was great. Suburban Xanadu is must read to truly understand Las Vegas past and how it all got started.
1,A Pedantic Read about Las Vegas,Don't be fooled. This is a purely pedantic and priggish book about Las Vegas. Not worth your time.
5,If Fredo Corleone Headed His Own Family....,"It may very well have turned out like the rollicking racketeers in this novel. Film has elevated the Mafioso to either a Brando-like brilliant elder statesman, calculating and controlled Pacino or overweight but sexy Tony Soprano. Breslin spins all those ideas off the map with a tale about ""regular guys"" who happen to be mobsters and are, in fact, none too successful at it. Graphic and brutal, while maintaining and air of both satire and farce, this story is, with all its laughs, probably closest to the truth. After you worship at the altar of Vito Corleone, meet this other family in a very funny novel in which every mobster has the IQ of Fredo."
5,Funny and insightful as hell,"If you are looking for a solemn documentary on the mafia, go elsewhere. If you want to be entertained by a brilliantly depicted cast of characters, this is for you. Fans of 'The Simpsons' should take a look at this.The more politically correct and squeamish should stay away. This is about gansters; bad people doing bad things. If you can't sit through Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"" then don't even try to read this book.After 15 years of occasionally re-reading this book, it still makes me laugh out loud."
2,Great idea but....,"Yet again it seems Monte Cook has no idea what power levels he is writing his modules for. This is the second one I purchased written by him and it claims to be designed for 9th level characters. Well I and my fellow players didnt think so. Well maybe if you consider loosing half the party without any real ability to respond to be a good challenge then this might be for you. On the third attempt at the meat of the module we finally stumled across a ""loop-hole"" that would allow us to claim victory. The story premise is good however."
2,Remington Shaver foils,"These are bulk foils and cutters. Poorly repacked. No way to know if these are, as advertised, Remington razor products or cheap copies. I expected to find them in Remington, safe, bubble packs. They were inserted into cardboard packages with the Remington number penciled outside on the box."
1,Mismatch when using standard blades,"This screen just just slightly smaller then the standard screen, because of this, while it fits on the razor itself (the MS2 100 anyway) it creates to much friction with the standard blades and it doesnt' cut properly."
5,Remington Replacement Heads A-OK!,"Get 'em, Got 'em, Good! They are a bit difficult to install but once in the groove, they work great!"
3,Honest review,"These blades are a knock off, don't expect the same results as a Remington product. The holes the hair goes through is not as big as the Remington screens and it seems to be made out of a different type of metal. I replaced only one screen and compared the original with this knock off. If i angled right i could use either one and compare the results. The knock off worked but wasn't as close of a shave and took a little longer to get all the hairs. Every once and awhile it would yank a hair or two while shaving, not a big deal if you go slow but very annoying. I wouldnt recommend unless your strapped for cash"
4,"no almond, but excellant flavor","These are excellant in flavor, but the packaging implys it contains almonds which it does not....it contains almond flavor"
4,Do you love coconut?,"If so, you probably will love these bars. The almond flavor is a nice enhancer, but like other reviewers, I wish there were actual almonds. In that case, I would have rated these 5 stars. These bars satisfy my yearning for a Mounds or Almond Joy. Every couple of years I give in, but then I feel guilty about it. Now I can have my sweet coconut fix whenever I feel like it. If I really want to indulge, I have a piece of dark chocolate along with the bar. Good stuff! I will definitely order more when my current box is empty."
2,chewy,very disappointed that there were no nuts and only an almond flavor that wasnt very almondy! if you like coconut and only coconut it would be good but it is a chewy bar so if your teeth arent strong i would also pass in buying this bar!
3,too much fat,The taste isn't bad. I am troubled that the website didn't list any nutritional information. There is WAY too much fat in these.
1,Didn't care for them,"My husband, who is celiac, did not care for them at all. He said they didn't have much taste. Would not recommend them."
1,"False Advertisement, where is the ""Almond"" ?","Label says ""Oskri Organics Coconut Bar with Almonds, 1.9-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)""....you will notice once you receive them that there are in fact NO Almonds....its a flavor....lolIt should have read ""Oskri Organics Coconut Bar with Almond flavor""...so much for Oskri"
3,"Great taste, but needs different ingredients","This coconut bar was ALL coconut...I thought there might be something else in it - like some oats or flax or something. But it's just coconut and even though I really like coconut, it's a bit much. I can't eat a whole bar, and my kids take about three bites and say it's ""too sweet"". Would prefer more ingredients in them."
1,Feeling let down,"A number of years ago I thoroughly enjoyed Nancy Brown's book on Advertising Photography and so I ordered her book on Nude Photography sight unseen. I was very disappointed. This book gives very few details on what is a very complicated subject and also manages to give too much information on some very obvious points. I was also disappointed with the photographs. A lot of them were the same in pose and lighting and, although I do understand that the author is doing a series of non-nude photographs with capes, those photos do not belong in this book. The lighting diagrams give very little information and the size of those diagrams and the size of the some of the print take up an inordinate amount of the pages. This book is a very quick read with little information. Had this been an article in a photography magazine I would not be complaining so loudly. For the price of this book however, I feel that the author has let us down."
3,A Good Start,"I first noticed this book at a photo store. After a few minutes browsing I thought it looked interesting. However after buying it I found there was little more to it than what I had picked up in a quick browse. There are some interesting perspectives on working with models. There are also a few technical hints, and some advice on breaking in the business. But I thought none of the topics was covered in sufficient depth to be useful. It's a good start to a book that needs to either focus topics or expand greatly to be useful."
2,selling soap,You wont find any great secrets to photographing the nude in this book. The author seems more concerned on ways of covering the nude than photographing it. Photographic examples are glib and fomulatic looking. Photographs are composed and lighted for soap and skin care product ads that would be aimed at the female consummer and won't offend granma.
1,Don't bother,"This book is a complete waste of time and money for anyone looking for information or images on glamour photography. Very little substance of use. I own approximately 15 books in the area of glamour photography and have read and studied them all. I use them to develop my technical abiliy and creative vision. The 3 best buys I've found for content are ""Successful Glamour Photography"" by John Kelly, ""Part-Time Glamour Photography Full-Time Income"" by Joe Farace and ""Lighting For Glamour Photography"" by David Kimber. These 3 books cover most aspects of glamour photography from the technical to finding models and selling your photographs. Hope this helps those of you looking for more detailed information on the subject of glamour photography."
4,GOOD BUT WEIRD,This movie was good with great acting. I just thought it a bit weird and didn't really make a connection to what it was really all about in the end.
4,surprising,"I didn't think too much of this movie when I popped in the DVD player ""special guest appearance by so and so"" is never a good sign. Anyway, it was really good and Sam Elliot played a pretty good size role too. The movie dealt with some pretty heavy emotional issues and did a good job at it. I felt that the messages of the film were good and positive. There was also not a bunch of unnecessary language or sexuality (although I would not reccomend for children due to the subject matters) Definitely worth watching."
3,personal opinions,"Its been quite awhile since ive seen this movie but as i recall it was a well thought out film with an exceptioal plot....i especially liked the actor neal mcdonough ...hes gorgeous, hes beautiful(great actor, and great bod)"
4,Well Done,"I was quite surprised I liked this... I'm not normally a big fan of Wendy Lawson's books... you know they're just not my cup of tea, but this was actually very good.This would be brilliant book for a teen or young person with AS who has questions about what makes friendships tick. I know this was something I had to learn the hard way and I still struggle with this subject a great deal! Wendy's insights were logical, relevent and helpful and I think just about anybody would find this an interesting read, AS or not.My favourite thing about this book was its positivity and constructive outlook. It asks the important questions and it gives thorough and sensible answers. Buy it, read it, share it."
1,Not for the light-hearted,"I was required to use this text for my graduate courses in Quantum Mechanics. It is by far the worst text on the subject I have ever had the misfortune of using. Hecht's presentation of subject matter is disorganized and often incoherent. His ability to explain with any amount of clarity even the most elementary principles is lacking at best, and his command of the English language is absolutely appalling for someone of his education. The author claims that this book is ""self-contained and can be used by students without a previous course in quantum mechanics."" Don't believe it! This text may be useful for someone who has already taken a few grauate courses in quantum mechanics, but is utterly useless for learning purposes. Hecht should be ashamed of himself for writing such a waste of paper, and I will slap the man if I ever meet him."
3,Raw Dog Food,This book is a great starting point for the pet owner who is considering switching to raw. Our 4 cocker spaniels are currently on this diet now. Don't expect any resource to give you a standard recipe. You need to invest the time and research a recipe you and your dogs can live with. This is NOT an exact science but are happy with the results just the same.
5,Feeding Raw to your dog,"If you are looking for a concise ""how to"" book about feeding raw, this is it!Simple and to the point."
5,"Great book, Perfect for Beginners",I had just started feeding raw and wanted something in my hands to help. This book was super easy to read and understand. It's the perfect book for beginners in the world of raw feeding.It's also a handy reference to keep when you need specific info.Highly recommended.
4,Well written book,"The book does a pretty good job of simplifying the feeding of raw foods to your dog - I've fed raw before so it was a nice review. It is not a detailed and technical as some books, so I would recommend including other books for information also. But a good book - I would recommend it."
5,Very useful and easy to follow!,"I am totally new to raw-feeding and this book really helped me to get into a groove with BARF within the first week. I'm making my glop and feeding a variety of raw meaty bones to my two little poodles. Some of the resource links to internet websites listed in the back of the book are gone, as I've tried to look them up. But this is to be expected as websites change all the time. Would recommend this book to anyone starting out raw feeding."
2,Basic,I really didn't get much from this book. I suggest reading a book by Dr. Ian Billinghurst if you really want to understand RAW feeding.
1,BARF Diet Not Ideal,A strictly raw meaty bone diet is a major step up from BARF...veggies and fruit in small quantities are neither harmful nor necessary. Dogs are not omnivores.
1,Pure bunk.,"This idea is the epitome of sophomoric. Raw food diets are NOT appropriate for domestic dogs, and are HARMFUL at best. Proponents make all kinds of wild claims just short of their dogs being able to run faster than a locomotive, catch bullets, and leap tall buildings with a single bound, but the fact is that there is NO SCIENCE to support these claims. Most problems with domestic dogs are due to the fact that these dogs have been inbred for many, many generations to produce the breeds. Dogs have been evolving alongside humans for more than 30,000 years eating our cooked scraps. Dogs are carnivores, but not fastidious, and are capable of thriving on almost any diet. Raw food is no more appropriate nor ""natural"" for dogs than it is for us. These types of diets are also a public health risk, as they have been shown to transmit pathogenic bacteria and parasites. Few veterinarians recommend this, and for good reason, the ones that do can't back it up with science."
5,A good start,"I liked this book because it provided more of the logistical aspects to raw feeding. It includes how to get started, how to shop for foods, how to store foods, etc. It definitely a good book if you've decided to feed raw. If you're not yet convinced to feed raw yet and want to read more about the science behind it, try Natural Nutrition for Dogs and Cats by Kymythy Schultze. I think it's a more comprehensive guide on why to feed raw, where as this one is more focused on how to feed raw."
3,Not the Best,This is merely an OK book on raw feeding of dogs. I was looking for more detail. She adds a lot of fluff for what little she says. But it is a good place to start.
4,Good general information,This book is encouraging to those of us hesitant to launch into feeding raw. I would like a few more specific instructions
2,it was just OK,"I knew a bit about raw diets already and I felt like this book didn't bring much more to me, especially since I have a miniature dog and she has large dogs. Even the food qualities and kinds of foods aren't a good fit for me. It was easy to read though."
2,Am I the only one who sees the holes in this book?,"The author is a big fan of plain old chicken wings and backs. Chicken backs seem the form a huge portion of her dogs' diets.Chicken wings and backs alone are WAY too bony.She is doing it to be as cheap as possible and in the process is feeding an incomplete diet.Your dogs' poops should NOT be white and chalky- that is a sign the dog is eating too much bone.It should also be mentioned somewhere in the book that raw pork can cause trichinosis and that freezing it for a month first will prevent this. She just recommends raw pork. Period.Yes, there is some good information in this book, but you need to do more research on your own and not feed by her personal dogs' menu, as it is lacking.This is a nice starter book to get over your fears of raw feeding, but that's about it."
3,Welcoming Raw Feeding Into Your Regimen,"Carina Beth MacDonald writes a funny and witty and reasonable accounting for her switch to raw feeding her animals. It is not a thorough book with extensive nutritional analyses. Furthermore, it does not advise monitoring levels of organ and digestive performance; there are better sources for that information. Mostly it's for the dog to appreciate raw food and for getting the dog's human comfortable with not feeling bad using raw bones, meat and acceptable parts in their animal's feeding. It entertained me, who feeds raw but not exclusively so; I could not convince my mother to convert for her dogs but it has inspired her to use better foods and ingredients, including raw mix-ins."
4,Almost Perfect,"Buy this book only if you have already read ""Raw Meaty Bones"" by Tom Lonsdale or a similar book that explains the science behind carnivore physiology and how dogs, cats, and other carnivores eat in the wild. Carina Beth is a genious at obtaining raw meat to feed her dogs at very low cost or even for free. But she also advocates feeding vegetables and supplements which your pet carnivores were never designed to eat; this issue was, for me, the only weak spot in this book.I also appreciated hearing about her experiences as she transitioned her dogs to a raw diet. She was very candid about her own questions and concerns and described in detail how she overcame them.But the greatest benefit of this book is the author's very strong organizational skills. Transitioning from conveniently store bought kibble to an all raw diet is not easy. It requires a great deal of planning and ingenuity. This book shortens the learning curve for those who are just starting out."
4,Nice investment for a novice raw feeder,"This book is good to have around as more of a confidence builder than anything else really. The author isn't a vet, nutritionist or any type of expert, so reading this book is a lot like just talking to an experience raw feeder & finding out what works for them. If you are looking for a nutritional breakdown of different foods, or meal plans etc, this probably isn't the one you are looking for. But, for $10 this is a worthwhile addition to a raw feeder's library. When I first started out raw feeding, not too long ago, I really just wanted a book that would tell me 'what' to feed, what IS a raw meaty bone?, Is this normal?, what to expect when....? etc. This book helps guide you in taking the first steps towards raw feeding."
3,not enough information,"I read a couple of books about feeding raw. I think the author of this book did not do enough research. The book is lacking on a chapter about vitamins and vegetables in detail and about diseases and ""what not to feed"". Also it is not really good structured. She also writes that she sometimes cooks for her dogs omelets?? Is that RAW DOG FOOD? How weird is that? There is nothing in the book about herbs as supplements. When reading it, it felt a little bit like she just wrote what came to her mind so you can believe her or not. She also tried to go over a frozen turkey with her truck or something like that. I might not have the right sense of humor but I think thats just stupid!"
4,"A rather intrigueing mix of history, humor, and religion.","This book makes a wonderful companion to the video series by the same name. Terry Jones does a great job of showing us, the layman, how bizzarely we, as people, acted and still do act, somtimes, in the name of religion. I quite enjoyed how he combines historical research with his own style of humor, thus making the book more readable to the average person. True, the book could have had more historical facts in it, but it would have distracted from an enjoyable and thought provoking story and would have read like a bad highschool textbook. This would make a good learning tool for students new to the subject."
2,Definitely Skimps On The Pate',"Serve Mr. Jones a fair share of credit for knowledge about the Crusades, nonetheless you'll go wantingeven after all four courses this documentary has to offer.Too cute by half.Almost utterly lacking in historical context, intricacy or scholarly objectivity.Ignores the politics, famines, plague, tribal enmities that were devastating and reshaping Europe and Asia Minor.Barely any acknowledgement of the invasions by the Seljuk Turks that helped instigate the first Crusade.Offers only the scantest mention of the importance of trade routes and mercantile power in determining medieval geopolitics.Virtually ignores the existence of an Islamic empire formed as much by the scimitar as by the Koran.Wish I could have learned more, but afraid I wasted my money and my time on this one.Now, where's that bucket?"
4,fair interpretation,this movie although being presented strangely was interesting. it gives the viewer a fair documentation of the injustices & atrocities committed by the crusaders.
3,very enjoyable.......,"this video is entertaining and enjoyable, and is wonderful to watch if youve just become interested in this history. the filming is elaborate and entertaining, the filming in the middle east is beautiful. worth a look, but not a really excellent resource on the crusades END"
1,Could learn very little about crusades,"If you want to learn something about the crusades you better look elsewhere.Terry Jones is slightly amuzing, however that is it. You don't have details . How many soldiers. How was the soldiers convinced to go in such a maddening enterprise. There is very litle about the Frank empire. Very disapointing. There are errors too 1) the swords of the so called ""turks"" were not curved and 2) the so called turks were not turks"
1,"Anti-Christian, but that's not the worst of it....","The worst of it is the ugly, brutal image of Terry Jones in a Speedo on the beach in front of Acre, trying to explain something about ... I couldn't even remember. I think I'm scarred for life. No one, no one, should be forced to watch that when trying to learn about history."
3,Propaganda? Make no mistake about it?,"Readers and viewers of this work should realize that history contains ugly realities to anyone's perspectives. Certainly, the Moorish hordes relegated Christians and Jews to Dimi status (mostly as a sort of tax strategy), looted, enslaved, and killed masses just like the crusaders, but THIS ISN'T A BOOK ABOUT THE ARABS!!!This same sort of 'prejuidcial history' is leveled against Noam Chomsky for his history of the Arab Israeli conflict and his focus on Israel and the U.S. As with critics of Chomsky, you should note that the author of the previous review makes no mention of the facts presented in the book. Why? Because he cannot refute them. Instead he accuses the authors of apologetic propaganda; exactly the exercise in which he is involved."
1,As balanced as Humpty-Dumpty,"Call this history? Try Monty Python and the Holy Grail for deeper insight, historical content and accuracy."
3,Not so complete documentary,"This was an O.K. documentary about the crusades, it just wasn't very thorough. It had a lot of interesting fact about the about the conditions the crusaders had to deal with, but not a whole lot of information about the people and events of the crusades. The documentary completely skips over the last four crusades or just sort of touches on them. Go to a book if you want consice information, buy this documentary if you want some not so informative, entertaining information. The documentary only talks about the conflict between Richard the Lion Heart and Saladin a little bit."
3,a basic funny documentary,"The price of this documentary is way too expensive for what it has to offer. Very basic quality filming and photography; If you want to start learning about the crusaders than maybe this would be a good start. If you already know all the basics about the crusaders than my advice would be ""Kingdom of Heaven"""
4,FITS YFZ-450 PRO-FLOW KIT,Bought for YFZ-450 PRO-FLOW Kit. Same part number as filter that ships with it. Buy it here cheaper!!
5,It's just great music,"Journey made so much great music, and this set hits all the high points. If you like the band, then you will love this set."
4,journey,"items arrived on time and the three cds were undamaged. pleased with overall purchase experience, have enjoyed listening to music from my high school/college days."
3,Clasis Elgart,Good listening music not so good for daninc. It's too bad that modern music caters to those who have no understanding of what good music is.
1,A complete piece of junk,This tool is a compete piece of junk. What was I expecting for $10? Don't waste your time.On one of the cutter assemblies the hole that clamps onto the cross bar was machined oversize so it was just barely possible to tighten the socket screw enough to hold it firmly in place on the cross bar. After a little use I could not tighten the screw enough to hold the cutter assembly in place.After cutting one hole the cross bar that holds the cutter developed play where it fits into the center mandrill. This allows the cutters to chatter badly.There is a safety nut on each end of the cross bar the keeps the cutter assemblies from spinning off should they become loose. Both safety nuts keep loosening and falling off. There is no lock washer so of course these are going to vibrate loose. If this was the only problem you could install your own lock washer.
3,It is Okay if you are willing to tune it.,"The tool had some play in the horizontal armature. Be sure to tighten down the armature using the provided Allen wrench or an equivalent with more leverage. Tighten good. To tighten, you need to remove the center bit to access the screw underneath and the cutting side bits to avoid cutting yourself while tightening. It is also a good idea to hold the tool in a vice during this process. I purchased to cut out centering rings and bulk head caps from hobby aircraft plywood for high power rockets."
3,"The films are great, the packaging is garbage","A reasonably good selection of noir films, particularly for the price (Detour, DOA and He Walked By Night are worth the price by themselves). While we have not viewed all of the movies yet, the ones we have watched were of very adequate quality.My only complaint is the total piece-of-trash box they put this in. Ours arrived with three of the five disc holders broken, and the discs were badly scuffed from banging around in this box loose during shipping. I wondered if they would even play, but it does not seem to have effected their performance. Once it has been opened and closed three or four times, the plastic case itself comes to pieces. This packaging is crap!Good films and worth the price, but get yourself five individual jewel cases in advance because you're going to want to fling this sorry box as far as you can."
3,Good Book - Way Too Long- Good 4 Women- Men Look Elsewhere!,This book expresses an interesting perspective about the interactions between men and women. I think it is a good choice for women to read. But if you are male may I suggest you read (STUMBLING NAKED IN THE DARK: OVERCOMING MISTAKES MEN MAKE WITH WOMEN.) There is no better and more helpful book in the world for single men. Period. It changed the way I view dating and relationships forever and has helped me to feel much more relaxed and confident with women.
2,too much psycho babble,"I found this book too be a little depressing and misguiding. The author gives many examples and discussions of realtionships that went wrong which may be helpful in deciding to get out of a relationship but doesn't do much to help find a good one. The viewpoint is definitely biased towards the female side of what intimacy should be like which I feel is unfair to men and not helpful. Men are men, thank goodness. The author also prescribes to the idea that no one will love you unless you love yourself, that you have to get past your fears of intimacy before you will find the right person and that commitment phobes are people with ""issues"" (as opposed to being just your standard every day jerk). In general the book is unmotivating and not real world."
2,Still Single,"Very slow read, and possible out dated for today. Doesn't cover internet dating very well. This was the 1998 published date"
3,"Step one, find a huge group of availble partners","If you really don't know how to attract a mate, are subconsciously avoiding finding one, or tend to make poor choices....this book is for you. On the other hand, if you would love to find the perfect life partner but are limited by the number of available people of the same sexual orientation, age, attractiveness or social class, this book will not help you. It depends heavily on your having a reasonably large dating pool. She makes it sound like everyone has enough people in their social circle to create an endless reject list if necessary."
3,Loved the title and thought why not?,"I have quite a few girlfriends who are wonderful and single and most of them not too picky in a mate so I bought the book for us. So far I have just read it.It tells you things you already know but choose to ignore so that reinforcement is always good. The author does seem to be all caught up in the HIV/AIDS issue which I don't think is necessarily needed - perhaps for the older reader? I had to look to see when this was first published...Given the choice again, I would not purchase it except for the title..."
5,Deeper Look at Dating and Relationships,"I try and read most dating advice books since I am an expert in that field. This book definitely stands out from the pack, in that it addresses some of the deeper issues that might be keeping you single. First she tackles the feelings of ambivalence that many people have about getting an intimate life partner. Commitment phobia is another issue she tackles and how to avoid being in a relationship with someone who has it. Having a plan to change your single status with actual goals and accountability is also emphasized. I highly recommend this book if you want to go beyond the often superficial dating advice. Power Path to Love"
5,real life examination,"This book leads you through some examples and exercises that if you really take the time to consider, could change your life. Its not a lot of mumbo jumbo saying the same thing, over and over again, just a different way. It makes YOU do the work examining your choices and your preferences. I recommend to many women AND men that arent getting what they want out of relationships."
4,Very interesting and useable helpful hints,Very interesting hints and points how to meet people who match with your intrests and needs.
2,"I hated this book. Yes, hated.","I like reading anything that helps me discover new things about myself. I picked up this book because of the title. I thought it would make me really think about myself and open things up and reveal things I'd never thought of before....After reading it, I felt like a loser and that I was unfit for a relationship. I wasn't encouraged by it, at all. I felt like a freak and like I had just... YEARS of work to do. I felt awful after reading it and I don't recommend it to anyone. I think I actually threw this book away."
1,Not very helpful,"I found that the author makes several false assumptions as to why people are single. The suggestions were not relevant, helpful or useful in any way. I've wasted my time and money on this book. I do not recommend."
3,"Great book, but","Good book, but I didn't like it as much as ""If Your Parents Divorced, Will You Too?"" Being from a divorced home really influences our choice of spouse!"
3,there are better books out there,This particular book was very hard on the eyes to read and I found it difficult to stick with it. There are other books available that present the same information in a much more user friendly manner.
5,"THE book to change your life, it did mine!","Susan Page has manage to write a book that is so clear, persuasive, prescriptive and full of heart that it should be the Bible for anyone searching for love. I bought the book in March and read it, did the exercises, and examined my own needs and patterns. I began a serious search for The One and, believe it or not, I found him. Yes, I had to go out of state, and yes, I found an online search that worked better for me than [...], but without this book, I'm absolutely certain I would not have found the man of my dreams. I am now engaged and plan to marry in a year. Thank you, Susan!"
2,Letters by Sarah Orne Jewett,"I was very disappointed in the physical aspects of this book. It appears to be typed and then reproduced on a copy machine. It is very hard to read and has led to me putting the book down instead of reading it. In addition, the print is very light and adds to the difficulty of reading. Sarah Orne Jewett deserves better than this. I can't reccomend this as a purchase for anyone - not the fault of the author."
4,MORE! Please!!,"This is really a Great concept. Building an army from scratch and choosing which option for the army develop when it increased experience. Problem is Fame is really USESLESS except in healing troops. The campaigns,though lots of battles and great history, once it ends the game really ends. THERE should be option for random battles of U vs the computer. Also maybe create an option for creating a Rebel army with Spatacus. What about really re-creating a battle but in a lesser scale and let u fight it out. If they would combine the game of Legion Arena with Chariots, stratgy and combat they would really have a great game system to expand on. Over all I would give it a 4.26 for fun but the fun need to last more!"
1,Too Many Mistakes,"I wanted to provide feedback on this book. I am shocked at how many mistakes I've found in the examples, Q&A, workshops, and exercises.I had some basic understanding of SQL before I started reading this book, but am trying to learn from this book to better my foundation of knowledge of SQL. Unfortunately, too many times I hit yet another mistake in the book that causes me to have to figure out the problem by working around the book, not with it, or worse, I may not be certain I've even understood the concept to due several contradictions between the conceptual material and the examples/exercises.Learning a database language by unlearning mistakes in the training material is not the right way to learn anything.I have the third edition. I have not seen the fourth edition, but my confidence is not strong the issues will have been ironed out (they haven't been by the third edition)."
2,Badly organized,"I have a solid knowldege of conceptual data modelling but had no knowledge of SQL. This book, although containing the required information, is very badly organized. Examples are given before you can try them out, since you build the tables at a later stage. The ""hour"" discussing normalization is simply misleading and shows an example completely unrelated to the normalization rule it is supposed to apply. I used Oracle SQL and found that a lot of the examples didn't work in Oracle SQL environment. Maybe it takes less than 24 hours (I agree, it takes much less) but the time it takes is very frustrating. I simply didn't enjoy learning with this book."
1,Editor needed,"This book is full of typos, bad examples and bad code. The only way you learn SQL through this book is by researching the error codes you receive on messageboards. There is no help through the website. The website tries to sell you additional product. Save your money. Save your sanity. Get a different book."
3,they look cool but could be a little better,"I ordered two and they look cool, just like the picture but the craftsmanship could've been better. All 3 claws are not aligned perfectly, they are off just a bit. Maybe a little nit picky but not bad for the price i guess. ps i only give 5 stars if its a steal and they werent on sale. :]"
1,awful,"This program doesn't match the right words in many of the vocabulary exercises. It is designed for a very low level of learning, somewhere in the junior high level. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone."
2,Not recomended for the practical minded,"This book is nicely written in an academic way. If you are writing a romance novel in which one of the principle characters is a colleage professor who starts muttering incoherent psycho-babble just when he is supposed to get romantic, then this book will be an invaluable source. Intelectual and charming is how I would discribe this book. But not practical.If you want some down and dirty know-how on the nuts-and-bolts of seduction, read books by Don Steele and Ron Louis. These two are the best."
1,Skip this (self-published) book --,"Sorry, this book is horrible. The negative reviews are right on. The positive reviews seem to be highly bogus.....(1) The book is horribly written, hard to follow, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive,(2) the book is NOT based on research or empirical evidence, but on the author's (it doesn't even seem like he has a bachelor's degree) ""theories"", like there are only two kinds of people, liberal and conservative-- learn what someone is, and presto-- they will fall in love with you.(3) This book will simply not help you. There are no secrets here, no cool ideas, no insight.(4) You will be sad if you by this book--- you will know immediately when you open it that you have wasted your money, AND, if you do read it--- i actually did--- you will feel horrible--- it is a boring, tedious, WASTE OF TIME!(5) if you do buy the book, and i'm not 100% dead-on-right, email me, and i will publically repent."
3,An Interesting book,"Some interesting thoughts in this book. Though I did think theauthor rather cold in his approach to seduction, rather like areptile in his emotions toward the opposite sex. (...)"
2,Power of Seduction,"This book was in good condition and sent quickly enough, but I was expecting more of a psyshology type book and not historical rhetoric. I didn't return the book because I was out of town for an extended period of time and felt too much time had lapsed, otherwise I would have returned it. I didn't see anywhere in the product description that this was more of a historical synopsis rather than a psychology book."
4,Excellent points!,"This is an extraordinarily helpful book. It is wordy and can somewhat loose the reader. When reading this book it is advisable to find the main points and utilize them. There is no real need for defining the points. It is either within one's ability to process or it's not. If you want to read a simpler, similar book, I've been told that Dr. Grey's book, Mars and Venus is good. In my opinion it's worth the read. AND his footnotes and sources are verifiable."
5,Great book!,"This book has great recipes. It really is food you might want to eat. I started out cooking the Tandoori(ish) chicken (page 122). I love how they don't require fancy gadgets or gizmos to really cook this food. None of the recipes are pretentious or fussy. He does give some great advice on hosting parties or making an even special, but they are just suggestions. Most of his food his something you would have no problem making with items on hand. He also gives suggested wine parings, which I really enjoyed. I made this recipe, see my review on my blog: [...]I think the next one I'm going to try from this book is the fried chicken. It looks really straightforward, easy, and delicious."
5,The Food You Want To Eat,"Love the book, great recepies and the ones I've tried are tasty and easy. Book has a cover that wipes clean - always a plus."
3,Not for a Chef; Great for a Beginner,"If you are a great cook, and you've cooked for 20 years and can whip up a gourmet meal with your eyes closed in the middle of a tornado with only one spatula and a rabbit ...this is not the book for you.It is, however, a GREAT book for a beginner cook--like my son who will graduate from college this year and probably starve for not knowing how to cook the kinds of meals he gets at home.Allen does not try to impress or intimidate: he tries to make it easy. He tries to make it taste good. This is not Betty Crocker-dull basics, this is the next step up.Yep, this will be a graduation gift for sure."
3,disappointed!,"Purchased this Excalibur handheld computer and had many hours of enjoyment, until the liquid display (LCD) faded. Changed batteries and got the same results. A backlight on these handheld chess games would be nice.The price on this new one is way to much. I paid only $20.00 at a department store a few years ago. Do not know where to send it for repair. The cost may be as much as a new one would cost today."
4,Chess game is an excellent way to learn.,"I bought 3 Handheld LCD Chess & Checkers Game of them for a small group of young people on our chess team. It's great for the beginner to more experienced. Want a more difficult opponent? - just turn up the difficulty number: 1-73. It can humble some of the best, and build confidence for the lower level players. Moving pieces takes some getting used to, but after 20 minutes or so it's easy. I like it's portability, no need to attach to another device, etc. It even moves quickly if desired. Also has a 'hint' button. Keeps the interest level up."
5,Among the best,"In terms of technique and interpretation, the version of the Diabelli Variations ranks with the best available. Do not let the fact that Chen is a less well known pianist scare you away."
5,Fantastic! Viking bards jam with heavy metal musicians,"If some viking bards got caught in a time warp and met up with some heavy metal musicians, this is what I would expect to hear. The grooves, themes, and instruments of the traditional music blend seamlessly with the modern instruments and unmistakable metal attitude and style. I could not believe it when I first heard it. It totally WORKS musically. You really have to hear it to believe it, but I have played this for metal heads and people who don't much care for metal, and everyone loves it.The musicianship is outstanding, and the grooves just won't let you sit still. This is one of my all-time favorite albums."
1,Item offered is not item listed,the item offered for sale is VOLUME 23 NOT (I REPEAT - NOT) the Volume 1 shown at the top of the page -- BEWARE!!
5,future rock,"this band is not what you would call ""pop culture"". so if you are looking for creed's new ""hit"" look somewhere else. however, this band is culture because it hits you like nothing ever before. nothing i say will incline you more so listen,experience, and see for yourself.ww(...)"
3,Inefficient,"Studying for the PE for most people is about using time wisely. I found this practice exam to be challenging, very time consuming, and while I learned a good deal, much of it was on theories, solutions, and subjects that won't show up on the exams. I found the NCEES practice exams to be of much better help since they were much more in line with the actual exam subject material. While it took me an average of about 5 mins to finish the NCEES practice problems, I found myself spending at the very min 5 mins on each problem up to close to 25 mins on this practice test. If you have spare time to kill before your exam like I did, then it can never hurt to look at this. Just don't fret when you are going through it, just keep in mind it is much more difficult than the actual examination."
2,"Buy the NCEES ""Practice Exam"" instead","If you're looking for a realistic practice test, buy the ""Sample Questions & Solutions"" published by NCEESPE Mechanical Sample Questions and Solutions Book; it is very similar to the real exam. Just like the rest of Lindeburg's review material, this is definitely a higher level of difficulty than the real test. Certainly does not live up to the cover page billing of, ""The most realistic practice you can get for the mechanical PE exam."""
3,Not worth it,"I was looking for a good practice test for the PE and I previously used Lindeburg's book for the FE test and was happy with it... but this one let me down. The problems are a little rediculous for something that is supposed to be solved in 6 minutes. I'd recommend the book by NCEES, it seems much more realistic."
3,More difficult than actual exam problems,"I passed the actual PE Exam on my first attempt and I still can't pass the practice exam in this book! The questions in this book are far more difficult than those on the actual PE Exam. If you can get through this practice exam, you should be all set. I would suggest the Six-Minute Solutions for Mechanical PE Exam (HVAC and Refrigeration Problems), as it more accurately portrayed the actual level of difficulty of exam problems."
2,"Problems too long, complicated","I found this sample exam to be of little use because the problems were much more difficult than the actual test. I suppose it is good to be overprepared, but after doing this practice exam I was concerned I might not finish the exam on time, only to finish each session over an hour early. It also covered strange topics, often required ""reasonable assumptions"" and did not give much relevant data, none of which were the case on the actual exam. I do not recommend it."
3,Does not last long,It was working good when I first got it. It started dropping connection after about 5 months. I ended up replaced it.
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!,"This book is EXTREMELY boring. It's painful to read. It's written like the college textbook from hell!!!!!!!Look on the bright side though, it will help you sleep if you're an insomniac.Can you say, ""Waste O Money"""
4,Book Review,I must say that this book was extremely enlightening. it is a book that will captivate you and encourage you to read from beginning to end. it is informal and i strongly believe that with a bit of practice that i will get better. this book is not a miracle worker however with time you will get better.
5,Amazing!!,"The author was so right, how you sound is a big part of the impression you make. In just a short time after reading Voice Power I could tell my voice was stronger, more convincing and commanding. People actually listen to me when I speak! I think everyone needs to read this book."
4,Public Speakers Should Read This Now,"I was impressed that the author sought to train and not to impress.You will learn what you do wrong and then you learn how to correct it. Without recognizing your speaking problems (ALL of them, not just one such as a fear of speaking in public), you won't be a better speaker."
1,Worst book I bought on Amazon,"I did not like this book at all. I speak clearly but I want to be more articulate and hold my ""audiences"" attention.The breathing exercises and banging out the ZZZZs and EE-I-EE-I-OOs did not help me. Maybe I just don't understand what the author is trying to get across so it could actually be good information.I also agree with one of the earlier reviewers that this author seems to just drop a lot of names. It got a little old after a while."
3,Good Book but Not Without Coach,"It is a good resource but you will be able to improve not as much as this book has promised, Because you need a coach or trainer in order to get the most out of it."
2,out of date,"i have returned this book due to the fact that is an out-of-date reprint from the 1980's which is not in the books description. the photography is also very 1980's: grainy and not always natural in color. if this is your first book, it is okay. but if you are looking for up-to-date info, this is not for you."
2,Only useful if you're taking the class,"This book is so high level and generic that is doesn't serve much of a purpose other than to get one thinking about how much information (knowledge) there is in an organization to capture. There are many references made throughout the book for the need for systems to capture institutional knowledge, but not one detail about actually applying a practical solution within an organization. Unless you're taking the writer's graduate class, save your money."
5,Aunt Batty and Eliza's Guardian Angel . . .,". . . and things not being what they seem. Lynn Austin weaves the consequences of bitterness, deceit into a satisfying tale of redemption and fresh starts. Lots of heart, some humor and a whole lot of trying to figure out why people do what they do."
2,Not a believable story line,"I have read some other books by this author (i.e., Eve's Daughters) which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, the characters in Hidden Places were not believable. Aunt Batty was a bit too much. And Eliza's background? Really?? I didn't like that some of the characters were portrayed as such wonderful people, but they were liars and their lives were based on lies. I do enjoy reading Christian fiction, but not this one. I was disappointed with the book."
5,Highly recommend,"I read my first Lynn Austin book several years ago and have since rediscovered her as an author. So far, this is one of my favorites. The first person narrative and way of revealing the storyline is suprisingly unpredictable. The characters are rich and easily identifiable. The conversations are authentic and it was easy to imagine life on a sprawling Orchard during the Great Depression. It was a bit romanticized (as would be expected), but overall - it conveyed the heartache of a difficult time as well as the hardships of each character.Great read, wonderful characters, and beautiful story of redemption and reconciliation!"
5,favorite book ever,When people ask me what my favorite book is I always say Hidden Places...I love this book!
4,GREAT BOOK!!!,This book is wonderful! The plot twists are fantastic and keep the reader entranced throughout the whole book. It never slows down which makes for a great book!!
5,'Hidden Places' Is Fabulous!!!,"With her masterful tale of buried family secrets and a search for love, Lynn Austin has delivered another intricately crafted story that will keep you reading until the early hours of the morning. Be prepared to ride in a roller coaster of emotions; you will laugh, cry, and learn along with Eliza about the love that heals all hurts.'Hidden Places' is absolutely wonderful!"
3,Touching Yet Distant,I didn't become as attached to the characters within Hidden Places as I did in Eve's Daughters. It could be because each of the main characters were built from a house of cards or it could be that the situation was contrived.Disappointed by the time of the conclusion.
3,Hidden Places,Book recvd in excellent shape. Have not gotten to read it yet but lookforward to doing so. THANKS
5,i think i'm in love...,"These guys have totally restored my faith in ""indie rock"" through and through. Their music is complex, melodic, different, and insanely catchy, something that is rare in today's ""let's go through old proto punk LPs and rip off songs"" alternative scene. Shreds of post punk, hardcore, and ""emo"" are woven together seamlessly, making for an interesting and original listen. This band should appeal to fans of any genre, because it's just plain good.This, folks is the cutting edge."
5,It took me a little bit to really get into this...it's pretty incredible,"I think no kill no beep beep is far and away their best album. Ian did an outstanding job producing. I liked this cd more and more each month and each year. 7 years later and I am still blown away by this release. Not super crazy about differen damage, for me this is where its at. RADICAL!!!!!"
1,the O and not 1,"is there any surprise that these kids are with dischord records? i mean, if you dig their sound, hear that from which it echoes... that's right.. theeze guys want to be fugazi so bad, not only can you hear it but you see it in their album titles. buy Fugazi instead."
2,You get what you pay for,"Vice was easy to install but it's extremely crooked, it clamps in the shape of a 'V'. Not recommended for anything more than the most basic of required situations.I spent 2 hours planing my two face boards into uneven shapes so that this thing will actually clamp right. Still awful, but better than before.I'd rather save and buy a vice that works properly next time."
5,Bang for your buck,I needed something that would do the job without spending alot of money. This product worked. It is not for everyday users or heavy work that needs to take a beating. This will work for light to medium use.
4,Great Vise for the Price,"This vise is well made, sturdy and easy to mount on your workbench. It is well worth the money - a good buy."
3,Caution when mounting...,"---The mounting holes are not symmetrical!---Maybe there was an instruction manual in the box that I threw away before reading indicating this, but I can't think of a reason why the holes wouldn't be the same on either side. I had to drill the holes from the top-down and incorrectly assumed that I could just turn the vise over (so the flanges would be flush with the bench-top while drilling). Because the holes are in slightly different places, none of the bolts I was using through the bench lined up with the vice's holes.Some dowel and wood-glue to fill the misplaced holes, and I was able to install it correctly. Haven't really used it yet, but I guess it seems sturdy enough for the money."
4,shop fox d2255 8-inch wood vice,"very good for price, but needs shimming on bench, wood jaws need tapering. I would recommend this vice for small shops"
3,Just average,Wanted a second wood vise for my work bench and didn't want to spend a lot. Works fine. Nothing special about it but it works.
4,The nicest book on Labradors,"I don't have a Labrador, but my friend borrowed it since she was going to buy a Labrador puppy and she found it helpful. And it's nice to look at, easy to transport, interesting, and the pics are nice."
5,Oban Star series,This series was a Christmas request from my Grand daughter. I know she will be happy with it and I was happy with the ordering and delivery. It arrived on time and in good condition.Kathy
4,Biography of Audrey Hepburn,"It was exactly what I needed to complete my paper. It was difficult finding other sources, but this one had a lot of bibliographical information as additional resources"
2,I think it is very vague,"I didn't apprecite it. As I haven't had any information of Audrey's life, I enjoyed knowing facts of her life. But the biography misses her personal experience at all! She goes through four abortions and the writer doens't give any importance at all to those facts! He has very detals of her years in Holland and the importance of her mother, but when she becomes famous, the mother is suddently out of the picture. As I said, her personal evolution is suddently forgot. It seens as there was two Audreys, the one that grewn up in nazist Holland and the one that made fame on movies. The pictures are very poor and of low quality. I brought the book knowing nothing about Audrey, and I finish reading it knowing less. Don't bother to get that book, there are betters of her."
1,Good concept,"I'm a tradesman and I'm a bit tough on tools at times, however this crescent broke the first time I used it. It is an excellent concept. I really didn't want to give this 1 star but that is all it deserves. I would like to believe I got a dud but I doubt it."
2,not durable,"I wanted to like this because it is a good idea. The implementation is jsut poorly done.I bought one and it broke--the slider lost it's position, so it no longer opened the jaw all the way. I returned it, and the second eventually did the same.I returned it too. Maybe version 2 will be dependable."
2,Poor quality,"Appears to be Chinese construction. Slider mechanism catches at certin points, without apparent cause. Added oil and gentle touch, little or no good effect noticed. Wiggling the jaws helps the slider move, but not convenient or a one hand tool like the old Crescent wrenches. I'll keep my Crescent wrench with the knurled thumb screw from the past and return this one."
1,Crescent Rapid Slider,"Cresant 8"" Rapid Slider was given me as a gift. Having tried to use it I was glad my money wasn't shelled out for this poor example of a Crescent product. All those who appraise it must not use tools on a regular basis and no doubt have a tool box full of left handed monkey wrenches.It appears there is a problen with the mesh of the gearing and moving the slide adjustment, slow or fast, causes the gears to jump position. A regular box or open end wrench is better to use and less frustrating.Crescent AC8NKWMP 8-Inch Rapid Slide Adjustable Wrench"
1,Poor machining. Just a gimmicky gadget that isn;t as good as traditional.,"This wrench is way too and bulky and heavy for what it is, which can mean a lot to a guy who carries one in his back pocket all day.The slide adjust is just a gimmick. It is made to attract tool shoppers, not tool users. The more I use it, the more it irritates me. It is rough and hangs up in both directions. It will not hold an adjustment, and must be readjusted every time you grip the same nut or bolt. I keep waiting for it to break in, but no relief in sight. I have had to clean it out several times just to get it to start working again.The jaws are very soft, and deform easily.This is from a country that still has not been able to make a decent copy of the decent standard Crescent wrench.Save your money. If you need to buy an 8"" Crescent wrench, buy a US standard design from a good US factory at a garage sale or swap meet."
3,Convenient for Clean Environments...But that's all.,Slide Channel can fill up with dirt and clog the mechanics. Holds a good size; no play in the mouth.
2,MADE IN CHINA,This wrench is made in China. I was told by a representative at the Crescent website that it was made in the U.S.A. They lied. If you are O.K. with using low quality Chinese tools then you will be satisfied with this product. Many good tool brand names are now pushing Chinese made tools. Buyer beware.
4,The Mystic Christ,"I think Ethan Walker has done a fine job of presenting Christ as one of many avatars who have appeared when needed to those on the path to truth. I particularly enjoyed his exploration of the ego as the thing that hinders the knowledge of our true nature. Overall, a provacative book. I shared it with several like-minded individuals who also enjoyed it."
5,The Crystal Palace: A Tale from the Gold Country,"I believe Amazon got the age wrong. It is appropriate for children younger than 9 years. My 8-year-old daughter loves this book! The pictures are imaginative, colorful and detailed. The fanciful prose allows kids to use their imaginations, and the history lessons are fun. Delightful book. I heartily recommend it."
1,Size is really 7 1/5 inches,"Although this states it's s 9"" stand, it really only measures about 7 1/2 inches. I already had a 7"" stand that was too small for my project. Now I have extra shipping charges for returning the item because it was mislabeled."
5,Mediocre? Absolutely not! It rulled!,"Wrestlemania V is one of the best wrestlemanias of all-time and this PPV had a higher buyrate than some of the wrestlemanias in recent years. Randy Savage-Hulk Hogan was a great match and when the Macho Man hit the flying elbow, I thought Hogan was done. In fact, Hogan should have put Savage over that night, but instead, Savage lost. Strike Force v.s. the Brain Busters was a great match until Martel walked out, shattering one of the most beloved teams in the WWF. Demolition dominated the Powers of Pain. Overall, Wrestlemania was great (...)."
3,A good main event but that's it.,Every match was boring all 1 star match's only 2 good match's which are Warrior vs Rick Rude which was in alright match but the warrior get's screwed 7/10 and the MainEvet which was a good Main event but i have seen better on wrestlemania's i give this match an 8/10 overall i would give this wrestlermania 7/10 a pretty good WM but i have seen better.
4,"great old school wwf, but why did they edit piper's pit?","I recently purchased a few of the old wwf tapes which titan productions released, and was wondering why they edited the piper's pit segment with Morton Downey Jr? Also, you get a little sick and tired of Gorilla Monsoon saying ""History has been made here at Wrestlemania, Jess!"""
3,WWF WrestleMania 5: Mega-Powers Explode! Review,"The only super thing about this card was the Intercontinental Title match and the main event. The IC match pitted The Ultimate Warrior against ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude. Rude beat Warrior unfairly when Bobby Heenan grabbed his legs out from under him and held onto them while Rude got the pinfall. The main event was a solid match with ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage going against ""Hulk"" Hogan for the WWF Title. Savage hit Hogan with the Macho Elbow but he kicked out. Then Hulk big booted Savage and hit him with the Immortal Leg Drop. It gets a three because of the mediocre undercard."
3,got what I paid for,The book had writing and highlighting in a few chapters but was overall in ok condition which is what I paid for. Arrived in the set amount of time
5,A drop of water in the ocean.,"""Myself a Mandarin"" is one of those books that anyone interested in China must read.Not quite 250 pages long it's a fast, easy, entertaining but always thought-provoking work.The nuances of Chinese culture with its regional varieties are made accessible withoutleading the reader to falsely assume that (s)he actually understands more than (s)he does.If anything, it makes it clear how difficult it is for the Western reader/student of Chinato truly understand the world's longest-lasting civilisation.Most importantly, Coates makes it clear that no matter what our intentions are in dealingwith China, or for that matter, East Asia in general, we will never make a greatcontribution to their society. Even our greatest scholars, or greatest writers, ourgreatest administrators will never contribute more than the smallest drop of water intothe ocean of China."
3,"Wonderful prose, but dated information","I love Bill Jordan's writing, and this book contains a few great stories, but most of the practical information is very dated. If you want information on practical revolver shooting circa 1965, then this is for you. If you want to know about modern calibers, pistol types, holsters, and tactics, then keep looking."
5,"Jump on my nose, jump on my nose!","This is my 4 yr old's favorite book! The teachers incorporated this item into the library and they told me it was his favorite book at school, so we got one for home too! We added the audio to iPod so we can listen in the car and when we're just idle :)"
2,This is NOT a big book.,"I bought this book to use in my pre-k classroom. I was excited to find a large version of it online, but this book is not big, it is about 10 inches wide. I was hoping to use it as a read-aloud, but the pictures were so small that most of my students were not able to see them. I love Galdone's version of the story, but the title is misleading."
4,Traditional story,Great story. Just wish the refrain spoken by the Gingerbread boy rhymed. The pictures are very nice though the size of the book is rather small.
5,Classic for grandchildren,We selected this book and several others because we want our grandchildren to have classics.
4,A funny cookie,My two-year-old daughter says:It's funny. Run away and catch the cow. And catch the horsie. And catch the guys. And a guy talking. And a cookie talking. The food talking. A cow run away. And a fox eat the cookie man.
3,Gingerbread boy,"I don't understand why it is Gingerbread Boy instead of Gingerbread Man. That is how the original story is and my Grandson is disappointed because in school it is Man. It is hard to read, not full screen unless I just don't have the settings right. Probably won't read very often."
5,Great children's book!,This book is a classic! The illustrations just jump off the page. My children loved this book and now my grandchildren love it!
5,Hugo Alfven: Midsommarvaka/Symphony No.2 in D Major Op.11,Hugo Alfven: Midsommarvaka/Symphony No.2 in D Major Op.11 is a 1988 Grammofon AB BIS recording starring Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra under direction of Neeme Jarvi. Sound quality is great and I feels as if one was listening to this recording in person. Amazing performance by Stockholm Symphony Orchestra. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
4,Cats LOVE this!,"This is the good stuff my cats come running for!This is a jar of dried fish ""shavings."" They're paper thin, and cats ADORE them. I have to hide the jar, because if I don't, I find the jar in the morning with little kitty tooth marks all over it, from them trying to get it open. LOL.This stuff is such a big hit at my house, that I have taught my cats tricks- like to ""Sit"" on command, in exchange for this treat- that's how much they love it.Best of all, I have a cat whose tummy gets upset easily, and she never gets sick after eating this like she did with other kinds of treats. This is 100% pure dried fish- NO fillers, which is great.I deducted one star because these shavings tend to turn to powder in the bottom of the jar, which makes the cats sneeze so I usually have to throw a tiny bit of it away- but it is a very small portion compared to the size of the container.Overall, this is a great product, healthy and makes kitties VERY happy. I buy it regularly."
2,Pay more for a better one,"This fountain is okay...but it is not the best. The first time I tried to use it, the auger came off the base and slung chocolate everywhere. I made sure the chocolate was completetly melted and I had to add so much oil that is was as thin as water so I know it was right. The auger/pump does not have anything securing it to the base, it just sits there so it is very loose. If any type of debris (strwberry seed, tiny chunk of fruit, etc) gets in the chocolate, the auger could possibly come off the base and sling chocolate like it did on me. Spend an extra 20 or 30 on a better fountain if you want better quality."
3,Author has (still) untapped talent,"This guy seems to have the potential of doing some interesting writing. This book didn't quite hit the mark, however. For example, he is riding the Alaska Ferry down the inside passage and doesn't tell us about the scenery, more about himself and a few mildly interesting other people and alot about the food he eats along the way. Ho Hum.I'm waiting for his next book because I think he has it in him..somewhere!"
1,chimeless chimes,The woodstock hanging garden bells was a BIG disappointment. They look nice hanging in our Japanese Maple but they never make a sound unless you physically move them. We have had some very windy days but they remained silent...
5,"Bach: The Complete Organ Music, Vol. 6","Bach: The Complete Organ Music, Vol. 6 is a very fine recording with the very accomplished organist Hans Fagius. Being a devout Christian Bachs organ music not just speaks to my heart but also my soul. The book-let is sparse but not a cheap job by any means. The short essay written by Fagius is very informative and well-written. The photography on the back looks bad and one wonders if this was done by an amateur with a cheap camera. At least I hope so. Even so I give this recording 5 well-derserved stars."
5,good sturdy tool kit,tools seem sturdy. it comes in a nice zip case. it's good for a non-professional.
2,Too Thin,"I purchased these mits after having used an Orka mit and loving how well it protected my hand from hot pans, but wishing it were slightly more flexible. Well, this mit is definitely more flexible but not better for my hands. The heat has come right through on multiple occassions when I've picked up hot pans from the oven (like the Christmas Day Turkey in the roasting pan). I attribute this to the silicon being too soft and flexible. The weight of the pan handle just squishes it until it's very thing over your fingers and then the heat comes right on in. This always occurs around the edges/seams of the mit. Personally, I'm going back to the Orka mit. Yes it's not as flexible, but the point is being able to hold a hot pan and not feel like you're burning yourself. I've not had any problem with the Orca mit in grabbing any pan handles or edges. You just have to think about holding your hand in the right direction to grab it properly without fighting the glove."
2,left me pretty unsatisfied,"I really wanted to like this silicone glove be I just have to say it is no good beyond a few seconds of heat protection. My sister used it a lot one day baking cookies and she had to give up using it almost right away because it would not protect her from the heat. If you decide to try it, please be careful and take caution."
2,"Flexible, but not very insulating","Silicone has its advantages. The material itself is heat resistant, durable, and washes easily. And these mitts are certainly more flexible than most in this category of product. However, it must be noted, silicone is just not a good thermal insulator. You can't hold anything hot for than five seconds and you start to feel the heat come through. The cheapest pair of cotton mitts will protect your hands better than these high end silicone things. And given the extraordinary high price of silicone products, you could afford to buy new cotton oven mitts every year and still spend less than you do on these. Not a good value."
4,good overview look at digital video,"The book does a great job of offering an overview of digital video, including things like using still photos, what type of equipment would you need, and how to set-up a shoot.Only complaint is that the author occasionally states opinions as fact example: wide screen is better than standard, when in reality, it is an artistic choice, and it is how you use the space provided that makes something like widescreen better or worse."
4,exploring Digital Video,I purchased this for school at a much lower cost than purchasing through the school. It definitely was useful. I will continue to look for my school books on Amazon.
4,"A fantastic, emotional, page-turning read.","READ THIS BOOK! You don't have to be a transsexual, homosexual, male, or female to get a lot out of this book. I'm a married heterosexual female and read this book with an open mind, and am so glad I did so. Kholsa's transition from a female body to a male one that matched his male brain offers insights on the societal and biological constructs of gender and how our bodies are hard-wired to think and behave in certain ways by our hormones, our sociology, and so many other things. The fact that Kholsa has experienced both sides can help you learn more about yourself and the opposite sex than you ever thought possible.Written in gorgeous, dramatic prose that will keep you turning pages well into the wee hours. Fantastic! A great choice for your book club, too---sure to inspire hours of lively discussion."
4,Account of an Incredible Re-Birth,It's an intellectual book with alot of funny anecdotes. It provides insight as to a person's emotional and spiritual evolvement...the books speaks about many dreams during this transition. It seems to me that Dhillon was so determined to become his real person that the lines between the physical world and the dream world began to blend. It also demonstrates how this person grew spiritually....I mostly appreciated how he kept a kind heart during some very difficult times.
5,Excellent way to learn all history,"History from the beginning is presented in a very interesting way as would have been written if someone was reporting at that time. What I like is that you see what was happening in all parts of the world in a particular time, which makes you realize how advanced some civilizations were compared to others which were concurrent."
5,I loved this book!,"Young, pompous, naive Vincent leaves his small-town Illinois home to spread the gospel in Taiwan. Fortunately for him, his weaknesses lead him to numerous humiliations and considerable growing up. As he travels across China by train and bus he reads a Russian novel which gives him ""a deep and lingering solace to see in the novel's characters the same inner vacillation of intention and worry, the same moment-to-moment uncertainty that he felt almost every second of his waking life."" This story of the challenges of seemingly unbridgeable cultural gaps brings the gift of unpredictable moments of forgiveness and reconcilation."
5,Fantastic read,"I don't have time to write a review that will do this novel justice. Suffice it to say, I couldn't put it down, and the characters and ideas stayed in my mind long after I finished reading it. It was a completely beautiful, realistic, piece of literature. I strongly recommend it."
2,unexpected china experience,"The trials and tribulations of a young, Christian volunteer and English teacher, Vincent Saunders. I found the storyline to be somewhat predictable and the characters not very likable; however, the descriptions of the various locales were beautiful. I would recommend to those interested in missionary life and traveling."
1,Don't read unless you are really bored,"Just finished reading this 451 pages book.I think that the main character Vincent is pretty disgusting. He's weak, humble and miserable. When I was reading around page 400 I was tempted to close the book and return it, only the desire to find out how it all ended kept me from doing that.Vincent is the bold example of a man who is not in charge of his destiny, he is not even in charge of his house and his time. His coworker bullied him into going from house to house to advertise Bible study classes, she painted the walls of his house with her positive thinking quotes.So the verdict - unless you are really bored or interested in Chinese way of living - don't read it."
5,There may never be a more profound or amazing book...,"Breathe a sigh of relief and never second guess yourself or your loving, instinctual, attachment feelings again. If you've ever wondered which of the ""expert"" parenting methods are the ""right"" ones, read ""The Vital Touch"" not just for one more insight, but to follow the one expert that counts -- you."
5,MUST HAVE. Parenting BIBLE,This is the most amazing book ever. It changed my life. It has footnotes and references (so it's not a bunch of fluff). It validated my feelings on how I want to raise my child. And it broadened my perspective. I feel this book and the Ina May Guide to Childbirth are the two books that every woman/man who are interested in having children MUST have. They are essential.
5,This book will give you a whole new appreciation for the importance of human touch,Great book. I learned so much and have a new appreciation for why babies crave being held and touched so much.
5,An insightful book on the value of touch and the cultural development of convenience,"Sharon heller has written an insightful book on value of human touch during childhood. She analyzes from various cultural sources how we, Americans, have come to be one of the least tactile people in the world. She goes back in time, looking at our human evolution, analyzing why we and our children need touch and how we have fulfilled that need over time. Her analysis shows how, over the past century, we are moving away from our original mark-up in regards to human touch.This book also shows us how we can keep providing a nurturing environment for children in today's society and why this is so important. It is a wake-up call for everyone involved with children to keep human touch part of raising children in our modern world.Martine Groeneveld, AuthorMommy, Draw Stars on my Tummy; Rhymes, Songs and Touch-Play Activities to Stay Connected"
2,interesting reading,"I just recently re-read this book after it had been sitting on my shelf for a few years. It was very interesting to me to read about how other cultures raise babies and children. Definitely sparked my interest to read more on this topic. What I was disappointed in was the way the author seemed to brush off the importance of breastfeeding. This was surprising after she made a point of discussing how it is carried out routinely and for extended periods in other cultures. Quote from page 169: "" Of course there's no harm in bottle feeding, if we find this a more comfortable arrangement than nursing, or if we have no choice. Whole generations of infants have grown up on bottle milk and survived well enough."" (Heller, 1997) Hmmmmmm, La Leche League would be all over this statement."
3,Independent mom,"This book makes a fabulous point on how we need to be closer to our children, however, the rosy picture the author paints of other cultures is not accurate. East Indian mothers I know are exhaustd. Yes they recieve help from their own mothers for one month but after that they return to their husbands home where in many cases its a joint household. The daughter-in-law is on the bottom of the pecking order and her needs come last. Her child is taken care of by her in-laws, and usually is allowed to do anything he/she wants. The mother is not allowed to discipline the child. In fact, the mother is dependent on everyone else in the household and does not have the freedom to make decisions on her own. Many mothers I have met are incredibly unhappy in this situation. America is not all that bad. We are able to decide to touch our child more if we wish, which may not be the case in many other cultures."
3,Good For Price!,Well the quality wasn't great and the audio was pretty good but it's completely worth the price! The way it was shipped in like a vacumm bag was no protection at all! One of the disc's was loose so it had scratches
1,Groucho Marx?!?!?!?!?,"I have all these Bela Lugosi movies on other collections. (They do keep cropping up.) I read the description only because I was intrigued by the inclusion of Groucho Marx as one of the actors...in fact, the only actor mentioned aside from Lugosi himself. I'm something of an authority on Bela Lugosi, having been watching his movies since the late 50s when I was in high school. Nowhere, in any of his movies, to my knowledge, does Groucho Marx appear. If someone can explain this to my satisfaction, I will be more than happy to buy that person a glass of wine...or blood?"
3,"Only OK tasting, leaking cans",The taste of the sardines is OK but not great and they have a strange metallic after taste that is a little annoying. Out of the twelve in the case one of the cans leaked which left oil over many other cans and soaked through the inner box and the UPS box which was a mess. I won't purchase them again.
3,Product is fair,"Sardines are one of my favorite foods: delicious and healthy! I generally love Crown Prince brand and was glad to see that these sardines are ""wild-caught,"" two-layer, and packing in olive oil. However, I would rate the taste as only ""fair"" and would not purchase this paritcular product again."
3,dry meat,"my previous experience with sardines was mostly with the grocery-store bought canned in tomato sauce variety. this is the first time i have brisling. i don't know if brisling's supposed to be drier than the bigger sardines, but i definitely noticed that the fish here is pretty dry despite being canned in olive oil. it tastes very mild -too mild for my taste compared to regular sardines. but mainly my complaint is the dryness. i see that other reviewers have written that crown prince has drier sardines than king oscar. too bad their brisling is not offered on amazon."
5,Delicious,Some of the better tasting sardines I've came across. I was buying them locally until I found them here. The cost of buying them in bulk for a cheaper price pleases me.
4,"""Wild-caught"" .... in managed fisheries","Written on the front of the box in cursive script is: Wild CaughtThen I turn the box over and read: From managed fisheriesI recommend King Oscar sardines, which are succulent.*****UPDATED REVIEW*****After reading about ""managed fisheries""; It seems like they are not such a bad idea."
3,it improve my cholesterol numbers,"These sardines are great, especially for people who haven't had sardines before. I hardly notice the bones and skin. I eat 2-3 tins per week to help improve my cholesterol numbers. My favorite ways to eat these are with crackers and hot sauce or mustard."
2,not that thrilled,"I like these sardines and it seemed like a good deal so I ordered the box. Arrived a while ago. Two of the tins had broken open and everything is soaked in olive oil. I expect some kind of satisfaction from Amazon, have already sent an email inquiry. If they make good on it, I will edit the review to reflect the fact.I was promptly contacted by amazon by e-mail and offered a refund which I accepted."
2,Two Iconic Lead Characters Spend Half the Movie Apart In This Mash-Up That Plays It Too Safe,"From the ridiculous title alone, you'd have thought this classic would be unmissable for lovers of bad movie magic. Alas, and quite surprisingly, the movie lacks some of the lunacy and fun that you might expect. This south of the border epic introduces a renegade James and a maniacal Frankenstein (who is experimenting on poor locals), and then keeps them apart for much of the film's running time. Starting as a fairly routine western, the movie goes seriously off-course with one of the most annoying love stories that you're likely to encounter. A plucky Mexican heroine (who was scandalously killed in real life) whimpers and cringes throughout and yet remains an irresistible love interest for the rough riders. The final confrontations finally elicit viewer interest, but (for my taste) it is all rather tame and uninspired. The title shouldn't be the most interesting thing about your movie! KGHarris, 12/11."
2,Frankensteins Grand daughter hits an all time low !!!,"""Come into the library"" says Maria Frankenstein rather grandly to Jesse James and shows him into a room that does not contain one single book....Maria s laboritory is equally threadbare; A few flashing lights , a motor cycle helmet with a skull and crossbones painted on and an old hospital table. If you enjoy bottom of the barrel movies that you dont take too seriously then Jesse James meets Frankensteins Daughter could be for you. Like its companion piece ""Billy The Kid Verses Dracula"" made by the same team and probably on the same day make sure you have a few drinks before watching it."
1,Shame on Amazon!!!,"This movie does not star Terence Hill, Nancy Morgan or Ron Carey. I thought you were going to correct this Amazon!!!"
2,Grizzly Jigsaw,"La canteadora Grizzly que compre asi como venia ensamblada de fabrica tenia problemas de precision en el corte, es decir que no realizaba cortes de 90 grados. Es de esperar que una herramienta de fabrica venga perfectamente calibrada. Es cierto que la base se puede ajustar para lograr el corte recto, sin embargo, una herramienta nueva de fabrica debe hacer los cortes de forma correcta. Una vez que se ajusta el angulo de corte la canteadora funciona bastante bien.Thanks Grizzly, great support team...gracias..."
2,Grizzly,blade changing is tough on the one i recieved. saw seems to work ok. When i got my catalog i was excited to find a source on woodworking tools that were resonably priced. I now wish i had returned the jigsaw for a refund and saved up for higher end unitsuch as a milwalkee or porter cable. I will probally get a new one soon any way and just chaulk thethis purchase up as a lesson on -- you get what you pay for--
5,lacy lovely literate,"This delicately written account of a lovely woman trapped in her awful marriage, is one of the best i've read in years. I found it a subtle satire on the movie business of Fem Jep (female in jeopardy) as well... My book club found it, and it has been a stimulating choice!"
5,"Whiteout with wonder, skewers media and Adirondack resort","I lost count of the white images in this unique and clever novel. White for snow, white for brides, white for roses.This was not what I expected but I liked it a great deal more than if it had been standard kind of scared woman alone at a frozen lake. It is actually a smart take onthe movie business of 'scared women alone' at lakes & an elegant portrait of summer town in its off season.Highly recommended."
5,Chill out with brilliance,"Read this on a hot hot night and it cooled me off better than central ac. Chilling tale of loving wife, abusive hubby and exquisite snowbound setting...She's a movie star, and now maybe more than one man is after her. Very suspenseful, satisfying."
5,Laura is the face in a misty night,"I'm a big Laura fan --Laura the original movie and this Laura, the author of so many divergent works. Here, my favorite author displays her haunting side, with the same intensity & dazzling prose that marks her other ""greatest hits."" Don't miss this saga of the troubled actress and her mysterious marriage. Kept me up two nights in a row!"
3,Very Heavy,When I picked this car seat out I was very excited because it held more weight. When I carried it around the store it was not so heavy so I figured no brainer it will last us a while and it matches our stroller. Well when our baby was born I soon found out this car seat is very heavy and hard to get in and out of our SUV with our 11 lb baby in it.So if you are looking for a car seat that is easy to lug around this is not the one. On the flip side it is very nice looking and will last us a while.
5,GREAT PURCHASE,I highly recomend this carseat it is light enough for me to carry and it looks great.. my baby seems more confortable in it than in her crib.. i let her take naps in the carseat>.
5,Great carseat,I bought the graco safeseat when my daughter was 5 months old do to the fact that she grew out of her graco snugride before she could sit up. I was worried about getting her a convertable carseat because it would be hard to take her shopping. This product is pretty new and I found it interesting that it holds infants in a rearfacing position until they are 30lbs. and 1 year.(recommended)Plus it's a carrier. My childs safety is important as well as her comfort. This carseat has it all. I would recommend getting one of these carseats in the first place so you won't have the trouble of switching if you need to. I have 4 children and I never had this problem before. It could save you money in the long run. I love this carseat. FYI this carseat comes in different colors so if you don't like the ones babiesrus carries then try some other retailers. Mine is brown tan and blue gingum.
1,Awful book,"My wife and I both really hate this book. When our son picks it out for a bedtime story we usually try to convince him to pick something else. It is really long and the story is very strange. The vehicles are in some strange state of semiconsciousness and it is unclear whether the humans in the story are aware of this. There is a lot of completely unnecessary detail, and the vocabulary in the book is too advanced for young children. Having said all that, my son (4) likes it. But if you are going to be reading it to your kids, pick something else."
3,"very thin, mostly familiar yoga postures","There are two very enthusiastic reviews below this one, and I don't disagree with them. But buyer beware: this is a very, very skimpy book. Once you count in the chapter-title pages, and the half pages that begin and end each chapter, there are just not many words to read.In addition, most of the novelty content, such as it is, stems from the marriage of some very familiar yoga postures with Buddhist tonglen meditation. Don't buy this book if you think it has a wealth of information on some interesting ""Tibetan"" asanas. There is not much of that at all here.However, however. I am convinced that if you follow this book carefully, you will achieve great results. This will likely be caused more by the tonglen breathing than by the postures described.Namaste."
4,Enlightening!,"This book is WONDERFUL. As others have mentioned, the illustrations and explanations of the postures sometimes seem a little light, but it is an amazing book! I have practiced yoga for several years and recently learned about tong-len; to see them so effortlessly merged in this practice seems perfect!! I did find a DVD with the same title (also by Geshe Michael Roach ) at the following link: [...]. I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD yet, but am hopeful it will shed more light on the physical postures. Even without ""perfect"" asanas, though, I believe that this ""mindful"" yoga will do much to bring peace and harmony to those who practice it. As westerners, we often get very caught up in the physical side of yoga; this book helps explain why it's important to delve deeper."
4,Very small book and less pictures,"For those do want to buy it:It is very basic stuff but deal with Buddhism and yoga.For Buddhism followers, you should buy it if you like yoga and Buddhism.I think the writer took time writing about 114 pages.A small book and simple to understand.For those don't want to buy it:Small, less information.Religious and yoga, hard to learn, go and take a class on yoga, if you want to learn yoga.Not worth your money!!!Don't buy it instead!!!Unless you want to buy it and practice basic yoga and Buddhism!!!"
3,Great book,Bought this book as a gift because I had read it and loved it! A great choice for the families on our Christmas list.
4,For beginners!,"I am a beginner, so I am glad I purchased this video. Although I should be thankful for the amount of time spent on instruction, I was instead disappointed that I didn't feel I 'worked out' much. Attention was given more to quality rather than quantity, which was great, but I didn't feel like I did much after the run of the tape. After using this tape to master the Pilates moves, I will feel confident in purchasing another tape for more of a work out."
5,Essential Persuasion Techniques For Sales,"As a sales professional, this has long been one of my favorite books on how to persuade effectively.Kevin Hogan offers ten specific topics for detailed discussion, and then he offers concrete real-world examples for each one of them.When I read in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that this was one of the few allowed books in the common area library at Goldman Sachs, I was reminded to pick it back up and read through it again.Now I have another page and a half of ideas to implement that will help me be a more effective sales pro."
3,A mimic,"This book is good, but EVERYTHING here is taken from Robert B. Cialdini ""Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion"".My opinion is: buy the latter."
5,Excellent Book/Author,"I read a lot of sales/persuasion books. This is truely a good book by a Knowledgeable person. This is a combination of traditional sales info plus the book THE PSYCHOLOGY OF INFLUENCE, with a little NLP thrown in."
4,A book that will change your life,"I must tell you that it's one of the most amazing books that I've ever read. I will smile and say 'WoW' while reading this book. Though I haven't finished reading it completely, I'm sure that my life will get changed afterwards"
3,persuaded ?,"Im not sure how much is lost in the translation but I bought the tapes. I drive 90mins. daily and audio works best. the tapes seem to spend over half of the presentation selling the presentation and persuading me how great this revelation is. I think that I got about 50 mins of hands on valuable , repeatable or building block materials to make me a better persuader.He went on and on about how clever persuaders used the methods like Bill Clinton or Saddam Husien, Paul the Apostle or even Ghandi...they were intruiging examples.The 50 mins. that he did give up was a GREAT 50 mins. !"
5,A must for any sales professional...!!!,"As a sale professional for the past ten years I can tell you this, you will not a by another book that will add more to your income then this one. This book is the best book on persuasion period. If you are in sales or marketing, get this book. Kevin takes you through strategies you can begin to apply from day one.... After reading and applying this material, you will inprove your sales!"
5,Improve Your WHOLE Life!,"I started reading Kevin Hogan to improve my work life, but ironically my WHOLE life got better. That's because Dr. Hogan is unique in his approach. Though he never uses the hackneyed phrase ""holistic"", he does change the whole person with his approach. Because his methods work EVERYWHERE...and because they are not manipulative in the usual sense, they are true win-win solutions! This book will make your life better! Kevin Hogan teaches the real secret to a happier life. Its that simple."
2,Mistitled,"The title should be ""The Techniques of Persuasive Selling - How to Persuade People to Buy What You Sell."" ""Psychology"" is advertised in the title, but it's sizzle with no steak. The ""techniqes"" are standard selling stuff. It's a quick read."
1,Not very persuasive...,"The author definitely made some interesting points; however, I found myself skipping sentences and then paragraphs and finally, pages. The only ""evidence"" that Hogan provided in order to support his arguments (throughout the entire book) were simulated dialogues between an imaginary person and a Master Persuader. The dialogues, however, were poor. They were not realistic or informative. The best part of the book is Hogan's consistent references to other books, which end up composing a great list of must-reads. A good alternative is Robert Cialdini's ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion."""
2,RELIGULOUS,"I bought this book after reading a lot of the reviews, but no one mentioned how much religion is in this book. I was looking for a book based on real science, but its hard to tear out the valuable lessons from all the religous references. I'm going to barrel on through this book anyway, but readers should be aware that this book should be classified under religion or religious motivational speaking rather than psychology. A real disappointment."
1,The Complete Dean Martin [Box Set],"This box set has a great amount of songs and is a good deal for the price, but the audio sounds horrible. The album sounds like an old radio show, which isn't bad, but if you are looking for good sounding Dean songs, don't get this box set. Find something else, because the audio quality on this box set is horrible."
1,Not So Good Dino,"Don't let the long list of great songs fool you. This box set is cheap for a reason. You get what you pay for. alomst all of the songs are live proformances and the audio is terrible. If you can imagine Dean singing these songs live on an old radio, then you threw the radio down a well, you can get a good idea of what the audio is like. I certainly would not recommend anyone buying this unless they are looking for old live preformances of Dean Martin that sound like they're on Vinyls instead of CDs."
3,Dino's great! Audio's not so hot.,"Dean Martin is wonderful as always, and there are some really good, rare songs, but the audio isn't all that spectacular. It has a scratchy old radio sound to it. If you're a big Dino fan, it's a nice set to have, but don't expect great quality."
3,It is not the R version,"I am a Pernell Roberts fan and always wanted to see the ""R"" version of this movie--supposedly there is a racy bath scene. Well, this isn't the ""R"" version--very tame. Not only that but the color has been enhanced and tends to look gaudy. But you do get to see Pernell Roberts and although it's a silly movie, he is, in my opinion, worth watching."
2,"over priced, but what can you do","The book is for course work, so what can you?! At $100 for prime customers it's still a rip off. How about they get the thing in paperback and make the cost more reasonable for students. In terms of content, I like the fact that the subject matter is reviewed at the end of chapters and every safefy system out there is covered."
4,Good overview of techniques,"This is an excellent overview of a large number of techniques for safety analysis. The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is that the author is a bit imprecise in his use of terms event and condition and is a bit repetitive in the first 3 chapters. However, as a desk reference it is excellent and it gives strong guidance as to the steps necessary for a good safety process. It aligns well with my Harmony(r) process for real-time development (see my booksReal-Time Agility: The Harmony/ESW Method for Real-Time and Embedded Systems Development,Real Time UML: Advances in the UML for Real-Time Systems (3rd Edition),Real Time UML Workshop for Embedded Systems (Embedded Technology)andDoing Hard Time: Developing Real-Time Systems with UML, Objects, Frameworks, and Patterns, if you're interested)."
2,Beginners only!,"This book was advertised as having a reader level from beginner to advanced; although it was thoughtful and well laid out, it is for beginners only. The author manages no more with 900+ pages then what FileMaker does in roughly 200 pages with their boxed manual.If your thinking about making this purchase, reread the manuals that came with FileMaker and spend your money on something useful. I was hoping for a lot more."
3,Plugins?,It says there's a whole chapter on plugins but I only find one plugin covered in depth and that one BRIEFLY. Hmph. I'll look elsewhere.
1,Lame Book,Don't buy this; the tool stinks and book doesn't provide very good example. FMPro is a badly written piece of software.
5,"""Old Florida"" with a side of humor",I loved Al Burt's newspaper columns because he wrote about a Florida that only someone who got there before 1975 would even recognize. They are even more fun to read now. Makes me want to hop in the car and drive to Micanopy!
3,okay,"Never heard of burt before. I am sure if you are a fan this is a good book. He is a great writer and the stories are really nice.I bought it thinking it was a bit of florida history, but it was a meandering of stories from individuals that lived in florida. A little hard to tell the timelines in some of the stories until you see the end of the story and the date, but interesting stories nonetheless.As a history book, a big zero. As a folk tale book, a good 5.Depends what you are looking for.For me it was a diversion from intense history I usually read. As a former conch and a native it is neat to see some stories in that realm."
5,Florida Crackers & Managed Growth,"I recently retired to Florida, and was intriqued with the interviews with real ""Florida Crackers"", and life in the early 20th century (survival without air conditioning!). Entertaining AND Informative.The latter part of the book's focus on John DeGrove, Florida's ""father of managed growth"" is particularly interesting. Although written in the mid-90's, the history and background is even more valuable in 2012, given the current issues of Lake Okechobee, the Everglades, ""Big Sugar"", and the Treasure Coast, where I live. Should be required reading for all those in both the private and public sectors, who are in a position to determine Florida's future."
5,Florida history,"As with my other review of Burt's material he has done a good job of presenting Florida to the non native (Florida Cracker). My family has been in Florida for generations as cattle producers which provided beef for troops during the American revolution, so I appreciate someone preserving the history."
5,A fresh and engaging vision -- of hope and promise,"There is no more readable and fascinating book on the future of American politics than ""A Reason To Vote."" I was shocked, moved, thrilled, saddened, and ultimately, left with a wonderful sense of hope as I read through this book. The author's engaging and personal style drew me in and made me feel that I had actually participated in the events and met the people he describes in his account of the problems with our political system and the hope for change. I would recommend it to anyone who is concerned, interested, involved, or even just wondering about how our American political system could regain its moral integrity and higher purpose."
3,A Good Look At The NLP,"For anyone interested in third party politics, this book offers a good snapshot of the Natural Law Party, which, along with the Libertarian, Reform, and Constitution parties stands as one of the ""major minors"" -- often on the ballot, with a fairly professional operation. That said, much of the book drags, as Roth preaches about NLP views on several issues at great length, and gives short shrift to the party's actual plans for future electoral action. Perhaps silliest -- though most telling about what a minor party must face -- is a lengthy section about the creation and publicity of just one press release."
1,A perfect opportunity to experience Hell,"If you love sickness, death, darkness and decomposition, then you MUST have this CD. I bought it because so many people recommended it to me. As with nearly all of Schnittke's music, I felt so bad after listening to it that it took me a week or so of intensive Mozart, Bach and Faure therapy to recover. It literally feels as if you've been gobbled up by a black cloud.I have no doubt that Schnittke exposes some very brilliant musical ideas here. But to what end? And at the end of the day, who cares if it's a masterpiece by the Devil, if its effect on you is a lucid experience of Hell and stains of de-composition and decay?"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Do yourself a favor and give five bucks to a worthy cause instead of fattening the wallet of this clown.--USC Grad
1,Poor Writer,"I really wanted to like this book, but plain and simple- it is terrible. The author's writing and thought process are like a two year olds. The only funny thing is that this author failed high school."
1,The worst thing ever put on paper,I am but a simple minded 14 year old but I love Notre Dame. This book is a shameful effort to take away some of the glory of Notre Dame. I have read some of the other reviews for this book and a USC graduate didn't even like this book! The lowest you are allowed to rate this book is 1 star but it should be a negative eleven. Eleven for how many National Championships Notre Dame has won in football.
2,Save your money.,"I admit I don't like Notre Dame. It's a good school with many good students. I still don't like it. That does not mean that I would encourage anyone to buy any of these generally mean-spirited and under-researched books. Sure it's supposed to be a joke, but it is a cheap and nasty laugh. If you really think you or yours are better than any of the things this author hates, then prove it. Don't buy these books."
1,this author is a crack addict,"there is one thing to say about this book, and that is that the only reason it was written is out of jealousy. admit it, the people who hate notre dame are only jealous of its excellence."
1,FineBUM is scum and has no brain,Don't buy this guy's stupid books and don't listen to his radio show. He is a parasite that feeds off of the stupidity of the unwashed public. A chrome dome pooper scooper.
1,This book is obnoxious.,"Why would anyone publish ""hate"" books? I also can't imagine one about the University of Notre Dame. Virtually everyone that goes there loves it, and hardly no one ever leaves. To write a book of this nature is ridiculous."
4,"It lifts 300 pounds for me, even if rated below","Definitely worth the price,There is a max weight indication engraved, 45kg = 100 pounds, but I use them lifting 300 pounds, no problem.Plus sideStrong, solid thick metal built.minusno ball bearingworks better when you put some axle grease in therethere is some space on the sides of the wheel, my steal cable can fall in that crease - not a serious problem.well worth the money."
5,10 Things I hate about you. Even better than the movie!!!,"This is an awesome tv show... Even better than the movie! It takes you back to your high school days, even though I would never want to actually relive them."
1,More like sewing thread than hemp ...,"While the shipping was timely , the product itself is lacking . I suppose I should have gotten a clue from the low price . There's no way to tell from the picture , that this so called ""hemp"" seems to be nothing more than bright yellow sewing thread , and does not have the sturdiness and thickness of hemp routinely used in piping . I would not order this product again ."
5,About THE PRESIDENCY OF GERALD R. FORD,"This book is a well-researched and thought provoking book. It is the best book on a bad subject. The author obviously knows what he is talking about, sometimes to the detriment of the reader. Very in-depth. This is NOT the place to start for a study of Gerald Ford. It may be the place to end."
3,The Great American Government Set Up..,"That is what the title of this book should have been called.America is the greatest country in the world and I am a proud American. However, I am not too proud of the government that orchestrated this fiasco.What a waste of American Tax payers dollars! I highly recommend that you read ""Con Man or Saint?"", ""Turner, Turner, Turner: The King of Network Marketing"" and especially ""The Unstoppable American"", if you can still get a copy."
2,Very Limited Use,"This product allows you to create specific projects featuring the Little Mermaid characters. However, it is very limited. You cannot manipulate the images, change their size, etc. I guess it is fine if your child wants to create name tags or placemats but if you're looking to customize anything this program won't allow it. I would not purchase this again."
1,Useless bloatware except for Ghost 9,"I purchased this, installed it, and after hours of struggling with compatability issues, have uninstalled everything except for Ghost 9 (which is a significant upgrade from Ghost 2003, because Symantec bought out another company's better drive imaging product and gave it their own brand). Luckily the price after rebates on Systemworks is about the same as for Ghost alone. Antivirus 2005 has all the problems reported for 2004, compatability problems with other programs and it slows your system down significantly. I have switched to Vcom's Fix-It Utilities (better than Norton Utilities) and plan on buying Trend Micro's PC-cillin to replace the antivirus bundled with Fix-It Utilities.Another customer lost by Symantec..."
1,Useless except for Ghost 9,"Ghost 9 is a significant upgrade, but the remaining componenets have compatibility and performance problems, I unistalled them and swirched to Fix-It and Pc-cillin antivirus."
2,Norton Systemworks 2006,The product is laided with protection for Symantec. Customer service is very poor. I upgraded my P4 with an AMD 64 to get away from heating problems of a poorly designed motherboard. When I reinstalled Systemworks 2006 it changed my date by a year earlier. When I corrected the date the computer the software stop working because it was expired after only 2 months. It took a week for free e-mail support to respond and they were not very helpful. They want to protect themselves from piracy but yet make a very complex system with virtually no support. Hey guys there has to be a better way!!!! $29.95 to correct Symantec problems is too high of price to pay!!!
2,"Slows down your computer like crazy. For AV, use NOD32 instead","I've not much opinion about most of NSW, but I do have to say that I've used both NSW 2003 and 2005, with each clobbering my system nearly outright.My systems: Win XP Pro SP2 / 3.0 Ghz P4 / 800 Mhz FSBWhen I switched to NOD32 all the slowness vanished. As a software engineer for 20 years, I am well aware of how programs can bloat.And this one is an unbelievable dog."
2,2005 Better than 2004 - Installation Nightmare - Beware,"Nastiest program install I've ever had; exceeding the difficulty of the 2004 install. Autoprotect did not work. Uninstalled and reinstalled the program 5 times, deleted files on the hard drive; and (perspiration) hacked the registry all at the direction of Symantec's online help directives. 4 hours later, finally got the program to install correctly. 2005 was an upgrade from SystemWorks 2004.Symantec lost my business on my laptop last year. Unless there are glowing reviews for future versions of this product, they've lost it on my desktop too.Agree with the other reviewers; this product is not for the average PC user; once you have it installed, it does take less resources; and it's a shame a fine product is brought to shambles by installation nightmares; as I too am a long time Norton user since back in the DOS days..., however, two years of nasty upgrade installation problems... bye Norton... aka Symantec."
2,"Useless ""Customer Service""; Many Wasted Hours","Man, do I wish I had read reviews before switching from SystemWorks 2002 to 2005. It was recommended to me by a family member to purchase the software rather than just subscribing for updates... BIG mistake.Before I had a perfectly working GoBack. Now it won't even install (since I had to uninstall the old version to install the new one). Guess I'm relying on system restore now.The Antivirus installed... after quite a bit of time. But at least that is working, which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. But I definitely DO NOT recommend the product. Subscribe for the updates if you have an older version or get something else entirely. Trust me. It's not worth the headache. And their web customer service doesn't provide any useful insight. I refuse to pay another $30 to talk to the phone support."
1,WORTHLESS,"I have been using their products for many years, but this year's edition simply does not install. I have wasted hours trying to get this to work. The solutions in their knowledge base are ineffective. It's the weekend, so of course there's no technical support -- even when there is -- there is a charge of $30. Save your time and money -- buy something else."
1,Abysmal Tech Support -- Do Not Buy!!!,"WORST customer service experience I have ever had in my life. Not only did installation of their supposed upgrade (to NSW 2005 from 2004) severely damage my operating system (MS-xp_pro), but Norton refused responsibility and tried to palm me off on Microsoft Fee-Based Tech Support. After countless hours on the phone with Microsoft, we identified the problem squarely at Norton. I then had to fight for 3 days with Norton Fee-based Customer Service even to get a troubleshooter on the phone, who then led me through a wild goose chase of useless fixes. (This after being lied to for three days about the reasons for the delays -- that they were supposedly researching my issue.) If you already made the mistake of dealing with this despicable company, demand your money back!"
1,Norton SystemWorks 2005 Premier,"This is the product that pushed me over the edge, I will never buy a Norton product ever again. After a half dozen failed attempts to install this on my laptop, I decided to install on my desktop instead. Now I can't activate it because it thinks it is installed on my laptop. Its not like I am a beginner either, I have been doing computer maintenance for over 25 years. In the last five or six years my experiences with Norton products have been progressively worse, they won't install properly, you can't uninstall them, they want to ""take control"" of your computer (it will never work the same after you install their junk). A total and complete waste of my money!!!"
3,unhappy with works,"If this was only about performance i would have to give a 5 star rating. But this is not about performance. I bought my norton sys.works a little over a year ago. recently i bought a new computer when i went to install sys.works on it it said it had been installed on too many computers. Told me to send in my copy of norton along w/serial# and the receipt from where i purchased it. now its been over a year, now if some of you guys out there deep receipts like this over a year, then maybe its just me, buts but the amount it cost me for the software i expect it to be mine. But now because i don't have a receipt they are taking it back"
1,Worst book ever,"I know its free and it is for your kindle. But don't waster your time getting this junk. It sucks and I hate it and I wish that it wasn't there at all. For me, when I bought it, my kindle crashed and I had to get another one. 1 out of 3 of these have spyware or a bug. DON'T GET IT PLEASE"
3,"Good instruction, poor production","The instruction and the exercises presented in this video were of an excellent calibur. However, the poor production quality and, I hate to say it, incredibly annoying music score, took away from the overall presentation. That said, if you are looking for a good, easy to follow workout using an excercise ball this tape can deliver in that aspect."
1,I'm returning this video,"This video is very calming and slow paced, so if that's what you're looking for, then buy it. I wanted total concentration on a really hard ab workout for the exercise ball and this woman is just too slow for me."
1,LET DOWN JANUARY 2003,THIS VIDEO IS NOT WHAT THE TITLE SAYS I THINK IT IS VERY HARD TO FOLLOW BECAUSE JUST AS YOU GET THE MOVEMENT GOING LIZ CHANGES MOVEMENT WHICH BECOMES VERY FRUSTRATING THE SETS ARE TOO SHORT TO FOLLOW TO GET GOING AND THE KNEE LIFTS WHILE YOU ARE LEANING ON THE SIDE OF THE BALL ARE VERY HARD ON THE KNEE & HIP JOINTS.I ALSO PURCHASED THE FAT BURNING BIG BALL WORKOUT AND FEEL THE SAME ABOUT THAT ONE PILATES AND BIG BALL DO NOT MIX LIZ CHANGES MOVEMENTS TOO SOON JUST AS YOU GET BALANCED YOUR CHANGING POSITION AGAIN.I ALSO WOULD NOT CALL IT A FULL WORKOUT
1,Doesn't work in DVD Player,"I purchased this for my husband to use to learn more about digital recording and mixing. I did not know until after he tried to play it that it requires a PC and Quicktime. My husband is not computer savvy and even though I installed Quicktime on my computer we had issues with the video freezing, etc. even though I am computer savvy. He is frustrated that he cannot use it without a computer. Wish I'd known that before purchasing as this will just collect dust."
3,Tangine,I was disappointed when I received it becoz altho the description reads that it can go in the oven its not recommended. I know traditionally tangines are used on a stove or open fire but I expected to use it in the oven as described. I have used it on a number of occasions and the food turns out wonderfully. I also have a non-metal tangine but prefer this one becoz of the easy cleanup of the non-stick surface.
4,Wow! cheesey stoner mess with your head stuff,"Yeah so the first time I found this in a friends attic, I was blown away. Its like pop video game classical techno Smashmouth stole a riff from here, and The beastie Boys stole the cover title and idea, but not nearly as wack-o as these dudes. All I have to say is like, wow, man..."
3,A unique collection of synthesized music!,"When I first heard this album over 20 years ago, I had never heard synthesized music before. In the years since I've not heard any other music like the selections on this album. I have been looking for the name of the last selection ""Visa to the stars"" ever since I heard it. Finally now, I can order and listen to a CD version of this album."
5,Way Out and Way Back!,"I remember seeing Kingsley and Perrey on ""The Mike Douglas Show"" in the 1960s, performing this music with an impish, professorial air.The vivid, cartoonish style made it a natural for local television kid shows. In Tulsa, it was used on ""Mr. Zing and Tuffy"" and ""Uncle Zeb's Cartoon Camp"".This CD will send you Way Out and Way Back!"
5,Just The Ticket,"Bought this for my mom as a gift and she loves it. Looks nice, small footprint, makes a nice cup of coffee, inexpensive."
3,COFFEE MAKER,"GOOD PRICE. THE SPACE FOR PUTTING WATER IN IS PRETTY SMALL. PRETTY SLOW, TOO, BUT DOES THE JOB."
1,Great if you like coffee that tastes like burned plastic.,"This coffeemaker has the same drawback of most one-cup coffeemakers. It is plastic inside and out, and when it heats up, it smells of burning plastic. On top of this, the coffee has a burned-plastic taste to it - which is never a good thing.If the possibility of plastic chemicals leaching into your coffee isn't enough to deter you, consider the slow brewing time. It takes longer to brew one cup of coffee than it takes me to boil water on a stove and make the coffee with a French press. I had hoped having a small automatic maker would make my life a little less hectic getting ready for work in the morning, but the long wait and plastic-tasting coffee end up being a waste of my time (and my money).I'm sticking to the French press."
1,cold cup of weak coffee,"I expected this machine to work much as my Black and Decker one-cup-at-a-time (which I loved and can't find anywhere!) but, alas, it did not. Instead it brews a weak, COLD cup of coffee -- takes forever too. I would not recommend this coffee maker."
1,RATING CHANGE,"[EDIT] Feb. 3, 2011I have been noticing the plastic taste. That cannot be a good thing.I really liked this at first, but I cannot ignore the plastic taste and continue to use it."
2,inexpensive but problematic,"I bought this unit to replace my Black and Decker brew-n-go, only because it had gotten old and I wanted to try something different.This unit is inexpensive, very compact and looks quite nice, but it has some problems:1. It takes it a long time to make the coffee2. The coffee, to my taste, is not very good3. It does not have an automatic shut off, which seems dangerous to me (the black-n-decker has an automatic shut off)4. The unit REALLY heats up when it makes the coffee, making me really wish it had an automatic shut off5. You cannot use a large size mug ... which is a problem for me, because I don't like small mugs.So, I tried it but I'm not planning on not using it. I wish there were more options for single-cup coffee makers that don't require pods. I'm going back to the Black and Decker or to using single-cup filters."
4,1 cup coffee maker,"This is fairly good quality for the cost. The only thing I would have liked to see is the cup being kept warm while it sits on it's base. There is not heat available, otherwise it is good."
2,Disappointed in this coffee maker,"The product details state that many size cups can be used for this machine. The only one that fits is the one that comes with the coffee maker. I also read that it comes with an extra base for larger mugs. It did not come with an extra base. The height of the mug can only be as high as the one included with the coffee maker. I purchased this thinking I would be able to use my ""favorite"" mug, but I can not."
2,Cheap and it shows,"This coffee maker seemed like a great idea. We bought it for my mother who lives alone and only drinks one or two cups of coffee in the morning. It was okay for exactly one month, then it stopped working, although it never did get the water boiling hot. I guess you really do get what you pay for. This product was very inexpensive, and it showed. It's a piece of junk, and we returned it."
1,Dreadful,"This product makes lukewarm water and produces weak, undrinkable coffee. When I say ""lukewarm"", I really mean that the liquid coming out of this machine is not even close to hot. Why bother? Ridiculous.Not expensive, but you get what you pay for. If you like a good cup of coffee, I advise you to ante up for a machine that will work. I am sending this one back and will be purchasing a REAL coffee maker.The lucky thing is that I bought this from Amazon, where they always make good on the things they sell. The return is painless, and they are even paying for the return shipping, so I am not out any money. However, the whole thing has been a waste of time, and now I have to make an extra trip to the post office."
4,Good but:,"I love it,I don't think it'd be hot enough for people who add milk. Flavors good. Glad I bought it (I drink black coffee and its ready to drink). It's i bit loud and it's not very fast (you can brew a 1/4 pot in regular cheapo coffee maker in about the same) But I live with a small kitchen and can afford much counter space. So for that 5 stars. Build quality 3 stars Value 5 stars"
2,ToastessTFC-326 review,"I would not recommend this coffeemaker. The coffee does not come out very hot. I read some other reviews and one suggested circulating the water for a minute and then flip the spigot over the grounds, but this takes forever. It is also very messy, I cover the gap with tinfoil."
2,Not so good,We needed a new one cup coffee maker. My husband drinks one cup a day. Our Black and Decker one finally gave up the ghost. Most of the reviews were favorable so thought we would try it. Pretty disappointed. It is very slow - takes forever to brew one cup and then it is pretty noisy in the final minutes. Think we will look for another brand.
1,"Slow, slow slow",It takes 7 full minutes for 1 lukewarm cup of coffee. It accomodates 1 size cup and there was no extra base as stated. I donated to the local thrift stote. At least I got a tax write off for it.
1,Piece of scrap,If I did have kept the box I would have return it right away...at first use...water is not hot... just warm...and there is drops of coffee all around the coffee maker...a real mess...don't touch this item!!!
3,Good coffee maker for the money.,"There is a trick to making hot coffee with this appliance. Leave the spout swung to the side (not over the filter) until the water is boiling hot, then carefully swing it over the filter. You will have boiling hot coffee!"
4,Suits the purpose.,"Quick and easy at a good price. I agree with some others that the coffee could be hotter, but for an afternoon cup, it's fine."
3,Okay for one cup but I've had better.,Not as good as my old Black & Decker Cup-at-a-Time. It takes longer to brew and the coffee isn't that hot. I also preffered the automatic shut-off.
2,Make weak coffee,It makes a weak cup of coffee. My guess is the water passes through the filter too quickly.What do you expect for $14.00 Other than that it works as advertised. Makes one cup quickly and takes up little room.
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR....,THE LID ON THE COFFEEMAKER KEEPS COMING OFF. THE HANDLE HOLDING DOWN THE FILTER IS AWKWARD. I SHOULD'VE PURCHASED THE BLACK AND DECKER COFFEE MAKER. IT IS A WELL MADE PRODUCT FOR THE SAME COST AND EASIER TO USE.
1,Much too small,This makes about a 1/2 a cup of coffee and without a warming plate you have to drink it immediately because it gets cold quickly. All of my other mugs were too big to fit in this thing. Waste of money as I had to buy a better/bigger coffee machine within a week of trying to get this thing to work.Save yourself the headache and some cash and get a machine that is slightly bigger with a warming plate/heated cup holder too!Do not recommend.
2,Wouldn't buy again.,"Yes, it's relatively cheap, but you get what you pay for. It's very black inside - my elderly dad had a hard seeing clearly enough the inside workings of the top part where you put the water and coffee in. Also, it has a little arm thingy that dispenses the hot water that you have to move out of the way to put the grounds in, and then, yhou have to remember to swing it back into place before you shut the top and turn it on, or it will not make coffee. You come back to get your nice hot cup, and duh! you forgot to swing the arm back. Drove my old dad crazy. Also, didn't make very hot coffee at all."
5,GREAT LITTLE COFFEEMAKER,I bought this for my 90 year old mother and she loves it. Very easy to use. Looks nice on the counter.
1,Stinks!!!!,"Bought this as a gift, didn't work from the start. In process of sending it back.The only reason 1 gave it 1 star was because I had to to rate it."
1,DO NOT BUY,We bought this to take on a trip as it was small and would provide that nice wake up cup in the morning. Well...it did --- one time. After the first cup it completely stopped working. I had to toss it and get another brand -- which worked.
2,"Splish, Splash!","Yes, it does splash, whether you use the supplied mug or your own. I've found that removing the hard rubber grommet in the hole where the liquid passes through to the mug lessens the splashing somewhat. And raising the mug also helps.I was looking for a replacement for my Black & Decker Cup-at-a-Time. The Toastess feels cheap in comparison, and the coffee is not as good nor as hot. And it's s-l-o-w.Well, I spoke too soon. Removing the grommet works okay, as long as you position the mug as far back as it can go. Otherwise, some of the coffee misses the mug. I'll go back to my Krups."
4,Perfect for work,"This Toastess coffeemaker fits my needs at work perfectly. It's tiny and bare-bones basic, but that's what I wanted, something cheap to keep at my desk and I don't have to share the office coffee pot. It comes with an 8 ounce mug, a 12 oz. mug fits underneath as well (you ARE limited to brewing a 10.5 ounce cup however). The coffee comes out at the perfect temperature, hot, but not hot enough to scald the roof of your mouth. I also use mine for instant soups and oatmeal.Two complaints. It's slow - I didn't time it but just guessing 3 to 4 minutes to get a cup of coffee. Also it tends to slide around when you're trying to switch it on/off, it needs some rubber feet.NOTE: Don't forget to remove the coffee scoop when you unbox it; I almost didn't notice it inside the water reservoir."
1,Worst cup o joe EVER,"I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased this machine from Amazon. However, all I am left with is a bad taste in my mouth. And I mean that literally! I don't even taste the coffee- I taste what I can only presume is burnt metal and electronics. I was used to a Black and Decker single cup coffee maker that worked diligently and very well for over 18 years! This one I have owned for about 2 months and it has simply performed very poorly. Don't waste your money on this very inferior product. If you are foolish enough to do so, watch out!"
2,Dissappointing Product!!,I'm sorry that I didn't look closer at the details of this product before ordering it. I'll list the problems I found with it:1) It takes a lot longer than it should to make a single cup2) It doesn't have an auto shut-off feature when completed3) The arm that pours the hot water over the grounds does not automatically mover to the proper location when you close the cover. poor design!!!There are much better ones online than this one for a similar price. Good Luck!
3,It is what it is...,I had a small apt with limited counter space so it did it's job. The coffee quality was unreliable but it did make coffee.
2,Only One Thing Wrong,"There is only one thing really wrong with this coffee maker and that is that it is MESSY! The water reservoir is too small to successfully pour a cup of water into with out spilling it all over the counter, and once you are finished mopping that up and actually turn it on, it splatters coffee all over the counter. The fact that you have to remember to turn it off doesn't bother me, but cleaning a quarter cup of water off the counter DOES."
4,1 cup coffee maker,I like it really well but takes a little long to brew a cup. Takes just as long as my Bunn does for a whole pot!!
4,Good coffee maker,I got this for my calculus teacher (we have a tri weekly class at 7:00 am during which she was always very sleepy) now she keeps it on her desk and uses it daily.
4,Great coffee maker for the price,"This 1 cup coffee maker is really great if you are a 1 cup coffee drinker. It also does a great job just brewing hot water for tea.If you want something small and affordable, this is what your loking for.over all rating I give it a 4 star."
3,okay for the price,"It makes coffee.Coffee seems a bit weak and not very hot, but convenient way to get a cup of joe in a small space."
2,JoNana,Does an OK job of making coffee and I like this it has a reuseable filter. BUT the coffee always has a faint plastic taste. Tried flushing with white vinegar and then vanilla but the weird plastic taste remains. It ruins a good cup of coffee. Also have to use more coffee to get it strong enough. I would not recommend this.
3,"Works fine, except---","Works fine, coffee is hot and good, no problem there. What I can't believe is that it does NOT shut off automatically when done brewing. I'm not sure what would happen if someone forgot about it for a few minutes. This is NOT SAFE at all and I will have to buy another unit, basically useless."
2,Opt For The Black And Decker Brew N Go,"When my old single server died of old age, I searched and found this Toastee and a Black and Decker both of which seemed to fulfill my requirements. As each was only about $15, I decided to get the two of them and let the better man win. Both lost points for not having a see-thru indicator to show the water level at 1 cup or 2 cups and I declared B&D the winner because the Toastee's brewing time is much longer. It also came with a piece of its plastic chipped off, but I'm sure that was a misfortune that can happen to any machine. As it didn't affect its working condition, I'm not taking that into consideration with the rating."
1,Broke in 2 weeks of use,I ordered this item and within first two weeks of using it it broke - just stopped working altogether. It is not worth the time and effort to mail it back. I'm just going to buy another brand. What a waste of 14 dollars.
1,save your money!,"I bought this coffeemaker in Dec. 2010 and it is now one month later and it does not work. I used it exactly 3 times with good results and then it just died on the 4th.try. It lights up and does nothing more, does not warm up, does not make coffee!My advice, do not buy this one---cheap is cheap!"
1,Poorly Written Guide,"This is probably the worst guide book I have ever owned, and I own a lot of guide books. I received it as a gift, and I wish I had gotten Lonely Planet, Let's Go, or Rough Guide; even Frommer's would be better. If all Moon Handbooks are this poor, I have no idea how they stay in business. It is poorly written--it reads like a seventh grader wrote it. The language is flowery rather than informative, and when the writers try to include cultural or historical information, they base it on hearsay or simply get bored with writing and leave the reader wondering what the real story is (their section on Garifuna history, for example, ends in 1832--surely the Garifuna have done something in the last 171 years). Do yourself a favor and buy a different guidebook."
3,Belize Handbook,"This handbook was concise and informative. I especially used the 2 maps of San Pedro, Ambergris Caye. I couldn't have found my way around without it--especially since there were limited signs and directions in San Pedro.I also found the recommendations helpful for restaurants and sites. I was the only one in my group with a book and everyone relied on me for the maps and information.Overall, the size of the book fit nicely in my purse. I've carried it with me on 3 trips to Belize and my trips were better because of it!"
3,Great product but not for windows 7,"I had an earlier version of the Bible library that I liked very much. I recently got a new laptop with windows 7 as the operating system. The old program would not load onto the machine so I bought a newer version. It will not work with 7 either. I tried to contact customer support but so far no help from them. The Bible Library works great. You can go from book to book easy and you just click on the verses. It has very good referance books that are easy to use,but not if you have windows 7."
3,its okay,"this is not the product i was looking for. this Bible library is very simple to use and would be good for someone needing basic information on their computer. if you want a tool for advance study, pass by this one."
2,this item is hard to use,"I specifically purchased this product so I could compare translations and versions of the same verse. I was hoping for something similar to a parallel Bible. Unfortunately, I had an incredibly hard time trying to figure out how to get different versions to show up. It just doesn't work."
5,Works great on windows vista home basic,I really like this in case I can't keep the internet I will still have a digital bible.
5,I love it! i hope season 1 has this many extras!,Although i was sadden by the Change eps. I didnt like them bcuz they where to sad! I did like the 16 cartoons of Punky Brewster this 4dvd set this box set offers!Me and my daughter loved the cartoons!I love the artwork and how the case opens! it has 21 eps! i got it for 25 dollars! not bad concerning i piad 50 for a newer show with the same amount of eps! Love it love it love it buy it buy it buy it lol
5,Definitely buy this!,"I will be getting married in December 2010, but since it will be a small wedding, we didn't have the option of hiring musicians. When I saw this CD, I noticed that it included songs I was looking for. Once I received it, I was thrilled that this exceeded my expectations. If you're looking for beautiful music, this CD should be considered."
4,A nice CD,"This is a nice CD. It has songs for the wedding ceremonyThe music it is very relaxing.We also enjoyed theNew Wedding Traditions Volume I CD because it has the father/bride , groom/ mom, and other wedding songs that are perfect for the reception.Amazon is such a big help for planning a wedding.Thanks"
3,Drum and Toner,"I recieved the drum and toner a day late. It came in good condition as advertised, but the toner that came in the package came empty!"
5,Okidata drum with toner,Always a good product and lasts a long time. We are very pleased and will reorder other colors as needed.
2,Is He Serious?,"I couldn't tell whether Mr. Vincent wrote this book tongue in cheek or if he was serious. If it was tongue in cheek, then it was a very funny book and a real look at goombas who want to think they're players. If he was serious - wow! This is wild."
5,Perfect for girls who love a Man's Man,"I've hated every character this guy has played but he sure writes a terrific book. Funny, sarcastic, informative . . . if your boy or man is a slob, a hippie, a beatnik, or any of the above, get him this book. He'll be whipped into shape in no time. And you will be writing Frank Vincent 'thank you' cards, believe me."
5,A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man,"A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man was a very good read. Frank Vincent has a very interesting take on life. The book has some good tip regarding cigars, wine and other tidbits that most guys like myself overlook. It is also good to read a book written by an actor/celebrity that contains no discussion of any type of politics or political beliefs. I wish I had an autographed copy of the book.CharliePont"
3,If you have $100K burning a hole in your pocket Frank tells you exaclty what to do with it.,"A quick read book with a great list of songs, drinks, food, and places to stay in Vegas. Only if you have the cash to burn to purchase all the man's man accessories and dinners that Frank speaks of. Besides all the items to buy Frank does give excellent advice on how to dress and how to groom yourself. Which is a lost art and should be reinstated for most. Also the excellent interviews with other men's men were an inside look that most of us will never see.3 stars only because it costs way too much to be a man's man!"
5,frank vincent,great seller got the item within 2 weeks delivered to australia didnt expect it so soon as amazon usually is a month so great job guys happy with product
1,Dreadful,"I'm not sure I've had the misfortune to read a more dreadful book. How to shave...how to smoke a cigar...what was the author thinking? An obvious effort to cash in on the Soprano's popularity. I'm going to guess that Frank Vincent is an engaging, talented, interesting individual with some terrific personal experiences. Unfortunately very little of Mr. Vincent's personality comes through in his book (at least I HOPE this is not the sum total of his personality). If you can't overcome your curiosity, buy this one used."
5,LOVED this book!!!!,"I bought this book as a gift for my husband. He is a macho type. Anyway, he LOVED the book and well so did I. We love visiting Vegas and it gave alot of great suggestions of what to do, see and experience.I also really liked the How to Dress like a Man's Man section. It spoke about how a guy should dress. My husband usually looks nice but sometimes he likes to dress in sweats, so this was a perfect way to remind him to dress nice, Haha!The section on making cocktails was great too! Spoke about how to mix the drinks and everything was great, very cool for when we have friends over. I was quite shocked that even though this is a Mans book that I found myself reading it, but I guess most of us woman want to know how men really think!!!I would highly suggest purchasing this book. For the price it is packed with such great info and it is funny too!Get it especially before returning to Vegas!!!! LOVED IT!!!"
1,A Guy's Guide to being a Laughable Charicature,"Have you ever wished you could drop several thousand dollars on fancy clothes your friends will probably laugh at you for wearing? Ever wished you were that well-dressed prick who just struck out with his waitress? Does your mind not rebel at the thought of any normal person ordering a ""dirty martini straight up shaken not stirred with a twist and three olives"" at the bar?Basically, this book amounts to plugging a lot of crap you don't need and trying to convince that it's manly to get a manicure and act like a cheap goombah. Before I read this book I would have thought it's okay for a man to wear jeans and a shirt to a bar and order a beer. Thanks Frank.Also, I'm a big fan of The Sopranos, but Frank spends way too much time licking James Gandolfini's patent leather shoes. It's disgusting, I almost threw up all over the book!"
3,blackhawk level3 serpa,"This holster is a very, very low Level 3.I also, wish I knew it was a low rider holster too."
5,Blackhawk SERPA Level 3,"This is the best holster I've used so far! It's a level 3, so it's extremely secure, but the auto release buttons make it very easy to release when needed. All my co-workers are buying it now."
1,Knights Feeble,"A dull and uninformative effort with low production values, utilizing two talking heads with the same limited graphics and music in mind numbing repetition for two hours! A poorly written documentary that jerks without explanation from one period to another, shows buildings without explanation of what they are and where, and even abruptly introduces Salidin without explanation of who he was and where he came from. The Knights Templar story is a fascinating one which has lead to some fevered speculations about their secrets, treasures, and religious icons, including the Holy Grail. So excess regarding the Templars has usually been the problem -- but this thing has suceeded in reducing the story to something that would bore a ten year old. Not worth buying at any price."
1,The Knights Templar,"I found the documentary a bit repetitive with its scences. It looks to have been made with a very low budget. So much more could have been said about the history of a very influencial order that changed many of the rules of warfare and even trade during the 13th and 14th Century and have given rise to a lot of speculation as to their connection with Masons, Rosicrucians and other secret organizations. The two ""experts"" did a credible job in their explanations and the photography, particularly that in the deserts was very good but as far as historical information, it left a lot out."
4,Interesting Two Hour Historical Documentary.,"This is a four part TV documentary from 2000 totaling 120 minutes, and is stereophonic, but unfortunately does not contain sub-titles/closed captions. Prof. Malcolm Barber who is the world's leading expert on the Templar's explains the history of this group of medieval knights who were renowned for protecting Christain Holy Sites in the Palestine area of the Middle East. The historical aspects are very well done with some mini recreations of the knights life-styles, but the mythological aspects of the knights alleged posession of the Holy Grail and other items pertaining to Christ and his family, seem to me to be glossed over. Overall this is a good introduction to the Knights Templar which should be followed up by reading the series of books by Micheal Baigent & Richard Leigh."
4,A good CD for your Hoyt Axton collection,"Because this is a double album on one CD, its a good bargain. Della and The Dealer in on this one, but my favorite song on these two albums is The House Song."
4,||,"A somewhat allegoric story about a boy (who is the only character not to be mentioned by name) growing up in a remote mountain village. He lives away from his parents, with his grandfather and the extended family. His views of the world run contrary to the reality that he sees and therefore he perishes. His death is very dramatic, since he believes in the old legend of a mother-deer, in the existence of a white ship and in turning into a fish.The story is a rebellion against various forms of human vices, many of which are explored here."
1,Unacceptable adaptation,"I've seen other BBC episodes of Lynley & Havers and enjoyed them, but this one was a terrible disappointment!I don't mind that they cast a tiny, pixie-ish, soft-spoken girl to play the overweight, dowdy, unattractive Havers. I love Nathaniel Parker as Lynley (I love him period). It doesn't bother me too much that the BBC's Simon appears more emotionally than physically disabled. I don't mind the fact that they have to play with the plot a little to fit it into a 2-hour program. But what I can't stand is that they changed the ending COMPLETELY! A hero becomes a villain. Other incidents make absolutely no sense in retrospect, when they would have if they'd kept George's original ending.Why'd they do this?? The other episodes I've watched kept true to the original endings."
5,I am a fan!,I had watched the series on TV but had missed the pilot.I never knew that there was so much murder and mayhem inLondon and the English countryside.
5,Lynley begins,"This was the first of the Inspector Lynley series, now unfortunately discontinued. Most of the elements of the series are present, and for those who missed out on the beginnings, here they are. For those unfamiliar with the story, it's all about a blue-blood inspector paired with a working-class sergeant. Comes off very well. The British seem to have a flair for this sort of thing."
3,Not as good as the book,"I love all the Inspector Lynley books, and really looked forward to getting this DVD. However, I found it so disappointing that I did not even finish it. The Lynley character did not look like he was described in the books, and Havers was far too pretty. So I just could not get into it. Also, the likeableness of Lynley in the novels was entirely absent from the DVD - I did not like the character at all. All of this is of course based on my personal impressions - other people might really enjoy this DVD, if they have formed different mental images of the characters."
3,"Nice, but George's voice is missing.","From Elizabeth George's first great Inspector Lynley novel, the film version is a standard mystery, with good acting by a fine cast. But George's fans know that her tales are full of internal monologues and psychological insight, and would require more than the time & talent shown here to convey that on-screen. Hopefully future episodes will show less whodunit and more why, directed by someone else."
1,It would be nice if I could view the disc.,"I have been trying to view A Great Deliverance for at least a month now. I purchased the disc from Amazon (twice), an Amazon dealer, and eBay and none of the dvds will play on my player/recorder.Please note that I have had NO problems watching other dvds so the problem exists entirely in A Great Deliverance. I have the first two sets of Inspector Lynley and have thoroughly enjoyed them with no problems viewing any of the eight discs.I see that all of the previous reviews are from 2003 and 2004. This leads me to believe that the current release (2005) of the dvd has a major flaw (it is blank or the wrong regional code or ???).If I ever do get the opportunity to view Lynley and Havers (Oh, I love her), I will be glad to upgrade my rating.Has anyone else had this problem?"
5,Don't move to Japan without it!,"This is the only book I have seen addressing women's issues in Japan. It specifically deals with the challenges Western women face when they live in Japan. It is quite thorough and well-written. The author and her work are very accessible and I would highly recommend this reference to any female planning a relocation. The book is not written for casual vacationers, but can provide useful insights into daily living, if you are curious."
5,A neccessity for anyone coming here.,"An excellent book which gives you a lot of information on aspects of daily life in Japan. And although it is aimed at women, it is totally relevant to men. I wish it had been available before I came here."
3,palm-tree kitchen towels,"I really liked the way they looked in the picture. I was doing some decorating in palm trees, and I ordered 4 of these thinking I would get what was described. when I got them, they were not 'embroidered' as per description. considering they are just 'stamped' towels, I personnally think they were a little pricey."
5,Kaydee Designs Palm Tree Kitchen Towel,"I got 4 of these and they look great. I haven't washed them yet, so can't comment on how they hold up in the wash yet, but so far I am pleased with the look, size and texture."
2,Unfortunately an Unbalanced View,"Dr. Geisler is, unsuprisingly, a very well known apologists, however, and 'apology' is what may be needed for this ""unbalanced"" view of the doctrine of election. Geisler should just come out and say he's Arminian instead of hiding behind the mask of ""Moderate Calvininism."" He equivocates and misrepresents many of the most crucial issues regarding ""extreme calvinism"" (which is how he characterizes the view in this book). Geisler attempts to use certain Scripture to support his views, unfortuantely he seems to be grasping at almost any verse to try and get this ""support."" I have read many of his books and find them very rewarding so it is with sad respect that I have to admit that this was not quite up to par with his other works. However, this book should stir up more contraversy over a much debated issue. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the doctrine of election, but with a warning that this is not a very well balanced assessment of election."
1,Very confusing and very incomplete,"Without question, the two most important texts in the debate over the Calvinism-Arminian controversy are Romans 8 and John 6. While Geisler holds to his 'foreknowledge' view that God foresaw faith in the future of those who would choose Him he fails to make hardly a complete page of comments on John 6. The fact is, John 6 does not support his view. This is a poor book and a book that fails to match the respect Geisler has deserved over the years. His argument against Calvinism and Arminianism leaves him in middle -- a gray area that is very confusing and not well presented."
4,Not Arminian and Not Calvinist,"This book certainly isn't perfect and there's a lot more to read on the topic of free will and election but it's a great place to start for someone wanting investigate these issues.It's just so sad that the Calvinists who accuse Geisler of misrepresenting their positon are often the same ones misrepresenting their opponents. Not everyone who disagrees with you is Arminian.For example, I can believe that we don't lose our salvation and still hold that we have free will.I mean if you really don't believe in free will why do you do so much to try and convince us to change our mind on this issue - perhaps we're just chosen not to believe you!"
1,Confusion or Arminianism?,"Given Mr.Geisler's reputation as a scholar, I was stunned to find that he made the glaringly obvious (Intentional?) error of mistaking classic calvinism, for the increasingly common fault of attacking a straw-man called ""Hyper-Calvinism"". Since most new to the subject fail to understand the difference between biblical, full calvinism and the VERY few people who are so-called ""Hyper-Calvinists"". These few are either against the free offer of the gospel,(which is NOT ""Hyper-Calvinism"") or are either ""Anti-Evangelistic"", ""Antinomian"" or ""legalistic"",none of which is charecteristic of true calvinism. So,all in all, making such a basic error makes Geisler at least an unreliable guide to Predestination. Try Boettner's ""Reformed Doctrine"" or R.C Sproul's ""Chosen by God""."
4,"""A Balanced View of Divine Election?""","OK, I'm sort of stuck between a rock and a hard spot with this one. On one hand, I think that Dr. Geisler has misrepresented the average Calvinist. On the other hand, I think that his own system, i.e., moderate Calvinism, is right on. Too bad he didn't just write a book expounding his own position and leave out the attacks against the other camps . . . the attacks could have been a separate book. In short, however, I think Geisler's position represents far more Calvinists than do the extreme Calvinists. Often people who claim to be ""Calvinists"" are really moderate Calvinists, they just don't know it, but when they are presented the facts, they often identify more with moderate Calvinism."
2,Typical Geisler,"This book is extremely disappointing. As an individual trained in both philosophy and theology I found this book to be poorly researched. ""The Potter's Freedom,"" is a much better book, although far from perfect--both authors could stand to study up on informal fallacies. Although I appreciate what Geisler is attempting to do with his work he is probably one of the least competent Christian philosophers writing. Individuals like Bill Craig, J.P. Moreland, Kevin Vanhoozer, Alvin Plantinga (who Geisler grossly misunderstands), C. Stephen Evans, etc. deserve to be given attention instead of wasting time with a sloppy wanna-be philosopher like Norman Geisler. By the way--I am not a Calvinist."
2,Choose to read another book,"The Predestination folks and Free will folks have been in hot debate since the beginning of the the New Testament era, and it will rage on and on until the coming of our Lord. This book lacks any exegesis and was easily steamrolled by Dr. White's rebuttle. After reading this book I confess that I was irriated and a bit indignant that anyone would actually write a book like this and that anyone could actually read this book and take it seriously. It really is a deplorable book; weak in every way.DO NOT READ THIS BOOK WITHOUT READING JAMES R. WHITE'S REBUTTLE!!! This is not a good book if you take the Scriptures seriously. PLEASE, if you have any interest in what THE BIBLE SAYS read James R. White's ""The Potter's Freedom"". It is the best book on the market that carefully discusses WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS about the subject."
1,Sadly misrepresents Calvinism,"I had read Geisler on apologetics and appreciated the work (even though I didn't agree with every point). But I could not appreciate this book at all because it completely misrepresents Calvinism and then attacks the misreprententation. If you want to argue for Armninianism, which is exactly what Geisler does (always claiming he isn't), then one should at least be honest about your opponent and about your position. A book on this subject should deal at length with Romans 9 directly as well.Get another book, this one will ""win"" the argument simply through misrepresenting everything!"
3,More homework required,"I have only been studying reformed theology for about a year and was hoping to read this to understand another point of view. With only my limited reformed education, I felt that Dr. Norman Geisler didn't really understand the reformed or Calvinistic position and how it relates to free will and choices we do make every day. I was disappointed with his handling of the Scripture and not really answering the strongest of the Reformed arguments. This affects every part of the book as it sets up a straw man that is easy to defeat. I have read Dr. Geisler's work before, and this did not seem to be on par."
1,Chosen But Free,"I have had much respect for the apologetic work of Dr. Geisler. However, Chosen but Free is a careless mess of confusion. Sadly, I gave up on it half way through the appendices. James White's rebuttal, on the other hand, is cogent and refreshing to read after Geisler's depressing diatribe."
4,Smokey Joe's Cafe -is alive and well,"The music is already great, but it really comes alive when you see the cast performing ths show. Simple set design and cool choreography, allows the viewer to really enjoy the musical artistry of Leiber and Stoller. What a stroll down memory lane."
5,Awesome show and tape!,"What can you say? Great music, amazing cast, well-recorded - the only thing better is to see Smokey Joe's Cafe live at El Portal Theatre in the San Fernando Valley - original cast memebers DeLee Lively and Robert Torti will be in it with TC Carson from Living Single, Sharon Catherine Blanks (formerly Sharon Brown) from Dreamgirls, Rent, and Joseph... on Broadway, Jackie Sieden from Jersey Boys and Hairspray, and more...[...]"
5,Rock and Roll Is Here To Stay!,When I bought this DVD I knew very little about the show. I popped it in that night and was fixated on the tv for the next two hours. This show is so much fun. This music is great and the performance are impeccable. I have never seen a more talented ensemble cast and never before have I seen a cast look like they're having so much fun on stage. Victor Trent Cook and B.J. Crosby steal the show with their powerhouse voices and humorous antics. Do yourself a favor and buy Smokey Joe's Cafe. You won't be dissapointed.
5,The Top of Musical Entertainment,"Unbeatable mix of the 50's and 60's music, todays vocal and arrangement styles. Rock&Roll;, R&B; in popular tones.Remarkable and strong on stage performances, extremely high quality singing and dancing.Well thought, amazingly creative still emotional and personal experience captured on stage."
2,broadway show original cast,"I had he CD of this show (very good) Thought I would like the DVD... WRONG....WRONG !!!The singers take a beautiful song from this show and literally sing it to death... Who give one hoot if somebody can hold a note for a minute. The entire show is indicitive of a black church revival. Count me out and I wish I had my money back. Not only do they over do/over sing/scream holler and carry one, they are by far the most unattractive group of performers ever !!!"
2,Nothing Like the Originals,"GREAT songs, of course. But why listen to this when you can still find the originals, which reverberate with the spontaneity, passion, and outright JOY that pop music is supposed to be all about? Listen to the real thing and you will be embarrassed to admit you ever thought these versions were any good."
1,It should have gone up in smoke,We saw a production at our local high school that far surpassed this video! I wish I had my money back - we were very disappointed! You should take it out of your offerings!
3,Broadway review,I saw this on Broadway and knew the music really well so I thought I would get it to see how well they were able to get it on film. The answer is just OK not the best cast and not the best production but the music is still good. You can put it on just to listen to while you read or work around the house.
1,This Leak-Proof Springform Pan LEAKS!!!,"I purchased 2 of these springform pans to replace the 2 flan molds I returned because I liked the fact that they were 9"" in diameter and 3"" high. I read the reviews and with most of them being positive, decided that I would be getting the most for my money with no leakage. Today I prepared a flan in a water bath and all of the carmelized sugar leaked from the pan into the water. I paid $26.46 for the 2 pans and am extremely disappointed with the results. Shipping cost to return anything back to Amazon is ridiculous, especially when the item ordered does not stand up to what is expected. Now I have 2 springform pans that leak and am afraid that even a cheesecake recipe will seep out from the bottom.I have been a longtime customer of Amazon and am extremely disappointed with my last 2 fulfilled orders."
1,NOT Leak-Proof at all!,"I too, bought this pan because it was supposed to be leak-proof. Not be a mile. Mine isn't dented, but it doesn't seem to be perfectly round either and the first time I put it in a water bath, it filled with water. Maybe cheesecake batter won't leak out the sides and bottom (on the other hand, my graham-cracker crust goes all the way up the sides, so batter leakage has never been an issue for me) but you certainly cannot put this in a water bath!And since the bottom has such a large lip on it, it's not as easy to wrap foil around the bottom to keep water out than a regular ""leaky"" spring-form pan.This was not worth the money and I wouldn't buy another one."
3,Product is good if not damaged.,"Mine arrived with a large dent in the side that made it leak. The box it was shipped in was not damaged and the product was shipped alone, so it must have already had the dent before they sent it to me. I tried to explain this to the company but all they would do was offer to replace it if I sent it back, which was not helpful considering the cost of shipping was almost the cost of the item (so I would have been paying twice for one pan). I was able to use some household tools to get most of the dent out, after that the pan worked fine. I baked in it about once per week. After a few months the non-stick coating began to come off and leave black spots on my cheesecakes, and the non-stick coating was not longer non-stick. I guess overall the product is good for the price as long as you are lucky enough to get one that arrives in usable condition, but I am ordering a replacement from a different maker."
3,Leakproof?,"This is my first spring form pan, so take this with a grain of salt, but I don't think this pan is leak proof. I didn't put the cheesecake in a water bath, but when I checked on it I saw the butter from the crust bubbling over the bottom lip, leaking out of the pan into the oven. That to me says that things could leak in as well."
3,glad I exchanged it,"I first ordered this pan back in February, but didn't actually end up using it until April. When I washed the pan I decided to check and see if it really was leak proof. Let's just say that I'm glad it was filled with water rather than batter. But I needed the pan to make a cheesecake, so I ended up really packing the crust along the seams and wrapping the pan in foil. Things worked out ok, but the whole reason I bought the stupid pan in the first place was so I wouldn't have to use foil. I also noticed that the pan had a shallow dent in the side. I'm guessing it was this malformation that caused the leaking. I thought I was out a pan and the money spent on it because it had been more than 30 days, but Amazon was really helpful and sent me a replacement pan on their dime, and paid for return shipping on the busted one. The new pan appears dent free and upon first washing there was minimal leaking. Looks like I'll have to make another cheesecake to test it out :)"
4,fantastic cheesecake pan,great pan for cheesecakes does not leak and only just a bit more shallow than other pans.
1,Leaks!,"After reading all the wonderful reviews, I bought it and tried to bake a flan in it. It leaks!"
2,Is not leak proof!,"I bought this pan to make cheesecake with and thought it would be much easier than having to wrap the bottom in foil to prevent it from leaking. I made two cheesecakes, and I tested this pan at first by putting water in it to see if it leaked and it did not. I made one cheesecake and it came out perfectly. I then washed the pan and checked again for leaks and it kept leaking. The only bad thing about this pan is that because of the lip around the bottom edge of the pan, once it leaks it is kind of hard to just wrap foil around the bottom as the water runs over the lip and straight into the foil, causing the foil to get wet. I was not about to risk my cheesecake batter in this pan and have it go to waste. I wouldn't recommend this pan. I gave it two stars as it did work right the first time. I also received this pan somewhat damaged with it dinged in on a side. This may have made it leak, not sure."
1,Leaked before use!,"I got 2 pans for Christmas. I decided to test them to see if they were truly leak-proof. I put water in both pans and sure enough, water leaked out onto the outer rim. So, I know that if I were to use a water bath to make my cheesecakes, the water would seep in!! NO GOOD. Definitely FALSE advertising on the leak-proof!!"
2,Not What You Get,"It is a gift for someone, so it has not been used yet, but I was very disappointed that I didn't get what was in the picture. I loved the navy and silver, thought it looked really nice. The one I got in the mail was made completely of the non-stick material inside and out so it looks cheaper (not as nice) I searched for this item for a really long time and finally decided on this one, so it was just really upsetting to not get what I thought I was going to get. Hopefully it will still work as well as it says."
5,learning to cook,"This pan works great and cleans up well. I hope to use it many many years,I like the way the color make it look classy"
5,Love it!,"I've only used this once, but I absolutely love it! And you can tell by the plethora of comments that it's a good product! This is the first cheesecake pan I've ever bought, just used breadpans before, and the cheesecake I made this weekend turned out both tasting and LOOKING amazing. It's very easy to remove the siding and put it back on in order to put it in the fridge. The crust cooked beautifully in it as well, much better than it had in the old breadpan. I don't know why it makes a difference but it did. So glad I bought this, my husband and I hate cakes but we love cheesecakes so I'm making these every chance I get from now on!"
2,Cheap and Thin Metal,This is just cheap and then metal. The pan did not leak. The heat transfer in this pan is just crap...very uneven heating. Just go to Walmart Or Target and get a 3 pack of cheap spring form pan's. That is about the same quality as this one and for much cheaper.
3,Too shallow,I've been making a New York style cheesecake for many years in a leaky pan. (I would cover the outside bottom with foil) This pan did not leak but it didn't have enough depth for all of the filling.
4,Jersey Street - Step Into The Light,"Anyone who thinks that good ol' soul disco has no place in this crazy modern world of ours should give a listen to STEP INTO THE LIGHT, the first album by Jersey Street. It's a wonderful amalgam of disco, soul, and gospel, with some deep house thrown in there for good measure. ""How Could I Be Loved"" is a perfect example of how soul can be infused with house and not lose the strong points of either. Feel the sultriness of ""Secrets and Lies,"" or, even better, the smoky late-night torch song of ""Disappear."" ""Cried Me A River"" is an absolute stunner, deep and full of emotion -- definitely the standout on the album. ""Vaya A Vivir"" leads us into some Latin house, but the rest of the album stays firmly downtempo. A solid effort."
2,Oh my Gosh!,"My teacher who has over 3,000 books in her classroom reccomended this book. And I also like Terry Pratchett. bUT THIS WAS A FLAT OUT DISSAPOINTMENT. I quit after the 1st 30 pages. He was very slow in his writings. And he overloads a tad on his British sense of humor.If you like it thats great. But it was very dull and boring for me. No offense to all 14 or some 4 or 5 star reviews. But I do reccomend Only You Can Save Mankind ( Terry Pratchet). It it's a great book about a computer game with connections to aliens. I also reccomend any book by Cornelia Funke. Inkheart and The Theif Lord are my personal favorites. And 2 of my most favorite series are A Series of Unfortunate Events and Harry Potter. Reading Rocks. Get off the computer and read a book!"
1,Terry Pratchett Classic,My friend in England strongly recommended I try to locate this trilogy. She was entirely correct!
5,Glad to see this available now,"We purchased for a niece to read aloud to her daughter, after treasuring it with our now grown daughter. It's a marvelously good humored story, with enough satire to keep adults engaged and plenty to keep kids enthralled. Pratchett's gift is pointing out just how strange our ordinary world is by transposing our reality into a different frame. Essential reading for ages 8-10 to adult."
5,Helpful resource,This is the third order for the mats as they do need to be replace now and again. They work just great. I use them in both ovens and even the toaster oven.
3,spill mat,"Product was a disappointment. This mat is a very thin, stiff piece of plastic. Not pliable as expected, even when spread out and left to straighten there are still buckles and ripples in the material."
4,best thing since sliced bread!,"I haven't been using this very long, but so far it has been superb! Cleans easily and I hate cleaning the oven. Only negative is that it did have some odor at first (or maybe it was the oven cleaner left in there?). If I wear it out I am definitely getting another!!!"
5,Does the job!,"This oven liner (which I've had for most of this year now) is working out just fine in keeping the bottom of my oven spill-free, making my job much easier when it comes to cleaning up after cooking - there is no oven cleanup!! Plus, if there do happen to be spillovers, the film easily wipes clean as described & I'd much rather clean it than the bottom of the oven - hate those burnt on spots! And when you're my age (past 55), it really saves on the back, arms, etc. due to no bending over or having to scrub & scrub even if you do use oven cleaner - bye-bye oven cleaner!"
1,Not as advertised,As I opened this oven liner a piece of paper fell out advising me not to use it as an over liner but rather a shelf protector. .Not as advertized. Change information or pull product!
5,Why pay for an undersized/overpriced craft mat?,"Don't you love it when you find an alternate use for a household item? I do. When I'm slinging paint and adhesives around, a 15 x 18 inch ""Craft Mat"" is inadequate. I will never use this for its intended purpose - because it will be gracing my work area as a wonderful surface protector. Obviously it stands up to heat, so is perfect for heat embossing, hot gluing, etc. Paint and glue just wipes off.Any messy artistic persons, take note. This will save your tabletop, and may extend the length (and quality) of your intimate relationships, if you happen to share space with someone who doesn't appreciate scorched and stained surfaces."
2,Only lasted 6 months,"The idea of having a liner in the base of the oven is fantastic - it really does make cleaning a lot easier. I have a double oven and bought two of these liners. They are the perfect size and fairly easy to clean.However, after six months of approximately twice-weekly use, the liner in the oven I use most often developed huge white patches. I never run the oven over 500 degrees and take it out when running the self-clean cycle. No idea what has happened to it but it looks horrible and no doubt is no longer non-stick. No doubt the liner in the other oven will need to be changed as well. Such a shame!"
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I thought this oven liner went on the bottom of the oven. When it came, the directions said ""not"" to put iton the bottom. I've since ordered another one that doesn't have to go on the rack."
1,Useless!,"These mats cannot be put at the bottom of the oven, under the coils. They are supposed to be put on the bottom rack. When we put them in and turned the oven on, soon a burning smell started coming out of the oven. The liners basically block the heat from coming up into the oven. I purchased a set before at Bed, Bath, and Beyond that are silver, and sit at the very bottom of the oven. I'll be returning to get some more of those!"
3,spillmate oven liner,ad said heavy weight. would have appreciated thickness size. tried to get info from manufacturer. contact was not possible. ITEM IS PAPER THIN. also does NOT go on bottom of oven (must be placed on bottom rack) so if spills run off sheet it does NOT protect bottom of oven. need large cookie sheet (or aluminum liner ) for most efficient usage.
2,not what expected,"I expected a bottom of the oven liner. Instructions in box said to use on the bottom oven rack, not the bottom of the oven."
2,oven liner,"I was expecting an oven liner that went in the bottom of my oven, this liner goes on the bottom shelf. I can use aluminum foil for that a lot cheaper."
5,Great Product,"This oven liner is something I would never be without. I have a self cleaning oven but sometimes you get spills. With the liner, you pull it out, wipe it off and you're ready to go again."
2,Not for the Bottom of the Oven,"I was specifically looking for a liner that could be placed on the bottom of the oven, not on the bottom RACK of the oven. After reading the reviews saying this liner was great for that, and not seeing anything to the contrary in the description, I bought this Spillmat Oven Liner. When I opened the package, out popped a piece of paper with a warning - do NOT put this on the bottom of the oven - it is meant for the bottom rack. It's going back."
4,"So far ,so good",It has been several weeks with all the baking during Thanksgiving mand it has held out well. Over the years I have had many that were thin and burned up after only two or three uses.
3,Oven spillmat,"This spill mat does the job, but is thinner than expected. Also, in areas that have come in contact with a slight oven spill, have shriveled somewhat."
4,Perfect,"Works like a charm, keeps spills off the bottom of the oven. I have always used a cookie sheet or reynolds wrap but this works much better, looks better when you open the oven and cleans up easily."
2,Can't use on bottom of oven,"The liner is fine, but it it cannot be put on the bottom of the over under a heating element or on a hidden heating element. I wanted it to be on the bottom of the oven, but the description doesn't say anything about it."
1,spillmat not for ovens!,my brother told me to buy a spillmat....i did....cheap ....what a mistake....i should have paid a few dollars for more quality .... well next time!
2,thin and cheap,This is not what I expected. I thought it would be a mat. But it's a very thin piece of something. I didn't think it was worth the money.
2,misleading,"I have not even been able to use this product yet! I have been looking for an oven liner for a while, but can only use it on the bottom of my oven as it only has one rack. I have seen so many that need to be on an oven rack that I specifically checked this one for info on that. When i was satisfied that it met my requirements i ordered it. i would return it, but . . . we are getting a new oven soon so i may use it in that one and report back as necessary."
5,Bought Six!,"I have only been using this product for a few months but it is living up to my expectations. I love the heavy weight. I bought a total of six, two for myself (one spare) and four for my son. He has a double oven so I also bought two extra for back up. It fits perfect under the heating element of my electric oven. I know it will save me a lot of work cleaning the oven."
2,It's a drip,"Heavy Weight? Not really, it's actually quite thin and I was expecting something more sturdy. Plenty of ""notes & reminders"" on the box and in the box that tell you it's ONLY for the lower rack and NOT for the oven surface. I plan to find one of better and more realisitc quality that can lay on the oven surface."
2,Flying liner,"This liner is ok for basic ovens, but the one thing to note is that you it flies around if you have your oven on convection. For that reason, I had to take it out. If you do just basic baking, it's fine, but I'm not even using it anymore because it keeps moving around."
1,ruined my new oven,"Regency spilmat oven liner. Used this in my brand new $6,000+ oven. First 2 times it was ok and then the third time it melted a 10 inch diameter spot onto the bottom of my oven. Oven temp was 375*. It stuck and had to be yanked up and soaked to get it up. Bottom of my oven now has a huge spot that looks damaged. DO NOT BUY THIS unless your oven is worth risking."
1,Very disappointed,"This is not what I was expecting. The previous one we had is woven and was placed on the bottom of the oven. . This is just an expensive piece of plastic. Tells you not to put it on the bottom of the oven, which is where I want it to be. Not happy at all."
4,great source Omega 3's ...,"Having store purchased this item ,seems store's inventory is a little fresher ? ( online sardines seem more aged ,darker)"
2,product review,"These sardines taste really good and they are low in sodium. I bought two orders of these sardines and here is my issue: The company places oil on the cans so the cans won't stick together; the oil was not washed off that well so all of the cans had ""goop"" on them."
1,Rubber gloves inside can,"I have been a Subscribe and Save customer of this for some time now. Today, I found a piece of rubber gloves inside one of the cans that I opened. For now, I am grossed out and that ends my purchase of Crown Prince products. I am contacting Crown Prince and asking them for an explanation. I am pretty sure they can at least trace it to some part of the factory (by the color of the glove piece) and get back to me with how it happened."
2,Faulty Packaging,Some of the packages broke and leaked all over the box; so some of them were inedible. Probably won't order again.
3,Small & Lighweight Pan...,Pros:1. Price = $9.99 w/ Amazon Prime (free 2 day shipping)2. Pan is non-stick.3. Pan is lightweight.Cons:1. Dark color non-stick coating is not used on external side like other non-stick baking pans.2. Production description didn't mention about the external coating of pan.3. It only holds 10 cups instead of 16 cups.Neutral:1. Cake line is visible depending on whether you baked a dark cake batter or light cake batter.This will be an ongoing review for the life of this product. Nordic Ware is a good brand name for baking pans.
2,Clogs up very fast,"I bought this filter thinking it would be a better choice than stock. I was wrong. It clogs up very fast. I washed it after every ride but over the course of 700 miles or so it became more and more restrictive. I would not buy another one. They are great on cars, but for an ATV stock is better than these. It also has far less surface area than the stock Arctic Cat filter."
5,Unfamiliar but estimable late romantic American Music.,"This CD continues the series of unfamiliar American symphonic music contained on Bridge 9124A/C, and my review there applies to this disc, as well. It is equally as well performed and recorded, and all of the music has considerable merit."
4,Imagery of Ecstasy,"I really enjoyed this cd, i thought it was well produced with beautiful vocals. The re-mixes were very interesting making the overall cd a good purchase. I will definitely buy the album."
4,They died too young karen carpenter,"I think the book was great,i would lend it to any one but it is a bit short just as you get realy into the book your a couple of pages from the end.wasn't alivein the era of music but i'm very much into that era and a big fan of the carpenters i would have loved to see them in concert.Damon Birkhead 16 Manchester England"
4,Invaluable - but flawed,"A history of Trinidad and Tobago by its ""father"" is clearly invaluable as a primary document, and also as a lead to other primary documents he quotes. Readers should be aware, though, of the context in which it was written - hastily, without thorough editing, and obviously from a position of relative bias given his role in Trinidad's independence movement. Nonetheless, essential reading for anyone interested in learning about or researching Trinidad & Tobago."
5,A great book,"I'm a Trinidadian American trying to learn about my historical background. These previous reviewers convinced me to buy this book. I love it. It is verrrrry in depth. More so than I anticipated. This book helped to elucidate many facts that were unclear to me. It's not an easy read, but just take your time with it. It is a learning experience. I would have liked to learn more about the slavery of blacks and semi-slavery of Indians but it was enough information to get a taste. I'm glad with the amount of information that I acquired with this book. It is very informative. I'm not into historical studies, but I really enjoyed this book. Sometimes it was a bit tedious, but all in all very knowledgeable information. Great read for American Trinis who want to learn their heritage which is very important!"
3,Don't rush,"I just finished this book and I am shocked at all the great reviews. I give 3 stars to anyone who can write a readable novel and this does move and reads well. I liked the Girl's the authors last novel but the scenes in this story made me ill. I did not think they were needed or was the f word over and over. I think Ms. Lansen is a great writer, but this left me kind of feeling sick for reading parts of it, I did like the ending."
3,Too Oprah-ish!,"What started off as an interesting story turned into an Oprah-ish type novel where the characters faced extreme drama at every turn and are faced with unbelievably unrealistic coincidences. I thought that the book would cover an interesting topic of the Underground Railroad as part of the novel took place in Chatham, Ontario, but it did not. I really wanted to enjoy this book, but it left me unfulfilled. I was surprised that the author didn't reunite her main character with her first love, although she DID literally stumble upon his grave. Bad writing, but I give it a ""3"" because some of the characters had potential."
3,"I have read the girls, and expected more","It was a nice story , quite shocking and a bit interesting, not favolous. I will nit recommend it,Pity, still not so bad."
4,Rush Home Road,It started a little slow but once it got going it was a great book. Lots of good characters in this book and it leaves you missing them at the end.
5,This book is simply magnificent!,"This book is for anyone who enjoys a good read and finding out about Ontarian history – particularly black Ontarian history. What is even more miraculous about this book is that is written by a white women, who in my opinion has captured the heart and soul of what it is to be Black Canadian. As a black woman, I did not believe that this author could do justice to the black experience in Ontario – well I was wrong. I am grateful to this author for bringing Addy Shadd, Sharla Cody and all the other glorious characters to life. By becoming involved in these characters’ lives, I was able to discover a part of my history. The greatest lesson I learned from reading this book is that history belongs to everyone and that sometimes it takes a totally unexpected source for us to discover our history."
3,Rush Home Road,"A good read but it hopped back and forth a bit between the present life and the memories of Addy, it's leading character. This was sometimes hard to follow as there was no clear indication when the shift occurred"
5,Always amazing Lori!!!,"I have read this book THREE times and am sure to read it again in years to come. I had read both Rush Home Road and The Girls and it wasn't untill I was cleaning my bookshelf some 6 months later that I realised they were by the same author!! Got so excited I went straight to buy her other book, they are all amazing but Rush Home Road is my personal favourite. It is heartwarming and heartbreaking all at once, I don't want to put much about the plot in the review and give anything away. Do purchase it is fantastic!!!!"
4,A lovely engaging read,"If Oprah's bookclub was back in business this would surely be a novel she would love. Black Canadian history, hardship, heartache and joy all figure prominantly in this very readable first novel. This is the story of Addy Shadd, an elderly Black woman with plenty of heartbreaking secrets in her past. Addy comes to ""inherit"" five year old Sharla Cody, a mixed race child with no father and a less than caring mother. The fascinating story of Addy's life is carefully weaved into her present relationship with Sharla, it makes for a story you won't want to put down. My only minor negative comment would be that at times the volume of tragedy in Addy's life seems overwhelming even for the reader. That aside, I would highly recommend seeking out this novel. 4.5 stars."
5,A MOVING READING BY AN ACCLAIMED ACTRESS,"Acclaimed actress Ruby Dee has an enviable roster of credits: she co-starred with Sidney Poitier in several films, and she's an Emmy Award-winner. Miss Dee gives another award winning performance in the reading of this story of a 70-year-old woman who is forced to relive much of her painful past so that she might save a child.As a child herself living in Rushholme Addy Shadd learned the history of her community, which was settled by runaway slaves in the 1800s. When she is a teenager circumstances compel Addy to leave the home she loves. But, the name of her town becomes a mantra to her: ""Rush home, rush home.""Fate intervenes when a five-year-old girl, Sharla Cody, is left at Addy's trailer doorstep. Surely, Addy thinks, she is not up to raising this child, yet she takes the waif into her home and heart. Sharla brings more than a presence into Addy's life, she brings an amazing gift.- Gail Cooke"
2,Why does she do this? Why do I keep buying this?,"Wendy needs to give it up! This is her second time duping the public, guess what potential readers, she's not going to tell you a single thing you haven't heard on her show, in fact she's even more reluctant to give up information. She can try and deny it all she wants but it is painfully clear that she is afraid of Suge Knight (I can't blame her, but if she's not going to fess up then she should shut up) and she won't release any names involved in scandalous acts. And her photo spreads, sigh, why would she do that to herself? She looks a mess and it is pointless, we want to see pictures of her son and husband so we can have a good laugh, not ancient pictures of Big Lez and Queenpen, sheesh, who cares?There's no juice here, just dried pulp."
5,NO ONE DOES IT LIKE WENDY,"NOBODY DOES IT LIKE WENDY SHE ASK THE QUESTION EVERYBODY WANTS TO HEAR ,ENTERTAINERS RUN FROM HER THEY FEAR HER ,BECAUSE YOU NEVER NO WHATS GONNA COME OUT HER MOUTH, NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER REPORTERS BEFORE THEY DO THE INTERVIEW THEY HAVE TO NOW WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE ASKED, NOT WENDY SHE PUTS THEM ON THE SPOT, CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK."
5,Oh What An Experience,Wendy Williams is just so raw. I love her chapter about Baby Mamas what she said is so true. So true that I cracked while reading it. The way she portrays Kim Porter is hillarious. If you want a good laugh with a whole truth (from her point of view) you will enjoy this book and her first one Wendy's Got the Heat.I used to listen to her in New York everyday and now I just heard that she is syndicated here and I listen to her every chance I get.Later!!!!
3,It was ok!!!,I wish that I didn't spend the money to purchase this book. It is basically a whole lot of what she does on the radio each day. If I had known that I would have just turned on the radio and saved the money.
2,Spanish Dictionary for High Schoolers,"I bought this book thinking it would help me learn and practice my spanish but it really didnt. When i need to refer to it and look up words, the word is never in the dictionary and it doesnt give sufficient examples. Partly because the writing in the book seems to be about 18font that the author didnt write any needed information in it."
4,"A fun, well-written look into the geeky but hypnotic world of fantasy baseball","Sam Walker traces the origins of the game, profiles the super geeks who advise the rest of us, and gives insight into playing in the most competitive fantasy baseball league. The one downer, I think, is that Walker emptied his bank account to have a staff of two full timers, an actress/temptress and a psychic. It makes for good reading, but to me, not as interesteing as if he would have went it alone or with advice from buddies. His moments with the players themselves are excellent, and I walked away from this book with a few new favorite big leaguers, for many different reasons.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who plays fantasy baseball or is just curious as to why those who play it are so fanatical about it."
4,Fantasyland: A humoruos story of the Rules and beginnings of Fantasy Baseball,"If you are an avid Fantasy Baseball fan, this is an absolute must read. This book is to Fantasy Baseball, what 1776 is to American History. Sam Walker is the David McCullough of Fantasy Baseball. He accuratly descibes the sport, and intertwines the story of how Fantasy Baseball got its humble start."
5,Fantasy Baseball Widows - This one is for you,"I totally loved this book. Sam tells a very entertaining story about the thrill of fantasy baseball. The book has enlightened me to the fact that fantasy baseball is a lot more exciting than it looks (i.e: watching the hubby comb through his stats magazines, mumbling to himself about injured players and the DL). Even for those who aren't in the ""know"" about baseball this book is fun to read. I enjoyed this book in the same way I enjoyed Tony Horwitz's Confederates in the Attic, as a fun and educational sub-culture immersion.The book has also taught me that David Ortiz might be the most charismatic guy in baseball.What it comes down to is that this book is great for Fantasy Baseball Widows (ladies - you know who you are). I'm now even excited for the seasons to start. In fact, it has inspired me to play in one of my husband's many many leagues. Sam Walker has created a monster."
5,The Tout Wars,This hilarious romp into the world of fantasy league baseball will keep fans laughing. It's pure entertainment for all new roto junkies!
2,An insincere effort by the author,"First, I admit I am a fantasy baseball fanatic. As such, I looked forward to reading this book. I was very disappointed by this arrogant author's obvious style of embellishing the stories in the book. I suspect he used creative license to produce a successful book. He approached his subject like a writing assignment and not an adventure. I have more fantasy baseball knowledge in my little finger than he will ever have in his lifetime!"
1,WOT = WASTE OF TIME,"The only reason people like this book is because they play fantasy sports and its the only (or close to only) popular book about fantasy sports. On its own, its quite boring and adds nothing at all to fantasy sports. C'mon, if this book were about horse racing, it would be a stinker. Stop stroking your own egos. Hopefully we will get something worth reading, but for now, I'll stick to the so-call experts' excerpts about their fantasy seasons. Try than and you will save many hours. But if you play fantasy sports, and you get a kick of knowing some guy drafted your guy and wrote that in a book, than this one is for you."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this ball workout. I was hoping for a fast paced, high energy workout with some challenging and different moves. I don't feel like I got what I was looking for. The moves are nothing new (if you have done a ball workout before) and my heart rate barely moved.Also, my ball did not work well with this workout. The ball used by the instructor is REALLY large. Mine is the recommended size for my height, but didn't work well with many of the moves she does. Her ball came up to almost high thigh (when standing). (My ball comes up to about my mid thigh--and when I sit on it, my rear is about even with my knees.) This factor made it even harder to get a good workout.Positives: The scenary in the video is nice and the instructor is good. The production quality is better than most workout tapes. And I've given the tape to my mom, who is on a much lower fitness level."
1,not so sure this one's a good idea.....,"I'm concerned that the posting exercises put too much pressure on your knees. Do this repeatedly & you could injure yourself. Overall, you do get your heart rate up in the aerobic exercises but the toning exercises focus mainly on the legs. I was hoping this would be a more balanced workout."
5,Practical and Prayerful,"The last book published by Raymond E Brown prior to his death, it combines serious scholarship and prayerful reflection on the author of the Fourth gospel. The reader gets the feeling that Brown knew the ""beloved disciple"" on a personal basis. Many of the insights he shares about the community of the beloved disciple and the significance of the Fourth Gospel are profound and deeply moving. A book that is a real page turner."
3,Satisfying but with Concerns,"This is the second ""A Retreat With"" book I have read (the first being Matthew).Although Fr. Brown brings out the points of the Gospel of John with clarity, I can see where many more orthodox Catholics have trouble with his writings.Historically, the Apostle John was author of the Gospel and referred himself as the ""Beloved Disciple"". Fr. Brown seems to want to hammer home that he only does not believe this, but the author of the Gospel, the Apostle John, and the ""Beloved Disciple"" are actually three distinct persons.If you can get past the personal bias, this book can help in your spiritual development."
5,Must have for Giga network,"This is a must have if you have a giga network. The speed are phenomenal I honestly am happy with this I can finally stream HD/BD movies and move them across my network with in <15 min.. I choose Intel since I have trusted since it a good brand, even through expensive compared to others..The quality is great.."
2,Intel PWLA89GT PRO/1000 GT PCI Network Adapter,"From everything I read about this Intel network adapter card, it should have worked well with my computer on which I had recently installed Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate. However, when I had trouble getting it to work correctly after a normal install, I searched the Intel support website, only to find that Intel supports only a very few of their network adapter cards under Windows 7 64-bit, and this is not one of them. While I accept it as my mistake that I bought the card without checking the Intel support site for compatibility before I made the purchase (the Amazon product descripton provided no indication of Win 7 compatibility), I strongly suggest that anyone planning to purchase an Intel network adapter check the Intel support site for compatibility with Windows 7 before pulling the trigger."
5,Great Network Card,"I have a Dell Dimension that I bought in 2002 and for a long time suspected a bad network card. After doing some research on various options, including reviews of network adapters on Amazon, I purchased the Intel PRO/1000 GT PCI adapter. It was easy to install. I downloaded the software before I installed the adapter. Turned on the computer and XP took care of the rest. My internet connections have never been better or faster. Great product!"
3,Expected more,"There was a lot of hype going around about these Intel NICs and home built NAS devices. I wasn't too impressed. I have a laptop and a desktop attached to my server running FreeNAS. My copy speeds were at +100MB/s to both devices, but when I installed this NIC into my server thinking it would do the same or better than the onboard NIC, I was wrong. Speeds decreased by half. I went back to the onboard, but I might eventually have a use for it in the future."
2,Screwed without the software,The network adapter would probably be ok if the vendor would have provided software to operate the hardware. Sure one can get drivers off of the net but if one needs the card to get on the net and no drivers are provided it is about as useless as a brick. Thank you Amazon for recognizing my dillema and refunding my money
5,Works with ESXI 5,"Works really well, so far i have had no problems.I bought this to use with Vmware vsphere, also known as ESXI5 and it DOES work."
1,On your own...,"This overpriced adapter arrived without a disc with drivers or anything else.Even after using the ones available on Intel's site this item would not work....so, I returned it,dropped my purchasing price and got one from StarTech (plug and play) and now my computer no longer has a problem--although Intel does."
1,DOA,"This cardIntel PWLA8391GT PRO/1000 GT PCI Network Adapterwas dead on arrival. Very irritating, but it happens. Pitched it in the trash. Now I have to figure out a suitable alternative and hope for better results."
5,Works Great plus comes with low profile adapter,Needed an extra port on the server and this worked great. If i really needed i could have used this on one of our slim line desktops because it comes with the shorter adapter.
5,Works Great with Vista,"I installed this in a three year old Dell Dimension 9100 running Vista 32-bit Ultimate. It works great and the drivers installed automatically. My unofficial performance tests indicate that this card truly delivers gigabit transfer rates. I previously installed aTRENDnet Gigabit PCI Adapterin the same machine and I couldn't get the drivers to load properly. Considering the simplicity and minimal labor required to install this NIC, it was definitely worth a few extra bucks over the lower-cost brands."
4,No drivers or documentation,"I ordered this item after a lightning storm disabled the built-in ethernet port on my PC (and fried my old wireless router). It arrived fast from the Amazon seller but there was nothing in the box except the card. As an Intel product I expected a CD-ROM and instructions. I installed the card and the PC P&P found the new hardware but no driver. So I went to the Intel web site and after a bit of searching found the driver download file and finally the PC could install it. Unfortunately, it worked only intermittently for me, the PC kept saying it was unplugged, so after the new wireless router arrived I set up the wireless adapter which works more reliably - and no cable for lightning to affect."
4,Great little shovel,"This thing is fantastic. It's light, it's super sturdy, and it folds into a nice small size.I took a file to the edge to give it a sharper digging point, this is something I do to all digging tools though. The metal is strong, but takes an edge pretty easily with a metal file.The one downside to it is that if you squeeze the handle to hard the shovel folds. I noticed this when I was digging a hole and was coming down with a stabbing like motion. My natural instinct was to tighten my grip and when I did I could feel the thing fold. After I did this once or twice I was able to remember not to squeeze.All around a great product though. I use it with my gardening around the house, and it will be coming with me on all my future camping trips."
4,Will perform as primary backpack shovel,"This does not take up much space and is lightweight. As a couple of the other reviewers said, you might need to be careful about squeezing the handle too tightly, but pushing the shovel into the ground, prying out whatever dirt, or twisting the shovel around to make a hole bigger caused no issues for me. I WOULD recommend taking a file to the shovel to make the edges sharper for digging in tougher soil. (I live in an area with a lot of thick clay) Once sharpened, I keep it attached on the outside of my pack with a simple strap.Ditch the pouch for a simple laynyard if you are a lightweight packer."
5,Good little shovel - perfect for the trail,"If you're looking for a good shovel for backpacking look no further. This little shovel is perfect in it's case. It hangs from a belt or a pack strap and you're able to easily access the shovel when you need it. When you have to go, you have to go. Having a shovel to dig a pit that is easy to get to, lightweight and sharp to get through roots and other bits. I see this lasting a long time to boot.The one nit-picky part of the shovel that I do not like is the way the handle can close if you squeeze it too hard. In addition, if you have a real strong grip you can take the handle off. I don't see that being too big of a problem - if you know about."
3,good tool but over priced,"This is a great tool a few of my friends have this model but the only problem is I just got an outdoors Walmart brand shovel of the same quality for 4 bucks, save your money"
5,Sturdy and Lightweight,This is an amazingly sturdy product and it weighs very little. My whole family has one for backpacking. They were a great find.
1,CRAP,"i ordered a U-DIG-IT shovel made in the USA with a case. i received a folding shovel from china, with a handle that does not stay in place when you dig with it. and it also came with a case that could easily be mistaken for a candy wrapper painted black. CRAP- DON'T BUY."
2,Needs better focus,"A previous reviewer who accused the book of having too much fluff is, unfortunately, only slightly exaggerating. If the author had taken the time to tighten up the book and used only half as many words as he did, the resulting book would have been first rate useful. As it is, the book is a serious test of one's patience and concentration. The ideas are very reasonable, but the reader has to struggle to separate the wheat from the chaff."
4,thorough grounding in reading material,"This book continues the series by John DeFrancis and follows the organization of the previous volumes. It is very thorough and gives good repetition necessary to become familiar with the new characters. My only criticism would be in the amount of material in each new chapter. I believe smaller and more numberous chapters would make progress easier with less load on the memory.For my taste, the idaal reader would perhaps be somewhat more eclectic in the choice of material. The book tends to concentrate on the academic setting, but that is probably only natural for an author of scholarly background.These are only minor points based n my personal preferences. Overall this reader is truly a landmark achievement."
4,An honest man,"This book covers Joseph Smith's personal, political, and religious life. When you are finished reading it, you cannot deny that Joseph Smith was an honest man."
4,Classic Downey Sr,"If you are an admirer of the ice-breaking film work of Robert Downey, this odd little comedy is worth a look. My understanding is Martin Mull brought it to Downey, having already hammered out a script. It involves a down and out movie maker who gets assigned a porn film and tries to make it into a musical. Delicious performance by Robert Downey Jr as a porn star who wants to be taken seriously as an actor. Jennifer Tilly is fun as the whacky co-star."
5,Funny and Dark,"This is a terrific novel that's both really funny and pretty dark. I'm a huge fan of Donald Westlake's work. I've probably read at least a dozen of his novels in the five or six years since I first discovered his books. Nearly all of them share some qualities that I've come to associate with his work: great characters, sharp dialogue, a strongly satirical tone and a twisted plot. Humans is no different. When God becomes angry with the Earth's inhabitants, he sends his chief angel down to gather a diverse group of eccentrics who will bring about the end of the world. Satan, who needs mankind's sins in order to stay in business, sends his minions to save mankind. It's a wild story with a lot of surprises. I highly recommend it, and I really hope some talented director decides to bring it to film - it would make a terrific movie."
2,Fast Service.,"The book came really fast, however the book was very ""beat"" up. The book had heavy higlighting marks in all different colors. The book had Pencil and ink markings on a number of pages. The book was dirty and somewhat nasty."
5,bovine colostrum,"I have been taking this bovine colostrum for a week. I take about 6 capsules a day and I also open capsules and put the powder in my mouth. So far, I notice a boost of energy and easier breathing. I really like the taste, to me it taste like a Lorna Doon Cookie. I usually have to take some MiraLax daily but since taking the bovine colostrum, I haven't had to and I'm more regular then I have been in year's. So far after a week, that's the main benefits I've had. I did order the powder, I have trouble swallowing the capsules, I hope I like it as well. Being this is a food product with no side effects, I think its a good idea to try this and see if it benefits you in more way's over time, it can't hurt you. I have read some other reviews on the Internet that were satisfied with the Symbiotics brand of Colostrum. Amazon so far had the best price on this product."
4,Ad says,"Keep in mind when ordering this that quantity of 2 is daily dose, so 120 goes for 60 days, not 120."
1,Sad,"This reads like an early teen's fantasies, and the writing level bears this out. The entire book is very degrading to women, but may find a market in junior high boys, which is sad, as it will only serve to perpetuate an immature outlook toward female classmates. My advice: save your money."
1,What the........?,Absolutely horrible.... I wouldn't even use the pages from this mindless story to wipe myself after releiving myself. There is no point to this story and I can't beleive I even wasted my time reading it.
1,couldn't get past the first couple of pages,I thougght that this would be a good read-to get a different perspective. I hated it from the beginning and threw it in the trash. Don't waste your time.
3,Written by a non-chemE,"I just wrote a long review and the browser crashed...The book is lacking in bread-and-butter chemE material. Mass transfer problems are all very simple and solutions are only presented graphically (what if there isn't a graph on the test?). The Kinetics section is only 8 pages long!!! That is only 8 pages to summarize the reaction rates, Plug flow, CSTRs and other goodies. It really need more kinetics.I'd still buy it again."
3,Just a refrence,"I want to update my previous review since i pass the exam, I have to say this book is just a reference, the questions inside the book are totally different from actual exam, my recommendation is DO NOT study the examples just use the tables and figures."
1,Not good,"Like mentioned before written by a non Ch E.Especially Kinetics is very very week.I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.Get yourself a copy of mccabe smith, van ness, Chemical process principles and Levenspiel. That's all you need."
2,Finding God,"Author relys too much on Mother Ammac of India culture. He constantly is referring to Indian Holy people and their written word too much and not much of his own. It seems that he is relaying their message to you. His first book, The Mystic Christ was so much better and presented various religious scriptures all complementing the thought being presented at the time."
1,Motorola H800 Slider bluetooth,I ordered two of these and neither one would charge or power on. I loved the fit and the choice of the over-the-ear pieces but I never got a chance to test the earpieces because they never worked. I'm returning them for a refund tomorrow. I don't even want an exchange.
2,Poor sound quality.,"I made two calls with my headset, both from a location with excellent cell reception and no ambient noise. Both people said I sounded like I was speaking from inside a small metal box. The cheapo headset I had before (also a Motorola) had much better sound quality. What a disappointment! (FWIW, my phone is a Nokia 6555.)On the plus side, Amazon's supplier, Dependable Resource, gave prompt and hassle-free return service."
4,H800,"Works great. slider lock switch is a little difficult to move, but sound is great and operation is simple."
2,"Tinny sound, uncomfortable earpiece - get an H500","Both my husband and I tried this one, switching off with our H500. The H500, while an earlier model, is quite superior. the H800 is light, but bulky so it felt unbalanced on my ear. The most notable problem was it sounded very tinny to people on the other end of the line. I had people asking me to repeat things with the H800 much more frequently than I did with the H500.Motorola, next time don't fix what ain't broke."
2,Uncomfortable to wear,The major problem that I had with the headset is that it is so lightweight that when I walk it moves loosely on my ear.
4,Great headset,"This has been a great headset. It is clear, good range from phone, connects very easily. The earpiece is very comfortable for long periods and comes with 3 ear piece sizes. The only negative is that the earpiece is not a tight fit so it would not be good for activities like jogging."
3,OK for general education,"Book is a good source of information about incorporating in general but the title is misleading and only mentions the particular state in the final chapter, a small one at that. Sample forms are too small in size,"
5,Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan,I bought this pan to use in my pressure cooker. I had never used this type of pan before. Eveything worked so well that I could not believe that this was my first attempt at using the pan and pressure cooker together. I made three cheesecakes right in a row for the Hoidays. Eveyone was perfect and beautiful ... more attractive than commercial ones.
5,Nordic Ware Springform Pan (7 inch),"This is an extremely durable pan ideally suited for cheese cake making. Most other pans, offered in home ware stores, are larger. For the smaller cake, this is most practicle and efficient."
5,Create Yummy deserts,"This Springform pan, is a delight to use, large enough to serve 12 people!Making a Cheesecake or a regular cake, this pan is a must and Amazon carriesvarious sizes and shapes!"
3,Good pan but came dented,The pan is good but when it arrived one side was damaged which makes it difficult to open.
5,7-in springform pan,"This is a great pan. I have a larger one, but this one fits in my pressure cooker. Makes a wonderful cream cheese cake in the pressure cooker."
1,Pan received not pan pictured,"Pan received wil not be pan pictured. Pan will look like Kaiser Bakeware Nobless 7-inch springform pan, model#751603. Pan sent will have correct item#51842 on label from nordicware."
5,Perfect for 6-qt Nesco electric pressure cooker,This is the perfect size for making cheesecakes in my electric pressure cooker. It is very high quality. Can't wait to use it.
2,NOT leakproof,"Before I used it, I actually filled it with water and saw water leak out immediately. Very disappointed."
1,absurd,"The biography here is merely a bait-and-switch scaffolding. Really our putative biographer wants to attack Wells for his supposed ""anti-semitism"". The evidence presented, such as it is, is culled very selectively, mischaracterized, and hyperbolically flailed at. Wells was not anti-semitic; he was anti-nationalist. Read instead Anthony West's ""H. G. Wells: Aspects of a Life"" or, better yet, H. G. Wells's ""Experiment in Autobiography""."
2,Too Small,The person I purchased this for is tiny. I had hoped the camisole would fit loosely. It barely fits at all and she will not be able to wear it in public. It is not a Women's medium. It is more like a child's medium. I am very disappointed since this was a gift
1,Unbelievably disrespectful!,"What were they thinking!? There are only a couple things I can say about this film and they are:1. They attempted to turn one of the most tragic disasters on Earth into a animated musical. That's like making a romantic comedy off 9/11! What the heck! They should have payed some respect to the victims of Titanic2. How did the film end Happily ever after? The film ends when the main characters are all saved, and live ""happily ever after"". Did the director just ignore the fact that hundreds of people died? Apparantly so3. it inaccurate and just plan stupid. I mean what's the point of the rapping dogs and the little animals? Nothing!4. The plot is basicly a rip-off of Titanic(the James Cameron movie). Even the characters kinda look like the ones in the James Cameron version.Overall this movie is terrible, disrespectful, and plain stupid"
1,A Horrible Movie of TITANIC Proportions,"This animated adaption of this so-called ""movie"" should not be seen by the human eye. It's because of the infamous traumatizing, horrible ""rapping dog"" scene. It rots both your brain and your very innocent soul. This movie SHOULD sink into the depths of the ocean like the titanic."
5,A keeper!,"My not quite 3 year old son discovered this book in the preschool library and ADORES it. This year his birthday party is at a fire station, and although they probably won't have a fire cat there, he will have one at home forever more when he opens the gift of his very own copy of Fire Cat.Unlike other reviewers, I never heard of this book and at first thought it was kind of boring..as I read and reread it to my son, I discovered the beauty in the story and understand why he is so taken with it!It will be wonderful to keep this in his permanent library and remind him of it someday when he has a child of his own!"
5,A Great book for those who are beginning to read!,This was one of the first books I ever readIn my late 30's I still had a copy.A story about a small cat who starts outchasing other cats and being mean.He is adopted by a Fire Stationand becomes The Fire CatOne day he rescues a small kittenand becomes a good cat.This is still my favorite book ever!
3,A little disappointed.,"I was told some of the pages were going to be slightly yellow...just didn't think it would be as much as it was. We are going to keep it, however."
5,One of THE classic early reader books,"This is the first book I can clearly recall reading on my own (I'm 39). My Dad used to read it to me, and one day I read it to him. I remember him proudly calling my Mom into the room to hear me read it from cover to cover. I recently discovered a copy at the ""used books for sale"" section of my library, and excitedly rushed home to read it to my five year old. He loves it. This is a conceptually brilliant book for children. This is a great book for several reasons. First, it teaches the virtues of kindness and hard work. Second, it has superbly crafted simple sentence construction, and it's written to facilitate early reading by using word and concept repetition. Third, it has great illustrations and easy-to-read type. It also has three chapters, which was a new concept for my son.This is one of the all time great early reader books. If there is an early reader in you life, get it for him or her!"
5,My childhood depended on it!,I had a flashback to this book the other day. Who could forget Pickles the cat with big paws and big things to do... I bought it and read it to my niece and nephew. JOY!
4,Fire Cat Saves the Day!,The Fire Cat by Esther ArerillOnce there was a homeless cat that lived in a barrel.His barrel was in a old yard.Pikles chesed little cats.He had a friend named mrs GoodKind.One dayPickels chased a little cat up a tree . Hewould not let the cat back down the tree! the wind blew.Rain fell down.Now both cats wherein the tree.Pickles let the little cat back down.mrs goodkid called the fireman becausepickels was to scared to come down . After he got saved he became a fire cat .Ilike this book because i like firemen.GORDON grade 1
5,"I loved it as a kid, and I love it now!","Even though it isn't a ""funny"" book, I find myself utterly amusedwith the pictures. The story is simple and charming.The book is a classic in my eyes, and very special to me. I hope it will be for you too."
5,This CD is AWESOME!,If you like acappella then you will love this album. The mastery and talent of these performers is unlike anything you can hear! BUY IT TODAY!
2,Very light weight pan for Nordic Ware,"I own several Nordic products and am very pleased w/ their quality. So when I received this pan today, I was disappointed that it is so light weight and definitely a much lesser quality than my other NW cake pans. The pattern is nice. The only reason I'm keeping it is due to the shipping and restocking fees. I may change my rating after I actually use it."
4,Pineapple Upside Down Cake Pan,"The cake pan works allright except it waas sticking in a fewplaces. This may be because a recipe was not included in theorder so I used my own recipe. I was under the impression thata recipe was supposed tobe included but it wasn't. Could youpossibly send me one? I would appreciate that very much,Thankyou. BERTHA CRICH"
2,Cheap Nordic Ware,"My wife owns several of these items and I was shocked when I got home and saw how flimsy this item really is. All of her other Nordic Ware is very heavy and thick and extremely strudy. This item is like sheet metal thin.To the credit, it does have the same look about it as the other items she owns and it did cook OK. However, the heating times and cooking are faster in the thin metal and she did complain that it did not seem to be cooking evenly throughout and was a bit more done on the edges.I would not recommend this item to a serious baker. I think it is a ""cheaper"" class of Nordic Ware if there is such a thing and i would not buy again from Amazon unless I could see enough pictures to know that I was getting the heavy duty stuff."
4,Nordic ware pineapple upside down cake pan,I did not think that the pan was deep enough but I like the way my cake turned out very nice.
3,"Low end, low quality line of Nordic Ware","As others have noted, this is the bottom end, lower quality, flimsy, nordic ware. It does not cook as well as the good stuff.I wish they would label this line of products as ""budget"" or something so that amazon.com/online buyers can be certain of what they are buying.In the future, for those who are addicted to the premium CAST aluminum Nordic Ware pans, note that in amazon's descriptions it will almost always say CAST aluminum if it is. Also double check the product weight. The flimsy pans generally weigh just a few ounces. The cast aluminum pans weight POUNDS.Happy baking to all!"
3,Eating Cake,I wanted this item and I got it. This product haven't gotten that much use yet. I think that the pineapples slices that I have found are alittle to big for the lay-out in the pan. Overall a good product.
1,No range at all,This device has no range at all. I bought the device because I live in the city and there's a lot of interference on the 802.11b/g (2.4ghz) frequency. I have 5.8 Ghz phones and they're great with great range. I thought that 802.11a on 5Ghz would have similar good range. WRONG.This device can't be seen in the next room. It's performance is awful. Don't buy it.
3,New York streetfights and Capoeira!!,"Yes this is a low budget money but who cares..theres a lot of action and the characters have a development, nice to see T kickin the b.... of the drug dealers of east New York and his friends helping him, i love this movie. but not try even to compare it with ""Only the Strong"""
2,so jam,"I'm sorry but it isn't the kind of music that I like to listen. I listened it because I thougth it was a cd of house music, but it's more jam than other thing. If you like jams and this kind of culture I think it is for you."
2,Very Difficult to Set-up,After many tries I found this bit to be just too difficult to set-up. Perhaps someone with more patience would have a better experience. Not recommended.
1,Save your money!,"I can't recommend these. Maybe it was just my ears, but the product claims to reduce noise up to 42 db? Hah - I used it on 2 flights and it barely cut out any noise - low frequency or high frequency - used it outdoors and there was hardly any difference. I replaced them almost immediately with the pair of NR headphones that I had lost......"
4,Works great.,"Blocks out the surround sound very well. If you are accustom to wearing foam earplugs, then you should not have any problems."
1,Waste of time,"I bought this book thinking it would help me better understand, and hopefully remedy, my fear of commitment. While it is cleverly disguised as a self-help book, in reality it is just a string of stories about the author's friends. The bulk of the book consists of the relationship histories and life stories of these women that the author knows: Paula, Annie, Sarah, Eva, Susannah, Maggie, Lila, Elizabeth, Isabel, Karen, Jane, Kate, Lydia, and Cynthia. I drudged through each woman's story, hoping that I could glean some kind of advice or explanation for my own commitment-phobic behavior. Unfortunately, I found no such luck. The author offers explanations for each woman's fear of commitment, but unless you have the exact same history as one of these women, these explanations are of little help to the reader. If you're looking for help with your fear of commitment, don't expect to find any here."
2,Lost interest in this book after the second page!!!,"This is not a book i would personally recommend. Every two minutes into reading this book i found that i had to run for the dictionary as this writer loves to use big and complicated words and meanings. Not a real good book to read if your from outside the U.S. such as myself, as the author refers to a lot of things within New York. Has been a put off for me to read any more of her material."
1,Never returned a book until now,"This book is horribly written. There are glaring grammar errors which make the book impossible to read. Hopefully the proofers have been sent back to kinder-care. Moreover, there are sections in the book where they cut-and-copied the syntax explanation into the example section. But they forgot to change the text to an example! Look at the section on xinetd for an example. This one had to go back. This is too bad. We really need an good book on this topic. Sorry Mr. Ziegler, get better proof readers for the 3rd edition."
3,Amazing Crystal Ball Gazing review,"I have not read the second edition of Linux Firewalls, but to complete the form I had to select the number of stars I would assign to this book. Neither have any of the people who have their reviews published on this website. How do I know? Check the review dates, they all predate the release date of the second edition of Linux firewalls, some by a year or more. I presume these reviews are for the first edition. How about stating these reviews apply to the first edition? Or maybe just don't include them. Possibly we are to infer the first edition and the second edition are identical in content and one is just a reprint of the other, if that is the case I might as well save some money and just buy the physically older but content wise current first edition! Unbelievable! But I suppose this will never make the web page because it is dangerously close to the embarrassing truth."
3,Rushed,"This book is excellent for setting up a firewall under Linux; I'm sure a clueful newcomer like myself could get something working well with little difficulty.However, I couldn't help but feel the book had a rushed-to-print feel to it. There are *many* typos and errors. Moreover the author repetitively lists every single command line for the different services and IP addresses being handled by the firewall, which along with over-tabulation of protocol information appears to be unnecessary padding to fill the book out. ""And similary for the rest"" would have been appropriate in many parts of the book.3 stars."
4,Great book,"Great book it covers all the themes I could expect, it assumes some networking knowledge.would have been good to have this book on hard cover"
1,Useless on 64 bit,"This is useless with Windows 7 which runs on 64 bit. Viewers should be advised on ALL programs if they can be used on 64 bit operating systems. So, I wasted my money and won't get it back because I opened the package. The only requirements shown for this program is you need a CD drive thus leaving one to think it will work in any computer. Ok, you got me but never again. I won't risk saying what I'm really want to say. Just beware before buying (if you can)."
3,Picture Publisher 7? Now use PP 10.,"Picture Publisher 10 is available free online -- just look for it. I've been using it for the past couple of years on a Win7 - 64 bit machine, installed as a 32-bit program. Yes, it can crash unexpectedly, so saving regularly is a must, but I started using Micrografx's older versions in 1997, and am still pleased to be using this one. It's friendlier than Photoshop Elements, perhaps because I know it better. Still my go-to graphic creator and editor."
4,Duplicate program with different name,For those still using the obsolete program: Micrografx Draw 6 this is the 'image editor' a few things have been added but not enough to want me to keep it in my computer so I uninstalled it.If they hadn't changed the name I wouldn't have wasted my money.I rated it 4 because I love Draw 6 and the image editor was part of the program and I use it everyday (with my Draw 6) but I don't need another one.
5,Fond Memories,"My Godmother gave me this book for Christmas 1964 (I was 4 years old) and it remains a treasure from my childhood. I'm trying to find another copy to give my nieces first child for Christmas this year. My copy is in excellent condition, but I can't seem to part with it! You just can't find beautiful books like this anymore!"
5,Been Looking For This Book For Years,I too used to read this book at night as child. It has stuck with me almost 45 years later. Brilliant and wonderful little book. Glad to see so many others feel the same way.
5,Great Album!,"Neah has the unique ability to touch your soul with her music. Many of her songs from this album (and her first one) are on my top 25 play list. As a missionary in Asia, I spent a lot of time traveling in rural areas and hiking mountains. Her music often ministered to me during those times. Thanks Neah!"
3,3 chapters too long,"For the first hundred or so pages, I thought OLD SCHOOL *almost* merited the favorable comparisons to A Separate Peace. John Knowles' classic is the benchmark against which I measure any boarding school coming of age story, and the only media event in the last 20 years that has in my mind come anywhere close to it is ""Dead Poets' Society."" Tobias Wolff's well-written and intriguing novel almost gets there, although I wish there were more fully-developed characters than just our anonymous narrator. But the last three chapters took the novel in a direction it didn't need to go, and told an utterly superfluous side story. I was very disappointed in the ending of this otherwise appealing work. Mr. Wolff should have stopped writing three chapters sooner."
4,Charming Book With a Couple Notable Pitfalls,"""Old School"" is Tobias Wolff's first novel. It seems strange for such a revered author to have just accomplished this, but it was worth the wait. The majority of this novel, dealing with a New England boarding school, and three writing competitions, which bring to the school Frost, Rand, and Hemingway, is a joy. It conjures up the days when writing was cool, and the novel was America's most respected form of art. The book is a great examination of the trials, anxieties, and pitfalls of wanting to be a writer. Unfortunately, Wolff misses out on creating a classic, because of a couple chapters at the end that seemed almost like add-ons. The narrator, also, is a bit of a tabula rasa."
5,There are a lot of cats in this story,"There were so many funny parts in this book, but that line was my favorite. I worked on the literary magazine myself in school, and I was everything the dean said I would be.The different story lines went together so nicely -- it wasn't like a tapestry, which is what you would first want to say about it; more like the pieces of plot were holding hands with each other. Also, pretty much every word felt so valuable as you read it that when you find things out like what the narrator's roommate is up to, or what's in the dean's past, you can remember every single thing the author said about them, and you just feel everything all at once.Basically every event in the book revolved around themes of sincerity and mockery, but it was never redundant or boring, and none of it seemed contrived.I tried to avoid buying this book, but once I read the part about the girl on the train, I knew I was probably going to read it several times, so I had to have a copy of my own."
1,Beyond boring!!,"This book is one of the worst I have ever read. It is boring beyond belief and just rambles on. I simply don't understand how anybody can consider this good writing. The story is very difficult to follow primarily because there is no character development nor anybody you care about in the book. Also, why or why did this author not use quotation marks when people were talking. I think it would have helped a bit, but then again the conversation was so insipid it probably doesn't matter. Between this and the equally boring Empire Falls which our book club also read last year, I will be hard pressed to ever read anotheer book about life in New England."
3,sbard,This book plodded for me. I was quite a bit into the book before it got interesting for me.I did appreciate it was another time and quite different situations than today.
5,Compelling Novella About a Boy,"Wolff whose previous work includes ""Bullet in the Brain"" and ""This Boy's Life"" shows his mastery of prose again in this well written piece. This story of hidden idnetity and the struggle to succeed and follow, paints a vivid world. Each moment is interesting and forces the reader to continue. Fans of literature will appreciate Wolff's tie-ins of such greats as Hemingway, Frost and Rynd. A somewhat brief tale, it accomplishes so much more than it's length implies. A must read for anyone who appreciates well written prose."
3,I was hoping for more...,"A story about a working-class boy that attends a New England preperatory school in the early 1960s; he has a great passion for literature, and aspires to be a writer himself. Wolff has created a sort of memoir, as well as a coming-of-age novel.Honestly, I was expecting a little more... this was my first book to read by Wolff, I heard many good things about him, and read a review that highly praised it... yet, I thought there were many unanswered questions."
2,Old School,"Reading this novel is very difficult because the plot of this story is very bland, and has no real point to it. The protagonist is arrogant who thinks of nothing but winning the writing contests, and becoming a famous writer. He takes his dream to the extreme that he even plagiarizes someone else's story and calls it his own without truly realizing what he had done. There is no real form to this novel because it lacks all the essential parts of a story; for example there is no sign of a rising action, climax, or falling action. This book just rambles on about the narrator's dream to win a contest so he too can become a famous writer."
1,Unfinished,"As an English teacher, OLD SCHOOL hooked me early and I found it hard to put down. Yet, when I reached the end I was ready to throw it down. The last chapter was disconnected and felt as if Wolff was trying to force the connection between the issue of integruty faced by both the narrator and his Dean (Arch. The connection is severed or weak at best.The themes he deals with also seem unfinished. The narrator never fully struggles with his Jewish heritage - it is mentioned a few times, but where is the angst the narrator should be experiencing. Even his issue with plagiarism seems somewhat glossed over (I got caught, got booted from school, and now I'm a great writer? PLEASE!).I think Wolff creates a vivid voice in his writing, but he needs to finish the contract he makes with the reader when he introduces themes and ideas."
1,Old School,"The novel Old School is a tale of integrity. While reading it, you experience many twists and turns, but ultimately goes absolutely nowhere. There is no emotional connection with the narrator, let alone any of the other characters. You go through this long boring story with this boy who has no life, and you hit the ending and you're dumbfounded. Are you kidding, that's the ending? A book can atleast redeem itself if the ending is somewhat exciting, but I think this ending placed this novel into the negative stars. Maybe someone out there will find this novel great, but it was not for me."
5,doesn't miss a single nuance,"as a product of boarding school, as a parent who sends her children to boarding schools, as a writer, as a sometime teacher, and as a student who can still remember her teacher's comments on a senior English paper on Absalom, Absalom, I savored every word of this story. It's nearly unbearable in its depictions, the velvet-hammer scenes and soft-shoed tension, to mix a few metaphors. The observations on honor, on truthfulness, on resignation, on competition, on the love of school it's uncool to acknowledge, and on shame, are accurate and poignant. I've been waiting for this novel since I first read an exerpt in The New Yorker, and wasn't disappointed. Can someone please tell me where Tobias Wolff went to prep school as a scholarship student?"
1,Waste of Money,"First of all it don't even phase either one of our dogs. We have had a problem with them being on the couch, tearing up garbage and destroying our garden. We used a half of bottle on the couch and the rest outside. They never even hesitated like it wasn't there. The couch is still their favorite spot in the house. The garbage bags still get shredded and they are still chewing up my palm tree's. I paid over 20 dollars to buy it and have it shipped to where we live for nothing. Don't waste your money."
2,did not work for me,I bought this product to help keep my dog from using the bathroom on my son's carpet. It did not deter him at all. Not sure if it was the use indoors or the product.
5,Tough and Reliable,"This bucket is collapsible and has a really tough, thick rope. Its bottom is tough plastic, and it can be set on the ground, or hung on a hook. It is a great bucket!"
4,One woman's journey through Africa.,"Terese Svoboda's Cannibal can best be described as haunting.Its terse prose is well written. Cannibal tells the story of awoman's trek through Africa; following the man she loves. As their journey unravels she begins to suspect that he is not what he appears to be, and in fact he may be starving her. The story is told from inside the woman's head. It is all reflective dialogue; in this case it works, and keeps the reader's attention. If you are interested in Africa, and like dark psychological discourse in literature; then this book is for you."
2,DON'T GET TOO EXCITED,"I was really excited for this book to come out but it is lacking a few things. First off there is little if ANY room to write any addition things in the book. (A blank note page here and there would be great!) Basically they have the same work out sheets, and food prep sheets as they do for free on the BFL website but instead here it's in color, oh yeah and you have to pay for it. They don't even have a sheet for your free days for you to write how you were feeling. (It goes days 1-6 8-13, ect.) I think they could've done a much better job. Bet hey I am going to try and use it anyways!"
4,"There's only one catch, Catch-22!","I apologize, but I am a total Body-for-LIFE devotee (read Bill is my hero -- LOL!). One of the very best things that ever happened to me was learning about the BFL book (I went from 33% bodyfat to 17%). Now with my new journal I am going down to 8% bodyfat! I was fortunate to get the Journal as a Christmas present and there's only one catch -- Catch-22 -- I wish it had been designed so I could fold over the cover to half-size and record actual weights and intensity levels in the gym as I go -- I currently use the online forms that I printed out to take to the gym with me and they're handy. And I like the idea of extra blanks pages that another suggested below. But, hey, long live Bill Phillips (sung to the tune of God-save-the-King)! LOL!"
3,Helpful addition but not necessary for the programme,The BFL Success Journal is exactly that - it's a journal in which you chart your progress whilst following the Body for Life Programme detailed in the book of the same name.The Body for Life book is a fantastic programme that changed my life (24 pounds fat lost and 13 pounds muscle gained in 11 weeks). I did not have the journal when I completed it. The Success Journal would have been handy (and saved me hours of xeroxing the sheets from the book!) but if you have limited $$ spend them on the book first. It is the true key.
2,"Helpful, but...","...there were but so many times I could repeat the same ""goals for the day"" and how I was going to help others on a daily basis. I think it would have been better to state those things once a week at most. There was no place to put down how I was feeling like you would typically do in a journal. After about day thirty, I stopped using the journal. It was just too repetitive and I couldn't come up with anything new. I did like the daily ""Lesson-For-Life"" written by Bill Phillips. But, the rest of the journal was just too repetitive.I would change the journal in it's current format to just be a weekly entry instead. I still highly recommend his original book ""Body-For-Life"". I get more out of that, reading bits here and there, than the daily journal."
2,Make sure you like and are committed to the format.,"While I am a Body for Life devotee, I do not find that the journal is compatable with my needs. The journal is set up so that Day 1 (upper body workout) appears on the first two pages. The next two pages are for Day 2 (aerobics). Day 3 is two pages for lower body. I prefer to keep my progress on a single page for upper body and another page for lower body. This way I can easily see at a glance where I have improved and where I have been slacking. Also, as a new page is created for each workout, you must rewrite your lifting program each time. If you generally keep the same program for 4 to 6 weeks, the book requires a lot of additional writing time.Too, if for some reason you need to change up the order of your days you are stuck jumping around in the journal. For instance, I started the journal on a lower body workout day, so I had to start the journal on Day 3. If, however, these are not concerns of yours, the journal is a nice thing to have."
3,"Great, but too big","I am a 24 year old male and I am a huge advocate for the Body for Life program. When all else fails I always turn to this program. Anyway, I have order this training guide when I first began, the only problem is that it is waaay to big. They could have easily compact this down to a 8 x 5 book that would be a lot more portable and more easily manageable. But I guess when your really motivated and want to change your life, your willing to haul around anything!"
2,Not for me,"This book is too bulky to go with me throughout the day. I prefer something smaller that will fit inside my pocketbook. When I'm ready to journal re: my diet, I'll go back to Weight Watchers."
2,Misleading book,"I have tried different methods of bodybuilding, and am still trying different methods, during this journey of achieving my the ultimate goal ( the fit lean body ) i face many misleading sources ( people, books, articles, magazines,,,,etc) and this is one of it. I dont recommend at all for those who wants to do bodybuilding, neither loose weight and gain muscle and become pumped; but if you want to bust your fat out and get fast results its good. Simply because the author is relying on the high reps and sets method, which burns fast quick but it consumes alot of energy that will be taken from your muscle glucose which will leave your muscles tired and unable to develope, so it's mainly for fast fat lose, and not muscle development, the best thing in this book is the nutrition section it's very useful, if you wiling to get into the world of bodybuilding get another book !"
5,GREAT gym log and journal,"I love this journal! It works great at the gym because its well made and durable. Its an excellent tool to keep track of your physical and mental growth, as well as your food intake."
4,Good Companion Journal,This is a good journal to have if you are following the advice of Bill Phillips. I am hoping to have the success like others have had from this program.
3,Too much writing,"I love Bill Phillips and love the BFL program -- but there is just too much writing involved in this book. I did love having the work out and food journals all together in one easy place, but the book asks you to write down daily goals, etc. It asks for you to record three things (each day) that you can do to help someone else. EVERY DAY. It's just too much to ask out of me. So, if you're as lazy as I am (and you're lucky to even be doing the BFL program at all), it's a little more than I bargained for I guess. I'd be happy downloading the worksheets I need off the BFL site daily and filling them out. And it probably wouldn't cost me [so much for] paper and ink."
2,And I needed this because....?,"While I'm a huge BFL fan and believe it is the ONLY successful weight loss program out there and I think Bill Phillips rocks, this journal was NOT helpful. I need something I can put my own things in (pictures, for example). I needed to reorganize the pages to make it more user-friendly. I did not follow his workout days as my schedule starts with cardio instead of weights. Plus, there are only SO MANY daily goals you can have before you need a rubber stamp pre-printed with ""Sign onto the BFL website"" or ""Drink enough water"". I prefer the regular BFL book and my own binder, thank you very much..."
2,a lot of print,"this book contains a lot of words. The book focuses on exercise that I can not do. I was hoping it would focus on thoughts and feelings while managing my food. It is devoted to exercise and does have little stories to help stay on track. I wanted more stories and thoughts to ponder. I was disappointed in this book. I did get it used and paid little for it, the book is plentiful used!"
4,Whose afraid of the big bad pig? definitely for over 4's,"Nice little book which tips the concept of the three little pigs on its head. My under 5 year old girls have started to understand that the story of the three little pigs has been told from a different perspective - now it is the three little wolves and the big bad pigIllustrated beautifully by Helen Oxenbury it is a fun and funny story. a new morality tale.I think I enjoy it more than my two girls though, they can see that it is funny but I have a feeling that they are still really too young to appeciate it completely. It is more for the older child (4 and up definitely)as the humour is just a bit more sophisticated than they are ready for.I will re-introduce this for them later as I do enjoy it and would like to share with them"
5,"My favorite ""kids"" book as an adult","When my daughter first brought this book home from kindergarten I tried to read it to her. I couldn't! I was laughing so hard that I couldn't make it through. I evently did, and my daughter loved it. She then took it to have her grandmother read it to her, the same thing happened.Even today, as an 11 year old, my daughter loves this book. It is one of the few ""children's"" books that still remain on her bookshelf.Is there a moral? Does there have to be? It is a funny, lighthearted story, that gives kids the opportunity to explore creativity by changing things as they know it.I have shared this book with several of my daughter's classes, and each time I have, I have been told that there have been several more orders for this book.Is it a classic? Probably not. It is entertaining? Most definately."
5,Exquisite!,"My mother in law has long been animatedly telling my three yr old the story of the three little pigs whenever we're stuck in the car for a while-- and he loved every minute of it, every time. My husband and I were already big fans of Helen Oxenbury (Check out ""We're Going On a Bear Hunt"")-- so when we saw this, we were sold. But we had no idea we'd instantly love it *this* much. Other reviewers have given away it's secrets--suffice it to say that I was not expecting the pig to pull out a drill, or the wolves to refer to all the tea leaves in thier china tea pot! I'm more than willing to read it to my son again and again-- and that's saying a lot for a children's book. I'm online right now getting it for my neice who will be one in 3 days-- but I'm really getting it for my brother ;o)"
2,Violent for the target age,"This is cynically funny for adults in a kind of sick way, but pretty shockingly violent for kids. The pig uses jackhammers, dynamite, and other tools to destroy the wolves concrete houses."
2,blame the victim,"The book is cute, engaging and sweet. My kids loved it. I can't stand it, so I am getting rid of it. It leaves me with the impression that the author believes that people are aggressive because their victims are defensive. Reading the part where the wolves say ""there must be something wrong with our building materials"" after the pig destroys their highly defensive homes makes me incredibly uncomfortable. This is not just saying that you may be able to repel evil with kindness. It is saying evil exists because you resist evil."
5,Subverts the original in the best way possible.,My children love this role reversal version of the classic story and so do I!
5,hillarious.....,"Our oldest son read this book at school and he liked it so much that he insisted we buy it. When my husband and I read it we could not stop laughing. It puts an unexpected twist on the original story of The Three Little Pigs. You can't wait to turn the page to see what the Three Little Wolves will come up with next and what the Big Bad Pig will do to destroy it. There is also a surprise ending. The story is hillarious and the pictures are excellent. This is definitely going to be one of our favorite books. I don't think we will ever get tired of reading it to our boys. Buy this book, I promise you will love it."
3,"Brilliant story, distracting pop-ups","The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig has been a favorite story in our household for many years. We love it! I can't recommend this story enough!!!! The big bad pig is a tyrant and the wolves are such ingenious engineers, it makes the Big Bad Pig look even more formidable with his sledgehammer and dynamite. I recently purchased the pop-up version for a friend, but can honestly say I enjoyed reading the ordinary book more than the pop-up version. The pop-ups were very distracting and I think it takes away the energy from the story and the reader becomes disengaged, trying to fiddle with all the contraptions. I vote for the good old-fashioned book version any time!!"
1,Not for me :(,"I did not like this story at all. I found it disturbing. The pig smashes the wolves' houses with a sledgehammer, then a pneumatic drill. The wolves build a house that looks like a cross between a bank vault and a prison, complete with barbed wire, which is destroyed when the pig uses dynamite to blow it up. This is just not my kind of humor. I was looking for a cute/funny story for my kids and this was not it."
2,You're No Walter Williams,"This writer makes some good points relative to government's responsibility to protect the people from unbridled capitalism. However, he goes way too far in trying to trace our current economic troubles to Ronald Reagan. Also, do not make the mistake of confusing this author with the brilliant syndicated African American columnist Walter E. Williams, and Amazon errs in suggesting a link between their writings. Walter E. Williams would find much in this book antipathetic to his own beliefs. Walter Williams is no Walter (E.) Williams."
1,Bait and Switch,"FYI, I thought I was getting some kind of unique political insight from Walter E. Williams, unfortunately I was wrong. This is not the author I expected. This book is not about freedom and personal responsibility. It is another proponent of mob rule. Without the middle E. you do not get an excellent author."
5,Shaping a plutocracy,"This history/critique of the last generation of American politics makes central the shift in public institutions since the onset of the era of Reaganism. The drift toward the right and the systematic attack on the New Deal obviously have their roots earlier, but it is the interval of Reagan ascendancy that reshaped the American governmental system in a decisive, and destructive manner. The creation of a plutocracy using all the tools of propaganda to make that seem a populist initiative is the most insidious aspect of the operation. Trenchant analysis, and unafraid to face the facts."
5,Smells like Santa Fe,"I love this incense, it burns slowly and smells delicious. Just like a drive through New Mexico. Yum."
1,Not For Young Adults!!!!!,"I chose this book for my 14 year old sister who adores fantasy fiction. On a lark, I read the book first. There is a unexpected rape scene involving the heroine which was as disturbing as it was detailed. When it was over, she asks her rapist for money! If I had wanted a brutal, realistic novel for a young teen, I would have bought something else."
3,Rather Interesting,The plot was okay. I thought that she was a little naive and not very....protective of herself. I thought some of the parts the book could have done with out. But a pretty interesting book.
4,Hmm,This is a really good book except for the two pages in which the heroine is raped (in great detail) which the book did not need.
1,"I laughed, I cried.","This story and the characters are copies of the generic figures you've met in inumerable other fantasy novels. The setting is the same familiar squeeky clean washed-out Hollywood quasi-medieval setting. The so-called heroine relies upon various men to protect her and define her and lacks a spine or anything to help her stand on her own. She and other female characters are basically cardboard figures used to show whether the sterotypic male characters are good or bad. This book is duller than plain corn grits.And the writing...geez...clumsy, thin and the action and dialogue are as cliche-ridden as the characters. This book has the feel of a trashy romance novel. It's so bad it's funny but you might weep over lost time and this book's contribution to the decline of fantasy fiction. Do authors think that the only fantasy readers are young teens? Seems that way given how the books read.Best thing to come from this book is its service as firestarter for my still."
1,same old same old...,"I had heard this was good. Different. Somehow bringing uniqueness to well-worn fantasy ground. Not true. I couldn't finish it. How tedious: yet another quest fantasy centering around fem-jep and rehashing the medieval magic world. The dialogue was atrocious (does anybody REALLY talk like this?), the characters were cardboard (and stereotypical - a double insult) and I was bored bored bored. The only cliche missing was a unicorn.In all fairness, had I read this when I was 10 or 11 and just discovering fantasy, I probably would have liked it. But as an adult, if you've read this kind of fantasy before, there are much better versions out there with a heck of a lot more depth and soul. Don't bother with this one."
2,Slow and Stupid,"I'm on the hundreth and something page(about a third of the book) and NOTHING has really happen yet. Not anything not told on the back of the book. The main character was only in the prologue and then he disappear. The girl of the story was so stupid I don't even want to go into it. Suffice to say that she brought a curse down on herself and got rape without putting up much of a struggle. You can't even say it was a struggle since the rapist didn't get hurt. All she did was tried to push his hands away and then scream when she finally realize what he was doing. I didn't even bother to finish a book with such a weak, pathetic heroine."
3,Too Choppy,"I picked up this book in a used bookstore and began reading it that night. The story line is excellent and I loved the idea of Juilene being cursed and anyone who helps her gets hurt. I also loved the idea of her falling in love with Cariad, a knight from the future. Unfortunately, the ending was way to rushed and left many unanswered questions, as though it was waiting for a sequel. They don't say what happened to him and Juilene, or if he was ever allowed to prevent himself going back. It was choppy and clumsy. The story line was excellent but just didn't cut it for me."
4,Hoping for a Sequel,"This book was great. I literally couldn't put it down. I think I read it all in only 2 nights. It was great. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I couldn't do a book report on it in school. Certain scenes wouldn't have been appropriate for my teacher to read aloud. Other than that though, the characters were well developed, as was the plot and everything else. I found myself becoming Lady Juilene of Sylyria!"
4,A good read,"I really enjoyed this book. Anne Kelleher Bush really developed her characters well, especially Juliene. Juliene just seemed to grow up before my eyes, from dependent noble lady to independent brave songsayer. The plot of Lindos's doom also kept me interested. The way Ms. Bush incorporated Cariad into the plot was excellent. I would reccommend this book to any older kids who are looking for a good read, and I'm hoping with everyone else that a sequel is on the way."
5,"Excellent,excellent,excellent.","Take away the Lesbian themes, and this could be sold as a comming of age and self discovery film. The main charachter the Oyster girl took the journey of self discovery, and survived the pitfalls of life and love, that happen today in the 21st century in straight relationships.Although Tripping the Velvet is a slang term.I felt it was much more a story of survival and retribution.However I am not up on Gay Histroy but I don't feel the ending would have hppened in Merry Old England.."
3,Read the book,"Please read the book first; you will thank me for it later. The movie worked well as a follow up to the book, but on its own it was not enough of the story. Please read the book!"
5,"Tip your hat to ""Tipping The Velvet""","A deliciously wonderful film! A eye opening peek into the unspoken Victorian lesbian subculture. Full of romance, comedy and debauchery. A definite MUST SEE for both lesbians and anyone who loves period pieces."
1,Didn't like it.,"Bad acting, predictable story, terrible editing, lousy obtrusive music, all in all I really disliked this film."
4,Unexpected,I was watching the LOGO network and this came on. I didn't think I was going to be remotely interested in this story and once I started watching it I couldn't break away. It is a touching story of a woman struggling with her sexuality. I found it very enjoyable.
5,"Tip the Velvet and You will Laugh, Cry, & Smile!","I normally don't take the time to write reviews but this movie warrants an exception. I am no critic but I know what I enjoy and this movie was wonderful! The plot is a trilogy that takes you through the romances and ordeals of the lead character Nan. Suffice it to say, the story is very good and the love scenes are very tasteful and very erotic. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The ending is pleasantly surprising...and phrase ""Tipping the velvet"" is explained! This one is a keeper!"
3,Nothing Can Compare,"Seeing the adverts for this mini-series on BBC America got me unbelievably excited. The book, by the phenomenally talented Sarah Waters, was so visual, so visceral, and so vibrant that it practically lept off the page. The characters were among some of the most evocatively described, fascinating fictional human beings to whom I have had the pleasure of introduction. The story is in equal turns triumphant, steamy and tragic. When the anticipation was finally put to rest, and the mini-series was aired, I couldn't help but feel let down. While it was an impeccably constructed production - nice acting, visually enticing, fearlessly provocative - I couldn't help but feel that something was missing. It simply felt thinner, less engaging. I suppose this is to be expected, but I would recommend to anyone considering purchasing or watching this DVD, that you read the book first, and watch the mini-series as a companion piece. You'll be glad that you did."
5,The underbelly of Victorian England,"This BBC TV production is brilliant at every level. It's rich in detail, fast moving and involving. Stirling and Hawes are deliciously sexy to look at, beautifully dressed, and their love scenes are erotic and believable. The narrative had three distinct moods--first the rise of passion and loss of innocence, then the struggle for survival and lastly the birth of maturity and independence. All three were presented with colour and aplomb. I loved the glimpses into the world of Victorian music halls and pubs, and shuddered to remember what life was like for women without means or husbands in a world without welfare. Bravo BBC!"
5,"Is LOVE ""Tipping the Velvet?""","One movie is divided into three stories, about one woman, experiencing the same challenge with different women. Taking place in England, beautiful accent and scenery. Lovely sexual communication, accentuating pleasure with a tease. A must see for one who experiences love on different planes."
5,Charles Dickens Crossed With Rita Mae Brown,"It is Great Expectations combined with Rubyfruit Jungle! This is a fun and moving tale of a woman discovering her sexuality in Victorian England. It has all the evil and redemption found in Dickens' tales, as well as the sexual adventure and heartache found in Brown's stories. I do not think it is a great artistic accomplishment. But it is wildly entertaining and emotionally satisfying. Enjoy!"
3,Girl love,"A three part series from Sarah Waters novel, produced by BBC. Not as powerful as ""Fingersmith"", but still an interesting story. I must admit I am not a fan of musicals, so part 1 and 3 were more difficult for me to watch, because of all singing and dancing. Also, while ""Fingersmith"" lets us guessing about the nature of the relationship between the two girls, here, there is no mistake on what is going on between these girls. Very explicit storytelling, definitely not for young audiences. For audience who likes period pieces, this is an interesting presentation on lesbian love as it may have been a century ago."
3,Not Quite the story I read,"While the miniseries isn't bad in and of itself I cannot really consider it a screen version of the story that kept me reading late into many nights. It seems to be more of a watered down cliffs notes version with added traumas to try and help flesh out the story since most of the defining moments and character development have been cut. The comment that came out of my mouth the most while viewing the DVD with my husband was "" this didn't happen"" followed by an explanation of why Nan was in the situation she was in or who someone was. The screenwriter did manage to leave in almost every sex scene though. . ."
5,I liked this movie alot!!!,"This is a long movie but it's worth watching. It gives a glimpse into Lesbians in the victorian times. There are some sexy love scenes too! The only thing that bothered me is the main character's voice, it sounds weird, but other than that it's a wonderful movie with depth to it. It's very realistic, and I could watch it over and over.....if i had the time!"
5,A sexy good time,"This British mini-series is based on a book I haven't read. It's a series a stories about Nan's turn-of-the-century struggle to become a lesbian in England. It could be a story about any young woman's quest for self-discovery. It's quite sexy and contains nudity and intimate scenes. Apparently ""tipping the velvet"" is a euphemism for something, but you'll have to watch to learn what."
2,Cartoonish and Hokey,"Please, please please do yourselves a favor and get Fingersmith instead. It is infinitely better than this, at times, laughable adaptation. TTV was ruined by a bad script and, I hate to say it, lead actress Rachael Stirling. Not only did she look so completely uncomfortable in her love scenes, her voice was incredibly irritating. I was not impressed with the choices she made as an actor, playing the role of Nan. There are some heterosexual actress who can really pull off playing a gay character. Rachael is not one of them. And she is in every scene. Every moment. The story is told completely through her eyes. It's a shame because this could have been so much better than it was.BTW, Sarah Waters is an amazing writer. Definitely check out her books, Fingersmith, Affinity, and The Night Watch."
1,This Version is EDITED,"I don't know what Bookerone is talking about. I've seen the british version and the american version has at least 10 minutes that are cut throughout the movie. I can't believe that amazon is selling this as the ""complete UK edition"" when it is clearly edited."
4,Holmes and the Mirage,"This book is a welcome addition to the early history of the oil business in the Middle East. It is is also a long-awaited biography of ""Abu Naft"", a New Zealand concession hunter by the name of Major Frank Holmes who played such an important part in the development of the oil business in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Holmes defied conventional wisdom and gained concessions in those countries that the oil majors had shunned - later events proved him right. As a comprehensive review of the story of Holmes, the oil companies and the British authorities on the Persian Gulf, the book is incomparable."
5,Essential for Delphi .Net developer,"The book covers an excellent range of topics. As both Delphi and .Net are large subjects I think Xavier has managed the content very well.The book is easy to read and the examples are very easy to follow.The Delphi 6 Developers Guide on CD is also a nice bonus if you are still developing for Win32 in Delphi 6/7.What I expect out of this type of book is to reduce my learning curve and allow me to start writing programs, Delphi for .NET Developer's Guide has certainly done that for me.If you are going to write .NET programs in Delphi than you want this book on your shelf."
2,Not impressed,"I just wasn't impressed with the book. I'm an experienced Delphi developer and I puchased this book thinking it would show me how to leverage my Delphi skills and learn how to do things in .NET. What a disappointment. After a chapter on using the graphics routines comes a section on Mono then off to a discussion of databases. Not much on creating normal forms apps and many of the code examples are in C# or VB. Even some of the sample Delphi code was for version 7, not even .NET examples. I really wanted this book to get me ready for .NET and instead I merely learned some about the graphics routines and file IO. I wanted more from the standpoint of you're a Delphi developer here's how to work with .NET.Found a bunch of typos also, so I had to really study the book to see what was meant. In one case it says you'd expect to see an 'A' as the result but what you really get is an 'A' - not very useful from a learning standpoint."
4,Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for.,"This is the CD single of Prince's song ""New Power Generation"". It was not a hit, reaching only #64 on the Hot 100. But it is still a pretty good song, although not one of Prince's best. There are four remixes of the song here, which all sound quite different from each other. Note that ""Get Off"" is a remix of ""New Power Generation"", and is not the later hit song ""Gett Off"". ""Loveleft, Loveright"" is the last song on the CD, and it's just an average Prince ""b-side""."
4,language and human nature by mark halpern,"It's natural that a linguist and computer programmer should write a strong book called Language and Human Nature. Mark Halpern provides the greatest amount of information with the most economy of words of any book I've read, sparking my interest to the appendices.The work probes the interrelations of mind, language, computers, and extends outward. So impressed, I sought out and found Mark Halpern scrutinizing, and then eating, a rye bagel at a Berkeley café, and later wrote to others that I had encountered the most sound and challenging mind in the Bay Area.I got the feeling I was being edited as we spoke. Likewise the reader gains a sensation of mind being molded by purpose. The author writes freshly of why some linguists stumble in communication, and insists that language shapes minds to transform society and, for better or worse, alters the course of our planet. All with the written word."
5,Must have for CF card users,"After having been frustrated repeatedly when using cheap multicard readers, I decided that dedicated one card readers were the way to go. The Delkin DDREADER-33 suited my needs admirably. Solid construction yet small enough to be carried about in pocket or laptop case."
5,Great anytime of the day or night!!!,"If I could rate this CD more I would. I can't tell you how long I had looked for the sounds of Crystal Bowls on a CD I could play anytime I wanted. Then I went to one of Elivias concerts and had to have a CD. My first was this one and still is my favorite. When I want to leave my hectic day and travel to worlds beyond this realm I listen to Journey to Wholeness. The gentle vibrations of the bowls take me away almost instantly. If I put it on before I go to bed I never hear the end of it, I just love it. By the way I have all her CD's now and I love them all."
2,unimpressed,"i love crystal singing bowls, but i really did not like this cd. i was looking for a peaceful cd i could meditate with, and found the bells in this cd to be overwhelming and grated on my nerves. i traded it in for halpern's crystal singing bowl cd, which i love, and was exactly the vibe and quality i was looking for."
2,Interrupted Journey,"This would be a pleasant Journey to Wholeness had it not been interrupted by a raucous collage of percussive clattering and clanking. The percussive technique of playing crystal bowls in not conducive to wholeness. There was not any continuous piece which one could listen to without a disruption that was reminiscent of wind chimes clattering in a storm, a telephone ringing, automobile horn blast. This is definitely not ambient, relaxation or meditation music."
2,Not a great book,"This book is written from the heart, but it is very poorly written. It may be helpful for families and people working with children who have spina bifida."
3,Dummy,PLEASE TELL THE PUBLIC THAT THE LITTLE OPENNING ON REAR OF BATTERY MUST TOUCH THE PROBE IN BATTERY COMPARTMENT.
4,Midland AVP-6 Charger Package GREAT BUY,My son had a pair are Midland walkie-talkies his dad had given him that no longer had the accessories or charger. I found this deal including two new batteries so now we are able to charge them (home/car) and work great. This package was $10.00 cheaper than just buying the batteries. Very happy.
1,non working item,"item not working. sent an email after receipt of item. there were no batteries with order, item non working. matter of fact I sent two emails stateing this fact, and had no responce If you can resolve this problem it would be great. My emails were directed to Qmedia, 11/21/08 or thereabouts. thanks, david owen midland avp 6 battery and charger pack for 2way radios 9.99 s/h 4.99 total.... 14.98"
5,it's the journey,"I have studied riding dressage whilst living in Europe and it all seemed so harsh. I ride reiners and have found that my joy in riding ANY horse is the journey. It's the experience of the exploration. Mr. Belasik does a brilliant job of offering a path of learning without absolutes of how one HAS to ride. Also he couples these lessons with stories of his own lessons (life and equine) that then weave a wonderful journey of passions with horses and learning. He shows that to do anything well one must seek out masters in many fields. Many times this proves that learning a martial art, zen, and equestrianship all apply to the process. I find this book a most enjoyable read! I would also like to thank Trafalgar Square for such a high quality book. The paper is wonderful and the text/font most readable."
3,An interesting read but not to learn dressage from,"I enjoyed reading the first couple of books in this compendium. I had heard of Paul Belasik but didn't have any great understanding of who he was or what he does. The first book introduces him and gives some background and a lot of self-musings.The second book, Exploring Dressage Technique, there are some approaches practical training issues based on his own experience and understanding of the masters. He discusses and debates at some length some of the interpretations of various riding aids, especially the seat. There is also some discussion of the problems that may arise and how to address them.The ""Songs..."" work didn't strike a chord with me at all - perhaps I wasn't in the right frame of mind, but it seemed to be a book entirely created out of ego."
3,My Thoughts....,"I have to say that just from reading the book description, it seems a bit weak. I can't say that I would personally go out and buy this book, I may wait until it comes to my Public Library."
4,historical events plus comedy equals laughs!,"After watching the trailer i've always wanted to see this film, after I ordered on Amazon my family, boyfriend, and i were laughing so much, this is the funniest film we've saw and enjoying it."
5,Nice looking watch,Bought this for a person in India to give to her husband while here in the USA. They liked it so I am just going off what they both have said.
4,Engraved Silver Pocket Watch,"This is a pretty watch and very nice for the reasonable price. I bought it as a gift, and my boyfriend really liked it. The seller mailed it quickly and I was happy with how fast it arrived. All in all, I am very happy with the watch. I would order from this seller again and would recommend them to my friends."
4,Beautiful pocket watch,"I got this pocket watch for my husband and he loved it. I had it engraved for free and he uses it all the time. Well crafted, durable watch face."
2,Junk in a nice package,"Transmission is poor, and if it has to be that close to the sender, you might as well just put the main unit it the ""remote"" location."
1,not worth it,Keep having to reset the outside channel and it's not worth the hassle. Wouldn't buy another one if it was only a $1.
4,Great Thermometer,"I gave this to my neice for Christmas and they love it. It has been accurate, easy to read, and fun to use. The remote sensor is great! It's nice to wake up to what the temperature is inside and outside. Works just as advertised -- I'd buy it again."
3,Wireless Thermometer,"I purchased this about a year ago. It is nice to see the outdoor temp when you wake up in the morning, however...The outside thermometer measures about 4 to 5 degrees higher than the actual temp. And the range of the signal is not very strong. It will stop sending the outside temp to the inside unit and will need to be reset if it is too far apart."
2,Temperature is off,"Even though this item is much easier to set and replace batteries, than other units we have had, the outside reading is NOT correct. Tested it with 3 other thermometers and it was off by 3 to 4 degrees. The inside is accurate.I would send it back but my husband loves the inside unit and just subtracts 3 degrees from the outside reading. Go figure!"
3,It's okay.,"The book was exactly what it said it would be. My reading club wanted to read it. I thought it would be a story, but it turned out to be more of a bible study book. Not what I was looking for, but it works well if that is what you want."
1,Not this classic SF collector's cuppa,"I collect and read classic SF...I could not read this book.It's not SF.It's really closer to detective fiction, horror or humor than it is SF.There are some stories about religious themes with priests and rabbis struggling with their issues.There are some about detectives solving time travel crimes, which is great if you're a mystery fan.There are some ironic horror tales sans horror. Predictable, stale and hackneyed.The tone seems to be tongue in cheek, humorous or at least attempted humor.The writing is chatty, clever (I guess) and long winded.If you enjoy Boucher, great, but don't assume you will enjoy his writing just because you read and enjoy the stories of his contemporaries. You may not."
3,Took days to dry,"This caulk is easy to work with, however, it took several days to dry thoroughly. Not sure if that is normal, because this was my first caulking experience."
3,ART IS THE LIE THAT TELLS THE TRUTH,"This is the type of quirky ""Young Psychos in Love"" type slasher film I normally fall in love with. However, that was not the case with this one. In this tale twins who are part time mutes get discharged from a mental institution and end up killing a bunch of people. Angela and Jordana Berliner star as Virginia and Georgia, our two psychopaths. While the acting was fine, their being mute lacked continuity. The script involving their love interest was weak and lacked good entertainment value. Maybe I have just seen too many of these things as this appears to be a ""me too"" quirky slasher.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Angela and Jordana Berliner)."
1,"Lame, Lame Lame","This was the dumbest horror movie ever! The fan club must be very young. The acting was bad the actors where lame, What else needs to be said."
2,Don't bother,"I'm not familair with the universe this series is created from, but I enjoyed the first one thoroughly. This installment is the worst of the entire series. The charachter reactions are completely unbelievable. Almost all the charachters from the first book are merely bit parts. The plot is full of holes, the reactions and logic of the charachters and their decisions make no sense. The book starts out okay, but by the end you will just want to throw it away and curse yourself for the wasted time."
5,Great product - arrived in 1 peice!,"We are very happy with this product. It's a beautiful design, well made and great for breathing a good wine."
3,Dry...,"Majority of the cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol-A which has been linked to cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information. ""Crown Prince"" claims that this is one of the cans which are free of BPA or Bisphenol-A.I consume different fish all the time. This is extremely dry. Low salt with no chemicals, healthy food but regardless it is not as tasty as smoked herrings from Germany. For higher Omega 3 to 6 ratio and vitamin B, I consume Herrings but for high vitamin D and calcium I consume Sardines. I add Tabasco to make it tasty. Sprats from Baltic tops it all since it is the tastiest, healthiest of all. Sprats are only one inch long and I get some 30 sprats in a can. Sardines are not tasty so I mix it with other dishes for its benefits since I care less for the taste of sardines."
5,"Whoa, these are tasty!","I picked up a tin at my local health food store on a whim. Really tasty--flaky, meaty texture--surprisingly low in salt. I'm thrilled to bits to find them here at this price. Great, quick breakfast, lunch, or high-protein snack (19g/tin). These would make a great change-of-pace for anyone on the Atkins diet."
2,Bad Snaps!,I just bought this item for the first time and the pop top snapped off with very little pressure. Make sure you have a can opener on hand if you buy this product.
4,No salt added,"I like these kipper snacks because there is no added salt (I find the phrase ""Low Sodium Added"" unclear)."
3,So-so,"This book isn't bad, but it's written in a choppy style that makes it hard to follow the ""story"" and feel close to the characters. Emma Boudreaux seemed like a ghost rather than a full-fledged person. Also, I felt that I was told about her close relationship to her brother rather than allowed to experience it firsthand. I agree with the reviewer who said this reads like a journal or ""emotional toilet"" of some kind. That said, I do believe Emily Raboteau is a talented writer. I'll certainly read future works by her."
4,Could be of help for those with identity crisis.,"This book being Emily Raboteau's debut is not bad at all. There are quite a number of signs/symbols in the story you should pay attention to. Perspective jumps from one to another, but not really difficult to follow. How the protagonist's brother got into a vegetative state is inappropriately comical, and it's not all that sarcastic either. One of the chapters is somewhat out of the blue and I can't really find a connection with the main plot. The last 1/3 of the book is somewhat pointless in my opinion. Comes off thought-provoking at first but really started dumbing down after 2/3 mark. Character development is somewhat interesting. Events unfold in a natural manner. Emily was able to make the readers visualize. Messages are fairly obvious (one is reminded at the end and another requires some deep thinking). Good read but not a must read.On a side note, it is one of the few books I feel could be turned into a movie. Just sayin..."
4,Pac-Man on Wheels,"I don't care much for racing games, but World Rally is actually fun to play. Children and adults can have playing it."
1,Don't buy this book,"Anyone with some sexual experience will find this book totally useless. I bought it out ouf curiousity and found nothing new and interesting in the book. In fact, I have bought a few books from the same author, primarily attracted by the title, and found none of it worthwhile."
5,great deal!,"The Coby clock radio I purchased was exactly as advertised and exactly what I was looking for. It is user friendly and quite attractive and most of all, takes up minimal room on my bedside table. I love the ""towerdesign"" and the readout is easy to see but unobtrusive in the dark. Overall, a 5 star item."
4,Good for lectures,Good little voice recorder and I really like being able to record FM radio. Although you have to be close to the teacher if you use it for classes. Haven't had any difficulties with it.
3,Good but Flawed,"I bought two of these. It had a wonderful demo music ""African Song"". and the songs loaded well. but it developed the classic snag...that many other buyers have been facing. the MP3 player has stopped working. the voice recording is working fine and the player playes exellent when plugged into the computer but once you try and play it indipendently it ""hangs"". and has to be switched off by pulling out the battery. :(."
4,Great Mp3 Player!,"I recieved this mp3 player for x-mas. I didn't have to read the directions because it's so simple to use. It is hard for me to plug it to the thing in the computer.( of course I'm only eleven so...) Anyways the earphones hurt my ears and often fall out. Another thing I don't like is it always skips in the middle of songs. I like the fact that you can record things, but it's hard to understand yourself. Something I do like is the accesories. It comes with a belt clip and an armband. I don't use these but my dad often borrows it and he finds them useful. My mom uses it too. BEWARE: IF YOU GET ONE BE PREPARED TO SHARE!!! I also recieved rechargable batteries which are a life saver. I would definately recommend getting some. In the end this is a great mp3 player. It comes with a couple minor glitches but nothings perfect. (speaking of perfect please excuse my spelling in this review)"
4,Good value MP3.,"After downloading the latest software from Creative, the player was a breeze to load songs. For the money, it is a good player with an FM tuner."
4,small but good,"This is my first mp3 player and I love it.The reason I gave it four stars is that it took me a week to install it to my windows xp otherwise,it has alot of memory for your favorite music and it is VERY light.It skips around to different songs so you never no whats next."
4,Great Basic MP3 Player,"My mom bought this for me a couple years ago. It's been a great little mp3 player. I use it mostly for going to the gym, so the arm band comes in really handy. It doesn't have a huge capacity (I think I get around 50 songs on it) but it does the job. My only two complaints are that the thing eats batteries like crazy and it's a little hard to scroll through your playlist. Overall though, I've been pleased with it, and would recommend it if you're just looking for something to take for workouts, mowing the grass, etc."
5,"4 Years & Still working, great mp3 player","I've had this MP3 player for 4 years, and it still works, never had a problem. You should probably opt for the higher memory versions since they not much more expensive.Easy to use, can be used as a USB flash drive. Just get the 1GB or higher models."
2,Muvo looked to be a great deal until.....,"This was a great little MP3 player. Great sound, my wife loves the portability in the gym, but after 7 months of normal wear, the display stopped working. Worse yet, I call Creative and they tell me it's not under warranty anymore. They said the warranty was for 90 days!Huh? The rep at Creative said they'd give me a ""discount"" and only charge me $45 to fix it. I asked for him to please talk with his manager about this problem. He said he'd call me back today, but I'm still waiting.Beware ... Creative products look great, they sound great, but clearly they not only don't hold up well, but also don't have the type of support you expect to have from Creative. Sad."
1,Total Piece of Crap,"I have had this player for a little over a year and have hardly used it. It has never worked correctly. When trying to switch tracks, it automatically shuts off on me. Now, it won't even turn on! Unfortunatly, I did not register the product or keep any of the original paperwork, so the company won't do a thing about it. If you have this player, do not get rid of the paperwork!"
3,Great but...,"I bought the 1GB MuVo device last month. I finally love it.But read on...Once I download the software upgrade from creative's web site(it runs on your PC and upgrades the software in the MuVo) and ran it, the device worked (and still works) great! It really p***ed me off that the MuVo really, really didn't work right without doing that. Wow. Go ahead, Creative, ship crap and fix it later??? What about folks who don't realize they can/should/have-to go to your web site and search for a software (firmware) upgrade to make this thing work? The product management team that shipped this device in not quite working shape should be fired immediately."
1,Dead after 6 months,"I have the Creative MuVo TX FM 512 MB MP3 Player. After 6 months of no problems my player just shut off on me yesterday. It would turn on, then after 20 seconds, it would shut off. I swapped out the battery, still nogo. I formatted the drive and tried listening to just the radio, nogo. I loaded the new firmware from Creative's site, nogo. So now I'm stuck w/ a broke MP3 player. Creative wants $50 to fix it. BEWARE: Their warranty is good for 90 days (not 12 months). I went to Creative's forum and it seems that ALOT of people have this same problem but yet Creative does nothing about it.I wish I had bought an Ipod. Creative sucks. Their products work for a few months then crap out on you!!"
1,Immediate Breakdown,"I loved the unit. It just broke right away. The size was great although it is sparse on storagge. However, my rating is based on a 3rd or 4th time usage problem that caused all the music to be distorted and unlistenable.I found nothing about that in any literature on the product and researched online as well. I returned it as a result of never getting it to sound good again. Get something with better reliability as the products are getting better all the time."
1,Creative products are AWFUL,"i have three different creative mp3. none of them operated the way they were supposed. batteries didn't charge, head phone jack loose, didn't work with win 2000."
2,Better by design,"Like most who purchase from Amazon.com I do read reviews and try and help others who may come along. On the plus side I do like the small conveinent size,with easy to use controls. It would be perfect for cycling. I did have two concerns.1. On page 12 of the manual there is a warning notice to wash your hands after use, because you ""may"" have lead contact with the cords. It does not specify internal or external. Based on how harmful lead can be I didn't want to take any chances. I don't think it matters on the size of the product and its components that contain hazardous materials. Warnings are usually there for a reason.2. The Sports Armband has a poor design. Unless you have 16 inch arms than it may work for you. Having to gather the fabric to make it work felt odd and noticeable. As for performance I never go that far."
1,Lousy software,Software caused endless loop of pop-ups when I refused to register the product. The software is a hog poge of various programs loosely put together. I was hard to figure out how to program. Busy a name brand.
1,Very hard to understnd and use,"This MP3 player by Creative was not in my opinion ""consumer friendly"". Actually I would say it was something that could cause a fairly intelligent person to have a nervoous breakdown trying to figure out. I have a Ph.D. and also own 4 computers-so I am faily computer literate and not stupid by any means. I stuggled with downloading a CD of Cher into this device for hours and finally surrendered by returning it.Maybe I need a teenager in the house to have helped me!"
4,Good for the money,"I wanted an MP3 player with a radio for my walks....this fit's the bill, althought I had another one that only lasted about a year. For the money...it's s good little unit but I think the next one will be an IPOD that will hold a lot more cd's and work with my home stereo. I would recommend this to people who want some tunes while working out as it's small and no to expensive if it's dropped."
5,Let me tell you something....,"Creative Labs has outdone themselves this time. The NOMAD MuVo TX FM 256 MB MP3 Player DAP-TD00004 and any other acronym you can cram in there is so WORTH the hours you have labored to produce that multi-colored paper currency. Convienence, Capacity, Ease, FM freaking radio ..If I were to record my thoughts on this device, and I did, they would be located at http://www.iDevelopASP.NetAlways a fan of Creative (SoundBlaster, Audigy, Extigy, MuVo)"
4,Favorite Mp3er for runs,"I'm sad that these don't seem to be produced any longer. This will be my third time owning this particular mp3 player (i have a bad habit of losing them) and it's surprisingly durable. The previous ones survived constant abuse, to include violent drops and liquid submergence. Can't keep much music on here but not a problem if you are primarily using it for running. Belt clip rocks. Thanks!"
1,Not worth your money and time. Don't purchase,I bought this unit when it was so much more pricey. I used it for a little while and then the usb connection was broken or without making contact. I sent the unit in for repairs and it came back fixed but to it was broken again a few weeks after. Worthless piece of equipmment.
3,Not too impressed...,"I've had this unit for almost a year, and there are things I like about it and things I don't like...Pros:-good sound for the small size-good price-easy to use-I like the clip; I can prop it up on my desk.Cons:-battery life is nowhere near 15 hrs-when I do change the battery, it resets and I have to skip around to find the song I was listening to.-putting it on shuffle or skipping through uses up the battery more.I am planning on getting a SanDisk with a larger capacity; I am hoping it will work better for me."
4,A good little player.,"I chose this player because all I wanted in an MP3 player was for something I could sit back and listen to between classes, and maybe catch some news on the radio. This is what I got in this compact and affordable unit. It serves it's purpose, which is play MP3's for the uninitiated, and it does it well. The radio would be a nice feature if I could pick up more than two stations, though I live in a more rural area so there is not much for it to pickup on.Overall, this player does its job and at a nice price, well worth the buy."
2,Really need improvements,"The battery cap is extremely fragile. It breaks easily.I bought three MuVo to my daughters and all of them are broken. They aren't kids anymore.At least, the gadget works fine but you must update its firmware or it will stuck very soon."
2,Battery Life - Unacceptable,"I have used the MuVo TX FM 256 MB for several weeks now and find that it does everything well except that battery life has never been more than 2 hours. I have bought the best batteries available, not used the variety of functions available on the unit and the result is always the same. Two hours or less battery life. I've even used the ""monster"" batteries that are made for digital products. Support from Creative labs has been a series of nonsensical emails that were obviously written by High School dropouts. I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
1,Theoretically wonderful product - If it worked!,"It seemed like a wonderful product. I loaded mp3s and used it a few days. I put the unit away for some time. When I tried using it again, the unit would not power on. Tried new battery, of course. It only works as a thumb drive now.I have read many forum posts describing this same problem. It is clear to me there's some design flaw. It is also suspicious they would offer only a 90 day warranty. Fixing it now would not be worth it given its low price. It is the size of a disposable lighter - but I though the similarity would end at that."
5,Can't skip? Read the ONLINE manual!,"A previous review said that you couldn't skip to the middle of a song with a MuVo. Not sure what the reviewer meant by that, but you can fast forward or reverse within a track by holding the jog wheel in the forward or reverse position. This feature isn't mentioned in the skimpy Quick Start guide that's included with the MuVo. To learn about all of the features go to Creative's website and download the complete 75-page user manual."
3,Not much for the price,"Not much to this book. Any clever DM who takes a second to sit down and think about ""Backdrops"" could do the same thing in 15 min to a hour. Now if you are caught in a tight spot with the players wandering to unplanned places this is a good tool. But, because it is only 30 odd pages and each encounter takes up 2 pages, 1 map page, 1 text page, after several uses this item will be back on amazon. Hold it a sec! In that case buy mine when I sell it."
3,32 pages pocket book,"If you are going to opera show, and Tannhäuser is the piece; get it: read it before the play, write your impressions in the latest blank notes pages along the representation and use it after it to share your notes with friends."
3,Good purchase if you've seen it already,"If you watched the Berenstain Bears Christmas special when you were young, you will not regret purchasing the DVD just for the dancing Christmas Tree song (""We Need! A Tree!"") and to see Papa Bear get those ""crazy eyes"" again, then shed a tear when he looks in at the snowbird family's house (and yes, you will probably cry too). However, the quality of the DVD is not great. I have warm fuzzy memories of this classic, so that doesn't matter to me. But if you have no emotional attachment to Mama, Papa, Brother and Sister Bear, you might be disappointed with the quality."
5,Frustrated and MAD!!!!,"We need ALL of these great Berenstain Bear stories, especially the holiday, on DVD!! PLEASE!!! These lesson-learning, wholesome stories are ageless and priceless. My girls loved them as children and now that I'm about to be a grandmother for the first time .... they are very limited or not available at all! Hope to see the holiday stories on DVD soon."
5,Great holiday dvd!,I got this for my grandson before Christmas! He loved it! I hope it becomes a traditional movie for he and his brother!
2,Get the book instead,"Childhood nostalgia saves this from being revealed for the shoddy adaptation that it really is. If you're a fan of the books, trust me, the artwork here will turn your stomach. And what is with the sleazy song and dance numbers? It's a nice book but don't subject your kids to this video. It'll just make everyone uncomfortable."
1,Old collection passed off as new -,Don't be fooled by the Berenstain Bears title. This is recycled from the 80's. It is old animation and very tedious background music. My 5yo picked up on the old style and old voices. The episodes only very slightly follow the books. The fist episode The Christmas Tree is more like a rip off of The Grinch than anything else. Don't waste your money. Borrow it from the local library and review it before you shell out 11 bucks for it.
4,Very Solid Spellcraft Resource,This book is well laid out and provides a huge amount of useful information in an easy to manage order. Great book to have in the practitioner's library. A very positive energy inspiring book. I highly recommend it.
4,Very informative,"I was really pleased with this book. It is great for beginners to get a real handle on what spell crafting and casting is all about. The author really explains well the uses of spells and I felt like I actually learned and understood meanings and purposes. There are a few spells which are really good, but if you are looking for a book of spells, this is not for you. This book explains and teaches you how to cast and craft your own, and the many ways and processes of doing so. I enjoyed reading the book and actually learning more about spells!"
4,Great Book,"Perfect for putting things into perspective with easy to interpret information, not to mention the cover looks pretty sick. I'd recommend it to anybody with interests in this field. Some of the spells they give you in the back though are a bit hoakey, but the information is well stated and explained."
4,A good book to begin with,"I think this is a good starter book, and that being what I was looking for. It is perfect for me.. I like the book easy to read and understand."
5,Empowering and Enhancing your life,I found this book to be very informative. There is good information for anyone to use to empower and enhance their life. I highly recommend this book to anyone that's in need of empowering their life for the better.
3,Not the most comprehensive book on kitchen gardens,"For those who want their vegetable gardens to provide bountiful harvest as well as being aesthetically pleasing, the kitchen garden is the way to go. The addition of flowers and other non-vegetable plants add colour and dimension to a garden that would otherwise be fairly mundane and drab. As the book discusses, there are essentially two kitchen garden traditions: the English and the French (Potagers). Aside from the short discussion on these two variations, the book contains much that is familiar to any but the most novice gardener. The latter portion of the book is devoted to recommended varieties of vegetables for five basic growing regions of North America. While I always find such overviews interesting, in my opinion it diminishes the usefulness of the book."
1,This CD Sucks!,The celebrities who covered these songs can't sing at all. Every song sounds terrible compared to the original. Save your money and don't buy this.
4,Very Good,"There are some beautiful and meaningful songs, that are real uplifting prayers, My favourites are number 2, 4 and 7.The CD brings all the lyrics enclosed."
5,"""Embrace""",I love this CD. It brings me peace and is excellent for meditation or just a peacefulsurrounding. I would recommend it without reservation.
2,Nothing transcendant about Deva Premal...,"If you like music to relax to or read a good book to, then this album might be appropriate. However,for music that would be useful for meditation or trance work, this or any album by Deva Premal I would not recommend. Her songs are repetitive and uninspiring. And given the album covers and pretense of mantra chanting, this is not ethnic to say the least. I'd recommend Russill Paul's yoga cd's instead."
2,unchristian lyrics,I love the music and I love the singing but the lyrics are very unchristian. I might like it better if it was instrumental only. Oh well.
1,Disappointing,"I found this disc disappointing compared to Deva's brilliant first CD entitled The Essence - which is a must have. What seems strange to me is that she is on the inside cover touching Buddha's chest, while the first track sounds like make-out music. Hmmmm.... For what it's worth, an Indian Brahmin confirmed that some of the mantras are concoctions, too, which does not really set a good precedent. People copy Deva's chanting in their kirtans and in this respect her work is influential. Although being innovative can be commendable, spiritual traditional chants are, in my opinion, off limits for whimsical changes. I wish she would get her mantras from reliable sources in the future.Hard core Deva fans won't notice, of course, and will love this."
3,differential instruction,Good book for a student or someone new to differential instruction. I found it to be mostly an overview of concepts.
1,I agree,"I do have to agree with my fellow emerson colleague on Deluca. His books might be ok, but he is not the best teacher in the world. I took a few classes with him, and I thought he was a regular lecturer. After having graduated from emerson and gone off to grad school, I have come to realize that there are far more intelligent and less arrogant and aloof people than him. I think he should stop hiding behind his degree and books and become a better person. The greatest people I have met in life, have been the most humble people. Deluca IS NOT a humble person."
1,review,I am also a student at emerson college and I have to disagree that Professor Deluca is a good professor. He is impartial and displays favoritism. He is also extremely arrogant and he talks down on people. We all might not get doctorates from Stanford in our lifetime. But some of us do look up to him and yet he treats us badly and does not gives us a fair chance.His books are just as dull as his lectures.
1,Terrible Teacher!!!!!,"De Luca thinks he know averything about life. He hurt me really badly when I had ensued all my trust in him and he never apologized. He yelled at me in front of everyone and when things resulted to not be true he did not even apologize. He used to be my favorite teacher, but his attitude broke my heart."
3,Unreliable Provider,It took them four days to tell me they didn't have it in stock. I ordered 10 for my daughter's birthday favors. Very disappointed and frustrated to have to reorder and hope it arrives on time.
2,Cute little Blues,"This Blues Clues is not really a toy, but more of a beanie baby. Our little 3 year old granddaughter loves it. When she watches tv, it comes out with her and sits right next to her. Its very soft and shes likes to hug it."
4,We love Blue!,My daughter is two and absolutely loves her Blue! She's small enough to take with us anywhere and never gets left behind at home! The product smelled horribly when it arrived. It smelled very strongly of rotting carboard or something. I threw it in the wash and the smell was gone.
4,We LOVE Blue!,I bought this for my 2yr old grandson. He is a huge fan of Blues Clues. I made him a Blues Clues basket for Christmas and this was the centerpiece. Blue has become his favorite plushie! He takes her everywhere with him and gives her lots of hugs. :). The toy is well made and has survived the extreme affection of a 2yr old. It has also kept him interested when a lot of his other Christmas toys have been forgotten. Good job me!!!
3,Ok- I ordered it thinking it was something else,"I feel, frankly, a bit dumb- but they have changed the photo since and it now clearly says it is a Ty Toy, before it appeared to be a stuffed animal and much larger. Firstly, the toy appears to have a frowny appearance and doesn't have the smiley expression blue always has on the T.V. Anyone who ordered this before the picture change probably expecedt it to look different!"
3,toy,"we got this , it was smaller than excepted .... wish it was bigger for him ... paid too much for it for being small"
1,AWFUL!!!,This was the nastiest tasting product I've ever put in my mouth! Very bitter and chemical taste. NOT a sweet or natural taste AT ALL!
3,I'm all for stevia but ...,That stevia is cheap but have an strong aftertaste. The best stevia I have tested so far is Pure Stevia Extract plus Luo Han (made by KAL). It is more expensive but I find it worth it. Absolutly awsome and zero aftertaste. This should be recommended to diabetics rather than the nasty and toxic nutrasweet. No one does it better than mother nature.
4,Very good.,"Although it is rated yuri, it's more shoujo-ai (A mild version of yuri) but that doesn't take away from how utterly cute this series is.The story begins with Aoi Nagisa transferring to an all girls school and meeting the elusive and beautiful Hanazono Shizuma, the Etoile of the school. It starts to introduce more characters and not just one but a few love triangles begin to form. The 100% girl cast keeps you in the moment of this and they are portrayed realistically than most yuri animes.For fans of yuri, I would consider this a good buy."
2,"A lot of pseudo erotic, but not really much to get excited about.","I went into this movie thinking (like most guys) that there'd be a lot of physical relationships between women in this film, but the reality is that it really just teases you throught the whole film. It constantly plays the interruptus eroticus over and over that eventually you know what's going to happen soon after an intimate scene begins. Added to that, the overdone, submissive, neurotic girls gets to be a little bit annoying. Rent this first from Netflix before you buy and judge for yourself. Even though I personally am not a fan of this, I hope that you may enjoy it."
2,Lezbian Interest - Not Too Interesting,"Lesbian interested fans only really apply here, the rest may find this drags quite a bit. This one of the only anime I have watched where it was so boring I actually stopped. Initially it looked interesting, and I thought I might even find the gay women thing interesting, like Nana, but this is just uninspired and gets old real fast. The character set up is cool and at first you think it might be good, but oh boy... yeesh, really dry, but I did like the visual character of this one head school girl with big gray hair. The end credits have live action girls dancing like embarrassed zombies, and live footage in anime always detracts from the experience."
5,love it!,"This is a beautiful watch. The features are a bit odd. Like the large second hand on the dial is really the stop watch hand so it never moves unless you start the stop watch. And the split timer does not work on mine. The actual second hand is in one of the little extra inset dials. Luckily I don't need to use it to time sporting events.It's a casual sporty watch. Even though it has diamonds I don't think it crosses over to elegant or dressy.I have a very slender wrist so it just about covers the top of my wrist. Its the third watch I ordered, all the others were way too big. On a more normal sized wrist it will appear more dainty."
3,Not Sure if it Works!,"I heard about the product from a co-worker who swears by it. He told me it helps him prevent colds and gives him energy. So I said, ok lets give it a try. I do not like the size of the softgels. They are huge and I had a hard time swallowing. The instructions indicated that you should take about 6 softgels the first time and reduce it to 1 or 2 a day after that. Frankly that is a bit spooky for me. I took 2 the first time. Perhaps that is why I do not feel any different. I actually had a bit of a stomach problem after taking the gels but can't determine if it was something else I ate."
1,Rip Off,"I received this book quickly but there are many missing pages, often at critical points of the story. So far pages 65,243,273,270 through 181 are missing. Many of the pages have distorted scans. I have never purchased a product from Amazon of such poor quality. I highly recommend readers find another source for this book."
4,What Do Women Want?,"Ostensibly a book about the growth of the sumptuous department stores in Paris, ""Au Bonheur des Dames"" is also an insightful, and astonishingly prescient essay on the role of women in modern society and the degree to which they are turned into the commodities they are enticed into coveting.Zola's scientific gaze is sharp and mercilous; and even though the book is a much ""happier"" look at Paris in the Third Republic than most of the other Rougon-Macquart novels, it is nonetheless a sobering, sophisticated dissection of nineteenth-century capitalism at its most rapacious and seductive.This is a book that could easily fit on reading lists in Womens Studies, Economic History, or Modern Literature."
3,"awesome product, but be careful!!","I have clogged kitchen sink and pulled trap apart to clean out the clog. No success with wire hanger. I used the drain king which seemed to be working really well. I hade wife turn up hose slowly so I woulnt have any blowback. After about 60 seconds, there was water gushing from the side of the house adjacent to the line. Apparenltly I blew a drain connection somewhere down the line. Had I had a plumber come out to snake the drain, I doubt I would have ruptured the drain line somewhere in the walls.If you have an older home and are not aware of the integrity of the drain, you may want to carefully consider using this product.If you have new plumbing and are not worried about it, this thing is extremely effective."
4,"3"" and no larger",This works well but is definitely not for anything any larger than 3 inches in fact 3 inches is pushing it...it does hold together much better than the ones with no brass on the end...
1,Drain King,"I used this to unclog my pool pluming. Forget it. It does not have the power for this job. Maybe it works on sinks ok but not on pools,"
1,Total waste.,"I bought this product to clean a clog in a 2"" pipe. Regardless of whether I turned the water hose on slowly or quickly or moderately, the Drain King never expanded. All the water just flowed back past it. I tried everything. Finally when to the hardware store an bought a flexible snake. Problem solved."
4,drain opener,"Bought this for opening air conditioning drain lines and have only tried it once. It will probably clear most clogged lines, but you may have to cut the line to use it, also it does not send a large volume of water through the line, it does send a steady flow through the line. I installed a 3/4 pvc union into the line for future easy access."
3,Drain King,I bought this device. I have not used it or tried it. I hope that I don't have to. I saw one in use once. The one I saw worked fine. I am rating it 3 just to get this persistent request for a review to go away. I hope that I never need it.
5,For wind lovers...,This is a wonderful collection of Nielsen's wind compositions. A must for wind lovers.
3,Its. . O. K.,"I don't like how the book is set up, I can't tell where one topic ends and the next topic begins, I can't wait to done with class and done with book.I dislike how long it took for the book to get to me and even then I had problems obtaining the book. I'm not sure the seller required it but the book needed a signature on receipt and I was in class. I live in an apartment and I guess my leaseing manager signed for it and then denied that the book had ever arrived and eventually I got it but it was such a hassle and what a nightmare and ugh"
5,Doc at his best!!,"This was my very first Doc Watson record, back when it was nearly new! It was then, and remains now, my favorite all-time album. The personnel are like a who's who of Nashville in the late 1960's. The songs are top rate, this version of Shady Grove is still the best ever. Doc didn't draw lines between old-time, bluegrass, country and western swing. It's all country, and it's all good. Buy it!!"
5,Remarkably valuable sourcebook,"I don't imagine that anybody but students of the Modern Middle East or the Islamic World would find this useful, but for specialists in the field, this is an exceptionally valuable text. There are several points to commend this particular compilation. First, the introductory essay is very good. Second, the range of readings is geographically and topically broad. And third, one can search for essays both by region and by topic. It is an easy source to use for classroom study.For those who don't have a significant background in the field, this work is likely to be unsatisfying, consisting largely of readings from 19th and early 20th Century Muslim intellectuals. For those with more than a passing interest, this collection certainly gives a sense of major issues and perspectives and would make a good companion to secondary source readings."
2,religeous surprise at the end,"We checked this book out at the library not knowing that it was going to give ""God"" credit at the end. There is nothing on the cover that indicates any religious prejudice. The story was good up until the last few pages. I don't want my child to trust God to take care of him as this book suggests. I know I can't protect him from such things always, but it would be nice if there was some sort of warning on the cover of such books that are marketed to children."
5,"Sensual, complicated, beautiful","If you're looking for pretty, nature, Haiku-esque poetry, then this might not be for you. Many of these are graphic sexual depictions. Many have four letter words. Ikkyu, aka Crazy Cloud-- Zen Monk, Enlightened One, Patron of Whorehouses, Virile and Active into Old Age.But don't think these are just sex poems. These are poems built of a version of primary colors: light, dark, mountains and wind.There's a Whitmanesque Bullheadedness and Joy of Life to many of these short poems (most 2 lines long, rocking back and forth in their sliding images and rhythms) but you don't get the tongue-in-your-ear feeling that comes with reading Leaves of Grass.Whether he's telling you about burying his pet sparrow or going down on a woman in the kitchen as she cooks, Ikkyu rewards the reader again and again."
5,My two-year old daughter loves this book.,"My two-year old is fascinated with this book, and has been for months. The ""fire dogs"" work very well for her because she is interested in animals like most children her age. The fact that the fire fighters are dogs adds a playful element to the book. She loves to say ""Whoosh"" when she sees the hoses at the beginning and end of the book. She also likes the middle two pages which must be turned in a vertical orientation -- once this is done, a scene is revealed that is more dramatic than the rest of the book due to its larger size. From my own experience, I think this book is very appealing to a young audience, and conveys the spirit of fire fighting with as much detail and accuracy as is called for at this age."
3,Adapter modifications necessary,"This adapter has to be modified to work. It is fine electrically, but it ""Will Not Fit"" physically in either of my two compact flash readers.The problem is the Height of the adapter is larger than a normal XD Card.For one reader I had to remove the top label on the adapter. On my other reader I had to Grind Down the front of the adapter at an angle. (on the top above the contacts of the adapter) **Now it's fine**-----Hope this helps others----- Sincerely, Ralph"
1,Mac Users Stay Away,"This is the second Delkin adapter that I have purchased that does not work with OSX as advertised. (The PCMCIA Cardbus CF Adapter does not work either.) This XD Card Adapter works fine for Windows XP or Linux but, when used in either a Lexar or Sandisk CF reader with a Mac, it will corrupt your card. I was able to download the images from my XD card but, after I ejected (unmounted) the media and put it back into my camera or another computer the card was not recognized and had to be reformatted. Maybe it is me but, this is not my idea of compatibility ... having to reformat my media each time I download pictures."
3,"Works with with PC, NOT with Epson P3000","I bought this to use with the Epson P3000 and my Olympus Stylus 790SW camera. It works fine on my CF card reader for my PC, but unfortunately it does not work on the Epson P3000. All was not lost, the Epson can use the USB connection to connect to the camera and download images that way.So, it works just fine on my PC, but not at all on the Epson P3000."
1,It cannot be plugged into my card reader,"The adaptor cannot be inserted in the CFII slot of my card reader - HD (Digimate). Only a few times, pressing hard in certain angle I got to read the xD card keeping pressure during the transfer process."
2,Overly Hyped,"I check out a lot of WDW Guidebooks, and this is just another one. There is nothing here that sets the book apart from others. Cute ""ears"" awards instead of ""star"" ratings??? Access to there special website with tips on how to smooze a cast member into giving you some knock off discount?? Almost sounds like one of those late-night TV infomercials for a real estate buying course!If you want real info, what shows to see, rides to skip, Rita's book doesn't give you that. How about all those money saving deals? Well look, any tourist place in Florida has these nifty little racks of flyers and coupons. Way more than are stuck in the back of this book.This book is not one I would recommend at all. Try the PassPorter guidebook. It WILL show you how to save time, see all the good rides, skip the bad ones, etc.Don't waste your money on this fluffy book of ""Areo'isms"". You'd be better off asking Mickey Mouse himself to show you around the park than to follow Rita's advice."
2,Falls a little short,"I had bought an edition of Rita's four years ago. So I decided to buy a newer version for my trip this year. However, there seems to be less information than in the older one! Many things are glossed over and require using the older version to refer to in order to complete the picture. The book also promises a great website, however, when I went to the url listed in the book, there was no website! :(All in all I prefer to use Birnbaum's coupled with the Disney Magazine in order to keep up to date. If you've visited WDW before, you won't find anything useful in this book."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!false advertizing,"I bought the first Rita Aero book in 2000 and loved it I especially loved the website. IT was informative and good reading. SO I got itfor my trip in 2003. Well,they would not give you access to the website even though you purchased the book and they claim it makes the book invaluable right in the book. they make a huge point that this is why I should purchase this book over the others. When you try to log on you get a message that the website refuses you access. ...Well fine but don't advertize in your book the website. I will return this book and write the publisher..."
1,This book made me want to do Universal instead,"After reading this book I had to ask, has the author been there in the last 5 years? This book is very outdated and was an unintelligent read."
1,Much better available,"This latest edition is very similar to the previous one. The writing is at points poor, and the material not presented in an engaging manner. The maps I found overly simplistic, and the promised web site access has no updates now and is often impossible to reach.I recommend: ""Passporter Walt Disney World: The Unique Travel Guide, Planner, Organizer, Journal, and Keepsake!"" ""The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2003"" ""Birnbaum's Walt Disney World"""
4,Must have reference book,The only reason I give this book a 4 star rating is because of the information that was removed from fourth to fifth edition. To serve as a complete reference you must buy both editions. The topics covered are significantly different.Excellent books. Must have for any person involved in Printed circuit board industry.
2,Not for designing PCB,"I bougth this book to have a reference on the desing of PCB. (How wide to design the traces, what distance should i use betweeen traces...) I found it prety useless.Nevertheless, it is a goog book to undestand the process and manifacturing of PCB, if this is your business"
3,old edition,"This was a good book for its time, but published in 1984, it says little about the recent history of the denomination, which has been rocked by controversy over the issue of gay ordination. There is a more recent edition, written by James Smylie, copyright 1996."
3,Plenty of action and tension,"Released from prison, Steve (Kirk Douglas) is tempted to perform one last seemingly impossible heist. Eschewing the offer from notorious gangsters, he pairs up with an agile trapeze artist met in a street fight and plans a concurrent FOOLPROOF alibi and perfect crime. Unfortunately, fools are involved which leads to three brutal fights, one exhaustive car chase, and more than one vendetta to be settled -- leaving Steve to wonder if the effort was equal to the potential payoff. Be careful about making friends with acquaintances met in an alley.Caveats: Image of this made-for-TV production is VHS quality on the DVD. There may be too much violence for some families."
2,I was there at the making of the film,"My name is Carlos Rosaire, I am a Circus Artist and at the time of making this film I was performing in the Circus Orfei in Rome where the Circus shots were filmed, one of my family actually appeared in the film, after the film was completed, I saw the version in Italian and I very disappointed in the version that Amazon sent to me as it had been cut quite a lot and most of the scenes that I was looking forward to were missing, apart from this it was still a very good film, it was with great joy that I saw my old friend Giuliano Gema again, I have not seen him since the film was made. I hope this has been of some help to people who will have seen the film or will be doing so in the near future. Yours Carlos Rosaire Spain 28/09/2012"
2,Not like the others in this series,"My family has loved all the history ""news"" books in this series. They are witty, clever and full of excellent information on the period they cover.Sadly, this book is nothing like the others. It isn't witty and clever but didactic, heavy handed and preachy in the way of a dull textbook. It really shouldn't be sold as part of this series."
4,A good laptop roller bag / laptop,"Just got this bag this afternoon and transferred all my ""junk"" over to it. It has just as many compartments as my old laptop backpack. I was a bit surprised that there wasn't more padding and support for the laptop compartment, but it is adequate for my IBM T43. I wouldn't check it as luggage at the airport, but it should be good for the daily commute to and from work."
5,An epic adventure,"DON'S NAM, ""about the beginning of the end of the United States involvement in Vietnam from a junior officer's perspective on a conscious and subconscious level,"" bristles with passion, compassion, wry wit, and plainspoken authority. This powerful and original portrait of one man's odyssey is filled with selfless acts of bravery, outrageous shenanigans, extraordinary courage, and insightful wisdom. Rast's voice is as eloquent and compelling as any that has yet risen from the ashes of the debacle in Vietnam. Rippling with authenticity, Don Rast's DON'S NAM should be on everyone's top-10 list of ""Must-Read Vietnam War Books."" An epic adventure, Don Rast's DON'S NAM should also be on every Hollywood director's top-10 list of ""Books That Would Be Great Movies."" Sincerely, Diana Dell, author, ""A Saigon Party"" and ""Memories Are Like Clouds."""
1,Sucks from the first frame.,"When the main character first appears, she has a phony, stupid smile plastered on her face as 2 men tell her stories of her father and then she is seen with various dates where she blabbers out stupid banter and the men quickly get turned off and ditch her. So, from the start we have a main character that is so obnoxious and phony to the audience so that we are quickly turned off to the whole movie in short time. Not a way to start a movie. I did not even want to wait and see if the character would eventually figure things out and seem likable, or at least tolerable, which I doubt she did. A failure of a movie. Do not waste your time, there are many better options."
4,"Yet another Boston medical thriller, but better than most","Dr. Maura Isles returns home from a medical conference in Paris to find a crime scene in front of her house. Oddly, however, her neighbors look at her as though she's a ghost, and when she sees the victim in the car she learns why: the dead woman is nearly identical to her in appearance. But as the police investigation progresses, it turns out Maura and the dead woman have a lot more in common than just looks - birthdates, clothing preferences, similar careers, and both were adopted. But why was she at Maura's house and why was she killed, and more importantly, was she really the intended target?Yet another medical thriller set in Boston hospitals and deals heavily with medical examiners and autopsies (see also ""A Case of Need"" and ""The Patient"") but this one is better and keeps you turning the pages. The ending felt a bit rushed, but overall a good book, although 4 stars is maybe a bit too high - call it 3.5."
3,"Fun, But Not Her Best","Gerritsen makes a smart move to base this novel on the forensic pathologist instead of on Jane Rizzoli. Jane's just a bit too brash and annoying to make the reader sympathize with the protagonist.The plot is not quite believable, and the villain, when revealed, is a surprise--but she/he is such a minor character as to render the I-never-would-have-guessed factor somewhat artificial. Dr. Gerritsen has a nice story-telling writing style, and her characters for the most part are likable and human. Their vulnerabilities help bring them closer to the reader's level, and it makes a series of novels possible and interesting.I guess my main objection to this novel is the plot. It just doesn't seem believable, and it doesn't grab you with its teeth and refuse to let you go. Gerritsen is capable of such storytelling, and I hope her next installment in the series takes us back to such edgy plots."
4,Great Read!,"I have become a huge fan of Tess Gerritsen. I read the Surgeon, The Apprentice, The sinner, and now Body Double. The only problem with her is that she doesn't come out with new books quick enough! Her stories with characters such as Rizzoli and Dr. Isles are hard to put down. I can't wait till Vanish comes out!"
2,disappointing,"I wanted to love this book, but I didn't. The ""hook"" of a body that looks just like the heroine, Maura, is a good one, and I expected to explore more of the depths of Maura's background. However, both the explanation of the ""twin"" and the emotional resonance are not satisfying; the treatment of both seems to be superficial. Beyond this, the investigation of the crime and tracking of the killer had little challenge to it. And to me, the ending was a letdown"
5,Body Double,"The TV series got me interested in the books, and I've read the first 6 books so far. Body Double has been my favorite so far. I couldn't put it down; scary, creepy, interesting. Love this book!"
5,My Favorite Tess Book out of SIX,"I finished this book last night. Wow! What a page turner! I have read six books by this author and this was in my opinion the best - which is saying a lot because I thought very highly of ""The Surgeon"" and ""The Bone Garden.""Body Double is a work of create genius because it starts out about plotline #1 and then veers over seamlessly to plotline #2 so deeply that you almost forget about #1 until the story is almost over and then BAM!... you get plotline #1 straight in the face. A third plotline is expertly weaved in as well. You almost feel like you're reading three different books and when you see how they are all connected, you have to admire the forethought that was put into all of it. Highly recommended!"
4,Brilliant,"Picked up The Surgeon last week, read that, thoroughly enjoyed it, went to the library and got this one out. It's a fantastic read, scary and atmospheric. I love how vulnerable some of her characters are, Maura being divorced and 40, Jane being pregnant & Mattie, with her rubbish husband. With Patricia Cornwell, all her 'good' characters are so strong, scarily efficient and capable, but TG's are more real, I think."
5,I could not put this book down,"It just keeps on getting better ,now on to #5 love them all so far!!!"
4,Gruesome but gripping!,"'Body Double' starts off with Dr.Maura Isles finding a woman who looks exactly like her, shot point-blank in front of her house. With Detective Jane Rizzoli's help, she begins digging into the woman's - and eventually, her own - past.Gerritsen starts off with a plot that doesn't seem to have much room to grow but surprises us with the path she takes it. The book is filled with several twists and surprises and has a feverish pace that has us turning the pages from start to finish. Even the romances are low-key and never damage the pace.That said, the book is not for the squeamish or easily grossed out readers. Gerritsen's descriptions (for instance, of autopsies) are detailed and the crimes in the book are of a very ghastly nature. But she manages to throw in something positive too and the chase that happens towards the end is both wonderfully written and has a climax that delivers a very warm feeling.Overall, 'Body Double' is a gripping read from the ever-reliable Gerritsen."
4,Great read,Fast moving and interesting. I would recommend this book if you enjoy this genre. Keep these great reads coming. Good work.
2,"Gripping, awesome","I read this non stop, and liked it so well that I had to order the rest of her books as i had never read her before. This was a well written convoluted, complicated book, just absorbing!"
2,Not a Writer I'll Read Again...,"Sorry, I'm just not a fan of Patricia Cornwell wannabes or their genre on the whole. When someone tells me,""Read this book. You are going to love it,"" I'll read it because ""I'm going to read something"" anyway. I can't return this one fast enough. (Either that or throw it in the canal!)Far from sqeamish, I'm not a big fan of books about burying people alive, or cutting babies out of mother's wombs. ""Gee, is that just me?""This book is more like a lame Creative Writing project for a Graduate course in college. Pregnant cop hunts killer of someone who captures and kills pregnant women. Old man has ""Barbie"" trophy wife. Two detectives, divorcing, are caught in squabbles of jealousy. Only one will survive! Yikes! How orignal!Keep your Tess Gerritson, Dean Koontz, Patricia Cornwell, James Patterson books. I don't need them. I suggest you don't either."
3,same ole thing,My 1st Tess Gerriston book. Although I liked it it seemed to be the same thing. The twin aspect of it though put a twist into it but it was a pretty predictable book. If the next book I read of hers is as bland as this one I'm done!
