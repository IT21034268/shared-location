1,You have to be and I mean have to be ....,"a major kink to enjoy this book, which ranks pretty high up there on the publisher, Blue Moon' books, for the strange.OK so if you read the ed review and see 'this man who provides them with prolonged spasms of ecstasy' then I guess it would kind of conjur up the eroticism of the moment, but, when you read the book, and, by about the third ,Mr Merlin spits into Janice's face and then 'she blinked,but said nothing, feeling the sputum slowly sliding down her cheeks'.Yup, the books says cheeks, plural, wow ...just to think about it .... yeeeeech, well enough said about that ...Anyway, the rest of the 192 pages of the book we find a lot of women getting spanked and whipped, and, the oddest thing (if there can be something odd in this book) before the women get whacked, the whacker adds up the number of strokes she is going to get, based on imaginary infractions.Maybe accountants would enjoy that but I sure didn't ....."
4,Good to get you started,"The book is clearly written. Not much API discussion, but it walks you through a simple stock price lookup example. Most chapters build on this theme - adding errors, database and so on.After about a week, you'll be ready for the next book. But at least you will be able to get a struts database application going."
5,Very clearly presented,This book is as good as the other book (Mastering JSPCuston tags and tag libraries) written by the same author. The material covered is very clearly explained.
2,It's already outdated.,"Struts 1.1 is shaping up to have so much different from 1.0 that it feels like this book is already outdated.DynaActionForms, a feature of 1.1 which may end up largely unused (but which I think will in effect boost dev speed by 50%) are not covered AT ALL in this edition.I would recommend this edition of the book only for the purpose of getting familiarized with 1.0."
3,Good basic information but missing Struts 1.1 topics,"I found this book to be adequate for understanding the basics of Struts. The book states that it describes Struts 1.1 which is the new beta release, however many important topics are not covered. There is no mention of DynaActionForms and no information about using the validator which is integrated into the Struts framework. Both of these features are great time and code savers. It does describe the RequestProcessor which is new to Struts 1.1.Overall, this is a good intro to Struts but lacks some very important information about the new features of release 1.1."
2,Not impressed...........,"The material is written in a clear and understandable manner. It does cover the BASICS on how to develop a Struts application. I CANNOT BELIEVE that this book does not cover DynaActionForms, Validator, or Tiles. These are very much a part of Struts 1.1. I think that the book was written for 1.0 and was slightly modified to incorporate some of the new 1.1 features. This is yet another book that feels they need to spend some 40+ pages on an introduction to Servlets and JSP. Combine this with the 80+ pages of Tag Library Tables in the back.... The book discusses various open source tools, such as SQL and Tomcat and then spends a whole chapter on how to embedd Tomcat into JBuilder(???). The book only covers the basics of Struts and does not cover anything like performance issues or integrating Struts to some sort of Model like JDO or EJB's. Programming..."
1,Waste of time,"This is a managerial-level overview of Apache's Struts Framework. When trying to learn how to actually develop an application, I found this book to be completely useless. Buy the O'Reilly book or Husted's instead to get a real guide to Struts that will actually help."
3,Not Quite a Must Have,This highly anticipated book by a well respected author was pretty much a big let down for me. I expected more details and examples on how to use the Stuts custom tags. It looked like he just reworded the Sun specification and examples. I would not recommend buying this one.
1,"Wouldn't pass for a ""Learn in 24 Hours..."" book","This book is in a word, awful. In attempting to learn, let alone master, the use of Struts this book is as useful as a paperweight. While I am an experienced J2EE developer I do not know the ins and outs of Struts. Unfortunately I made the choice to this book to correct that shortcoming.The technical errors in this book, in the text and the examples, cost me hours of time on a personal project. I eventually had to use the Struts documentation to figure out where the problems were. That isn't a bad thing, it is a sad statement on the book.But it wasn't all bad - the page numbers match the table of contents.At least the bottom of the barrell for Struts books has been reached and can only improve from here. Save your money and look for another source of Struts information."
5,Very pleased,"I'm very pleased with how this book goes way beyond the docs. It demonstrates how to build two complete Struts apps (a stock ticker tape and a employee contact database). The explanation of the design, implementation, and deployment of these apps was enlightening (so was the code itself).I cannot udnerstand why the Struts docs only has one page on i18n when its supposed to be one of the major reasons for using it. This book has a whole chapter which is very useful. The practical debug material is great. This book covers a lot of topics that as of today are still marked ""TODO"" in the Struts docs like ActionServlet, RequestProcessor and extending ActionForm.This book didn't cover every Struts tag but it hit the ones I use the most. The info is much deeper than the docs and corrects errors in the docs!This book came along at exactly the right time for me. I'm very pleased!"
4,Solid stuff,"Good solid Struts advice in this book. Much better written than the docs and more useful. I like the well rounded approach to the topic in this book..refresher on servlets/JSP, Struts framework architecture, good practical tips on error handling, etc. and a complete application to see how it fits together, and tag ref. I liked this approach a little bit better than the one Cavaness took on theserverside.com (his author bio said this will be either a Que or O'Reilly book, not sure). His first two chapters are even more basic, covering a lot of elementary Web programming concepts.Only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't cover DynaActionForms, even though they aren't strictly necessary and it does cover ActionForms. Still great stuff and written at the right level. I don't feel talked down to or lectured at.I definitely recommend this book."
3,Struts for Beginner,"The good thing about this book is it does make it easier and simple to understand Struts. Due to its simplicity, I think the title should be changed to ""Beginning Struts"" instead of ""Mastering"".The bad thing about this book is it has lots and lots of repetition of codes, as similar codes printed again and again, and the last four chapters that acts as reference for the tag libraries have lots of attributes with the same explainations repeated again and again.Gee..Thus I said it's good for beginner as u'll never get lost. As you flipped over the pages, you'll feel like hey..I've read something similar to this..well, coz it's repeated dude."
5,Great resource,"Having only the documentation that comes with Struts, I found this book to be extremely helpful. I, an experienced J2EE developer, have been haphazardly desciphering Struts parttime for the past several months. In one week I skimmed through the book, worked the entire Employee Directory example and have a new found understanding of Struts. I still have a ways to go, but this book was an efficient way to learn the basics."
3,good introduction book to start with struts,"If you are new to struts, or even Java servlet and JSP, this is a good book to begin with. The author has done a great job to explain the whole thing step by step. Chapters are well divided and each one is very precise. However, there are some sample codes are missing. Also the example only works for struts 1.1.I changed my rating on this book now because after I actually used struts, the information provided by this book is not enough and for sure you won't ""master"" struts."
2,Reguritation of free documentation an major errors,"To start with, this book was missing several pages. It started with the TOC page VII with the first page referenced being 142. Hmm, seems like if I look at the page numbers the first page is not 142 but 1. Any decent editor would find this major flaw. The other problem is that you can get the exact same information going to the apache jakarta struts website and downloading the docs. If you do not have web access or if you are reading while away from your computer then this could be an option."
3,Simple and outdated,"This is a quick read on struts. By the time it came out, it was a little outdated and some of the code did not work. The concepts were described quite well and example that did work were well done. This is written for struts 1.0 and not 1.1 and definitely not 1.2. Find this one at the outlet bookstore or buy it used if you think you really need it, or better yet, borrow it from a friend."
3,Good starter book,"If your new to struts then you may find this book helpful. Particularly when it comes to configuring the Struts framework for use. The book touches upon everything you will need to get started in Struts, configuration, Actions, ActionForms, etc.. but doesn't go much beyond that. I've been working in Struts on and off for about a year and I find I use this book only for reference when trying to tweak a configuration. For a more in depth loook at this terrific framework, I would recommend Ted Husted's ""Struts In Action"""
2,Naperville IL,"Since this is the only available book currently on the Market on the Struts Framework I will rate the book as an ok introduction on the Subject.The book is by no means a ""Mastering Series"" as the title indicates.Coverage of overall Struts Framework in there but barely, I feel the books lack real detail and is at best a Quick Start to using Stuts."
1,Don't buy this book!,"This is just another example of the way James Goodwill writes books lately. They are rushed out and lacking critical information to be useful. If you are going to be using Struts, you WILL have lots of questions that are not answered by this book. Don't waste your money on it or any other book by James Goodwill! I have a two of them and they both really bad. Sorry James!"
4,PLAY's Greatest Hits,This CD was awesome and i would recommed this CD to any fans of the band PLAY. I love listening to all there music because it has a great beat and you can even dance to the CD.
5,Great for any Play fan,"I think that this CD is great for any Play fan. The songs that are on it are:1. Us Against the World2. I'm Gonna Make You Love Me3. Hopelessly Devoted4. Let's Get to the Love Part5. Girl's Mind6. I Must Not Chase the Boys7. Hot8. What Is Love?9. Another Love Story10 Ain't No Mountain High EnoughWhat is wierd is that the song ""Another Love Story"" first appeared on the CD ""Don't Stop The Music"" with the new group member Janet, but on this CD, Faye is singing the song (as well as the rest of the album) with Anais, Rosie, and Anna. I personaly think that the song sounds better with Faye, although I have nothing against Janet. Either way, this CD is worth buying."
1,Not what 'All I need!',I loved the commericial...all I need...then I got the cd...When I got I thought it might be ok...turned out it wasn't all to good!If you like simple bubblegum pop this album is for you; otherwize no offense fans; this album ... and is not for you!~Beth
1,worst cd ever,"Honestly, this cd is terrible. It isn't just the cd but it's her voice. It's so irritating after a while. I went to school with this girl and she use to be the really sweet girl, until she started to become famous. Her attitude is the worst and maybe that's why I hate her cd so much. Haha. So why do you think no one really knows her?"
2,Eh,"Luckily, I wasn't the one who bought this CD, a friend did for me. The only songs I enjoy are Romeo and Love & Faith & Inspiration. The other songs are just too slow, and some are just annoying after awhile. The CD isn't worth how much people pay for it, but Romeo is a great song. Lindsay can sing, theres no doubt, she just needs better material."
3,Bubble gum pop gone bad,"There are only two good songs on this CD, the rest is the same kind of pop music you'd expect nowadays. When will the hit the 99 cents bin?"
4,"Fast shipper, as described","Fast shipper, as described . . Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described &. ; Fast shipper, as described"
2,barely interesting- Buy the book instead,"I feel this movie was a waste of money after reading the book. If the titles were hidden, I would never have known the book was related to the movie. The novel deserves 10 gold stars."
5,"witty,fun,great simple classic entertainment","i saw this when it first came out and liked it alot its funny, whitty ,adventurous, keeps you wondering whats coming around the corner next,fantastic period detail .its a story about a loser and his maybee daughter who got a bit higher i Que than he has at times all the caracters were great especialy mrs. tatum . happy to say i just found it and bought it"
4,Funny and Charming Road Movie,"I recently watched for the first time Peter Bogdanovich's early gem (how could I miss it?) with the family team, Ryan and Tatum O'Neil, and fell in love with this charming and touching road movie/comedy that takes place during the Great Depression. Tatum gave, perhaps, one of the best performances by a child I've seen for which she received the Academy award as Best Supporting Actress. Her Addie is almost never cute (even though she could be when she wanted to) but her Addie is very smart, very observant, and much better ""con artist"" than ""professional"" Moses Pray. It was sad to see how talented Tatum was and how her career went nowhere after this triumph. Madeline Kahn, as Trixie Delight, the seductive lounge singer and P.J. Johnson as Imogene, 15 years old Trixie's maid are delightful.4.5/5"
5,A road picture with a twist,"A wonderfully entertaining movie set in the 1930's in Kansas. Ryan O'Neal plays a two-bit con-man who gets roped into transporting a 9-year-old girl (played by his real-life daughter Tatum) to relatives in St. Joseph, Missouri, after her mother dies. Tatum is wise beyond her years and the two team up in scams on the road. They have their adventures and grow to love and need each other. It's a fun picture, with the '30's setting perfectly captured in music and great b&w photography. Tatum won an Oscar. Definitely worth a watch."
4,LOVABLE TUMBLEWEED,"I was 12 when I first saw it at the movies in a little town in Georgia, and the sight of Tatum in a tank top sulking and pouting and smoking naturally stole my heart. But it's her dad who steals the show here. He nails every scene just right, especially once he takes up with Miss Trixie. (""We're just givin her a ride, that's all. She has a high school diploma!"") Apart from sassy badinage between the ONeals and Kahn, however, most of the dialogue is stilted and the movie sputters along just like Mose's old Model T. It's a slow-moving film by today's standards, and not afraid to let silence to the talking from time to time. Why do I love it? Prolly because it feels right for its time and place. It's like a tumbleweed blowing across the road, in a small Midwestern town."
4,Comedy and Drama,"I haven't played this tape yet, but have seen the movie elsewhere several times. Good story line and character development."
5,Paper Moon Rating,A true Hollywood classic! Ryan and Tatum O'Neal are fun to watch and are a perfect pair. As well as Madeline Kahn for supporting actress. She brings her fine assets to the big screen. Great fun and a timeless classic.
5,"""Pray Tell. . .""","No matter what we think of the personal lives of Ryan and Tatum now, (none of our business, anyway) there can be no denying that this Father/Daughter team could act--and what-on screen chemistry they project. Their expressions and timing are amazing as we imagine them using their real lives as valuable experience for the roles. The whole motley crew is entertaining. Con man, standoffish and manipulative young female offspring, exotic dancer, Trixie Delight, played so well by Madelyn Kahn, the bickering of young Addie and Trixie over ""possession"" of Moses Pray, the rich textures of the rural Thirties landscape. It is a beautiful, beautiful and humorous movie. I wish the father and daughter could have given us more of this wonderful stuff over the years."
5,Blue moon,"This is truly a work from the heart. A true family affair, as father and daughter work as a team to bring a real uplifting, and occasionally very sad, story of a man who needs a woman to share his life. Little does he know that that the woman would turn out to be a little girl. A little girl that he 'may' have fathered without his knowledge. This is filmed entirely in black-and-white and is carried out so perfectly that the vintage look is right at home. A simple, subtle movie with some hilarious moments including a lusty Madeline Kahn. I've been a fan of Tatum O Neil since 'Little Darlings' stole my heart many years ago. But, upon seeing this movie, which was made before Little Darlings, i have to say i am now an even bigger fan. A truly beautiful and talented actress. An honest and sentimental film for all ages."
5,Watched it being made,"This early 1970's wonderful movie was partially filmed in St. Joseph, Missouri where I lived at the time. My house was about 3 blocks from the Holiday Inn where the entire cast stayed. Town people would go to the motel to eat and walk around the lobby just to see the cast. Tatum would be running around and frequently Ryan O'Neal, Sybil Sheppard,and Peter Bogdonavich would be eating in the dining room. It was a fun experience while living in a midwest town.A wonderful, classic movie that will live on as one of the greatest!!!!"
4,Endlessly appealing!,"I have loved this film since I saw it at the age of 7! Tatum O'Neal is wonderful, as are all the cast. Kudos to Madeline Kahn and Ryan O'Neal. Great nostalgic atmosphere. I loved the 30's tunes and 'Jack Benny' off the radio. The character of Imogen is a hoot! There are so many great scenes and quotable dialogue (""Yes, Miss Trixie"", ""This little girl give me a fi' dollar bill and I giv'er change!"", ""Of course ya' know everything is in the bone struct'cha...""). I never get tired of seeing this one!"
4,Adorable!,"I have a 2 year old daughter and she loves to read. These devotions are great, they are short enough to just keep her attention. I love the fact they have a very small one or two line bible verse and prayer at the end. They are short enough that I will have my daughter repeat them after me! If you want a great little devotion that teaches about God for your little one, I highly recommend this!!!"
5,Daughter looks forward to it every night!,"My 2.5 year old loves doing her devotional and looks forward to it. I especially love that each message contains a scripture, a prayer and plenty of interactive questions."
5,Love this devotional!!,I love doing this devotional with my children. Their ages are three and five. They can understand and relate very well to the devotionals. So far we I am very pleased.
4,Great little devotional,"I ordered this when my daughter was 4 and wanted something that could focus our mind toward God first thing in the morning. I was surprised to find there to be quite a lack of material out there for this age level (most seemed to be either a baby picture book or something more in-depth). This proved to be just the right combo. Not too short, not too long...just right! The illustrations are beautiful (done by the illustrator of Care Bears, I believe) and often capture my daughter's attention. Love that they include a verse and a little prayer. Super!"
5,Our whole family loves it,"We love this devotional . Simple Christian principles, catching little stories. Designed for preschoolers but our 6 year old enjoys reading to me, our preschoolers enjoy answering the questions and our baby loves the pictures :) great resources for reminding us who created us, and why we should worship Him and how we should love his people."
5,Daily Devotion for Preschoolers,"This is a wonderful tool to help teach preschool age children about being a loving, kind, person. We use this each night at bedtime and my daughter loves the pictures and stories about the kids. There is always a message involved. Sometimes we talk more about it, sometimes we don't have time. She is 5 and working on memorizing Bible verses for Sunday School and preschool, so I like to read the passage that goes with each message. We then say the prayer in repeat-after-me style. I am getting this book for all of my Godchildren. As I said in the beginning, it's a wonderful tool to help teach God's love."
2,"Fits 4x5 Graphire as well, construction quality iffy, though","I primarily use my Wacom Graphire tablet to incorporate hand-drawn notes into my otherwise typewritten class notes. I purchased this case to help protect my tablet while in my bag traveling from point A to point B.While the sizing and inner 2 pockets work great for my Graphire (as I'm sure they would for an Intuos of the same dimensions) the zippers are sometimes sticky and at one point the teeth behind the zipper separated in the first week of use. I was able to backtrack the zipper and so far it has been okay, but this does not bode well for long-term durability.Finally, the outside padding is fairly thin -- I think it's made of neoprene or the equivalent. So the main benefit of the travel bag seems to be protecting the surface of the tablet, but not as much for protecting the tablet itself from bumps."
4,Good Notebook for the price,"This notebook from HP is geared towards the entertainment. The display is excellent and offers a good entertainment experience. Comes with webcam integrated for the video chats and have LightScribe enabled burner (along with the software) which helps burning images with the same laser on to the Lightscribe compatible CD/DVDs. The 2GB RAM is good in providing a good Windows Vista Aero experience. It runs without any hitch. On the down side, the included battery life is terrible. It doesn't stay for more than an hour. This notebook also heats up badly. I wouldn't recommend this for heavy use. Also, the Wifi option included (Broadcom) isn't compatible with my Linksys WRT54GL router.Weighing the pros and cons, I think this would be a decent purchase if the purpose of your purchase is entertainment and you aren't intending this for everyday heavy usage (as in the case of mine)."
3,Sharp edges- Fisher Price should know better!,"I boought these cars a month ago when my daughter turned 6 months old. She wasn't too interested in the stacking aspect of the toys, but they were easy for her little hands to grasp and she was intrigued by all the colors. My daughter is very active and always reaching for things no matter how far out of reach. Last week the biggest of the cars (the fire engine) was upside down on the floor. My daughter was sitting in my lap while I sat on the floor and lunged for this toy falling forward with her mouth open. The roof of her mouth was cut open by the surprisingly sharp edge of this toy! Needless to say they promptly went in the trash! Fisher-price should know better and have rounded edges on all of their toys! If you buy these toys and you have an active infant/toddler watch out for the two bigger cars as I realized too late- the edges are very sharp to the touch!"
4,Great Toy together or separate,"My now 1-year-old has loved these vehicles from a very early age. When he was just a couple of months old, he liked watching us take the little green car and move it back and forth on the tray of his swing. Then when he was old enough to hold it, he loved to hold the little one and shake it (it rattles). He still zeroes in on that rattle. Now he likes to crawl around running the cars on the floor. And, he'll sit and just move the wheel on the top of the police car for what seems like a long time as he watches the colors change. Don't wait to open this one. It's useful from very early on."
4,Good toy,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little. She really hasn't been interested until recently. Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top. She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn't stack them or nest them very much. I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn't really used them for the intended purpose. I don't think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn't take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows. They are extremely durable."
5,A favorite of my nieces and nephews!,"These cute stacking cars were very popular with all of my nieces and nephews, mostly when they were in about the 9 to 18 months age range. The large size of the cars makes them perfect for little hands to grasp easily, plus they roll smoothly and stack snuggly. They are also bright, colorful, and very durable, even after getting thrown around a lot! Highly recommended and a great first birthday gift."
5,One missing from the nest!,"The Nesting Action Vehicles were purchased as a gift, but it happens that one of the vehicles was missing, which wasn't reported to us until recently. Up to this time, have always found Fisher-Price to be right on the mark for quality, price and reliability."
4,Okay toy,"My son plays with these cars to some extent everyday but has never really gotten the concept. He has never stacked them or nested them, even after countless attempts at showing him how they work. He does drive them around and his new thing is bringing the car to mommy so mommy can run it all over his back. It's a daily routine that he looks forward to. Maybe someday he will get the idea on what they are actually for."
2,My 9-month-old showed no interest in this toy,"I thought this was a cute idea. Perhaps my baby is too young for this toy at 9 months, but she showed no interest in this toy whatsoever. After 2 weeks of ignoring this toy, I returned it to the store. The car on top never stayed there, it seemed to fall off the top way too easily. These seem cheap and are hollowed out cars that do not roll well at all when compared to the other Fisher Price cars for babies. The paint comes off easily, which seems very dangerous for babies, who put everything into there mouths! I can not recommend this toy."
2,Wheels don't roll,"What good is a car that doesn't roll? The wheels don't roll well, so my boy has moved on to cars that actually go..."
2,Clever but not much fun to drive,The cars are hollow and thus too light for my 10-month old to roll properly-they just flip over. I would go with something heavier that handles better around curves.
3,Fun for the little ones,Lots of fun and different ways you can use these for teaching - colors - numbers - size. Great toy.
4,Fun Cars,I really like these and so do my kids. They like to roll them around as well as nesting them. The only thing that could be improved is for there to be 5 cars. 4 is just kind of a random number to teach a young child to count to.
4,Fun toy! My kid loves it!,"Got this for my son when he was about 13 months. He loved them and he still does (now 18 months old). He was quite amazed that the cars can be stacked and also nested. He learned to push them around and pretend that they have engines. We are also trying to teach him colors using the cars (red, green, blue and yellow)."
3,Mom likes it better than baby!,My son has had this toy for about a month and a half. He's nine months old and really doesn't show that much interest in it. I think it's an adorable toy! Each car has a unique feature and the stackablity is great!
4,This is a really cool toy,I just got this for my 7.5 month old son. He loves to push them and really enjoys the fire engine's ladder. The small one is good for chewing on.=) This is a fun durable toy!
1,The Paint Comes Off of the #2 Blue Car,"Fisher Price Should be ashamed of itself! This is a toddler toy and everyone knows that toddlers put toys in their mouths. There's a white roller thing on the top of the number 2 car (all the cars have something different to play with on the top of them). Unfortunately, the top part of the blue car is white because it's painted. I found my 11 month old baby had white paint chips all over her mouth after sucking on the top of this car! Yuck! Also, these cars have stickers on them. You can forget about putting these cars in the dishwasher if you want the stickers to remain on them. The concept of these cars is brilliant. They stack. They come in different colors. Each one has a number on it. They roll. It's too bad that children can eat the paint off them. I consider that to be a serious problem with this toy."
2,Kind of a boring toy,"Neither of my boys, ages 3 and 1, take any interest in this toy at all. I bring it out and show them the different things it can do and they still don't find it interesting. It could be an educational toy if you can get your kids interested in playing with it. I tought my boys would be because they love cars. As far as being durable it hasn't broken yet, but that could also be because it has not been played with."
3,more cutesy than fun,The trucks were played with more for their ability to drive around than as stackers. Not very impressed.
4,Great toy!,"My son has had these since he was 6 months (he's 21 months now) and has loved playing with them since then - first to bat the little car around, later to nest them, and now to watch them crash into each other or take drives over the furniture."
4,This toy lasts,"My youngest boy got this toy as a gift when he was 7m old. He and my 3yo have had a lot of play time with it as a stacking toy, and as regular cars to drive around. My 3yo loves that it has a fire truck and a police car. He also likes the numbers on the side and the different colors that he can identify. My 1 yo loves putting the ladder up and down and all the other movable parts. If you want a toy that you won't have to put away because your child outgrew it in 3 months, this is it!"
4,Pretty cool hidden cars.,"I got this for my one year old. He wasn't really interested until 18 mos. He can push, cover and extend the ladder on the durable cars. He even takes them in the tub. I think its a pretty neato car set for the $$."
2,Made a mistake with this toy,"I bought these cars for my nine month old thinking she'd like to roll the cars along the floor and nest them inside each other. She only liked the smallest car (and for only a couple of minutes) which was easiest for her to pick up and rattles, unlike the other vehicles. She hasn't looked at them since the day I bought them so they have been given to her grandmother in hopes that she'll find them more interesting later on. The vehicles don't do anything besides roll IF you push them (they won't roll on carpet if you don't continue to hold onto them and push). The idea behind this toy is good but I didn't think they were very fun either so I can't recommend this toy. I think the box for this toy said six or nine months and up, but I think perhaps it is a better toy for older toddlers, not babies."
3,shake rattle and roll,these car are fun for the older child I say 1 and over. my son just turned 1 and all he did before this was to play with the smallest car that rattled. now he will try to stack them. as for the numbers we are just starting out learning these so maybe In a few months he will figure out that you can stack In the number order the colors are nice and bright but they don't really move all that well as to playing with them.
4,Simple but fun,"I like this toy but more importantly, my five month old son likes it. The toys are sturdy but lightweight so he can pick up the big red fire engine and put it in his mouth. The stacking and nesting features are fun even at this age as he can knock over the stack or lift the fire engine to find a NEW toy!!!! He seems to love it and I am very happy I bought it."
4,Cute...,"My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now). The small car is nice for babies to shake. They don't do much, but they are cute."
5,Went through three kids with this toy and it is still going strong!,This is a great learning toy. The cars can be stacked up or nested. Hours of fun for the little ones. ;)
5,Big Hit!!!,"My son got these cars when he was 7 months old, at 16 months they are still and tried and true favorite. Because the cars nest inside each other they are very portable, always in our bag for road trips. When we have friends over, even the 5 year olds play with these cars! Definitely a big bang for the buck."
5,Greatest toy ever!,"My daughter was just learning to play by herself, we bought her these cars simply because of the bright colors. Much to our surprise, within 2 weeks, she would not leave home without them, and crawls around to push them!"
4,LOVE THIS TOY!,I bought this toy for my son (9 months) for Christmas! He loves it. My other two children like playing with him with it!! It's super easy to store as well as they stack into one another.
3,Stacking & Nesting Cars,"My son started playing with this set of toys when he was around 1, but he's never shown a lot of interest in them. Now almost two, he can nest the vehicles in one another, but it's difficult to stack them on top of each other. You have to be pretty precise. He likes pushing them around when he does play with them, but that's about it. They're very durable, as they've lasted through a few mini tantrums."
4,Girls like it too!,"My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab. The bright colourful colours really held her attention. When she was sitting we played the ""Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down"" game and ""peek-a-boo"" with the smaller colours under the bigger cars. They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething. At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over. She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game! Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers. Good value!"
3,Very Durable - Spuratic Play,"I bought this for my son when he was a year old - this was the time he was putting stuff together and I though that he would love this - not so - he played with it for about 2 days and rarely played with it after that. Now that he has just turned 2 - he's starting to play with them again by ""vrooming"" them around the house and crashing them together. Very durable - they have been stepped on a number of times (they hurt) and not even a crack!"
4,A good value,I have three sons ages 18 months to 4 years and they all play with this toy from time to time. We have had it for over 3 years and nothing has broken and that is saying alot because my kids are very hard on toys. They like alternating between nesting and stacking and using the cars as cars. It doesn't absorb their attention for too long but for the money they have gotten lots of play value out of this toy!
5,This is a great toy!,"My son got these cars when he was about 10 months old. He is now 20 months old and still loves to play with them just as much as when he first got them! They teach so many things! At first he just liked to push them around. Then he soon realized that they could ""hide"" in one another. A couple of months ago he found out that they could stack on top of one another. When he was about a year old, I started to show him that the cars have numbers on them, so now when I say ""Bring mommie the number 2 police car"", he runs over and gets it! About a month ago he started working on holding more than one car in each hand, which is possible if he gets his little fingers in the holes in the top of the cars! He also loves to face them all the same way, end to end according to size! All in all he still plays with them for hours on end!"
5,For girls and boys!,"I bought this when my son was about 6 months old and it was one of the best toy purchases I've made. My son is now 1 and still plays with them. His babysitters son (who is 13) said he wished he had a toy like this when he was younger! My nephews age 4 and 5 also love to play with them. My son loves knocking them down but also is learning colors and what each little car is (taxi, Fire engine, etc...). And when I am in need of a small gift or something extra for someone ...I buy this inexpensive toy and I always seem to receive rave reviews from the moms! I even bought them for a few little girls who enjoyed them while playing at my home. This is definately a fun as well as educational toy."
2,Nesting cars,I thought it was an neat ideal but my grand kids weren't impress with it. I guess you have to be in your 50's to think it was neat.
3,new twist on stacking cups,"my brothers like to play with these stacking cars. they can drive them or stack them and hide them under each other, they also have little pieces that move around."
1,No interest for tot,"This was a Christmas gift when my son was 9 months old. Still, at 19 months he has no interest in these cars. I thought he would love them since he loves stacking & nesting blocks. Boy was I wrong!"
4,Great toy for children,"I bought this toy for my son at Christmas time when he was just seven months old and he loves it. The cars and trucks can be stacked on top of each other or inside one another. His favorite one of the four is the fire truck. It makes a ""clicking"" sound when you raise and lower the ladder. Great fun for the baby, easy to store in the toy chest or travel bag."
4,"Great ""Boy"" toy","We bought these cars for my son, Andrew (7mons) for Christmas. They stack on top of each other quite well. He loves knocking them over. Drew watches them intently as we move them around. They are very sturdy and colorful. They have endured many bangs and falls. It was the best ""boy toy"" we bought him this year."
5,Great Toy!,My son's therapist brings this toy over and he just loves it. He loves to move the ladder on the fire truck up and down. This is one of his favorite toys and he doesn't play with a lot of baby and toddler toys (gets bored easy).
2,fun but no durability,"I purchased this item for my boys' birthday party. My boys and their friends absolutely loved it and had so much fun. But within a few hours, the boogie board had a hole in it. The tubing around the pool area also has a small leak. Sometimes the slide and pool come apart if my kids went down too ""hard."" One more negative is my 2 1/2 year old isn't quite big enough to jump up to the height of the slide. He just needs to grow a little but he still had fun with it. If the product could be made out of a more durable plastic then it would be so worth the money."
1,Don't buy the Cannonball Water Slide!!!!,"I want to warn everyone, this product is crap!!! I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for her Birthday, she was so excited, it looked great when it was setup and within an hour of her using it and I mean going down the slide maybe a dozen times, the pool started losing air from a whole somewhere. My daughter weighs maybe 58 lbs, this item should be able to hold children....TAKE THIS PRODUCT OFF THE MARKET, ITS A WASTE OF MONEY!!! I ONLY WISH I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS ITEM!!!!"
3,Great backyard Toy,"Great for kids of all ages, easy to use.The only downside is the alignment of the Velcro that connects the slide to the pool is off"
3,Fun but not long-lasting,We just bought this in June and my 4 and 6 year-old sons got two uses out of it and now two of the compartments have holes somewhere that we are not able to find and repair. Fun toy but not durable enough.
1,Cannonball,The kids have fun as top of the slide is approx. 2-3 ft high so they can run and jump onto it BUT......the slide is a separate piece from the pool so it is almost impossible to keep the two hooked together which means (a) a parent is constanty pushing the two parts close together so the kids don't go head first on the ground in between the two parts and (b) all of the wather that squirts out of the slide runs down the slide and onto the grass instead of into the pool as the connection between the two is so poor.
2,Fun toy - punctures quickly,"I bought this for my 6 and 8 year old boys. For the first use it was great. We've used it 4 different times and we've head a new seam puncture after each use. Patching the seams bandaids the problem for that use, but it continues to deflate. It's a fun product but due to the poor durability it will not last for next year."
1,TERRIBLE!!! DONT BUY!!!,"I bought this for my kids and it was TERRIBLE!! I set it up..and the first time they tried to go down it, it tipped right over on my 3 year old. You have to stand and hold it as each kid goes down. The sprinkler hardly works so the slide doesnt get very wet, which makes for no fun!!! Havent used it again..they would rather jump through a sprinkler then try this again. DOnt waste your money. When the company contated me they said I could return it..but I had to pay for SHIPPING!!! Just dont do it!!"
2,IT TIPS!,The idea of this slide is awesome! Even the pool alone is nice. But everytime my daughter tries to use the slide it tips to the left and she goes off the side before making it to the pool. It's in no way dangerous...but the slide is not sturdy at all! We had to prop two lawn chairs on either side of the slide to keep it from leaning to the side. Once we did that the kids had a blast...but clearly too much work for something that should be more simple! Great idea though! My daughter still loves the pool :-)
1,not worth it!,"We bought this Splash slide in hopes that it would give our kids (ages 9,4, and3)lots of fun, but unfortunately,it only lasted so little time. first, the slide part ripped so we had to use it as a regular little pool. then, the pool ripped where the thin plastic is joined. I am talking in about 2 weeks period. honestly, it is made out of cheap, thin plastic that it is not mean to last."
4,Splash Bomb,"Dear Customers,If you are looking into buying the Splash Bomb Slide, it's a great way to have fun. But I wouldn't reconmend to anyone over the age of 8-9 years old. It's kinda small but it's perfect for yor backyard and a great toy to use over the summer."
2,Somewhat pleased but smaller than expected,"I have 4 yr old twin boys and they enjoy playing in the slide, but the attention span doesn't last for long. It is smaller than the picture (big surprise). The slide stays attached as long as it is used properly, when my kids started to crawl from the pool to the slide it comes apart but they just reattach. Overall the best thing I bought for my kids was a 6.5'x4.5' rectangle pool they have more fun with that than anything. If I had to do it over I would not purchase the splash bomb - but would instead get the bounce and splash slip n slide - they played on that at a friends house abd the enterainment value is better."
2,Lots of fun if you can get it to blow up...,The pool/slide was pretty fun once I got it all blow up. But by that time the kids were already bored and moved onto something else. Even with an electric pump it took me over and hour to fill with air. The numerous air holes are so tiny that you have no choice but to sit and wait. Maybe an air compressor would have been more helpful?
1,top rail did not inflate at first use,The top left rail did not inflate at the first use of this product. Disappointing and now have to go through trouble of seeing a refund.
1,Terrible product!,"This is one of most poorly constructed water toys I can imagine or have ever seen. My 4 and 6 year old barely lasted 10minutes with it - the pool at the end is way too short, the slide attaches to the pool in one of the most poorly designed ways, velcro on top. As the kids slid into the pool, the small velcro adhesures came undone everytime. Often, the whole slide would tip as a child was going down it because it is poorly balanced - the water runs on one side making that side very top heavy. Then, by the end of the afternoon, both pieces had holes in them and deflated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and think Banzai needs to hire new engineers for their products in the future."
3,great for cooling off but the slide is off balance,"We live in Texas and are in the middle of a drought and heat wave so this is a great way for the kids to beat the heat. However, the slide part of the this is heavier on the side that the hose connects to and therefore it tips over to that side all the time. We have to put things under it (a noodle works great) on that side to keep it balanced. I had to keep replacing it for the kids and they got frustrated with it toppling over with them on it. Also, I wish a pump was included in the box. The slide part requires ALOT of air that is too much by mouth."
1,Fell apart,My son played with this for one day and it already fell apart. He is really upset. THANKS ALOT!
1,Banzai Cannonball Splash Water Slide,"This Water Slide was fun while it lasted, however we were only able to use it once. The second time we set it up and connected the hose the part were the water sprays out of poped on the inside and caused the right side of the slide to fill with water therefor making the slide unuseable. It is unfixable cause its on the inside and paying how much we paid for it is not worth only one day of play. I wouldnt recommened buying this product."
1,"WASTE OF MONEY! CHEAP, BROKE WITH SECOND USE","Please do not waste your money on this cheap piece of junk. I will be boycotting banzai products from now on. It is badly engineered with the drainage right by the slide entry into the pool and WILL cause injury. The slide doesn't stay put and keeps flipping over. The water springs in the wrong direction on the slide. The seams broke on us with the second use.Banzai won't replace the product unless it is within 30 days and requires your receipt. I tossed my reciept after I used it once since in their instruction manual, they tell you that the store won't accept returns after you have used it. I contacted them after my second use resulted in the broken seam. Now they tell me the return is dependent on the store's policy. Anyways, I was stupid to have tossed the receipt and to buy this piece of trash but I hope you'll be smart and not purchase it."
2,Fun while it lasted,"I bought this water toy a week ago, My 4 year old and some of the little neighbor kids used it for a few hours and had a blast! A couple days later they wanted to use it again only to find the the slide had a gaping rip in it, right ona seam. No patch kit came with the toy, so we used one we had lying around but it wasn't large enough to patch the rip. Now i have a lame little wading pool that no one will use and a ripped and deflating water slide I cannot return to the store. I've sent an email to the company, but I'm not getting my hopes up. My advice: buy a pool."
2,BAD PURCHASE,I bought this waterslide 2 weeks ago. We used it for less than 30 minutes and the slide sprang 2 leaks. I would NOT purchase this waterslide again. To much of a headache. A BAD PURCHASE!!!!! Good luck contacting the toy company to get any replacement parts. It is a act of congress to get anything done. And im not talking about amazon either. You have to contact the Banazi maker.
3,Banzai Cannonball Splash Water Slide,"I was very disappointed when this water slide arrived. The pictures and descriptions are VERY misleading. MUCH smaller than I expected. Doesn't appear to be very well made, but we have only had it 1 day, so can't really say if it will hold up or not. My 9 yr. old and 6 yr. old granddaughters also were expecting a much bigger slide, but as it turned out, they had a blast on it. The water slide is okay for the 6 yr. old, but the 9 yr. old is almost too big for it. If it will hold up a couple of months, through the summer vacation, it will be worth it."
1,Don't do it..I'm telling you!!!,I bought this hunk of junk last year and it broke the first day with 2 seven year olds playing on it. Aside from Banzai's deceptive pictures on the box...it was far smaller than pictured. I've noticed on all their products they photoshop in tiny kids to make their product look bigger!!! [...]If you love to waste money and see disappointment on your kids' faces then by all means...
3,Lots of fun,"Couldn't find this type of product anywhere here. However, note the slide is not very sturdy & my husband had to stabilize it & someone always had to be watching & holding onto it. Not for older kids."
2,Objects appear larger than actual size,"Originally purchased for children 6, 8, and 9 years of age and never used. Our 11 year old next door neighbor played several times and loved trying to see how far past the end of the pool she could slide. Not recommended activity. The yellow slide is too tall for most children to navigate. The pool is very shallow and not very long. A better use for the unit would be to disassemble and use the slide with a traditional swimming pool and allow the babies/toddlers to splash in the blue pool. Sorry I can not recommend."
4,Somewhat satisfied,"Pool was great, the kids realy enjoyed it. The sprinkler on the slide woked but the waterhose kept pulling and almost riped the connector. We had to diconnect the water hose and just use the pool. Was an ok purchase for the price but would not purchase another one."
1,doesn't work,"takes forever to fill up with air, then even though it was fully inflated the kids would compress it enough by sitting on it that they wouldn't really slide at all (the whole point). Also the picture on the outside of the box is a grotesque misrepresentation of its size."
2,Marginal,Not to good. It says for 5-12 yr old. I gave it to my 5yr old for his birthday. I don't think it will last too long. He really enjoys it anyway. I would buy the slip n slide with the pool at the end if I did it over again.
3,disappointed,"We are so bummed this toy does not hold up! It is made for one time use only! The first afternoon my 6 and 3 year olds played with this water slide and pool they had so much fun. I thought this was going to be a great summer fun activity in our backyard, but unfortunately after 2 hours of fun, the slide is no longer inflated. They played with it exactly as it was meant to be played with so it isn't like they rough housed so much it got destroyed. We are very disappointed because in those 2 hours we got a taste of the amount of fun we could have with it, but so sad it is so cheaply made and didn't hold up for more."
1,Disappointed!,We were so excited to finally get the slide! As soon as we opened it and began to inflate it we found a slow leak. It lasted outside less than 15 minutes. What a waste of money and a major disappointment.
1,What a rip off!!,"I bought two of these cannonball water slide with boogie board, slide/pools. I gave one to my grand duaghter who is only three. She knows how to swim. Anyway, from the onset, the pool seam had a hole, gaping. So I gave her the second one. Guess what? It would not hold water but could not find the leak. Talk about thin plastic. My freezer bags feel thicker. Luckily, Praise GOD!! I bought them online at Walmart. No problem in returning them to the store for a full refund!! Do not buy this item. Invest a little more and get the much thicker better Bonzai slide. Or just the great rectangle pool they had, also on the [...] 1website. Good Luck to all the others in returning your waste of money. Honestly $[...] + is too much for the materials used in this product."
1,RIP OFF!,"MUCH smaller than they make it appear. My kids were very disappointed, and by the time you have it all blown up, it's too late! Way too hard to repackage! Save your money...and heart break. By the way, mine's already popped!"
3,Does it's JOB!,I bought this pool for my daughter's 3rd birthday party for the older kids and it did the job! The only problem I had was the slide kept coming apart from the pool which the kids were falling away from the pool onto the lawn! My sister-in-law kids loved it so much she bought the same pool when she got home and she loves it!
3,not what my son thought,My son thought this would be something different from what it was. He liked it for a few minutes then that was that. It was not as big as he thought it would be.
1,water slide,This water slide is horrible. The slide doesn't stay connected to the pool. When my daughter goes down the slide it tipes over or she misses the pool completely by sliding off the side. You cannot go down without the buggie board or you get stuck at the bottom of the slide and never reach the pool. Horrible toy!
3,small but fun,"this is soooo much smaller than it appears. only good for kids around 4, 5,or 6 years old(unless they are small). It is alot of fun for the little ones though."
4,"Well, the kids love it","One way or the other, our girls (4 and 5) love the pool. But really think of it as a slipnslide with a deep end, and your're okay. It's not much of a pool. Very low. The attachment velcro should be more, but an adult manning the slide to keep it up and connected to the pool keeps the fun going. Some times we leave off the slide and they just slide in using the ramp."
2,It's not as big as it may appear,"I bought this thinking it would be nice and big. But it is smaller then it appears and it's not very stable. There is nothing that keeps the top part from detaching from the bottom pool. My son loved just trowing the raft, but kept getting wedge between the slide part and the landing part. Little disappointed for the amount of money it cost. I don't recommend it. Sorry."
4,Had a blast!,Used it 3 days in a row and holding up great! My kids 6 and 4 are having a blast..running snad sliding and landing in the pool. Our pool wasn't open yet ans it was a lifesaver this cazy hot week. Got it for $30 at Toys R us..worth every penny!
1,very Unsafe please don't use!!!!,I purchased this for my kids (6 & 4) to use in the backyard. The problem is that there is a big seperation between the pool and the slide part. My son was sliding down head first just like the picture shows when all of a sudden his head got stuck in the seperation and his body kept going over. I'm suprised that his neck didn't break. This also happened with my friends kids. This toy is so dangerous!!! Please consider buying something else!!!!
1,Horrible design,"This is the worst toy I have ever seen. The slide does not slide well and the pool is too small for the slide. My two 7 year old grandchildren called it a ""stupid toy."" Then they proceeded to try and make it work by redesigning it. They got really scratched by the pillow part in the pool. I don't think the manufacturer's tried this out. Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't buy it - Dangerous,"Don't buy this. It is unstable and dangerous. It doesn't stay upright and the kids slide off into the grass. When you connect the water hose to the slide, the slide is so unbalanced, that the weight of the hose pulls the slide a skew. Junk..."
1,Not very duraable,"This product is basically a one season toy at best. I do not deny that for the kids that is is a very fun toy when it is inflated. The problem is that it is not a very durable toy. The plastic is not very thick and the smallest abrasion is more than capable of inflicting a pin hole leak that makes the toy deflate and therefore unusable. The decision on whether to purchase the product needs to be based on if one is willing to spend the money knowing full well that this will be a one season product. If the expectation is that this product will last over a number of summers, then that expectation is unrealistic and should discourage the purchase of the product."
1,Worthless-The oracle documents are as good,I thought that this book would be better than the online oracle documentation. It isn't. In fact it is pretty much a regurgitation of the stuff in the mostly worthless Oracle Dataguard Concepts and Administration document. I needed much more info regarding how to set up the standby host including how to initially configure oracle (ie. should you create a DB when you install or not?) Even after buying this book I found myself Googling to get the info I needed.
1,not very useful,"I had high hopes when I purchased the book. After reading it over, I found it poorly organized, written and edited. The information was little more than what's available in the Oracle documents and in metalink, as has been pointed out. The cartoons sprinkled throughout were distracting, amateurish, unfunny, and, in the case of the one on page 210, offensive.I have several books in this series and really like a few of them. Oracle Privacy Security Auditing is especially good. I wish the same were true of this waste of good paper."
2,Oracle DataGuard,The book is full of incomplete SQL statements. I had hoped this book would have had a step by step how to for creating a standby database. I also wish they had gone into DGMGRL more.
1,Really Bad,"This book is really bad. It may be technically correct, but is completely useless for actually understanding the Oracle Data Guard system. I would like to know _why_ I am typing something, not just _what_ to type (on Bipul's machine, in his network, BTW) Also, by trying to be correct for versions 9 and 10, the book becomes incoherent quickly."
5,awesome album...,"I came across an mp3 of Instead Laugh one day and loved it.I got this album shortly after and loved it. Its got a mellow rock sound that is a lot different from other stuff I've listened to. The songwriting in this album is AWESOME, both lyrically and musically."
3,"Good: Yes, Better than TooL: Please tell me your joking","Im sorry but what are you people talking about?!?!?!? Yes this is a good band with some semi-tolerable songs, but please if these guys were half as good as TooL they wouldnt sound anything like them. TooL brought talent and an original sound to a genre of metal that was beginning to become redundant. That to me is one of the reasons TooL will always have a place in my cd case. This band has talent and it is a decent cd but please atleast listen to the TooL cd's before you go calling every TooL influenced band gods."
5,OneSideHEROS,"To put this plain and simple, OSZ definately has potential. Their debut CD ""Is This Room Getting Smaller?"" is an awesome cd. Unlike most nu-metal bands, OSZ concentrates on lyrics and originality. I could go on and tell you that it rocks but you'd have to here it first. Songs like, Instead Laugh, New World Order, Shed the Skin, are incredible. Worth the 10 bucks."
4,God this band,I had the chance to see them come through Boise ID with Adema in 2002. I did not know anything about them nor did a buddy of mine I took with me to the concert. By the end of the nite after seeing the way they performed especially Mr. Radford me and my buddy were hooked on them. It was not until like 6 months later that I was able to find the CD and when I did I bought it up quick and it did not leave my player for 3 months straight. This album helped to define the summer of my graduation year and all in all helped me through some really tough situations in my life. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone and also keep a look out for Jasan Radford and Levon Sultanians new side band Abloom because they kick.
3,It's good...I guess...,"It would get 3.5 stars....but let's just get this straight, these guys are good, but no where near the status of TOOL. Maynard is GOD! Simple as that. I think Onesidezero and ultraspank are the only one that come close to sounding like maynard, and even still they are so far away. Good cd as they said, a lot better than most of the ""NU-METAL"" I do classify this as nu-metal..."
3,a crack of hope for rock as we know it,"its no fear factory or soulfly, but it is much better than whats out there right now. These guys are what Tool would sound like if they had any intensity. I especially like New World Order, its got a dope original sound to it, and the maynard better be taking some nots cause this band knows how to go off. They have potential, give them a try you might hear about them in the future."
4,"Good, but sometimes boring.","I think this book is preety good. Every chapter ending and paragraph ending were cliffhangers. But some parts were BOR-ING. Overall, I give this book ****."
3,Scrooge,"A newer creepier verison of A Chrismas Carol. Kenny as Scrooge. And a biker,a ghost(the one on the cover), and something else as the three ghosts. Ending leaves you kinda hanging. But It's an okay book. If you like R.l.Stine, then read this book."
1,NEVER BUY PHILIPS!!!,"If you're thinking about buying a Philips, THINK AGAIN!! Their products are absolutely TERRIBLE, and their customer service and policies are even WORSE. I can relate to the other customers and their reviews. I am currently on my THIRD DVD-recorder because they just keep breaking down without warning. The last one I had broke after just SIX WEEKS. And God help you if you try to call their customer service center! All they tell you to do is spend YOUR money to ship back THEIR faulty products. They refuse to do anything the least bit helpful, claiming it's ""Not their policy"". Not their policy to satisfy their customers?! Apparently not, because I am FAR from satisfied.PLEASE reconsider buying anything by Philips! Or if you DO make that fatal mistake, do yourself a favor and return the product to the store, get your cash back, and buy something reliable like a Sony or Panasonic. Trust me---you'll be glad you did!!"
1,Why make DVD recorders when you can't make them right?,I made the fatal error to buy a philips recorder last year. it started screwing up after 7 (!) recordings so I took it back. It did the same after 20 recordings and I took it to be serviced for a second time. When I got it back it wouldn't even read the disc!!! I had to yell at them to get a replacement and I got the 3355 model today! It did exactly the same thing that user Brad Smith described and YES it is a really frustrating experience. Avoid Philips products or at least their DVD recorders!!!
1,Still going to hell in a hand basket,"I have been a Steve Allen fan since the late 50s. He was a comic genius, a so-so composer and a poor author. Most of this book is devoted to endless transcripts of the Madonna appearance on David Letterman, HBO's ""Sex and the City"", and rap lyrics. This is the kind of stuff that most people just naturally turn off and go on with their lives, but Mr. Allen seems to have taken a great deal of umbrage at them. It is easy to complain about how standards are being lowered. The hard part is figuring out what to do about it. Mr. Allen doesn't have much to suggest other than government censorship. He doesn't make a very strong case for censorship so the whole book comes off as a crotchety old man complaining about how bad things have gotten. You can get this kind of stuff for free from your grand parents so why pay $20 for it?"
1,grumpy old man,"With ""Vulgarians at the Gate,"" fifties TV fossil and self-proclaimed genius Steve Allen attempts to explain why he has not had a job for 30 years.It can't be a lack of talent, after all this a man who authored over 1000 songs,(name two), countless books, (name one besides this one), and hosted several failed TV shows, (remember the one where he sat around with actors dressed as Jesus, and Freud?)Allen blames the demise of his career and Western civilization on Howard Stern, Madonna, and David Letterman. Allen cannot stand the fact that these show-biz powerhouses whom Allen, of course, views as far less talented than he, are successful and he is not.Allen makes a case for the criminalization of off-color entertainment that is about as convincing as his toupee. For Lawrence Welk fans only."
3,Exactly what you would expect from the title.,"I respect Steve Allen and thought he had a lot of great ideas about how to combat the trash that is too easily being watched by our children, but felt like it was too simplistic. Furthermore, the answer to any responsible parent is to either get rid of the TV or limit/supervise it 100%.Allen did keep my interest, but mostly just to see what example he would complain about next. Recommend checking this one out from the library, at best."
1,Solo Barista,"Starbucks today recalled the 8 cup Barista due to electrical fires. I bought the Solo model, and had to return it due to an electrical fire. The replacement they gave me also smells of burning plastic, plus both units spill coffee onto the counter as the design specifications do not have the cup high enough to trigger the auto-drip to properly align with the cup. I've unplugged this second one and hope to return it tomorrow, as I am afraid of a fire."
5,Personal guide to avoiding conflict,"Smith's book is a great reminder that violence is everywhere and it can happen to anyone. It is a brilliant tool book to avoiding and dealing with conflict. It lays out ground rules of how to act and react to conflict. It also gives an idea of what type of people start conflicts and why they do. Personally I found the book to be very interesting because Smith uses real life scenarios that anyone can relate to. Surviving Aggressive People is a great book for anyone in the workplace, for parents, teachers, and anyone else who wants to be street savvy."
5,A lot of practical advice on an important issue,"This is a very well written and knowledgable book on dealing with aggressive (and potentially violent) people. It's basic information that we should all have learned in school, but did not. Learn the difference between the Desperate Aggressor and the Expert Aggressor. This kind of knowledge is more useful than the knowledge of martial arts - which in any realistic person's view must always be a last resort. Highly recommended!"
2,not for me,"I just don't think magic realism is for me. I didn't enjoy this book but that's not to say others won't. There are things you can get out of it about the overall feelings surrounding mass migration to the cities in Turkey and what that entails, but I'd rather read something a little more down to earth.2.5"
4,Solid,"Solid, quality handles. Four stars because comes only with short screws (too short for drawers)."
4,Mostly for Naguib Mahfouz fans,"I am not such a fan of Naguib Mahfouz's stories. I have read some of his books and I liked them, but I am not crazy about him. However, this book offers his fans a chance to look through pictures at the most usual places described in his novels and this makes the book interesting and worth looking at. But it is not a photo-guide book of pictures as I have imagined it was before buying it. On the whole, if you have read many novels of this writer and are familiar with the Cairo shown in them and want a glimpse at real buildings and streets, I recommend this book."
2,Not as easy as it looks...,"I didn't realize that it is difficult for the child playing with the toy to see the lights flash as he/she is playing..as they are laying down. You could let them play with it on thier stomach but the reaction they get from the toy when they hit it really isn't much. It is difficult for the child to see that their action made the toy perform. For the price, I think you can get a more entertaining toy for infants. My 2 year old loves to stand on it, and play it with her feet though. My infant doesn't seem to care if it is there or not."
1,I Regret Buying This Toy!,"The fabric cover prevents good contact with the keys underneath. Piano underneath the cover is undecorated, yellow with all white keys, so baby cannot anticipate which key makes which sound, and makes no visual connectin to auditory input. Ugh."
2,We were very disappointed in this toy! Our baby doesn't play,"with it at all! We had heard good things about it, so we bought one when she was 3 months old, and now at 9 months she still doesn't play with it. The best thing about it for us is that it can be set to play by itself, and she likes listening to that and watching the lights sometimes. Worth a try maybe, but I definitely do not consider this toy a ""must have"" based on my experience and having had talked to a few others about it."
1,"Looks fun, but it's not","My toddler daughter and I saw the commercial on TV. Then she asked me to get one for her. Since I have another infant baby, I ordered one... After we got it, none of them really likes it. The voice is too low. There is no excitement at all for my babies. It makes animals' sound too, but whenever my baby hears it, she starts to cry. Overall, I feel very disappointed of it. Maybe it is a good toy, but not for my daughters."
2,Toy Mom,"I bought this for my son a year ago when he was 7 months old. I was quite disappointed, the volume is so low you can hardly hear it. He's only played with it a handfull of times within the year. Thumbs down on this one."
4,Even a Baby can do this!,"I bought this item for my 3 month old's crib. It didn't work well because she couldn't see what she was kicking, and when placed on the side of the crib, she could see it but not kick it. Now that she's 5 months, and can control her arms and hands more effectively, she loves to play with it, in the crib and on the floor. The keys are easily activated, so she doesn't need to apply much pressure, and she doesn't need to be accurate either! She loves it!"
4,How is it really?,The commercial for this toy shows the baby kicking it in his crib.That never really worked for my daughter.You would have to scrunch your child all the way down to the end of the crib and then hope they kick hard enough to trigger the music.But as she got older she would wake up and play with it in her crib.I don't know a mom that couldn't use a little extra time before the kids get up.Also you can have them play with it on the floor and that works too.My daughter got hers for Christmas last year and is still playing it.
2,How to salvage this toy,"My daughter (14months) has had this toy for 7 months now and has never been much interested in this toy. From time to time, I used to distract her from a good cry by making the lights flash. One day, however, we were both a little bored, so I took the mechanism out of the cushy case. She was much more interested in pushing the big white keys. Most fun she's ever had with it!"
2,Schmeh,"My son is now 5 months old and has never shown any interest in this toy. Maybe part of the reason why is that it was hard for him to kick it hard enough or in the right spots to make it play enough? Either way, I took it out of his crib since he wasn't getting any use out of it. Maybe he'll like it to use on the floor when he's sitting up? We'll see."
3,Crib Music,"I am so glad that we have this piano. I have it in my son's crib. I has 3 settings, the 1st it plays music for about 10 minutes(nursery rhyme songs) while the lights blink. This is the one I have used most. We start it at bed time, it turns itself off, and my son learned that he can push any ""key"", and it will restart whenever he needs it at night. NO mommy required. The volume is a little loud, so I put several pieces of scotch tape over the speaker which he has never removed. My son doesn't much care for the other settings where he can play his ""own"" music, and he has never played it by kicking like the baby does on the TV commercial."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this toy for my 5 month old, and I was very disappointed in it. It's much too quiet, and there's no volume control. The sound is bad, and you have to hit the keys too hard for it to be fun. AND if you put it at the foot of the crib and the baby lays down to kick it, they can't see what they're doing to make the noise anyway. I'm sorry I bothered with it."
2,BABY NOT INTERESTED,"This toy looks and sounds great, but my baby (now 18 months) has never really taken to it. Other more simple toys, like a ball or the sparkling symphony stacker, have provided much more fun for baby. When baby was immobile it did provide some stimulation, but since he was up and about he would much rather explore and pick up little objects."
2,My Baby's First Piano,"I'm rather disappointed by the lack of interactivity of the Fisher-Price ""Kick and Play"" piano. Yes, it's durable -- in good Fisher-Price form. Yes, it's colorful and pretty. I have two major problems with this toy, though:1. You have to be rather precise to actually hit the key and make it work -- not easy for chubby five-month-old hands/fingers/feet (and by the way, he's NEVER tried to play it with his feet!); and2. It fails to really grab and keep my baby's attention as much as I thought it would. It just kind of lays there, and the only thing that catches Xander's attention are the loose tie-up strings dangling from it... (?!?)"
2,Not much fun and little used by my son,"The toy is well made, the sound passable, and the idea great. The problem is that my son, and the other infants that we have had visit, have not played with this toy much at all."
5,My infant loved this toy,"My baby boy as an infant really loved this toy. It will run in auto mode to help him fall asleep to the music that it plays and the flashing color lights. We had woken up many mornings and he was just sitting in his crib, quiet and content playing with the Piano. I would highly recomend this toy for any exspecting parent."
5,Long lasting toy!,Our daughter loved it...she enjoyed looking at it when she was very little and now it sits on the floor and she plays with the different settings. Good value!
5,Kick and Play piano a geat kick I mean hit!,I bought this item for my daughter that is 3 months. She was kinda skeptical with it at first but as soon as she kicked it the first time she was in love with it. The funny thing about it is that most babies that are sick wont do anything but fuss! Well she loved the lights and music and that it all changed as soon as she kicked it. She also likes it on her changing table so she can watch the lights while she gets changed and she can bat it with her hands too. I highly recommend this for babies who dont like to go to bed at night. It makes great bright lights to play themselves to sleep.
1,Mom just wanna have fun too!,"I have the kinda of baby who would play with anything, from her toes to the her excersaucer. But there is one exception- the Kick and Play Piano. The only visual stimulation are dim lights the size of quarters and very difficult to see. There are three different audio settings but none of them offer much challenge or entertainment for the child. I just think for the price you can get something much more interesting and FUN."
2,Not Impressed,Got this for my baby when he was born. He's 9 months and still hasn't shown any interest in it. Have to apply a lot of pressure on the keys to get a sound out of them. He couldn't do it as an infant.
3,I like this one...,"I too got this toy when my daughter was just an infant and attached it to her crib. She never did figure out how to kick it to make it work (and she's 13 months old now) but when I play it for her, she likes to hear the sounds and see the lights. Also if she moves against it on accident, I guess it's pretty sensitive because it goes off easily, and she likes that. Not to mention it has bright colors which would be visually stimulating even for an infant who can't make it work. These days she sits up in her crib and uses her hands to make it work and it still keeps her attention occupied for a while. Somebody said that they found it way too loud...I have not noticed that, I think the sound level is fine."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this toy for my son after seeing the commercial on TV. It's really not at all what I expected. It is very hard for little hands to to push the keys. When it's hooked up in my son's crib and he kicks it, he gets very bored because lying flat on his back he can't see the lights, which are nothing special. I still have it hanging in his crib, but more for the music than anything else. I was very disappointed in this item."
4,HIS AUNT BOUGHT IT,My sister Jenny bought this toy for my son. It is in his crib with all the other crib toys he has. I turn it on for him and he kicks it. He seems to like it. I am glad it is washable. I just wish that some of the infant toys would play other songs. My son is 3 months and I'm already tired of hearing the same tunes over and over.
5,Very good crib toy!,"We got this for our daughter at Christmas when she was 3 months old. She loved it then, and she still does. At first, just the sounds and lights captured her attention but now, at 5 months, she can do it herself either with her feet or her hands. The thing I love about it most, are the different settings. You can set it just to play music all of the time, or on one of the settings that plays some at first, and then is quiet so that the child can do it themselves. They soon discover that they can, and it holds their attention for a good period of time. It plays a good variety of songs."
1,I should have read the reviews,"I thought this toy was going to be a hit. The color, concept and lights all lead me to believe that I was taking home a hit. Well it is very misleading. Baby can't see lights while kicking it, it rest too low and is pretty hard on babies feet. No toddler in their right mind will enjoy this silly piano with 4 keys and mind you they don't even sound good. I love Fisher Price but they bombed out on this toy. My baby prefers the over the head toy he can see and bat.He really enjoys the sparkling syphony which is a life saver."
2,"OK, I guess",A little pricey for a babies toy. Offers about 15 minutes of attention each play time...get the picture parents.
5,My 6 month old daughter is loving this toy,"This is the best $30 I've spent on a toy so far. It has lights, sounds, and a variety of settings so it's not the same sound over and over again. You pick the setting. Now that she has just started crawling, she likes to crawl on the keyboard which produces different sounds and amuses her. I think that she will grow into this toy and enjoy the variety (i.e., animal sounds versus songs) when she is older and can appreciate them. One little warning, when I purchased this toy I did not realize it has a soft keyboard (i.e., it has a soft fabric cover over the entire toy). This is great for little hands, and is good for machine washing, but is not ideal for wiping up frequent spit ups which come up easier on hard plastic."
1,A joke for a toy,"We bought this toy last christmas for my then 5 month old son. He absolutely hated it. The fabric would not stay over the keys where you could play the thing. Also it was very loud. A word of advice, please save your money and buy something else. Trust me!!"
3,It's OK at best...,"We had to wait until after Christmas to get this because all of the stores were out of it. I should have kept on waiting. Yeah, it's ok, but it's not at the top of my 8-month old son's toy list. He really enjoys the light show and the automatic playing sounds, but he gets bored with that and moves on. The sounds in themselves aren't very loud, and since most of his time is spent on the floor, it's just that much more muffled. The animal sounds are hokey, don't bother. My son loves to kick, but this just didn't do it for him. All in all, an OK toy, but not a list topper..."
2,Not as fun as I thought it would be !!!,"I bought this for my youngest girl when she was 4 months old and she just wasn't that interested. I was extremely disappointed and really encouraged her, even now at 15 months she is still not interested. She didn't spend much time in the crib and that may have had something to do with it. I don't recommend this toy to anyone. There are better things to spend your money on --like building blocks!!!"
1,Uninspired,"It looks as if my 9-month daughter won't be taking up piano by her bored-out-of-my-mind attitude towards this toy. The area in which to press for sounds is much smaller than the ""key"" itself and is difficult for little fingers to find. She also shows absolutely no interest in simply lying and kicking it. The only fun we have ever had is by my ""walking"" her over the keys. It sits on the bottom of the toy box these days collecting dust."
1,I do not recommend this toy,I do not recommend this toy. The music and sound of this toy is so low that it never interest my son. I thought I bought a broken toy when I tried it the first time when I couldn't really hear the music. I'm just cheated by the appearance of the toy. But my son is not even interested in the appearance of the toy.
1,disappointmen,This toy is a big disappointment. Only a small area of each key is sensitive to touch so if the baby touches any portion of the key other than the center of the animal printed on the key it does not work. I would not recommend this toy to anyone.
3,"not a must have, but cute","My daughter sort of likes this, but it's not her favorite. The animal sounds scare the daylights out of her, and she can't seem to get the hang of kicking it, so I just leave it on continous play. Maybe she would like it better as a lap toy or in the floor or something."
2,"""not fascinated in louisiana""","My little boy has had this toy since his birth - I tried it in his playpen, his crib, on the couch, on the floor, everywhere! He didn't like it from the get go. Now he's 14 months old, and he still doesn't like to play with it."
2,Needs some redesign!,"We received this as a gift when our son was born. He is now 3 months old and unfortunately, he has not been able to really use it. If your crib has solid panels at the head and foot, the ties are not long enough to reach to the first slat on the side. I can't tie it to anything, so I won't leave it in for him to play with, as I am afraid it will fall on him. I have held it there for him to play with, and he loves to kick at it and watch the lights. So if your crib has slats at the head and foot, then go for it. But if you have solid panels, don't waste your money!"
5,A big hit with the nieces,"I got this for my one-year old niece, but the two year old loves it as well. It hooks easily to the side of the crib, and is both washable and durable."
4,Waste of money,"This was one toy that we definitely wasted our money on. Our baby was so unimpressed with it. Visually, it is not very stimulating at all, and though our little one ADORES music, she did not seem too excited about the tunes she was kicking out either. This toy just seemed to lack any spunk whatsoever. There are definitely more exciting and stimulating toys on the market that you can spend your money on, that's for sure. In fact, if you're ever in New York, you can drop by and pick up ours for free! We'd love to have someone take it off our hands. Hee HeeGood luck!"
1,I wish I read the reviews before I purchased it for my son,I should have read the reviews. With all the mixed feelings about this toy I probably would not have purchased it if I had read them. A little to late...........
4,Bright,"My 4 months old got very excited about new toy in his crib. Now that he is almost a year, he still occasionally plays around with it. I believe it has a long lasting value. I am sure he will enjoy it even more when he is old enough to understand that different sound sare made by different animals."
2,Not what I had expected,"We bought this for our baby when he was about 5 months old. He is now 14 months old and has never kicked the piano in his crib, nor paid much attention to it otherwise. He likes to touch the lights and tries to get into it and see what's behind it, and that rather takes away from the buttons he's supposed to push to make the sounds. This toy was too expensive for my son to be so disinterested. Maybe he'll grow into it, but so far, he hasn't."
2,Not as fun as commercial makes it look!,"My son was given this as a gift when he was 4 months old -- we hung it up and thought he'd play with it and have fun since he loved the Sparkling Symphony but he never thought it was fun. We even reintroduced it at a year and he was bored by it -- Sparkling Symphony is a much better toy this is a boring, not well designed toy. Don't waste your money --"
5,"This toy was a gift for my infant, but my toddler loves it!","The Kick N' Play Piano was a gift for my 6-week old son for Christmas. I put it in his crib and turned it on when he would spend awake time there. When my toddler son hears the animal sounds and familiar nursery rhymes, he asks to play with the baby. Now that the baby is sitting up, they play in the crib together and my toddler is ""teaching"" his baby brother the different animal sounds. He'll say, ""dog, cat, cow..."" and the baby laughs at him. Which only encourages him to do more. I feel that both of my sons are learning more than just animal sounds, names and songs, they are also learning to play together and enjoy each other. This is such an important lesson and one they will both value as they get older. We have a house full of toys, but the Kick N' Play Piano can be enjoyed by both of my sons together and for that, I would have to say it's my favorite!"
2,Looks Like Fun but Doesn't Keep Baby Interested,"I thought this toy would be stimulating for my child but she rarely plays with it. We bought in when she was 2 months old. She liked the lights and music and would fall asleep to it sometimes. It doesn't have a timer and it will turn back on if the baby rolls over while sleeping and bumps it. When it turned on while she was asleep it would wake her up. Also, I have never seen her kick it to activate it and she is one year old now."
4,"Nice toy, but, needs some adjustments",This is a nice toy because babies love to kick their feet. The only thin wrong with it is it needs to have a volume control. It can be a bit loud for the newborn use where it is placed on the side fo the crib.
1,My baby has never used this toy.,"I have a baby that absolutely loves to kick, so I thought this toy sounded great. She has not used it once. She won't kick against it and doesn't know that the kicking causes a sound. I realize that maybe she'll like it when she's older, but for now, this toy is just collecting dust for us. We sometimes turn it on in her crib for her to listen to music, but it doesn't have a timer, so it's not good for putting her to sleep. It also doesn't have volume control."
3,Cute but not entirely pleased with this toy,"On the plus side: This toy has three different modes - musical tunes, animal noises and a musical scale. That makes it versatile.On the down side: First of all, it is a confusing interface, because you have to press on the soft keys and not the big shiny light up buttons to play with it. Also, the hard plastic parts make it a bad toy to actually tie to the inside of a crib because your little one could roll into it and hurt her head.The internal parts, which are hard plastic, separate easily from the soft cover, and sometimes causes the toy to malfunction. For those reasons, I don't recommend this product.The Sparkling Symphony Gym is a much better piano toy."
3,Kick and Play,"When I saw this product on TV, I thought it would be a wonderful toy that my daughter would enjoy. The lights on the toy caught her attention for about two months and after that, it was totally useless. It is also one of the loudest toys that I have ever encountered. Especially in the middle of the night when my daughter decided she wanted to kick and play with it."
2,disappointed,"I expected more from this toy. The sound level, is too low. It should have been made with an adjustable sound level. The keys on the piano should be more sensitive (on the entire key) not just a paricular spot.I will be returning mine to the store today, I only bought it yesterday at a very high cost at that..."
2,Too hard to use!!,"I got this toy for christmas for my daughtor, she was four months old at the time. The toy proved too hard for her to use because you have to push the keys so hard. My daughtor is now ten months old and still has trouble getting the toy to respond!!! I will say however that at night when she does get the toy to work she Quiets down and the lights and music put her to sleep."
4,good growing toy,"This toy was purchased for my then 2 mo. old son at that age he liked to hear the music when I pushed the keys then at 4 mo. he could ""kick"" them himself..He loved that.Now this toy is 18 mo. old & my son is 20 mo. It still gets played with. I like how it has different settings for single notes, songs & animal sounds. It also has an ""off"" switch."
1,Disappointing,"Now 10 months old, my child has had this toy since 5 months of age. When attached to the crib, my child did not show any interest in kicking and playing with piano. Worse, when attempting to play with toy in a sitting position, my child kept trying to press the flashing lights to make the sounds occur. He did not associate the keys with the sounds and ultimately became bored with the toy. A better design would have directly incorporated the flashing lights into the key pads."
4,Kick & Play Musical Piano,"I love this toy when my daughter is awake. She likes to see the lights and hear the music. However, when she sleeps, she always wakes me up by kicking it. My solution was to turn it off at night and just let her play during the day. Although she doesn't spend much awake time in her crib, she does play with it while I put her laundry away, or clean her room. For this purpose alone, I think it is worth it."
5,"Buy it, don't even think about it, just buy it !...","Great video for any velvet underground fan. The group is incredible, especially John Cale. This was the first time I had ever seen the group or any of the group's members play and I would have paid anything to see them. This video is not perfect (Lou's the star of the video and I missed more of Sterling and Maureen) but for those of us who haven't had the chance to see any of them on stage, its well worth the price. I specially loved Hey Mr. Rain and Heroin, but all the songs are very cool, I mean, come on! It's the Velvet Underground on video!"
2,WHAT A WASTE,"This has absolutely the worst picture quality I have ever seen on a DVD. There is no excuse. Moreover, there are absolutely no extras. Finally, this concert was shot as if it was a Lou Reed solo show, not a Velvet Underground show (e.g., when Sterling Morrison takes a solo the camera focuses not on Sterling but on Lou WATCHING Sterling soloing). Moe Tucker might as well not even be there for the amount of camera time she gets."
4,Wish it had more songs...,"No much to say about this. I'm a Velvet Underground fan and it was about time I bought this DVD. Image and sound quality is good, not outstanding. Some edits are a bit weird, but it satisfies overall. Only major complaint is that it should really be a 2-DVD set, because there are some many other great V.U. songs that could have made into this video."
3,All Tomorrow's Partes?,"I purchased this item after having purchased the CD, and was dismayed to find that John Cale's performance of All Tomorrow's Parties was absent! WHY? Well Nico is long gone to Yesterday's Parties, but it is still my all-time favorite from the original group. All other reviews make salient points, and this DVD is well worth it.The Velvet Underground - Velvet Redux: Live MCMXCIII"
4,Could have a had some extras,"I thought this one might be as dull as Lou Reed's earlier DVD release Spanish Fly, but thankfully I was wrong. This show highlights the band much later in life, but still putting on one hell of a show. Naturally they cover all of the crowd favorites, and the sound is excellent. Everyone in the group is at the top of their game and show no signs of rust. Could have a had some extras."
3,For the faithful only,This DVD is four middle-aged rockers who had gone straight - at least on the surface - and played the old hits with an emotional detachment.It is certainly worth renting but don't buy unless you are a real VU fanatic.
4,Portrait in Time,"Of course we all know the story behind the leather and studs now, but the simple facts is that is was cool back then. I showed this at our weekly poker game and the non-Priest fans got a kick out of laughing at the costumes but the Priest fans (me included) enjoyed the show. Just a solid rock show from beginning to end with a great singer and a solid band playing songs that most people will have some familiarity with and all the Priest fans will deem as classics."
4,Exellent way to reminisce,"I saw this tour 24 years ago and it brought me right back. My only complaint is with the audio. If you're into guitars you probably favor Tipton over Downing. The audio on this DVD is mixed such that KK's guitar is almost always overpowering Glenn's. That's quite a big loss. I have a bootleg of this concert on VHS and the audio is fine. Not sure what happened here. It's still a great show and if you were there when it happened or just love Priest circa 1982 it's worth it, just know what you're getting."
1,DVD video NOT DVD quality,Terrible video quality. Looks as though a 1982 VHS that had been overplayed was then burned to DVD. A rather noticeable horizontal tracking line is present throughout the show...very distracting AND definitely not to be expected for a DVD.
3,Won't get Grandpa's heart rate up,"Somewhat boring. The audience generally seems asleep (perhaps due to sound remixing). The camerawork/editing is definitely lackluster. For a good comparison, watch the 1982 and the 2004 Youtube clips of Breaking The Law. The 1982 version may sound better, but the 2004 version is far more energetic. And their hair (or lack thereof) looks far better."
5,Priest always pleases,"I was at this tour, and I will tell you Priest Rocks, I have been to every concert since screaming for vengeance, and I have back stage passes for nostradomus, The best band(Iron Maiden,AC/DC also)You will relive the past in your life, if you seen them in concert. THUMBS UPRoger K"
2,Problematic Release?,"Has anyone else noticed the problem with Glenn Tipton's guitar parts in the sound mix? On my DVD, either he's practically non existent (Electric Eye, Sinner, etc.) or barely audible (Bloodstone). I don't have a complicated set up, so this just shouldn't be....."
2,"The music is good, the vocals are not","After buying The Rising In The East dvd I just thought that Halford had lost it. His vocals and constant staring into a teleprompter are terrible. After watching Live Vengeance I now realize that Halford is just a terrible singer live. His vocals are unlistenable here. He's way out of key and hits so many wrong notes it's embarrassing. Oh well, I'll just stick to the studio albums where I guess they can fix the vocals."
3,In Their Prime,"This is an official taping of a Judas Priest concert in Memphis on the Screaming for Vengeance tour. They did a pretty good mix in the set list of what they had done up to that point. Judas Priest is a less offensive term for ""Jesus Christ."" The leather, whips and chains are all their. For Priest fans you can't go wrong."
4,Haddock sings Carson,"I love Jenny Lou Carson's music. She once was the last word in country music songwriters. But things went wrong between Jenny and the country music establishment, and so she fled to California to become a recluse.Her years with Fred Rose did much for her writing style and she pumped out one hit after another, including ""Jealous Heart"" and ""Let Me Go Lover.""One problem with this CD is Haddock's voice. He is all wrong for singing Jenny Lou Carson's music. One needs a soft-voiced female singer to put Carson's words into song. Haddock is earnest and his musicianship is good, but it's just the wrong voice.Carter SwartCrescent City, CA"
5,The Real Deal,"A ton of sound for two people. A trip back in time from 2004 to the early years of blues. Great harp. Fine slide guitar. Scorching vocals. Real emotion. This is the Real Deal. It's also an answer to the old time male blues singers, it's femanist blues. Bessie Smith and Big Mama Thornton would be proud."
1,Don't believe in this crook.,"At first who was Jim Bakker?A faker, a hipocrital, a liar, a bigot, a womanizer.And then this same crook comes, claiming that he is the God's prophet!In the last about 2,000 years ; many people have claimed that Jesus is near, and he will return in a few years/months.All of then were wrong.Jesus isn't returning.I tried to read this book about 10 years ago, here in Brazil.A pentecostal brazilian send this book to I read.After about one week reading this bad book, I return the book, to the owner.I never finished it.If after reading everything, I wrote up, if you want to buy this book, then a last question for me.Jim Bakker wrote this book claiming Jesus is near.Since this, more than 20 years have passed.Since than, China is more than 3 times more rich.Never in human history, so many people had car, clean water, eletricity,CD, DVD, computers,etc.And there's people believing in a crook called Jim Bakker."
3,Nice Couple,I have met these two a few times and I'll bet their two kids (One son and one daughter) are the luckiest kids to have parents that can entertain for them and to their loyal fans.
4,A sequel that exceeds expectations,"Sam Yarney has provided the first and second installments in a new series. One can only presume that he is leading up to the apocalypse, with dark characters, world domination, and prayer falling by the wayside. In 90 days, Yarney's main character, Cyrus Anderson, starts out as a profound non-believer. He and St. Thomas are of the same ilk. A no-nonsense international journalist, Cyrus takes in a stranger who will change not only the direction of his life, but might just take out the entire western world!In Air Rage, we meet Cyrus and some of his cohorts again. Things have been quiet, but not for long. Cyrus has become a believer and is convicted about the power of prayer. But his rational side still rears its ugly head, making things more difficult.Both books are fast reads, with adventure, surprise, and a positive message. If you have ever wondered why the end days have not drawn near, read how prayer and faith keep things moving forward."
1,Laser-Cut Plastic Stencils,"I looked at several of the stencils available, but bought none of them, because none of them contained a size. I need alphabet stencils 2 1/2 and 3 inches."
4,Just bought 505U,"I just bought this camera's successor, the JVC GR-DVL505U. It arrived yesterday, and it seems like a great product! I really only tried taking some basic shots and importing them into the PC, but I have high hopes for some great online home video in the future!P.S. I found the camera online for($) -- With accessories it came out to about the same price most major stores list it as."
1,Sun baked my watch face solid black,"In addition to the cost of having a jeweler fix my band, the sun baked the face of my watch turning the display solid black. These watches are cheap for a reason. They are designed poorly and made with junk. So, now what choice do I have but to throw away a watch not even worth chasing down the warranty for. What a disspointment!"
2,Watch out before you buy this watch,I purchased this watch only to discover that the watch band was way too big for me. You are supposed to be able to make it smaller by removing pins in the band by use of a paper clip. It does not work. You then have to take it to a jeweler (which is what LaCrosse recommends) to have the band shortened. So what you save on the watch you will end up paying the jeweler. Find a watch with a leather strap or an regular expansion band.
4,correct time,This is my second LaCrosse watch. The case and band simply wore out on the previous one after several years. The watch receives a radio signal from the National Institute of Standards and Technology station WWVB and continuously displays the correct time and date. An excellent and useful product.
5,Sleek watch,"The La Crosse WT-961S may be the nicest looking of radio-controlled watches. Also, being just 7/16 inch thick, it is sleeker than most. For me, the only lacking feature is a lighted display, but that means the battery should last longer, at least two years, maybe three. The WT-961S also lacks stopwatch features, which are of little use to me. All settings, adjustments, and the stimulus to search for a WWWB radio time signal are made through a single recessed button."
3,Bad band design,"I live in central California (farming area) and this watch was able to sync up and keep accurate time easily. Screen is easy to read in light. It has no back lighting so if you are in the dark, you will not be able to see the screen. Battery life is good. Watch band is custom designed for the watch, so if you break the band, you eight use it as a pocket watch or throw it away. Watch band is an important comfort feature and part of personal style. Having a non standard watch band was a bad idea. I like the time piece, but not the band."
5,Watch,I received this watch easy to setup. Works great. Looks good and fit good also. You would love to have one.
5,A Versatile Classic,"My son loved his snap-lock beads from infancy until about 2 years. Even now at 3 and a half he will pick up the beads and play with them occasionally. Don't overlook the simple classics when buying toys for a little one! Three beads are just as enthralling as 30, and they fit easily in a diaper bag or car seat pouch. Best of all -- no batteries or annoying sounds that accompany them!"
4,Lots of fun!,"Keeps my daughter busy for a long time - can easily be taken anywhere. Durable, can be thrown in the dish washer."
3,not what I expected,"the snap blocks that I ordered were a lot larger than the ones I have now. I wanted them to add to the set I have. There was no description of size, etc. Also, there were only 12 blocks. THAT wasn't listed either. I wouldn't have ordered these if I had know these two facts."
2,Not even funny,"Another in the deluge of hip retro acts exploiting younger listeners, HS does little more than offer undercooked indie-oldies that rarely do more than provide tacky texture and minimal melody."
4,Music again gets Magic,"I heard this album in a coffeehouse and had to ask what it was. It completely enthralled me from start to finish.There are very good songs here, each of them set in a beguiling landscape of noise controlled like I've never heard before...What impresses me most is that the musicians seem to inhabit the unused spaces of effects processors (the very parts which most musicians who use them try to avoid). The sound of these songs is as important as the melodic material they project (many bands try to do this, but ""HAHA Sound"" is the most successful balancing of the two I've ever heard). And Broadcast seem to enjoy playing in 6/8 time, a lost current of pop music. One of 2003's best."
4,wow,"I've been following Broadcast for a while now, since their first single really. While I thought that single had tons of potential (and was on Duophonic (I was a massive Stereolab obsessive in those days)) I thought that their first album failed to live up to that potential. On a whim I purchased the Pendulum single and was blown away by the A side. When Haha Sound came out I picked it up and I am now a total convert. This album combines elements of Stereolab, Portishead and Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd in to one spectacular piece of Acid/psych rock. Haha Sound manages to combine the worlds of Jefferson Airplane, The Strawberry Alarm Clock with the modern creepiness of bands like Portishead and Trickey while maintaining the ethereal Space-age bachelor pad feel and melodic influence of Stereolab. This is Broadcast's breakthrough album and one that should sit in your collection proudly on your CD shelf."
5,Unlike Anything Else,"Broadcast. Oh Broadcast. Could you GET any more wonderful? I don't think so. Upon listening to this album for a second time, I decided that I wanted to do nothing more for the rest of the day than buy all of Broadcast's albums and listen to them alone in a dark room. Utter bliss."
1,JUST AWFUL,"I COLLECT BIZARRE AND ECLECTIC MUSIC. THE ONLY CATEGORY THIS MIGHT FIT IN IS ""BIZARRE"". MY IMPRESSION IS, THIS CD WAS CREATED BY AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PIANO TEACHER AND A WANNA-BE OPERA SINGER. IT IS AWFUL. I THREW THE CD DIRECTLY INTO THE TRASH, AND DIDN'T EVEN SAVE THE PLASTIC CASE IT CAME IN."
2,Too Complicated,"I have been in this hobby for about 6 years and I still have not found this book helpful for any of my needs. It is too much complicated and not helpful for an aquaristic interest.Especially If you are a beginner, you will not find it helpful. The book is especially written for people who has scientific interest on Cichlid fishes; in detail with very few pictures."
4,love the sandat hat the strap,"This sandal is very comfortable and cute at the same time, the only thing i hate, that the strap is very thin and not easy to fasten, and most of the time i have to have my husband help me in the morning to put them on."
2,Uneven,"Nice looking pair of glasses but unfortunately we must have gotten a defective pair. One side of the glasses ( where it wraps and hooks around your ear). This was significantly higher than the other. You can notice this by setting the shades on the table - it did not lay flat. This caused the shades to sit uneven on your face. One side touched my cheek but the other side did not. One of the joints where the frame bends was screwed on way too tight, it made it hard to fold the glasses. Had high hopes for these pair too."
2,Pretty Bad: For Jolie Fans Only - And Then That's Pushing It,"I'm an Angelina Jolie fan - have been for years, however...this movie is pretty bad. And not a good kind of bad, but plain old bad. Bad story, bad writing, bad acting, bad lighting, bad looping, bad editing. Get the idea? What it comes down to is - The story stumbles around all over itself and unfortunately, Angelina isn't that good in it. She pouts a lot and tries real hard to project angst, but that's not worth the cost of a purchase. Your local video store probably has a couple of copies of this in stock - I suggest you rent it before you consider buying it - even for the die hard Jolie fan. If you're a completist - and just need to own/have everything Angelina Jolie has been in - okay, then it's a must have, otherwise - pass on it.Best Regards, turtlex"
2,IT'S ONLY ME BUT:,EVEN FOR A DIE HARD JOLIE FAN LIKE ME THIS MOVIE WAS BAD. ANGELINE SMILES IN IT LIKE 2 OR 3 TIMES. THE ACTING IS POOR AND THE MOVIE ITSELF IS JUST BAD. JM
5,Harry Stack Sullivan discovered,It was a fascinating and understandable read. I especially enjoyed the chapter on his personal history. It was a wonderful case formulation and gave greater depth and understanding towards learning about his theory and how it came about. I had no idea he was so influential and yet so overlooked. The author did an excellent job explaining possible reasons for this. I would recommend this book as required reading for counseling and psych students.
2,"Poor quality, but worth what I paid","This was purchased at under $10 combined with a 4 for 3 promotion. Thank goodness, as there were a few enamel flaws, and the overall quality was lacking. Nice for someone starting out, not for a java junkie who displays her coffee collection in every corner of the house."
2,Brass Squeeze Valve,"Disappointed, I ordered a new valve and was sent a used valve. Though is appeared to be priced less than a new valve and functions it is not what I ordered. Additionally Sears sells not only a valve but also the propane torch and handle as a kit for considerable less than the recommended ""package"" on Amazon. Returning the package to Amazon would have incurred restocking charges that made it about an equal deal. Recommendation check Sears first."
5,Must Have Addition to Dragon Torch,Let me say nice addition to dragon Torch they should just come with it thought. No Issues in years of use. Make sure you Pipe dope nd tight completely as you are dealing with presurized gas.
1,Never Received,"My review is the same as James Likely's, I never received it so I can't review it. I'm still trying to get reimbursed for this phantom product."
1,did not receive,"sorry, as much as i would like to review this product i am unable to since i've not received it and have not received a refund as of yet. i am not a real happy camper right now."
1,Allure: The weakest of all R&B Female Groups,"As a follow up to mildly successful debut on Crave/Sony Records, the four girls of Allure recently released Sunny Days on MCA Records. After almost 3 years of waiting, I've got to admit that I was expecting to see a vast improvement of song writing quality and vocal arrangements. Unfortunately, Sunny Days fall short on both categories.In general, the album stagnates in many midtempo songs that all seems to sound like the other. The group bragged about their involvement in the production and the writing and this was perhaps not the best idea. In comparison to recent efforts from Destiny's Child or Blaque or any of the other Female R&B; groups, Sunny Days comes across as not quite as hip and not quite as fun and definitely not sexy.(...)"
3,Alright,I didn't realize the pages would be in black and white like they were copied. And I don't see why the book was still just as much even though it was the economy edition.
1,Can't review it.,"I would love to review this book, but I can't because the seller took my money and never shipped the book. I have filed a claim with Amazon, and I'm waiting further notice."
4,Ok Quality,I bought this product for school. It was a great value and it fit the necessary requirements I needed it. Good value.
4,Beats the school store,"Had to get this book for class and the price was much better than the school store. Using standard shipping, the book arrived prior to the start of the semester. I'm glad I chose to order my books this way."
1,Where is Vygotsky?,"""Lev Vygotsky: Revolutionary Scientist"" by Fred Newman and Lois Holzman purports to be a clear introduction to Vygotsky and his ideas but it's actually a muddled, mish-mosh in which Vygotsky's discoveries get lost in a sea of philosophical, political, and psychological jargon. For example, the authors devote pages to discussing the ""Zone of Proximal Development,"" a concept central to understanding Vygotsky's contributions to learning theory, but never bother to explain or define it for the reader. Moreover, the authors have an alarming axe to grind. Fired up by revolutionary zeal, they want to show that Vygotsky's ideas are thoroughly Marxian and are valueless in any other context. Reading the book has something of the feeling of being invited to a seminar on financial planning and then discovering that the seminar is a poorly disguised infomercial for an expensive and unremunerative annuity. Readers searching for a lucid introduction to Vygotsky should look elsewhere."
2,Harper Collins Robert French Unabridged Dictionary,"Not a French Unabridge Dictionary, this is, in fact, a very good French-English English-French dictionary. While it is quite good, you should realize the title is misleading and it is written and compiled in England. You will find unfortunate translations which skew the real meaning. Example: 'tetes brulees' is translated as ""desperado"", when it really means 'hot-head', 'daredevil'. Another: ""foutu"" is translated as 'damn', 'bloody', when it really means the four-letter word ""f---""."
4,Very complete except for Verbs,"While this book has great definitions, a nice font so everything is easy to read, the section on verb forms is a little lacking. Since irregular verbs are probably the hardest part of this language, I didn't feel it was a good idea to put all the irregular verb tenses in a very simplified table form with just the verb endings. You really need to see the entire verb spelled out properly. This may not bother everyone, but it did me."
1,Not for the MJ fan,This book is written by a relative of the accusers of Michael Jackson's child molestation charges. It's a hard read and I had a tough time getting through it. Don't believe everything you read!! Justice for Michael!
4,good intro to Kaz,"I am a middle school librarian AND a soon-to-be adoptive mother of a Kaz baby. I happened to have this book in my middle school library and found it good basic info on Kaz. It covers history, people, food, traditions; all the basics. It's fairly up-to-date too which is nice. The author must be Kaz as he (she?) talks about Kaz in glowing terms that don't always seem warrented (I remember something like --Kazakhstan has some of the most beautiful landscape in the world-- which clearly contradicts other information about the steppes.) That said, a good intro to Kaz, especially for the younger reader."
4,A Highly Effective Guide to BC Testing,"This book is a well-researched, well-written guide to the all-important process of disaster recovery plan testing. It's an area many people omit from their plan development process because it takes time to plan and execute a good exercise. Mr. Rothstein's book greatly simplifies the process, taking the fear out of testing. Recommended for all serious business continuity professionals!"
4,A book you can count for,"If you do not know how to plan for a DR, and you want to have your documentation in place. This is a book you can count on. It might even help you for your certification if you plan for SUN DR.You should also read another of his book ""a guide to bcp"". that will help to complete a whole picture."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed - the plot never got together, I found it boring, I never got into the characters.and their was no build to the climax. I have loved all her other books though."
4,Revisit with 2 of All-time favorite characters,"Okay, so it wasn't as good as High Energy, not nearly as good, actually, but of course I still wanted to read about some of my very favorite characters. Only thing was that I thought when I kept seeing this book advertised was that it must surely be the long-awaited story about the secondary characters, Mills and Gregor. Sure I want to read about Tyber and Zanita again, but I'll do that by picking up High Energy again... and again. THAT one was delectable, and I wouldn't change a thing. This one, well, yeah, I would change one thing: Make it a story about Mills and Gregor and have us revisit Tyber and Zanita as secondary characters! Okay, okay, not possible at this point, but next time, right? It was still a light and enjoyable read, however. I just probably won't read it again, as I have with the first one."
2,Don't bother,This story was no where near as good as the first story High Energy. The story had absolutely no energy and it seemed as though she had to force herslef to make the book. And the romance between Mills and Gregor never really gets a resolution. Hopefuly she'll make a book for them.
1,"""Lame""","I'm surprised anyone had anything good to say about this book. I'm generally not that critical, a book doesn't have to have a perfect plot, or the perfect character development, etc, but it does have to entertain me, make me laugh and touch me to some extent. This just didn't do any of that for me. After reading the 1st chapter, I was already sick of the cute names and smirks thrown over the shoulder, etc. But being that she is one of my favorite authors AND the fact that I have to finish a book no matter what, I finished the book. There was no redemption anywhere in the book. It never got better. I'm surprised that the publisher/editor/whoever is in charge would let a book that bad out."
3,One-dimensional,"Ever since hearing that Dara Joy was releasing a sequel to the fabulous story of Zanita and Tyber (High Energy), I have anxiously checked websites for a release date. I practically ran to the bookstore to get this book and left a bridal shower early in order to go home and read it. It is good...but, I had hoped for more emotional development from both characters. Tyber is sexy, intelligent, and obviously dervoted to Zantia. But, that's it! He wants Zanita. But, does he really need her? We never really get inside his head. We never see him take seriously the concerns that Zanita has over committing to a relationship.He simply decides that she has cold feet and he will convince her (in a sneaky, somewhat manipulative way) that they belong together.Tyber and Zanita are great characters, but they both need more depth and more emotion."
2,"OK, he's a modern day pirate. We get it.","I enjoyed High Energy, and thought that I would enjoy this book as well. However, I felt the author worked too hard to tie this book to the previous one. I would rather reach the conculsion that Tyber is pirate-like by seeing him in action, than having it pointed out to me every couple pages. This book was very sensual, a plus, however the sensuality was the main focus of the book and the story line/mystery was a distant second. If that is what you are looking for, you will probably enjoy this book."
5,WELL WORTH THE WAIT!,"Dara Joy's HIGH INTENSITY is the sequel to her highly charged HIGH ENERGY. Tyber and Zanita return full force in this tale of ghostly mystery. Not only did these two win me over AGAIN with their unique chemistry but the woven mystery in this INTENSE storyline had me holding on to my seat with my nose glued to every page. It is a definite must read. If you've never read HIGH ENERGY, buy it! It is the beginning of a beautiful and amazing partnership that is evident in book two. Highly recommended and enjoyed. Oh, and make sure you have air conditioning. Things definitely get HOT!"
1,Not up to to Ms. Joy's standards,"What a disappointment. Having loved all of her work,I was thrilled to see another Dara Joy novel on the shelf. But this one falls short of the mark. I thoroughly enjoyed Tyber and Zantia in High Energy, but this time out I found them trite and downright annoying. Zantia comes off as a total flake, and if I had to read one more pirate reference, I was going to scream. I continued to read this one hoping it would get better, and boy was I disappointed. This was just plain awful from start to finish - a definite pass."
3,High Intensity,"I found the book exiciting and exhausting just keeping up with the banter between our duo, you haven't disappointed me yet,but is it just me, I found little references to the matrix of destiny series, i.e. wizard named Yaniff as leader of the mythological stone creatures presiding in Tyber estate and the recipe for Blooey from the sentinels of Rejar? I look forward to the next exciting adventure of Zanita and Tyber, there will be more adventures? I would hope you also write a story about Zanita and Tybers friends, Mills, Gregor and Cody, they're dying to tell their own story."
4,Come on ladies!,"Come on ladies it wasn't that bad I thought. I do have to admit there were a few things I did not understand involving some of her other novels but other than that I thought it was fun. It's way better than most of the garbage that is printed out there. Don't be so harsh ladies, I know you were dissapointed, however so was I but it doesn't mean I'm going to completly trash the book. All I'm saying is that it does not compare to any of her other books. Give it a try, I dont reccomend paying full price but if you see it on sale...pick it up it's a funny light read."
4,An entertaining mystery,"I enjoyed this book. I liked seeing Zanita and Tyber's relationship grow. I'll admit that I got a little tired of Auntie, but I loved Hambone (the cat). If I weren't allergic to cats, I'd want one like him.The banter between the two characters was fun and loving, and the sex was hot. It was a great follow-up to High Energy. (Oh, and I was about halfway through the book before I realized I was actually enjoying a mystery book! Imagine that!)I hope that the next book will be about Mills and Gregor. I think that their romance will give off sparks! Especially with Dara Joy writing it."
1,Very Disappointing,"No offense to Dara Joy, as I loved Knight of a Trillion Stars and Rejar, but High Intensity was dull and difficult to follow."
4,High Intensity -- high standards,"Hey folks, it wasn't that bad. Granted, it doesn't rank with her top books, but it was fun to visit with these characters again. The trouble is, we have very high standards for Dara Joy and so anything less than spectacular is a ""disappointment"". It's still better than 90% of the stuff that's out there.Boy, you reviewers are a tough audience."
1,more like highly vague,"I found this book to be very difficult to follow in comparison with Dara Joy's previous publications. A total waste of my time and money. I thought the repoire between the two principal characters more on a high school level than an adult perspective. The 'banter' between the two was absolutely trite or should I say tripe. I would not recommend this tome to anyone should they ask. Maybe the difficulty lies in the comparison of this book as opposed to Mine to Take. I expected more for the level of experience. We could speculate that this book was written earlier in the author's career and was now being released? That makes more sense to me rather than an author's ability to pen the prose deteriorating to this level. Full of cliches I might be but I, as well as other buyers, deserve better. I will surely think long and look long at the next release before its eventual purchase."
2,I made it through the book--but.....,"I have loved Dara Joy's books in the past, and High Energy was one of my all-time favorites. High Intensity, however, does not live up to its name! Although it was amusing to read about these characters again, the tension and fun of the first book just did not carry over. I got to the point where if Tyber called Zanita ""Baby"" one more time, I would reach into the page and hit him. Ms. Joy should have written a book about Gregor and Mills rather than rehashing the relationship between Tyber and Zanita again. Not her best effort!"
3,Not up to Dara Joy Expectasions,"I have read all of Dara Joy's previous books, and thourly enjoyed them. This one however just wasn't as good. Everything seemed to be a repeat of the first book High Energy. In my opinion she should have skipped this book and written one about Mills and Gregor, two characters whose sexual attraction would make for a very interresting read. This is not a bad book just not the memorable adventure of her others. If your looking for a great book, you can reread over and over again and still enjoy, try her books Knight of a Trillion Stars, or Mine to Take."
2,MISS!,"Dara Joy has had a number of hits - but sadly this wasn't one of them! The storyline will leave readers who haven't read ""High Energy"" confused and wondering who these people are, why we should care about them, and what the inside joke is. I found I didn't care much for Zanita and Tyber and nearly gave up on this novel several times because I just couldn't follow the storyline.If you want to read Dara Joy at her best, I suggest reading ""Rejar"". There, you'll see Ms. Joy sparkle!"
4,"Welcome Back, Dara!","Zanita is just as ditzy,Tyber is just as hunky and the entire cast of supporting characters is just as eccentric as they were in High Energy. What's missing is the element of sexual surprise that was so entertaining in the first book, and the conclusion just seemed too much of a reach to tie everything together. Still, I'd rather read Dara Joy than just about anybody. I love her heroes, her dialogue and her imagination. Her books are EXTREMELY entertaining. I'm hoping her next will be Traed's story in the Matrix of Destiny series."
2,High Intensity Falls Flat!,"I'm probably going to get bashed by Dara Joy's fans, but this book is pretty bad. I loved High Energy, the first book in this series. The lead characters Tyberius Augustus Evans and Zanita Masterson sizzled in the first book and sizzle out in the second book. Ms. Joy spent around half of High Intensity recapping what had happened in High Energy. As wacky as the lead characters are, even they couldn't support such a lame plot in High Intensity. The only redeeming quality about this book is some new scenes between Tyber and Zanita and the reappearance of some wonderful secondary characters from High Energy.Will I buy the third book in this series if there is one? Probably in hopes it recaptures the spirit of the first book. Dara Joy has created a captivating couple in Tyber and Zanita--but please--give them a better plot!"
1,High Intensity= Intense Dissapointment,"As one of Ms. Joy's biggest fans, it greatly saddens me to write a negative review about her novel. The character's in this book have no chemistry, there is no plot, absolutely nothing to hold this book together. I believe this book was to finish up her contract with the publishing company, and this book is hastily written, most likely as a snub to the company. Hopefully William Morris will hang on to her (the new publishers) and keep her set on the Matrix of Destiny series."
2,very disappointed!,"I was eagerly awaiting this book from Dara Joy, whose other novels I have really enjoyed. Unfortunatley, there is something missing from this book - like a story! It is about two characters who already had their romance in the book High Energy. I really enjoyed that book, but did not think these two characters needed another entire book about them.There was not much plot, basically another ghost mystery, interspersed with boinking and arguing about getting married. I found the book hard to finish, and thought the heroine was annoying. She was ditzy, which was cute in the first book, but was too much in this one. I wish I had saved my money!"
2,Avid Dara Joy reader,It was a boring experience. Nothing like the previous Dara Joy books I've read. Maybe the next one will better.
5,What a great film,"Lost and Found in Mexico begins as a film about relocating to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico...showing us the beauty and aliveness of a town and its people...and then engages us in a much more profound and important journey, asking, ""How do we keep our heart and our truth as we live our lives?"" The film uses the personal as a doorway to the universal, is beautifully shot and has a wonderful sound tract. I loved it.Kathryn Wilder, Ph.D."
1,Not worth it!,This was an awful movie. I do not recommend for anyone. I am annoyed that it was so expensive and held little to no content information.
5,Amazing band .......... and back in action,"ok, so a little different than world circus, but still amazing. these guys just got back together and are going to finally get the recognition of a whole new generation of metalheads. THINK THIS is more progressive than WORLD CIRCUIS and the lead singer is different ........... but it still has the same Toxik thrash/prog. feel and Josh Christians amazing guitar work, and the new singer is very good and more dynamic than the previous .... good or bad thing ? you be the judge ..."
1,$55 Dollars for plastic??!!,"The title says it all--$55 for this?! It's a classic toy, but this price is beyond insane. You can buy the wood version by Doug & Melissa for under $10--unless this is a typo, it's crazy."
4,Well worth the affordable price,This is a must have for any infant toy collection! It is good from sitting up stage all the way to walking. My 18 month old still likes to play with it if she happens to see one.
1,My son doesn't care for it,"My son has had this toy since he was 6 months old. He's 11 months old now. He plays with all kinds of toys and enjoys them, but has never cared anything about this toy, past using the rings as chew toys. It's a pretty boring toy."
3,smaller,"This is significantly smaller than the ones sold at Toys-R-Us or Target. It's a mini version, I guess it's still okay but I was hoping it was the classic version."
5,Love this toy!,My 9 month old daughter loves taking the rings off and putting them back on. The top ring has little beads inside and she likes to shake it and hear it rattle. Very entertaining toy! Highly recommend.
4,No problem with blue dye.,"I bought this toy after a lot of deliberation. I was concerned after reading the reviews that name problems with the blue ring, and the blue dye getting into their children's mouths. However, the alternative products also had less than positive reviews, and the price was good, so I decided to take my chances. I am relieved to report that I bought this toy in January 2011 and, we have not had any problems with the blue ring. Perhaps there had been a bad batch, or Fisher Price has now corrected the problem. I think my son is too young to completely take advantage of this toy at 6 months, but we are looking forward to good times ahead!"
4,Rings make good bath toys,Well its overall a pretty good toy. My son was never interested in stacking with it though. The rings float in water though so I have been using them for bath toys. I think its a pretty good price and im glad that were getting some use out of it.
5,Best toy ever!,"We have many toys - expensive and inexpensive, and my daughter loves this the best. It was one of the first toys she was interested in as a newborn, and now at 1 year, she still loves it! She always wants to take the ""red ring"" with her on walks or if we go to the store. You can't beat the price. Buy one for all your friends who have babies!"
4,A classic toy at five times the price.,"The price is terrific for this stacking toy that has been around for ages. When your baby or toddler begins to develop hand-eye coordination, this is the toy to stimulate him or her. Obviously, you should be near your baby to make sure she does eat the rings for breakfast. A little teething is OK. You can wash this toy in the dishwasher to get is almost sterilize clean. My son who is 3 liked this toy a lot. He did not love it, probably because it was not a car or truck, but we certainly got our moneys worth, time and again. Highly, highly recommended."
4,"awesome for fine motor, less awesome for physics",PROS:* Classic design that little kids love* Stacking the rings builds fine motor skillsCONS:* Kids can't tell that these aren't donuts until they have a mouthful of plastic* Fisher-Price gives a poor representation of the electromagnetic spectrum (arguably inverting it and then completely omitting the violet end of the spectrum)
1,Paint from rings rubs off on baby,"My son loves this toy, he's 7mo and enjoys banging the rings together and chewing on them. Once I noticed his lips seemed blue and it was from the blue ring. I thought it was a fluke until it happened a second time and the blue color rubbed off on the base. I was concerned as I don't know what they color the plastic with and so I took it away. These toys have been around forever and I don't remember this being a problem. I'm not sure if anyone else has had the same issues."
1,BPA toy,"This toy didn't say BPA free on the packaging so I called fisher price to confirm and the customer service rep read off some standard reply that bpa is usually only present in higher levels in clear plastic toys - this toy clearly has a clear plastic topper. I told the rep that and he read another paragraph about how they follow the safety standards and blah blah blah there were only ""trace"" amounts and that it is only a problem in food or drink containers. What a stupid answer - what do small babies do with toys.... Put them in their mouths!! Educate yourselves parents! BPA is dangerous and should be banned in all baby toys. I bought the wooden Melissa and Doug stacker - safer and serves the same purpose. I'm not buying FP/Mattel toys anymore and I'm getting rid of the ones I already have."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL BABIES,"This was our favorite toy for a LONG time. Even before our son could stack, he loved to chew on the rings. Then the stacking came, as much fun as the chewing. Then more sophisticated stucking came along just stucking the rings on top of each other. The little balls in the top ring roll around, great rattle at first, then great interest in the movement. WOW, what a toy. We played with it A LOT for about a year before we moved on to more sophisticated stacking toys. Great price for such a great long lasting toy. Money well spent (if you buy it, we got it given, even better value for us). A MUST FOR ALL BABIES TO MY OPINION."
4,great toy,I bought this item for my 8month old nephew for chirstmas and while he doesnt know how to stack them yet he still enjoys playing with the rings and chewing on them =)
5,Must-Have,"What baby doesn't need/love this toy.My son loves to chew on them, knock them over when stacked and throw them. He also thinks it's very funny when you put one on his head or when I put one on my head.For the price--you can't go wrong."
4,Fun and learns something new,My son really likes this toy. He got it for his 12th month birthday and learns more about it every day. Not even a month later and he learned that the rings have to go into the hoops. He is now learning about the shapes.
4,No dye issues here and this one's a hit at home,"I had no idea there was a dye issue here and my son has been using this toy for months. Never seen a speck of blue dye anywhere (though I'm sure that would've affected my review). Since I did not have this issue, I can only speak from my own experience and say this has been a hit at our house and my son has loved playing with this toy for months now. I love that they've added the smallest piece as rattle too (an improvement from our generation's version of this toy). Durable, easy to play with - recommended."
4,My baby enjoys this!,My baby seems to enjoy this toy. She is 7-months-old now and has had it for about a month. She likes the top ring that is half clear and has little balls in it. I think this will be a toy that will grow with her for a little bit.
4,Perfect for learning Patterns.,"This toy is great for babies going into preschool. It teaches them patterns by sizes and colors. I do not find the game very fun, but at this age, babies don't need much for fun stimulation. This is also VERY VERY hard to break with its plastic. Another advantage to this is there are no small pieces for the baby to choke on. Buy this toy. It is flawless."
3,"A classic, but not a hit","I was really excited when my son received this toy as a baby, but he has barely played with it and the pieces are now spread all over my house. Our 1 year old just received a wooden variety & both kids have played with that one more then they ever did with the fisher price one. I'm not really sure why."
4,ENTRETENCIÓN,"Mis bebes juegan mucho con este juguete, les enseña a tener mayor motricidad y espero que lo disfruten mas cuando esten un poco mas grandes."
4,Fun for 8 month old,"My 8 month old son loves the bright colors of this toy, it kept him entertained long enough for me to get some housework done. Im not sure I would call it ""fun"" but he enjoyed chewing and throwing the rings."
1,RECALL THIS PRODUCT!! beware blue paint,"We received this as a gift. When I gave it to my 8 month old son, blue dye was all over his mouth and hands. I called Fisher Price to complain and they stated that they have not recalled the product since the dye was non toxic. They then refused to tell me what was in the blue paint. I did a search online and this problem has been ongoing since April 2009. WHY WAS THIS NOT RECALLED???"
1,Blue dye everywhere!!,"We love this toy and have been in search for one that the blue ring does not rub off it's color-- After 3 tries I finally went with a different brand. The blue ring on the fisher price set would come off on everything (hands, mouth, clothes) even after multiple washings-- Too scary since it kept happening with every new model I purchased. Finally bought a lead free wood type and they are not rubbing off color"
2,Diappointed,"The toy seems really great but my son has shown no interest in it whatsoever. He has it out over a month now and he hasn't gravitated towards it yet. He puts everything in his mouth, so i thought that maybe just to chew on it he would do that.I guess he just doesn't like the thing."
3,dangerous,"Unfortunately my expectations for this toy were not met. My 10 month old used the rings as teethers, and managed to chew parts of the rings off. I would later find them on the carpet. The rings became jagged, and he cut his finger on one."
3,?,This toy is great for babies going into preschool. It teaches them patterns by sizes and colors. This is also VERY VERY hard to break with its plastic. Another advantage to this is there are no small pieces for the baby to choke on. Buy this toy. It is flawless.
2,This product is dangerous...,"I bought this toy for my 6 1/2 month old. He is able to sit up on his own, however, like any other baby, he does fall over in all directions. So, when I gave him this toy to play with he was very amused by it and was thoroughly enjoying it, especially being able to CHEW the rings. Then I noticed that he could fit the yellow cylinder (attached to the base that you stack the rings onto) all the way into his mouth. So I was concerned for his safety that if he fell forward he could lodge it into his throat and obstruct his airway. I have contacted fisher-price and they are picking up the toy from my house for a full refund. I think you should not buy this for a baby that doesn't sit completely stable on his/her own, maybe not until 8 or 9 months old."
2,Boring and Ignored,My daughters had no interest in this toy. A couple of times I saw my youngest use the rings for bracelets otherwise it didn't get played with. It was a waste of money and I would not buy this again for another child.
5,Great toy!,Great for hand and eye coordination! We sit and play for hours with this toy. Child learns how to grab items which is very important. We also play 'donut toss' and of course practice stacking them. I have also learned that they are great for teething babies!!
3,"This has been a classic toy for many, many years","I chose this rating because there have been quite a few complaints about blue dye coming off of the ring. I just purchased this toy for my nephew for $5.00 at a store called Deals. I'm going to tell my sister to look out for any problems. Or better yet check the item before giving it to my nephew. Hopefully there won't be any problems. I'm thinking that there was a bad batch that extended from 2008-2009. We shall see. Folks, thanks for helping me to decide how I was going do this. I really don't want my nephew to miss out on this great toy."
3,can be dangerous,My 21 month old got one of the circles stuck on her leg! I had to cut it off with kitchen shears and throw it away. Luckily it was easy to cut threw. Is this toy suppose to teach my kid not to but her foot into holes?
3,Childhood toys remembered,"I originally purchase the stacking toy because it was one of those I remember having as a child. So far my son likes to through the rings around and I'm not even sure where they all are at this time. Though it is great to have a toy that teaches children to stack based on size, it would be more appropriate for children under 2 to have a toy that allows stacking regardless of order."
2,Most boring toy for both my kids - skip this one,"This toy was the least played-with toy in our house (had since birth of first child). Despite efforts to show them how to assemble it, it did not interest them. Go with sets of stacking cups, by far my kids' favorite until this day (fun in tub or playroom). My son did discover ultimately that the rocking stand for the donuts could be used as a hammer to hit his sister, then we finally got rid of this toy."
1,How Stupid am I?,"I can't believe I didn't look at the reviews before purchasing this toy! I'm a firm believer on reading reviews before making a purchase, but I failed to this time. I saw this toy and remembered it from days-gone-by when my babies were little. I wanted to get it for our granddaughter to keep at our house for upcoming visits. Who would have thought it would have been made of anything toxic??? How can Fisher-Price or Mattel or whoever get away with poisoning our little ones? It's unbelievable. I've already unwrapped this or I would have returned it. Big waste of money no matter how cheap it was. What am I going to do with it now? Moral... ratings rock."
5,Updated classic,"Essential, classic baby toy. Updated with rattle on top. Helps baby develop fine motor skills. A language skills tool when parents play along and talk about colors or attributes like larger and smaller."
1,Blue Dye Turned Baby BLUE,"My daughter was playing with the blue ring from this toy this morning, and I was horrified when I saw that her entire mouth was BLUE. I took the toy away from her, and immediately called Fisher Price. It is Saturday, and they are closed, but I did look at their website and saw there was no mention of the blue dye coming off these rings. I looked at other websites, however, and saw lots of pictures of babies whose skin has turned blue from these blue rings. These people stated they had called Fisher Price on the matter, but that Fisher Price has refused to recall the product. Please do not buy this product for your kids. Fisher Price says the paint is non-toxic, but that doesn't make it okay! Paint- toxic or not is NOT okay to eat. Do NOT buy this toy!!!"
3,not like I remember,"I got this for my son thinking it would help him understand the idea of bigger and smaller; that seeing the rings stacked out of order would prompt the notion that they should be arranged in increasing or decreasing order. Unfortunately, the center post is wider at the bottom than at the top so it can't be done ""wrong"". the only way for all the rings to fit on the post is largest to smallest. He got bored with it pretty quickly. My husband and I each remember being able to stack the rings any old way on the ones we had as kids. Seems like they've made this toy ""foolproof"". I don't know what kids are supposed to learn with this version."
5,FUN,My son just loved this toy. He was able to put the shapes in the right order at a very young age and thanks to this toy. Due to this toy he could figure out what is small and what is big. Which goes first and which goes last.
5,Love it!,"My son loves to knock this toy the second I put it all back together. Definitely a favorite his and ours (parents). The less engineering, the better the toy."
4,Rock a stack,"I got this for my baby daughter and she liked it for the most part. She likes to take the rings off, but hasn't figured out how to put them on quite yet. They are very durable rings. I know I've stepped on them quite a bit, but they are still great! The colors are wonderful and it helps baby with cognitive skills. She gets board with them easily if I don't re-stack them over and over again, but still worth the money. Definately a classic toy."
5,Don't know what it is about this toy....,"Looked boring to me - a ""stale classic "" - but my son can't get enough of it. I was also bummed when I saw they had changed the top ring, but it's been one of my baby's number one toys for the 12 months he's been here! Definitely a must-have."
4,Great gift for a little one,My kids had something similar when they were little and had a blast. I purchased this for a child from a family my work department was sponsoring for the holidays. Great stacking and size figuring toy!!
5,"My daughter loves this toy, something about it's round shapes and colors","My daughter is 7 months old, she loves this toys more than other blocks. I think it is the round shape that is easy to crab, and the colors are very eye-catching. The top red one provides some sound affect which spice up a little, too. The product is simple, low cost, and my 7-months one just loves it."
5,Classic Toy,"This is a classic toy that will be in use for months, if not years, for less than $10. How can you go wrong?My daughter still plays with this, and she's 2 and a half now. We got it for her when she was about 6 months old -- she loved the colorful rings, especially the rattle one. As she got older, she would practice putting the rings over the pole; she didn't care if they went on in the right order or not, she just enjoyed stacking them! Now, she tried to put them on in order, dumps them off, and does it all over again."
1,Burnt out in 30 seconds,"I purchased this product knowing it only produced dark purple light. When I put it in a socket (exact same wattage) and turned it on it slowly came on, produced good light, the you could see vaporization of something within the bulb. After less than thirty seconds it popped and never worked again. I would NEVER buy this light again. Ended up going to my local hardware store and buying more cfls."
1,Im not sure what went wrong :'(,"The light itself looked ok, not amazing.- It only worked 1 day- I ordered a second one that didn't work at all- Total bummer!"
2,The diameter of the threads is too big,"I bought one a couple of weeks ago. The quality looks pretty good.Tried to fit with my Delta shower head and the pipe fitting. One end fit very tightly with the shower head. The other end would not fit into the brass pipe fitting on the wall or in the ceiling.I tried some other fittings, no luck. For my curosity, I measured the diameter of the threads. They appear to be 0.2mm bigger than the angled Delta shower arm which I wanted to replace.I returned it today since I can not use it."
2,this isn't all that great,"this isn't all you think it is. you can hardlly feel any bass, and theres not enough speakers. plus, it takes up to much room. and you cant lay it down horizontilly, it has to stand verticly. I wouldn't buy it ( i did buy it, but I took it back)"
2,terrible,-Subwoofer and 4 speakers provide for horrible gaming sounds and explodes on contact-Simulates bad home theater experience while watching DVDs or CDs with very bad sound-Designed and styled for the PlayStation2 console-Space-losing vertical design1-Thats why I lost my ears: THE LEFT FROM THE SUBWOOFER AND THE RIGHT FROM GRAND THEFT AUTO 3 MUSIC. THE ENGINES WERE SO LOUD!
2,Very underpowered system for the price,"When my friend told me he had gotten some amazing speakers for his entertainment center, I was expecting the world. This tragic little system, however, is so underpowered I had no choice but to be disappointed. Even for digital speakers, these lack in power. The bass is disappointing at best, the mids are too strong and the highs tinny. For this amount of money, you SHOULD be getting one of the following:Cambridge SoundWorks FourPointSurround FPS2000 - this system is amazing, and the same price as this one.Altec Lansing 621 2.1 Surround System - another good system for the same price as this one.You need a couple audio crosses from Radio Shack for almost no money in order to connect either system, but the hassle is well worth it for quality sound. Otherwise, just go buy some Sony MDR v700s and never look at speakers again."
4,"Not the Best, Not the Worst","When I purchased this item, I did not expect the world. (For [the price] you shouldn't) It is basically easy to assemble and get started the quality of the sound is pretty good (For the person getting the noise when turning it off, turn the volume down first) The sound quality is good. My only complaint of the system is that the wires for the external speakers are not long enough, and I will probably need to get extenders for my own use. Otherwise, worth the $$$."
1,over rated!...,"Sweet Jesus this was horrible. It creates way to much heat and is over priced! If you really want a good sound system get one from Kinyo, they have a great 5.1 game zone system for cheaper. This system dosent have any mid-kick in the so called ""Sub Woofer"" and the speakers may look nice but are just ... plastic. Not to mention the speakers having no crisp sound. The wires arent long enough but it IS easy to put together and that is the only credit I will give them. Not worth the money!This is for people who like style and hate quality and sound."
1,buyer beware,"Ignore the previous messages from kids writing the glowing reviews. This system is exactly what you should expect for such a low price. Everything about this system screams [poor]. [Poor] plastic, tinny speakers, virtually no bass out of the sub. Keep the volume low or else you'll go nuts playing the action games. My tv has no audio inputs and I wanted to see if the sound would be better with this system. It's not. It's pretty much what I expected, but it doesn't even look nearly as sleek as the pictures show. Pretty much a waste of my money."
3,Something Better,If you are looking for a real surround system buy the Kinyo 4.1 or 5.1 home theater systems. These things are powerful and massive. Even though they are only 50 and 80 bucks. Just plug the audio outputs from the PS2 into them and bam-you got real sound.
1,3D Surround System,"I just have to say...WOW! Not in a good way, oh no. Alike others on this site I can't say ENOUGH bad things about this system. If you're looking for a no name brand distorted piece of crap...then today's your lucky day my friend. I just gotta say...If you want surround sound, get SURROUND SOUND! Bose, Klipsh, or something along the line is great. This piece of crap sounds like a handheld radio that you get in a cereal box...and that's sugarcoating it. And anyways..the last time I checked...you can't surround a room with only 3 speakers...much less crappy ones with plastic less sturdy than a disco ball...Horrible"
2,If you're gonna buy a Damn Yankees hits collection...,"getESSENTIALSinstead. What you miss out on with this collection is 2 great Journey-esque tunes, rocker ""Runaway"" and ballad ""Silence is Broken""."
5,One of my favorites,"This has become one of my favorite high energy background tracks. I listen to it while working and it rolls me right along.When I stop to listen, there is lots to enjoy. Interesting rhythms and melodies that are almost ethnic, but new to the ear.A great album!"
3,Knowledgeable book on a taboo subject.,"This book tells of the life and times of the one and only Mitchell Brothers. Considered by most in the porno film industry to be pioneers in the adult film business. The brothers made one of the first box office hits ""Behind the Green Door"" at about the same time that ""DeepThroat"" came out.This book also outlined the struggles between the two brothers. Another feature that recieves great emphasis in this book is their many legal battles that they have to go through. The thing that I found amazing was that they won their legal battles. Of course the book ends with Jim killing Arnie. A very close up look at the porno industry and the Mitchell Brothers."
3,sold it to buy other stuff,"look, don't get me wrong. if I'd still own this album I wouldn't sell it again. I'd give it another half star if I could. I got myself this after hearing suffocation (effigy of the forgotten - which I loved) and immolation (that album with the black & white angels fighting - which I sold), and finding the song disincarnated on a Rock Hard sampler. I loved the classical hymn element in that song, which I however missed on the album (can't remember whether the song was on the album or not). Gorguts is belgian classical death metal - because anyone could listen to this album for 30 seconds and say ""hmm..this is death metal"", however not much more than that. Slightly better than mediocre death metal, despite Morrisound-sounding-sound. Not as good as Suffocation or Obituary, or even Cavalera Brother's Arise by far though. In my opinion anyway. but still a classic."
5,A Classic,"I very rarely give books five stars, but this book is definitely worth owning. I would put it right up there with C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity and John Piper's Finally Alive. I borrowed it from the library but plan on purchasing copies for myself, family, and friends. If you want to understand what the cross means and how God's love and justice are compatible, read this book. I hear so many people saying God is love and he would never crucify his own son on the cross. Denying the cross is not an option. It is a reality we must all come to terms with, either in this life or the next."
1,Love the taste - Hate the hidden Trans Fat,"We love the flavor of this cereal; however, it has hidden Trans Fat. If you look at the label it says zero grams, but they are rounding the amount down to zero. The product contains partially hydrogenated oils."
3,Good story but too repetitive.,"The vampire hero Gabriel is enthralling. The heroine Sara is sweet and pretty, though not too bright. At several points in the story I found myself wondering what a character like Gabriel (once past the pity he felt for her initially) could find to attract him in airheaded Sara. Still, for plot and the Gabriel character alone I would have given this book 5 stars, except that the author kept having Sara(h) rehashing the same emotional dilemmas over and over again until I was throughly sick of her airheaded angst."
2,Wish I'd been able to get it through a library!,"I like vampire/paranormal romance fiction;it's among my current favorite genres.When it is well written, that is.Good plotting, great characters, a lil' hot romance, maybe even some (gasp!)HUMOR thrown in,and a good narrative flow.I don't think that's too much to ask for in todays' romantic fiction.This book is not particularly well written.I wish I'd been able to get it through a library. I definitely feel I wasted a bit of my hard-earned money.It's disappointing to be anticipating a few hours out of my working life, a little escapism,as it were, & have it be so amateurishly written.....it reads like it is among the very first books this author has ever had published. Maybe I should have looked up her published book list first...Oops!Oh well.Live & learn. And I did."
3,It's a lovely story but.....,"I enjoyed reading the story book. Gabriel was so nice to Sara, taking her to places anywhere that she wants to go. But I don't really fancy the reincarnation bit. I guess the story sort of took a down turn when Sara lives to her old age and she dies........And I was really hoping for there to be a cure for Gabriel....."
5,This is a must read for all vampire fans!,"Embrace the night was one of the first of many vampireromances that I have read. It is chock full of romance, intriguingcharacters, passion, reincarnation, and undying love. Gabrielwhich is the charming vampire, is a character that all womendream about! This brilliently mastered novel has capturedmy heart forever."
1,Why Can't customers in the USA get this book?,"Once again, and as usual, we Americans are not able to get to read a book that Europe gets. Why is this? Is this fair, I think NOT."
2,"Had Potential, but sadly lacking oomph!","This book sounded really good, and it probably would have been terrific if it wasn't for the constant whining of the main character. I mean geez for a vampire he sure acted like a baby. The book consisted of ""I love you"" ""Get away"" ""But I love you"" ""Get away from me"". One minute he wants the girl the next he tries to get rid of her then whines about not having her then gets her back...its a neverending cycle right up to the end. About half way through the book I was wishing Gabriel (the vampire) would just suck it up and walk out into the daylight.Not one of the better vampire romances, but if you like your main character to be a 400 year old whiney baby then this book is for you. As for the actual bloodsucking scenes they could have been A LOT better, seriously not what I was expecting."
2,Boring,"This was my first and probably last vampire romance novel. I ordered it because I'm such a fan of Anne Rice's early vampire novels. I thought combining romance and vampires would make for an interesting read. Was I wrong! I couldn't wait for this book to end. The characters are one-dimensional and the story/plot or lack thereof was dismal and uninspired. To make things even worse, the sex scenes were major dullsville. I guess the author likes to completely leave things to your imagination--which I'm sure is fine for some people. I'll take Jude Deveraux or Catherine Coulter's hot and detailed writing over this anytime!"
4,Good midcentury science fiction,"A solid series of stories about the first space explorations, as imagined just pre and post Sputnik. The first story, ""The Cave of Night"" is a classic, while the others develop the theme with recuring characters. Nicely written and developed."
1,Save your money,"I purchased the Targus ""Stow and Go"" mouse for my new Dell laptop. Out of the box it did not work. Battery wouldn't charge. Called tech support which was a waste of time. Got somebody that could hardly speak English. Returned the mouse and got a replacement. This mouse works but the storage for the USB connector is broken so you have to dig the thing out of the bottom of the mouse...piece of junk...wouldn't recommend this thing to anyone...spent a week mailing the junk back and forth and still am not happy"
1,Ink runs out quickly and cartridge can not be refilled.,I rarely use this cartridge but have to replace the cartridge every month or so. Printer software constantly reminds me to reorder a new cartridges. I have explored having the cartridge refilled and Walgreens would not refill it. I tried refilling the cartridge myself and the printer software would not let me reuse the cartridge. The print quality is good but the cost is too high to continue using this printer. I will be replacing my Lexmark printer for a Kodak. I don't think I will but this brand again.
4,Always fast shipping and good follow up about their products,Decent price by comparison and Fast shipping. There is no reflection on this seller when I say I would choose anything but Lexmark next time I buy a printer. All ink cartridges claim to be done when they still show at least 1/4 tank left. Most disappointed that Lexmark would take its customers to the cleaners so to speak! What's the big deal about a return program rather buy the 28A and just toss them.
5,Good way to save...money and the environment...,Great way to save some money. These refilled cartridges have the same amount of usage as a brand new one. Since the are recycled it also helps the environment. I have always bought these.
5,ink,They had quick service and good prices. The item was exactly as described from your site.Thanks for offering this item online!
2,Not compatable,The ink only lasted about 40 sheets printing then i got error messege saying the inkjet was not compatable!!!!! So it was a waste of MONEY
1,This products sucks!,"I have been buying from Amazon for a long time and getting good products ,but this product is the worst.Don't buy any ink cartridges from Amazon .This is the second time I have gotten a bad printer ink from Amazon.They will print out about a half a dozen pages,then run out of ink."
1,It's defective,The product is defective. I found it out when I was on plane to Taipei for a month-long trip. Don't understand why the build quality of these 3.5mm airline adapters are all so horrible :(
1,Do not buy this if you want what is on the picture,The product i received is not what is pictured; the one i received (more squared) doesn't fit in lufthansa planes
5,Great adapter!,Compatible with all airplanes (international & domestic) so you can use your own headphones instead of the sucky ones provided by the airplane. Highly recommended!!
4,"For the price, it's a good deal",I usually use Sebastian products but thought I would give this a try and I think it works nearly as well for the huge difference in price.
5,Wholesome Adventure,"I love these Spy Kids. By having all three movies in one folder, I can really see how these two young actors grow through the making of the moves. Also, it's fun watching Antonio Banderas in a different venue from what he usually does. He is a very good comedic actor. But, the way Rodriguez puts together these movies is simply works of art."
3,Kids love it.,The boys could not wait to dive into the movies Christmas day. We had quite a marathon movie watching night.
1,Doesn't work,"While I have no problem with the movies themselves, having seen them all before. I cannot get these discs to play on my Blu-ray. They get as far as the menu page and there are simply no menu buttons to select. Have to power down player completely to stop it. So for me the set is a total dud."
4,review of spy kids trillogy,"i love the movies, but the first movie was so scratched (even though it was new) that it didn't play"
1,disappointment,Dismal failure. Exactly what about this toy is supposed to be appealing? (was a gift) It's durability is unknown to me since it has yet to be played with.
1,BORING,"Not worth the time or money!! My child still has not played with this, and he's had it for 6-8 months."
1,Product appeared used,"Upon receiving my shipment, the packaging for the toy appeared to be used. The tape on the box was so old it was ""crusty"" and there was damage to the box itself. I ordered the toy as a gift and was embarrassed to give it. I opened the package just to be sure the toy itself was not in ""used"" condition like the box indicated. The toy itself was not very good quality at all. The bases were very flimsy and seemed like they could easily be pulled off by a younger child. I was very surprised as Fisher Price toys are usually very good quality. I would not recommend this toy."
3,Its Ok,I was hoping my son would be more into this toy. Its duable and as we expected. It shipped quickly. He just didnt think much of it.
2,Glad I bought it used and didn't pay full price,"I kept on messing with the toy thinking there must be something else to it- but it's just a bat, ball and stand. My 11 month old son likes hitting the ball (and has for a couple months) but he likes hitting anything with a bat. Not much to it, wouldn't recommend with so many other choices out there."
2,Warning: Small Pieces May Come Loose,"This toy has four small plastic decorations which may come off when the child strikes the base instead of the baseball. The decorations are small enough for a child to choke on. On the toy I bought, the yellow decoration came off EVERY time the one-year old child hit the toy. I recommend removing these decorations before giving this toy to a child."
1,Kind of disappointing... A simple ball would be more fun!,Dad played with it for 10 minutes. My one year old - zippo! Don't waste time or money with this toy. A boring dud.
2,Not a Great Toy,"I bought this for my niece for Christmas when she was 6 months old. By the time she was old enough to swing the bat at the ball on the stand, she was too tall. The stand needs to be taller. I do not recommend this."
1,one word....Boring,This toy was given to my son when he was about 9 months old. He never played much with it. The bat became a weapon against our poor unsuspecting dogs too. (as another person had mentioned) the little shapes on the base don't do anything. basically it just sits there.My son would hit it a couple times and then just leave it to rot. I would definilty not recogmend this toy.
3,So so...,I was expecting more from this product... Initially does not smell like a high end product. When you wear it it is really pungent on the skin and it actually hurts it. It is quite watery as well. The good thing is a later later after smell which is soft.
3,"By far, not the best episode","I'm surprised anyone would rate this episode above a 2 or 3.First) The episode is extremely short. The shortest episode of all of the Fourth Doctor episodes. I think the total episode is only 2 parts long and take up only 40 minutes show time.Second) It is really a continuation of the Ark in Space episode, with theDoctor going down to the planet to prepare for the colonists to embark onthe planet. So it is not exactly a stand alone episode. It really should of been included on a DVD with the Ark and Space episodes. Should not be included on a DVD as a stand alone episode, because it is not a stand alone episode.Third) There are a few good scenes in it, and I would say that it is worth watching. But I wouldn't go out and spend as much money as they are asking on Amazon to buy it, especially since this is not one of the best of the Fourth Doctor episodes.Fourth) My suggestion is to wait until this episode is sold as part of a set before buying it."
4,BBC: Lets put these in collections!,"I love Dr. Who, especially the Tom Baker years. The Sontaran Experiment is weaker than most, it's just a little unsatisfying. But why on Gallifrey doesn't the BBC put the episodes in season format in box sets? Please folks, don't make your US fans collect the epsiodes one at a time, complile then!"
2,"Honestly, this adventure is kind of awful","Okay, I've got to say that I rather enjoy the older Doctor Who episodes and even some that take place primarily in quarries, but this took running around in quarries to a new low. Seriously, all they do the whole serial is run around the quarry, get captured, get away, run around some more, get captured again, etc. It all feels like perhaps the Sontaran's are playing pretend with a bunch of captured ""friends"" rather than actually trying to learn about human biology. There is an amusing ending, but I feel it would have been cleverer if the Doctor had simply been trying to get the Sontaran to turn around so he could smack him in the probic vent. That was the way to beat them in The Time Warrior, so why not in The Sontaran Experiment?"
3,Not what I ordered,"I ORDERED THIS COWL FOR A 1995 S-10 PICKUP TRUCK. THE COWL THAT ARRIVED WAS NOT FOR THIS MODEL. I USED MY INGENUITY AND TECHNICAL KNOW-HOW TO MAKE IT FIT, SOMEHOW."
5,A Very Nice Surprise,"Nim's Island was surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much out of it, but it turned out to be one of the better movies of the year. I was impressed. Good family movie, or for whenever you're not in the mood for adult/suspense fare."
5,Great Family Movie,I recommend this to all families. It was truly a good movie and I did not have to worry whether it was appropriate for my grand children.
4,A Perfect Family Film!!!,"This was a really good movie about a little girl named Nim who lives on an island with her dad. She starts reading adventure books about an explorer named Alex Rover. After her dad is lost at sea, Nim asks Alex to come help her. Little does she know, Alex is actually agoraphobic and a woman, played by Jodie Foster. Nim expects someone like Indiana Jones. Alex goes through a lot to get to the island. Will Nim ever see her dad again??? If you love adventure and comedy, you'll love NIM'S ISLAND!!!"
2,GENERAL,"IN GENERALLY I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH PRODUCTS PURCHASED FROM AMAZON. UNFORTUNATELY THE DVD ""NIM'S ISLAND"" ARRIVED IN A NON-READABLE CONDITION, SO WE WERE UNABLE TO VIEW IT.BEST RGDS/GEORGE AGATHOKLEOUS"
5,Great fun for the entire family,I love to have my whole family (kids and grandkids) over for movie night. This is absolutely the best movie for family movie night!
1,"No man is an island... no kid is, either.","What a twee bit of carp. Yes, carp. The wide-eyed over-acting little girl was just a total kill on this movie. And the timing was a mess - the connectivity between characters a mess. Not even a kids movie - it's just a complete frog-in-a-blender mess."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This movie is sooooo boring! I was looking forward to watching it after all of the movie trailers made it look action packed and exciting. It looked like a really cute show. WRONG!!! The movie is boring and lame and all of the actors/actresses do a terrible job. I usually enjoy Jody Foster and the other talents in this movie, but they should have stopped filming while they were ahead and that was in the process of reading the script. Don't waste your money, if you want to see this show, rent it for a dollar or two. It's definitely not worth anything more than that!"
1,Excuse me... I fell asleep.,"YAWN. *stretch* What boring rubbish. I couldn't even get into this movie. I rented it and fell asleep because the story isn't done well, the acting is HORRIBLE, and it's just really not that interesting. Skip this one. Maybe a kid could watch it but I doubt a kid could even sit through the first 5 minutes of this waste of space."
1,worst movie of all time,"the movie was a big waste of time, also really bad acting, SPOILER ALERT nims stuck on an island all by her self with her father lost at sea,and her mother was swallowed by a whale. she comes in contact with this agoraphobia author over email she asks for help from the author thinking the he is an adventurer that kicks a bunch of butt like in the books that she writes, but she turns out to be wrong in the meantime she saves the island from overwieght tourists also the author goes across the world to find this island. she finaly gets on the island in the like last 8 minutes of the movie some help she was. it was just altogther a horrible movie spare yourself and avoid this movie if u do want to see it rent so you dont have pay 20 dollars"
1,OMG - I was so disappointed,"This is the worst movie Jodie Foster has ever done. The previews were so good. I think that at every opportunity to excel this film fails. It is very predictable and lame. It is also a difficult blend of deep and extremely juvenile. The kids that sat behind me at the theater were very confused by the agoraphobia scenes and when Jodie got to the island, it was as big of a disappointment as possible."
5,good movie,a real good movie 1 of the best that i have seen so far. Ever1 of all ages would love this movie.
4,Not Too Cheesy,"Nim's Island is the story of a father and her daughter living on a secluded island while he conducts scientific experiments. They would prefer that no one finds out where they live to keep their home safe.During one experiment, Nim's father (Gerard Butler) sails out to sea and gets caught in a horrible storm.Now Nim (Abigail Breslin) is alone on the island with only her pet sea lion and bearded dragon to keep her company.There's also the adventure stories of a person named Alex Rider that Nim enjoys. The author of the books (Jodie Foster) and Nim begin writing e-mails.Alex Rider is afraid to leave her apartment but she wants to go help Nim.This film is a good family film. There isn't a single moment of questionable content. Plus, it's enjoyable. (not too cheesy)"
4,Great Movie,"Except for a few parts, this was a great movie. There were two levels to the story: Nim is literally on an island, and Alex Rover is metaphorically on an island. My only question is where was Alex's life jacket? You'd think being the type she is she would have insisted on wearing one. And how did she manage to row in a monsoon?"
3,Wanted more!,"Sure it was great to see Gerard Butler, but this was just okay. Jodie Foster, to me, wasn't cast properly in this. It's a cute family movie, just rent and skip buying this one!"

1,nim's island,"Once again I got caught out on buying the wrong region, this does not play in Europe the 2Disappointed there is no clear indication or region."
5,Nim's Island,"This is a lot different than any of my other movies with Jodie Foster. I wasn't so sure in the beginning if I was going to like this movie but I ended up loving it by about a fourth of the way through it. There is a lot of action in it, especially in the last third of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes family movies. It's real serious at times and very funny at other times."
3,What a disappointment,"I was absolutely disappointed in this movie. I actually had wanted to take my Granddaughter to see this at the Movie Tavern, but am now glad I didn't waste the money or time. Just when you thought that it may go somewhere, it was over. I think the best parts of the movie were the ones shown in commercials. We love Jodie Foster, and this didn't have the core of one of her movies.. Don't buy this, rent it, so you don't waste your money."
3,Nim's Island,Very nice family movie....I would recomend this movie for all ages...very funny in parts and great views...
3,About the video quality of Nim's Island Blu-Ray version,"The story is on the unusal side. For children, this movie is good because there is no violence. But, I am disappointed at the quality of the video especially when this movie was released within the last 3 years. Quite often, it is not as sharp as I was expecting. For instance, the hair, the background."
2,I expected much more.,"After seeing the trailers, I must admit that I was expecting far far more to this movie. The premise is that Jodie Foster is persuaded to go to Nims island to help Nim find her lost father, and of course she is a fish-out-of-water type on this island. However, she arrives on the island in the evening, and the next morning father comes back, and the movie is over ! A whole 10 minutes worth of the movie. My thought was ""is that it ???, is that all there is to it ???"" . The grand adventure she is supposed to have on this island does not happen. Have movie making standards really dropped so much ? Very dissapointed."
3,Fell asleep half way,My kids love it.They laughed at most of the jokes but I fell asleep while trying to be a good dad and watch it with them on a Friday night.I gave it 3 stars because its not for me.
1,will never order from them again,"I was sent the wrong dvd, they sent me Secret of the nimth and not nim's island. Contacted sell never got anything back from them not even a sorry. I will never get anything from them again. Not at all happy. Order cause my girls love Nim's Island and they just got their tonsils out so it was a gift to keep them busy since they had to be in the house for ten days."
3,Accurate but not steel,"I have this watch for a year now, it receives the radio signal when in continental US and stays accurate to less than a second (I compare it to another radio controlled watch, they show the same time within fraction of a second, and I can't detect any difference). The watch is plastic, and thin metal layer covering it wears off pretty quickly. The watch does not have any features - no light, no alarm, but look on a bright side of it: this is good for battery life!My next watch is Casio G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch MTG900DA-8V -- not much more expensive but infinitely better -- hightly recoomend!"
1,"Newly revised price, but really lacking description","Imagine my surprise after paying 59.95 for a stainless steel watch, only to find that the watch is plastic and only the band is stainless steel. Now imagine that I go to amazon.com to leave a review and find that the description has been updated and the price reduced 42% on the day that I received the watch UPS.NEGATIVES---No specifications on water resistance to be found in the packaging. An LCD watch with no backlight. A silver plastic watch body.---PositiveIt is a really accurate time piece. An ok stainless band.Probably worth $29.99 for the geek factor for the atomic clock works.Skip it."
3,Good Product Could Be Better,"The La Crosse watch is a handsome watch. Advertised as ""stainless steel,"" it is not. The band is stainless, but the watch's finish is an aluminum paint that scratches easily and soon becomes disfigured if the wearer is physically active as I am. The watch case should be stainless steel. The watch face could be illuminated for reading in the dark. Addition of these two features would make a much more attractive product."
1,Virtually worthless,"I purchased this watch specifically for the automatic update feature as I travel regularly within the U.S. I've had it for a few months now and have traveled across all time zones and it has yet to update automatically even though the radio signal icon is visible on the watch and working. If it can't do the one thing I purchased it for, it's not worth anything to me.I do have a request in to Lacrosse tech support so we'll see if an update is forthcoming.Update: Apparently this watch is not designed to update automatically as you cross time zones so misunderstanding on my part. To my mind, without this function, this watch is not much better than any other watch."
5,texican2,"I would not be without this watch. Even when I'm not wearing it, it is useful to reset my non-atomic clocks and watches. This is the third one I have owned. The first one never picked up the signal again after the second battery change. The second one developed what seemed to be a leak that caused the face to completely blacken while outside in the sunlight. It would return to normal inside the house.Again, however, I wouldn't be without it and rate it 5 stars."
4,Plastic Case,"You buy an atomic watch, you get a plastic case. Why? It has a radio receiver which will not transmit through a metal case."
2,Warranty expired after 2 repairs.,"I bought this for my dad to replace one that had given him great service. He bought the original watch from an insert in his credit card statement, and it still works (kind of, when the digital display isn't jumbled). The watch case is plastic, and quickly lost its chrome plating. He was so enthused about it, I knew he would have found fault with aCasio Men's WV58DA-1AV Waveceptor Atomic Sport Watchwith a nice stainless case. Now that it seems LaCrosse is sticking to weather stations and other items they do well, I'll see what dad thinks of a Casio."
2,A huge disappointment,"If you're looking for a Jimmy Buffett concert video, this isn't it. I'm still waiting for one.This is a haphazard collection of some concert footage mixed in with some back-stage and practice sessions. If all you want is to see Jimmy on stage and off stage, then go ahead and get it. But if you want good sound, forget it.This DVD is not in Dolby Digital or DTS. It's not in 5.1 surround sound. It's not even in stereo. It's MONO - and muddy mono at that."
1,Jimmy Buffett,Do not purchase this DVD because it is the same as the Jimmy Buffett minimatinee. Amazon messed up this category big time and I ordered it thiking it was a second DVD. Now I am stuck with it because of their error
4,Tasty Treat from Margaritaville,"Minimatinee 1 is a kind of greeting card from the road. It acts as an appetizer leaving us wanting more. This six song offering from the Tiki Tour takes us to that magic world that only Buffett can creat albeit briefly.The production is good, even though we don't get a 5.1 Dolby mix. There are snippets of the tour showing off Jimmy's best set design in years and of couse the music. The disc includes the Alan Jackson duet It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere, Cheeseburger, Meet Me in Margaritaville, Tiki Bar, Knees of My Heart, and Fins. There is some good bonus rehearsal footage of Tiki Bar if you can find it.All in all a good low priced treat for the holiday season. But Jimmy please, release the whole concert in this format and your fans would be very greatful."
1,I gotta agree . . .,"If the well is dry, perhaps Jimmy should retire. I am saddened when I see yet another three live albums with 99 percent of the same stuff. Changing a verse and a few licks ain't enough to deliver value. Meethinks bubba needs a new marketing consultant. I (FWIW) think the Jimmy brand should be reinvented around small gems, rather than quantity. Just stop the greatest hits machine, and start making art again. I always thought it was clever the way Jimmy worked the brand. Now it's starting to give me the creeps. Jimmy needs to think more like Andre Agassi and less like Anna Kournikova."
3,England should be so lucky,"Why are most people complaining about this DVD? If, like me, you lived in England, you'd be grateful for any crumb of the great man. He's never played on the radio and I couldn't even begin to think when he was last in England. I'd give anything to be a real live Parrothead at a Jimmy Buffett concert but in the meantime have to make do with what little is available, for which I am VERY grateful. Whilst a full length concert DVD would be great, I for one am more than happy with this mini DVD. You folks in the U.S. should be grateful you have this treasure of a man in your midst!"
3,At least it's a Buffett DVD,"While I would've liked to see more music and different songs, I enjoyed it. It's got a practice session in which one of the guys is playing a Walmart bag. It's worth a look"
5,100% parrothead,"I do not no what everyone is complainig about the dvd is short but it did not cost $20 it cost $5 so quit complaining, you all must not be a true parrotheadyou guys probabley like kenny chesney to"
1,Greedy Jimmy,"Typical of his recent releases, Jimmy maximizes his profit while delivering little to his fans. He needs to learn to retain his current fan base, and quit trolling for newbies. How long till another Greatest Hits Jimmy? This is one 2 decade long fan you wont be selling anything more to.Thank god I have a dvd burner."
1,Money Hungry,Jimmy is getting greedy. My daughter bought the DVD for me at Christmas. Very disappointed in the amount of the content.
2,Throwing some crumbs out for the DVD people... :(,Please just re-release Live By The Bay on DVD so we can enjoy an entire concert!
5,lace and flowers,Great condition.liked it very much. This book was recommend to me. I am an Artist myself and item will greatly appreciate d in class.
3,GABLE'S TALKIE DEBUT,"Cash and Jeff come across an abandoned baby in the Painted Desert; both want the baby, but Cash claims it as his own. Over the years, the former pals display animosity in an ongoing dispute over cattle, mining and water rights. Meanwhile, the baby boy, Bill grows into a strapping young man........The real star of this Pathe antique is the beautiful scenery. The photography is beautiful in this slightly stiff production which is mainly notable for Gable's talkie debut as bad guy, Brett (who blows up Boyd's mine!) The now rarely-seen Helen Twelvetrees (yes, that was her REAL married name) plays Mary Ellen Cameron."
3,NOT EXACTLY THRILLED WITH THESE,Heel protector came off first day. Repairable by duct tape but not what you want to have to do on a brand new pair of boots.
4,Only one song,I knew what I was getting when I bought the CD for this one song. I wanted it in my collection because that song really rocks. The rest of the songs I just can't get into but for CD quality you got to buy the CD.
3,Head East is worth a listen,"I was impressed by some of the guitar playing. ""Never Been Any Reason"" is definitely the best song overall, while several of the others are quite good."
5,I grew up with these guys,I never thought I'd see Head East listed on Amazon! I grew up in the same town (pop. 2900) as some of the band members (Roger Boyd went to my high school). I loved this album. Loved seeing Roger in this outfit. Go Dude!
5,Imagination Plus!,"A great book to stir a kid's imagination. This books shows actual playing, and not just watching a toy/video game that does something. A great way to teach creative play and get get kids thinking."
4,Cute Book,We ordered this for our son who was graduating from the fire fighting academy - Cute paperback book. Only issue at all was with the delivery. It was left outside of the house and in the rain -- could have ruin the book but fortunately it was only damp by the time we got it.
5,A real joy,"This wonderful book offers a peek into the magical world of children's creative play. I love the tone, and all of the characters ring true. The mom is my hero -- I'm glad her patience and focus eventually pay off. The illustrations offer several ""jumping off"" places for conversations with the kids you're sharing the book with (""What does OUR vacuum cleaner look like?""). If you're lucky, you might even get a hug."
1,Pretty good book,"While both the plot and the characters were intriguing, I was disappointed that this tome did not truly uncover the reason WHY firefighters hug their moms. The character development started out with a lot of promise, but I found myself wanting more...Why is he wearing a raincoat? Why is he sliding down the banister? Why doesn't he change out of his pajamas? These questions need to be answered."
2,Condition of book,I was very disappointed in the condition of the book when I received it. I understand that I purchased the book used. But I did not expect it to look like it did. The binding of the book was torn causing all of the pages to fall out of the cover. I had to tape the pages together. I will think twice about purchasing again.
3,its's okay,"Good, but I had hoped it would center on firefighters a little more than it did, as opposed to other professions."
1,Sprung a leak after just two weeks!,"The quality of this hose is obviously lacking. It kinks easily and developed a pinhole leak after just two weeks. I only used it for watering my garden, and had used it maybe ten times before it started leaking, about six feet from the spray end. It also doesn't have a tight seal against the spigot and leaks there too, but I suspect that is from my worn out spigot and not the hose, even though my old hose didn't leak."
3,Works ok after the second try.,The first clock didn't work but was promptly replaced by the company and it appears the replacement works better. The first had a bad clock motor and was not returned to them. The humidity and temp has been set several times and is not very accurate on the good and the bad clock.
1,Not an outdoor clock,"I admired our neighbor's cool outdoor clock, so I bought this one. I mounted the ""weatherproof"" clock on the outside of our home. A year and a half later it is totally rusted out, and the cheap paper backing for the face turned to dust. I complained to their support line, and they told me it can be outdoors but has to be protected from direct sunlight, rain, snow, and other elements. So, it's a great INDOOR clock. I'm going to get a ladder and examine my neighbor's clock so I can find a brand that actually works. Don't buy this piece of junk."
3,"When shipping costs extra, this clock is not a good deal","It's on sale for about 25 bucks, which for this clock is a good deal, but when you add in the standard shipping, that adds a whopping $33.00 to the final price. So you're paying $58.00 for a $25.00 clock....what were they thinking? You can probably find this at Fry's or somewhere else for less money....."
1,LaCrosse Technology Outdoor Atomic Wall Clock,It did not meet my needs. It was too big for how I wanted to use it.I just order the wrong side. Sorry about that.
2,Misleading description of clock!,"I purchased this particular clock because it was described as an ""Outdoor"" clock. Upon receipt of the clock I read the instruction book and under the section entitled ""Frequently Asked Questions"" is the following:""Q. Can a La Cross Technology clock be used outdoors?A. Yes, but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 F andd 131 F. This clock is NOT water-resistant.""Living in New England, we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 F. The clock has a VERY misleading description!"
2,This clock is flawed,I bought this clock expecting it to: show the humidity in a room; show the temperature; and to set itself for daylight savings.It does neither of the above. The temperature stays at 60 and the humidity measure it always WAY off. In the same room I have an alarm clock that does all of the above accurately.The clock is attractive and easy to read and it keeps time ok. But it should do more.I am very disappointed.
2,I sent it back,Did not keep good time. The thermometer was never accurate although it was always in the shade the reading was always off by about 7 degrees.
5,"Fantastic, Accurate Clock","I've had this for quite a while and have it hanging outside under the eave of my house. The clock continues to be accurate as well as the humidity. The temperature may not be as accurate, probably because the clock is located in direct sunlight few a few hours during the day. We do bring it in for the winter. The display is big enough to see from across the yard."
4,Lovely and oh so accurate,"I really love this clock/thermometer/barometer.Tells the time, temperature and humidity all at a glance.I would recommend this clock. And, never a need to set the time.It is hung high and no need for ladders when daylight savings timerolls around which is a HUGE plus."
4,Times up but atomic bombs?,"I could not get the clock to set itself to the correct time. Not sure if I placed it in a dead zone but no matter what I tried it could not find a signal to set itself. It has kept good time since I manually set the time so I am not sure if the atomic part has kept it good or if it just hasn't lost any time.Having read reviews before purchasing, I knew to keep it out of the direct weather. I have it outside under a lanai and it looks very good, can be read from a good distance and seems to have a good working temp and humidity gauge.Dec 2010:Three years after purchasing this clock, it is still working. I also moved to a different part of the country and the clock auto reset itself to the correct local time, so the atomic feature definitely works, but it may find it more difficult to get a signal in some locations. I had to clean some rust off the top when I moved, but I could have probably predicted the rust if I'd paid more attention to the humidity gauge!"
1,Amazon won't refund my money on this product!,"This clock does not work! It will not keep the correct time. It is a lemon and when I went to do a return on it, Amazon says it is a hazardous material and therefore, I cannot return it! I paid $60 for a clock that has not worked since day one and I cannot return this?????"
5,It just keeps ticking,"This is an amazing outdoor clock. I've had it about a year and a half and haven't changed the battery yet. It keeps perfect time, but the temperature reads high during the day because it's mounted on a cinder block wall that heats up. It's been through windstorms and hail without incident. I live in Tempe, Arizona, where it regularly gets over 110F, sometimes up to 118F, but the clock keeps going."
3,a few fact corrections,"I have only just ordered the clock, so I will revise this when it is in service.The WT-3181P and WT-3181PL are NOT the same clock. The ""P"" is a metal clock (and cheaper on Amazon at the moment, for some reason). The ""PL"" is a plastic clock.According to the FAQ in the PDF manual on the manufacturer's web site, while not waterproof or even water-resistant, the clock is good for -10 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Not sure what all the talk about 40 degrees is about -- maybe I'll find out when I get the clock."
5,Great Clock,We just bought the second one. Got the first one 3 years ago from Frontgate for $30 more. It still works flawlessly. Has been outside the entire time throughout the New England winters. Keeps accurate time. Haven't even had to replace the battery yet. No rust or discoloration.
4,Doesn't work in Hawaii,"The clock has a nice finish, but setting it takes some time if you should have to do so manually. Most won't, but if you live in Hawaii -- do not buy this clock. You will need to set the time yourself and every couple of days when it automatically jumps ahead by two hours.I still gave it four stars because it keeps good time and I've more than once witnessed it automatically update the time very smoothly. The finish and mechanism are well put together. Minus one star because the numbers on the face are printed on a piece of paper."
3,a milder form,This dvd is tame compared to the other dragonball z episodes yet its still interesting and entertaining if you really like dbz.
5,Not much action but still good,"This DVD does lack the action of the other episodes but in a way, it's a nice breather. There is a brief series of action in the middle episode so it isn't completely lacking.However, it is probably one of my favorite set of episodes simply because of the character interaction. You get a look into the past with Gohan and see the bond between him and his father more which I love. Recommended to be sure."
2,INCOMPLETE,"If you are going to buy a clue book you would like it to be detailed and complete. Sadly this one is not. The Maps are crude and leave out many points of interest, and I found myself forced to use Westwood's on line messges boad for answers that should have been in this book. It will get you through the hardest parts of the game and the writing is witty, but I like a truly detailed step-by-step walkthrough at the back of a clue book so I know if I've missed some goodies. along the way."
1,what a disapointment,when I heard that a second greatest hits album was coming out naturally I got all excited cause I thought being a madonna album it would be well worth having boy was I wrong!!!!for starters the songs seem to be all radio edited especially human nature and that ruined them also there was no new material and I thought she whould have included some remixes of Don't cry for me argentina(the miami mix) and Beautiful stanger cause those songs as they are.. are pretty boring so having listened to it a few times my disapointment just got worse so I went down to the secondhand CD shop and sold it I prefer to have the original albums then this album which seems like it was rushed and no real thought was put into it
3,Good compilation but not enough... Sorry Madge.!,As everything Madonna's this CD surprises even the most die hard fans. It is still a great collection but not anywhere near Imaculate collection's status in pop music nor will It have the same impact IC had on 1990. It is just to comercial and it lacked the most emotional work of this great Pop Icon then again most of the best work she did this decade was not Great nor a Hit comercialy. If you have all of Madonnas CDs you wont be needing this one. If you asre a new commer you might be intrested. Nevertheless tha songs are all great and is a fun CD to listen to. I just would have liked it more were it more creative.Shes allready done trhee greatest hits.....
2,Unimpressed,"Ok, I am a HUGE fan of Madonna.However, I am so unimpressed with the GHV2.While it is a compilation of her hits from the last decade, there are not any new songs on this cd. I hate to say this but why waste the money, when you have all of the songs already!? She is not putting enough time into her career these days. Not that family is less important."
5,Madonna: 90's and Beyond,"GHV2 takes a retrospective look at the career of Madonna, from where THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION left off. Starting with ""Erotica"" all the way to ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"", this is a fair representation of Madonna's hits. Sadly no new tracks, but that's how it is sometimes. Madonna wanted this album out in Spring 2002, and said she'd do three new songs, and a new photo shoot. The record label wanted it for Christmas, so she said no new songs or new pictures. But you know its still worth having. It may not include all of her singles from the 90's but its a fair representation of Madonna's career in the 90's. The songs appear in edit forms, many radio edits, some in original form, some edited solely for this album. The booklet features a candid biography on Madonna in the 90's, and has an extensive supply of pictures over the years. Overall, this is a must buy, like THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. Essential for your collection."
3,It Was OK,"this cd would have been the best if only it had included ""Nothing Really Matters"" and ""Fever"". If I was in charge of making the cd i would eliminate ""Drowned World......"",""Frozen"", and ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" the songs that i mentioned at the beginning of my writing were way bigger hits than these ones."
5,THE HISTORY OF AN ICON,"This cd is a great introduction into the last decades' worth of music from the most famous woman in the record industry. Sure it has sloppy edits and the running order makes no sense, but everyone has their own version of Madonna's greatest hits. Madonna is more than a singer. She actually writes and produces her own music, unlike other big names in the music industry. She has truly earned her title as the Queen of Pop through hard work. It is all reflective in the songs represented her, and why this diva has staying power. True, it is missing some hits and singles released, but so did The Immaculate Collection(remember true blue, who's that girl?, dress you up, etc.), and nobody ever complains about that album. Madonna could easily milk her fans with a double disc replacement of both her greatest hits, but instead has offered us a sampler of her favourites. I mean, they're her damn songs, let her choose them as she wants. So hats off, and let's hope we get to see a GHV3."
4,"Awesome, as usual","I was very happy with Madonna's GHV2, although it would have been nice to have either some new songs or a few remixes of her old stuff. Otherwise, typical awesome Madonna..."
3,Not really worth the money,"I have to admit that I'm not the biggest Madonna fan. I like her music and have for years, I'm just not as big of a fan as most who would buy this. But, I do have to say that the idea of owning her entire collection of hits is appealing. This CD is simply not enough of a follow up to Imac. Collection. There are way too many songs missing. Even when compared to her Greatest Hits DVD, which has some songs this doesn't. Maybe it's time for a multi disc Madonna box set?"
5,Best from the best,"How many artists in popular music today manage to pull off 3 greatest hits albums in less than 20 years? Not very many. What can be said about Madonna's ""GHV2"" other than congratulations to her. This collection is filled with singles that have undisputedly become pop classics - ""Deeper And Deeper,"" ""Secret,"" ""Take A Bow,"" ""Frozen,"" ""Ray Of Light,"" ""The Power Of Good-Bye,"" ""Beautiful Stranger,"" ""Music,"" ""Don't Tell Me,"" just look at the track listing. Those cuts all stood the test of time - and then some. Also featured are singles that were only ""moderate"" hits but have become classics anyway (how many artists can say that about their lesser-known songs?) like ""Bedtime Story,"" ""Human Nature,"" ""Drowned World,"" et. al. The songs all speak for themselves. If you don't have this, get it. No pop collection is complete without it. Along with ""The Immaculate Collection"" and ""Something To Remember,"" ""GHV2"" is yet another chapter in a legendary career."
3,Still queen of pop but missing a few hits!,"I have been a Madonna fan for years! I agree with other peoples comments that the GHV2 CD could have had the tracks; Fever, American Pie and You'll see - on it! Drowned World/Substitute for Love and Bedtime Story are weak songs for a greatest hits album. I felt that the track Beautiful Stranger was not sounding like the original version on T.V.? Her Immaculate Collection CD was fair superior. Maybe she was in a rush to complete this project! It sure looks that way.Was this edit helpful to you?"
4,"Far from an imacculate collection, but still worth it.","""GHV2"" covers Madonna's incredible recording career since her last greatest hits set ""The Immaculate Collection,"" and it shows why she remains the most popular female recording artist of all time. However, unlike the ""Immaculate Collection,"" ""GHV2"" has no new material, plus it excludes some really good hits such as ""I'll Remember,"" ""You'll See"" ""This Used to Be My Playground,"" and her cover of ""American Pie."" Despite those concerns, ""GHV2"" is an otherwise incredible journey: her transition from the ""Erotica"" era to the ""Music"" album shows her growth and maturity as an artist. This, along with ""The Immaculate Collection"" and ""Something to Remember,"" are highly recommended for someone who's starting a collection of Madonna releases."
3,A bit lazy...,"I've put off buying this for so long simply because I considered it an extraordinarily incomplete set. It's been a long time since IMMACULATE and after the incredible fanbase she's built since then, one would think she'd give back a 2CD set. Anyone who knows anything about Madonna knows her record company had nothing to do with the sequencing or the edits; since when does she take orders? Where is BAD GIRL, I'LL REMEMBER, FEVER, AMERICAN PIE, RAIN, YOU'LL SEE, THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND, BYE BYE BABY(released down here in Australia),NOTHING REALLY MATTERS????? The tracks I've listed here would almost make up another CD! No QSound..no new tracks..it all comes off as a bit lazy."
1,only reason I hated it.,"Sad as it is, I'm really mad that Madonna decided to Remove the line in her song Human Nature. Anyone who knows this song will notice that a certain line is missing in the chorus. It's well done, but it's really isn't right to edit music like that. Madonna wants to change her image, but I haven't seen that change yet. She acts and looks the same to me."
3,Jumbled Collection of Legit Hits,"With the possible exceptions of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" and ""Human Nature,"" all of the singles on here are deserving of their spot on an album that is designed as a tribute to the second decade of an extraordinary career. Sadly, there seems to be little cohesion to this album. Perhaps it's a tribute to the diversity of Madonna's later works that this album does not work as a whole. Whatever the reason may be, this album comes across as a mix tape straight to you from one of the world's most recognizable pop icons. Thrown together with lots of hits, but little thought, it's fun but sloppy. Even the editing of the songs leaves you yearning for the original versions. And yet, no one can discount the power and importance of each individual song. It may not be as classically iconic as its predecessor (The Immaculate Collection), but like all poorly done mix tapes from old friends, it's special in its own charming way."
4,nothing new,"There's nothing new or exciting here. If you like madonna then you'll like this because you probably own all the songs anyway. However, some of the bigger hits are replaced by lesser hits but the lesser hits are bigger crowd pleasers (I was so excited to see the inclusion of the bjork penned 'bedtime stories', one of my favortite madonna tracks). So no disappointments there. The liner notes are cool but we've all seen the pictures many, many times before.I think this could have benefited greatly if:A)some or all the tracks were remixesB)all the tracks were continuously mixed orC)there were at least one or two brand new tracksIn any case it's madonna so you know what to expect. Buy this only if you're a madonna completist and MUST own EVERYTHING that she releases or if you're new to madonna (is that possible???). Odds are you either own everything on this disc or you already have the singles you like from this release."
4,Great,"There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity. I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."
3,Good Compilation,"I like Madonna, but I am not a Madonna fan. Therefore, I don't usually buy her CD's, but I do like to have the compilations that come out, since they usually have all the songs I like in one CD.Unfourtunatetly, this is not the case with GHV2. It does have some songs I really like, but it has some others that in my opinion could have been substituted by others. I especially would have liked to see American Pie on this CD.Still, it is a good compilation, and if you are a fan I am sure you will love it.If you are like me, you might want to check the songs included a few times before buying it.All in all, Madonna is Madonna, and since these songs had been previously released, there are no surprises, just good old Madonna songs!"
4,"Great ""sampler"" Album!!","This album is absolutely perfect for people who are not yet Madonna fans, but would like to get to know her music. First, go buy the Immaculate Collection, then come back and get this one. A lot of the songs are shorter edits of the original versions so this is a great sampler album which presents different types of music; from dance (Deeper And Deeper), to house (Erotica), to pop (Don't Tell Me), to electronica (Ray Of Light), to ballads (Take A Bow), and even r+b inspired (Human Nature). To all of Madonna's fans, quit complaining about no new tracks and wait for her new album. Leave this one to the general public!"
2,Very disappointing!,"I love madonna and I consider myself a true fan, but I'm very disappointed with GHV2. The songs included in this album are really great and do represent what madonna has been doing throughtout recent years. However, it does not bring any new material, which is a shame!I own all her CDs and singles and I don't need this GHV2. This is the album recommended for those who did not buy her CDs and want to have the greatest songs at home.I believe Warner should have released a greatest hits colection like ""something to remember"". It was also a greatest hits CD, but it has special remixes [w/massive attack] and unreleased tracks. I'm sure they have new songs of madonna, who were recorded and not included in ""Music"" album.Anyway, GHV2 will be good for some."
2,INCOMPLETE - Very sadly,"Where is: ""You'll See""? ""Rain""? ""I'll remember""? ""This Used To Be My Playground""? ""Bad Girl""? I'm sorry, yes GVH2 is a decent collection of Madonna tracks, but the omission of these, some of her biggest (and arguabley best) 90s tracks, is a crime for long time Madonna fans. I know she's been trying to make us forget for about 4 years now, but Madonna's wasn't always about cool European DJ's mixing songs on sprituality and inner peace. As a collection of her 90s greatest hits, this package really falls short."
2,Very Average,"Madonna to Me had a Better Run in the 80's to me.Her Material in the 90's to now hasn't really changed much.Her Image is still Her real Talent.Run OF Mill Material&Her voice is still Ok on a Good Day.She worked with a Slew of Producers&some things work&Others don't.the Last Record of Her's I dug was ""Bedtime Stories"" but She hasn't really challenged Herself as a Artist to me.She has soem decent songs this Past Decade but She had Better Overall material in the 80's to me."
4,"The Immaculate Collection,Volume Two","Since the release of THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION in 1990,Madonna has scored many more hits. Her teen idol days have long been over and in certain aspects,she matured. From 1992's EROTICA,containing some explicit content, are the the title track and DEEPER AND DEEPER. In 1994 came BEDTIME STORIES. From that album include BEDTIME STORY,HUMAN NATURE,TAKE A BOW and SECRET. There are more of her showtunes in this collection. DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA from the movie EVITA is based on the same play. BEAUTIFUL STRANGER is from the movie ""Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me"". RAY OF LIGHT tracks on this collection are the title track,THE POWER OF GOODBYE,DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE and FROZEN. From 2000's MUSIC are the title track,DON'T TELL ME and WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL. The CD booklet is packed with Madonna photos."
2,No new songs....No need to buy !,No new songs or remixes....WHAT ??? Don't I already have all of these songs un-edited on CD and MP3 ????
3,Good collection vol-2,".Its cool to see most here seem to really like this album, Its a good collection, thats to show Madonna is the queen and king of pop music. The only artist alive with 3 collections if hits and still charting after ghv-2. for instance 2002 (Die another day) peak at # 8 for 2 weeks on the hot 100. 2003 (American life) peak at #37 thats impressive. And (Hollywood) #1 on the dance and sales charts, and now with Miss Spears back on the hot 100 with (Me against the music), debuting at # 50 and word is that song will rise atleast into the top 20.WHAT'S UP!!! I graded this GHV-2, a 3 stars, Its good but she could had maded it better by adding a mega mix of all theses hits in one or end the album with a new track. Though not much promotion GHV-2 was able to sale over 167.000 copies its first week and nearly 200.000 by its 2 week. and to date, since 2001 it has shipped over 1.3 million copies in the U.S and now over 5 million world wide. GO MADONNA!!"
1,A real disappointment. . .,"I must be getting to be an old fart that doesn't like anything new or different. I was an early fan of Madonna. I even saw her perform in a ""raising star"" concert. I have her first four CDs which I really enjoy. Other artists, however, caught my attention and I began to ignore Madonna. My niece gave me an Amazon gift certificate for Christmas so I used it to buy this CD to see what I've been missing. What an absolute disappointment. Without a doubt, my worest CD buy in months. If this is one of her ""greatest hits"" CDs, I'm sure glad I stopped buying her CDs when I did."
2,Madonna: GHV2,"I was disappointed - I was looking for dance music. The Confessions on a Dance floor that also purchased was much more useful overall and I think better. Madonna is reasonably well produced, puts a lot of energy into her work but it is not A work - somewhere between C/B with a few songs B+/A- - Hung Up is actually pretty decent and the single has some interesting re-mixes."
4,If you like Madonna...,"... then you probably like this mess. Also, if you like sound of scum dripping from someone's face and splattering on floor after they thrown-up, then this is CD for you! Yay!"
2,Not So Immaculate,Madonna's best was during the early and mid-80's. This album proved that she jumped the shark by 1987 and has been famous for who she is ever since.
1,Not for Dizzy Gillespie fans,"I was recommended this because of my purchase of a recording byDizzy Gillespie. Assuming this is not the result of a paylola scheme ... let me say that this is of no value to Dizzy Gillespie fans.Therefore, I urge you to look further.As for Madonna,..., she is done. She never could sing in the first place."
3,"Great material, but omissions puzzling","This CD would rate 5 starts if it weren't for the odd exclusion of legitimate Top 40 hits such as ""This Used To Be My Playground,"" ""You'll See,"" ""You Must Love Me,"" and ""American Pie"" in favor of the flopped singles ""Bedtime Story"" and ""Human Nature.""Most puzzling of all is the use of the BALLAD version of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" rather than her disco version, which was a top ten hit! That above all else lowers this to a 3 star rating."
4,Asking for More,"Well, Madonna has done it again. With so many albums on her belt, she has succeeded in putting together another greatest hits compilation. Personally, having the ""best"" songs together in one album has its upsides and its so much easier to carry than a set of six cds.However! Madonna should follow-up on her You Can Dance! compilation and remix the greatest hits she's done for the dancefloor. Who would not want to buy a CD inwhich the remixes of ""Music,"" ""Deeper and Deeper,"" Vogue,"" ""Nothing Really Matters,"" ""Express Yourself,"" ""Justify My Love,"" ""Erotica,"" ""Beautiful Stranger,"" and ""Ray of Light"" are re-mixed into a seamless 75-minute 11-track cd.Definitely good for business! Definitely good for the ""older fans."" And definitely more money for you Madonna.Are you listening?"
5,GHV2 is a welcome addition to our CD library,"After recently hearing the entire collection via an Internet only broadcast, this was an easy buy. I don't listen to pop radio or watch music television programs and therefore have not been inundated with these songs over the past 10 years or so.We did see ""Evita"" though, loved it, and am glad for the inclusion of ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" in this package. As a greatest hits collection, there are many highlights here from the work of this great artist who we so casually refer to as Madonna.I'm thoroughly enjoying this CD and have found it motivating music to work by, do homework by, write programs by. Having said that, I'm surprised so many people are writing to say it offers nothing new. I understood this to be implied by the title ""Greatest Hits Vol.2"".This collection is a welcome addition to our CD library, the other Madonna CD we own being the wonderful compilation ""Something to Remember""."
4,A Great Collection!!,"I think this CD is excellent. Ok, so maybe it left off a few songs that I much rather hear than say Take a Bow or Don't Cry For Me, but it's a fun CD. If you're a fan of Madonna you have to own this CD. NO there aren't any new songs, but that's not what a Greatest Hits Album is for."
5,"""You're everywhere I go and everbody knows...""","Madonna GHV2 is a fantastic collection of her hits spanning from 1992-2000. Songs like Beautiful Stranger, Deeper and Deeper, The Power of Good-bye, Music, and What It Feels Like For A Girl are the standouts. Madonna looks so striking on the album, she is so photogenic! I also recommend The Immaculate Collection as well. Buy this cd today!"
2,She should have done something better for her fans,"There is no way that GHV2 could have topped the Immaculate Collection. Her later albums are more ""event"" albums, and do not meld together well like the first four did. That aside, this compilation could have been better. First of all, I know that a chronological order of the tracks might have been boring, but it would have made more sense to me in this case. Second, she shortchanged us on the good songs. Why isn't the Don't Cry For Me Argentina remix on here, instead of the regular track? What happened to Nothing Really Matters, Fever, American Pie, and You'll See? The Power of Good-Bye is a nice song, but it wasn't a very successful single, and could have been taken off to make room for a better track.Final analysis: Madonna must want us fans to make our own compilations from MP3 files, or she would have treated us to a better compilation, with a new single or two!"
3,wimpy,"This is not a showcase of her best work of the 90's. If you have no intentions of ever buying another Madonna album and only like or know the songs on the pop top 40 countdown, than this is the Madonna CD for you."
3,Almost but not yet.......,"Madonna's second Greatest Hits CD...Debuting at #7 on Billboard 200 and only going 1 platinum.......This is album is missing quite a few hits.....This pretty much sums up Madonna's 90's hits and where are the hits...Where is This Used To Be My Playground?I'll Remember?Yull See?You Must Love Me?Nothing Really Matters?.These are some of Madonna's best songs of the 90's...Especially my favorite I'll Remember....I hope someday she will release a box set with songs from Everybody and to the unwanted ""Sorry"""
2,No new songs,A good collection of songs but why no new songs or maybe a bonus disc with extra remixes. The price is too high for song you already have.
3,"A fine collection, but.......","It's pretty darn good. Actually, there are times where I've really adored it. But you know.....the song ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"" has always bothered me. 'Hurt that's not supposed to show and tears that fall when no one knows it?' -_- You gotta be kidding me. Girls openly spew their emotions all the time. And that's considered fine in society. They get sympathy. But could you imagine how people would react if a teenage boy or a man burst into tears at school/work? They'd never live it down. What this song is describing is far closer to the angst and inner traumas of GUYS, not girls."
3,I never liked Madonna,"I grew up in the 80's and I never cared for Madonna very much but this compilation of her greatest hits is very good. Her best work is ""Music"" and ""Ray of Light."" If you were not a Madonna fan in the past I guarantee you will be now. In reading the previous written reviews, stating that she is not a singer, she's chameleon - I totally disagree. She has a very good voice, no one can compare to her. Everyone sounds the same these days ie. Britney and Christina or Mariah etc. but Madonna has a beautiful unique voice. If you are sick of the manufactured music out there, buy this CD or better yet buy ""Music."""
2,"Madonna, Edited?!?!","I have been the biggest of Madonna fans for over seven years now and I was disappointed to say the least, to find out that all of the tracks are EDITED!!! Come on people!!! Has Madonna ever let herself been edited? I think not!! Let me know when the old Madonna comes back."
5,lo mejor de lo mejor esta aqui,"realmente soy fan de madonna desde pequeño (tengo 30 años) y siempre estoy al tanto de su music... ok o sea lo que venga a poner aqui es que realmente es buena. Sorry friends, i speak in spanish, but she is great, I mean She is the ONE."
1,"Madonna, I HATE u. Quit singing old lady",Madonna's cds are just a waste of valuable money. This cd and artist doesnt even derseve one star.
1,More crap from an old woman doing music for old people,Same old same old from Madonna. She mainly appeals to unhip people over the age of 47 now. She looked about 57 when this album was made.You can pick this one up and her others at the local used CD stores for $1.00. They have dozens of copies.
3,Could've been better,"I think most Madonna fans will not like this album, i did not, though i agree it should've been a two cd set realistically and finacially it was better to do one set, one explanation for the non inclusive tracks like american pie and you must love me are two songs that she did not have a hand in writing (royalties anyone??) another false move was to put in the edits of the songs, nor have any original material, i think this album was hastly put out without much thought behind proper marketing and appeal to the fans who consistently push her albums past 2million sales. hopefully, if shes wise, shell offer a double cd set in 3 years with better packaging."
4,Where's the rest???,"I love this CD, and since I don't have all the Madonna albums from the 90's, it's great to have a collection of random samplings over the past 10 years in Madonna history. I always listen to this CD and it is always in my CD changer, but one thing comes to mind, Where are the rest of the hits. What happened to ""American Pie,"" and ""Nothing Really Matters,"" which are two of my Madonna faves. Others like ""You'll See"" and ""Rain"" are availible on her Greatest Ballads CD, ""Something To Remember"" so I am not upset about the explusion of those songs. Besides these bad points, GHV2 is one of my favorite CD's and has other hits that make up for those expulsions like ""Music"" and ""Take A Bow"" and ""Deeper and Deeper."" Overall this CD is worth the money!"
3,Is it REALLY new?,"While it is a good CD music-wise and did come shrink wrapped, i am a little skeptical whether it was really brand new or not. First indication was the packaging, the lables didn't look quite right. When i took the plastic wrap off, i noticed the case was a little cracked in spots (ok, no big deal) but then i notices the case was not sealed with a label so i took it out and checked the CD itself. It has some scratches on the back. Seems to play ok, haven't had any issues with using it, but think it was either slightly used or maybe copied."
3,"Madonna gets 5 stars, but this CD gets 3","Madonna gets 5 stars, but this CD gets 3. The reason is she should've made an Immaculate Collection 2 that includes all her hits. You can fit them on one CD. At this point she's already done that with the ""Celebration"" 2 disc set which I recommend getting over this or even the Immaculate Collection. That set has about 95% of the big songs that you need. This Greatest Hits 2 is packed with great songs, but it leaves out key songs from this particular era, not to mention the order is scrambled and unorganized. Remixes should've been included. This was a pointless release and should've waited until ""American Life"" came out to ad those songs to this. Oh well. Love Madonna, but just not this particular CD."
4,"Exactly what I ordered, and in great condition.","This is a nice Madonna CD for any of her fans. The seller was also wonderful. They provided unbeatable prices, and super fast shipping."
3,songs missing,"alot of people are saying this disc is missing, ""you'll see"" , ""this use to be my playground"" etc. , but i consider this actually madonnas' 3rd greatist hits cd, because those songs and more are on her cd called "" something to remember"". madonna is missing alot of the songs that did'nt show up on immaculant collection,true bluewheres the partywhos that girldress you upangelcausing a commotionso i could only give this cd 3 stars, because these songs would have completed the collection of her hits."
2,Not an immaculate collection,"As a Madonna fan, I was and still am so disappointed with this album. It is my understanding (as stated on the fan club site) that she picked the songs rather than letting fans do so (like Bjork.) I like most of the original versions of these songs but every song on this CD is edited. I don't understand the running order either, i.e. why these song are in this order. I made a CD prior to this coming out and all of her singles from this time period and they fit onto an 80 minute CD. Why did they leave some out? Immaculate Collection was over 70 minutes long where this barely runs 60 minutes. Also Immaculate Collect was in order of release and fit so well. I think that is why Immaculate Collection is still selling records and this one has died off. The only good thing about this CD is the Booklet with a great collection of photos and a hillarious story. Sorry Maddy, you have let me down."
3,will work,"Nothing fancy, but will replace those old tires to resale could be at less cost we dont get much for this size bicycle."
3,"okay, but there are more natural soaps out there","I used this soap bar all up, but I didn't notice any particularly healing/soothing/nourishing qualities about it. Since then, I have found a number of much more natural soaps, without ingredients like Potassium Lauryl Sulfate or Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, etc. that are found in this soap. Also, in case anyone reading this is allergic to corn, you may want to read the ingredient list: when I bought it, this soap included ""Corn (Zea Mays) Starch,"" which may be problematic.Some sources I've found for more natural soaps are Tropical Traditions (www dot tropicaltraditions.com/organic_natural_soaps.htm) and Herbaria (www dot herbariasoap.com/faqs.html#i1). My sister recently also bought me a really nice soap bar on sale in Anthropologie, and it has a simple, clean ingredient list."
1,Ripoff,I paid 2.99 a fifteen ounce jar or roughly 9 bucks for three. Grossly overpriced here. Avoid this ripoff and look for cheaper. Also when measured out this fifteen ounce was barely more than an eight ounce cup. The fifteen ounces are not by liquid measure but by actual weight.&#128078;

5,Nobody Does It Better,"This is delicious. It makes a gourmet cook out of a novice. Put it on chicken, pork, steak...it is ca c'est bon. I wish I could say it in Chinese. We love it. We purchase it on Amazon Prime. Saves a trip to the market. Makes a wonderful hostess gift."
3,"Just Okay, Too Sweet","I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it's nothing special. For my taste, it's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking."
1,Guess I'm in the Minority,"I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance. Well, no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce. Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles. Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters."
5,AWESOME,"not truly spicy my 2 year old loves this stuff!great on chicken, even chicken nuggets, for spring rolls- the crispy ones and even fries.it's sweet and spicy all in one so very good"
5,What? All These Folks Are Right?,"I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars. Is something suspicious here?Nope! Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row, and I'm tough. This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around. Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness. I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure. Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you."
2,Plastic!!!,"Doesn't lay well, easily becomes a trip hazard. Nice size and pattern, would be good for camping or beach use."
4,DVD Information from the producers of COPS,"Amazing Video Collection: Blazing Infernos features footage shot by camera crews tagging along with firefighters. This video is part of the Amazing Video Collection series from the veteran producers of Cops, the godfather of ""Reality Television"" shows. Drama has always sought to create emotions vicariously in the audience by staging situations. Reality TV has captured the imagination of the viewing public precisely because the stakes are real and not imagination; producers love the genre because it's genuinely dramatic and inexpensive to shoot -- it's literally ""cheap thrills."" Sometimes the footage used even comes from scenes captured impromptu on home video camcorders. Highlights of this program include ventures into burning buildings, wildfires, burning homes, towering skyscraper inferno, and daring rescues."
4,Great songwriting from a hit machine!,Randy Goodrum has had a hand in writing some of the biggest hits in modern music. I mainly got to know his work via his collaborations with Steve Lukather the guitarist from Toto. Together they have written some memorable tunes and that's why I took a punt on this album. I like the music here but it's not the type of stuff that gets the blood pumping! It's very laid back for the most part but the quality is still high. The lyrics are very honest and heartfelt and the music is tasty. Steve Lukather plays a couple of nice solos and cool guitar parts so that's what interested me most. Good album overall but probably not essential listening unless you want everything these guys have done. The first track is particularly groovy though!
4,Not Alice in Hell,"If you expect every Annihilator album to be like Alice in Hell, you'll be disappointed early. Never Neverland would better with the vocal talents of Randy Rampage instead of Coburn Pharr, but it has its appeal yet.Firstly, I'm always impressed with the instrumentation on these albums. All of the riffs are brilliant, and the solos masterful. Songs like The Fun Palace, Phantasmagoria, and I Am In Command are among Annihilator's classics even to this day. The Never Neverland title track 'ballad' is wicked as well. All the guitarwork on this CD is incredibly well done. As for lyrics, they tend to be more moralistic, advocating against drunk driving, pollution, gambling, nuclear warfare, and corrupt religious leaders. The only out of place song was the goofy Kraf Dinner, clearly about macaroni and cheese. On a whole, I liked this album, especially compared to some of the albums to come."
4,Just as advertised,I bought this for my wife for her physical therapy exercises. It is a sturdy product which should last for years.
4,RemotePoint Makes You Look Good,"The RemotePoint Global Presenter makes driving a slide show easy. When the device is in my hand, it performs without my having to think about it, allowing me to focus on my audience and what they need to hear and see next. Anyone who's used a joystick mouse on a laptop knows what a dream it is to use once you're used to it. The laser pointer and slide controls are goof proof. My biggest issues with it came when I wasn't using it. Once I slipped it into a pocket during a presentation, and quickly learned not to do that; a little jiggle or bump and the slides would move! I set it down now. And since there's not an on/off switch, I've taken to removing a battery when I'm done so as not to deplete the battery from jiggling around in my travel bag. That said, the unit comes in a cleverly-designed padded case that includes an interior pocket to hold the USB antenna (and that battery!). I'm glad I own it."
4,Great product,"I work in a job where we use these ""clickers"" in various conference rooms, etc. This one has the ability to reach long distances (ie, if your computer is far away from where you are speaking) and handles the slides with ease. There is a pro and a con to this one though. The con is the size of it. It isn't very compact or light weight. The pro to that is if there is a presenter in one of our conference rooms, they aren't as likely to leave with this clicker due to it's size. We've had several of the small clickers disappear never to be seen again. And as many of you may know, you can't purchase the clicker with out the usb jump drive to run it - it's like losing 1 shoe, you can't buy just 1 shoe, you have to buy the pair."
5,Fabulous Remote!!!!!!!!,"Remote is easy to use. The laser pointer is powerful, unlike other remotes I have used. I would purchase it again in a minute, no regrets. You are able to use this remote as a remote clicker which is a bonus, though it is slow. There is a neat function to shut screen off during your presentation, though I have accidentally done it, so be careful; just touch it again and it comes right back on, no big deal."
3,less than desired,"upon arrival, the BATCAP plastic casing had been shattered. completely broken. i patched it up with some hot glue and re-sealed it then installed it.PROS:better than 1F Electrolyticno pre-charging to install, just hook it up and go - you won't blow any fusesCONS:case was completely shattered when it arrived - needs better packaging. much better.100F?? with 50-60A draw, there is still light dimmingno holding capacity (it can't hold its charge without a constant supply)1-3 minute charge time required before ""louder than normal"" operation due to above condition"
1,Do not buy!,"This product is awful. The first one hardly airbrushed any ink, and what it did washed out with the first washing. We returned it to Michael's and the second one didn't airbrush anything! I called the company listed on the box, Horizon Group, and they pretty much said too bad. We don't carry it anymore, and don't have replacement markers for it. They would not do anything to try to make it right. I wouldn't buy anything from this company again!"
3,Found a way to extend marker life,"My daughter received this as a birthday gift and the markers were dried out. I simply took the black end off the marker using a butter knife, added a few drops of water, recapped the end and voila! My 6 year old daughter is thrilled with it. When they start to lose their ""Uumph"" we add a couple more drops of water."
1,waste of money,We had the same problems with this item as everyone else. Our markers were nearly dried out and no other marker fit. We didn't get any color to come out at all. I threw the whole thing out and didn't bother trying to exchange it.
1,A real disappointment,My daughter just received this as a Christmas gift and was dying to try it out. The other reviewers seemed to have at least a little better luck than us - ours didn't work at all. She is now very disappointed. I gave it 5 stars for educational because my daughter learned a valuable lesson about product advertising - it can be very deceiving.
1,Didn't finish reading the novel.,"Got tired of the angst of the two primary characters and all the ""down time"" in the action. Asked my daughter about the ending and found it was not satisfying."
3,"Some great, some not.",A decent read. I read it for a class. Some of the information was decent but it is generally geared toward people that have no understanding of the postmodern worldview.My biggest issue is that some chapters flow beautifully and some chapters are like trying to run through neck deep maple syrup. I believe this is due to the multiple authors and their distinct writing styles.
3,Not as pictured,I like the product but it is not nscented. BE AWARE. My husband has lung problems and can't handle scented products. This is not unscented and they did offer to have me send it back but I didn't since it is a good product and I put it on outside the house when I leave so my hubby won't smell it. I would give it a 5 if not for the scent problems.
4,Discontent in the Medici Family,"I bought this book as a gift for my husband. It is a slow read but worth every minute spent. Remember this is not fiction, but history as it unfolded within the Medici family. Enjoy!"
3,A flawed masterpiece,"Of all Suzanne Vega's albums, this is her most flawed. The first six songs ""Penitent"", ""Widow's Walk"", ""I'll Never be your Maggie May"", ""It Makes Me Wonder"", ""Soap and Water"" and ""Songs In Red and Gray"" paint a brilliant portrait of a failed marriage, being a single mother, and the feelings of desolation everybody feels when major relationships fail in their lives. This is some of her best, most personal work.The album self destructs in the middle with ""Last Year's Troubles"" and ""Priscilla"" (""Priscilla"" sounds like something Suzanne had laying around for ten years and finally decided to record).Here's hoping that once Suzanne Vega gets her emotional bearings back, she'll deliver another great consistent record. For now, the first six songs stand as some of her best work."
3,I'm Longing for the Next Album,"I'm a long time Suzanne Vega's fan.She's just like a friend of mine since 1987 when I discovered the beauty of ""Solitude Standing"".Now I'm a little bit disappointed by ""Songs..."" because it doesn't sound like ""Solitude..."" neither the two last albums that I really appreciated. Yes, I'm fond of Suzanne's experiments and her ex-husband production. The songs were original,tricky, surprising and focused attention from the listener.Songs from ""songs in Red ans Gray"" are so anonymous because badly produced...Suzanne's song writing and voice deserve better attention. So I'm longing for the next opus (not in 5 years I hope so!!!)when Suzanne recovers from her divorce and finds a better producer...(Why not Froom?)"
5,even if im in love with you.....,"suzanne's 6th studio offering and as far as im concerned, suzanne vega can do no wrong!! this woman's voice and style is the first and best!! tori amos take note!! this new album is gorgeous and lovely just what is needed!! buy it and you will be better for it!!"
4,Wonderful cd!!,"This is one of the best new cds I have bought in a long while! I LOVE her vocals, the guitars, everything sounds great!! If you are one of her fans I highly recommend it! Even if you aren't familar with her but enjoy acoustic guitars and pretty harmonies buy it!"
2,So disappointed....,"....not with the songwriting or with Suzanne and her guitar, not at all. But the album is ruined by the treacly adult-contemporary production. The audioclips I heard of this album before I bought it seemed to emphasize the singing and guitar, making me ecstatic and hopeful for a return to pre-Froom production. Alas, no. The songs are drowned in syrup and soft drum-machine beats. This could be such a stark, powerful album, but it's not, and it's such a shame -- the songs themselves are gorgeous. I agree with the previous reviewer who suggested that she record a different version of this album live, just her and her guitar; the record would improve immeasurably by being stripped down to the best elements of Suzanne -- the guitar and the voice."
5,I Love It!!!!!!!,"Wow! This takes me back to how much I loved Suzanne's music when I heard the first two CDs, years ago.It is honest and intimate, like she'd pulled back clothing to expose a scar, sharing a painful experience, one that we can relate to and move on from, with this new tough skin protecting the flesh.There is just the right amount of instrumentation, so that the most important part, her voice, is never buried under tonal layers.Of course I'm biased. I love Suzanne."
5,"Simply, excellent","I bought this album during a time when I, too, am experiencing the loss of a marriage. How Suzanne Vega can write about domestic turmoil, including parenting, in such a creative and lyrical way is beyond me. These songs are much deeper than the usual ""he done me wrong"" fare of a woman's younger life.She is a mature woman with experiences that real women can relate to easily. She puts her poetry to music, it intersects with your soul, and her songs live with you forever more.Excellent album."
4,Suzie V is back!,"I never thought I would hear another album so reminiscent of ""Solitude Standing"" but here it is and I couldn't be happier. I never really cared for her work with Mitchell Froom and after their marriage, I figured the good ol' days were dead and gone forever. Not so! Granted, not every song is a gem, but I think it's at *least* 50/50 and well worth it for songs like ""Maggie May"" and ""Songs in Red and Gray"". As a person, I'm sorry she had a rough year, but as a loyal fan of 12 years I can't stop shouting ""Suzie V's back!"" from the rooftops. :) You go, girl!"
2,Buy the Sony TRV11 Instead,"I first bought the JVC 805U because I was enticed by the cheaper price tag, which I convinced myself was the only difference. It isn't. Don't be fooled by price -- pay the extra money and get what you pay for.I returned this model and bought the Sony TRV11. The video quality on the JVC is noticeably worse. This could be because of the lack of the Carl Zeiss lens or the lack of low lux recording (both found on the Sony).The battery that came with the JVC only lasted about 30 minutes (compared to about 1 hour with Sony) and the image stabilization was shoddy at best. Also, the LCD screen quality on the JVC is just so-so.While the JVC does have a built in light, it is really useless for night shooting.Overall, the JVC has average quality and features. If you are willing to settle for average and want to buy a camera in the ""average"" price range, consider this one or close competitor Panasonic. If you want a much better camera for a few hundred bucks more, buy the Sony TRV11."
3,very good miniDv Digital Video Camcorder,"very good miniDv Digital Video Camcorder in that price range (...). The unit is very light 1.3lb. Outdoor video is pretty good, but indoor isn't. Included battery is only for 30 minutes recoeding with LCD on. Remote control in very ugly, AC adaptor/charger and other accessaries are very rough, not Japan-made, the unit is just fine. Not 0 Lux, so video is terrible in weak light, the build-in light is useless at all in this case. I did not try still image mode, 640x480 VGA is not good enough for printing. Include software is for Win95/98 only, not for NT/2000. The indoor recording video is ""red"", you need to calabriate to write-balance to reduce this ugly effect. Summary: it is good enough for home use, but video and audio quality is just fair."
5,small but powerful,I bought JVC instead of Sony because of the size. The Sony cams are too large and heavy. The video quality is very good both indoor and outdoors. The audio is not so great but it is acceptable. The auto focus is good and zoom is nice but it could be better. Controls are well placed and the camcorder is very easy to use. Digital photo is very bad. The photos are not acceptable. It would have been better to not have it at all and the price to be a little smaller. Overall impression: very good. I am satisfied with it and it does exactly what I need.
2,told me to clean head and replace tape,"The picture quality is good, but some thing wrong withplayback, it keeps reminding you to clean the head anduse new tape (even it's new), and the picture is shaking. It happens from time to time, but not always.Software is no use at all for windows2000. A litle problem with the tape door."
4,Great Value.,"I bought this camera ... 6 months later, I'm STILL trying to figure out all of the special effects! Great video and sound quality. Only drawback: little or no digital stabilizer on the zoom. Buy a tripod for tight zoom shots."
2,troubles transferring still images from serial port,"I was quite impressed when I first used this camera, but after a few months, it's turning out to be a problem. I'm having the worst luck trying to download the still images on to my PC. Apparently, the enclosed software Multimedia Navigator(1 disc: JLIP VideoCapture | JLIP VideoProducer | PictureNavigator) does not work on the Windows 98 as it said, neither in W2K and Windows XP.I'm still haven't been able to download my pictures because my PC doesn't recognize the camera. Apparently, many people are experiencing similar problems with downloading their images. There is no drivers for this camera and JVC support doesn't know about this issue."
3,It's a good little starter camcorder.,"However, you will quickly out grow this cam. after a short while. The camera lacks mic inputs and headphone jack and some other necessary items for really good recording. That said if you want a reliable, inexpensive little camcorder this is a pretty good deal, but if I had it to do over I would look for the above features I mention in another model or brand. Do the research and find out what is important, so you can grow into your purchase and not out of it like I did. Just keeping it real. Good luck and keep the video rolling!"
2,Not as good as I thought,"We were very excited to get this camcorder, it took good video, but when we went to play it back on the television, you can hear the whirring sound of the camcorder thru the speakers, it really takes away from the sound you want to hear, for a $500 camcorder, i really expected better!!!"
3,review of jvc camera,It works but often an error E04 comes up where i have to take the battery out and put it back in and the camera sometimes will still not film or work and it should for what I paid for it.
1,just say no to JVC,"JVCs are great if you don't need any accessories or never need customer service. if you do you are in trouble. I bought a JVC video recorder last year and despite it being new it came without most of the accessories offered with it--things you'll probably need such as the cable to connect it to the TV and the one to connect it to the computer. I had to buy each of these for $40 each--they would not ship them, and also had to buy the software that was supposed to come with the camera. after all that, the leads broke and the camera started eating tape. the customer service was useless and I finally just threw it out. I had owned this JVC product for less than a year and will never buy another one."
1,Don't buy this,"I bought this in a few years ago and it worked fine for a while.But then it started giving the dreaded error regardingthe ""Cleaning Tape"" error and the cost of fixing this is $250!!JVC's customer support is non-existent.Moral of the story - pay more and get better quality."
1,Head Cleaning Disclaimer out of the box.,Within a few minutes of use I began getting a flashing message on the screen that the heads on unit needed cleaned.
2,"It's a good relay, but.....","What they don't state about this particular relay is the fact that two terminals are much larger than the other two. They won't fit any standard relay socket, and if you use this you will have to purchase larger terminal connectors for your purpose! Found out the hard way!"
1,A Terd....,"Wanted a temporary fix for my electric fan to get me home from vacation and this was WAY to temporary.... Running a 30 amp max in-rush electric fan (through a 30 amp fuse powering it BEFORE the relay) so IF this was a 70 amp unit as advertised it should have lasted longer than the three days it took to melt down.... Got a Bosch relay and it worked perfect for the three months I needed it to in Florida, and its still fine as a spare in my tool box.... The Hella isn't rated properly, no where near a 70 amp relay, maybe 30."
3,French Culture and Scenery,"Video Review - Cooking French: The Cuisine of Burgundy and Southern FranceFirst, let me tell you what 'Cooking French: The Cuisine of Burgundyand Southern France' is not. It is not a how-to-cook video. The videoshows chefs cooking traditional French cuisine, but it is notspecifically instructional. This Travel Channel video series alsofeatures French landmarks and some background information on theculture. Highlights include the preparation of coq au vin and asegment on the Beaujolais wine region.It's nothing to run out to the rental store tonight for, but it may beworth the time for those interested in learning more about Beaujolaiswines."
1,Broken Merchandise,My DVD arrived cracked on the disc and unplayable. When I left feedback for the seller I got no reply.
4,Great stroller for country living,"This stroller interested me because I was looking for something with off-road capabilities. It maneuvers easily over gravel roads and seems to have a smoother ride than a conventional stroller. The stroller is well built, with a metal frame, low-friction bearings, bicycle-like tires, and a large canopy. Also, the handle adjusts in height. I found this feature to be especially useful, as my husband is 6'7"" and would otherwise have to hunch over to push a conventional stroller. He also gets compliments from his buddies while pushing it, making it stylish and husband-approved.I'm currently using it for my 3-month-old daughter. I just added car seat head supports. The stroller has a 50-pound weight limit, which will make it useful for a long time.One downfall is that it is large and heavy. It fits into my Buick Lucerne's trunk with little room to spare (and it's a big car with a big trunk). I can't see how it would fit into a smaller car."
5,InStep Safari Jogging Stroller,I highly recommend this Jogging stroller. Very well made. Stable during a full run. Excellent storage area under the seat. The rubber wheels are quiet and have very good shock absorbancy. The adjustable height of the padded pushbar is very helpful for those of us who are taller. The padded shoulder straps keep baby very secure and comfortable. 2 thumbs up!!!
3,Wobbly buggar,"I was very pleased with the weight and ease of breakdown with this stroller, but once I started to get my energy back, I started to notice that the front wheel was very wobbly. As I started walking faster around my neighborhood, I found even locking the front wheel was not sufficient to stop the shaking. Perhaps if my daughter had been older and weighed more it might not have been an issue (used from 0-6months), but I'm not sure. I finally became too frustrated with it and bought a different stroller. I have yet to discover the ""perfect stroller"", but I was glad to leave this one behind. If you are looking for a lighter ""all-terrain"" stroller for casual walks or in stores, this one is not bad, but if you intend to do any kind of real exercise with it, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
4,Great and affordable jogging stroller!,"This jogging stroller may not have all the bells & whistles or long-term quality of the BOB, but it shouldn't for a third of the price! It is a great stroller -- very smooth, and our 8-month old loves it. Right now the riding position is perfect for him, and it's adjustable. Also, the kid tray is removable, adding to this stroller's convenience. Based on other reviews, we did purchase a Kiddopotamus Sunshade to supplement the shade that comes on the stroller, but we haven't had to use it yet. I don't think you'll be disappointed in this stroller, it's a great value."
3,that darn front wheel!,"Definitely agree with the warnings about that wobbly front wheel; I would still recommend the stroller for park walking/trails/off-roading- but if you are a runner, splurge and buy a more expensive model. OTHER then the front wheel my other dislikes are the harness the closure is sort of stiff and I have clipped my fingers painfully several times, the drink holders are worthless, the sun shade is ridiculous. I do like the easy open/close for such a big stroller its amazing how easy this was, I have a small hatchback car and it fits fine. Good overall padding for the kiddo, and nice storage ability for parent. Overall I am happy with my purchase but if i was planning on serious running or having more kids I would definitely have bought a BOB."
4,Great buy,I decided on this all terrain stroller based on the consumer reports review of it. I like the stroller so far. I have taken on a hiking trail which it was great on. I would not suggest using this in clothing stores or places with small aisles since it is a bit wide. But an umbrella stoller would work in that case. My daughter seems very comfortable in it. I do wish it came with a tether for saftey.
4,ahh...love it,"the feel of this album is amazing. imaginative, and overwhelming. excellent musicianship, and great hooks. i love the whole idea its a concept album too. i highly reccomend this album to any fan of metal. indeed, you must approach with an open mind, as you should with all things."
2,Boring,"A contender for the title of 'most overrated death metal classic'. The production is flat and dry, the vocals lack power, the frequent experimental interludes are annoying, and the actual songs are patchy. I bought this record as a spotty, undiscerning teenager and it bored me to tears even then. I unwittingly bought a second copy when it was bundled two-for-one with the masterful 'Consuming Impulse' re-release. If you really must hear 'Testimony of the Ancients', buy that same package, and then you can use it as a Frisbee or something."
1,Rambles through the land of narcotics like a lost tourist...,"The author leads us to believe that prohibition of drugs in any form is a terrible idea and is the reason why so many people are getting rich off of the drug trade. His theory has many holes and though I understand what he is trying to say, I didn't like his Marxist-style commentary. He rambles through the first 5 chapters like a lost tourist and has some very foolish ideas on how to treat the drug epidemic. Not one of the better books on the subject of drug use and abuse."
5,California Gold,An excellent hardcover copy delivered in a timely manner. But these continual and late after the fact requests for reviews are annoying and way to complicated!
4,Good Shape -- Apprecate this option,Received the book expeditiously in the condition advertised. I have nothing to complain about an received everything I expected.
5,Elegant and comfortable,"The first time I saw these boots I thought their price was too low, considering their brand (TH items are quite expensive here in Spain).I ordered them anyway, and I can say they're very comfortable and stylish, and they fit like socks to my feet. I love 'em! :D"
5,Excellent Product!! My husband needs 2 more - Size 10 black and Brown,Can't survive without this product....my fee and ankle do not hurt when I wear this shop. Please provide more sizes on your site as soon as possible. Right now you only have a size 7.
4,nice looking shoes,The shoes are really very well constructed and have a pleasant and elegant appearance. The only drawback they were not very comfortable for walkers.
3,"Quality fit, but sole marks heavily","This is a nice looking boot. Leather seems to be of a good quality. The only issues I have are that it is a very soft sole. It marks everything that I walk on. If my feet slide just a little, there will be a dark black streak under my foot. So you have to be careful not to walk on hardwood floors, light tiles etc."
1,save your money,"These shoes are really incredibly stiff and will hurt your feet. The soles mark just about every floor I have walked on. I don't understand why they have the Tommy Hilfiger label, they feel like cheap shoes you can get at Walmart. If you are still thinking of buying them, they fit true to size."
1,bad product bad company to buy from,I purchased this item for my father for christmas. One day later is stopped working completely. This product was sold thru amazon by Ritz Camera. It has now been three weeks since we contacted this company to either have the item replaced or refunded. To date this still has not been rectified. I do not suggest that anyone by any product by this manufacturer or from this company. In fact I think amazon should drop Ritz Camera completely. Each time Ritz Camera is contacted they tell you it will be 24 to 48 hrs to process the refund or replacement. Yeah we've been hearing that for three weeks now. Buy from them at your own risk. Thanks.
3,"My child loved it, but it wouldn't work past 2 weeks","My child loved it and so did I, but the first one, the screen would display after 2 weeks. I replaced it thinking it was defective, and the second one arrive 2 days before Xmas, and 4 days later it would continue to read Loading Disc.... It would be great if it worked, but it seems to have some problems. The sound was perfect, the car charger, the headphones, and most importantly the lock button to lock the functions."
2,"Avoid this one, wish I would have.","Bought two of these last Christmas for both of my teenagers. Long story short, they were both broken within one month of normal use. I purchased these because, admittedly, kids are hard on things and these things were advertised as being a bit more rugged. I was wrong, but you don't need to make the same mistake."
1,"Bad Product, Bad Company","Coby TF-DVD550 3.5-InchTFT Portable DVD/CD/MP3 PlayerDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. I originally purchased two of these for my two kids from Electronic Express, an Amazon.com merchant and when we received them, one did not work. I needed them for a trip we were making the following week, so I had to buy another one, making it a total of three purchased and return the damaged one for credit. When the third player was received, it came with the wrong power cord and the headphones did not work. I ended up sending all back for credit and I am still waiting. This company has terrible customer service and sells products that are not worth anything. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM AND DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!!!!"
1,a toy,"this product simply does not worth the dollar i spent on it. it's a toy. only used it for 2 months and it would turn on any more. i called the manufacturer they said it could be the battery. i did what they asked me to do with the batter still it would turn back on. there is no warranty to this product. if it suddenly has a fault, sorry, you would have to buy a new one. it's a toy."
2,not worth it,"The concept of this was nice but it broke soon after I bought it. My daughter didn't manhandle it and it just didn't last. The screen was small but it would have been ok if it lasted. Battery didn't last long either. Maybe an hour, hour and a half at best. When it did work it had a ""lock"" feature on it so kids can't keep turning it off and on."
5,My Coby is Special to Me,My Coby is the best gift I ever had. My Coby works really well. I like the favorite color of it and I like it very much. The screen works great and I can see it very clearly. I like the way the headphones fit my ears. It is really cool and you get to listen to music and watch movies so buy one for yourself!
2,Review of Gara's Pierce biography,"This is very dry reading. As well, there is almost no mention of Pierce! Instead, the author focuses on the issues/characters that shaped the times. These are crucial to understanding the political atmosphere surrounding Pierce's presidency, but a biography should focus on the individual. We learn next to nothing about Pierce."
5,Price and More Details,The book is two volumes set. The same book is available at a reasonable price. You can find the listing using ISBN 1895959152.
2,Okay....,"You get what you pay for. Overall, a good buy. But the shovel broke in a 4 dig outs. Better to build your own kit."
1,The Picture does not tell the story,Some of these tools are cheap China knock offs of Leatherman and others.If you want the best keep shopping.
4,Good for Camping,This is the best tool to be selected for camping. Easy to use and light to carry. Every thing you need for camping will be found in this package tools.
2,Death and Destruction overwhelm shallow characters.,Fast moving and filled with destruction but little suspense Savage Messiah failed to interest me because of the dull one dimensional characters from the noble prince to the old wizards.You know you're in trouble when the most interesting character is a conflicted assasin who's killing off the good guys and you don't care if the land is saved or not you just want to read more about her methods.Another problem is that the book is TOO grim.Sure in fantasy novels good should fight evil but there's so much gruesome death here it becomes numbing after a time.The writer tosses in a few sparks of joy every so often but it's not enough to lighten the blandly humorless tone.As a trivia note this book must contain more use of the word AZURE than any book ever written in history.To the book's credit it's an easy quick read full of magic and battles for fantasy lovers but it left me cold without any desire to see what becomes of the characters.
1,Can I get a refund?,"Like earlier reviewers, I felt the characters lacked depth and there were times where the narrative become so repetitive that I completely lost any interest in what the narrative was about.I have to re-read the original trilogy to verify this, but it seems like Robert Newcomb introduces new characters and elements into the series that seem to directly contradict the earlier novels.That aside, I was also very annoyed by the lack of foresight displayed by Tristan, Wigg, Fegan and the other members of their council. They talk about certain things that will happen yet they do nothing to plan in advance for them. And I'm no mathematician but how does does Tristian have any surviving forces left after all the calamities that befall them?"
4,Fun old exploitation film,The film print is from a vhs copy but no big deal. The movie is a fun exploitation parody of tv game shows and features a lot of 70's porn actors and I enjoyed it and hope that a label like a Code Red could pick it up and do it some justice. I think fans of early 70's exploitation films would get a kick out of this flick but would probably not be too thrilled with the vhs quality of the dvd.
4,A Pleasant Romp,"Roger Moore's committment to Sir Lew Grade for this show prevented him from doing DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. He could have been James Bond one film earlier. Such is life. A pairing of Moore and pot happy Tony Curtis as an English Lord and an American millionaire from the rough side of the tracks in a series of action mysteries still well remembered. Lasting only a year it failed to win an audience on American prime time -- it was popular in foreign markets. The fifth -- and final tv show -- Moore would do. For Curtis, his feature film days virtually over, he would go on to be comic side kick to Robert Urich's private Dan Tannna in VEGAS. Scripts and direction by such Brit stalwarts as Brian Clemmens, Peter Hunt, Terry Nation, Roy Ward Baker, Val Guest and even one directed by Roger Moore."
3,Very Corny - but a good theme song,"That is what I remember, the main theme song, which is very cool. The series, however, is very corny. The rest of the music used in the show is laughable 70's Hollywood interpretations of real 70's pop music. The outfits these guys wear made me laugh too, yeah - people really wore stuff like lime green ascots with green shirts in the 70's. Curtis' gloves were one of show's trademarks.The plots are very simple: two rich playboys chase some woman around and get into big trouble for their efforts.What is really amazing is how television has'nt changed that much. The Persuaders is fun to watch, Curtis and Moore work well together and the corny dialog is better than what passes for good dialog on cop shows today.Its worth a look at least once."
5,I thought this was a great book,I couldn't imagine being able to read a book that Florence Nitengale wrote. It was her journey in Egypt when she was very young and I felt like I was there.
2,What this Contains,"After looking at the sides of the webpage asking for an explanation of what was in the Cell Games Starter Set, it said in one of the explanations of DVD's that the Cell Games Starter Set contained all 9 DVD's, it does not. In fact you dont get to see any of the Cell Games, the first disk is talking about the Cell games and the 2nd disk is Gohan's childhood. I can't seem to find any complete box sets of the Cell Saga. Be forewarned. They got me."
4,One of a kind,"Great Kat (Katherine Thomas) has on occasions been brutally slaughtered by critics, because of her very high thoughts of herself. I think this is unfair. (But people with low self-esteem tend to get irritated at people who think well of themselves.)Beethoven On Speed is actually a good album, regardless of whether Kat is the Beethoven of the 20th century or not. Her guitar skills are good even if somewhat overrated, not only by herself. Although as fast as Yngwie Malmsteen and Vinnie Moore, she doesn't hit the notes quite as accurately.But nevermind, this is a fun (but short - 30 mins) record. And you have to give Kat some credit for doing something original. Where most metal guitarists just seem to be clones of others, she's actually doing her own thing. Classical pieces at hyper-speed!"
3,As Long As She Doesn't Sing....,it's kind of fun to listen to this. Guaranteed to starch the eyebrows of classical music buffs. But when she opens her mouth....this is one Kat that you wished stayed in the bag. I really give it 2 1/2 stars because of her wretched singing. Thank the devil a lot of the songs are instrumentals. Her web page cracks me up. It's so 80s.
2,"Amazing Guitar Work,,,but......","I purchased this album when it was new and was impressed.The guitarist is amazing,the rest of the band needs alot of work.If your a musician you can appreciate the talent involved here,just don't expect your friends to agree with you.I would have to recommend you hear this one before you buy it.Beethoven's Mosh is by far the best track on the album,and it flat out rocks."
1,the great kat,She is an awesome shredder but her singing leaves alot to be desired....not what i expected when everyone was comparing her to Yngwie.
2,disappointing,"after ""Prizzi's Honor"" I expected a lot from this book - I was really disappointed; it is boring, previsible and naive; the humour is almost absent and when it appears it is substandard; you can read it but don't expect much"
3,Deceiving advertising,I received what I thought would be a pair of crow decoys because that is what the picture shows when you order it. However the price was for just one decoy. And it does not tell you it is for only one. And since it was for only one why wasn't I given the choice to choose the one with open or closed mouth? IMO this is deceiving advertising. I will no longer order from this dealer for deceiving me. I gave 3 stars only because the crow is awesome.
5,Wonderful!,"This model kit is absolutely fantastic! It is a very involved, accurate portrayal of the cathedral. I have an interest in Art History, and have always had a soft spot for Chartres. When I saw this model I just had to have it! It is a fairly complex model with many detail pieces. Sturdy paper board. Overall, worth the money! Not a weekend project. This is a long term hobby! I just love mine."
5,If you have any interest in medieval architecture,"you'll run, not walk to buy this model. It is very well designed and easy to understand. Construction takes a bit of patience, but you won't mind as you watch the Gothic spires and buttresses take shape as the Cathedral rises before you. We made a pilgrimage to Chartres after the September attacks and found solace in this very pure Gothic wonder. The book has nice black and white photos, and of course, the glorious 13th century stained glass is not represented well, but a visit to Chartres itself would fix that."
5,A masterpiece in the truest sense of the word,"Without a doubt, this volume is the best word on jazz ever written. A sophisticated wit, coupled with a dry sense of humor permeates many of the entries, unlike many volumes about the music which talk down to the neophyte. Many of the passages read like literature--particularly when reading about Miles and Trane. There are very few omissions in this the latest edition. Only a few quibbles--Why so rough on John Coltrane's Live in Japan? Where is the entry for Mark Whitfield's work? Other than that this volume approaches perfection, and if this review helps sell more copies of this outstanding tome, my pleasure."
3,"No index, opinions a little heavy-handed","New to these sort of guides, but I was hoping there'd be an index for artist appearances as performers, not just albums under their name. I'm sure it would have taken a fair chunk of pages, but in exchange some of the entries could have been less ... belabored.Probably the first thing most of us do is look at the entries for our personal faves -- the entry for Blue Train says it's ""an over-valued record"" and goes on to put it down at length before mentioning that it was Coltrane's favorite recording. It makes me very suspicious that their ""Core Collection"" is going to bring out most of what I really want to listen to."
3,A Good Guide,"Cook and Morton obviously love Jazz, and this book is in many ways an impressive achievement. It is well written and a lot of effort has gone into its production. They are obviously very knowlegable about the music. If you like Blue Note music of the 1960's and ECM in the 1970's this is the book for you.I do have a couple of complaints.1)They are purists so a lot of records which I think of as jazz don't get reviewed, this strangely includes music by a lot of music British artists, such as Ian Carr, Mario Castronari and Phil Robson. They are also a bit snobbish about much of the output of Corea, Bley, Miles and Jarrett.2) My suspicion is that they are journalists rather than musicians, so their taste in records can be a bit strange. I have bought records on their recommendation and been disappointed. The Rough Guide to Jazz is better at identifying the key disks of the major astists."
2,Useful as a guide for two people only: The Authors!,"Don't waste your bucks or quid on this weighty tome, use allmusic.com or iTunes instead. Due to the two author concept, this rather opinionated effort (and the authors must be commended for a very big effort) is nothing more than the jazz opinion of two guys. They show little empathy for musicians they don't care for, and omit many who they do not classify as ""true jazz"" (whatever that might be.) At least allmusic has a team of reviewers who are sympathetic to the musicians they happen to be writing about. What's more, allmusic doesn't take the slightly smarmy approach that these two do. Forget it."
1,beneath contempt,"If this is ""dry"", ""sophisticated"" ""wit"" then the Three Stooges are E.B. White. Get a Schwann's catalogue and a ""Grove's Dictionary of Jazz"" instead."
4,Almost the oracle,"Probably the best reference guide to Jazz in its many forms, spanning almost a century of recorded music. Background info on musicians, and on individual albums, is both helpful and informative, and European Jazz is also well represented. As you might expect, gradings sometimes tend to the personal/idiosyncratic, but overall this is a sound, and huge (1725 pages) reference work in which you're likely to find almost all of the significant jazz acts.So why only four stars? Well, for one thing, the sneering tone adopted for many ECM artists (and a hatchet job on 'Arbor Zena'), plus the omissions of Danny Thompson, Mike Nock and Nana Vasconcelos, which I wouldn't expect in such an authoritative and expensive work. Still very good value overall."
4,invaluable resource... some rating questionable,I love this guide and use it all the time. It's truly an invaluable resource for finding the great CDs in jazz... especially for someone like me. I don't know many people who share my love for jazz. So finding out which CDs to buy is a chore... I trust the Penguin Guide to help me buy wisely when adding to my collection. ...
4,The Best Choice,If one had to decide between two books - this one or Visions of Jazz by Giddins - buy this one. Its essays on the players is at least as comprehensive as Visions. And the Penguin Guide avoids much of the pretentious gobblygook one finds in Giddins' book. I've owned the Penguin Guide since the early 90's and consider it indispensible. A great guide to purchasing jazz CDs and really fun to read.
2,Don't upgrade,"The previous reviewers have been 100% correct. While a first time buyer can't go wrong with the Penguin Guide, there is just not enough new content to justify upgrading from the 5th edition.I am actually quite disappointed in how releases from 2000 and 2001 are noticeably absent from this edition. Quite honestly, I feel ripped off for upgrading."
5,Outstanding,"I was a pretty recent jazz devotee when I purchased this book, and it has been worth every penny and then some as I have built up my jazz collection.The authors are tough but fair in their appraisals of these records, and I rarely find myself disagreeing with their assessments. This book has saved me a lot of money buying subpar records, and helped me to focus in on the truly outstanding material. I heartily recommend it to any jazz fan, especially one still in the beginning stages of building their collection."
1,Pompous Cynicism Not Even Expected From A Penguin!,"Aside from not being very comprehensive, ""The Penguin Guide to Jazz"" is marred by an ever-present pompous cynicism that one wouldn't even expect from a penguin! For a useful text, see the ""All Music Guide to Jazz""...for people."
2,Lots if info but boring opinions,"My wife bought this for me and I was excited to learn more about those I know and those I dont. After finding my favourites and reading these ""opinions"" on which records to buy, it became clear that these folks have a fairly narrow view of what jazz is (ala Winton Marsalis). While the artist information is interesting and useful, IMHO the opinions on what is significant is way off.For me, this book has become a tool for determining what artists I will probably like. If they pan something (0 - 2 stars), it's probably worth checking out."
4,easy to install and still working,I had no problem installing this power supply. It still working ok.Why four stars and not five? Because I do not know how it will work un the long run.
2,"Adequate replacement, BUT....","This is a compatible replacement alright for the Dell Dimension 8400, but IT IS NOISY. I would not recommend this if noise is an issue for you."
5,Glad this was available...,I used this to replace the original power supply in a Dell Dimension E521. It has more than enough connections and it fit perfectly although it does not have the slot on the side to attach it to the case as the original had. Remember to keep the four screws from the original power supply for installation.
4,"Lawrence, don't mislead people.....","Lawrence, please don't mislead people.(BTW, I am not affiliated with this product above, but a owner of Dell PC's and have done upgrades and done research on this subject!)If you don't use a Dell Replacement PSU, things can happen.....Yes, you can make less expensive PSU's work by cutting your case.Yes, the connectors will plug into all hardware.Most Dell machines have used and are using proprietary connection configurations, so you run the risk of burning up the new PSU and/or your motherboard if they are not compatable with the each other.Advice: Do your homework, use a Dell Replacement PSU!This is just a friendly bit of info."
5,Wonderful operatic technique exercises,"I do not own these CDs, but I worked personally with David for a summer and he is amazing. I came to him with polyps (blood blisters) on my vocal folds and, with the help of his healing vocal exercises, the polyps were gone within a month. He is a wonderfully warm teacher and I'm sure these introductory lessons give you the basic exercises that he uses with all his students. After earning 3 degrees in operatic singing, I can say with great confidence that David was one of the best teachers I studied with."
3,Dan'l Boone.,"Well-made and entertaining Indian tale from the 50's with former Tarzan Bruce Bennett as Daniel Boone and country singer Faron Young. A good Lon Chaney,Jr. as the Indian chief. But - alas - the Technical quality is very poor! Colors are bad in this edition. Try to find another one!"
2,Wrong product description,"Other reviews to the contrary, this is not 'Daniel Boone, Trailblazer'. This movie is simpy DANIEL BOONE. It stars George O'Brien, John Carradine, Heather Angel and Dickie Jones. A mediocre film in black and white from 1935. Take care if you're really looking for the film starring the 'Hillbilly Hearthrob', Faron Young. You'll be wasting your money."
3,Worth a dollar,"This film has been released by Digiview, the company which supplies all the $1.00 DVDs sold at Walmart. The source print for their transfer was in good condition and the color is equally good. Although, the print or transfer is slightly soft it is not distracting.This is superior to many other titles available for $1.00 and is good entertainment for the entire family, especially young children, as there are songs sung by children.It is both good and bad that you can buy this for one dollar. Obviously, it is great for the consumer but it just shows how fast the retail price has declined for DVDs and in turn that makes the business increasingly difficult for producers and distributors. Of course at a retail price of $1.00 it eliminates piracy, so you will not find less expensive versions from China or Korea."
4,Delicious tea--do I need the pretty can?,"Zhena's Gypsy Earl Green tea is a fragrant pleasure. The bergamot flavor of Earl Grey does just as well (if not better) with the good-quality green tea they select for this blend.You can pretty much count on any Zhena tea to be something special. I also like that the round, string-free tea bags are *not* individually wrapped. The attractive tins are both reusable and recyclable--but I have to wonder how much of the price covers the marketing design and the packaging. Apparently you can buy refill packages of tea bags, but I haven't seen them on Amazon (maybe I'm not trying hard enough). That quibble aside, you do get 6 more bags than in many of the cardboard boxes out there.Lovely tea!"
5,The smell got me!! (in a good way),"I'd originally got this tea @ a discount store, & when I got it home & opened it... the smell was so heavenly!! I love to just open & smell it each time I go for a cup. Ive gotten the girls at work the same way!! Now, I've ordered a case for myself & also some for the ladies at work! We are all enjoying this wondrous tea!! Will certainly order more!"
1,Terrible Tea,This stuff is undrinkable and the merchant still has not responded to my request to return it for a refund.It has way too much Bergamot in it.
1,What looks different isn't necessarily different,This DVD is same as Lyn's other DVD -- the only apparent difference is the photo on the container.
5,Great product!,Love the clear vanilla flavoring for making white butter cream frosting as it doesn't change the color of the icing.
5,Exactly as expected,"I was looking for vanilla flavor for a drinks, considering is made for baking most i know it is was little risky but price was good.It works really well.bottle opening is really wide was helpful to perforate the foil with small puncture to get easy dosage of flavor."
3,clear vanilla,"The product is OK, but I was looking for one that wasn't artificial. I'm not sure there is a clear vanilla that is not artificial. Thank You."
3,Not Bad,"Tough to compare them to any other band. The closest I figured was Megadeth-Symphony of Destruction and Queensryche. Progressive Metal I suppose. I like Novocaine Response, Social Syndrome, Testing Ground and Cults of Unreason, they're more on the speedy side. This band is a bit different, stop and go beats. Not overly heavy, rather light. Vocals come off as punkish, mid tone. Try Myspace and Youtube for samples. Had this on tape and forgot about these guys. Limited edition, gold disc."
5,Beautful Overview,"Being a Minister in New Jersey and a Minister in the oldest Denomination (the Reformed Church in America) with the longest, continuous ministry in America, this book was a quick and eager purchase for me and I was not disappointed. Greenagel certainly took the time to research the churches listed in the book and did a ""beautiful overview"" of the denominations in the area.Any lover of church architecture will surely want to pick up a copy of this book for his/her self and reference. The pictures are clear and the commentary on each church is enough to raise your interest as you read through the book."
5,Who needs the movie when you've got Desplat?,"I've been buying Alexandre Desplat movie scores on Amazon and I've only seen two movies he's scored! My introduction to the wonderful world of his music was for the movie The Ghost Writer. I was immediately entranced. Then I noticed he had done the music to The Queen which I enjoyed immensely. This CD of music from what I believe is a series of French movies is quite diverse in range and all of the songs are beautiful, drawing you into a place where you can watch your own internal movies. You can guess at what might happen, what danger lies ahead, what memory will rush to the surface, or what delight is in the moment. Desplat is quickly becoming my favorite cinematic music writer and these pieces just keep adding to that tally. As others have noted on other music releases of his, the music fits together as a cohesive whole even without the movie and with more musical range than dare I say, Bernard Herrmann, which is an astounding feat."
3,doesn't say what size it is?????,"If there was a size stated in he description or title, i would give it more stars, and even order it?????"
1,Reincarnation taken seriously indeed,"In this edition, by an INDIAN publishing house, some of the initial chapters are repeated! Now that's what I call taking reincarnation seriously. In this case an error, of course, and there are also missing pages that indicate a ""0"" rather than 1 star is justified for the product."
5,Great book!,"I was able to complete my dream deck with this book. It was the frist one I had built so I was a little apprehensive on whether or not it would turn out that great. But after getting quotes of upwards of 6000$ from contractors, and then never being called back, I struck out to design and build it my self. This book goes step by step through the whole process with great color photos and tips. I have used the 'Build Like a Pro' series for a kitchen remodel as well and really like their style. They are well worth the money."
2,Front Cover Photograph.,I want to build the craftsman style benches on the front. NOPE. No plans is this book. Just another frustrating tease. Are these bench plans some big secret?
3,My husband didn't even read it,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He flipped through it and it has sat on the shelf ever since. He didn't use one single idea out of the book. I'd suggest saving the money and spending more time on your own detailed plans. We couldn't really take any of the plans/ideas from the book and make them work for our situation. However, there were lots of pretty pictures. I suppose you could buy this just for inspiration. Then again, you could just Google ""decks"" and get a lot of ideas that way, too."
4,Riding with Boney,"I'm a huge Boney fan, I've seen him many times has come to the SF Bay Area to perform, I love his music. I love smooth Jazz of the type that I usually get from Boney and others of this genre, however with ""Ride"", he seems to be riding a little away from smooth jazz and more into R&B/Soul, I'm down with R&B , some funk and little Hip Hop, but I when I seek smooth Jazz I seek out Boney, with this CD I can't, while some of the songs are pleasing, with great beats, singing and funky, his Tenor saxophone is more like background music in this composition. It's his unique style of playing that makes him great, and he should never overshadowed by anyone on his CD like he is with Ride."
5,I wish I could give it a 10!,"Boney James is awesome. I like the artists he chose to collaborate with on this album. I bought this years ago but still find it soothing and refreshing now as I commute to and from work.#5 So Beautiful has been my all time ultimate ballad...the crescendos, the soothing, the rhythms....BEAUTIFUL as the title indicates."
2,A disappointment from a favorite musician,"I an a HUGE fan of Boney James. His music has a great beat, and the excellent choice of instruments make listening to his music while cruising Connecticut's Merritt Parkway a favorite pasttime. HOWEVER, I am disappointed with this album. I really enjoy the instrumental music. The persistant vocals in this album distract from otherwise good music (""All About You"" and ""Beautiful""). A couple tracks are stagnant - not typical of Boney James' work (""Somethg Inside""). I will applaud his efforts in ""Grand Central"" and the last track ""Untitled"" which I enjoyed. I am unable to replace my favorite album - Sweet Thing."
5,Good jazz music with different influences,"This is a great jazz album for those to enjoy who can appreciate modern jazz with a variety of influences, including hip hop and R&B. James pulls it off here with Ride. Standout tracks include Heaven, Grand Central (my personal favorite) and RPM. He has managed to unite devoted jazz listeners and urban audiences across North America, proving that music like his transcends all boundaries. All of his albums are full of his self-penned classics and anyone who craves jazz with an urban feel to it will enjoy this album from start to finish."
4,Smooth Ride!,"I know I'm late evaluating this CD and it's been out for over a year now, but it's still worth a review in my book! I've been a huge fan of Boney James now for over 10 years and I've collected all of his albums. I've even had the pleasure of watching him in concert here in Syracuse back in 1998. So it's a no brainier to purchase his latest album, ""Ride"".Right off the bat I noticed something different about this CD from past releases. There are 3 vocals that I have to tell you are good, but don't give me a buzz like in his previous albums. ""Heaven"" with Trina Broussard is listenable. ""Something Inside"" with Dave Hollister however does not do this CD justice. Maybe he should have left it for another album. The rest of the CD is flawless, vintage Boneyism! I love ""Grand Central"" and ""RPM"". With that said, Ride certainly is one you can take."
5,Boney is truely a multi-talented creative artist!! AWESOME!!,"I read with mixed emotions the other reviews of this album and all I can say is I love it!! As usual, there are some cuts that I like better than others, but the variations make it interesting. I disagree that Boney lost himself in this album. Granted, the primary thing that draws me to Boney's music is his sax, however, I too understand his feelings as an artist in striving to explore new territory and not get stale. Plus I share his affection for old school R&B. All in all RIDE is great!! It fulfilled all of my expectations and more. Keep up the good work Boney! Can't wait to hear RIDE live during his stop in Hotlanta!"
4,Awesome!,Once again the music will take you to various places and will keep hanging on every note. It is fantastic to have music motivate and consume you. Ride will do that for you!! You will be cruise along with Boney and the gang!!! Keep the music coming!!!
4,Jazz Review,"This album is a more mellow one from one of America's best saxophonists. From the first track to the last, the music is top notch. I also found a little surprise, an eleventh song. Boney James does it again with this one."
2,Disappointing..hoping it grows on you,"I was very excited to hear that Boney was getting revved up (hence the title) with this release (or so they said), given my disappointment with the Shake It Up collaboration with Rick Braun. This effort had me excited only to be let down. I do not understand with that Boney coming off one of his best CDs Sweet Thing and Body Language why he has to pander further to the smooth jazz/R&B vocals which go absolutely nowhere. Especially on this disc, the vocals are meaningless and are throw aways. Even the instrumental tracks seem over produced and superficial. I do hope over time this grows to be liked and look for Boney to get back with his original smooth sound, which is missing on this disc. In the meantime, I will stick to my OLD Boney and look to break out the Holiday CD soon."
1,Emphasis on Vocals Sink This CD,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am a huge Boney James fan and have all his CDs. Which is why I'm really disappointed in his latest effort. The main problem is the overabundance of vocals. One or two tracks would have been enough, but over half the album features vocals. I totally agree with the reviewer who said the singing gets in the way of the music. And in general Boney's playing just seems uninspired, like he was on a deadline to finish this album. I listened to this CD several times to give it a chance, but the magic just ain't there.I'm still a fan, but I'll stick to Boney's prior CDs. Boney, do your fans a favor and let your music speak for itself next time."
2,"Will the real ""Boney J"" please step up to the plate....","What happened to Boney James on this CD? I hope this release is not an early indication of what's to come in the near future. I do not like this CD! It's as if he's gone in a totally different direction. One of the things that I love about Boney is his ultra smooth & mellow sound. After listening to ""Ride"", I was left feeling bumpy and off-centered. The (2) star rating is me just being nice. Sorry ""BJ""."
4,Smooth and relaxing!!!,"This cd is very smooth and really does not require too much to enjoy it. Boney James did a fantastic job on all of the songs, and his choices for featured guests were masterful. One of the favored tracks on here is the title cut, ""Ride"" featuring R&B singer Jaheim. ""See What I'm Sayin"" is a solid groove featuring the mega bass stylings of Marcus Miller. This is a pretty decent CD for whatever mood you may be in. Whether you are grilling outdoors or going for a cruise, ""Ride"" will get you there!!"
1,Grave Disappointment,"I have all of Boney James' CDs and thought they were all great - till now. When I saw Boney was working on a new CD, I anxiously awaited the release of Ride. It was a big let down and no where as good as any of his other CDs."
2,Selling out?,"This is James' most blatently commercial disc yet. Moreover, the tunes lack the artistry of previous issues.I am disappointed with ""Ride,"" and troubled that Boney may have gone over to the Dark Side.Do YOUR thing, Boney. That's good enough for me."
2,Nice at first,"I could hardly wait to give this toy to my pet for x-mas. He did enjoy it while it lasted. As of Feb it no longer works and I don't see a way to possibly check the battery (if there is a battery) as the unit is contained inside. It was not handled roughly as I have a toy Brussels' Griffon. For whatever reason, it decided to stop working over night, and unfortunately, without the sound, my pet isn't interested it in."
2,"Beware the tail and head ""feathers""","I bought this as a gift for a good friend who has dogs. Within minutes, her dog had removed the hair from the tail and head, and he had started choking. She had to reach in and manually remove the ""feather"" from her dog's throat. The dog still plays with it -- but not until AFTER she cut the remaining hair/feathers off the rooster. With that removed, the dog can safely play with his new toy, and he loves the sound the rooster makes.I would advise that anybody giving this to their beloved pet trim the head and tail hair real short before giving it to your dog."
1,Multipet's Look Who's Talking Plush Rooster 6-inch Dog Toy,"I wanted the sound of a rooster, that is why I bought this dog toy, but the sound was not loud enough for what I needed. I wish I could have heard the sound first before I bought it. I didn't returned it because it's to much hassle. I gave it to my daughter for her dog to play with."
4,Not for bigger dogs,"Our German Shepard like this, but I was very disappointed that one crunch and it was broken. It would be fine for a smaller dog."
4,dark matter,"Marvelous performing, filmed in low light conditions. The set fits the music. Expect dark images, dark sounds, great performance."
5,The best music DVD ever,"The best...amazing production, incredible musicinship....great songs....You wont be disappointed....."
2,A Let Down,"First let me say that King Crimson are my favorite band and Robert Fripp is my favorite guitar player with Bill Frisell a close second. The first DVD is enjoyable and fun but nothing more and the second disc, sadly, is uninspired. That is a mortal sin for King Crimson. Even their performances are lead-like and somber. I don't know what the problem was, whether it was the particular the nights that they recorded or if it was getting stale for them, maybe it was time for Crimson to go into its hibernation period but I was shocked to watch people who seemed like they couldn't wait for the set list to reach its conclusion. There are so many Crimson performances that take your breath away and so many of their vinyl, CD, and DVD discs that are stunning that this set has left me bewildered: where is Crimson? I would recommend not giving a performance at all if you're just going to phone it in. Look elsewhere, this is not the real King Crimson."
3,I'll tell you Why,"I gave this DVD a 3 star because , i really liked there old staff, like: Walking on air, the court of the Crimson king , One more red nightmare and starless but , i am not a big fan of the new stuff. Now, if it was any other artist i would have givin him a 0, but , since this is the one and only King Crimson , i gave him 3. This DVD contains all of his new stuff like: level five, The Worlds My Oyster Soup kitchen Floor Wax Wax Museam and Dangerous Curves. I am not into that. When i buoght this i was not really happy, all the songs sound the same, but, never the less i still gave him 3 stars."
3,"Not Bad, but...","After reading quite a few reviews and speaking with several camera users, I decided to purchase this camera at a local store. At first, I was more than satisfied but quickly realized a couple of problems: Like most digital cameras, battery life is limited. With this camera though, the battery was almost empty after 12 pictures. To make matters worse, it uses a proprietary battery that is only available through their Web Site. Next, when using the viewfinder, my nose was always resting on the screen. Thus causing smudges all the time. All in all not a bad camera, but for the price there are better."
4,"Great, but has shortcomings","This is my second digital camera. The camera is excellent, however, the main disappointment is the zoom. Only 2,3X and is actually aspherical (so actually no zoom at all! )."
2,Not what I thought,"I thought this book was too good to be true for the price - and it was! If you are interested in this publication first and foremost for its text, and second for its images then you will be happy. However be warned for what it is - quite literally a black and white photocopy of the original 1902 publication owned by Stanford Library. The stamp on every other page saying ""Stanford Library"" adds to this authenticity!"
1,Just BLAH,"I originally deleted my review of the cd because I thought I never did this CD justice.I officially will never listen to this cd again. They are sellouts, phonies, and fakes! I saw them on conan perform. I thought he was kidding. He mumbled the lyrics the stumbled through the set. Then I went to Taste of Chaos. He wailed horribly. I was just outraged.Then Taste of Chaos DVD release. Ever band on there was recorded live. What did Senses Fail do? Dub over their performance except for the screams. How un rock! It was like a britney spears performance. I was just so shocked that they would have the guts to even think of dubbing over their performance when the rest of the bands put their vocals and hearts on the line and sang. Some weren't great but they were real.If you don't believe me, watch the Taste of Chaos DVD and tell me that the vocals arent dubbed. Any band that does that will never get my approval. BOYCOTT SENSES FAIL!"
5,one of the best bands ever!!!,"I've been listening to senses fail for 2 years now, believe me: It never gets old!! The music is just simply awesome, I'm loving every minute I listen to their music, buddy's voice is very catchy and the screaming fits perfectly, If you like bands like thursday and my chemical romance and you don't have the album yet, then go buy it now. it's one of the best emocore LPs I've ever bought. You will love every song on it!! can't wait for more stuff of this oustanding group, also make sure you checked out their EP, don't even read Reviews that give less than 4 stars!! they don't know what they're talking about"
3,"Not bad, but not great","I really enjoyed the first single from this album when I saw it on Fuse. Once I went out and purchased this album I learned that the this album is basically one song all the way through. I know that many people say that about punk albums, but I'm not usually one of them. Dark lyrics are fine by me, that's not the issue. It's just the same pace and basically the same song structure through the entire album. I for one can't really listen to it more than once, no repeatings here. I'm sure that lots of people really dig what these guys are doing and that's great. A little diversity would have really made me enjoy this more, but that's not to say it's a bad album by any means, just be sure that you have the attention span for it. These guys have their own sound and it's a good one...but they need to learn to mix things up a bit."
4,not christian screamo.,"First off who ever called this christian screamo is mentally retarted. This band is not christian screamo. All the lyrics are based of budhism and the ideas of it, however no one in this band is actually budhist.on a differnt note this cd is not too bad, it has its moments"
5,great album,"Anyone who enjoys punk/emo/(whatever you want classify it as) should definately go pick up this CD. If you liked From the Depths of Dreams you will appericate this album even more. This album stops the trend of second releases not being as good as the first (TBS,the Used,Co.&Ca)<==(these bands are still great, however their 2nd albums are just not as awesome).Anyway, the only average songs on this CD are 8-12, the other eight are very good. While this album isn't perfect it comes pretty close."
5,"First of all its a great CD, but...","I saw a review claiming that this CD has the F-Word in ""almost every line."" This CD only has it in it 3 times. This CD is great though, ""Choke On This"" and ""NJ Falls Into The Atlantic"" are the best. Also, don't call me emo. I listen to Metal bands like Amon Amarth, In Flames, Cradle of Filth, and The Haunted."
4,not badd,"i like emo there r a few bands that r terribla (afs, matchbook) and there is some good bands too (anberlin, copeland) this falls in the good list."
2,It Might Be Good If All The Songs Didn't Sound The Same,"I thought that I would be listening to some sort of amazing emo/screamo band that has so much diversity that some of you brainwashed sheltered individuals have mentioned. I found that every song had the same components; Four power chords, a slightly faster lead guitar melody(that happened to not be rememorable at all), and the frontman belting out some whiney notes.From the Depths of Dreams wasn't any different.I gave them 2 stars because they did get the components of a good song down. Just, none of them have any catch, or happen to be any good."
3,um...okay sure,"this album is kind of dope. it has it's annoying moments of cheap imitation music with the fake-pretendo emo. the voice is what gets me, it's that same nasal whiney voice. ok, now that the bad is out of the way, the good. the music has it's intense moments, the riffs are pretty good, it's not the best, but it won't make me want to vomit, like Matchbook Romance. this band isn't as extreme and intense as MCR but they aren't ass soft as MR either, so it's a good eclectic mix. that voice...dammit, it gets annoying sometimes. overall, this album is a so-so buy. if you have extra bucks left over and want to try something different, get this, if you already have something in mind you wanted to buy that, get that first. this cd is on a need-to-buy-cuz-i-need-to-spend-money basis."
5,Amazingg,"This CD is AMAZING. and plus it comes w/ a dvd which is also amazinggg.. I've been listening to it ever since I got it. It's one of those CD'S that you like all the songs. My FAVS are ""Tie her Down"", "" Bite to Break Skin"", "" Rum is for drinking, not for burning"", "" Choke on this"", and ""Let it enfold you"""
1,"sweet jesus, no",any band with a season or month in their name needs to be put to death. taking back fall out autumns sunday november boy need to stop. they will never be weezer or sunny day real estate and they need to realize this. only fat girls with no friends listen to this garbage.
1,whoaa possibly the most over-rated cd ever made,"this cd is probably the most over rated album of the entire year. i was actually stoked to hear them coming out with a new cd after i heard theyre EP ""from the depths of dreams"" and could only imagine what new grounds they would cover next. but as all bands are faced with which path to take, its quite obvious senses fail deffinatly decided to take the fame and money and make music that 13 year old girls would just eat up, put in theyre AIM profiles, and sing around school all day. All i can say is at least we can thank senses fail for contributing to over rating the scene just that much more. do ur self a favor and if anything from these guys go pick up theyre ep instead, then try listening to some good music for once and go pick up some albums from bands such as glassjaw, the bled, saosin and circa survive, even if u cant stand these bands then at least say u like them so u can look cool sense thats so important these days,good day"
1,Effeminate Music for Effeminate people,"Title says all. What's better, girly Senses Fail or ""actual"" music? Doesn't matter what era."
1,"Stop with the annoying cliches, puns, double entendres, etc.","You do realize that if you give this album a 5 that you are saying it is on the same level as albums such as Gun's and Roses -Appetite for Destruction, Use Your Illusion 1 and Alice in Chains - Dirt. Under no circumstances will a generic EP that made no influence on any other bands deserve a 5. There is no arguement about it. In fact they were influenced greatly by others. Even if you love this band, you can't justify it being as good as Pearl Jam's Ten, which is a sure fire 5. Unfortunately half the kids don't know who these influential bands are :(Don't buy this ep unless you are going to burn it. If I was rich I would personally destroy all copies of this. It would be well worth it."
1,8th-note bar chords,"omg....every song is the EXACT same!!! the intros are all really cool...then...""well, we cant write melodys, so...dun dun dun dun dun dun dun""; 8th note bar chords overlaped with cheesy punk singing--for every song...i mean seroiusly, if you took the melody from every song and listened to them at the same time....it would all match, every melody of every song is the same tempo, same rythm.. dun dun dun dun dun dun--bland omg....if you like listening to cheesy bar chords rythms, and weak kick-ins that are about as cool as a toothpick in your nose...this is the band for youi mean seriously, how does a band with so little writing talent get so popular?? i guess little girls like that poppy stuff"
3,lackluster at best,"To start off the lyrics are weak on this cd. If they are trying to be emo they better stop. Their last cd was gnarly. Loaded with hits. This cd has 3 songs worth listenting to: 10, 3, 5. And song 5 is like two years old. Their single is horrible just like the band. they should have stayed with drive thru where they made a good cd worth listening to. Taking Back Sunday is where its at."
3,An alright effort from EP,"First off, whoever says their lyrics are good are easily impressed. Now first off, i'm not one to complain about bad lyrics, but this CD has just some of the most terrible lyrics i've ever heard. Espically Tracks 4, 8, and 9. I usually just skip these songs. So what you can expect for in this cd, is maybe 5 decent songs with decent lyrics. They don't scream a lot like oooh lets say Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, or Finch. But the way he sings the songs are similar to Taking Back Sunday where he sings so fast that you can't understand what he's singing about. The first time I ever heard this CD, I couldn't stand the horrible lyrics, even though thats never bothered me before in the history of forever. But now i just skip the songs. Only buy this CD after you buy the new Used cd, TBS, and Hawthorne Heights. Then maybe consider buying this cd"
3,"Intensely catchy, but little substance","I bought this CD when I was supposed to go see The Bled and they were opening for this band. Naturally, I wanted to check them out. When I first listened, I instantly thought ""Great. More pop-punk with the violent lyrics screamed for added affect. Yay."". But there was something about this album that was different. Although I kept telling myself the album was the same mediocre garbagio that is being pumped out of Drive Thru records like tap water, I couldn't get the freakin' songs out of my head! What the hell? I now listen to this CD all the time. I am aware that a lot of the songs sound the same and the lyrics are some of the worst written (see: Buried A Lie), but as long as you don't expect it to be this great album with poetic energy and life changing passion, you'll get to enjoy a catchy-as-hell pop punk record with some forced-yet-fun breakdowns. Holla."
5,listen to one track and get addicted,"having gone through a lot of more local bands (new jersey is filled with them), i found senses fail when i was purusing through the drive-thru records site. their video single, ""buried a lie"" caught me by the hand and got me addicted to the strong rifts of guitar, screams of emo-core and intelligently written lyrics. if you're a fan of hawthorne heights or underoath, you'll appreciate senses fail. ""lady in a blue dress"", ""rum is for drinking, not burning"" and ""choke on this"" are what i see as feature tracks. give the album a listen and you'll want more and more."
3,Worth a chance...,"While not all the songs are great, Let it Enfold You isn't a horrible album at all. Sure, there are a few songs I skipped through, but overall, it's not as bad as some make it out to be. For a 2 month period, this album was stuck in my CD player. I eventually got over it but I still enjoy listening to it at times.However, if you don't enjoy screaming, this album might not be for you."
2,Annoying and overrated,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of their EP and the pop-punk/screamo genre in general. However, this CD had the opposite effect on me than it did to most people. It made me like Senses Fail less. Buddy's voice is really annoying. As for the rest of the CD, it's mediocre at best. Senses Fail creates really generic music that just doesn't really impress, nor really goes anywhere. There are some bands, like Hawthorne Heights, which are super generic but still manage to catch my attention.If you like mediocrity, go for it: mediocre instrumentation, lyrics and live show, but with singing that gets annoying.I'm telling you, there are many bands which do basically the same thing as Senses Fail but have a little more style. Why should I settle for this CD, which will take many listens to grow on me, when I could just find another band that can hook me the first time I listen to them? Therefore, this CD is just lame."
4,Senses Fail are a good band enough said!,"I agree with people who don't like these guys because they are cliche with the EmoCore wave taking the youth. However I personally like these guys, they don't have anything real special (except the lyrics) about them; good guitar riffs not great, good drums not great, decent bass, and like said before the lyrics are exceptional. But I dont think a great band needs to have awesome guitars or an unbelieveable drummer. All you need is guys who mesh well and make great music which is what these guys do. I think this CD is pretty damn good, good mix of everything this band brings to the table. Pretty much what I have come to expect after hearing From Depths of Dreams. On an ending note these definitely put on a hell of a concert."
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this CD yesterday for less than 10 bucks, and it is well worth it...this band has amazing vocals and screaming, catchy guitar riffs and sick drumming...standout songs to me are buried a lie, bite to break skin, slow song, and martini kiss....but they are all awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT NOW"
3,alright,"This CD is alright.....""Lady in A Blue Dress"" and some other sonds on here are good...""Rum Is For Drinking, Not Burning"" is one of my favorite songs....if you listen to this CD everyday.....it gets annoying....i listened to it for 2 days in a row and got tired of it.....over all if you like this band get it...if your gonna get it cause a friend told you too...listen to the friends copy first and make sure you wanna spend some money on it.....or burn it......."
5,ROCK FOR JESUS,"BEST CHRISTIAN SCREAMO RECORD EVER! IT ALSO CONTAINS THE MOST RELIGION AS FAR AS LYRICS, AND DOESN'T EVER MOVE AWAY FROM TALKING ABOUT JESUS OR CHRISTIANITY."
2,Give it a Break Buddy,"First off, I went to High School with Buddy. His mom is a former soap oprah actress and his dad is a major lawyer in the NYC area. I used to smoke blunts with this kid. It is really funny to see this kid have all this ""hurt and anguish"" in his music. This whole emo music movement is awful and Senses Fail is just adding to it. Buddy is all tatted up and 21 yrs old now, yet he is singing lyrics that the most immature middle schooler could relate to. Time to give it up chief and lets explore a music gendre that is a little more respectable"
4,At The Party!,"A fine and 100% ejoyable collection of grooves, from pure 60's party instrumentals to funky-disco beats from the seventies, but mainly furious soul, fantastic covers (hey joe, get out my life woman, land of the 1000 dances). Even a lovely children-sung cover of the classic garage anthem, Sometimes good guys don' wear white (made popular by the Sandellls)!"
2,A surprising edition....,"I received this volume just today. I have only skimmed through it, but I found it odd that the last page of the book is printed on the hard back cover of the book, and it looks as if it finished in mid-sentence. There is no notice or no hint that there is more to the book, almost as if a mystery novel had ended twenty pages before its conclusion. I found it very odd, just like the Warren Report: It first established a conclusion, and then mixed up the real facts and the ""facts"" to make it fit the already established conclusion. I will look elsewhere for the entire Warren Report, which I believe is several volumes in total."
3,Kennedy asassination,This is a historical book that we wanted in our collection. The condition of the book was fair to good.
1,Who would actually buy this anyway?,"Nobody actually believes Oswald acted alone anyway, I know I don't.The Single Bullet Theory is a joke, Arlen Spectre must've been on LSD when he thought that one up.The JFK Assassination was covered up to protect certain information from getting out in case the American public thought Cuba did it and demanded we go in there and bomb them back to the stone age, which would have pissed off Russia and thrown us into WWIII.But this whole thing goes way deeper than that, way deeper than the Warren Report will ever tell you.Don't waste your money."
1,eww...yeah...,I have to agree with her. this outfit IS pretty ugly. It dosn't even match!!!!!!!!!!!! UGLY! and its a MICRO-MINI skirt (BRATZ never wear MICRO-mini skirts!!)-zoe!
1,........................................................,This outfit must be the most horrid outfit I have ever saw in my life.
1,MINI SKIRT!,"I can't believe that some My Scene people say that Bratz wear mini skirts and tight shirts. I mean, Look at THIS title of this toy:My Scene Goes Hollywood On-Screen Fashions: Polo Shirt & Mini SkirtI mean, It says MINI SKIRT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why are Bratz Haters and My Scene Lovers saying that Bratz wear too much reaveling clothes and they wear mini skirts. My Scene Lovers, I'm sorry to tell you this but, MY SCENE AND BRATZ WEAR the SAME TYPES OF CLOTHES!!!!!!!!"
4,At least its a start,"Finally a book that tries to educate American cooks about the fabulous art of french garde manger cooking. Alas, it is best used by those who have advanced cooking skills as it presents ideas, more than formal instruction. Many of these dishes are difficult, and there are no directions, illustrations or tips on how to give these dishes the finished look they deserve"
4,Lively Work--Desrves Wide Audience,Paradis is a careful craftsman of free verse...Phil Paradis's work is lively and it rings true. It deserves a wide audience.--Ann Struthers
4,Poems of Intelligent Feeling,"Every word names one portion of an involvement of intelligent feeling, of empathetic contemplations, of a man who has decided to engage himself with place and with timeliness. This is poetry decisively honorable and generous, a poetry cognizant of the virtual morality of the marketplace and yet dismissive of that virtual morality. This is a poetry fraught with integrity, and we become almost blessed by reading and by assimilating it.---David Castleman"
2,NOT FOR LONGTERM,"We bought the JVC GR-DVL505U Digital Camcorder a couple of years ago. The first year was great. It did what it's supposed to do. That's why I still give it some stars.But on the second year, it started flashing a lot of error messages, constantly ask to clean head, and sometimes DID NOT record at all without any indication on the screen. We found out later when we tried to view the tapes. At first, we thought it was just a bad tape, but it happened to every single tape. In one of the tapes, we found more than half blank/skipped sections. It's so sad and frustrating because we're trying to record our baby's 'first everything'.We're planning to get a new one. We can no longer depend on this camcorder to capture the important moments. I guess 2 stars is too generous because I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
4,great camcorder,"camcorder is definitely up there with the best. but why pay $ for it used, when you can get it new on hsn for about the same price."
4,grdvl505u rating,"Looks like the best buy for the money. Has a nice display screen, resolution is more than adequate, all the features are there, and the price is right."
3,Software will not work under Windows 2000 Pro,"Camera seemed to be pretty good, but the included software will NOT run under Windows 2000. So if you think you are going to get your images on to your pc, think again. Otherwise I would have rated 4 or 5 stars.The following is from an email JVC sent to me:""Dear valued customer,This is in response to the e-mail you sent to our Technical Support team here at JVC Canada Inc.At this time there are no drivers available to make these software programs compatible with Windows NT or Windows 2000.Thank you for choosing JVC products.Sincerely, JVC Canada Inc, Technical Support Team"""
3,Software Problem,The Provided software to download digital still photos does not work in Windows 98 SE also. The Picture Navagator crashes on clicking any menu in it.
2,not really for children,"I bought this DVD given the description and title that these would be simple slokas for children. However, the tape is definitely not for young children. The slokas on this DVD are VERY long and VERY complicated. Young children will easily become bored watching the video, as the visuals are often still pictures which stay on screen for many long minutes at a time. English translation is not provided. This DVD would suit adults and teens who already have a very solid training in Sanskrit recitations. Even adults who are novices to reciting slokas will have difficulty following these recitations. I was disappointed in the purchase, because I'd hoped this DVD would help me to teach my daughter to recite some simple slokas."
5,Why is this fantastic book out of print???,Children's books can be painful and pointless as many parents will attest. This is a lovely tale that can actually help parents out by getting their child to relax and sleep while still benefitting the child with a good tale. Every parent should own one
5,This album hangs with the best of 'em,"I've been a fan of thrash-metal since'86, I've heard some killer albums in my time. This album hangs with the best of 'em out there, no doubt!! There's not one disappointing song on this album. I highly recommend purchasing this CLASSIC album, I give you my word, you won't be disappointed."
4,laying it on thick,well...the first song i ever heard from Exhorder was Desecrator.....which was found on a compilation cd titled At Deaths Door...anywho...i was blown away and of course had to buy the disc...i was pleased witht he overall sound aside from the overendulged speed display mingled with blatent obscenity (i.e.) AnalLust...but true to form...they have a unique sound that unfortunately has been mimicked by such bands like Pantera....I mean...when i was listening to this ...Pantera was still rounding up cattle and canary calling their way through the metal scene...but regaurdless...it is nice to see where the ball got rolling...check it out if you haven't done so already!
4,Biblical Theology done right!,"[I've] had a chance to use this book, and I must say that this new dictionary is one of the finest on the market. The format of this dictionary is unique. The first section contains several lengthy articles on subjects that affect biblical theology. The second section contains articles on each genre of literature in the Bible and articles on the individual books of the Bible. The final section of the book is the actual dictionary, which has numerous entries on various biblical themes. This one book serves as an introduction to biblical interpretation, an Old Testament and New Testament introduction, and a Bible Dictionary. And at 863 not-so-large print pages, one could hardly say that this book just gives a cursory view of Biblical Theology. This Dictionary is an excellent tool for both students and professors. ...."
3,Not what it's cracked up to be,"We got this bike for our son at 1 year, but he didn't start to ride it until he was about 15 months old, he just didn't care for it. Now he likes it, but the design with 2 wheels being in the front causes his feet to roll up underneath it when he pushes backwards.I wouldn't recommend this, as there are plenty of others out there with better designs and that are more stable."
2,Keep shopping for something else.,"This ride on toy was given as a gift for my son's first birthday. My son would rather push this toy around than to sit on it and take it for a ride. He'd enjoy it if I were pushing him around but I'd have to teach him to keep his feet up or it'll hit the wheels. After minutes of pushing and my backaches, the fun is done and he just wanders off and looks for something else to play with. Also, this toy is very lightweight so when he tries to get on or off this bike without assistance,it'll tip or slide, making him lose his balance and fall. There are other toys out there that would be more exciting and less painful."
4,My Son Loved this,"My son was about 2 when we bought this for him. Reasonably priced. I did have a little trouble putting it together, there are two pieces that should not be put together in a certain order, but mine was missing the label for that. I did have to return it to the store, and replace it. But, with the proper directions, putting it together was a snap. My son liked this alot. The only reason i will not pass this down to my daughter, 7 months old, when she is ready, is because he scribbled all over it. Other than that, it was very sturdy."
2,Very disappointed in this toy,I bought this toy for my 18 month old son as he is quite small. The back wheels do not turn properly outside and they are very quickly wearing out as they are plastic. He is very frustrated with not being able to go anywhere when he rides it. Perhaps it is best used indoors as some of the other reviews suggest.
2,Little Tipsy,"While my son was little (10 months) it was fine. As he grew, it began to tip and send him over the handles. I recommend very close adult supervision."
2,unstable,"My child received the toy as a birthday gift. When she was 14 months old she tried it and had difficulty pushing it so she would stand up and fall straight forward. So I decided to put it away for 2 months. Now that she is 16 months she tried it again, but now her feet get stuck under the trike, and when she try's to get them out or push she falls forward again,and my child isn't tall so it is not the height or weight. Personally of all the good fisher price toys I have bought this one is going in the trash. I will not let my child try it again."
2,Fisher Price Ride ON,"I do like this toy, however it's already splitting behind the seat on the red part where the seams meet. My daughter rides it around the house and has a lot of fun but I'm not sure how long it will last with the split in the back. I probably wouldn't buy this again because of that."
3,One of the BEST ride on toys!,"My son got this toy on his first birthday and has really enjoyed it. Of all the ride on toys he received this one is the easiest to get on and off and to ""drive"" around the house. It has more stability than others like it. Easy assembly also!"
5,Great Toy,"We purchased this toy for our son when he was aged 17 months. The seat is low to the ground and my son is very tall for his age so we were concerned that he would be TOO tall....His height has never been an issue and at 36 in. tall, he rides the toy everyday.Whomever came up with the design of this riding toy is a genius. With the narrow rear end of this rider, there's no need for little ones to maintain their balance as they kick their leg over the seat. Simply hop upon the rider from behind. My son owns two other riding toys and the fisher price is easily the most stable one.Clearly, toddlers are unstable on their feet for a long while and no riding toy is completely spill proof. Should you purchase the toy and and the toodler be too unstable, set it aside for a month or so and try it again later. For the money, this rider toy simply can't be beat."
1,Not too thrilled...,"My son and I were both unhappy with this ride-on toy. My son is 17 months old and is 34 inches tall - his legs were just too long for this toy. Not to mention that when he tried to scoot along on it, his foot kept getting caught in the rear wheel (also I noticed that the wheels don't roll well at all). Overall, it was a bummer! If you have a much smaller child, I think this would work well, but if your child is a bit larger, I would not recommend it!"
2,not a thrill,"My Mom bought our son this for Christmas when he was 1 1/2. He wasn't at all interested in it.(He got two other ride-ons for Christmas that year.) It sat around the house for almost a year before he even noticed it and then he only used it to climb on the counters and get into the cupboards for chips and cookies! Then when he decided to try to ride it, the wheels would stick and he ended up just scooting across the floor-no fun at all.We also noticed that it had a tendency to cause him to fall forward over the handle bars. The seat was too far from the handles and also had a large square ""bump"" sticking up in the front. We finally gave it away to charity- looking brand new."
3,not to steady,"My child does enjoy riding this toy, but it is very easy for children to tip over the front of it. I do allow my child to ride it as long as she is being watched carefully."
3,Not a good design,"My 20 month old gets her feet stuck in the wheels so she only plays on it a few minutes and gets frustrated. I know the design is made to promote stability, but it makes it difficult for children with long legs."
2,"UNSTEADY, Tips Forward","My child loves to sit on this toy and push it, but she has gone forward over the handlebars a number of times when she actually tries to ride it forward (she was 12 mos. when we got it, and is now 18 mos.). It is NOT as steady as the name. I would NOT let a child ride this alone EVER, even in the house.edited 12.08....now that I have 3 children, I can see that this is a sturdy outside toy. My other 2 children have not had problems with tipping or moving it forward, like my first child did. As an outside toy, it is very durable, and even though my current baby likes to stand on the seat, he has not gotten hurt on this, even if he falls in the grass. It has lasted better than some other toys we have had. It is safer as an outside toy, because there are too many sharp corners on furniture to fall on...."
2,Not so good for a one year old...,"We bought this toy last year for our daughter's first birthday. Although it is pretty stable, she couldn't really push herself around. When she did start moving around she was pushing backwards (something that most children do first) and so she would run over her feet with those two wheels in the front. She is now two and a half - she can use it now, but rarely plays with it. She is ready for a ""real"" tricycle, and has little use for this one. I would say to skip this toy."
3,The wheels fell off,The wheels on the Ride On fell off while my son was riding...We had the Ride On for 4 months and never had any problems with it until one day the wheels fell off and he fell over and hit his mouth on the cement...luckly no broken teeth. Be cautious though..the wheels are not held on by any screws or bolts...
2,Not very easy for larger children,"My 18 month old daughter had a great deal of trouble riding this toy as well. She can get on and off of it easily, but gets frustrated after only a couple of minutes. Her feet are constantly getting caught in the rear wheels and the wheels don't move well enough for her. It is pretty durable and easy to assemble, though, and it would probablly be excellent for younger, smaller children."
3,Too tall for my 14-month-old!,"I was excited to find this toy because it's one of the few that doesn't make horrible noises. Unfortunately, my baby, who is average height and weight for her age (14 months), cannot ride it because her feet don't reach the floor. So, for all you parents with short-legged babies, this is not for you!"
3,"a lovely toy, too small for our tall toddler","My daughter received this rider for Christmas when she was 15 mos old. It was a breeze to put it together -- the easiest thing ever! -- but she didn't really show any interest in it till she was about 18 mos old. However she's always been very tall for her age (2 years old now and just over 3 feet tall) and the seat is just too low to the ground for her to really enjoy it. She does love pushing it around but it hasn't really provided the riding pleasure (or exercise) I had hoped for. A very well made, colorful, easy-to-get-on bike, just not good for us... I see other posters haven't had that problem but perhaps it depends on the child. In fact I am online now shopping for a regular tricycle..."
2,Boring for competent walkers/climbers,"My son got this last Christmas when he was 18 mos old, and he has never gotten very interested in it. It is very stable and safe, and therefore very easy to mount and dismount--no challenge or learning opportunity. My son is really tall for his age, so the toy seemed kind of small for him right off the bat. I think he would have gotten more enjoyment from it when he was just starting to take steps and climb up onto things. It seems much better suited for younger, smaller kids."
1,VXML,"I was happy at first when reading this book with the anticipation of performing the final project. That project involved Java Script and JSP. Well, I was totally disappointed when I tried download the code I needed to run the project in my NetBeans environment. There was no code to download for the final project and the code in the book is incomplete. This book had some good examples for a junior VXML programmer but it did not offer anything that could not be found on the web like(Voxeo, or TellMe Studio). This book is a waste of your money. I wished I could get a refund."
4,On the Edge,I thought this book was adventurous. I enjoyed reading it because I would always be trying to guess what was going to go on in the next sentence. A woman was finding love in a boy that she kidnapped. She wanted to find love in a child that she did not have. There is a bond between the woman and the boy. In the end the boy has to make a very important decision in his life. Love or reality? Readers in the area between 12-15 would enjoy this book. Try it out.
4,Surprise!,"I bought this CD for 1.00 at a closeout sale..and I have to say I got a a great surprise in the song ""Star Tramps"" I love that song! I have to say thought that the CD artwork and cover need to be redone...it is not representitive of the great music. The whole CD is not a hit but I love it when I am surprised at the music and lyrics and China Forbes did that for me. Bravo!"
2,No longevity,"I have been using these for over 2 years now. We have 19 water spigots across our property. They range in use from my wife's vegetable garden, occasional hookup for a power washer, and horse troughs. You could say we test these cross the whole gamut.If you let them freeze they crack.Frequent use wears out rubber seals (I get maybe a year of disconnecting and reconnecting an item once a week).The crack easily, usually leaving a male piece in the female piece, which is impossible to get out and requires changing both pieces.I've yet to find anything that works better, and at this price I can afford to replace them all every year."
1,Gilmour quick connects fail,"Initially I bought one set each of a few brands to compare. Gilmour seemed to be made the best, it has a built in valve (very handy), and the male connector has a wide flange which makes it easy to tighten with fingers (others need a wrench if you don't have tough hands). So I bought four sets of Gilmour, I was very happy for the first two months, but now they have all failed. Can't push the male connector all the way into the female. Seems to be a problem inside the female. I'm starting over, looking at other brands."
4,Classic Elegant Bossa Nova,"This is a very nicely produced CD with some Brazilian standards and five unique bossa nova arrangements, Manha De Carvaval, Tristeza, Wave, Avarandado, and Sabia. The sound is unique is that the piano style is highly infuenced with a classical piano flavor. I'm very glad I bought this one."
5,A successful cross-over,"Reviewer Pablo Rossi (above) writes in his (untranslated) Spanish that a Brazilian street musician plays better, more authentically than Barenboim; that Barenboim doesn't feel the true ""Brazilian Soul"". Unfortunately, Mr. Ross doesn't tell us when and where he has had the privilege of being in touch with that particular object, but I suspect a quick week-end in Rio. Well, I'm from Brazil and I can tell you that Barenboim plays these songs marvelously well, with great feeling for the genre and, of course, immense talent. Highly recommended."
3,no alcanza con virtuosismo...,"este cd de barenboim muestra una vez mas un viejo problema al pretender trasladar y adaptar la musica de ciertos generos, la brasilera es una de las mas castigadas, esta experiencia adolece de los mismos defectos de los tenores cantando tango, rancheras,etc. nadie puede negar la maestria pianistica de barenboim, pero el alma de la musica brasilera esta mas presente en un interprete callejero de rio de janeiro que aqui. si gusta de la musica del brasil aqui solo encontrara su fantasma"
4,A legitimate romance,"I was really impressed with this book. I purchased it because I kept seeing it every where. Have to say, it was worth it. It was rough, but I could really see the potential of this author. The story was great and she had me really caring for her main character Mel. I absolutely love romances and this is one of the better ones that I've read."
5,kebob/kabob bamboo skewers,These are the perfect length for a chocolate fountain. I also used these to make an appetizer. The skewers were jiust sturdy enough.
4,Catcher's Gear,Ordered Catcher's Gear from Amazon and had it sent to my daughter in another state. It was fast and easy. The item was for my grandson's and they received it ahead of schedule and were very happy.
3,Components Appear Sturdy But...,"Esportsonline shipped quickly, courteous customer service. Catcher's gear youth fit an 11-year-old girl, approximately 5' tall, very well, but helmet was far too small, even allowing for some eventual compression of the foam padding. One-piece construction of helmet shell may account for the tight fit. Hope to exchange for adult helmet. Otherwise, a decent price for rec ball gear."
4,Works,This product works as advertised. Seems to be of good quality and can't really go wrong with the value for the price.
1,Final Track Mediocre,"I bought the end of final track of this album because I want to use the end in my wedding. Unfortunately, the great reviews helped me waste my money. Beware that better recordings are out there."
3,Cokin P-Series Graduated ND Grey G2 Full (ND8) (0.9) Filter,"These are not the best filters optically, but I understood that and decided to save some $'s compared to better, but more expensive filters. They are exactly as advertised and reviewed all over the web. Good value for the money; probably not going to be used by professional photographers."
4,good little towel bar - just what I needed!,"No stores are selling undersink, cabinet-mount towel bars anymore! I must have looked at every home store, hardware store, drugstore, and big-box store out there, with no luck. Then I decided to look at Amazon, and found these. They are just what I needed, something to hide and dry my kitchen towels. I ended up ordering three so I could use one in the laundry room and my son's bathroom, but one out of the three had some wire that was exposed and was defective, otherwise I would have given 5 stars. The company said they would reimburse me for all three because I cut my finger on the defective one. I need to check my credit card statement still, but I thought that was more than fair. ** Bonus: they are super easy to install and are quite sturdy! **Not a bonus: the shipping charge if I had ordered just one, cost more than the towel bar! I was not charged more when I ordered 3, however."
4,"Strong writing, disappointing conclusion","Mr. Nicastro is an excellent writer, one of the best I've read in the genre of historical fiction. However, without giving away the story, I must admit I found the resolution and conclusion to be disappointing and weak, especially after such a strong start.The book is good at depicting the culture of Sparta. The characters are interesting and have some depth. The battle sequences are also quite good. However, if one invests time in reading a story, the ending is also important, and the ending in this book disappointed me.Suffice it to say that the most deserving characters get no love from their creator, while the least sympathetic come out big winners. Why? I've thought about it, and I can't find a good reason."
2,Disappointing,"Overall, this book is a disappointment. The story drags, the characters are flat, and the writing is average. I didn't feel that any of the characters were well-developed. There seemed to be gaps, as if the original manuscript was much longer but his editor made him cut out large sections.The comparisons of Nicastro to Pressfield are misleading; TIoS falls very far short of Pressfield's work. Personally, I found the story boring and quit after about 2/3 of the way through.On the plus-side (arguably): I will acknowledge that TIoS does not romanticize the Spartans; it is less ""glorious"" and more ""nitty-gritty."" (Personally, I'm not sure this is necessarily a good thing. The result is a pretty dry novel).Not recommended."
2,Yawn,It's very very very rare that I don't finish a book. I did not finish this book. The story drags on and on and on. This is truly a bore and one to pass up. There's other books out there that deal with ancient Sparta that are much better reads.
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I'm not usually a fan of this kind of book, but I picked it up because of my husband's recommendation. I'm glad I did. Where other writers in this genre seem happy to glorify the violence of the time, Nicastro seems more interested in understanding it, and transmitting that understanding to his readers. Not that there isn't plenty of fighting in the book...there's plenty. But I also appreciated knowing more about the culture and the psychology of the men holding the spears, and the women who put the spears in their hands. I think I'll try his John Paul Jones books next."
3,"Good depiction, weak plot.","As a fan of Pressfield's novels about the Greeks, I thought I'd branch out and try another author writing on the topic. I certainly enjoyed Nicastro's candid portrayal of the Spartans and feel that he does an excellent job of giving a general depiction of Spartan attitude and lifestyle, but I didn't find the particular plot as interesting or engaging as I thought I might. The book never dragged too terribly, but it never really excited me either."
3,Dissapointing,"Fans of Steven Pressfield and Michael Curits Ford will be dissapointed in this book about the only battle in wich the famed Spartans ever surrendered. The characters are very cardboard and difficult to like. The book becomes tedium as the reader is not drawn in to care about the characters in the story very much. The story also jumps around a bit and so is very choppy. Pressfield could pull that off in his Amazon book but Nicastro cannot. The story will leap years ahead from one chapter to the next in a very nonfluid way. A more heroic way of telling this story would have served better. Instead, at the end most of the main characters are dead and the reader is left saying, ""Who Cares?"""
2,isle of something i cant describe,"uh...Im still having trouble deciding if i liked this book, but lets make it clear this book doesnt even come close to ""gates of fire"". Sure in life not everyone is happy but in this book, NO ONE is happy!!! it was difficult to really get to know the characters they are all like stone they dont come to life at all. The mother was damaged, the youngest son was spoiled and the older son neglected. Although Nicastro got the traditions and practices of the spartans correct i felt like i was reading a history book (a depressing one) instead of a good novel. maybe next time."
1,The Isle of Stone,"although a very informative history novel, it unfortunately drug on with very little plot and a very dull ending big disappointment. i read this book on suggestions after reading Sam Barone history novels , which were a wonderful read and storyline about history."
4,Quite the charmer!,"It's in my surprised opinion that this book is out of print because it was very well written in my opinion and quite romantic too! It was adventurous and taught one a lesson of how love is such an important value in your life and when everything is at an end, love will always be there to still guide you through. So this was an awesome book and I really enjoyed reading it."
3,Torn,"I am slighty torn between really loving this book and not liking it at all. The reasons I'd like it are numerous, but to be brief I enjoyed the fact that it is historically accurate, and the characters are extremely well developed. The reason I do not like this book is the one scene where I lose all respect for Neville Rossiter. I'm afraid I will never be able to reconcile love with such an act. It is an exercise of power, not love.I thank you for the opportunity to air my views."
4,Touching grace,Not very honest of me to review this really. My mother wrote several romantic novels and this was one of her most successful. I think she had a special and touching way with a story. I like to think that some of the grace she had as a person can be seen in this book. Enjoy.
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!,"I haven't heard this CD since I was 19!! I am so glad to own Big Mike!! It has several jams on here that I love like Creepin and Rollin, Having Thangs and Somethin Serious. I recommend to anyone who is a fan of the old school!!!"
1,SHARP NOT QUIET,"I have a Sharp Library Quiet A/C and it's so noisy I have to turn it off to listen to the television. I don't recommend it. If you buy cheap, you get cheap."
2,Hunting? Dall Sheep & Caribou,"While the scenery was outstanding in the Northwest territory the video lacked in several areas. It was very short, cinematography was poor, and the guides who claim to have years of experience failed to pass along any useful tips for the would-be hunter. The segment when the dall sheep was shot was horrible in that it showed a ""prize"" sheep falling off the mountain because the hunter used a rifle that lacked adequate gunpower to reach across the 400+ yards to kill the animal with one shot. Overall we were VERY disappointed."
3,A Bit Disappointed...,"Let me start by saying that this is in fact one of my favorite animes. The characters are amazing and the stories are just plain ridiculous. However, after seeing a fan sub version I must say I was fairly disappointed in this version's avoidance of all swearing whatsoever. Yes, swearing is not exactly necessary to tell a story but I have to say that in this particular case an accurate translation adds a lot to your feel for the characters. I was also disappointed in the accent they chose for Osaka. I'm sorry, but a Huston-ish accent just doesn't work. All that said, it IS a fantastic series and it IS worth picking up, just expect a somewhat Americanized experience..."
3,couldn't finish the whole series,"First off, i must agree on what some of the other people have said: it is a lot like Seinfeld (i.e. a show about nothing). While it does have some funny moments, most of the time, its straight up boring. Most of the characters are very likable but theyre all stuck in boring, ridiculous stories. Some of the other characters are just plain annoying or stupid, like the ""Osaka"" girl or Tomo. The show reminds me of ""Pani Poni Dash"" but without the humor. I honestly tried to watch it, but i could only watch about half of it before i finally got bored with it. I gave it three stars because some of the characters were worth going through all of the boring stuff to see (like the perverted teacher). If you like Seinfeld, then you will more than likely enjoy watching this, but if you're like me and don't like Seinfeld, then watch something else."
5,"Totally pointless, no plot... how could you not love it?","I got this boxed set really cheap from Best Buy, I only spent $25 on it, and it's great! All the characters are just so loveable and they have such extreme personalities. Throughout the show it's just a bunch of people running around doing random stuff, and it is just hilarious. There's so many cute random things, and the way the characters repeat stuff in annoying ways makes it so much cuter. I'd definitely give this series a thumbs up. Great for laughs, but if you're looking for serious, thought-provoking anime, don't get this, lol."
5,A series about nothing--and that's why it's great!,"Azumanga Daioh is one of the top anime series on my list. Each character is appealing in their own way (my favorite character is Osaka), and each episode kind of drifts along lazily, like a warm summer's evening or a boat on a calm lake. There really isn't much of a plot to follow along with, but that's ok, it's just fun to listen to the girls talk about nothing and chat about everything. It reminds me of my days in school talking to my friends, and that's why I think I like it so much. ...I even found myself crying while watching the last episode! When a cartoon makes you do that, you KNOW it's good!"
3,Cooking Southern Italian,"This DVD is more of a travelogue than a ""how to cook it"" presentation. The recipies are presented in a quick, generalized fashion with the moderator mispronouncing common Italian phrases. The types of dishes chosen are authentic and prepared by local chefs. The video redeems itself by visiting the colorful market places of Naples and Palermo and all the beautiful locales of southern Italy and Sicily."
3,"Good, but could be better","This was an interesting DVD and was nice to watch for the topic and information. I liked the tour through Italy and the Food of course, but the narration leaves much to be desired. She not only is anot able to pronounce the Italian words properly but her voice drones on almost to the point you don't want to watch the rest od the movie. Overall it is interesting and visualy beautiful. Get it for the food and pictures."
2,Outdated much?,"I got this soon to be forgotten dvd in hopes of inspiration. What I received was a nearly quarter century old beta-to-dvd low quality dub. The laughable gigantic ""swords"" that these chefs used to dice onions was amazing! I am relatively 100% positive that the restaurants the highlighted haven't been there for quite some time. Juniper berries? They are so retro!"
3,good starter for those new to nutritional issues,"Lots of common sense knowledge, an easy read. Some very good recipes that are easy to reproduce."
3,"Pretty good, but not great","This book is ok-- if you know anything about healthy eating, vegetarian or vegan diets, or the mistreatment of animals slaughtered for food, then you probably will not find this book very useful. However, if you don't know anything about these things and consume a high-fat diet full of animal foods, bad carbs, and rely on convenience foods full of sodium and chemicals, then this book would be a good resource to help you change to a more healthy lifestyle. But, it is not really a diet, it's more like a guidebook to what is wrong with the way you currently eat and foods to add and eliminate to help you eat and feel better."
4,Good Overview,This is a video that shows both the Brooklyn Tabernacle singers and provides a good glimpse of the story of Angola prision. I purchased the video in preparation for a visit to Angola to minister to the prisoners. It helped prepare me for that experience.
4,Sinatra singing is not in the movie,"Good soundtrack, good movie based on a Stephen King story. The Sinatra songs that played during the movie were NOT actually Frank Sinatra, they were covers,that may be why they are not included on this cd. I'm not sure who did the singing. I guess Sinatra didn't approve his versions for some reason, maybe they thought it was a horror film."
5,Breathless,"finished this book in an hour. It was heart stopping,told so clearly from a 9 year old's perspective that was uncannily erie.The book's tension gradually increased until its heart stopping ending.....and then the book continues to haunt you.I can't recommend this enough..."
3,I'm Not Scared,"This is a story of a nine year old boy, Michele, who lives in the small town of Acqua Traverse. While the grown ups are hiding from the heat indoors during a heat wave in 1978, Michele, his friends and his sister set out on their bikes looking for adventure. After stumbling across a deserted house, Michele alone, discovers a horrible secret that will force him to choose between loyalty to his parents and his own conscience. Although the story was short and the ending was sad, the writing was beautiful. I would recommend this book."
3,"A quick, creepy read","Something for the late night thriller fan. The translation is a little stilted, but it's a great little story that with a twist that will give you some serious chills."
2,No Suspension,"I'm afraid my opinion of this book is closer to reviewer ""Cmonsassy's"", as the story did not strike me as believable at any point. There are so many things about the story which would have to be explained -- and I can't really go into them without giving away too much of the book -- suffice it to say that some of the central threads of this story just didn't wash.Although engagingly written, from the very beginning I had difficulty suspending disbelief and immersing myself in the story, and the book never redeemed itself in the end. I was left with the impression that it was melodramatic, overwrought, and not particularly believable."
5,A coming of age story,"When I picked this book up I was unable to put it down...for seven hours! I literally read it overnight. While the mystery held some intrigue, I was most captivated by the overarching story of children coming of age during a scorching, corrupted summer.The growing up part of the film is very reminiscent of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and the lessons the Finch children learn as the story of the trial unfolds. I absolutely enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone looking for a captivating read."
2,Lost in The Translation ...,"I am sure this is a case of something being lost in the translation. I speak native Italian and the translation is stilted; mistranslating Italian words (i.e. He says the child is afraid of ""vipers' ... it should say ""the child is afraid of ""snakes."") The translator has no sense of idiomatic use of language, and therefore we wind up with a book that is neither Italian enough, nor English enough. If there is anything lyrical in Niccolo's writing, it is lost in this version. I was very disappointed at the ending. Left hanging high and dry. Very unsatisfying conclusion to a plodding and unbelievable story line. Sigh."
1,My Opinion Differs From the 6 Previous Reviewers,"My mother used to enjoin me, ""If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."" If I follow her advice, you won't know why I didn't enjoy the book. I bought it, so I finished reading it. If I'd gotten it from the library, I'd have returned it without completing it. It might be a discussion piece for high school English class or a book club - to analyze and discuss for effect, characterization and plot - but the characters never engaged me and I found the plot plodding. Overall ... tedious, and the people small and unsympathetic."
2,"I'm not scared, only of the hideous writing of this book!","This book encouraged me to read it with the mystery that lingered within. However, when I read it, I was very disappointed. The ending was predictable and a very boring way to end the novel. I found the book dealt with unnecessary exploiations of children's sexuality and wasn't impressed at all. In fact I found it very disturbing. The novel was too dramatic and over the top. The one good thing about the novel is that it ended."
1,waste of time,"This book is poorly written, tedious, and has a predictable ending. It was a waste of time"
4,Brava!,"What a wonderful book! Lots of rare photos, nicely presented in a large format, on glossy paper. It's very attractive. And well-written, with anecdotes about early Las Vegas, a very engaging narrative.My only quibble: since the dates are tightly defined, the writer is confined to stories involving many of the same people; it's all basically one generation. As names are introduced again in subsequent chapters, it gets a little redundant. But it's also honest journalism: some VIPs were more prominent and productive than others. The stories Ms. Whitely conveys are enormously entertaining, from the lofty Senator who brought the railroad to town, to the price of a call girl during the decades when prostitution was legal, plus plenty more.This beautiful book would make a wonderful gift."
2,White coated dogs,"This crate works OK, just have to make sure you use a snap or clasp to keep the doors locked, as vibration will wiggle the latches open. I would not buy this crate if you have white coated dogs, as the finish will rub on the dog's coat. I found this out while traveling to a dog show with my dog in the crate. When I got to the show, my dog came out looking like a zebra where she sat up against the side of the crate. I use midwest kennels, always found the fine for the shows, but I only purchase the black coated crates now."
5,Midwest triple-door Dog Crate,Very functional. Easy to set up and the 3 doors provide access points for various configurations. My 50lb Wheaten fits in it very comfortably.
4,Serviceable,"Bought this crate for our 2 60-lb German short-hairs to share, since they don't like to be apart. We have a competing brand in the house, and this was for corralling them in the shop. Not as large as I'd hoped, but the 3 doors do make positioning the crate a great choice for people with limited space or furniture configurations. I recommend putting a blanket down inside because the plastic tray in the bottom doesn't fit well and is a very low quality plastic. Teething pups will have a go at it otherwise."
1,Horrible product,"I'm glad that the others who bought this enjoyed it, but my experience was horrible. I am buying a different brand because the first one shipped to my house with rust all over the bars and the box was ripped open on one side. The doors were clunky and hard to open. I ordered a replacement and this one was sealed perfectly, bars still rusted and doors clunky, hard to latch. I don't want my puppies licking rust, plus it doesn't look nice on the mostly silver bars. The hinge for one of the doors is broken on the new one also, so now I am just getting a refund and buying a Midwest / iCrate."
3,XL crate at affordable rate with divider,This is a nice crate for the money. It includes the divider and gives you 3 doors which allows you to position the crate almost anywhere you want.Easy to assemble and break down for transport. Its a bit heavy but that is to be expected with this size crate.The crate came with a few wires bent but a pair of pliers fixed that issue.It almost seems the included divider is just a tad small and could be a bit wider to make placement easier. With the divider in place the sides of the kennel bow/bend inward slightly since the fit is so tight. I tried adjusting the kennel to get a better fit with out any luck.Overall a good crate but they could do better with the divider fit.
5,Great crate,"This ia a well made heavy duty crate, It is easy to put up and take down. It is heavy but good quality."
4,Dog Crate,"This crate is terrific with the 3 different access doors. It is bigger than I thought it would be, but for our Golden it works fine. Takes up as much space as our computer desk. I'm giving it 4 stars, our Golden gives it 5 stars because now he can do his long stretches."
3,Poor/irresponsible shipping packaging,"The crate itself is okay, though it can be made a tad stronger to fit large breeds judging the size of the crate. The charcoal color is nice. What was the most disappointing, rather upsetting, was the way the crate had been shipped! The shipper plainly stuck shipping label on the original box (as if you are picking it up at a local pet store) with NO PROPER CUSHIONING or SHIPPING PACKAGING - the package came in its box half open, exposing the product. As a result, any one can imagine how the crate appeared as it was assembled -- apparent scratches and whopping here and there! What was even worse was I emailed Amazon thereafter to express my frustration which led to an as-if-helpful response saying I might feel free to return it. Shipping the gigantic item back would probably cost more than the crate itself, I had no choice but to keep it.All in all, irresponsible shipping packaging and disappointing Amazon customer service."
3,"Good, but not her best.",I have been a fan since her first album. This album lacks the emotion of her earlier work. For die hard fans only.
2,Kind-of boring,"The songs are mostly ballads. They sound very similar to one another. I had a hard time listening to the album in its entirety.Buy her self-titled album or ""Crossroads"" or ""Telling Stories"" instead."
5,Tracy is the bomb (and that means GOOD),"Tracy and I went to school together, and I told her then to keep on singing. I'm very proud. buy this CD and you won't be sorry! and then buy all her other CDs. she is the modern Billy Holiday or Nina Simone - way way better than Natalie Cole. she is better than most anyone I can think of, in fact - yup, she's my favorite."
1,Wouldn't play on IPOD,"This CD loaded on computer fine, but when then loaded on IPOD, it was completely fuzzy. Other CD I ordered worked fine."
1,Use it for a coaster,"I am a huge Tracy Chapman fan. Her self-titled CD & New Beginnings are 2 of my favorite CDs in my collection. I put this CD in and couldn't find a song I liked. I tried and tried to like the CD but I couldn't. Obviously, by the other reviews other people feel differently but this CD just didn't cut it for me. My advice... pick up any of her other CDs."
3,Solid but predictable,"As is quickly becoming a trend for Tracy Chapman, with Let It Rain she has put out another predictable (and at times boring) album of solid material. She continues to write powerful, introspective lyrics...but the music surrounding those lyrics doesn't really mark any new vigor or new direction for Tracy Chapman. The music sounds like it would be perfectly at home on Telling Stories or New Beginning....both of which are good albums...but one would hope for something a little fresher this time around. While I'm certainly still a fan of Tracy Chapman, I would be hard-pressed to recommend this one. Newcomers should start with her incredible self-titled debut before this one. Alas, this one's only for the die-hards."
5,Sadness...,"I can hardly tell you how wonderful of a find ""Let It Rain"" is. There is a lot of pain here, from 'Almost' and its sad resignation or doubt found in 'Happy'. On the few happy side of it - you'll find 'I'm Yours' and 'Your The One'. While most of it deals with poor relationships situations, its an amazing emotional pull through it. Almost a start to end order interestingly enough - but ending with a happy ending ;)"
4,Quietly introspective,"Probably not as good as her self-titled debut, Let It Rain is again quietly introspective with a blues feel and full of easygoing songs. The title track talks about going with the flow of everything the rain brings. Almost talks of dreams almost attained and she carries her disillusionment to Broken almost as if she is praying. Very beautiful and quiet."
4,Very Handy,"I bought these with my Derwent Inktense Pencils. The pencils need water to turn permanent into ink. I color with the pencils, and then apply the water. The waterbrush is almost like using a pencil. I can control where I want the water to go. This is very important in keeping the water in one area. You can buy different size waterbrushes if you want a bigger or smaller tip."
1,Not very good,"If this is the only water brush you can get, then it is better than no water brush at all. It is hard to squeeze the barrel and the tips of the brush wear out very quickly. The Pentel is superior in every way."
3,leaks a lot,"maybe I received a bum one -- but as I work, the pen leaks from the sides where it screws together. I imagine this would be a great item to have but I can only use it as a regular brush - unfilled - in order to avoid spills."
1,Niji Waterbrush - hate it!,"I bought one of each of these and am very sorry I did. Once I fill them and screw the cap back on - I CANNOT get it back off! No matter what I do! Even with pliers. And I do not have a lot of strength in my hands to screw things on tight so I think it must be the product I liked the brushes while I used them but if I can only use them once, what is the point? I would not buy this brand again."
4,It's definitely a different tool than a normal brush,"I bought this intending to use it on-the-go, and it works like a charm.There isn't that much water that stores on the inside, so I have to refill it a lot. The brush part is not exactly ideal for water-colour painting, and it doesn't hold much water, but I guess that's what the water on the inside of the brush is for, right?It's not at all the same as a normal water colour brush, so it took a lot of getting used to, but I think it works just great.tl;drgreat brush for on-the-go, not the same as a normal brush, refills will kill you if you're painting a large picture."
5,This is what good music sounds like.,"The first 13 tracks are the best (of course) but they all have something to recommend them. Clooney and Crosby not only blend voices seamlessly, but the fun they must have had recording this shines through. They're having a blast and it shows. They don't sing 'em like this anymore, and that's a pity. At least they captured these performances and we can listen to them again and again. Best of all, they only improve with listening."
3,Too filled with novelty songs,"I was a bit disappointed in this recording. While Bing and Rosemary are obviously having a great time, many of the songs are second rate. Comic numbers like ""Hindustan"" and ""You've Come a Long Way from St.Louis"" are fun in small numbers, but they make up the bulk of this CD. The few quality numbers they do, such as ""I Can't Get Started"" and ""How About You"" really stand out. I wish there had more like these."
1,No Bounce,I ordered these for a family tennis tournament and every can we opened was dead. I was very disappointed in the product.
1,Penn Tennis Balls,My game wasn't that bad! the tennis balls were flat.The balls only lasted two sets.I will look elsewhere for another brand of balls that lasta bit longer.
1,"Cute cover, dumb book","Cute cover, dumb book. Can the world possibly need another sex manual that talks down to people ? Written to make a buck, it's just another waste of good trees."
1,Sex for the clueless,"Here we go again. The ""Baby-Boom"" generation thinks it invented sex. I see Marcy Sheiner feels the same way. She might hate marriage and support adultery, but I love marriage and I like being faithful to my husband. This book spews venom against spirituality and family values. I beleive, contrary to popular belief, that you can be a conservative and have a great sex life. Do not buy this book; go home and kiss your spouse.-From generation X-er."
4,A complete review on P&I insurance.,"This book deals with all the aspects of protection and indemnity rules. In particular, the author examined each cover, providing interesting cases with comments on every one of them. Issues like membership contract, entries, Club management, premiums, additional calls, are well documented, which are hard to find with such details in other P & I books. Concerning Club's letters of security and undertaking, the author manages himself to explain to both students and insurance experts. FD&D and War risks are also explained with detail, so this excellent piece of literature can be consider out of ordinary."
1,beware of your purchases from reputable sellers...,"I purchased this book eagerly looking forward to new ideas with mosaics....unfortunately, inside the book several pages had been torn out and missing. Three different sections of the book had a minimum of 6 pages torn out! I was disappointed to discover that even though I may have purchased from a reputable seller, they evidently do not take the time to look inside books for damage before they sell them. At least they accommodated me, but that couldn't change the fact that some of the main projects I'd hoped to create had been the ones removed from the book. :( I ended up giving it to charity."
4,It's on point! Good CD worth listen to!,"This album is off the chain! Representing that South Park Texas to the fullest! Ganksta Nip's album is hard to get! Most of underground rap artist is hard to find! You can only get it on amazon. Rap-A-Lot records are the best thing out of Texas! Geto Boys and Scarface are the best rappers in Houston before Ganksta Nip, U.G.K., Big Mello(RIP), and Slim Thug. I keep on supporting underground records. Thanks Amazon for this album!Dee SmallsRepresent Decatur GA"
2,wack album,"nip's first album loved it psychotic, evil, drug related and satanic all at once this album except for 2 songs sucked ity was wack see why I never copped it back in 93 this was the worst nip album."
1,time is money,i will be glad to rate this cd as soon as it finds the way to Biloxi MS. P.S real reec
5,Continued greatness,This is the most recent release from Days of the New and hopefully not the last. This whole album rocks from start to end. Travis Meeks has taken acoustic guitar hard rock to a new level. I would have normally never tried anything labelled acoustic guitar hard rock (mainly because of the acoustic guitar part) but I'm so glad I did. This album needs to be experienced as trying to describe it is almost impossible.Supposedly their 4th album (dubbed purple) is in the process of being made but it's slow going since their record label was bought out by another label who made the stupid decision to not keep Days of the New's contract. Hopefully it will surface soon.
5,Explicit lyrics?,"Could someone explain why this has the explicit lyrics tag? I would like to know if this is particularly offensive prior to purchase, or if there are certain tracks which may be offensive."
3,Overall a step back,"When I bought this cd I was expecting a continuation on the second cd. The idea of contecting all the songs into one another to create a cd that isn't remember for individual tracks, but instead of as one great work was increatable. This cd on the other hand just seems to go back to the basic design used in the first album. The explaination that best illustrated what this cd felt like to me was that it seems like travis was writing all these songs, but he couldn't connect them together, so instead of waiting for insiration to strike he just recorded them all and smacked them together."
5,Everything that was promised....,"...was delivered in the third album made by the band Days of the New. Travis Meeks has masterfully composed and written twelve great tracks for this CD. Featuring newer material and songs that were written a few years back, this CD is a great final chapter to a trilogy of fantastic music. From the first track to the last, you wont want to turn it off. The music grabs you and takes you on an emotion ride. Your heart will pump wildly to such songs as ""Words"" and ""Fighting with Clay"", and your soul will soar above the earth listing to ""Die Born"" and ""Dancing in the Wind"". This is one album Days of the New fans cant miss, and new fans will want to start with."
4,The space between...,"The first Days of the New album was mediocre...the second was a masterpiece. This one is a blending of the two. Although it is a sizable step back from Days of the New II, it isn't bad...in fact it's a highly enjoyable album. Songs such as ""Die Born"" and ""Hang On To This"" are meant to grab the passive listener while jewels such as the final track are meant for the more progressive Days of the New fan.Personally I didn't think Travis could top the Green album, but I kept an open mind. I have to be honest and say I was disappointed because I was expecting him to outdo his last album. I now fear that it is impossible. Still, check this album out...it's musically solid."
3,good but thats it,"first of all this is nowhere near travis meeks' best work. yeah the first song ""hang on to this is a good catchy tune, but other than a couple more songs this album is kinda bland. its a faster pace than the other dotn albums(the slower depressing songs made the other albums). what you can see is travis meeks going in different directions. what it lacks in good tunes it makes up for in originality. the egyptian rythm of ""giving in"" to the jazz orcestra feel of dancing in the wind. if you like dotn i would buy this album , but if you dont know who they are get the first 2 albums first."
2,complete disappointment. BUY IT ANYWAY!,"This is an album which was obviously written by Travis Meeks under pressure from his major label executives to create songs that will rebound days of the new into full-on modern rock glory once again. If you were looking for a truly artistic album by extraordinarily creative person, buy the green album. if you ever want Days of the New to release another green album, buy TWO of the red album.i wont force you to listen to it.i really loved the green album, guys."
3,Talk about a disapointment,"I'll keep this short. I personally detested Days' first CD. However, I think their second was the best record of the late 90's. This one seems to fall in between those two. It's definitley more of a rock album than the second. It lacks that other worldy mystical quality that the DOTN II had. So, it's not quite as big a Alice in Chains rip-off as their first CD, but Travis Meeks artistic vision went from a dark, symphonic magical epic, to just another rock band."
3,Soundgarden is back and better than ever!,"Travis Meeks and Company have finally delivered the long-awaited (okay, two years isn't that long of a wait) follow-up to the excellent ""Green Album,"" this time sounding more like Chris Cornell than Jim Morrison. Although not as innovative as the band's second CD, this is a worthy addition for those of us who didn't get completely burned out on Grunge before its sad demise. The only bad thing I have to say about DOTN #3 is that it comes in an unattractive red jewelbox that hides the artwork. But that is a minor imperfection that is easily remedied by replacing the red jewelbox with the traditional clear case (duh). BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE: take the empty red case, melt it down and smoke it while listening to self-titled CD #3--it's fun!"
1,Lame Ghost Story,"This movie is basically a woman jumping up and down on a bed, pretending to be raped by a ghost. This movie is so cheesy, it should come with pepperonis on top. No boobies. No good acting. No good special effects. This movie is like a turd, it just sat there and stunk."
5,Worked great.,The Heath Zenith 121AC was the perfect replacement for a failed unit in an old house we're renovating. Easy to install and worked as expected.
4,Wired Door Chime Transformer,"The unit worked just fine .........absolutely no complaints. Thanks for making the unit available on line. Yes, I would recommend the same."
1,Not Necessarily 16 Volts,"The copy I received puts out a bit over 19 volts with a 120 volt input. While this is probably good for a lot of conventional solenoid driven door chime systems, electronic based ones like theGE onemay not be able to handle that high a voltage (even after it drops a bit in long wiring runs).Since it's so easy to get this right (it's just the number of wiring turns in the transformer) I can't rate it higher than 1 star."
1,Tasteful Sales Rank,"Another misguided and obnoxious effort from Datlow at ""transcending the genre"" if you dislike the genre so much go try and manipulate public taste at the Missouri review, Tikun or similar tennis court & lifestyle emporium. The result here is nothing so much as a Harlequin romance bodice & cod-piece sampler."
3,half of this record is great,The other half is them trying to come up with Don't Fear the Reaper and not really succeeding. Still a great record and one you need to own. Disease is one of their all time greatests!Also check out Mighty High...In Drug City.
2,Below-average release from one of America's best bands (2.5 stars),"The Dictators are incredible. Few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n' roll ideals as these guys have, and their Spinal-Tap-meets-Ramones-mees-Beach-Boys style almost always works - almost. ""Manifest Destiny"" is a dissapointing release from the 'Tators. I mean its not a bad album, but the guys can do much better than this. There are a few good songs. ""Disease"" is hilarious, particulary the spoken word act from Handsome Dick at the begining. ""Science Gone Too Far"" is one of the band's catchiest tunes, proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s. Their closing cover of the Stooges' ""Search & Destroy"" is an okay interperatation of the classic. However, that's about it. The rest are mostly humorless FM-style rockers, and while the Dictators weren't selling out, they were certainly trying to become more accesible. Download those three tunes, and pick up every other album by the band."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I tried the Seacret nail care line at a mall and their buffer was amazing. I never had seen my nail so shiny and smooth, but I didn't want to pay the $40 for it, and I just wanted the buffer. So I got the Lil Whistler, and it's a pale comparison for the Seacret one. The Seacret completely buffed out all of my nail ridges and shined it to an amazingly bright shine. This one buffed some ridges, but didn't remove them, and the shine matches my Seacret nail, 2 weeks later. I would recommend paying the extra money... it really does make a difference."
3,Okay but there are better options,"This nail buffer worked okay, but in my experience it's nothing like the buffers from the mall kiosks. The shine lasts better than the really cheap versions, but not as long as the kiosk version which is what I wanted.The biggest problem with this product for me was longevity - it's almost completely useless after 6 months. I used it once a week, and it does not make my nails shine after 6 months. In a similar price point, I have had much better experience with this:2xswisa Beauty Sensation Dead Sea Magic Nail Buffer"
1,Fellowes Won't Support This Product When it Breaks,"This product works fine most of the time. Unfortunately, the people in my office were not aware that a cleaning sheet must be run through after each laminator sheet is run through. If this isn't done the rollers can get sticky, grab the next sheet and wrap it around the roller. When this happened in my office, I called Fellowes customer service line. I was told that there is no way to service this model. Unless it's under warrenty one can't even mail it to the company for repairs. They also have no authorized repair centers. I was told that it was, ""Time to get a new one."""
2,Beautiful but not as described,"I wanted a watch that was dressy as well as water resistant. The description of this watch is that is is water resistant up to 99 feet. This is not true. I went down a water slide and the watch had water in it. Also, being a chronograph watch, the bottom button is suppose to reset the second hand to 12. It only reset to 9. All in all while being a beautiful watch, it was not at all water resistant. I returned the watch without a problem although I had to pay the return shipping on a watch that was defective and i was not offered a replacement - only a refund. I felt that due to the fact that the second hand did not function properly, I should not be responsible for the return shipping cost. I have now ordered a Bulova Marine Star watch which is sure to be water resistant, so I understand."
5,Brian Tracy is fantastic and very enlightening!,I originally viewed this tape after renting it from our library from our company. I continue to review this movie almost monthly. Brian Tracy is outstanding in his pereformance in bring the customer and the sales peron together to get the sales closed. He gave me some great new ideas that I use every day and find that his ideas work very well. I would strongly recommend this video to anyone in the sales industry who want to increase there sales potential and motivate themselves to all new levels...Great Job!!!
2,"Out of date, even when it was new.","Brian Tracy has some very useful knowledge to pass on about the psychology of selling. He has taught lots of people, lots of things. Unfortunately his outrageously corny sales verbiage was cheesy back when this material was new, now it would get you laughed at...after the prospect threw you out. This is interesting from a historical perspective but if you're learning to sell; find authors who know about selling your type of product, and read the reviews of newer material."
5,It does the job and makes my life easier.,I love this thing. I've washed two dogs twice. I don't feel like washing the dogs is a miserable chore anymore. It's fast and gets them really clean. I washed my 150 lb filthy squirming dog today. It took 10 min. Yes it's plastic like a kid toy. Don't treat it like a fire hose and you will be happy.
1,Returning this today!,"I bought one of these at a local store and will be returning it today. The first time I used it I wasn't thrilled with it but it was better than the hose in my backyard. Yesterday I hooked it up to use it for a second time. When the water was turned on I quickly realized that something was very wrong. Water was spewing out of the bottom of the handheld unit in every direction. I turned the water off, disconnected everything and then tried again only to find myself being sprayed again. By this point I was wetter than the dog and she wasn't very happy either. I had high hopes that this would make bathing my dog easier but it is obviously not well made so instead of easier it was a mess. I called thier customer service but was told that they couldn't help me since I did not buy it from them. Thankfully the store I bought it at stands behind the products they sell since the company won't. This is also sold under the name Handy Groomer but it's the same product/same company."
1,Dog wash review,"After the second use, a piece broke that screws the hose to the unit. It is very difficult to get enough shampoo dispensed from the unit for the wash. I hardly get any shampoo to come out at all."
2,leaky,"this product is designed to make washing a pet easier, yet the faucet side leaked so badly the human would be the wet one.otherwise, i think the product is good concept."
1,Great concept but cheaply made,"I wanted a sprayer that could be easily turned off and on while bathing the dog. I liked that you could use your own shampoo unlike the rapidbath system. First off, this will only fit your sink. It won't fit the shower head. I took my shower head to Lowes and tried several adapters, connecters etc and the guy working there kept telling me I wouldn't find anything. After about an hour I believed him and gave up. So I thought I could hook it to the sink and just pull it to the tub, it was close enough and the hose was long enough. Then after 2 uses, it started leaking, everywhere! It was leaking at the connection to the sink, it was leaking at the connection to the sprayer and even from the sprayer itself. I just gave up and threw it away. It's a great concept and if I could find another one that is better made and would fit my shower I would definitely buy it. It would also be nice if they made one with two chambers so you could put your shampoo and conditioner in it."
4,No more mess!,"LOVE IT! Easy to use, easy to store and the dogs can't get away from me now because I have a free hand."
1,Save your money,"This is a great product, before it starts falling apart. After about a dozen uses... bathed the dogs, shampooed my hair, watered the plants... the plastic compression ring that holds the hose onto the sprayer broke. The sprayer is useless without it since the water pressure pops the hose off of the sprayer without the compression ring to hold it in place. Several hardware stores said that it is a proprietary piece and they had nothing that would work. I emailed the manufacturer... M2Pets... 8 times! I sent them my address twice and was told that a replacement piece would be sent, but after over a month of trying to actually get the piece...to no avail... I emailed them today and told them that I could not in good conscience recommend their product or their company. So I am out the $40 AND have to purchase a different sprayer.09-23-08 update: I finally got the replacement piece and it is working fine again..."
1,Leaky. Soap doesn't always come out well.,"This thing was a waste of money. It leaks at the faucet connection. Pressing the button doesn't always dispense soap, even when I put in the correct amount. I don't really see this working better than a shower head. Worse yet, my unit shipped with instructions in a different language! I did find the English instructions online but by then, I was already ready to toss this thing."
1,walking shoe,"This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned, and I would not recommend it to anyone. My left toes (all but the big toe) go numb every time I wear the shoe. Yes, I have the correct size of shoe; they're not too small. My toes don't feel cramped. It's just that for whatever reason, my left toes are always going numb. My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe (in the men's style obviously), and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb. My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk, not even walking. My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment, and his toes go numb while he's doing that. I've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood, and it happens every time. I am extremely frustrated because we're all stuck with these stupid shoes, which were expensive, because they've been worn a few times, and the store won't take them back now."
5,Total Knockout,"Thai Martial Arts films either tend to be weak on plot or too plot/theme-centric to be completely enjoyable (Ong Bak 3). The best of them tend to view their plots as merely incidental: getting Hero A to Position B to fight Villain C. This is one of those films... to the extreme. If you want your martial arts movies with a strong plot and emotional resonance (Really?), then you should look elsewhere. What you will find here is a wacky, intense, jaw-dropping spectacle where martial artists fight a giant, ax-swinging, flaming psychopath that could be Jason Voorhees' Thai cousin, a lunatic in a car, an asthmatic sadist, and probably the most insane ""under a tractor trailer"" fight you'll ever see. You'll finish watching this movie wondering how nobody DIED while making this film. And really, what more encouragement do you need than that?"
2,"Morris Robinson ""Goin' Home""","We were searching YouTube for singers of ""Goin' Home"" when we came across Morris Robinson. He was singing at the Crystal Cathedral and his performance of this song was very nice. His voice was rich and full, his timing in delivering the song was well executed. We were so excited to find his CD featuring the very song we loved. But, we were so disappointed. That one song is the only one we enjoyed hearing of those on the CD. The others feature accompaniment that nearly drowns out his voice. No one buys a CD like this to hear a full orchestra and loud choir; you buy it to hear the man's voice. The songs are not ""easy listening."" They are an intrusion. We put the DC away and rely on our Paul Robeson CD for the sounds we desired."
4,Robinson's Going Home,"I love Morris Robinson's rich, smooth sound. A couple of the accompanying instrumentals a little bombastic."
2,too much hype,"I heared a editorial about this guy on npr and it was pretty cool so i bought the cd. but in reality it is pretty cheesy and not very well organized. opera, gospel, and smooth jazz just dont go together that well. too bad cause morris has an amazing voice and it could have been a spectacular album, but i don't think they put that much energy into it. elevator music."
3,Bummed Out...,"I guess we should be grateful that the majority of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S show LEMMINGS has been preserved on CD- the show certainly showed off the talents of John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Tony Hendra, Christopher Guest, along with actress Alice Playten (OBC of OLIVER!, film of Tom Cruise's LEGEND).But VERY DISAPPOINTINGLY omitted from this CD is the Joan Baez spoof PULL THE TRIGGERS NIGGERS(""Pull the triggers, Niggers- we're with you all the way... right across the bay...""). As offensive and politcally uncorrect as the song is in its brevity, it's hysterically funny- and I'm bewildered why National Lampoon would edit the song out of this revue. Anyone know why?"
1,Not recommended,"This instrument was suggested to me by my internist. At his BP clinic, his medical assistants told me the systolic BP's measured by my OSZ5 were inaccurate. I called WA's service and was told this model couldn't be calibrated. They offered an exchange at no charge which I accepted. A few months later, the instrument fell 18 inches from my bed and landed on the floor. The battery compartment popped open and two small plastic pins broke off so the compartment would no longer stay closed. I sent it back to WA for repairs. They told me the instrument needed recalibration (I had been previously told that was impossible.) along with the repair. They quoted a charge of $75 plus shipping. Since I had paid around $110 for the unit, this seemed rather expensive.This took place while the instrument was under warranty. They said this repair was not covered. I told them to junk it."
3,"Adorable, but highly over-rated","I truly enjoyed this book. The plot was sweet, the characters even more so and it was easy to relate to. Though, I must admit, I found it a tad boring. Compared to some other manga out there it's no big deal. This story is about a young girl learning about love, friendship and growing up."
5,Great series,"I am surprised no one wrote a review about this anime. It is hilariously funny. Like the description says, it all starts out when Arumi and Sasshi jump into different worlds. They aren't sure how they get there but there are a few connecting facotrs about each world. Each world is a parody or spoof of some video game, anime or movie genre. It is worth watching if you want to laugh. I sponser an anime club and I brought this anime for the club to watch. The members in the club were 14-17 year olds and they couldn't stop laughing."
5,A logical and plain-English approach to Contingency Planning,"I own a medium-sized service company which depends heavily on our database records. Mr. Fulmer's workbook has enabled me to capably put together a disaster recovery plan which protects our business and our customers. His logical and plain-English approach has made a task I was dreading, easy to complete and put into action. I have recommended it to all my business friends.Mike McDonald, President - Second Family Elder Care Services"
4,Good Business Planning Tool!,"Our Real Estate Multiple Listing System, based in King of Prussia, PA, services over 18,000 customers in three states. We are a service-oriented business and require dependable, consistent computer systems and Internet connectivity in order to meet the demands in our marketplace. Mr. Fulmer's book has made it possible for us to develop and implement a solid business continuity plan, and to gain the enthusiastic cooperation of staff in putting that plan in place and maintaining it. The welfare of my company and staff depend on the security of our provision of services to our clients. Having used this book as a guide and reference, we are protected! Well done!"
5,my son loves it!,My almost four year old loves this car. It is very cool looking and works well. Fast in the 5 mph mode. Great sounds and working radio. He seems to be the envy of all in the neighborhood. My 1 1/2 year old loves riding in the passenger side too. Just wish it had seat belts!
4,Another hit!,"I like Jayne Ann Krentz because she knows how to build up the characters right from the start. I loved how to could envision the bar, the owner, the sort of skittish tourist. She described everything so that you wanted to read more and the more you read the more you were intrigued. Another grade A plus read."
2,Not what you want to read,This book was one of the most frustrating books I have ever read! The author dwelled on family relationships for most of the book and quickly concluded the book. The plot was questionable. I had never read this author before and will never read her again.
3,A good book but not perfect.,This was a good book but could have been better. The author seemed to repeat many things in one paragraph. The paragraphs and chapters could have been much shorter too. The good side of the book was the great detail given. I think it had a good plot and couldn't have ended any other way. I'm tired of all those fairy tale endings.
5,You gotta have this CD!,"The best thing about this album is that it is a true showcase of John doing what he did best....concerts. If you close your eyes, and listen, it's like you're right there. They included a good deal of song introduction, his talk with band members and the kids' choir, and interaction with the audience...one very important thing that made him so special to see live. Being a Christmas concert, it is also very unique in just that sense. Plus, I can always use a new live version of ""Calypso""! If you own nothing else of John's except the ""JD and the Muppets"" Christmas album, you should enjoy this just as much. If you own any other JD Christmas albums, you'll enjoy it more! The only downside may be some of the production, but it doesn't take away from the material in any way."
5,A Christmas Classic,"All John Denver live performances are great and this one is one of the best. John was at his best in front of an audience. And he loved singing with an orchestra, and what better one than the National Symphony. John's renderings of the classic Christmas songs are warm and wonderful. And one additional note, the photos in the liner are wonderful.... not that I'm biased because they were taken by my best friend."
5,ANOTHER CLASSIC!,Such a beautiful CD and John Denver's soft voice has you listening to this CD year 'round.
4,Excellent,"I was pleasantly surprised. I am a John Denver fan, but this exceeded my expectations. Liked the addition of the choir."
3,Nice artifical tree; looks like all other trees,"We did a lot of research looking for a Christmas tree that appeared to best represent the look we were going for and chose this tree because of the appearance of the downswept branches. The price at Amazon was also very good compared to other retailers. This is a very nice tree for the price but it looks like every other pre-lit tree I've seen. Disappointingly, the branches are not downswept like the picture at all."
4,Looks great and easy to assemble,It had been a dozen years or so since we last had an artificial tree. Boy how things have changed. Pre-lit and easy to put together- it was easy to get ready for the ornaments. Looks real enough to take away the need for a real tree every year. Worth the money.
2,Not As Full as Described,"After reading all the great reviews I was convinced this was the tree for us. We are used to having FAT, REAl Christmas tree for the last 30 years and reluctantly decided it was time to go artificial. Finding a fake full tree was a challenge. I searched the retail and wholesale stores. Costco and Bj's, Home Depot, Lowes, and our fancy Garden Center. While the tree does fill out nicely when you spread the branches, it falls far from the 70' diameter it states it is. On a GOOD reach it is maybe 60'. It is a pretty tree, but thin. The trees at Costco are nicer and for about $120 less!! The Costco trees also have the ""Feel Real"" branches all the way through, while this tree has just the tip branches molded (PE), but the not so interior branches are out of the old fashioned flat PVC needles. Don't know what I'm going to do. Tree's up... looks nice ... but I've seen better for cheaper....Going to see if I can return it..."
5,This book is excellent !,"The message applies to anyone living in an abusive situation and they should certainly read it. Straightforward discussions of partner violence and intimidation underscores the theme. This book is a strong wake-up call to the danger one may be in if they choose to remain, hoping an unbearable problem may disappear. The various women interviewd and the unique poetry makes this wonderful, sensitive book one I highly recommend."
5,Bass book,"Book is fine Good service some narkings that are to be expected with a used book, book is very usable."
4,Very Good,"This book is a very good and efficient way of learning of the positions officially. If you are an organized person and want a daily routine, this book is for you"
3,not shipped,"The book was just fine however, I bought it from an individual. I hadn't received this item in a few weeks. My son needed it for an orchestra class. I emailed the individual. He said he shipped it one day after I ordered it. I received the item a few days later postmarked the day after I emailed him. He was not honest about the ship date."
2,Not for Me!,This book is one of those highly detailed tomes on how to play the upright bass that is so complicated with music notation that no one in their right mind could ever learn from it. This book is only good for the very young who have infinite amounts of time and energy to devote to its study.
4,Excellent book!,"There's so much technique in this book, it's a must for anyone who wants to learn the doublebass. It's a little dry and there are no melodies (reason for 4 stars rather than 5 stars) so I also got the book ""The ABCs of Bass for the Developing Student"" Book 2, which went ""Beyond My Expectations."" It has 57 melodies and much more. You can read my review dated 10/16/05. It matches this Simandl book really well. I recommend getting both books!"
4,It's an ok book if you already have a teacher,"It is a great book full of bass music and a little, simple instruction.I am a professional, educated musician that plays seven instruments. I really needed something to teach me the particulars of this instrument. This book is not what I really needed, it only has a few pages about technique and practical information. But it is a good practice guide if you have a teacher that will go over those fine details with you."
3,Not from Vietnam,"For those who are looking for AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE fish sauce, this is not it...this is produced in Thailand like most of the fish sauce sold in the USA."
3,only four bucks at local stores,"This is the best fish sauce I tried for fish noodles soup (SE Asian dish with rice noodles, ""Khanom Jin"" in Thai, ""Mohinga"" in Burmese, ""Nyonya Assam Laksa"" in Malay). I pay a few cents less than four bucks at Latin/Asian/International stores in DC area. If you are in DC, you can find it in some stores including Latin groceries in DC Farmers Market. I am glad to find Amazon carries this brand but wish the same price as local stores."
2,This book is more of a soldiers personal life off the field,I found this book to be more of a chronicle of this soldiers life off the battlefield than what it meant to be a soldier in the field. The last chapter is devoted to his stint as a prisoner of war and how relatively easy it was to work the system. There were a few short accounts of his action on the front but not alot of detail. Wish it had more with only one descriptive engagement I can recall about action against soviet tanks and the tactics the gunners used to defeat greater numbers. Not for the serious historian.
4,bicone beads,"I loved how all the beads were packaged separately and labeled. However, I wish I had ordered something a little less vibrant."
5,Brilliant Rainbow of Crystal Beads,"I haven't seen this great of a price on these beads in any store, even with sales. Each color is separated and labeled in small zipper baggies, 10 beads of each color listed. Beautiful colors, great value."
2,Northern Nights a sure delight!,"I just finished reading this pretty thick book in just under 2 days and nights. That more or less means that I enjoyed it, because while I am a swift reader, this particular plot did keep moving very quickly and kept me interested.I did read the background of the author and did feel though, that while she created a very believable character in Issac, I felt that the behaviours of Elizabeth were not keeping with a prim and proper lady of the late 1800's- and possibly the author could have portrayed her just a bit more realistically. She seemed more a free spirit who would have been better suited to the 1960's with the quick abandoment of her virtues and beliefs.But overall I did enjoy this book- it produce that much wanted tugging at my heart strings at the appropriate climaxs of the book.Thank you Ms. Scott for a wonderful read."
2,save your money,"Sorry, Ryan Adams is a bit overrated and ""Answering Bell"" is certainly not one of his bitter moments. The live b-sides are ok, but actually rather boring. Spend your money on something else instead."
3,Good for Machine Design BAD for HVAC.,This product has a lot of definitions pertaining to mechanics and machine design. However it neglects the other aspect of mechanical engineering pertaining to HVAC and refrigeration. I used it for the PE but was really not much help since I took the HVAC and refrigeration portion.
4,Almost Makes It,"Almost is a terrific piece of fiction. It's got a great, original, engaging story, told in a slightly different way than you would expect. The plot takes many unexpected turns (all completely believable, however). The novel starts off with Sophy Chase telling us about her sort of boyfriend. They are both married to others (sort of) and it looks as if the novel will be the story about them. It's not. They are together at Sophy's, the phone rings and it's a state trooper telling Sophy that her husband was found dead. She frantically returns to his island home, expecting one thing, finding another, over and over again. The story is well written, well told, very enjoyable. Life is unpredictable, as is Almost. Enjoy."
2,Tedious,"I wanted to like this novel, I really did. The writing is good, but there is little in the way of plot. Sophy, the main character, is introspective, self-righteous and annoying to the point that I wanted to slap her. It is like reading a diary where nothing really happens. Towards the end of the book I literally slogged through the tedium and then the mystery of the book is never answered."
2,ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE,"Almost is a perfect name for this book. It's almost but not quite a story. It is funny at times, but when it tries to be serious it falls flat. The plot is contrived, the characters are shallow,and the story line is empty."
2,Leaves too much unsaid,"This new novel by Elizabeth Benedict has a compelling plot, but unfortunately, the characters aren't interesting, and there are too many details left unexplored for this to be an interesting read."
3,"Ok, after all","Well Elizabeth Benedict succeeded in painting a pretty neat picture that I wasn't able to appreciate until it was complete. I didn't really enjoy reading 'Almost'. It was kind of a tedious, repetitious ramble. All of the characters felt thinly developed which made them appear really unstable and shallow. I'm sure unstable was what the author was after, but shallow made them hard to connect with or care about. Then there was this strong `happy ending' closing paragraph that brought all of the rambling events into a very tight wrap and I was able to step back and enjoy. Interesting."
2,A good start that steadily declines,"A good story but the writing is lacking. One has the sense that the author has just learned the technique of foreshadowing, and uses it every other page to display her mastery. One is not left wondering why the author's other works are out of print, nor is one left with the sense that this book will do much to alter that fact. If the author is indeed a ghostwriter like her autobiographical narrator, then she should return with haste to a genre that does not demand of its writers a high degree of literary acumen."
3,"Dogora-More Crime Drama, Less Monster Destruction","Dogora is a decent movie. Personally, I have nothing against the movie. It is just more of a crime movie than a monster movie, which in this case, it is a good thing.The acting and the special effects are, as usual, very well done. The character of Mark Jackson is very entertaining. But it just doesn't equal the Godzilla series or other Toho creations like Space Amoeba, Varan, Frankenstein vs. Baragon, The Mysterians, and others.But don't let that spoil it for you. Buy this movie and enjoy it. It may not be the best monster movie, but it is a lot better than Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's Godzilla.So buy the movie and enjoy. It is worth the price. Check it out! :)"
3,dogora,Considering i've never seen this film before and i always enjoy watching new japanese monster flick(makes me feel nostalgic like a kid again)i say it was pretty good.I did'nt really enjoy the diamond heist plot but thats mainly beacause i've been tired of heist movies for years now.But considering it is not a godzilla flick and that the special effects for the monster was very good and trippy i gave it a three instead of a two.none the less its japanese cheesy and made by Toho so i recomend checking it out since the price ain'nt that bad.
4,With one of my favorite movie lines ever!,"All I can add to the previous adorations of this archetypical 1960's atomic monster movie is that Dagora kind of looks like somebody took a fake vomit from a gag shop, and then sprayed on some glue, glitter, & rhinestones. My favorite scene is when the gangsters are ""casing"" an apartment building from their Corvair-like car & the police approach them, asking what they're doing there, hanging out. The woman among the gangsters gestures at an open window with its curtains blowing through. The men of the gang all giggle and one of them says ""She's airing out her room,"", which sends the police on their way. Why this still seems so absurdly funny nearly 40 years later, I can't tell you..."
2,No drivers for pocket pc 2003,There is no drivers for pocket pc 2003 so don't buy this card if you use such OS.
1,Driver for pocket PC 2003 has to be downloaded,I just purchased the Linksys CF card for my IPAQ. The Driver for Pocket Pc 2003 isnt on the install disk. You have to download it from a ftp site at linksys! Problem is that the BETA driver isnt there! They put there ad that it is for 2003 but it isnt! Good luck in getting the driver!
2,"There Is No There,There!","I'll be brief unlike this ""concerto"". If you like musical bombast and scale running that seems to never end, goes nowhere, and leaves you feeling like you have been in a italian traffic jam this is your perfect musical vehicle. Enjoy"
5,Refuge is Must Reading for serious Christians,"Jim Bakker has hit the nail on the head with this new book. He gives frightening scenarios of the calamities that we are all heading toward and practical, Biblical guidance on how to deal with them both before they get here, and once they arrive. The answer is for Christians to come together as a true family loving one another and bearing each other's burdens. But don't think that this is the same old stuff you have heard before! Bakker gives a totally new take ( or a 2000 year old take) on this concept. Once you read this book, you will not view the Church the same as you did before. You will see it as a vital and exciting organism that God has a very special and specific purpose for. I highly reccomend this Book!"
5,Coupling - a must see,"This show is HILARIOUS. I have rewatched this DVD and had many other people watch it, and its still tears down my face funny every time."
5,Coupling: best British comedy since Fawlty Towers,"When someone asked me about Coupling, I told them, ""It's like Friends plus Sex in the City, only funny."" A snide remark, I know, but what can you say? American sit-coms give us gags; British sit-coms give us wit, humor, and outrageous laughter.I fear, though, that Coupling is over. The original six actors were, taken together, perfection - like the various strains of point and counter-point in Bach or Mozart. But then, tragically for the fans, Richard Coyle (Jeff) left the series. The remaining five, plus the new character, ""Oliver,"" kept it up bravely and well, but, in the end, Coyle's departure, depriving us as it does of Jeff, removed an absolutely essential 1/6th of the recipe. Oliver is good, don't get me wrong, but Jeff somehow was essential. To Richard Coyle, all I can say is ""OH, Jeffrey!!""To potential collectors, you won't regret buying any of these seasons, though."
1,Disgusted in Kansas,"I will not order anything from this company, again. This was ordered on 12-9-05 as a Christmas gift. Shipment has been delayed again and again. It still has not been shipped. Loser company!!!!"
1,A total waste of money!!!!,The book doesn`t have the guts to go out on a limb and make reccomendations on what the best quality to buy is or what a good diamond should cost. With out that why bother!!!!
2,This book does NOT properly prepare someone to buy a diamond,"Although the photographs are valuable, the book does not provide practical methods for determining color, cut and clarity. The information provided is too abstract and hard to apply in the jewlery store. The author doesn't provide specific information on diamond prices so you don't get an idea of how much you should spend on a diamond.I recommend reading ""How to Buy a Diamond: Insider Secrets for Getting Your Money's Worth"" by Fred Cuellar. His book contains detailed price charts on diamonds by every quarter-carat for every clarity and most color levels. He provides practical methods for determining color, cut and clarity (e.g. he advises putting each diamond in the crease of a white business card and if any yellow is visible, it's not above color level K). The latter book doesn't have glossy pictures, but it prepares you much better than this book for buying a diamond."
5,An invaluable resource for the inexperienced buyer!,I bought this book and several others to prepare me for engagement ring shopping. I shouldn't have wasted my money on the others. The book is clean and concise. After reading the book I was thoroughly prepared and confident to go out and shop for a diamond ring. I know I would have ended up with a much lower quality diamond and/or payed thousands more for an engagement ring and center stone without the expert advice from this book.
3,"Informative but not ""all-encompasing""","I had little knowledge of diamonds and spent several weeks researching on the web. I came across several glowing recommendations on this book. It's an enjoyable read and there are many colorful and striking photos. However, the author spends too much time covering topics like valuable ""colored"" diamonds and not enough time on specific tips on engagement jewelry. Personally, I would advise the thrifty spender looking for an engagement diamond to ""browse"" the web and just hit the jewelers. You could easily do without this book. Websites (...) were much more helpful than this book. (...) You can find out great information about the 4 C's anywhere on the web. You can find pictures, and most anything. If you would like to read one book and not spend so much time surfing, then this may be for you. But be warned, I picked up more information from surfing than reading this book."
4,A well-written guide with good photographs. Worth the money.,"Renee Newman is a jewelery industry insider, which blunts the usefulness of this guide as a tool for extracting best value from this particular sea of sharks. Nevertheless the reader is given a sense that they are being well educated. That the education takes place in the peace of your own home, well away from the persuasive jewelery store salesman is key. Take your time to study and learn.The guide covers diamond grading in detail, but doesn't advise which grades offer the best value for jewelery. Quality of cut is emphasised, with very good photographs to illustrate what can be a difficult area for the novice to grasp.Anyone contemplating making a significant diamond purchase should read this book. You will recoup the cost many times over !"
3,Not My Favorite Crown Album,"I don't know what it is about P13 that people are raving about. I guess it's a good Hard Rock album, but not a Death Metal Album or Hard Thrash like I'm used to when I think of The Crown. I really enjoyed the 2 previous releases much more. This album is slower and sounds like semi-fast paced Stoner Rock. P13 also gets pretty repetitive and boring in the middle and towards the end of the album. Tracks start sounding the same and the breaks become too predictable. Having Lindstrand back is good, but I also like the previous album with Lindberg. I guess it's really a toss up between the two. I say get Deathrace King and call it a day!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD because I wanted to hear again the songs that were on my dad's Perry Como Christmas records, and this seemed to have the largest collection. What I didn't realize when I bought it was that the songs I remembered hearing, such as ""There's No Place Like Home for the Holidays,"" ""O Holy Night,"" ""Here We Come A-Caroling Medley"" and ""Ave Maria"" were all recorded in 1959, whereas the bulk of the other songs on this CD were recorded in 1968 or later (one is even 1982)and these songs have a very different sound and style which I did not enjoy at all. Other people may enjoy these songs; however, if you're just looking for the traditional Christmas songs that helped Perry Como become famous, be aware that many of the songs on this CD are done in a completely different style."
5,Pure Perry! No One Better!,"About 70 minutes of music, and it sounds superb! This collection features career-spanning tracks...including several from his ""Seasons Greetings"" masterpiece album from 1959. Although this is not a ""Live"" CD, the huge variety of songs (including some you've probably never heard, and some that are not Christmas songs per se) remind me of what might have made up a Christmas concert set list by Mr. C. back in the day. ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" is truly special, and I love the alternate version of ""There's No Christmas Like A Home Christmas"" (less background vocals than the version I'd previously heard). One of the most pure sounding CD's you will ever own. Destined to be a Holiday favorite! By the way, incredible liner notes! Lots of great insights! Perry Como fans ....don't miss this one!"
5,Perry Como...just isn't Christmas without his sounds!,"Even though Perry Como is gone,the magic of the Christmas season perseveres in this collection of his recordings from RCA Victor. Two of my personal favorites are on this DVD collection...""There's No Place Like Home for the Holidays"" and ""Christmas Eve"". It just isn't Christmas without listening to the melodies from Mr. C!!!"
4,jatekok transcend being just sketches.imbued with something special.,"Kurtag has a very precise sense of what he hears but is often at a loss to find an effective means of notation (the Jatekok pieces with their flimsy notation are a good example)and then has fierce confrontions with players when they don't realise his intentions.For all this shoddy behaviour, the results aren't without an appeal,somehow transcending (only just)being a mere sketch.Most moving are the Bach transcriptions which are beautifully delivered by the fearsome duo of kurtag with his wife.They emerge seamlessley from the Jatekok."
2,More of the same,"While the book has some interesting points, most of these are repeated points from THE RULES (original issue) with slight, oh so slight, differences. No new perspectives and more repetition. And more or less the same as any other dating rule book. Save your money."
4,Perverting The Idea Of Feminism Has....,"Altered man/woman relationships for the worse....Even if we are in the 21st century, men and women will never be wired the same...The authors emphasis is doing what WORKS, not how we'd like things to work....Author OfBlack Women Deserve Better"
1,bunk!bunk!,bunk!do what u want when it comes to dating.like duh?i think the ruls book does have some common sense in it but then it goes off the deep end with some real nutty behavior suggested.if you do want to read this book-pick it up at your local library.and check it out with the mind-set that this is a total humor book. only.
2,save your money,I guess I should have purchased the first Rules book before getting this one. I just received this book today and read about half of it and skimmed the rest. The books goes on and on about The Rules but doesn't say much about it. It has advice for specific problems such as getting an ex back and online dating but doesn't talk about much more then don't call a man and let him pursue you. I learned nothing I didn't already know from this book. What a waste of money.
1,Totalitarian Gender Feminism,"The problem with ""The Rules II"" is the same problem as expressed in ""The Rules,"" namely, ""totalitarian gender feminism."" (See Amazon.com's synopsis of ""Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women"" by Christina Hoff Sommers.) Neither of ""The Rules"" books represents the legitimate goals of ealier feminists--equality for women in every aspect of American life. Both books fan the flames of ""the war between the sexes."" If you want to make male-female relationships worse than they already are in this country, just follow the rules!"
3,The Rules 2,This book was ok but I prefer the book how to date like a man! This book taught me nothing~ most of the stuff I already knew!! There were no big shockers on how to get a man!!
2,Rules I was better,"the first book, Rules I, was much better. a lot of the situations in Rules II did not apply to me and pretty much echoed what Rules I said. If you had to choose which to buy - buy the Rules I - that's all you need. Rules book are more effective than Barbara DeAngelis' books. DeAngelis books are a waste of time for women."
4,It works.,As outdated as this book seems and as many years as it seems to put womenkind behind...these things work.
2,A little bit dissapointed....,"A bit disappointing with the information content compared to the first book written. Chapters are a rather brief, author does not give much thought into putting depth into each chapter. I was looking forward to alot more content."
1,Mans point of view,"oh my*shakes headthis book is so dumbi would rather recommend that movie, ""the ugly truth"" it basically shows how somewomen are afraid to get sexual,i like the ending of the movie whhen it clrealy shows that the women stays annoying etc.. and she still ends up with a person she lovesid reccomend intimate connections by david d burns"
3,Satin lace bustier,"I was expecting more from this item. My bust size is 42, but the bustier is too large. The shoulder straps aren't adjustable, the front hooks are difficult to keep closed while re-hooking, not much cinch or lift...it's a really pretty piece of lingerie, but there is definitely room for improvement."
4,Good quality!,These are a great pair of lightweight headphones. I bought these headphones about a month ago and have gotten great use out of them. I highly recommend all Skullcandy headphones to everyone.
2,Not as listed,"I ordered these headphones for one specific reason... the ""in-line volume control"" on a pair that looked cool enough for an 8-yr. old. One bonus also listed in the description was a carrying bag. However, when the headphones arrived, it not only DIDN'T have the bag, but also NO ""IN-LINE VOLUME CONTROL""!!! I had to return them because they were not what I was looking for or wnat I thought I'd ordered."
3,Not bad,It's a decent price. It's a little thin on the stuffing. Seems to be better when both dogs are on it instead of one. I like the fact you can toss the whole thing in the wash. That makes it much easier to tolerate.
2,Flat like a pancake,"It was nice when we got it, the dog liked it but its 3 months old and flat, i was hoping it would last a little longer.Have the large size and hes a 90lb GSD."
3,Doggy Pillow,"I love how the pillow was big and fluffy, and fit both my little dogs. However, one of my puppies has a white belly, so when she would come in from outside from rain or snow, she would lay on the pillow and after a few days the pillow turned her belly blue. The pillow didn't come with washing instructions so Im not sure on how to wash the pillow or if the color will start to bleed."
3,"As pictured, OK quality","We have 3 large dogs (Two rotties and one catahoula). We go through beds all too often as the larger dogs are rough on them. I normally buy bedding from the big wholesale stores but at roughly the same price I wanted to give these a shot. They are essentially giant pillows (not bolster beds as other reviews mentioned). They might have a bit too much filling in them but I think it will compress. Most importantly, the dogs seem to like them."
1,Vegas Vampires,"My favorite actor in the entire film was Eric Etebari. He plays a perfect bad man and delivered his lines flawlessly and believably.In my opinion this is a campy poorly written, poorly edited, cliche filled tired vampire movie. There didn't seem to be any continuium although the first scenes promised a better movie. it goes downhill rapidly.The plot line was thin and the editing made a lot of assumptions that the audience would already know the backstory.Although some really good actors were in this film, Balwin's part seemed to be an afterthought. More of an addition than a necessary part of the film itself. There seemed to be a lot of overacting or maybe it was just overwriting. Yet in a perfect world, it could turn into a cult film with very little effort."
1,Agreed,"Just read the two below this one. I caught the last 30 minutes on cable waiting for something else to start, and everthing except the bald guy is grade-school amateur stuff."
2,disappointed,"I HAVE VERY BAD ARTHRITIS IN MY HANDS, SO WHEN I REC'D MY JAR OPENER, I WAS VERY HAPPY. THE FIRST JAR I PUT IN WAS TOO BIG, SO I HAD TO WAIT FOR A MAN TO HELP OPEN THE JAR. THE SECOND JAR, I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. IT WORKS GREAT ON SMALLER JARS."
5,gift,given as a gift to someone with arthritis in the hands - the person was thrilled and said it worked well
5,wonderful,"I eat these cereals everyday, and I would buy the box, the put in bowl everyday to take to work. With my hours most peoples lunch is my breakfast. The cafeteria where I work sell these at 1.99 a pop, which is even more costly than buying the box. I bought these when they were running on the extra specials and it is great, I just pop one in my lunch bag, buy either milk or yogurt at work and i have breakfast.Because of the sale, the price was right, the product is awesome.Could not ask for more."
3,"Still a great ""Adult"" selection of cereals, but","I first reviewed this product last year (now 2008, but showing original date for some reason). I used them for traveling, eating on the go, and for portion control. Great! Amazon has since raised the price by more than $5 and it is cheaper for me to buy them at the grocery store individually. Also, they took out the Kashi. There is too many regular Special K containers. The Smart Starts, which I do eat, are similar so it doesnt feel like an ""assortment"" any more."
2,Scam,"In the listing it lists four types of Special K Cereal. But when you receive the order you get alot of different Kellogg's cereals. Like Mini Wheats, Granola with Raisins, Go Lean Crunch, these are not listed, only the Special K is listed. So if you want a varity than this is for you. But I wanted just the Special K and Smart Start as listed. So I feel I was Scammed with a misleading add."
5,This is what I was looking for,"My cafeteria sometimes has Smart Start, and sometimes not. I decided it was worth buying this assortment. I'm not sorry it did. 60 packs will last me quite a while, though."
2,Not as described,"Assortment of cereals was not anything close to what was described. 2 types of cereals that weren't listed (neither of which I like), and not enough of the ones that are supposed to be there."
1,NOT as advertised,"This should have been Special K and Smart Start but I received a mishmash of granola, rice stuff and other reasonably healthy but not as ordered stuff. Special K and Smart Start were about 30% of the mix.Very odd for an Amazon supplier."
3,"Opened, Missing & Randomized","I've read the reviews and I should have probably listened. When I received my product I noticed right away that some were opened as the cereal was filling on the sides of the box. They were orderly cramped in, but the lids on 18 of those were half-way opened. After checking to see what and how many of each, I counted 12 Raisins w/ Granola, 11 Smartstarts Original, 11 Special K Fruit & Yogurt, 14 Special K Red berries, and 8 Special K Original cereal which in grand total added to 56 cups, NOT the 60 as advertised. I probably won't order this again unless Kellogg's can get their act together when distributing through Amazon.3 stars as the cereal does taste great, especially the Red berries"
3,INGREDIENTS,"This is an attractive item; however, I am disappointed that the Start Smart has partially hydrogenated oil in it, and therefore will have to forego this nice convience product.Also, it would be nice to see the nutritional breakdown, i.e., calories, fiber, carbohydrates, fat, et cetera."
1,Not very healthy,Partially Hydrogenated Oils?High Fructose Corn Syrup?There is nothing healthy about that.
2,Too much Special K,"Silly me - I thought 60 containers meant 15 of each of the four types of cereal. Instead, I got 22 of the plain Special K (my least favorite of the four) and only 4 of the Kashi (the one I really wanted). I'll eat them because I paid for them and they are convenient but I won't buy this ""assortment"" again.Unless you're a big fan of Special K, don't bother."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"I expected to receive a mix of the four cereals advertised, but I received eight Special K (advertised cereal), eighteen Special K with Red Berries (advertised cereal) and twelve Smart Start Healthy Heart (advertised cereal). This comes to a total of thirty eight of the cereals that I can eat.The balance was twelve Special K with Fruit & Yogurt (NOT ADVERTISED) and ten Granola with Almonds (NOT ADVERTISED), which I cannot eat due to serious allergies.Additionally, there was no Smart Start (my favorite) and the carton looked like the bowls were dumped into the carton. I had purchased this item before and received product as advertised and the carton was properly packaged.I had originally subscribed to a case every three months, but I have canceled due to this unadvertised product mix. I am deeply disappointed that I paid for sixty cereal bowls, but will only be enjoying thirty eight."
3,Good value,"Don't expect store-shelf quality when you open the box. We had one or two of the individual cups that were partially openned. I think that is to be expected. The cereal itself was in good condition. My wife loves cereal and it is nice for her to be able to grab one whenever she wants. She can just add milk, or take one on the road as a snack."
3,Assortment??,"First off, I love the fact that I can take them to work and just add milk. I also like this variety better because it doesn't have a bunch of sugar cereals in it. The only catch is the assortment isn't anywhere near what it is supposed to be and I only got 57.I haven't found any other place to find this product. All the stores have less variety and smaller sizes. Did anyone else find anything better then this?Would I reorder...yes because the pros out way the cons until I find something better."
2,Good But Not What I Expected,"I've read several wonderful reviews on this book and couldn't wait to purchase it. As a result, I bought the book based on the reviews alone. While I think that the recipes are excellent I would have liked to have read more ""snippets"" of stories accompanied with the recipes. I think the title of the book promises more than it delivers. Having said that, I recommend the book because the recipes I've tried so far are pure, simple and delicious."
5,A fun read,Most Italian cook books are much the same. This one is fun because it has included the stories of Italian life.
5,Authentic and delicious,"I cannot count how many cookbooks I have purchased that end up gathering dust. Ms. Sanders' book is an absolute delight and one that I go back to again and again. The recipes are easy to prepare and I love the menu and wine suggestions that accompany them. It is obvious that this book came from her heart and anyone who enjoys Italian cooking should definitely add this to their collection. I also love the beautiful photography on the cover by Ms. Sanders' husband, Walter. A must-have for all lovers of Italy!"
1,Do not buy it,"The on-off button does not work and after pressing it once too many times while trying in vain to switch it off, the button collapsed inside.Now I am going to return this item to amazon."
2,Why Can't the English?,"This disc has the same content as was heard on the original Broadway cast album. The score is still enjoyable. the performances here are disappointing. Chita Rivera sounds tired and seems to be forcing her voice. Peter Marshall wrestles with his musical segments and lacks the charisma that Dyke Van Dick brought to the role. The kids are all terrible here, and several wrong notes slip through in the orchestra. Why is it that the British just can't do justice to American musicals??"
2,Not what I expected!!,"I suggest you don't get this bag if you're looking to CARRY it. Despite the picture above, this bag does NOT have handles. I was very disappointed as I am a college student on campus all day and can't even carry this stupid bag. I'm keeping it just for protection reasons, but I suggest you go elsewhere if you need a PRACTICAL bag."
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap,1. You do not receive the bag that is pictured...there are no handles2. I cant see how this THIN bag is goign to actually protect the tablet.3. There is a slot for your pen but there is no way to carry the mouse in the bag .I'm sure case logic puts out a better quality bag
1,What a waste of money.,"As other reviewers have posted, this bag is cheap, thin and NOT the bag pictured. Its a thin sleeve of neoprene with the logos screenprinted on one side. There are no carry straps and the Wacom tablet BARELY fits into the sleeve (rounded corners on sleeve, squared corners on tablet). I broke the zipper on the second use.DO NOT BUY THIS BAG! Any other neoprene protective sleeve would be better for your tablet."
3,6x8 Bag,"Like several other people have said, the 6x8 bag does not have handles! I prefer my regular mouse to the intuos mouse, so not having a pocket for that is not an issue, but if you prefer the intuos mouse, you may be a bit annoyed with the lack of a pocket. I simply wanted extra protection for my tablet when I slip it into my laptop case, so the lack of a massive amount of padding is not an issue for me, but this would not work well as a standalone case for hauling your tablet around. I WOULD love a zip pouch or something of the sort for carrying extra nibs, as I tend to switch back and forth between the white nib and the felt one, but that's my only major complaint."
3,Wacom travel bag,"well, I bought it because this item has been shipped to me repacked. It protects your Tablet.In my opinion this bag is overpriced. You will not fit anything in it just a tablet, there is no part where you would stick pens and other devices. Even the USB cable attached to tablet makes problem to fit. It makes it bulky and can scratch the tablet. I would consider pretty well before buy, there must be other bags, than this one.Nearly forgot to mention: The zip is not so great. I have it damaged already. ;("
1,"FALSE ADVERTISING! NO HANDLES! It's a sleeve, not a ""Travel Bag""","I was very upset when I got this product home to see that it wasn't anywhere near what I had ordered. I was positive that a company like Wacom would make other good products and wouldn't falsely advertise, but as much as the image they chose to sell the bag with obviously has handles, It ACTUALLY has NO handles, which is why I purchased it in the first place. The material also isn't very strong, so look somewhere else for your Wacom tablet protection.INTUOS3 6X8 Travel Bag"
2,Not as advertised,"I didn't read all the reviews before purchase, and thought that the bag actually had handles as stated. It says there is room for all the accessories, but there isn't really. The stretchy material will accommodate the other things, but they stick out of the bag awkwardly. And no handles to carry it! I'm disappointed."
3,"It does the job, but has virtually no extra storage","It does the job. It pads and protects the Intuos tablet. You can squeeze the stylus in the top of the bag, but the USB cord and the stylus holder have to be hung outside or carried separately. So remember, this is a protective pad, not a carrying case."
2,Barely fits the 6x8 tablet,"I was really disappointed in this product; was expecting a lot better for the price. The rounded corners of the bag barely cover the 6x8 tablet. Forget using the zipper! I think it will offer adequate protection - thus I'm keeping it...and not giving just a one-star rating. That, and the hassle of going thru the return process- ugh!But... Buyer beware. It's barely OK. I would buy a different product next time. Two-stars."
1,Not for Intuos4,"These neoprene sleeves (which fit Intuos3 tablets) are too small for newer Intuos4 units with the same sized screens... less expensive rival brands don't have the large, cartoon-ish logo on the frontSearch ""neoprene laptop sleeve"" for more choices"
1,Needs More Scientific Backup,"While this is an adventure story, and that's why I bought it because of the intriguing title and cover, I was very disappointed. It is written in a sophomoric style that reminded me of the old Hardy Boys adventures. We have to believe everything he says as he says--with the Bible as the only sourse of reference. He needs backup from trained archaeologists who have worked in the field, in the Middle East, their whole lives.Don't bother buying it anyone, unless you just like Bible stories."
3,To Wish You a Merry Christmas is better,"This collection is not as nice as the To Wish You a Merry Christmas album which contains original 1950's selections. Some of these seem over-produced, and some selections jump out at you because they don't fit with the rest."
5,Harry Belafonte is the best!!!,"I grew up with his wonderful voice. It is the most beautiful and comforting album I have. Belafonte's arrangements are unique, and the emotion in his voice gives me chills."
2,Swiss trains on film,"The picture, obviously copied from VHS, was a little grainy, and not really up to date close to this year. More like it was filmed in the 1980's. I would think twice before buying this."
5,The guys are back!,"Someone once told me, ""There's not such thing as a bad O'Jays album."" I'd have to say they are correct. One of my all-time favorite groups, if not my favorite. They've never disappointed me. Eddie and Walter are still in there hangin' tough with a new guy, who is quite good.What's great about this one is the O'Jays themselves produced it. It's very smooth and mixes some of today's soul grooves with their own classic sound. ""Long Distance Lover"" and ""Let's Ride"" start off this great CD and the great sounds just keep coming. ""I'm Ready"" and ""Put out the Fire"" and two other excellent tunes.The fellas are back and they still got it! O'Jays forever!"
2,Bad Capacitors,"I had this motherboard for 5 years. I never overclocked the CPU, always watched the temperatures, andit got unstable and locked up for good. Examined it and found several electolytic caps swollen.Intel apparently had this problem (along with other manufactuters around 2004-2005).My original Circa 1984 IBM PC XT still runs!Too bad, since it was easy to put a system together around this."
4,Excellent film,"Must say that I did not watch this film in DVD format so I am not sure if the version I have is the full film or the shortened one. The VCD I bought was from [...] which ships direct from Bangkok. My product was intended for home viewing in Thailand, not for mainly export/international audience. I really enjoyed the film, Thai culture is complex and Royal culture much more so. The Prince of Thailand made this film,it is a film not so much a movie, so yes, it can be slow at times and painfully detailed but it should be. This is a film to learn some of Thai history and culture, not just to be entertained. I really loved it."
5,Excellent historical film,"Legend of Suriyouthai is a classic historical film of Thailand. If you are Thai, married to a Thai, or have Thai background, you should see this film. The Queen of Thailand personnally ordered this movie be made so the Thai people will know their background. The diretor is a Thai prince; the movie female star is a Thai princess. Francis Ford Copula went to film school with the prince. Excellent film!"
5,Great movie,"I have to give this one 5 stars because I enjoy it so much. The picture is very sharp and clear even om my DVD xbox player but on to my 720p HD TV. I wathched this show be for on Thai version that is 3-1/2 hours on some VHS tape that not so clear. Wow what's a deferent. I am Thai so I under stand the story well, but on this DVD there are a few explaination to make it better under standing. So if you want to see how Thai history in compare of Japan, Korea, Chaina, history movie this movie will take you in to very deferent of culture of Asian. It is the wonderful way to enjoy, and see how the Asian culture are not really the same."
3,The Legend of Suriyothai,Gruesomely violent and tedious with poor character development. However visually beautiful from the costumes and sets. Interesting and complicated storyline. Shows women as a powerful force despite the lack of character development.Set in 16th century Thailand (Siam).SubtitledFilm is 154 minutes long...
3,"Good enough, I guess...","I read this book in what I guess what probably the 6th grade, because around that time I loved whatever had the name ""R.L. Stine"" written on it. I knew from the start these books weren't written by him, but I still gave them a shot, because after reading the first two (the best ones of the series) I decided to stick around for the ride. I have only a fadey memory of this book, but remember that the plot of the book was pretty good and kept you involved. The ending was a pretty cheap pay off, and ruined basically what would have been a decent read. But, then again, you could see one of them crazy endings coming from the beginning, because as it built up, that ending was the only way to really pull off the story without it looking totally rediculous. And it was a Ghosts of Fear Street book, and most always ended like that (Ex. ""The Boy Who Ate Fear Street"" and ""Night of the Werecat"", to name a few). It's an okay read if you don't mind the helpless ending."
4,Save a Catskill heirloom.,"Dave Brandt's video is good information for those who enjoy tying and fishing Catskill style dry flies. Learn his methods and you will be able to tie nearly every Catskill dry fly pattern from the old masters. Dave spends a lot of time going over materials and details of the tying techniques he uses and most tyers should be able to follow along. His style is his personal distillation of others techniques he has seen over the years. The end result is the same but the road to get there may have some new turns. My criticism is Dave stating he prefers to use modern parachute style flies for his own fishing. He should have left that out as it detracts from the overall enthusiasm for this style of fly that I find still works as good as anyone else's pattern. I give Dave creds for honesty, however."
4,Pet crafts,"I was looking for patterns to help me make winter clother for my dog. I was able to get some ideas and helpful information with this book. But, it is not solely for dogs or dog clothing."
1,stops working in 1 minute,"I put a photo CD in. After 1 minute viewing, the system stopped responding. The CD is trapped in the machine."
2,Noisey & Hard to Work,"I liked the size and the retractable gate feature appealed to me greatly; however, after about a year the spring mechanism gave way - so now it is of no use. I used it only occassionally when my grandchildren were visiting. In order to pass through it must be retracted, which makes a terrible noise, waking babies and scaring them. I was the only one that could operate it, even after we had written directions on it."
3,Some bad with the good,"Had to call distributor to buy TWO other install kits for this gate, another $55 for the two kits (one if you have molding, one for other size bannister).I find it impossible to close one handed (with your child in your arms), and tough to open one handed (but do-able).Hard to install (as someone else pointed out)There are a lot of goods to this gate, absolutely, but also so bads."
3,"Great idea, needs some improvement.","I had high hopes about this gate despite some of the reviews from here and others. Some reviews said it was noisy, I was able to open it properly and quietly. It was easy to install. I like the fact that you can have it open and out of the way. However, it is hard to open and close without using two hands. You need to beable to latch the bottom and top while manuevering the lock button. It mostly takes some time because of the top and bottom catch if the catch was made to catch easier it would be a great product. If you need to easlily get to the other side in a hurry, this gate is not for you."
5,"Train Your Dog, Change Your Life","I found this book to be extremely helpful and easy to read with ""down to earth"" information and examples. To reinforce the information, there are also very helpful ""homework"" assignments that are easy to incorporate into a very hectic schedule. Results were obvious within the first two weeks - my puppy suddenly started listening and responding just the way I wanted him to! THANK YOU!!!"
5,Read this book for a Really Great Relationship with your dog,Readers all over the world are better off because they can benefit from the Ross's great pet dog training advice.Pet dog owners in Southern New Hampshire have been benefiting from their classes for years.
5,What about the bonus Rutger?,"Bounty hunter Nick Randall (Rutger) is alleged great-grand son of famous TV bounty hunter Josh Randall (played successfullyby Steve McQueen back in the 50's). Rutger may not be apsycho (The Hitcher-'86), a space con (Blade runner-'82) ora blind white Samurai (Blind Fury-'90) but no problemo!Gene (I was the masked bass player of KISS) Simmons takesover. After the absurd hermaphrodite creature he featured in a John Stamos movie (Never too young to die-'86), this istrully brilliant casting (though not very politically correct,I mean him being a Jew and meanwhile portaying an Arabterrorist in this movie). If you're a fan of action movies you have already seen this one. If you're not, hey, let me tellyou this: The end scene with the grenade stuffed in Gene'smouth is one of World Cinema's all time classic scenes and itmakes this movie a must-see just to hear Rutger say hisfamous BONUS line.....!"
4,wanted dead or alive,"I have been a fan of Rutger Hauer since BLADE RUNNER,I think he is a fabulous actor and does justice to any part he is in.Wanted dead or alive is no exception, he gets the bad guys like no one else, i get a real kick of satisfaction as he disposes of each villan.The guy from KISS with the big tongue did a suprisingly good job as the terrorist to. LOVED IT....."
3,Rutger's the man ......,"Saw this movie years ago and decided to get it on DVD. Fun movie with plenty of action. Rutger had plenty of potential when he started, but his potential never really blossomed."
4,A Fast-Paced Thriller,"Rutger Hauer stars as Nick Randall, a former CIA man turned bounty hunter. He's a steely nerved, icy professional who rounds up the scum of society for very high prices. But now, Randall finds himself as bait in a tug of war between the CIA, FBI, and LAPD. Once the hunter, Randall has become the target of international terrorist Malak Al Rahim, played by Gene Simmons of the rock group KISS. What once was a job for Randall has become a mission; get Al Rahim at all costs!The action in this movie is well done. Simmons does an excellent job as Al Rahim, and the pace is fast. The special effects are dazzling, and Rutger Hauer has some good one-liners along the way. If you're a fan of good action and shoot 'em up movies, then this movie should be included."
5,Fantastic Action Film,"This movie is probably 25 years old. But it is a great action, drama movie. My dad and my son and I watched it over and over on HBO years ago. I had been looking for it for a long time. Thank you Amazon for having such a great selection.Rutger Hauer is a great actor and Gene Simmions, yes from the rock band Kiss, is one of the best bad guys ever. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and the ending will blow you away.Hauer plays a bounty hunter who is ex cia and he makes reference to the old tv show of the same name with Steve McQueen for those of us who remember back that far, he is supposed to be his great grandson. Like I said a Great Action Move with a blow away ending."
5,Wanted: Dead or Alive,"I remember seeing this movie when it was originally released and thinking this was a little far-fetched, but it was a pretty good action flick. Little did I know how, for lack of a better term, ""prophetic"" it would be. We need ol` Rutger now.Anyway, it`s still a good action, shoot `em up. I`d recommend it to anyone."
1,A note about The Barbra Streisand Christmas album,"Dear Sirs: I chose one star because of the packaging of the cd. It has 3 large cracks on the cd plastic cover. I did not open one the seal because I did not know if the cd was damaged on the inside. I have reported this to the seller and Amazon , but I have not heard back any replies. John Nestra"
2,Over-the-top Depressing Songs That just Seem to Be Trying Too Hard,"I love Christmas Music and I really enjoy listening to Barbra Streisand's Singing. That being said, other than the jingle bell's, which is the first song, we don't enjoy any of this album. It is full of very mournful sounding music. The entire album again, outside of the first song (jingle bells which my kids and I find super fun to dance to) sounds like a dirge. I really enjoy soft songs but this was very depressing sounding music throughout... just not our favorite. We will be passing this on for a white elephant gift or to someone who says they would love it and just purchasing the digital version of jingle bells."
4,A Treasure's Trove,SUPER FUN!!! Apart from the idea that their are real treasures hidden for someone to find the book has an intriguing mystery about it...The graphics are very colorful and beautiful and the puzzles are engaging I would definatley reccomend it. I couldn't comment for older children my daughter is just one year old and she loves the bright pictures.fyi the first review is hateful...you could read hate and porn and racisim into just about anything these days if you try hard enough...the book is none of those things!!! Darkness is tipically an evil thing in many fairytales GET OVER IT!!!
5,Love it,"I don't know WHAT that first reviewer is talking about! I think they're out of their mind (or are just pissed because they are too ignorant to figure out the puzzles in the book) It's an awesome book, really good story, intriguing. I love fairies so I love this book. It's even more fun to know there is a real treasure behind it!"
5,This book is so much fun!,"I first heard about Laura Corn's books on the WNCI Morning Zoo, where they would ask listener couples to try one of the sealed pages. It sounded like so much fun, I bought one. The clerk, however said she couldn't help laughing when people called to check availability and she had to say ""No, we don't have 'Sex' but we do have 'Quickies' or 'Romance'."" :-) My husband and I tried it out last night, and I can already tell that this is going to be one of the most fun books I ever bought. Now I just wonder what the ""Laura Corn Challenge"" page is? Hmm..."
1,Did a grandmother write this?,"Quickies? I don't think the author knows what a quickie is. These ideas she has for quickies are A) a little too involved to be quickies and B) they're BORING! Eating food off your partner's body - wow!- no one's ever done that one before! Undressing your partner in front of a mirror. What is this stuff? You've probably done more on a first date than most of what you'll find in this book. Not to mention, I object to the entire concept to begin with. It offends me as a male. We're already the gender that has to ask to have sex, now this woman wants us to turn in paper work and then wait to hear back in 5-7 days! Forget it!"
2,Disappointing,"Having read Laura Corn's The Great American Sex Diet, I thought I'd read another excellent guidebook written by this insightful therapist. However, 101 Grrreat Quickies is a major disappointment. The ""quickies"" Corn refers to in the book -- eating food out of each other, doing the deed in front of a mirror, etc. -- are banal and uninventive. I expected to get advice I hadn't already known -- otherwise, I wouldn't bother to read this sort of book. Looking for a great sex guidebook? Skip this one and read Corn's The Great American Sex Diet instead."
1,A little lacking in creativity,"This book would probably be good if you grew up in a box and had zero previous sexual experience. The ""quickies"" are anything but quick. Some of the 10 we opened before disposing of this piece of garbage required items such as a long stem rose... chocolate truffles... a lot of food. Not really suited for a quickie. This book may be a good start for an 18 year old virgin... but if you've been sexually active for more than a couple of years, and watch TV/movies occasionally I doubt it will bring any new ideas. May be a bit hard to clean-up in time to get back to work on your lunch break if you've got to shower to wash all of the peach syrup off of your body.-Just my two cents"
3,Okay,"This book is Okay. It's not original but we still try to have fun with it. It does suck that they're not really quickies though. Although if you have a free night, some of them are good :)"
3,not compatible with mac,"the image quality is amazing, the audio is not great , it is not meant to be used with Mac computer which is very surprising with today's technology!!"
1,Did not work-had to return-utter frustration,"Don't think this was Sonys' fault. They have great products, but this camera was broken on arrival-auto focus didn't work. Also, and most annoying, it was clear that the box had been opened and tampered with prior to shipping. This one is on Amazon. Return was a hassle, won't use Amazon again."
1,No Viewfinder!!!,"I was prepared to order one when a friend bought one and I had a chance to try it out. What is wrong with Sony (and Panasonic and others)? There is no viewfinder and trying to shoot in bright overhead sunlight using that LCD screen is lousy. Obviously these viewfinder-less cameras are not aimed at anyone serious about video work. I had planned to get one of these to supplement my 3CCD primary cameras because small size is an advantage in some places, but no viewfinder makes it impossible. I would have given this a 0 star rating, but that wasn't a choice here."
3,Not Compatible wih Mac,"The camera works great, but it does not work very well with a Mac. Sony's software is only for PC, which is hard to believe in this day and age. There is a way to make it work in iMovie, but I hope you have a few hours to download your video. Anyway, like I said, I'm not complaining about the camera itself (which is great), but I am very frustrated that this is even an issue."
4,sony hdr-cx7 avchd,The avchd software does not work with vista 64 bit PC's. The camcorder is very good.
3,Proprietary formatting makes this worthless!,"In this day and age, when everyone (except Sony, of course) is moving toward universal standards, I am disgusted to find Sony's camera produces video based on a proprietary formatting. In order to retrieve the video, you must use THEIR software... which SURPRISE!... is only provided in a Windows format. Therefore, as a Mac user I am unable to download the videos to my computer for movie creation. Sure... I can purchase ""Parallels"" and ""windows"" for a sum of about $200 more, so I can install their software, but why should I have to install that ridiculous operating system? And there are some extremely contrived work-around processes for me to get the video moved from one format to another, but I have yet to find one that actually works. If you are a Mac user.... DO NOT buy this camera; it's not worth the hassle!"
4,Colud have been a little better,"Nice stills and regular resolution video. On full resolution HD image is great but breaks up when panning, better if camera is standing still or panning very slowly.Would buy it again."
3,How to watch and edit,"This camera will most probably satisfy any amateur cameramen who is buying it for the very nice occasions ahead of them. This was my case.For me it was totally satisfactory until I wanted convert them to .avi files and try to watch them in Windows Media Player or my divx player.I have found a converter software that is taking a century to convert and the file sizes are increadibly big. 1,7 GB for a 15 min. video and to tell you the truth I am not satisfied with the video quality after conversion. I would very much appreciate if someone knew how to help me. Before you make this purchase, I highly recommend that you find how to convert files into industry std. extensions with acceptable file size and good HD qualities."
4,A really good read,"This is the first book I've read by the author and certainly not the last. Western literature is not really my forte, but I'm sure if you read this book, you will become a fan. My only complaint is that the chapters were too long and there was'nt any good stopping points to close the book. Anyone who reads as sporadically as I do, knows what I'm talking about. Great characters as well."
4,Very good western adventure,"'Killoe' is packed with interesting characters, lots of gunplay and fights with Comanches and several plot twists keep this one movin' right along.Worth the effort if you are getting back into western reading. Good stuff.Four and half cactus for this one.Crunch Hardtack"
5,Step back to your childhood!,"As a child growing up in the 60's, my favorite pasttime was swiping my 16 yr old sister's 45's and playing them while whe was out on dates. These CD's look so much like a 45, it'll take you right back to your youth! They burn perfectly, they look cool, and they're just plain fun! I burned a pretty important sales presentation on one of these jewels, and, well, I'm not sure if the audience liked the presentation itself or the CD the presentation was on - but I got great reviews!"
5,Fantastic Nostalgic CD's,"It's about time people came out with this retro idea!It's fantastic! The design takes me back to the good ole' days.A bit of a problem when you want to write the title on the surface but hey, it's just like the old thing."
2,"Someone else said it- great idea, poor execution","The books promises more than it actually delivers. It's attitude towards other monothesitic religions is condescending, and the feeling of elitism is present through the entire book. Furthermore, the author compounds this by ""fluffy"" statments on the nature of Pagan practice and a seeming ingnorance not only on the more spiritual levels of Witchcraft, but also on many of the questions he tried to answer himself!I bought this book to help a loved one understand my religion, and now I see all I have done is waste my money."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Many introductory books exist that purport to explain this material. However, WSYLIW is written so smoothly, and presents such a balanced and well-researched viewpoint, that it wins my premier recommendation.McColman thoughtfully and succinctly dispels the false myths that surround Wicca with a loving tone that respects all religions (no bashing here). This necessity for mutual respect and love echoes (rightfully so, IMHO) throughout his work. Furthermore, unlike many authors who couple shimmering content with narcoleptic prose, McColman presents 1st-rate background information with a flowing, extremely approachable style that will captivate the reader.I would even recommend this as an introductory book to those who are interested in Wicca themselves and seek an unprejudiced prospective."
2,"In a way, kinda dangerous","This book regularly oversimplifies and misrepresents Wicca and other forms of Paganism.While some will chalk this up to his target audience, ""Concerned Friends, Nervous Parents, and Curious Co-Workers"" are the *last* people you want to be seen as being over simplistic to.I gave this work to my sister, unread... big, dumb mistake because within days she was pointing out the differences between what she has witnessed me practice for 23 years and what this book seemed to say I was practicing.I understand the need for such a book, but this one is just *too* oversimplistic, and his definitions are often awful.I just keep imagining a teen buying this for a parent who is really antiwiccan and getting in worse trouble when that parent interprets the oversimplication as *lies*.That being said, well, if you give it to people who know he over simplifies, you should be okay, but *do not* give it to someone who is already biased as a cure because it will just make things worse."
