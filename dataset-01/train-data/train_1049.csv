1,Had none of the adventure of the first,"My expectations were somewhat high after the quality of the fist book. I was very disappointed at the lack adventure in this second book. There was a lot written on wall hangings and feelings and clothing - but just not much adventure, fantasy or plot. There was an awful lot of repetition - I mean near duplicate paragraphs about what had already happened. So I plodded through it with the excuse that it was just a bridge to the third in the trilogy."
3,Disappointed having such great expectations after book I,"I'm sorry to say that I feel let down by this book. I really have to put myself to finishing reading it to the end. Book 1, I thought was delightful in its detail, and wonderfully imaginative, innovative and creative. A feast for a hardcore fantasy reader. But in book 2 nothing new happens. No new features, no new people, no new supprices. A lot of not interesting ('cause its repeating itself) politics, and moving around with the same persons we have met in the first book. Rather boring. The situation of the hero is desperate from the start and remains this in an oppressive way. I've bought book 3 nevertheless. Still hoping that some of the quality I've seen in book 1 will return."
3,"Great writing, but a berserker or an assassin?","An assassin who fights with the berserker rage, who wields anaxe and gets strength from a wolf. Good imagination, and funto read too, but Hobb's character lacks the characteristicsof a true assassin. Also impossible to notice is the factthat the hero ends up completely helpless at the end of eachvolume, and gets rescued by either one or a couple offriends. I enjoyed the book, but it left me repeating thecliche, ""Could have been better. """
4,Another good installment,"Robin Hobb has created another good installment that grabs ahold of you and keeps you reading. You feel for the characters, you feel their pain, pleasure, happiness, loneliness, you have sympathy for them. This isn't to say that the characters are not stretched a little thin sometimes, but you overlook that by how Hobb writes.One downside to this, and thus four star, is that Hobb seems to have written herself into a corner and had to end the book as best she could. The ending is a little for wanting because it seems especially far fetched. She does explain it away, so it does work on a small scale, but I wish it would have ended better (and yet it still evoked emotion).Despite the disappointing (almost, but not complete disappointment) ending I would still run out and get her final installment. Her writing draws you in and leaves you wanting more, and you can't ask for anything better than that."
4,book review,Book started off slow but picked up. The ending could have been better written. Characters ended with the story in terms of development.
4,I'm hooked.,"This is a great fantasy story, more true-to-life than magical, which is one reason I like it so much. I'm on book three of the trilogy and would recommend it to a friend."
2,This book could have been 100 pages shorter.,"I rarely say a book I am getting enjoyment out of should be shorter, but that is most certainly the case with this one.The first thing that should have been left out is about 60 pages of self loathing and uncertainty. In this book, the main character is hardly an assassin, which makes the title misleading in the extreme. He is more of a professional whiner, which begins to grate on you.But other people have mentioned that in their reviews, the one thing I haven't seen voiced is that the other 40 or so pages that could have been left out were the love story. Molly, the love interest of the main character, has no redeeming qualities at all. She is the least appealing love interest I have ever come across. She is paranoid, rude, surly, illogical and totally unreasonable. It's not a crime to write an unappealing love interest, but it seems evident that we are supposed to feel bad for Fitz when he loses the girl. I just felt relief."
5,Hobb is a wonderful crafter,"Fitz is having fits - and the kingdom seems to be seeing the start of entire rupture. He must choose to either stay with his King as a King's man or go on his own - but truly - does he have a choice?Hobb certainly has a way of bringing light to things - there but just not seen by a reader. This book has everything - a love story, hatred, revenge, loyalty, political intrige, honor, and working for the better of a people.A great lesson can be learned by seeing the dedication some will take to see out that others can live better. Hobb does a great job of seeing through hardships and comming out the otherend - beat and broken, but knowing what one must do.Fitz is only getting better , as a character, every book I read. Do yourself a favor and read The Farseer Trilogy."
1,One of the worst I've read,"The first book in the series was decent. Not good, but not bad enough that I stopped there. This book is something else. It really is one of the few worst books I've ever read.***Vague spoilers follow***Everyone in it is unbelievably and unfathomably stupid at all points of the story. They allow friends and family to be killed and the kingdom basically ruined because, well, what, they're supposed to do something about the villain they know to be evil and bent on killing them and who lives in their power?The plotting was so bad and the characters so stupid (as a necessity for the terrible plot to work), I was angry with the book by the time I was a third or so of the way though. Probably less."
5,Up there with the best of fantasy,"To be honest, I can't remember where this book started or stopped. The series is so good throughout the three books I basically read it from beginning to end as one story. It's not very often an author can keep readers totally engaged for that long.Fitz matures but keeps learning lessons the hard way. We get to know his mentors better and see the story develope more. But you'd have to be crazy to stop all the way to the finish line. Hobb doesn't let up with gritty action sequences, surprises and the story's momentum.Hobb is now my third favorite fantasy author behind Tolkein and George RR Martin. If you like the latter, I think you'll love this series - and you can finish while you wait for Martin's fourth book to get published!"
3,Dry.,I really wanted to like this book! But I didn't really feel much for the characters andthe switching back and forth from character to spirit was not what I expected.Half way through I had to give up. Sorry.
3,Interesting Read,"Sapphire's Grave was an interesting read, but I must say you really had to understand the characters. Sometimes I found the reading to be a little disconnected at the beginning. I continued to read this book just mainly because of the different characters. Even though I gave the book three stars, I must say I did love the ending."
3,my kids like it,"The acting in this movie is not very good, but my younger elementary aged kids really like this, so that is what counts. As a very conservative mom who vigilantly keeps track of what my kids watch, I am glad they like it and it is one of the very few movies that they are allowed to watch on their own (since I previewed it first)."
4,Old and poorly printed but a translator's classic.,"We use Das' dictionary in the intermediate classical Tibetan translation class. The only alternative for those who need both the English and Sanskrit equivalents is Jaschke, which is antique. Students who read and understand Chinese may find the Chinese-Tibetan dictionary a better tool linguistically."
3,"Good, not amazing","It is a good shave cream, but Noxzema for Sensitive skin is better. I bought this item expecting the same result of the red one."
2,average shaving cream,"Well, i wish i would not have gotten this. i was expecting much more. This actually makes my face feel less smooth and makes it break out more than any other shaving cream i have tried."
4,Strange very Strange,This movie is not for everyone but a very artistic achievment a visual nightmare almost totally created by one man
3,Incomplete specs,"The mower is well made and works fine. Sadly, the specs failed to mention that the minimum cutting length is one inch. This is just as important a spec as the 14-inch cutting width. The product summary should include the important specs and limitations. My carpet grass is now going to look like SHAG GRASS."
1,Rings in the mower,Instructions totally inadequate about how to insert the rings inside of the mower.Mower kept stalling when it was being pushed
5,Does the job you need it to,"The assembly for this was very quick. There are little butterfly ends that make tightening on the screws very easy.The blades come adjusted so that they're at a perfect cutting height. So, once assembled you can head out right away and just cut what you need. Depending on your preference, you will need to adjust the height at which you want the grass cut. I left everything as is and got good results.My brother broke my last lawnmower, so I had to get this as a last resort since I'm cash strapped. I had really long grass but after a couple of runs over it with this machine it was nice and short. Just be sure your lawn is even. Reel mowers don't do well on uneven terrain - which made me break a sweat because mine is apparently very uneven.Hope this helps"
4,needs better handle covers,"This is the only thing keeping it from being a 5-star rating. It's a great push mower and as has been mentioned, works great on everything except tall weeds. The foam handlebar covers are okay, but they look like they'll wear out. they're also a bit slippery after your hands start to sweat. I got some bicycle tape instead and it works even better. All that being said, it's a great mower and I can even cut the grass early in the morning or after the sun's gone down and won't upset any neighbors."
5,I LoVe This Lawn Mower!!,I had no idea that I would like this mower as much as I do. It is a JOY to push!! It is smooth and does an excellent job. (Really tall grass has to be weed wacked first.) Nothing like the push mower I used as a kid in the 50's.
5,tThat is some good language!,"That smells like some mighty fine Chomsky.Everyone should go to MIT to learn how to make gadgets for Batman.Chomsky hangs out with those people.He knows about gadgets too, man."
5,I LOVE these books!,"I still own these books and can't stand the thought of parting with them. My parents bought them (I'm guessing) along with a set of encyclopedias when I was young. I was born in 1952; these were published in 1953. As a child I read them over and over and over again. As I grew older, different volumes became my favorites, so the set ""grew"" along with me. I didn't have the books when my own kids were young--they were at my parents' home. Now they are with me once again. Books have changed through the years. I hope not so much that my grandchildren cannot enjoy them the way that I did."
5,UPSY DAISY.,"this is what rock n roll should sound like. hip-shakin, gasoline sweatin, blood lettin grooviness. channeling the voodoo engergy of the carter family, the delta blues, rockabilly, the stooges, and james brown; bringing the love in the middle of the firefight and then kicking everyone in the county's teeth in.fans should also check the hair police, xiu-xiu, the pop group, albert ayler, mississippi fred mcdowell, t. rex, and arthur doyle."
3,"abrasive, not that there's anything wrong with that","Anti 80's pop, nasty sounding, find out who your friends arerock n roll. My favourite songs are Dead Joe (a classic), PowPow Pow and The Dim Locator. Comparing The Birthday Party toMidnight Oil is like comparing The Eagles to The Fugs. Not allAmerican Bands sound the same, ditto in Oz. (I think Midnight Oil are great by the way) This record is a bitof a time capsule for me, having bought it on vinyl when it wasnew. Different to Nick Cave's later stuff, but you don't need meto tell you that. Junk sculpture turning back to junk junk junkjunk junk unk unk ughh ughh ohh ohh ohh Deaaadddd Joe...etc...As some Aussies might say ""It's a pearler""."
1,OVERATED STRUGGLEFEST...,"As with countless others, I'm a fan of Nick Cave..and I can remember hearing of his former band some years back in college.But I couldn't remember what I thought of them. Should have beena hint since I didn't own any Birthday Party albums. Now I remember after purchasing this mess. This ain't no Poison Iveyand it sure ain't Jeffrey Lee either. That's all I could comeup with for comparison. Listen to Radio Birdman or the Australian 'x' for down under muzack. Hell, Midnight Oil is better.Sorry, this disc is just way overrated."
5,"There are progressive bands, and then there is Frumpy","Let's make that opening statement a bit clearer. There are bands out there who get together, get in a studio, and knock out some mediocre albums, be they from today or yesterday, and then there are bands whose musical chemistry is so strong that you wonder where one member ends and another begins. Frumpy, led by singer Inga Rumpf, the Janis Joplin of the European scene, is one of these bands. There is nothing flashy or exciting about any of the singular members, but the great contribution they make is as a unit, not as individuals. Every musician in the group seems to know what and when to play in order to add fullness or harmonic balance to a song, and it shows. A masterpiece."
5,Great writing,"All of the stories are all different, but all linked perfectly. I can't wait to read the next volume and set."
3,"Good concept, but . . . .","Alan Moore's introduction promises more than this collection delivers. However, there's enough here to suggest the series will develop and it would be premature to dismiss ""Planetary"" entirely on the basis on this one book. These first six issues (collected) establish the formula for the series, but neglect to develop the three main characters. Try ""Planetary"" only after you've exhausted Moore's own work."
2,Too Short,"As good as the story is, the price is much too high for only 160 pages.I'm amazed that short stories command such a high price, when you put them together, your paying $40-60 for a decent sized novel."
3,"Amibitious, yet underdeveloped","I'm a fan of Warren Ellis' Transmetropolitan series, so I thought I'd try out Planetary, based on some strong recommendations. The art and the plot are relatively strong: expansive and wildly imaginative. What seems to have been forgotten was character development. With the exception of the enigmatic Elijah Snow, the other two main characters are bland stick figures. I was unable to identify and uninterested in them. Because of this, Planetary comes off as somewhat pedestrian. I'm sure the character development progressed over the course of the series, but this book by itself just isn't all that intriguing. I suggest you try Transmetropolitan if you're looking for someting a bit more innovative."
5,Great Read Especially for the older comic book fans.,"Did you ever read comics back in the 80's? The larger than life stories... the classic Hulk, Doc Savage, alternate worlds, monsters and aliens?Then you will truly appreciate and love this trade. Boy, did Ellis and Cassaday bring back memories. And yet with a fresh spin.It is one of those few trades you can read over and over again as it has quite a number of subtleties in the art and dialogue that you do not notice in story the first few times around."
1,Please No more Biggie,"""Nasty girl"" is just ""Nasty Boy"" The Remix or Part 2. Biggie's verse is th same first verse from ""Nasty Boy"". Then The others on this recorded new material and a new name and new instrumental was given and it was passed off as a new song. That is not right. It seems that Biggie has no unreleased material left and Puffy/Diddy still wants to make money off of him but Isn't he already? Doesn't Puffy/Diddy still make money off of sales from ""Ready to die"", ""Life after death"" and ""Born again""? and What about his ""Press play"" and ""No way out"". It seems to me that Puffy/Diddy will do anything with Bibbie to make money. This song suck and so does the Whole ""Biggie Duets"" Album. Puffy/Diddy needs to just let Biggie RIP"
3,Not as useful as I'd hoped,"It turns out to be as much user manual for a validation tool, which is ok. I'd been hoping to use it to check a complicated protocol for a product I was building, but couldn't make any progress in a month. Partly this is my own inadequacy, partly its a problem of applying formal methods to real-world cases, and partly its a problem of examples that are too simple (reflecting the problems of formal methods).On the other hand, the description of race conditions in the introductory material is lucid, and if you haven't designed in and debugged a few of those, you might find it valuble. A bit pricey for that, though."
2,just an okay workout,"This pilates abs video is not really worth getting if you already have a regular pilates workout dvd, it's about all the same exercises as a regular pilates dvd."
1,I do not like this workout!!!,"I workout everyday. I thought I would add some new workouts to my collection. This was one I bought. I can't tell you how much I hate it. I'm in great shape, but am naturally inflexible. I can't do a lot of this or they hurt my back. I am sooooo dissappointed. I guess pilates is not for me. So SAD :("
3,"Good, but kind of boring, for me anyway...","My title says it all. Ana knows her moves and teaches well, but personally, I find her style not particularly inspiring. But that's just me. Still, it's a good DVD to get results and you can always play your own music in the background if you want and still see proper form and good pilates positions. Oh! and she's not annoying, that's a very big deal with exercise DVD's! :)"
5,Intermediate/Advanced,I so enjoy this dvd. I have really strong abs and am always looking for a challenge. I still incorporate Beachbody's Ab Ripper X and Cathe's core. I love how this workout gets more difficult as you master the form. I've gotten more than my moneys worth from it!
3,was hoping for more...,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good DVD and I consider myself in pretty good shape having done Pilates for many years. She moves quickly throughout the DVD with little rest (which I love). Her voice gets slightly annoying, could do with a little less coaching. I was disappointed was that this was only a 35 minute (in reality it is only 20 minutes of workout- the other 15 minutes is fluff)- only ONE workout. I wish there were at least two or three 20 minute workouts to mix things up a bit. If I would have known this (or paid better attention to the reviews/description) I might not have purchased. Oh well- it will suffice, just wish there was a bit more!"
4,Really challenging,"I started doing Pilates about 2 months ago, and I love it. I began with Ana Caban's Pilates Quick Start for weight loss. I really liked it, and so I decided to try her Pilates for Abs. It was very challenging! It was definitely harder than the Quick Start for Weight Loss, and it is not for the faint of heart. She does many traditional pilates abs workouts, but adds a twist. She does the harder version, and her assistant, Tara, does the easy version.Also, beware of the ""once more"". Ana will say ""Once more"" and she does not mean one more. There may be 2 more sets after she says that. Other than that, I like this video a lot. This is why I gave it 4 stars.It is kinda short, 26 minutes or so. There is only one workout on the DVD. The Quick start video has a 30 minute work out and a 20 minute workout, and a work out CD, so you get more for your money with that one."
4,Get the combo DVD,"Great workout, but you can get this on one DVD with a Rodney Yee Yoga for abs segment and a Patricia Waldron balance ball for abs segment. All are worth having, so you might as well get them for the price of one."
3,FIne... nothing like the real thing,I need to go to class for real.. this works but just doesnt do as well as in person class
3,Very advanced Pilates ABS,The description of this DVD does not explain the level of advancement or age necessary to perform the excercise. If you are older or a beginner you could get seriously hurt doing these excercises. I saw absolutely no warm up or cool down at all. I would love to find a modified version of these excercises for beginners. But if you are older and just starting AB excecises I urge you to stay away from this one.
3,Definite it's not,"Especially Funkadelic's later work for Warner is being recycled over & over, often under the banner definite. It's important to realize that they mean the definite Warner recordings; none of their Westbound material is represented here. Where as you could claim to have a pretty much definite Funkadelic collection if you've got all their Westbound material, this hardly could be said of their Warner releases.Funkadelic did much of their groundbreaking work on Westbound and cashed in at Warner, at least for a while. Their span at Warner was also when Funkadelic went belly-up. This had much to do with the fact Funkadelic wasn't a real band anymore by the time they left Westbound. It was more just one of the projects of P-Funk mastermind George Clinton, who used Funkadelic for his more rock oriented material. By this point in his career drugs became growingly more important, music slowly became second. The Warner years essentially chronicle the slow but steady decline of Funkadelic."
4,Raw classic funk,"It doesn't get better than the Clinton P-Funk empire. Each song funkier and qurikier than the next. My personal favorites includes ""(Not Just) Knee Deep"", ""Oh, I"", ""Electro-Cuties"", ""Cholly"", and of course, the band's perennial song ""One Nation Under A Groove"". This label, Union Square Music, has a lot of great music and I'm going to order some more from this label."
4,Funk at it's best....,This cd is one of the best collection of funk. If you like and enjoy funk from the past. This is for your collection. They are funk masters at their best. Get yours.
2,much needed english book -- but disappointing,"An OK book for those just beginning to play; but if you're looking for any kind of in-depth analysis, you're out of luck here. Half the book consists of categorizing openings by Red's first move -- and that's all, no response moves, no follow-ups or variations, nothing. Very thin. The second half is a collection of 24 games with some commentary, which is better, but the games themselves are sometimes of questionable quality. For what it is (113 pp. from title page to the end), it really ought to cost half this much."
4,Well (and simply) written,"Great for people who have never studied Scripture before.One drawback for me though was that this author does not speak American-English because he's from Britain. That being said there were some terms, etc., that were used which were difficult to follow/understand at times. All in all though, an enjoyable read."
4,Great pastoral aid,"N.T. Wright is one of my favorite commentators. I have this on kindle, As a pastor I am finding that kindle books make excellent sources without carrying a large volume of material from place to place."
3,Easy to understand but not theologically deep,This is a good commentary for someone looking for an easy to understand look at 1 Corinthians. N.T. Wright does a good job focusing on various themes within the chapters themselves and the overall theme of Paul writing to the Corinthians. If you are looking for an in-depth analysis of 1 Corinthians this is not the commentary for you.
5,Bad Boys with Red Roses,"No other details needed when I looked up this book to bye Amazon gave a short summary of the book and different conditions, and prices,and places to bye from my choices to make."
3,Bad Boys With Roses,"Having been a big fan of the ""bad boys"" books in the past, I found myself slightly disappointed with this particular edition. Two of the three stories didn't live up to their predecessors in the other ""Bad Boys"" books."
5,Great anthology,"""Still Mr. & Mrs"" by. Janelle Denison. At a casino in Las Vegas, Luke wins the bet of a lifetime that leads to Rachel Hudson being in his bed. His plan is no more regrets of what could have been as he wants to make her his sure bet.""Tempt Me, Tease Me, Thrill Me"" by Tina Donahue. The greatest night of his life occurred when Chicago police officer Sean Logan made love with Judge Cait Campbell. He wants her honor to agree to a lifetime sentence, but may have to arrest her to get her to confess her guilty desires for him.""The Invitation"" by Sharon Cullars. The single long stem rose arrives with an unsigned invitation. Next comes the sexy phone call by a man who oozes seduction as he invites Gerri to meet him for a rendezvous that he vows will satiate both of their most coveted fantasies.Harriet Klausner"
4,Bjork -- What's not to love...,"Wonderful. If you do not have, or never heard this, get it now! Possibly one of Bjork's best songs (if you can even choose!) Bjork's lyrics and ability to remix one song seven times and make it sound like seven different songs is amazing. She truly is phenomenal!"
1,"Typical V-Tech, BROKEN!","We've been burned by V-Tech and their inferior products twice before. The V-Smile system only worked for a few months; the V-Pocket worked for exactly 13 days. So, I suppose this is pretty much our fault for buying our 7 year old what he REALLY wanted for his birthday.Imagine my complete lack of surprise when I pulled this system out of the box on his birthday and it didn't work at all. We've tried all of the ""Troubleshooting Tips"" three times and tried various outlets in the house. The thing does not work. When we called V-Tech about the issue, we were told that since we bought the unit 3.5 months ago (when it was on a great sale), it is not their problem. Lovely customer service.Save your money and always buy LEAP FROG! We've never had a single problem (read: heartbroken child) over Leap Frog products."
4,Still Enjoys It,"Bought this for my youngest daughter when she was 7, she's 9 now and still enjoys playing with it. Sadly it's hard to find games for it now. If you can still find one with games, I would recommend snatching it up."
1,Fire hazard,I bought this for a boy I sit for. It was xmas and he was so excited to play with his first race track. The track was easy to put together but the stand that the track rested on would not sit even on the floor. The blue car would not move so the yellow car raced itself. And the worst part of the track was that one of the controls started smoking 2minutes after playing with it and would not stop. The track was returned to the store the next day! I was so upset and embarrassed.This toy was a major disapointment. Hot wheel toys are not made like they used to.
1,Junk,"My 6 year old son received this for his birthday and it worked for about 20 minutes--after that, it was hit or miss. One car would work then stop, the other car would work then stop, etc. I finally dismantled it and tossed it in the garbage when he was sleeping. I got tired of hearing ""mom, could you fix it"" every 5 minutes."
3,fun facts are only novel for the first few essays.,"this book shows a great deal of attention to the flubbs in hollywood, but in some cases, the information is too much. for instance, it is great to know where Patton was shot and where all of the equipment came from, but the essay lacks a clear thesis. for an academic text, i am disappointed."
4,great for little ones.,"My granddaughter received this for Christmas. She and my other four grandchildren loved it. It's easy to set up, seems durable, and it folds away for storage."
3,better for a 2 year old,I bought this for my 3 year old. It's pretty flimsy & keeps collapsing. Probably best for a 1-3yr range but maybe(hopefully) it will be more fun as we play with it more.
4,Lots of fun!!!,"I bought this as a present for my 3 year old nephew, but I think his parents loved it more than him. He enjoys throwing the ball to fit into the hole, just like a pitcher, but the game option of rolling the ball to get some points got the adults playing even more than the kid. Great game, has resisted the pulls and pushes as well as storing. Recommended for kids that like sports or throwing :) and parents that enjoy playing with their kids. I know I liked it, it was realy fun."
4,Pop-up ball arcade,"I have a 3-yr old and a 1 1/2-yr old. They like to play with this toy but its not on the list of favorites. I thought there would be a little more to the toy than there actually is with it being advertised as a 3-in-1, but my kids are fine with just throwing the balls in and trying to get them through different holes for a while. Sometimes the boys get frustrated that the balls wont/can't go through the small flaps covering the various openings, they may be too stiff for the light, plastic balls to push past. Folding it up into a circle to fit into the mesh bag was a problem but has become easier over time."
2,A little disappointed,The 2 children I care for got excited about this toy for about 5 minutes. For some reason it was lopsided right out of the box. It gets no attention in the playroom except when the toddler I work with wants to sit in it.Have a wonderful day.
3,Cheap,"I have a 5G Video iPod and I had problems getting this dock to work. Windows would recognize there was a new device, but would come back as device unknown and it wouldn't launch iTunes. I purchased a 6' Male-A to Male-A USB cable separately, then it started working for me, so I suspect the USB cable that came with the dock was the problem."
1,"Poor product, waste of money",Could not get this to work. PC and laptop did not recognize the IPOD. Took it to work and PC at work was successful but only for awhile and then the same thing happened. It did not recognize the IPOD. The IPOD gave message not to disconnect but I-Tunes (I call this Looney Tunes) did not recognize that the IPOD was connected and I could not eject it. PC would not let me disconnect. I had unplug and let the battery run out so it could reset.
3,These pants are too tight!,"I bought this outfit for one of our Groovy Girls dolls and the pants are a smidge too tight. I kept imagining the poor doll thinking she had to go on a diet! The velcro closure is strong, so I mushed her in there, but really."
2,Plodding.......Within is Without allure,"The movie is about a girl who has the ability to see the evil side of the person (they half-heartedly appear like those in Sixth Sense). After her mother is murdered, the girl and her father move from their apartment from L.A. to a house in a quaint size town. From there there the plot starts. She ends up making a mischievous friend and befriends her elementary teacher. She then begins to see a dead girl appear every once in a while and the mystery ensues.I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. At the very least I was hoping for a small amount of build up or a bit of creepiness. Both were lacking. The suspense and climax is thin in this movie. The story line is semi-obvious along w/ the prime suspect (villain). I will rate this as a back-shelved Lifetime Network suspense movie.pjt."
2,Dreadful movie about people I dont care about,"The movie never developed a ""feeling"" for the characters, wasnt very scary, wasnt a well made movie in any manner and is so forgetable I had to click on it to remember the basic plotline....what little there was of it.I dont recommend this movie......at all"
1,within,Didn't play good at all and couldn't watch the movie so I was disappointed with the viewing would like a refund in my account to view another movie
1,THIS BOOK IS THE PITTS,"This book is by far one of the worst collegiate books I have had to buy for a class. It is vague, and it gives about the worst examples ever. You would think that for the amount of Money you have to shell out the book it would be the best thing on the planet, but it's not. West Publishing Company should look to publish a supplement with this book as the formats on all the documents I had to prepare for my civil litigation class taken from this book were wrong. Nothing I did for class that came out of this book was correct so I had to wind up using the internet for most of my research. BUYER BEWARE! THIS BOOK ABSOLUTELY SUCKS AND IS NOT WORTH THE $120 YOU HAVE TO SHELL OUT FOR A NEW COPY. SO IF YOU HAVE TO USE THIS BOOK FOR CLASS GET IT CHEAP OR YOU'LL BE SADLY DISAPPOINTED."
4,Great to have mixable media for travel.,"A recent review I read in PC Magazine where they felt the ATRACformat was noisy, not the case. A disk I started (using ATRAC) sounds roughly as good as some disks I dubbed using an MD deck some time earlier. Hence my decision to go with this technology as opposed to the FLASH RAM or hard drive based devices since I already had an MD library. It sounds pretty good, not great as it is a portable device and my ears are pretty good for such things. I hope it lasts a while because looks like Sony is getting ready to bail on the MD format and I don't want return to make any more Sony electronics (non-media) purchases. Don't get me started on the rootkit nonsense because I believe the music execs all deserve jail for creating a new conduit for spyware."
2,Good Product,"This is a good product. Not as good as an MP3 player with internal memory, as it is bulkier. But, it is great for the price. The only drawback is, it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory. Running with it can be uncomfortable at times...if you are a runner, you may prefer a smaller mp3 player, one you can put in your shorts pocket...."
2,Defective walkman,"The sony minidisc walkman that we received was defective. It did not function in the ""shuffle"" mode. However, we did appreciate being able to return the item for a refund."
2,unhappy,"We were unhappy with this product. We have a asortment of mini disk and we thought we could play them on this player, but it has its own mini tape that it only plays. You have to record on it and can ONLY play what you recorded on it."
2,"""We are twins with different genders stupid""","This movie was a MAJOR disappointment for me. The story has Sammo Hung and Wu Jing trying to retrieve the Heaven's Bead. The Heaven's Bead supposedly can cure cancer. The rest of the story isn't worth going over. Everybody in this movie has a twin and that got old fast. This is just about as sloppy as Hong Kong movies come. It took me 3 different viewings to finally finish it.The action is decent at times, but none of the fights stood out to me. The opening fight is probably the best. Wu Jing looks great, but Sammo and Yuen Wah are wasted. Most of the action involves unrealistic wirework and the only actor who really gets to show off is Wu Jing.1.5/5"
5,One of the best book ever,"Love the story the way Linda Nichols brings Gods words to life can not wait for another. Loved it.,I can ready it again."
2,"Had a dark, depressed feeling","While reading this book I had a dark, semi-depressed feeling. It may not be my type of book. The outcome was good and the main character did find her way out of the world of drugs and into forgiveness from God."
4,"Not a Sparrow, NO not one.........",Enjoyed this so much! Redemption at last... Bridie is the ultimate in needing redemption and Alastair looking for healing was a great combination.
4,Nice,Thank you for your continued prompt and speedy service which I very much appreciate and the reason I continue to order from Amazon.
5,Thought Provoking...,I downloaded Not a Sparrow Falls because it was free but was rewarded with a touching and heartwarming story of second chances. It evoked thoughts of struggles that we all must face and the hope for redemption and our happy ever after...An excellent read.
4,"Great story, but lots of drug content","This book tells the tale of a young woman with a very troubled past. She was involved with the manufacturing of drugs and lived a life of crime. She manages an escape, assumes a new identity and tries to turn her life around. The young woman known as ""Bridie"" accepts a position as a nanny to a pastor's family who is troubled by his own past. The two must come to terms with who they've become...healing and love occur in the process.I really enjoyed this book and became attached to the characters. Towards the end, I couldn't put the book down. Quite a bit of suspense and a great read! A word of caution to parents of teenagers who read Christian fiction: there is a lot of drug content in this book."
5,Great read,"I downloaded this one for free one day, and read it in a day. Great characters, the writing is great! I want to look for more from this author!"
3,somewhat predictable ending and rough in places,"It takes a lot of courage to try and change your life if you see no way out. The book focuses on Mary Bridget, who has made some bad choices and is living with the consequences. She believes that God does not see her. So many people think this at some time in their lives. Mary Bridget finds an opportunity to escape and begin a new life. But the past won't stay in the past. Will it change her new relationships? Is there such a thing as unconditional love? Can she be an instrument of healing someone else's life?There were a few places in the novel that I felt lost and couldn't place why a particular event or scene was included, but Nichols ties it all together in the end with a somewhat predictable and sweet ending. Definitely a book with themes of redemption, forgiveness and grace, both in the eyes of our Heavenly Father and fellow men."
5,great characters,"i fell in love w/ the characters in this book! great story about how people can change and giving people a chance. it really makes you think about people you might see every day and wonder why they make the choices they make. i usually do not like fiction, but i gave this one a try thanks to bethany house who sent it to me free in exchange for agreeing to review the book."
4,Real life in novel form,"Taking on a new identity to hide her past Mary Bridget throws her self out of her former life and into a totally new one. How can she adjust to this shocking change?Who will find out about her past? How will that change the new life she's trying to live? Will anyone believe her?This book is filled with passion, energy and emotion. Mary's life change helps save a poor overwrought and grieving family. Will this be enough or is she looking for more?This book is encouraging to read as so many of us make careless mistakes and have to live with the consequences. What would we do if we were forced to make a drastic change?God's grace is applied over and over again throughout the pages of this book.A great book for those who might be walking on rocky ground."
5,Outstanding !!!!!!!,This is the first novel I have read by Linda Nichols.....I plan on reading all of them now. This story captured my heart from the first chapter. I felt for all of the characters in the book and it left me with a warm heart when I finished. Do yourself a favor -- read it and ENJOY !!!!!!
1,"If depressed, don't read this book!","I did not like this book at all. I thought everything was far fetched. I can't imagine real people living like this. It certainly did not inspire my faith one iota. I read it for book club and most of the women in the group enjoyed the book, but felt the situations were all a little contrived. No other reviewer has mentioned the fact that the mother kills herself in the book. How can that make it a great book? Of course that part of the book was very realistic. I must be honest and say that I was very depressed after losing my mother very suddenly, so I read the book with a heavy heart. I loved Ms. Nichols book ""At the Scent of Water"" and have sent my copy to friends out of state. Therefore, I know she is a great writer. This one just didn't do it for me."
4,GOOD read,"I really enjoyed the twist and turns of this book. I was really pulled into all the characters, even the little twins. My heart ached for them. Great story."
4,A very good read,"It was very good, slow to get started but great as ou continued to read. I would recommend it very much."
3,"Good read, many errors","Good read but A LOT of spelling, wording errors! Spell check DOES NOT catch everything. Always read it after spellcheck is used. Just kinda off-putting."
5,"Uncertain at first, but glad I kept reading",The prologue at first seemed unconnected from the story (but wasn't). I was uncertain if I could cope with the life of the girl in the story. The author held my interest and I soon was involved with the other characters. Tied up nicely and neatly. Good read.
4,Refreshingly different.,"I'm not a big romance reader. But this book caught my eye and something told me to give it a chance.I'm glad I did. It truly was a memorable story. The most striking part of it all to me was the starkly poignant way the author tackled the issue of human-reliance. She showed how dangerous it is to rely on a mere person for your happiness. People always fail people. We were made to love each other, not to hang on each other. No one is strong enough to carry both their issues and your issues on their shoulders, no matter how sure they may be of the otherwise.Yup... a pretty neat story... and a potentially life-saving lesson."
4,Good Contemporary Christian Fiction Book,"I thought this was a sweet, touching story overall. It is a contemporary Christian fiction book. The characters and plot were interesting and unique. I really felt for all of them. The writing was good and drew me in from the beginning. Some parts were beautiful. The ending was fitting and I liked it. The main theme is forgiveness. Recommended.Review copy provided by publisher."
4,Not a Sparrow Falls,"Written in 2002, Not a Sparrow Falls was a 2003 Christy Awards finalist in the Contemporary category. Nichols handles difficult topics to write about within Christian fiction with grace and confidence. The message of redemption through Christ is seen in the pages of the book."
2,It was ok,"The story starts out strong, The old lady praying, then moves to the drug ring and introduces the main character Bridie, but then they lost me. I had a hard time being hooked into this story. It switched view points, which generally like dual views, but it just jumbled this story for me. I did not particularly like the characters of the family- especially Alasdair. I felt like I was suppose to like him or feel bad for him, but I just didn't. A part of me liked Bridie and I really did like the relationship that was formed between her and the kids. But otherwise I was just uninterested. The story was predictable and I wasn't that excited to go back to reading it. There is good symbolism in the story and I felt that it was building up to something great at the end, that simply never came. Good potential, but it never came.I received this book free from Bethany House Publishing."
1,Not falling for it',"There is no way I could get through this book , the first 3 chapters including the prologue skip around like someone with poison ivy. Generally it's easier to start the story with the main character then bring in other characters to cross that story. I was just exhausted weighing through everything else to see where the characters would meet . Good luck."
2,Too much religion,Pretty predictable. It was free; you get what you pay for. Why do I need to say more?....more ?.....more? more?
5,Wonderful,"I highly recommend this book, it is a wonderful story of redemption and a sweet love story. Must reading for all lovers of Christian fiction."
5,Bedding for Grandson,I purchased this Moon Bear bedding set for my grandson's crib for our home. The price was very reasonable and the quality is excellent. I recommend it highly.
1,Many happy returns,"I purchased this tv NEW and got it home and it had a chip in the glass. So I called and got it replaced and when I got the second one home and out of the box, it had a green tint to everything on the left half of the screen. I would not recommend this to anyone. I am returning the second one tomorrow. Good luck if you purchase this tv to not get one that is damaged."
2,Don't Care for this at all,"It smells like Happy By Clinque but with a more earthy smell to it. This is not for me and I would not ever buy another bottle. But on a good note, I love 360 Pink, IT IS MY FAVORITE. So not all the Perry Ellis's are on my Hit List."
3,It okay,Not what I expected - but the smell is bearable - wouldnt buy another one though - and wouldnt recommend it to anyone
1,This 3 disc set will make a nice set of 3 colorful coasters!,"I am a devoted Metheny fan, but his credibility as a musician is jeopardized by this horrific titanic of self-indulgence. I was unable to find even 1 song that was remotely pleasant to listen to. It was an impulse buy, as every Metheny disc I've purchased. I wish I'd read the reviews first! If Metheny and his pals are interested in recording ""avant-garde"" noise, then my suggestion is... hit the studio, pay for it yourself and save it for posterity. However, please, don't pass the expense on to your fans and supporters. I'm just glad I need some colorful drink coasters at home!"
4,it's not THAT bad ....,"despite the less than fantastic reviews, the sign of 4 is, in my opinion, not that bad. i am a metheny fan and think his other stuff is marvelous. going in, it is important to remember what style of music sign of 4 is meant to be. this is not supposed to be rehearsed, studio music. it is meant to be random, come what will fusion of various instruments and noise-makers. with this in mind, i feel this triple cd album hits the mark (esp. the second cd). if for no other reason, you have to like this album because of its cool homage to sherlock holmes...=)"
1,Absolutely horrible,"This is NOT the Pat Metheny we all know and love. This music(?) is pure screeching, as Pat would once in a blue moon do in concert. Pat and company are the best in jazz. Their 'usual' music is simply the best in the business. Stick to the Letter from Home, First Circle, Offramp, The Road to You, etc. CD's. Only buy this if you are doing so to complete your collection of Pat's work."
1,garbage,"Don't confuse this CD with actual music. Sounds like several musicians warming up like they are getting ready to play something, but never do. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to appreciate this CD, but I doubt it. Save your money and by some real music. Nice packaging though."
5,Growing in Grace age 13,It completely met my expectations. I was very satisfied with the service from the sending company. The product was beautiful.
3,good book,TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC CARDINAL GREAT LIFE STORY LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION. I WOULD GLADLY READ IT AGAIN AS SOON AS POSABLE
5,Great book!,"This book is great, but don't buy anything from Amazon. Your local bookstore can order this book in just a couple of days and you will help keep the small guy in business. Make a vow to yourself not to be lazy!"
5,Concerned Parents Must Read!,Keeping Kids Safe is a book every parent should read. It teaches the very basics of child safety from teaching your child how to use a pay phone when they don't have money to teaching your children safety methods that instill the self confidence they need so they don't become victims. Child safety is an important issue in society today. This is an easy to use guide that every parent should take the time to read.
3,"Watered down, funk-fusion. Nice busy background music.","I had high hopes. I always do. I don't have any other albums by anybody in the band, so I had nothing to compare it to. The band members all hold their own very nicely. There are some very good fusion tunes on here, but nothing very memorable. I was waiting for someone to just start tearing up the place, and it did happen in a few spots for a brief time, but not as often as I had hoped. I agree with the previous review concerning their live show. I bet they would be hot hot hot live. It seems like they were held back a bit in the studio, and live, they could potentially give Niacin a run for their money. But, if you're looking for the b-3 groove, and you want your booty to move, pick up Niacin, High Bias. You can't go wrong with Dennis Chambers."
5,great value,I bought this sugar thinking it was natural rock sugar but it is much smaller but tastes very good.Doesn't oversweeten like sugar and looks much better to serve.
2,HE'S THAWING FAST,"Miles is frozen and brought back to life 10 years later. He is cold and heartless. His own dog barks at him. Why? Because dogs are known to be ""soul detectors."" They can sniff out if a person has a soul or not. Apparently when you die and come back, your soul opts not to make the return trip. Having been frozen and thawed many times (first time was by accident) I can tell you that is not the case, although it is not good for the arthritis.For some reason people without souls are stereotyped into the category of people with souls who behave badly, i.e. Peeping Toms have no soul.The transfer quality of the film is very bad. Seriously, is this the best copy they had lying around? Even if it was a good copy, the film doesn't translate well into the 21st century. Pretty much a waste of time to watch it.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
5,This stuff is the stuff!,"I'm somewhat new to caulking but needed to weather-proof a 100 year old craftsman after our first winter in it proved a little on the chilly side. I got the hang of it after about 1 tube of this stuff and was doing straight, neat lines on the outside frames of our basement windows.We'll see how it stands up. I figure if it saves us even 5% on the utility bills we saw last year it will be well worth it."
2,Expected it to be better...,"This was one of the hardest books for me to finish. The characters are not likable and I really did not care to find out what happened to any of them in the end. Some of the plots seemed thrown in and made little use of once they were presented.For a book that is supposed to bring ""Sex and the City"" and Jane Austen together, it did not even attempt to do it. I love both ""SATC"" and Jane Austen's writings but this book should not even be compared to either one.It is not the worst book I have ever read but I would not recommend this to other readers. If you want anything dealing with Jane Austen, stick to her books or try some of the other ""inspired by Jane"" novels."
1,Dreadful book,"With all due respect, I must differ from the excellent reviews given to this book on this site. To me, it is a badly written attempt to cash in on the current popularity of Jane Austen, with whom this book has almost nothing to do. Instead of characters, it features caricatures working their way through one of the silliest plots I have encountered. The narrator, supposedly a smart and talented film review writer, uses language that is alternately cutesy and lewd, and makes Bridget Jones, whose stories this book obviously imitates, seem like a genius. In all, I felt as if I were reading a comic book without pictures. Read the Bridget Jones books instead, or try The Jane Austen Book Club, which is a masterpiece in comparison to Sex and Sensibility."
4,Cute story,"This is a story of Lizzie she is a modern girl who like all girls she is looking for love.This book is alittle Sex in the City, Bridget Jones all wrapped up in a Jane Austen flavor.The book is fun and a fast book to read. I thoroughly enjoyed."
1,Vereee bad!!!!!!,"Ugh....I never write Amazon reviews, but this book truly deserves a bad one. I can't believe other ppl gave it such great reviews. The characters are shallow and moronic to say the very least, Lizzy being one of the worst characters in the piece, and unfortunately the protagonist. And I totally agree the use of ""vereee"" constantly got on my nerves, and so did all the brit slang used by these ""Americans"" (???). I did not like one character in this book! What a disappointment...I was looking fwd to a nice fun read."
4,a fast happy read,"If you are a lover of Jane Austen you might wonder how you could live in today's world and still adhere to the values expressed in her novels. This is what Rosemarie Santini does so successfully in this enchanting book.A bright accomplished young career woman perplexed by the complexities of her life looks back to the Austen heroines for a path to follow. Funny and fast moving, this is a book for a happy read that you will long remember."
1,A do not buy item,I'll keep it short. The navigation on my nextel phone is more accurate and easier to find address.Also it crashed lost of times requiring a reboot.
1,Pathetic,My order has NOW been postponed twice. The company that is shipping Needs to send it overnight! I am very dissatisfied at this time! I purchased a 2 year warranty for this item that started almost a month ago!
3,AVIC-S1,"Negatives:- Very poor routing software. Takes you off the freeway onto local roads when the freeway would be much, much faster. Doesn't matter whether you have 'fastest route' or 'shortest route' selected.- No turn list. I'd like to be able to preview all of the turns on my route BEFORE I start navigating to that route.- Postition updating is slow and, at least on my unit, inaccurate by tens of feet. I'll pass an intersection and the unit's display shows I haven't even gotten to it yet.Positives:- Price - I paid only $280 shipped- Small size, good mounting to the windshield.- Accurate mapsIf I were to buy again, I'd try a different brand as the routing algorithm is a show-stopper for me. I'm comparing this to my built-in Nav system in my Lexus LS430 and the Lexus blows the doors off this unit in all areas. 'Course it's much more expensive."
4,Avic-s1,Nice little package. I like the hands free Bluetooth feature. I also would like to have seen phone numbers with POI's.
4,Still one of the great options theory books.,"I bought this book 7 years ago, and just recently took it back off the shelf to read/reread sections related to my current work. Book is packed with explanations that facilitate understanding of these complex instruments. And it's nice to see how the binomial model is developed by its inventors. I highly recommend this book to all seeking to understand how to price and analyse options. The reason I gave it 4 stars was that book has an equities focus."
5,A good read of course--it's a Chicken Soup Book!!,"The first book I received had sixty pages in it UPSIDE DOWN! lol. I contacted Amazon and found their return policy to be fantastic and easy!The second book was formatted normally and I read it in two days! I enjoyed the stories and I always read the bio's on the author at the back of the book. That is where ""the rest of the story"" truly resides.Quite a bit of humor in this book. Hope they come out with a second version."
2,"Good content, poor interface","I have a lot of Bible and related software, I mean a lot! I am very studied and am a computer nut, so I am in a good position to review this software.I bought it, because it was the least expensive source I could find for for certain documents in it, but I the interface is not natural or friendly, hardly a joy to use. If this was my only software, it might be o.k. as I would have spent enough hours on it to be used to how it operates, and memorizes commands and procedures.If you have no need to be efficient, this might beo.k., but it would not be my first choice, by any means. I have 5 Bible suites, and in my experience, you get what you pay for. I did not pay much for this."
3,not 4 windows 7,"This is a great study tool if you don't have windows 7. with xp it's great easy to use & easy to select bibles, books, or chapters. I tried to get info. from customer support but have not recieved help yet. I would reccommend this product over some others I have tried because it is so user friendly, if you don't have windows7."
2,I wish there had been more info provided on this product,"This product is actually a newer generation of one that I already had. But, I don't remember reading that this productwasn't going to work well with my Vista 64-bit PC. So, instead of being able to install it where I needed it, I had togo install it over my older version on my old laptop with XP and 34 bit. I'd like to say I am able to utilize all the allegedbells and whistles, but I don't think I can. However, in it's defense, it does give me a different selection of font sizeswhich are nice to change when 'editing' Christian literature and having to look up verses. So, I have limited happiness aboutthe product since I still don't have a version for my PC. The product did come 'pristine' in unopened cellophane wrapper. And, was sent very quickly. No complaints there."
2,I don't lke it,"I choose this rate because I had expected better performance from Don Byron in this album ""I don't like it"""
3,Worth the money,"the cut isn't the most sylish on the polo, but the shirt does it's job. It's very durable, it has withstood washes from the brutal KBR staff here on post. It's not something I'd rock at home, but as far as deployed gear 5.11 sets the standard.."
1,Don't waste your money,"What a disappointment! I bought this as a gift for someone and what turned up was a cheap, cheesy, lame video. Not at all worth the money. I am following through with Amazon because they probably shouldn't carry it. It is practically a rip-off..."
2,Misleading Title but OK DVD,"The title, ""Modern Rock Guitar Soloing"" is very misleading. The title should be ""Modern Rock Rhythm Guitar"", or ""Modern Rock in Drop D"". There are 11 chapters on this DVD and 9 of them deal with Drop D. I bought the DVD because I thought it would show something about soling in modern rock. Well it doesn't. The only thing it has is a section on octaves and one on unison bends. Other than that it deals with tuning in Drop D, power chords in Drop D, how to play open chords in Drop D, and how to drop the standard tuning down two steps to achieve a heavier sound. If you know how to play Drop D and you want to improve your solo, pass on this and get ""Rock Discipline"" by John Petrucci."
4,SQL*PLUS is a hit with me and my colleagues !,"I'm a newbie, as far as ORACLE is concerned, I have used a similar Database management system - UniVision, which has it's own language (Vision), I found this book an excellent introduction/guide to SQL*PLUS. So much so, that I've recommended it to colleagues and customers who are more experienced than I am - and they all agree with me. Splendid stuff."
4,Good book for a beginner!,"I've been using the book at home with Oracle 8.0.5 for linux and it has been very helpful - I'm an Oracle novice. I would have rated it higher, but the index and/or grouping of some of the concepts is not consistent. For example, one reader noted that the text refers you to chapter 11 to set your default editor - then does not tell you how to do this in chapter 11. As far as I could see, this is true - chapter 11 does not tell you how to do this - but in chapter 4 there is an *example* that shows how to do this (DEFINE _EDITOR = vi). I liked the sections on report and script writing, I thought they were concise yet easy to follow. Overall, I'd recommend the book to another newbie"
3,It didn't solve my problems...,"Having been a user of SQL*Plus for over 10 years I was hoping to find some answers to more advanced topics rather than the basics. The coverage of how SQL*plus scripts are driven from O/S batch or shell scripts is sorely lacking. This is a rich area not effectively covered in any text that I'm aware of. Several areas don't tell the full story - or fail to highlight subtle differences in syntax (e.g. yy vs. rr in date formatting).Having said all that, I still regularly use this book as a reference and continue to learn from it."
4,SQL* Plus should not be confused with SQL,"I had bought this text a few years ago to learn SQL. Little did I know then that SQL Plus is a ""sand box"" that contains SQL. Needless to say that I was disappointed and had to shelf this book.However, after reading an introductory book on SQL and writing lots of code, I revisited this text and found it to be quite useful.In summary, this should not be used by SQL novices. This book teaches ""SQL Plus"" and not SQL per se. Once, you have learnt the language, this book will come handy to1, execute sql queries (by scripting)2, format the report3, set up the development environment4, to discover the database5, and much much moreOne reason for not assigning five stars is the lack of ease when it comes to downloading the sample code and installing it on my machine."
2,Not for First-time Listeners of Spooky or Electronic Music,"Uh, no. A mix-CD of things that Spooky digs, with some remixing here and there. I had to listen to it a few times to find 1 song that I could listen to more than twice. It's not that the music is bad, it's just hard to grasp. Hey, I like the dilalecitcal manuevrings of The Art of Noise, too, but I think I'd know when I'm licked. It's thick, it's spooky and it's a tough listen to get through. A lot of it just comes off as pure noise, and I LIKE Spooky, in general."
3,HARD TO CLEAN,"I purchased this item for my sister, who likes to have barbecue all the times. It is nicely designed. Hard to turn on and lit. Make sure to purchase the carrying deck. If not you have to come up with a solution to keep it elevated. It is much bigger and bulkier than it looks on the picture. Because it is very hard to clean, my sister used it only a couple of times."
1,Absolute CRAP!,This product is junk! They replaced the nice heavy duty cast iron grates that this grill used to come with with this cheap tin crap that warped the 3rd time we used it. Don't buy it!
4,"Good Product, Very Happy","Easy to assemble, cooks well, easy to clean. The lid on mine was a gray color instead of the pictured red, but I preferred that. The only thing that would have made it the perfect portable grill would be the ability to cook with the lid closed."
1,Disposable Grill,"Terrible product. This grill lasted three uses before becoming useless. The build quality is flimsy, the piezo starter stopped functioning after the second session, the propane adapter stripped out quickly, and clean up is difficult. Fat and marinade trap easily at the bottom so flare ups are a problem. There's no lid to deal w/ flare up's which also wastes more propane and makes cooking pretty inefficient. I wouldn't recommend grilling anything but hotdogs on this."
1,"Low-quality, badly designed","Where to begin? The shipment didn't contain the correct hardware for assembly. Assembly was absurdly difficult. The bottom rails didn't fit onto the rest of the chair, and when we finally got one of them together, the chair wouldn't sit properly, wobbled horribly.Really disappointed. Packed them right up and sent them back. Won't purchase for this company again."
3,Parts were laugh out loud funny,Loved most of this book (as it is a book of short stories of the writer's life). She definitely has a great way of telling story AND she sounds like we could be best of friends. She is hysterically funny and REAL. The only bummer is there were a few stories that were a bit depressing. I dropped the book for 2 weeks and didn't pick it back up cuz I was bored with it. I would read other stories of hers though.
4,the south's answer to sedaris,"Susan Reinhardt writes hilarious stories from below the Mason-Dixon line, taking on the most off-the-wall topics with a warmth and razor-sharp wit reminiscent of a cornbread-fed David Sedaris."
4,This is a great book,I liked this book but not as much as her 1st book..It is more heartfelt and I am looking for pure humor
5,If you don't want to read this book...,"...buy it on your Kindle. The only thing funnier than this book, is having the electronic voice on your Kindle read it to you!"
5,Excellent CD by mainstream jazz veterans.,I cannot say enough good things about this CD. I am giving several as gifts to friends. Billy Higgins is the ultimate professional jazz drummer. The tunes include four new compositions by the players and three jazz standards. Every solo seems fresh and yet polished. Mainstream jazz at its very best! You will not be disappointed.Peter Holzer
5,"Thick, beautiful area rug","Rug is well-made, reasonably priced, thicker than most area rugs: all in all, a great purchase."
5,Good storage unit for wine,"We ordered six of these units for wine storage. We've been using them for over a month now and they are exactly what we wanted.There was a delivery problem in that the wrong units were sent. However, follow-up was very prompt and courteous by the seller (Wine Enthusiast), and we actually received the correct units within the originally estimated delivery date range.Pros:Easy to assemble.Compact storage. We stacked the units three high and they are quite stable.Each unit holds 24 750-ml. bottles. Note that if you have all Burgundy and/or Champagne-style bottles, you will not be able to fit six bottles in each of the four compartments. But if you have a mix of bottle styles, it's no problem.Cons:None for our use."
4,Wine on Tap,"This rack was all it was advertised, and once I figured out the directions a snap to put together. Let me add, I am not at all handy and the words ""some assembly required"" sends chills up and down my spine, so the fact that I actually put it together is a testament to how easy it is to put together. It does hold the 24 bottles it advertises, but we have it up against a wall. I am not sure I would put that many bottles in the rack if it was free-standing. For the money, this was a great buy."
4,Great product,I ordered two racks to help with the wine bottle storage in the house. The racks arrived in two days. Extremely easy to assemble. No tools required. Small hex wrench included along with the eight bolts. I assembled the first rack in 15 minutes while talking on the phone. Very easy. The second rack was a little longer due to one of the bolts not aligning with the nut. Still only less than 30 minutes. Decent quality for the price and does look OK in the living room. Another good Amazon purchase.
1,Wrong dimensions in description?,This description looks erroneous. How can it be a cube with the listed dimensions: Product Dimensions: 12 x 7 x 30 inches?I am reluctant to order this product as listed in fear of getting the wrong item (much like the other purchaser and reviewer).
1,Does not crawl,"This looked like a fine idea. The execution, however, is horrible. I tried 3 different golf bags and not one would stay attached when I attempted to pull the cart. I guess the $29.99 price should have clued me to the lack of quality . Objects should work as described.rjero"
1,Very Bad,"Great Idea!!!!! That's where it ends. I've used it a couple of times on the course. The golf bag rotates around and doesn't stay on the base very well. (I even tried to use a rubber strap to hold the bag down on the base. Didn't help!) Very unstable. Doesn't stay upright, so to keep it from falling over, you have to lay your bag down. Defeats the purpose!Go with a standard pull cart. This one just doesn't work."
3,Those newly realizing the problems of adoption will benefit.,"The stories contained in this book provide further reasoning for outlawing adoption altogether, although the authors mean to support the open records movement. They are certainly accurate in pointing out that, where adoption is concerned, a change is necessary. Unfortunately, their alterations are too minor to solve most of the problems adoption creates. This book would be good reading for anyone who has recently begun to accept that adoption is not a perfect (or even remotely GOOD) solution for unplanned pregnancy."
5,An excellent idea,The very fact of this encyclopedia's existence is an excellent idea. So far as I know there is no comparable encyclopedia in scope and quality of American- Jewish men. There of course should be. The short biographies that I read were well- written and informative.In fact reading through the work I had a real sense of the variety and richness of American Jewish life. A very valuable work of reference.
5,'...throws light on the pathways which lead to homelessness.,"This is a remarkable book, based on Maureen Crane's many years of acquaintance with homeless older people. It throws light on the pathways which lead to homelessness, and should be required reading not only for policy makers in this field, but all those interested in the vicissitudes of the human life course."
5,...should be read by everyone concerned with social policy.,Maureen Crane has undertaken research on older homeless people for a number of years. She has now brought together her own empirical studies with the work of others. This book presents a new perspective on an important neglected subject. In a clearly written account the complexity of the issues is shown. This book should be read not only by those interested in ageing but also by everyone concerned with social policy and with social exclusion.
5,Just Can Not Put It Down,"American Paradox is a powerful and moving book, covering an overwhelming amount of research on young black men, race relations, and popular culture. This book can have a positive impact on every African American male who reads it--inspiring them to rise to their full potential. I have read that there are prison inmates reading this life-changing book. I enjoyed reading Reese's engaging, insightful, and refreshing commentary on the plight of young black men. Using original data he integrates various charts and graphs to support his arguments. The book is not driven by ideology but out of the author's commitment to painting a candid picture of the causes and consequences of the behavior of black male youth. This inspirational book will definitely appeal to a diverse audience."
5,Perfect Tray,It is a perfect tray I was looking for my big spoons. All types of spoons are fitted in this tray and my drawer is arranged perfectly.
3,12 3/4 inches is actually 13 inches; go figure.,12 3/4 inches is actually 13 inches; go figure. 12 3/4 inches is actually 13 inches; go figure. 12 3/4 inches is actually 13 inches; go figure. 12 3/4 inches is actually 13 inches; go figure. 12 3/4 inches is actually 13 inches; go figure. .
5,Do yourself a favor and get this one.,"An absolutely one of a kind performer. Subtle and blessed with a remarkable voice Bey delivers a song unlike anyone else I know of. Unhurried, Bey moves through a tune extracting the exact maximum effect from each lyric. Accompanying himself on piano the production is spare and elegant. A great, great singer."
2,a review,"I am very disappointed with this book, I have not gotten her ""sitting on my quilt"" book yet, and it seems that almost all of the quilts in this book are an extension of that book. I frequently don't know about what she is talking.. Hopefully, when I get her ""sitting on my quilt"" book, this book will make more sense to me...it can't stand by itself"
2,Not up to his usual standards!,"Mr. Wood usually writes very well and does even better on the TV. So while there are parts of the book that are interesting. On the whole, I found the book tedious and I finally just gave up on it.Which is a shame, as William and his hard working Scribes deserve a lot better than this!"
4,Very good vegan multi,"I like that you only have to take one/day. This makes it much easier and lasts longer. This is one of the better vegan multi's out there and includes the essentials, like B12, D, and Iodine. After trying many others, so far I've been able to stick with this one. Recommended."
1,Solaray - Vegan Multivitamin,"Ok, to be fair, I was a complete idiot and didn't refrigerate these. So, after being gone a couple days, I came home after a small heat wave and found that my entire room stank. and i mean STANK. it was rancid. stomach turning. Just awful. So, these could be a great multivitamin, and the price was ... decent. If you're a vegan, you should definitely be taking a multivitamin, so if you don't buy these, buy another. Just, don't be stupid and leave them in your night stand."
5,"So far, so good","Well, I'm only on day 3 of this diet, so I haven't seen it all the way through. But, it is the best diet I've ever been on! I'm eating vegetable omelets for breakfast and I'm never hungry at all during the day...he has you eating 6 times a day and I'm feeling so much better just within a few days. I don't have a scale, so I have no clue if I've lost any weight, but I can tell a difference in my clothing already. My mom is diabetic and her doctor recommended this diet for her. My husband is doing a modified version of this diet as well. We both are not obese, but have gained weight since having children. We're both excited about our whole family eating more healthy!"
3,I want breadsticks!!!,"OK. I can honestly tell you that this is a great diet because, Lord knows, I've tried them all so I'm able to compare and contrast. Your desire and appetite for delicious starches and sugars does subside a little with this diet, and I initially did lose weight, but just like ALL other diets I've tried I now want BREAD!!! Maybe I have some genetic flaw, but I just can't make myself stick to any diet. Give me a breadstick or give me death!"
4,"The South Beach Diet: The Delicious, Doctor-Designed, Foolproof Plan for Fast and Healthy Weight Loss","This is not the first time I've bought a book about a special diet. It helps to know how and why a diet works. I've lost 15 pounds so far and even though it's slow going, I expect to lose a lot more."
5,It works!,"I have tried so many different diets and never had the ambition to go through with them; until this book. Because I saw results within the first week, I was motivated to stay on it. The meals are delicious and not difficult to make, although some are more time-consuming than I'm used to. My husband, who's a pretty picky eater, even enjoys SBD dinners. My biggest complaint is that in the first week I felt kind of dizzy and light-headed at times, and found it difficult to exercise, but after a few days I was back to normal and had lost weight even without exercising. You do need to stay on the diet for it to be effective. I went away for a weekend, went off the diet, and gained several pounds back. When I returned home I went back to Phase I for a week and lost those pounds. I've learned so much from this book, that I believe I will be able to continue this way of eating throughout my life."
5,Gift,"I ordered this book for my mother and she seemed happy with it. It's not a new publication, but it's still a popular diet."
1,not a good book,"this book is utter stupidity. Before using it, my weight was 85 kgs, now its 103kgs..... the methods mentioned are not at all useful."
1,Oh please how much money can you make from a book?,Next there will be South Beach Diet food or is there already? I don't have the South Beach Diet umbrella or beach towel. How about a chain of South Beach Diet Restaurants or are you already in discussions about that too?How much more money can Americans waste on a series of diet books under the same title?Especially when there are much worthier causes out there. You (the author) should feel ashamed of yourself milking this book as you do. At least turn some of the proceeds over to something worthwhile like American legend and hero Paul Newman!
1,moronic,"anyone who says carrots are evil is a moron. you'd have to be crazy, or just extremely desperate to lost weight, to buy this book. from the description it seems like a very unhealthy diet, even if you do lose weight. weight loss does not equal healthiness. for a healthy diet see www.hacres.com"
1,worst diet ever,"The south beach diet is telling you not to eat any carbs! That is bad for you! When u reintroduce it you will gain back most of your weight! And to lose weight you just need to eat a balanced meal and excersise. The south beach diet doesnt even put emphasis on excersising, which is a necessity for staying healthy."
1,Yet another fad diet,"If people would just eat right and hit the gym four times a week, they would lose weight.Instead, people are bypassing normal common sense and going for these fad diets.It makes the authors rich, and the readers fatter."
1,This is just what this country needed another SB Diet book!,"Congratulations Mr. Agatston I hear you're building an empire on this South Beach Diet.Meanwhile poverty in America has risen over the past two years by 1.3 million people. Unemployment has shot up by 8.2 million.I'm really looking forward to about forty more of these books all in various size, shapes, colors, titles.Kind of like Chicken Soup for the soul but minus the soul.What's next? Greeting cards?"
1,...,I bought this book for my wife. She didn't get thin. She got fatter.You had to buy all kinds of weirdo food and measure stuff. It was ridiculous.You should stick with Atkins or just go on a cottage cheese diet.
1,In response to the liar,"To the reader claiming to be my old ""friend"", you are an obvious liar. First & foremost, I have been seated with the same people now for nearly 3 years at my current job. Also, my prior employemnt status was all out-of-state. Even more transparent is the fact you sign with a cowardly ""reader"" handle as opposed to signing your user name like the rest of us. Grow up. Maybe you could have lost more than 28 pounds since September, if you moved your fat galoot body away from the puter making up fabricated fantasies."
2,Not for the busy dieter...,"I was so excited to start this book and all of the information is very useful and interesting. But this diet is not for someone who has many responsibilities. Meaning that if you don't have time to cook now, forget about it. I work a full time job and a part time job and there's no way I'll be able to find a stove to use to make the dishes they suggest. Good luck to those who are trying it!"
2,"overly hyped, water weight is all that is lost at first","this book has many fabuolus ideas, but the water weight you loss initially comes back easily if you slip with the carb elimination, which is fine for a bit, but so unhealthy. My wife and i had severe headaches on this diet and don't recommend it."
3,"Great DIET, but the BOOK is blah.","I pulled this diet off of the internet before I read the book. In essence, this diet requires a two-page print-out to adequately follow the diet, NOT A 320 PAGE BOOK!First, let me say that I am totally satisfied with the diet. I have lost 15 pounds in a month, and that included the holiday season. So, the diet is great.The BOOK, however, falls short. The most important thing, it seems to me, is the glycemic index, and the book offers this information on a very limited number of foods. For example, peanuts are fine, but what about almonds? Like other reviewers, I found the recipies to be a total waste of ink.My advice is to find the diet online and then, if you MUST, check the book out from the library. But I promise it is a waste of your time."
4,No cravings,For those that love a strict plan on eating to loose weight I think this book works. A dear friend swears by this diet plan as she has shed some unwanted girth quickly. She sent my wife a copy and I have looked it over. I don't like diets but rather prefer lifestyle changes that are permanent and this book is a pretty guide for achieveing that. The recipes are excellent and there are plenty of them. If you need a meal plan to follow than this book is good for you. Roughly half the book is dedicated to meal planning. The area the book is lacking is a good exercise plan but maybe that is the title of the next book; The South Beach Exercise Program. Anyway this is a worthwhile book that can be followed religiously and it will work(my friend lost fifteen pounds fast)or you can pick and choose items to fit your lifestyle to achieve overall well being. Either way get this book if you want to loose weight and discover the new you.
5,Living proof,"As my mother-in-law recently commented, I'm a living testimonial to this diet. I turned the big 5-0 this year, was pushing 200 pounds hard, and couldn't get my weight down, even with visits to the gym two or three times a week. Then I spent some time with my older sister, who's been on the South Beach diet for almost two years with great success, and decided to give it a shot. That was eight weeks ago and I've dropped 25 pounds as of yesterday's weigh-in at 24 Hour Fitness!The diet just makes sense and is easy to adopt and follow. With thorough and thoughtful explanations from Dr. Agatston and a whole series of meal plans and recipes (including tasty desserts even in Phase One), this book (along with the South Beach Diet Cookbook) can help you rethink and retool your approach to eating. Highly recommended!"
3,diet: yay! book: hmm.......,"It's a truly effective diet, though any remarkably controlled eating program is going to work, if you actually follow it. (Is it any improvement over the Scarsdale Diet I followed decades ago, last time my weight got out of control? Not really. And am I never again going to crave--or eat--the bad carbs he proscribes for life? Heck, no. But be that as it may.)As a book, however, it leaves a lot to be desired. One needs to be very clever to figure out how to plug all the holes left behind in the editorial process, to say nothing of figuring one's way through the multiple contradictions. Some foods are peculiarly unmentioned, or mentioned, at best, in passing. (Onions, anyone?) And the fact that the book is virtually silent on the subject of exercise is a disgrace."
2,A 204 page infomercial,"While it is clear that the diet will work for many people, it does not include all the neccessary information to make good decisions on food choices by yourself. In many respects, it's information is contradictory. For example, It says that during phase one of the diet, you should try to stay away from all dairy products, then so many of the phase one recipes call for low fat cheese products and ricotta cheese. Dr Agatston suggests that the web site for an additional 39.95 for six weeks can be helpful as well. To me, the book itself, chock full of testimonials and recipes but gives little hard core information. It did not give me the information I need to make decisions about different products by reading the nutritional information on the packaging or make informed decisions on my own."
3,"Great DIET, but the BOOK is bland.","I pulled this diet off of the internet before I read the book. In essence, this diet requires a two-page print-out to adequately follow the diet, NOT A 320 PAGE BOOK!First, let me say that I am totally satisfied with the diet. I have lost 15 pounds in a month, and that included the holiday season. So, the diet is great.The BOOK, however, falls short. The most important thing, it seems to me, is the glycemic index, and the book offers this information on a very limited number of foods. For example, peanuts are fine, but what about almonds? Like other reviewers, I found the recipies to be a total waste of ink.My advice is to find the diet online and then, if you MUST, check the book out from the library. But I promise it is a waste of your time."
2,too bad the menu writer didn't read the book (or visa versa),"while the diet itself may be sound, the book is full of contradictions and inconsistancy..For example, during phase 2 the text recommends eating your one (1) carbo later in the day. the menu for day one shows oatmeal and strawberrys for breakfast.this is just one of the numerous examples of careless (and confusing) construction of the book."
5,It Works!!,"I have been on this diet/lifestyle for several years and this works. There is no falling of the wagon, there is no guilt involved. I recommend it to all my patients. I will continue this lifestyle for as long as I can."
2,Can't live life like this!,Unrealistic eating advice. Weight Watchers beats this HANDS down! Not at all what I thought it was! Not for me!
4,easy to follow diet plan,"The south beach diet is a pretty easy diet. phase one (which only lasts two Weeks) is a little tough to follow, but if you do it and put your own twist on it and have fun with the foods (make some new things) you'll get through it.. You don't have to follow the exact meal plan but it is necessary to follow the lists of avoids and enjoys.. I've lost about five pounds and I do slip and cheat sometimes!"
5,Good book,My doctor recommended this book for my diet and I found that it is a good diet for anyone who needs to cut back on their carbs
5,What your doctor Won't or Can't Tell you,That is the book we should all be reading. I think you'll be shocked to read what goes on in the world of medicine. Written by a practicing cardiologist in New York.
3,"Interesting concept, but too restrictive for real life.","The book does a pretty good job of explaining good carbs vs. bad carbs and what they do to one's body. However, after trying the diet, I realized that it was too restrictive and unrealistic. For instance, beer is not allowed at all, and I like to enjoy a beer or two on weekends. Also, I'd like to have a bun with my hotdog and beer. The diet seems like a great concept, but is it something one can do for the rest of one's life? Not really."
1,An Atkins Wannabe,This book is nothing but an almost exact copy of the original Atkins diet.....which was and still is excellent. Save your money.
1,Another Fad Diet,"My husband and I tried the diet for a couple of days. The diet left us feeling weak and sick. I do not think this is a very good diet for people who enjoy food. You should only lose 1-2 pounds a week, and not 8-13 pounds in two weeks!In order for someone to lose weight they need to cut their calories and exercise. In order to lose 1 pound you need to cut 3500 calories a week, and you can do this without cutting out the foods you enjoy."
3,A nice book but not good for Old People,"When i bought this book, it was an inspiration for me to drop some of my old lady pounds. I was going to Florida to visit my two daughters, Denim and Rain, in the Florida penetentary. Whilst I was packing, I had the idea to drop a few pounds so as to fit in my purple tent like Old Woman swimming suit better. So, I bought this book. Some of the dieting techniques were unrealistic and too much to ask of an Old Woman like myself. It was a better book for younger people. The Atkins diet has worked better for me in the past. It helped me accomplish my goal of losing 30 pounds, classifing me as one hot Old Lady!"
1,Atkins Revisited,This book is just a lower-fat version of Atkins. I learned nothing new. Basically a recipe book.
2,Common Sense Works Better,"Just another of the anti-carb, get on the band wagon books. The best way to lose weight and get healthier is to exercise and eat in moderation. This anti-carb stuff is nonsense. If you exercise regularly, don't snack, and eat the good foods like fresh fruit and vegetables, you won't have to worry about gimmick diets. Why can't people wake up and smell the coffee?I don't think people have to give up pasta or anything else that tastes good just so they can follow the latest guru and fad. Eat less, exercise and don't eat if you're depressed. Got it?My late Grandma Jane used to say, ""Everything in moderation, including moderation."" She was right."
2,meals take too long to prep,"I only lasted a week on this diet. The meals took too long to prep. I can't spend 3-4hrs in the kitchen everynite preparing meals for the next day. Also since I'm Asian a lot of the stuff I have to buy its not items I already have on hand, soo it gets pretty expensive for me."
2,South Beach Diet,"I had good intentions, but never followed through. My oncologist recommended this book after I had a colon resection to rid myself of colon cancer."
3,the longest i ever practiced a diet - three days!,"then i started to see results, literally my belly was finally flat in three days. i realized that so many carbs in my diet was causing me to bloat badly. so im going to try to go back onto the south beach diet, but this time with less salty and meat based foods. i ended up eating more meat than vegetables, which isn't what he subscribes, and caused me to have diarrhea anyway. next time i go back on the diet it will be more balanced, like the doctor prescribed!"
4,"Weight Falls Off-Great for post baby weight loss, even when breastfeeding","This diet is one of the easiest diets I have ever done. It's healthy and basically high protein, lots of veggies and a few treats along the way. I don't use any kind of fake fats nor fake sugar because of the danger of using these products, so I basically either skipped these suggestions during the two week initial diet program and afterwards made baked organic apples with plain no sugar homemade whip creame or raw organic apple or some other kind of OG fruit that was high in fiber such as dates which are also sweet and take the sweet tooth edge off. I didn't gain a ton of weight during my pregnancy. However the last 10 lbs have just been sticking around. I am also breastfeed and with the elimination of all whites, white sugar, white flour, white rice the weight is just falling off. And it hasn't caused any problems in my 7 month old exclusively nursing daughter. This is a totally ""doable"" diet."
2,Diet great Cook book ?,"Having enjoyed cooking for close to 50 years and having purchased a library of 100+ or so cook books (many before the Internet and many of which I have read almost cover to cover) as well as professional training, I think the diet is sound and works, however the cook book needs editing and better testing of recipes. Explanations on how to do certain steps (which are important to beginners) are missing in some recipes, a number of the recipes really don't work (as others have said and should be changed or eliminated), most need additional flavors/spice to be acceptable and fair portion are really good (Kudos)- suggest you only use as guideline and add herbs, spices and cooking styles accordingly. Good luck"
2,"Shame on you, Dr. Agatston !!!","Not that South Beach is a bad diet. On the contrary, it's a very good diet. However, give credit where credit is due!Phase I is essentially the Atkins Diet; Phases II and III are basically the Zone Diet.However, I'm giving you an extra star for your ingenuity in combining the best parts of the two diets: Atkins for rapid weight loss and Zone for weight maintenance and good health and nutrition. I have been on both diets and know from experience."
5,South Beach Diet,"Awesome Book!! even if one chooses not to follow this diet, there is a great deal of useful information regarding how the body processes what we eat"
3,This Diet Is Doable,"The diet gave me the impression I could eat as much as I wanted, as long as I ate the right things. I don't think so. The diet still requires moderation and cutting back on portions. For me giving up bread, beer and deserts, then cutting back on fats and pastas (which I love), is making a differnce, about 5 pounds in two weeks. Have been experimenting with the less fatty (good & expensive) types of steaks for the leaner and cheaper cuts, and trying to tenderize them. Still the easiest way to get the protein. The one glass of red wine, is real easy to end up being two or three. But probably better than 2 or 3 beers. I would like to get off my meds, the weight loss will be the (bonus) deserts that I miss. Good Luck."
3,It's a cookbook,"I looked at this book for research purposes, not really interested in going on a diet right now... my general impression: The diet itself can be basically summarized in a page or two (it's practically on the back cover), so, really, you might think about borrowing the book versus buying for diet purposes, and writing the three phase plan down. The science behind the plan is, as most of dietetics, under question and debate, although there does seem to be a consensus that the American addiction to simple carbohydrates is a health problem. What is more interesting about the book is that a large chunk of it is devoted to recipes based on the phase of diet, a few which I have tried and seem to be worthwhile. Other people must also think so, as there have been spinoff south beach diet cookbooks that have also been successful (haven't tried them yet). So, one might consider purchase for that reason."
2,ATKINS/PROTEIN POWER RIP OFF,"I was excited about reading this book but I have to agree with many of the other readers that is is an Atkins rip off! I really found this diet to be almost identical to the Protein Power plan by Dr.& Dr. Eades who published their book in 1996. If you are new to the low carb diet scene, you may find this book helpful. But to anyone who has low carb experience DON'T your money on this - there isn't really much new information here in regards to low carb dieting."
1,Montignac revisited,"The South Beach Diet is simply the Montignac diet renamed and repackaged: Same operating principles, same philosophy, same indexes, and same results."
2,A rip off of the Zone Diet,"Get the 'original' balanced nutrition diet, instead of a copy-cat.I would hope that all the professional book reviewers would know enough about the subject to at least comment on the similarities between this diet and an 8 year old successful diet program."
1,Where have I read this before?,"I liked this book the first time I read it. When it was called ""The Atkins Diet"". If rehashing what someone else wrote is all it takes to write a best seller, then I'm on my way."
2,"Inconsistent, and lacks information....","Check this book out of the library before you decide whether you're going to buy it. While the plan seemed somewhat sensible, it really bothered me that this book never says anything about restrictions. For example, pregnant or nursing mothers are given no guidelines one way or the other. In the glycemic index chart, I'm supposed to believe that brown rice (whole grain) has a higher glycemic index than instant rice? Or that a PB sandwich is not healthy under any circumstances. The testimonials throughout the book were also a bit obsessive. Most of them were too scared of food to go off the phase 1 diet. I know the basic idea works (tried it under a few different names), but I don't think this book is the best version. Too many foods are labelled ""bad"" to enable the reader to make rational decisions."
3,Is It Good or Is It Bad?,"I received a glorious, full-color brochure about the South Beach Diet from Prevention. It all sounded too good to be true, even the price of the book was unreal ($30.00 plus postage and handling.) So I decided to check the reviews on Amazon.com. There are many glowing recommendations plus a few negative reviews. Most of the naysayers also have valid points to make. I understand about severely restricting the carb intake, but what if (like me) a person doesn't like fish and seafood, doesn't like yogurt, doesn't like tofu, etc. And, will never eat fat-free cheese (that is really an oxymoron, don't you think?), then what? Is this diet of any use to someone with those types of restrictions? Can you make a success of this diet even though you eliminate the above foods from the diet? Just wondering. Would like to know thoughts on that before buying and trying this book."
2,May not be supported by science,"The book offers good points on dieting and cardiac health, but the diet itself is not supported by strong science. A search of Medline did not find the two studies cited in the book, or any other study of this diet... From what are indicated in the book, these two studies are rather weak scientifically. Interested readers could find a comment published in the Harvard Health Letter, 29(1):5, 2003 Nov. It would be interesting to see if this other publication has enough details point out the lack of science supporting the claims of this diet book. I have not have a chance to read this yet.The book does serve as a reminder that a diet consists of low amount of ""bad"" fat and lower calories (by having sensible portions and restricting carbohydrate) makes sense for healthy eating. Looking at the recommended list of carbohydrate, the diet is recommending a low carbohydrate diet in contrary to the author's claim that it is not a low carbohydrate diet."
2,"And yet, another book to add to my collection...","I just jumped on the bandwagon and bought this book only to realize that from it, I learned nothing new. This diet has been around for decades in principal, and puts into words, everything an experienced dieter already knows. Cut out white flour in all forms, cut fat, eat vegetables and lean meats, and walk for exercise. What's new about that? This diet is a sound plan, but the book falls seriously short in justifying things such as why tomatoes should be avoided, how much is too much, and whether in the cold months, canned tomatoes can be substituded. Everyone should know that walking is the safest and easiest way to burn fat when you're overweight so I did not miss an elaboration on exercise, although the author should have promoted its importance more. Half the book has recipes that are useless and in most cases not practical. As I said, it's another diet book for my collection, but it only served to reaffirm what I already knew. Wasted money."
3,Not for us.,Me and the Mrs. were trying diets and this one just isn't for us. I'm sure it works but it's very pricey to eat as they say to.
3,Easy to follow,"I'm not sure if it's selfish to give this book 3 stars, but I would've preferred a more extensive list of the ""go"" or ""no-go"" foods rather than a ton of reading and recipes. It's easy to follow if you want to sift through recipes, but most of the recipes were a little too much work for my taste. I would've preferred a list of acceptable foods, which there was one, but I would've preferred the list be more extensive."
3,Good start. Finish??? Well....we'll see...,"I too had very impressive results with this diet. I lost nearly 26lbs. in a very short period of time. Now, however, after 5 months of struggling to strictly adhere to the diet I am ready to cry uncle. More than anything in the world I'd like to stuff my face with a big mac!Don't get me wrong - I really did learn a great deal about nutrition from the book, and I'm sure it's a sound diet that does work (it worked for me). Also, I haven't put back on ALL the weight I lost and I'm sure I'm healthier, so I still feel as though the book has helped me. I do admit though, that I'm struggling which I'm sure is normal, but I haven't thrown in the towel just yet. In conclusion, I do like the diet and think it's worth giving it a try. I just think that any diet is hard to indefinitely adhere to."
5,Simple Diet that Really Works,"I would recommend this book to anyone who has tried other ""fad"" diets and struggled with the hunger and lack of results. The thing I really liked about this book, was that he not only tells what you need to do and how to do it, but provides the recipies to back it up. Other diets simply make you buy other books to get the recipies. I see this book as helping people change their lifestyles, not just diet, which is the key. I lost 20 lbs. and counting. Good book easy read and very helpful."
2,Not Much Here,"There's no real reason to purchase this book, other than furthering your low carb' curiosity. He writes well, it's casual almost to the point of just so much fluff. Many things seem to come straight from Atkins' work. The recipes in the back sound delicious but frankly, most people I know don't have the time or inclination to make some of these 5 Star Hotel Meals - low carb' or not. Read the Atkins book for some in depth work on how our bodies work, diabetes and so forth. If you read this one, it's just so you can say you did."
4,Good book - not a diet a lifestyle change!,"They really shouldn't call it a diet, because it isn't. Its just a better way to eat and it easily achievable by anyone!"
4,South Beach Diet,"I found this diet very difficult to follow in the first stage. I was not eating enough greens,and I missed my fruits terribly. I had to restart twice because I ate a piece of fruit.The weight loss was mostly water at first,but boosted my ego.I am on the third week ,and there is real weight loss now,almost 15 lbs.This is not just a diet but a life style."
5,A Great Book For Guidance of Good Eating Habits!,"This a great book to guide you in the healthy way of eating. It proves you don't have to starve yourself to lose or maintain your weight in a healthy way. Try it-It's good for all ages! My daughter who is a young teenager is enjoying the balance of foods and is losing weight slowly which is the key to any diet! TRY IT YOU""LL LIKE IT!"
3,"It makes sense, but.....","I bought the book and desperately wanted to do the South Beach Diet. The arguements made in the book are sound.However...As a slightly picky eater, the menu felt limited to me. (The dependence on eggs made me feel like I could never eat breakfast...and my cholestoral wasn't happy either)The list of foods isn't as complete as I'd like...a glaring ommision was diet soda...could I drink it or not?The recipes in the back felt a little fancy...I'm a city girl, not a cook.It might work for you, but I'd suggest taking it out of the library before buying the book."
2,Slimming Down,I just started to get into the South Beach Diet and I think this may do the trick; if one follows it correctly. I will write back when I have lost some weight and give a better critique.
2,Atkins with some good recipes,"I find it amazing that the book starts out with ""not low carb"". That's exactly what it is. To me its just a rehash of the Atkin's plan which, I personally, think is incredibly unhealthy. I read it and immediately got rid of it. It gets two stars for a few good recipes."
4,Absolutely great!,This book has been so informational and helpful with starting and staying on the South Beach diet and nutritional information in general.
5,This Diet Really Works,"This is a diet that really works, and that I can stay on. I feel good, not deprived, and for the first time, can see myself staying on it for life. The good news is, that you really can eat alot and even cheat sometimes. It's the best."
3,good...for my husband- NOT ME!,"the premise is good, and the diet actually works for my husband. I on the other hand- lost weight in the first two weeks- but i lost my mind as well! i was craving all sorts of things- things i wouldnt normally care for...My husband however, has not craved a single potato chip, not one piece of chocolate, bowl of ice cream or slice of pizza (let alone all at once- like me!) he's lost 25lbs in 4 weeks and feels good. i lost 8-10 \lbs in the same amount of time and have 'cheated' the plan often. i thought i was motivated, really wanted to lose some weight, understood the concepts and enjoyed the recipes- but i'm very discouraged. It may not have anything to do with the actual plan...maybe i'm just a CARBOHYDRATE ADDICT! sigh......."
5,"Great diet, easy-to-read book","The reason why low-carb diets are so popular is that you get to lose weight without feeling hungry. And the South Beach diet seems a lot healthier and just more reasonable than the Atkins diet. My partner and I have both lost weight, and it fells like this diet has been a ""secret weapon,"" because it has been so easy. This is definitely a diet that you can stay on indefinitely - especially since it starts out strict for the first two weeks, but then becomes a lot more ""liveable.""The book is really easy to read and easy to understand. And the menus in the second half of the book, even if you don't follow them exactly (you don't have to) are really good for giving you an idea of how to eat, especially for the first two weeks."
3,Do not buy this book if you are allergic to eggs or milk.,"Just a warning that if you allergic to eggs or milk it is better not to buy this book. His plan calls for eggs almost every morning. Also, if you are well versed with the glycemic index value of foods, you might find this book repetitive. This weight loss plan is a version of a low-glycemic diet plan.If, however, you do not know about the glycemic index and how the body reacts to refined carbs, you will need to read this book or any other article that explains it."
5,Fantastic,"I decided to try this diet after reading other costumer reviews on amazon. I'm 12 days in and I've lost 10 pounds. The first week was a challenge, because although I wasn't hungry, I was also never full. I never had the sensation that I'd eaten enough. By the second week I was accustomed to the new eating style and no longer found myself with that weird empty feeling. Remarkably I found it incredibly easy to leap the pitfalls of corporate america... such as people bringing in donuts and cookies every other day. Yes, the first week I was bitter, but the second week I was so thrilled with the results that no donut or cookie could tempt me. Not only is there a difference in my weight, there's a difference in my moods. My temper has evened out. Maybe that four Cokes a day habit I had going wasn't doing any part of my body any good."
5,a diet for those who hate dieting,"I began the Southbeach diet on January 1st (2004) and have managed to stay on it for nine months. It is very easy to follow because eventually you lose your taste for sugar (my big problem.)The book is well written. There are testimonies which are very helpful. The diet plan is spelled out simply. There are recipes as well, but to be honest, I never followed those. The foods listed are easy enough to cook with out having to disguise them. (although I do think that Agatston could probably come up with a recipe that would make even CAT food appealing...)Give this diet book a try. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
3,DELICIOUS FRUSTRATION,"I found this book, like so many other diet cook books to be full of sound medical/nutritional information. However, many of the menus and recipes assume you have access to elite food shopping. I, for one do not. In order to follow this plan, one must have a pretty good foundation in nutrition, love to cook, and be creative in making the right substitutions for impossible to get ingredients. I lost weight on the Atkins diet, but got sidetracked. I'll have a go at this one, too.I found the book to be very badly indexed. Also, the author contradicts himself a number of times.Go ahead, do the diet. It's a reasonable one. If you are really honest about it, you'll loose weight."
3,10 pounds in week 1,"I give the overall book 3 stars, the overall diet 5 stars. There is some confusing/conflicting information... for example not to use reduced-fat this or that, but then seeing reduced-fat this or that in the recipies.They give you a food list of goods and bads, so if you don't want to follow the recipes, you don't have to. I walked for .5 mile per day (only about 10 minutes) and followed everything so far for 7 days. I cheated once, more out of convenience (ran out of lettuce and was too tired to go out) and had some pizza. I weighed in today with 10 pounds off.I have never lost 10 pounds on any diet and comparing this to Atkins, I think you can stick with this more for the long haul since there are healthier and sweeter choices to eat. I'd recommend giving it a try!"
3,Diet Plan,"I heard this is a very popular diet. With any diet you have to be mentally ready to eat what they ask of you. I have been on it now for about a week 1/2, lost nothing yet and find myself craving chocolate a lot. I am sure every body is different. It might work great for some and not at all for others. Good luck! :-)"
2,Be wary of this FRUITLESS diet!,"I tried my hand at this diet, and I can't say that it worked for me. It may for some, but it's not exactly a sure thing."
1,Poorly edited.,"I was disappointed when I found the publisher was Rodale. Shame on you. The index was minimal and I couldn't find what I was looking for. What is 1 wedge of Laughing Cow Light Cheese? I don't want to read every word in the book to find this. Yet many of the recipes have this. I saw this as a revamped Atkins and nothing more. There is no ""true"" instruction for the diet. Just follow the recipes for 2 weeks. The book is sort of divided in half. The first half follows a lot of the Atkins mind-set. Then ends. The second half has sceduled meals and recipes for Phase one, two, and three. Sounds like Atkins doesn't it - only with less clarity. I'm disappointed. I think this HAD the potential to be a good book, but the editor didn't edit or suggest."
2,A Glorified Adkins Diet,"After receiving this book, I realized that it was the Adkins Diet with just a few things added or taken away. It is basically the same thing. High protien, low carbs. I was not aware of this untill I spoke to someone who was losing weight and she said she was on the adkins diet. The only difference really is that this book gives you recipies and daily menue plans. So you are just getting a more detailed Adkins diet. It is not anything new, just a new name."
1,South Beach Diet a Bust!!,"This book is way to restrictive. If you have trouble sticking with a diet then this is NOT the diet for you. You are not allowed any of the NORMAL foods for the first two weeks. Sheer agony!!! No dairy, fruit,pasta, potatoes, sugar, etc. It only gets worse. Resold back on Amazon to someone who hopefully has more will power than me!!"
2,Haven't I read this book before?,"Eh. Just another Atkins copycat. It's nice to get a variety of perspectives on low-carb dieting, and this book does add a couple good suggestions not covered in Atkin's book, but by and large it's simply an uncredited duplicate of the same plan."
4,You'll Lose Weight,"It's no simpler than that. Follow the menus and you lose the weight. And this is coming from someone who kept plateauing, even while working out 5 times a week. Honestly, I lost 10 pounds in the first 7 days (and this was even after I swallowed occasional handfuls of M&Ms;).It has a good clean emphasis on eating well (good proteins, good fats, plenty of fresh vegetables) with an admonishment to avoid processed food, fast food, and food with trans fats. And of course, sugar.Small drawback: In this economy, this is not the diet to go on if you are on a fixed income. My grocery bill doubled during Phase 1 weeks, from having to buy so many exotic vegetables (okay, so eggplants and artichokes were exotic to me...) nuts, olive oil and spices. The bonus is, that with the varied foods, you never really want to binge because the food TASTES great. You feel full, and you even get desserts each day. My doctor recommended this diet to me, and I'm glad she did."
1,Broken Promises,"I just was at the book store and read a good portion of this book. I was shocked to read that it promises 8-13 pounds of weight loss in two weeks and that is says you will lose belly fat first. That is one of the biggest lies I have ever read in a weight loss book. This doctor is feeding you a line.I have been overweight for 25 years. I know it is my behavior. I just can't get it together. So, to hear this author promise me something that is impossible really made me mad.I want everyone reading this to know that there is one book I did like and did lose weight with. It's called Flip The Switch by Jim Karas. He talks about everything in his book, such as how to eat, exercise and set realistic weight loss goals. My best friends is down 47 pounds and has never looked better.Please, please, anyone reading this post, buy Flip and get the reality of weight loss, not Dr. Phil's fantasy."
2,This book sucks.,"This is not a diet - it's called starving. You don't need a book to do that. Everything on the menu is tasteless and/or horrid. People want miracles - but I truly believe moderation is the best solution. Why eliminate everything enjoyable from your diet? The only thing you have to do is eat LESS - rocket science and miracles are not involved. Anyone can lose weight eating shrubbery and calorie-free genetic defect-inducing sugar - no book necessary. Do yourself a favor and avoid the freaky 10-calorie sugar-fee gelatin ""snack""."
3,Quick delivery,"Its a good book, but we couldn't stick to it. It wasnt an easy life style change for us. We've found something else that works for us so I guess we'll be getting rid of this book. The shipping was fast and the book was in great condition."
5,Great Food for Thought and Action,"The book ""The South Beach Diet""* (purchased from Amazon.com)makes excellent reading. The first 90 pages gives a throughly believable rationale for the recommendations and recipes in the rest of the book. I've loaned the book to friends and would recommend it to other people.PMF*The South Beach Diet: The Delicious, Doctor-Designed, Foolproof Plan for Fast and Healthy Weight Lossbtw: I no longer live in SC!!!"
4,"Worked for a friend, but not for me","This is a great diet. If you can commit to it and it didn't suit my lifestyle of traveling and children. However, I have two girlfriends who have lost and kept the weight off.I ended up using Dr. Stephen Gullo's book and it really worked for me. I'm a beauty and lifestye writer/editor. This is a great book, just preview the first paragraph or two to make sure it will work for you. Otherwise, like me, you'll have to pass it on. Jillian Hurley [...]"
2,Not for the average busy person!,"The diet is o.k., but for me living in New York and always on the go, this diet is not for me. There is no way that I have the time to cook London Broil and Flank steak when I come in from work. If you are a person who does not arrive home until after nine at night then the diet will be hard for you to follow. Just thinking about when to prepare the foods is just so difficult. If the diet was something similar to Weight Watchers, then it would be easier. There is just too, much preparation and if you do not have time to prepare your food then this diet will not work. Please, don't even think about eating some of these dishes at the restaurant because it will cost you an arm, a leg, and a lung. The food sounds good, but it is not for a busy person."
1,Come on people!,"If you were to get someone to perform open heart surgery, would you get a dietitian or a cardiologist? Probably a cardiologist, right? If you were going to find someone to adequately evaluate your diet, would you pick the dietitian or the cardiologist? If you chose the former, please don't buy this book. People who buy this book make me want to bash my head into the wall. Speaking as a dietitian, the only thing this book is good for is correcting uneven furniture, or maybe starting a nice yule tide fire. If you got this book for Christmas, please return it, but not before . . . [chastising] the person who got it for you. There's a reason why people inside the nutrition community don't write these books, only morons with catchy titles and degrees not dealing with nutrition. And if you disagree with me, you're wrong."
1,HEY!!!!,"Put down the Big Mac.Kill your television.Get off the couch.Be not afraid.Live, damn-it! LIVE!!!"
1,Hum,"Someone recommened this diet to control cholesterol. Doubt I'll actually read it entirely. Not sure what I was thinking... a diet book? Well, anyway, that's my review or non-review."
3,"Frank Addleman, Professsor Emeritus,Nutrition&Fitness","This is a much better diet plan than the Atkins Diet. Experts would agree on that. This diet will get you started but if you want to really become healthy you need the motivation for change. Try my book, GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, THINK HEALTHY, BE HEALTHY. It will make the complex issues of health and fitness easy to understand."
3,losing weight,Good Book! I dont follow it real strict I pay attention to everything in Book. I have lost some Weight & I feel better!
3,IS THAT ALL THERE IS??,"Just got this book and gave it a quick read. Most of the info is jammed into a few chapters. The rest of the book is recipes and the meal plans for stages one to three. I was disappointed that there was not more emphasis on phase one. Although I did start the diet today! It looks to be quite similar to the Lindora weight loss plan or the Suzanne Sommers Somercize plan where you include vegetables in the low fat, heavy protein plan. The good news is that Dr. Agatston's credentials are very impressive. The info about when and how to eat various types of carbs and fats is a nice addition to any dieter's repetoire. Although he warns against staying on stage 1 for more than 14 days some of his endorsers (included in the book) say they did stay on stage one for months. Several of the recipes look like they are keepers such as the spinach cups and the ricotta desserts. Might be worth the price just for those and of course for motivation for the next round in the fight on fat."
3,The South Beach Diet,"If you can't stick to the Atkins diet then this one will be even more of a challenge because with Atkins you get to eat higher fat contented foods where as with South Beach you have to choose the lower-fat, lower-calorie versions of the food you get to eat on the Atkins, I would recommend starting with Atkins(the strictest low carb plan) then after induction phase, try South Beach's induction then phases 2&3 shouldn't be too much of a problem to stick to."
5,definately works-- this isn't even a diet--just a guide to healthier eating,"i lost that stubborn weight with this diet. some people have been posting on their reviews that this is similar to atkins....well if they did their homework, they would see that it is NOTHING like atkins..and its not carb-counting either,....you eat plenty of good carbs.i.e. vegetables ..something you couldnt do with atkins.lean meats...again something that wasnt emphasized with atkins.desserts that are much more satisfying and healthier...recipies for anything under the sun!this is just a guide to the way people SHOULD be eating....none of that white starchy processed stuff..the foods taste better and are better for you.my energy was high all day...i looked all out healthier ...not to mention i dropped the pounds that i wanted.but trust me...its nothing like atkins....i did atkins and i quit after the first day...atkins is def. not healthy for you either.this really works!!!"
5,A diet I can live with!,"At last, a diet that makes sense, is healthy, and is easy to follow.Yes, the diet is low in carbs, but, after the first 2 weeks, you add in fruit and high-fiber carbs. You don't go crazy on fatty foods, so this seems much more medically sound than the Atkins diet. I'm finding it very easy to be on the South Beach Diet, and it is extremely satisfying.There are also a number of excellent recipes in the book, but you don't have to cook to stay on the diet. It's not difficult to eat out on this diet at most types of restaurants.All I can say is that I love the book, and think I can stay on a program like this for the rest of my life. At least I hope so."
4,"Best low carb diet out there, but not for all","I think alot of the critics of this diet are missing the boat. I've tried counting calories, portion control, but my hunger is always so overwhelming. This is due to the fact that I'm overweight and insulin resistant, and also, fluctuating hormones can put my appetite in overdrive. If I have one chocolate, I can't stop. If I eat sugary cereal for breakfast, I'm out of control the whole day. This is the ONLY diet that reduces my cravings, and allows me to have willpower. I'm no longer irritable, hungry, and I sleep like a baby. I think this diet works best for people like me, not athletic people who train hours a day, you need carbs! It's all about your individual body chemistry!! I think the most important thing is is to first figure out what diet works for you best. The Metabolic Typing Diet helped me determine that low carb is best for me. Then I chose South Beach from there."
5,I lost 30 pounds in 8 weeks!,"I lost 30 pounds in 8 weeks, never starved, have kept it off and cut my cholesterol by two-thirds. Enough said!"
2,I have made up my mind: no way am I doing this,"After reading reviews of this book in which people describe becoming constipated,dizzy,listless or even fatter, I have decided not to follow the plan.(That and one has to read 110 pages before finding the meal plans)The one good thing? I've discovered a good h'ors douvres recipe(the vegetable quiche cups) as well as a new way to make spinach."
4,Monkeypox,"I think that human monkeypox can be cured by the south beach diet, and/or killing all prairie dogs in the tri-state area."
1,So Tired of the whole South Beach Fad!,Read the first review after reading or trying to read the book and it's true just eat less and exercise. We all know that why do we constantly forget it. Anyway - I've seen far too many South Beach Diet Books perhaps the author whom I believe is a medical doctor could write a new book with a new title and simplify it. We can all use a short reminder!
2,"Rehash of The Zone & Sugarbusters, but harder to follow...","This diet is a pain in the ass. You have to follow a daily menu based on complicated, time-consuming recipes and expensive ingredients. So a lot of time, money and above-average cooking skills are required. The worst part of this book is that it gives virtually no guidance on substitute foods, or how to use this diet without following its difficult menu regime."
3,Low Carb,"Not a bad book, certainly, but much of the advice is either homespun or just impossibly to follow. I don't mind a healthy diet program, but this book has a feeling of ""fad"" about it that I just didn't find useful."
2,Did not like,it was tootime consuming and was not for me. I gave it too a friend who wanted to read it.
3,So So,"One of many books that I have bought looking for a way to loose weight. Prehaps that is the wrong word. I can loose the weight, I just seem to be able to find it again again."
4,A diet book,The book is fine. What can one say about a diet book. It explainedeverything to me. I would buy it again.
5,Easy to follow,"Simple, easy, fast. I have lost 6 pounds. I feel great! It works for me and I hope for you too."
4,Excellent and easy to follow,"I have to admit that I was unsure about whether or not I could ""stick"" to The South Beach Diet"", however I must say that it is easier than I thought and found that it's bascially common sense."
3,Not good if you're hypoglycemic,"I learned a lot about nutrition from this book, and have some really great snack options now, like low-fat cheese sticks and sugar-free jello cups. But I'm hypoglycemic and this diet unfortunately didn't work for me. By day 4 I was increasingly lightheaded and nauseous. I fell asleep at my desk on day 3 and day 4, something I NEVER do. The diet is designed to let your body normalize it's own sugar levels once you start eating the low-carb meal plans. But if you're hypoglycemic or tend towards having low blood sugar, this will probably not be the diet for you. Without eating any sugar (no carbs including fruit, juice, bread, pasta, etc. for the first 2 weeks) my body wasn't able to keep my blood sugar up. It's unfortunate, because it's a fun diet to try!"
3,Not necessary to buy the book to go on the diet,"I just started this diet and got the book. The recipes look good, and I think it's going to be an effective diet, but the book doesn't have a generalized meal plan (just a day by day menu of specific foods -- I can't follow that specific menu plan!). You can get the same things off of various web sites (google 'south beach diet'). A friend sent me the generalized meal plan (e.g. it tells you: breakfast: - protein unlimited, vegetables minimum 1/2 cup, fruit none, starch none, milk 2 cups daily, fat, 1 tsp oil) - but the book doesn't have that!"
5,I love this diet/cuisine/lifestyle,"OK, it is healthier and all that, but wow! The recipes are fabulous, I'm fitting into clothes I have not in ten+ years, and after the terrible threesome holidays have been cheating daily but not quite enough to tip the scales against me ... but the BEST part of this plan is that I'm just not ravenously hungry all the time like I used to be. The first couple weeks were weird, no worse than the first few weeks of kicking anything else but not a whole lot easier either - but worth it!! I am enjoying the freedom from sugar addiction!"
2,Befuddled,"I felt limited in my food choice with this book. I know that you give up most all carbs for the first two weeks, however, I would have liked to have a glycemic index guideline that I could follow. This would have allowed me a greater range of foods that would still be ""allowable"" during Phase I. Also, I found a LOT of conflicting information. For example, you cannot have carrots during phase I, but at least one recipe in Phase I calls for carrots! Also, some of the portions are confusing. For example it lists 20 peanuts as a food to enjoy during Phase I. Does this mean limit yourself to no more than 20 peanuts a day, a meal or a week? I just feel a little more information on the diet itself is needed. The explanations of good carbs vs. bad carbs are good, but more time needs to be expended on the plan itself."
5,The answer to the diet contrversy,"This book is a very good read and addresses the questions regarding the ""high carb"" or ""high fat"" controversy. It is far from a rehash of the low carb books of the past. It explains how to control hunger through food choices and food preparation and processing and provides needed answers to the current confusion about diet."
4,"Going, going, gone","I've been on the SBD for almost four months and the weight is just sliding off. Those that crave carbs obviously don't get the program, it's about changing how you eat, what you eat and how you treat food. Carbs aren't out of the question; they just have to be eaten in moderation-and evil carbs such as white bread, white rice, and white potatoes should be avoided on a regular basis (basically, stay away from anything that's been milled so much it has the nutritional value of a boot). There are great whole grain options out there, as well as wonderful modifications to traditional recipes. The greatest part about this diet is that unlike other low-carb diets, you can easily modify it and live within it."
2,"use your HEAD, not some DIET!","This is a good plan for those who need to follow some sort of ""diet,"" but a better read is ""The Overfed Head"" by Rob Stevens. Stevens teaches how to learn to pay attention to what your body actually needs instead of filling your head with all kinds of diet regimens. It's much better to let your body's own natural instincts guide your behavior rather than what some diet seller tells you to do! It's also the only book you'll ever need to buy since there are no special recipes to sell you....you use your favorite foods and your BRAIN!!!"
1,Dangerous diet. Quick results but will cost you your health,"This diet is dangerous. It works because you are BURNING out your ADRENALS. You will fry your hormones with this diet.For you low carbers- haven't you noticed that whenever you low carb diet, you get headaches and insomnia???? This is called a CLUE.Do NOT do this diet, or you will pay the piper with your HEALTH.Exercise and having a PROPER diet with proper REST is the ONLY way to diet.After having completed this expensive diet, you WILL gain the weight back, and then some.Buyer Beware!"
3,SOUTH BEACH DIET Doesn't Beat Mimi's Common Sense,"The SOUTH BEACH DIET along with other fad diet books have been floating around our house lately. Most like SOUTH BEACH present complicated eating plans with complex rationales that are so confusing I'm surprised anyone can loose weight on them. The core of any healthy plan to control your weight is plain and simple. Watch what you eat and be active. My grandmother Mimi, put it best, ""Moderation in all things."" And she had shapely legs and 7 inch ankles into her nineties. Mimi spent her money on books of love poems and chocolates for Valentine's instead of a diet book, and kept in shape working and loving hard."
1,Never recieved it!!,"I ordered this product, paid for it, and NEVER recieved it!! It makes me really mad, and this is not the first time I have heard of this happening through amazon!!"
2,Awful Meal Plans,This book seemed ok until i actually started a diet. I'm 14and overweight. THe book said the meals were godd and that u wouldnt be hungry. That was definetly not true. I did lose some belly fat though. This is a godd diet to lose alittle weight but as for the meal plans they just suck!
4,it really really works,"i've been on the south beach diet for one week, and i've already lost seven pounds. i get hungry eventually, but not the kind of starving feeling i'd get when i was craving bad carbs. now i'm satisfied after i eat, and i feel much healthier. this book is seriously worth it."
3,It seems so hard,"I've only been on this diet for about a week, but I haven't lost any of my cravings. The breakfast part is hard for me, because i'm not really one to enjoy eggs. I haven't noticed any weight loss either. It would be much better if we could enjoy ""real"" desserts that are sugar free besides ricotta cheese and jello."
2,Low-Carb And Low-Fat Is A Recipe For Disaster,"This darling of the media diet plan attempts to merge the best of both the low-carb diets like Atkins with the low-fat diets like Ornish. The problem is mixing together low-carb and low-fat is a recipe for disaster. When you cut your carbohydrates in your diet, you need to replace that energy source with something--that's where dietary fat comes in. It's the fuel for your body in the absence of carbohydrate. If you follow Dr. Arthur Agatston's plan, then you might lose weight but you'll be constantly hungry and lacking in energy necessary to function in life. There are much better nutritional plans out there, includingThe New Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling GreatandThe Paleo Solution: The Original Human Diet."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I got my South Beach Diet CD today with great expectations!Instead I recieved an Audio of a boring chattering. I wanted to see an actual plan and thought I was getting that. I did not wish to with-stand 3hours of blaaah!I hope to return this CD and let you know from what I could get from it, was that it is just the Atkins Diet going by a different name!!! I truly hope the book is better than the Audio that I did not order!"
2,Skip all three phases,"I haven't started this program and I'm not sure I'm going to,but I had to see what all the fuss was about, so I bought it.The first problem I have with this is that you have to read 110 pages before you get to the Phase One menu plan and while I like the conversational tone of the book, I didn't appreciate having to search for the plan itself. The other thing that puzzles me is all the eggs he has you eating; I thought the most a person should eat was maybe two or three a week, and spinach for breakfast?! under an egg? YUK! and VEGETABLE juice?! I don't know about most people, but I get up at 6am and eggs and vegetable juice that early turns my stomach.if you want to lose weight, eat less and exercise more..like mom might've said."
2,"Not bad, but mostly water loss","I am trying this diet. You might lose a few pounds at first due to dehydration and water loss. Side effects I experienced were: headaches, nausea and then constipation and heartburn. I subscribed to the web site hoping I'd get more assistance, but it seems to be run by a bunch of low-paid children who don't ever answer peoples' questions. Promised features and updates just don't happen. You find the ever-helpful volunteers who do their best, but no other staff in sight to assist. I think Prevention.com is the best answer to get further information on your South Beach Diet. There is an extensive archive of Dr. Agatston's question and answer (more than his own wimpy web site!) and a large message board forum of experienced Beachers. Along with the book, I'd advise going there. Bottom line-- if you have trouble with carbs and they are the key to your weight gain, this is great for you. If you are just ""Joe Blow Dieter"" then you might be disappointed by slower weight loss."
2,"Great concept, but not convenient","The book has a great concept on food and what to eat, it was very interesting. The problem is, it's not friendly for people who work 12 hours a day. All the meals need an oven. I work 70 hours a week, there is no way that the meals would fit into my schedule, unless I eat at 11:00 at night! The recipes look delicious and I'll try them, but this diet is not for workaholics."
1,"A ""wish I had thought of that"" copy of Atkins","This is basically the Atkins' for Life plan, however the author takes some pot-shots at Dr. Atkins' then expresses the same approach right down to the 2-week induction period. If you follow this program or Dr. Atkins, you will undoubtly be successful at both weight loss and improved health. There's a lot more information in Atkins New Diet Revolution, but few reviewers actually read the newer books and always refer to the earliest version - this author does that, too. This book is actually a pretty straight forward explanation of controlled-carb eating. I gave it only one star because of the author taking credit for someone else's work."
2,Didnt work for me,"Dont waste money on this or any diet book.Just get online and use a free calorie calculator, determine how many calories you can eat and loose weight, dont exceed that and step up excercise.You dont need a book, just control how much you eat!!!!!"
2,Not Original,"The South Beach diet sounds suspiciously like Adele Puhn's ""5 Day Miracle Diet,"" published in 1996. Not very original of you, Arthur Agatston. If you buy this book, buy it for the recipes only."
2,Be wise before you buy,"Got a great deal on the book and quick shipping but was a little offset when reading due to the complicated and somewhat expensive meals. Some meals just aren't for me due to the ingredients. Like I said in my title ""be wise before you buy""!"
3,Southbeach CD review,The CD was helpful. The author did go in depth a lot about his acomplishments. More menu ideas and practical applications would have made the rating higher.
3,"Foolproof, I think not!",Absolutely I lost weight and I did it very very fast. I lost 30 pounds in 2 months(much to my doctor's horror). I did look good and it felt good getting into my size 8 pants again. But I just didn't feel right. I was lightheaded all the time had dizzy spells and from losing the weight so fast my skin looked real bad. I went off the diet and thought I could just control my carbs myself. Now I find that I have gain back 15 pounds and now I have an uncontrollable craving for certain foods that I never had before. I say this diet is not for everyone. I think the fast weight loss in the beginning is just to give you motivation to continue. I guess the book just taught me how to lose weight fast but I didn't learn how to eat.
4,seamstress,"Good book for describing diet and what to eat and not to eat in different phases. Recipes are easy to follow and at times don't even think I am on a diet. They give you a lot to eat, so there is no way you should go away hungry. Many recipes available to use so should not get bored with the same offerings."
4,South Beach Diet Works,"This book is an easy and informational read. I learned so much about food, and reasons why I have failed at weight lost before. With this book you learn what to eat and why it is good for you. First of all let me say that I HATE DIETING, but this diet was different because I did not feel limited in food choice. In one month I lost about 20 pounds! The one thing I will say is hard about this diet is that you gotta make your food ahead of time, but once you get into it it becomes easier."
2,Not comfortable for me,"This might work for some and price is certainly low, but I found it actually uncomfortable. Gave it away soon after receiving it."
2,Don't Bother,"This item was a great price and now I know why. The fan is loud. Note to self, ""You get what you pay for""."
1,Good While It Lasted,And then the cheap wiring died on me and I have to go and buy another notebook cooler. I used mine most often on my lap so the wires were being moved around frequently. If you plan to use this as a stationary cooler then its probably better. But who buys a notebook for stationary use?UPDATE: I have just been on the internet for 10 hours in search of a better laptop cooler and my final decision: I'm buying another Tripp Lite. I guess this one isn't so bad after all. I'm planning to heavily duct tape the wires to the cooler so that the wiring is at less risk of being damaged this time around. I extend my 1 star review to all laptop coolers in the world and update this review to 2 stars. THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
3,OK for small laptops.,I have a 15.4' Dell Inspiron 1526 and the pad seems to be too small. Maybe it's OK for smaller laptops but for mine it does not do a great job.
2,opcional,"Este producto no lo recomiendo, al principio era bien, pero despues de unos dias empezo hacer mucho ruido, la compre para mi lapto de 17"", pero es preferible usarlo para las lapto de 15"""
2,Cheap wire connection...otherwise good.,"The cooling pad works fine and is very silent. However, the USB power cord supplied is cheap and the internal contacts failed, rendering the pad useless. I replaced the USB power supply cable with another brand and now its working fine."
5,Does the job,"Considering the price and size, this is a great gadget. The only power source you need for it is a USB hookup to your laptop, so make sure you have a USB port to spare. My Toshiba laptop was constantly freezing due to overheating (apparently a common problem in Toshibas), and my friend suggested I get this. I've only had the freezing problem once since using this product."
4,Works well for the price,"I recently bought a 17"" Gateway laptop and realized that it got way too hot to use on my lap. This cooling pad works well for the price, but there is one flaw. I guess because my laptop is 17"" the weight of it causes it to hit the fans every now and then. It doen't cause any damage and still works perfectly fine, it's just annoying to have to reposition the laptop so it doesn't make noise from hitting the fans. Other than that it works well and is very quite. If I had a 14"" or 15"" laptop I would definately recommend this cooling pad. 17"" laptop I would look around a little bit, but if you can't find anything thats close in cost this cooling pad works fine."
2,Don't waste your money here!!,"Hi alls,I bought this item beccause I wanted to guarantee some of ""Cool Air"" on my DELL Inspiron 6400, but this doesn't work, I can see one fan rotating (It's go so Slow)One thing good that I can say about, it is so silent, but only thisBesides, It doesn't Do the JOB, It was cheap, but it's dissapointing.In Spanish...Bueno no es mucho que decir aqui, lo compre por barato y para garantizar un poco de ""frescura"" en mi DELL inspiron 6400, pero que va no funciona, es decir enciende y todo pero no creo que sea de mucha ayuda, ademas uno de los ventiladores va demasiado lento, tanto que lo puedo ver :(Una cosa buena es que es silencioso, muy silencio, pero claro me imagino que como va tan lento ni ruido hace...En resumen no es una buena compra, si alguna vez compro otro seguramente sera de otra marca quizas mas reconocida o con un mejor review."
1,junk,"been meaning to post this review. this pad lasted about two weeks for me...just a piece of cheap plastic junk that never really moved much air to start with.If your laptop is overheating first thing to do is clean your vents and make sure nothing is clogging the fans. If you still need a cooling pad, look elsewhere. this one stinks"
4,The demons yet to be released,"I have owned this album since it was first released in 1981. The purchase was a result of being a ""Boys Next Door"" fan. What a shock!! I was lucky enough to get a chance to see the Birthday Party perform most of these songs in London. This was a band to see live and gave me greater appreciation of this recording. I think their finest work and gives insite to the later work of Nick Cave. No track is as good as Release the Bats however King Ink, Nick the Stripper and Cry stand out. Certainly pushes the limits of contempory rock."
4,Soaks up and wicks the sweat,I bought the Buff to stop sweat at the gym from streaming in my eyes. This does a great job with out making me look like a seventies tennis player.
5,awesome buff,bought this for my girlfriend before our treck in Ecuador. It is very stylish and she gets complements all the time about it
3,Too thin to be of any real warmth.,"I was hoping that the headware would be a little thicker. I was planning on using it as a face cover while snowboarding. It will look cool, but will provide only minimal protection from wind. Its nice for walking the dogs on chilly winter nights though."
3,Too loose,"would be great, but fit is too loose for my (22 3/4"") head... fabric is not stretchy enough."
5,Versitle cloth,"I wear this Buff headwear to work, when I play, and even around the house. I love it when I hike or bike, and I love the pattern--have gotten alo of comments on it. I plan to buy a winter Buff."
5,"It's a Buff, What More Can You Say","I have several Buffs for various times of the year, this one is my go-to headgear when I'm backpacking in the Fall. Super versatile and highly visible, just what I wanted when outdoors during hunting season."
4,It's a freaking Piece of polyester.....,"..but it's a cool little piece of polyester cloth. I'd never pay $18 for this thing if I knew how to sew, but.... And it really does fit great, using variable methods of wearing it. In short, it rocks. I sweat like a horse, and while this can't keep sweat from eventually getting in my eyes, it really does hold that event off for much longer than without it! And it keeps dropping sweat more manageable even after that point (I use it for running)."
5,Great for racing,"I often will wear a buff when competing in 5k in the spring and fall, when it can get chilly, or on windy days. It works as an earcover/headband, to keep wind out of ears, as a neck scarf to keep warmer, or as a balakva to protect ears, neck and lower face (and if you get a runny nose, it can absorb that as well). If you practice a bit beforehand, you can figure out how to move from one configuration to another without stopping.As others have mentioned, it's not for really cold weather (there is a thermal version for that, which works very well) but it works great in every other season."
3,Not bad,"Wasn't too thrilled the ends of the material tend to roll, but all in all the product is nice. Many uses and light weight. On a hot day however if I'm wearing it over my face and have myGlasses on they tend to fog up. Still not sure if it's moreThe glasses fault or product."
5,Works Great!,"Works great, so many different options! I like that it allows you pull your hair back and adjust the style however you want it."
5,Buff,Love this product. Great for neck sun protection or for covering your head when it gets a bit cool out. Looks pretty cool too. Wore it all the way up to the summit of Kilimanjaro and plan to take it along for my future climbs.
4,Hiking head cover,"Good product, quality made, versatile (can be worn / used lots of different ways), fits well, should be handy when hiking this Summer."
5,Good stuff!,"Some people have hair to protect their domes in summer's heat and sun, I don't. So this is the next best thing. Summers in the northeast can be hazy, hot, and humid, the Buff helps with all of the above. It keeps my dome from turning beet red, keeps the sweat from running into my eyes - and the subsequent burning from the salt - and the UV helps you to not feel the sun's rays relentlessly burning down on you. I spent a large part of this summer (officially the hottest on record in NY/NJ)working outdoors, and the Buff definitely made the unbearable days easier to tolerate. It's more breathable and comfortable than my Tiley hat - sorry Tiley."
3,Hard to breathe through,"Maybe I'm not using it as intended. I bought this so I could run in the city with it. I run next to the smog-filled street and by a sewage plant on the way to the beach. When I put this on, there's definitely a huge reduction in the outside odor, but if I'm running, I can't breathe through this. If I'm walking, it's fine. I think I'm breathing just a little bit heavier than usual. I don't have asthma and I only need to put it on during the first mile of my 10mi run.I would say this is fine for hiking or light activities but if you're a heavy breather, don't use it as a mask."
5,Very Versatile,"I needed something to keep my ears warm for cycling in cold weather. A traditional stocking cap (beanie, toque, etc.) was too thick to wear under a bike helmet and this buff is perfect. It is about the weight of a thin T-shirt but It is long enough to be doubled or even rolled into thirds and worn like a headband - making it very versatile. As described, the material does a good job of wicking moisture, thus keeping ears and head warm despite its light weight. When I purchased this I didn't realize that they also make a half buff which probably would've suited my needs even better but I am still happy with my purchase as this is something that I will likely continue to find uses for outside of wearing it for cycling."
4,BUFF,This product is as advertised. The only concern I have is my foggy glasses when the Buff is over my nose.
4,Alopecia hear me Roar !!!,I love these ! The collection to choose from is amazing ! I have a really small head so the one size fits all really is true ! I get compliments on them every time I wear one and I love how many different styles you can do with them ! I would have given them 5 stars but I think they should come down in price.
4,Iron Shirt Chi Kung: level 1,"Information would be 5 stars, but video form is low quality. Deffenetly i would prefare this on dvd. too much repeating, should be faster tempo or atleast less repeats...booring.Very interesting way to visualize chi kung, much hard to find information. Even the slowlier learner will get the info ;-). Idiot proof."
3,I was disappointed with this book.,"Mr. Jephson's first book ""Shadows of a Princess"" was alternately praising of the Princess and then would tear her down so I was a bit wary of this book.I think it takes a nicer tone about the Princess this time, describing trips she made to various countries (each with it's own chapter) with Jephson in tow. For your money I find that you'll be getting what amounts to a medium sized picture book with large print text. Kent Gavin's long introduction is actually the best, most informative part of the text, Jephson puts too much of himself in his writing. The pictures, well you've seen most of them before, they're still good anyway.There are a couple of chapters at the end by other writers about traveling with Diana, also better than what Jephson himself wrote.It isn't the worst book to own but I'd still prefer Rosalind Coward's book."
2,Disappointing,"The book contains several inaccurate informations on dates and places - which is surprinsing for an author who was previously the princess's private secretary. The so called never-seen-before photos are almost none, especially if you are a serious Diana fan."
3,Careful: Photo is wrong!,The current photo is of a Type-TL fuse which has an Edison-style thread. This is different than the description which is for a Type-S fuse. A Type S has a different thread style and will not fit into an Edison fuseholder without an adaptor.
3,Not for the second time,"While after finally getting the hang of setting this thing up, it did prove to lock the smell in and the odors away. However, I found it to be very costly when it came to buying the refills and well just not worth the time. Basically if I didn't change my daughter right there in the room where the genie was kept. Then it really wasn't serving it's purpose. Overall, this may be a good product for first time parents, but as for me the next time I won't even waste my money."
1,Sitting on the closet shelf,"I have a stack of 10 of these sitting on the closet shelf, because I can't get the diaper genie to work correctly. The whole idea sounds great, but try working it and youwill change your mind."
3,Not great for controlling odors,"I don't find that the Diaper Genie is very effective at controlling odors. I started off using the Infant Refills, then switched to the Toddler Refills, thinking that might help. However, even with emptying the Genie every few days (I even rinsed out the inside once), the Genie emits some smell when you open it, and particularly when you twist it to ""seal"" the diaper."
1,Better to Buy the Champ,"Why waste money on something that you don't need? Babies are expensive enough as it is (the diapers alone are more than enough expense). I MUCH prefer the Diaper Champ over this. The Champ is easy to use, and there are no expensive refills to buy. The odor is contained quite nicely as well."
1,Get better refills,"The blue edge refills are a waste of money. They have a green edge refill marked for ""toddlers"" that is thicker and better at odor control. I recommend those even for babies. They cost the same per package. I'm not sure if they are the same length or not. They are much harder to find in stores."
4,Absolutely Wonderful!,"The Diaper Genie (and refills) from Playtex is such a nice product. The smell from the diaper pail we used previously was attrocious! This pail keeps all the odors contained inside, avoiding the embarassing smells that lingered in the past. I'm looking forward to getting a second unit for our upstairs changing area as well."
3,Great to Dull (Pharoahs Mix #6),"The opening track of this cd made me think that this was about to be a stellar cd from start to finish. That isn't exactly the case. The opening remix of POSSIBLY MAYBE is right up my alley. It is exactly the kind of thing I hoped for when I bought this cd. New, strange, oddity-filled remixes on previous Bjork tunes. Unfortunately, this opening mix ends up being the darkest track of the cd. That's not to say that it's the only good track on the cd, that's not so, but it is the highlight for me.Later on in this disc there are a couple moments that sound like Bill Laswell using a distorted bass tone. I kept waiting to hear Buckethead's guitar playing soar in over the Laswellian bass, ala PRAXIS.I give this cd 3 stars because it is indeed good, with moments of greatness, and I do not regret purchasing it, but it isn't consistently great (4 stars) or consistently fantastic and essential (5 stars)."
5,A must for techno and electronica freaks!,"This album has some of the phattest techno and jungle mixes you will ever hear. Granted, it's an extremely unique and innovative CD. So if you're into Backstreet Boys and other ""radio bands"" then this album isn't for you. But if you like hearing music that has originality and soul to it then Telegram is a must have."
4,an average work of björk,"It is not really necessary to buy but,it is a björk record.Iliked it but,the remixes in it are the most needles ones whichare in the singles of post.Although,'Possibly Maybe(Lucy mix)'and 'My Spine' are perfect,there are better björk b-sides andremixes.'Telegram' could be like this:1.Karvel2.Charlene3.I Go Humble4.Army of Me (featuring Skunk Snansie)5.Possibly Maybe (Lucy mix)6.Army of Me (Massey mix)7.My SpineI think the best songs of björk are her b-sides but,they arenot really known as much as some of her annecessary boringsongs.I don't understant why generally her some average songsare more promoted and available."
3,S'allright,This albulm has some outstanding moments and I feel it's worth wading thru the rubbish to get at it. A great one to own if you're in to mystifying your friends but putting crazy remixes on compilation tapes. Ok for any other purpose.
3,"""Telegram"" Merely Phones It In","Why take the perfect gems encased in the intricately and beautifully constructed ""Post"" and redo them? I don't know, but I do know that this superfluous release goes to show how you can mangle a masterpiece with good-intentioned remixes."
2,For BIG fans of Bjork ONLY !,"I love this artist and I was expected some great surprises with this CD, I was finally very disappointed.It is not interesting at all.Most of the songs that all fans already know and have on several records, are remixed by different people and the result is at the end, impossible to listen for most of them.It's boring and even the great Bjork melodies sound crap or nothing like the originals. It was maybe a lot of fun for them to make such a stuff but I am not sure, the fans will share this excitement.Get this Cd if you really want to collect all her releases and if you don't care what it's on it."
5,Its not a remix album,Its awesome. Different. Luv her music. Vocals. And yes. I luv luv luv Post album. Which gave birth to Telegram.
2,From ho-hum to irritating,"Like some other disappointed reviewers, I'm a long time Bjork fan (since the Sugarcubes) but have a hard time listening to this album. The remixes vary in style from sparse ambient to frenetic dance. This in itself is irritating because it means the album has no flow or cohesion. But it's the remixes themselves that drive me nuts. Overworked and trying too hard to 'do something different' with perfectly good songs, they just end up mangling them for the most part. I think you'd have to be a fan of remixes, rather than a fan of Bjork's, to enjoy this album. The only redeeming feature is the inclusion of some songs not available on other albums, such as 'My Spine'. I'd advise you to listen to all the samples before making this purchase."
4,Hyperballad alone is worth it...,"But there's a number of outstanding tracks. Most remix albums .... This one doesn't. There are some duds, to be sure, but... 'Hyperballad' is unbelievable. This is actually the cut that made me fully appreciate Bjork for the artist that she is. After I grokked this, the rest of her music made sense to me, and now I'm a huge fan. Until I heard that, I didn't think much of her music at all. Now I can't understand why it took me so long to realize how beautiful her work is..."
3,Haven't we heard this before?,"Okay, so some of the songs shouldn't have been remixed, but she didn't do it! Sometimes you shouldn't try to make something better that can't be much better. ""You've Been Flirting Again"" is definitely more heart-wrenching. The two ""Isobel"" remixes are definitely interesting. I never imagined Bjork putting any more rap than the B52's ever would. Overall, a good remix CD. Add it to your collection. You won't be disappointed, but you're not going to make it your favorite either."
4,Fast postage,Received this item in just a week and a bit. Excellent service. Just what I required for the job of rebuilding the tractor.
4,The Going Ons of a Tractor,Hi:I purchased this book for an older Gentlemen(James)he was needing a book that showed him the ins and outs of the tractor that made it work. Like the PTO which helps in lifting your inclements that work with the tractor. I believe that he has his tractor working now and I helped him in getting it put back together so that he could do some lot mowing and making a little mad money on the side.Scarlett
1,Fair,I was a little disappointed in this product. Not as complete and in-depth as I thought it would be. Much to expensive for what it is. Will not purchase another one of these items.
2,Not much help,Manual does not even cover the Basics - ie fluid capacities -maintenance and check points. Figures and diagrams not cleartoo many copies of copies - Must be a Manual for a tractor thathas been around this long - ?? I have a 135 and 165 - both withstarting injection problems and lift problems
5,Exactly what I need,We just bought a 1973 MF-165 and needed this to get it back in good shape. Thanks so much for getting it to us so quickly!
1,not helpful,does not address my situation- too little info promises a lot delivers little does not contain the iso i was looking for
4,Quality Product,"I bought them for my wife as a gift and she was thrilled. The quality is there, the finish was excellent. I wish the handles fit more snugly but they do what they advertise. Light years over plastic parts grinders."
5,Beautiful and functional!,I would recommend this to anyone who wants to buy a quality grinder that will last a lifetime. It is both lovely to look at and does the job of grinding salt to perfection.
1,hate it,"I bought this pepper grinder for my son and he doesn't use it because it doesn't grind the pepper. The grinding mechanism is made of plastic and is worn out after a couple of months. It's marked made in Greece like my original one but I think it's a Chinese knock-off.After reading eight people gave this pepper mill five starts, I am losing faith in the Amazon rating system."
1,"Decor only, Not for use.","This product is not designed to be used to grind.The quality is severely lacking. The physical wheel that does the grinding (plastic) smoothed off after only 2 or three uses.It's pretty but not worth the money.I'm disappointed though that Amazon won't let us replace it.We are good customers and as a gift for my parents it didn't get used until the expiration date had passed.I'll purchase another and hope for the best (oh, and test it thoroughly before the expiration date)."
2,Average Product!!!,"I didn't have much fun with this controller for several reasons. 1)It's small and accommodating my big hands into this controller is just impossible. 2)Some of the capabilities of the controller is just too difficult to use. 3)The D-pad and the analogs are hard to adjust to. In some games, they are too sensitive, while non-responsive with my other games. Recommend getting the controllers offered by Alienware."
2,Not Compatible with Madden '08 for PC,"I bought this gamepad to use with Madden'08 for PC, but EA's software doesn't recognize the right stick, which you need for kicking, etc. I like the physical configuration of the buttons, and can see how awesome it would be IF IT WORKED with the game--very frustrating. Despite the flexibility with configuration that Thrustmaster provides, there is no way (that I've been able to find) to redefine the right stick to work with this game. Perhaps EA will make the '09 version compatible, because they have coordinated with Thrustmaster in the past. On the other hand, EA doesn't tend to fix software problems very quickly... I'd love to know from other folks which games DO work well with this controller on a PC."
2,THRUSTMASTER WAS A DUD!,THIS CONTROLLER DID NOT WORK WITH MY COMPUTER. MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MY FAULT. IT JUST WOULD NOT WORK.
4,SAFE!,"THIS IS THE EASIEST SHARPENER I HAVE USED, BETTER THAN THE ELECTRIC ONES THAT EAT AWAY THE BLADE. IT IS ALSO SAFE: ON A SIMILAR SHARPENER WITH OUT THE PROTECTIVE SHIELD CUTS ARE FREQUENT AND DANGEROUS. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT THE CARBIDE BLADES GET DULL AFTER A WHILE.REPLACEMENT BLADES WOULD ENHANCE THE UTILTY."
4,"Well designed purge type mask, but buy the Reliance Model","This mask works great - silicone apron has no leaks. Purge valve is a must have for ease of releasing water inside the mask. But I recommend the Reliance model from Body Glove for a few dollars more. That model has a finer strap adjustment and a much larger lens. The skirt and purge is identical, just the straps and glass is much better on the Reliance model"
4,Comfortable Mask but Problems with Nose Part,"This is one of the most comfortable masks that I've worn. The silicon is soft and flexible and provides great fit. After wearing it for about an hour per day for 2.5 weeks, I never had any leaks. Purge valve works great; just exhale through your nose to clear your mask. My only complaint was regarding the nose piece. It was too big for me. It is definitely for people who need extra space for their nose. I was having a had time pinching my nose to equalize (which is why I took away a star)."
2,Watch your nose,"I purchased this mask to replace the one I used last year in St. Thomas. I figured the silicone would make it more comfortable and keep the water out better. I didn't know what to expect from the Purge Valve as I had never owned a mask with one. I tried it on and the suction is great but the hard plastic disk at the bottom of the nose piece hurts my nose. I can't imagine having the mask on for any length of time because of this, so I returned it."
2,sims 2 disappointing,"after having played other sims games for both gameboy advance and nintendo ds, i must saying this game was rather disappointing and slow. gave up because of lack of interest."
2,Does anyone really like this game at all?,"I got this game from my aunt for Christmas. I played for a while, soon to discover that it was hard and confusing. I think the time passes to quickly! I mean, I just told my sim to use the shower, and about five minutes later our time, a notice said, ""Is that smell you?"". I don't have time to let my sim shower every few sim hours. I need to treat my patient. And why would anyone want to fastforward the time in the game? It was hard for me to walk around in my house or whatever too. Just thought I would share my opinion with anyone.Read my other reviews, ""Give Dogz a chance"" and ""Nintendogs is an awesome game""."
1,The Sims 2 Pets,"Like other reviews posted both my husband and I are fans of the Sims PC games. So we figured that our 10 year old daughter would love this game. We were wrong. After tring to play the game ourselfs we found it to be borning and quite hard to grasp onto the concept of the game, esp for a younger child. I would not recommend."
2,Not like The Sims...,"It's true that this game is fun at first, but after a while it's very boring. I stopped playing it the second day. All you really do in this game is heal pets. Patients are constantly coming to your house and you have little time to get your needs up. I reccommend the regular Sims 2 DS game.Fun- 4/10Sound- 6/10Graphics- 2/10Overall- 3/10"
5,I would recomed it to everyone.,"This is a great game for all ages. Even 30year olds. It's fun and shines light on the aspects of life. You have something that tells you what your body needs. (Like Food, and rest.) This game is so good that I would recommend it to my worst enemy. The only thing is you have to read the talk bubbles. The Sims speak in their Sim blab. So, no you're not hitting the wrong languagh button. They makers of Sims games have outdone themselves again."
2,Good concept but...,"I was intrigued by the veterinary practice concept, but I was expecting it to be more like Trauma Center: Under the Knife. This game is very repetitive. Basically, all you do is give flea baths or flu and worm meds. Some people even bring their pet to you complaining that it's ugly, and you have to dress them up in a bumblebee costume or a tux and top hat. Creating your own meal was an interesting addition, but also got old quickly. There are no relationships in the game. You can only leave your house/office to go to the park to interact with other people and their pets, which means nothing because, again, there are no relationships in this game. Also your day is done at 5pm when your vet office closes, so no leisure time after work. Fortunately, after being incredibly disappointed with Sims 2 for DS, I decided to rent this one before buying it, and I'm glad I did. I'll stick with the Sims on PC."
2,Boring ! (-___-),Unless you've played the Sims before and know/like the series then this game will probably be great to you. But to someone who's never played Sims before you'll find this game horrible. The graphics are horrendous and the gameplay just isn't what I expected. The packaging can be misleading cuz by reading the back of it ... it seemed like a fun game to be a vet and care for the pets but I was more spending time going to the shower and restroom for my Sims than doing anything else. Wish I could return it cuz it's a terrible game.
3,Its OK,"I got this game such a long time ago i dont even no what i got it for!! At first it was really confusing!so i abandoned it in my drawer 4 about 3 years lol.then i decided to play it again and i really liked it!!!PROS.: Its really fun to make ur own pets and people. Ive made alot of creations in the past months lol.its also pretty fun to shop and cook. Ive bought alot of stuff latley!! i could also play this game 4 a really long time too!CONS.: It gets SUPER anoyying when thousands of people come in in one second. I almost starved to death because of that!! and its like IMPOSSIBLE to take care of the animal when its ugly, and what ever the other thing is!!other than that, its a really great game!!!P.S. this is alex's sister writing this just in case u were wondering ""what is a 13 year old guy doing playing sims 2 pets??????"" lol:)"
5,Great addition to any sims2,I installed this game and I just love it! It has quite a variety of dogs and cats to choose from or for the artistic person...you can create your own dog!
4,an okay game,"this game is just an okay game. i totally thought that this game would be soo better. its kinda like the pc games. the graphics are very good, but its not that fun. unless you want to be a vet when you grow up, its not that good."
1,Ughh,You got to be kidding me I'm 12 and this game is probally the most boring game i have pllayed in my LIFE. the graphics are crap. The game sucks&& is overlly repetitive i hate it!! DON'T buy it!
5,Daughter game,She likes it and plays with it she says its a lot of fun whicch why bought for her to have.
2,So disappointing for Sims2 fans,"I am a die-hard Sims 2 (PC) fan and also love Animal Crossing for the DS, so I thought I would like this. Unfortunately, I have found it to be extremely boring and repetitive. There's no sense of working towards a worthwhile goal in the game, the tasks are boring (curing pets of the flu, fleas, worms, dressing them in inane costumes). The creativity of the PC Sims game is completely missing (after you create your doctor and choose your pet). As another reviewer noted, cooking can be amusing. It's kind of like Cookin' Mama. Otherwise, it became so tedious that by the second day of owning the game, I stopped playing. The time passage is also problematic as you are forced to sleep when the clinic closes so there's no development of your sim or relationships. I would only recommend this game to someone who loves animals and would like to care for virtual pets."
2,Don't waste your money,"My dayughter, who loves our 'Sims' for computer game - got this for Christmas and by the end of the week she was bored... I don't think she even played it once in January... Wish I would have gotten her a different game.Don't waste your money!"
2,Not as good as the Ps2 version,"I had high hopes for this game, being a die hard sims fan. I was hugly disapponited. It was a little complicated to pick up how to cook, and how to place new furniture (I still haven't figured that out) You sim gets tired after about 2 clients, and you can only hold 3 pets (including your Own ) at once. this limits the game alot. your sim is usuallty to tired to do anything with the pets, and it gets really repeditive. I wouldn't recomend buying it, but if you really wanna try it, borrow it from a friend."
3,fun ... then boring,"I was addicted at first, but havent played it in months. Although it did come in handy when I bought my new puppy."
3,Not Your Typical Sims Game!,This is nothing like previous Sims titles for the DS. It is not like any other Sims title at all. I found it boring to be honest. You are a vet who takes care of other people's animals. Your day pretty much runs 9-5. You do not have time outside of business hours to take care of needs. There are no real goals other than reputation and money.I gave this one over to my daughter. She only plays it when she is totally bored of everything else. It is just not the quality product we have come to love from Maxis/EA Games. I have owned almost every Sim title all the way back to the very first Sim City. This is the first time I have actually disliked a game from this line.
3,Your View of This Game Will Change After Awhile...,When I first got this game I was overly eciteted. I thought I would never get bored - but after about a week it got pretty boring. This game starts off so very fun. Especialy making your sim and pet. The grafics aren't bad but their not good. If you have played past sims games for ds and gba you will notice and be dissapointed that there is no relasionship panel nor a phone.
3,A bug,"I got the Sims 2:Pets as a gift and i totally love it. But at times the screen tends to freeze up, mainly when you try to go to the grooming table. The top Left and Right buttons work but the touch screen stops working and so do the buttons, and unless you saved right before that you are pretty much screwed. Its not my DS, its the game. The game is fun but the having to start the system over isn't."
1,It's the WORST game EVER!,"Sims 2 Pets is the worst game ever. When your person gets hungry, and you don't have food, then you go shopping. But it says you have to get food by trading it with other people who also have the game. But if no one else has the game, then you can't get food. Then you starve. It's the most boring game ever."
3,Content Christians in an Age of Spiritual Poverty...,"This book is recommended for anyone who has a passion for social injustice in relation to the Christian life. I'm reading it for my Seminary class and Dr. Sider is the Professor. I recommend his book, ""Churches that Make a Difference"". Awesome book..."
2,Full of mistakes.,"When I first received the book,I was very pleased with it. However,after working about half of the problems, I grew tired of correcting the many mistakes in the answer key. The answers in the answer key were not edited at all. I believe the author should have done more homework. Not satisfied!"
3,It's OK but where are the foldables,"I had an earlier book that Dinah Zike had written about Earth Science ideas and foldables. I thought this would be the same. Since I allowed someone to borrow that book (and they never returned it), I am lost.This book isn't anything like her other book. This is like the Janet Van Cleave books. Which is are OK, but I already have 1000s of activities. I needed the foldables to go with the activities I already have.I was disappointed. But since it would cost almost half of the price of the book to return it....I just kept it and think it will be a good present for a brand new science teacher."
2,Not so many activities,"I am a certified science teacher and purchased this book to aid in teaching homeschool students. If you are looking for something with a Christian perspective with a creation basis, you need to purchase a different book. This book focuses on millions of years, has hominids in it, and assumes evolution and the big bang. The book is informative, but the activities are not very exciting if you are wanting to spark a child's interest in science. The illustrations are appropriate for middle school students and the information is presented in an easy to read format."
1,Do not buy the Troy-Bilt TB90BC,"Do not buy this trimmer. I have been struggling with it for 2 years. I takes forever to start, does not idle, uses a lot of gas I also brought it in for repair. They charged me $40. and told me that it was not worth fixing. I wish I had returned it. I only gave it one star because that was the only way I could post this comment"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought the Troy-Bilt TB90BC from Lowe's to replace an old Craftsman trimmer that finally wore out after 10+ years of pretty hard use. I liked this trimmer's split shaft design, the ability to use it as either a brush cutter or string trimmer, as well as the Troy-Bilt reputation. This is a HORRIBLE product. Although it started fine the first or second time, it quickly became difficult to start, wouldn't come up to operating speed, and had no power. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. Based on this experience I won't consider a Troy-Bilt product again. I'm going to have to replace this piece of (new) junk - but this time I'm going to go to my local lawn equipment dealer who also services the products that they sell. I may pay a little more - but being able to take it back to them for service if needed will be worth it."
1,Cuts Well/Dies Quickly,"It's been one year and I'm on my second unit (first one was replace by Lowes) and now my current one is in the shop getting the carb rebuilt. It had about 4 tanks of gas run through it before its untimely demise and was stored EMPTY over the winter. My local service center AND Troy-Bilt say that additives in the gasoline (alcohols etc) caused the issue. This seems suspicious, but even if this is the case I would expect to get a bit more life out of the trimmer before a carb rebuild is necessary. Both parties are telling me I may need a carb rebuild every year! I'm considering cutting my losses at this point and buying a Stihl instead."
1,"Looks good, but not worth it, not even slightly","I bought this product from Lowe's. I used it for about 15 minutes with the string head and was very impressed, right up until the moment that it died and would not restart. I took it back to the store, where they gave me a refund, no questions asked.I was hoping that the extra $$ compared to my previous Homelite would get me a quality product. It didn't. Based on my experience, and on the other reviews, I don't think that I will be buying Troy-Bilt again."
1,Pray it doesn't break down.,"I purchased the unit for father's day and used it for trimming a field of tall grass. I was amazed at the ease which it trimmed the grass and weeds. The second time I used the unit; it stopped idling and then it died. I then looked in the manual and checked the air filter: it was clean. The next step was to contact a ""factory authorized service center"" to take my unit to be repaired. I got a list of 10+ such centers in the greater Seattle area. Too bad that none of them would service the unit. One repairman informed me that it was not worth it for them to repair the unit and that it was just not a quality piece of machinery. He told me that may best option was to return it to the store which I had purchased it from. I followed his advice. They offered to replace it but by now I had zero confidence in any Troy Bilt product."
1,Second one died,"I bought this trimmer last year because of the good review for Troy-Bilt in general.It did started up very nicely. However, the second time I've used it (the same day), it idling slowly and died, with more than half a tank of brand new mixed fuel. Thought that it might just be a defective item. It happens. So I brought it back to Lowes and got a replacement.The second one worked very well. I've used it with the cultivator attachment and it proved to be quite powerful.For the Fall, I've followed the instruction for storage, let it runs dry . . .Took it out for the second season, started up, and it worked for five minutes before it died in the same fashion as the first one.Thought I might have done something wrong. But in looking at the review, maybe this particular model is faulty."
1,Works OK- once,"As I write this review I am running the gas tank dry prior to tossing this equipment into the trash. It worked ONCE, then the head stopped turning. There is a replacement gearbox assembly available on the company's web site for $36 plus shipping, but I would prefer to invest that amount towards a new, quality product."
1,pure garbage,"I have had this trimmer for several years, and each year its the same story.It will start, but wont run. Off to the shop for $50 fix.I've run her dry, left her full of gas. It doesnt matter.Between the ethanol in the gas which sucks water, and eats components, and this horrible trimmer, I am going with Stihl and NEVER EVER buy anything else.DONT WASTE your time and money buying this piece of junk"
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this unit last year and only used it a few times. Today I filled it with gas/oil and it started perfectly. While I was trimming some weeds I noticed the unit start to vibrate heavily, and then then engine fell off the back of the shaft. The engine still runs good, too bad it's no longer attached to the rest of the trimmer."
1,TB90BC Troy Built Trimmer,"I purchased this trimmer 2 years ago. Was pleased for the 1st season. 2nd season the head stopped turning. Contacted two repair shops for evaluation, both indicated that the ""CLUTCH"" was the problem. About $70 to repair and indicated I would only get about 35 more hours out of the unit before I had to repeat this repair. They showed me the ""STACK"" of Troy Builts they had accumulated over the past two months from customers who purchased new equipment (other brands) and added their TB90BC Troy Built to the junk pile. I just did the same and bought a Husqvarna.Troy Built does not reflect the legendary quality we think of when we think of Troy, the great Mediterranean City. This unit is Troy Built, from Mexico. About as good as a peso!!! We got NAFTA'ed. Steer clear of this product."
2,Disappointing,"Key West is one of my favorite places, so I was very pleased to discover a new mystery series based in KW. Unfortunately Mr. Leslie's skills as a writer are very disappointing. His prose is very unoriginal and cliched. The voices are stilted and awkward. The dialog seems very unreal in words and cadence. The plot lines are simple and unsurprising. Then to top it off you barely would know the setting was KW, there such a lack of sense of place. If James Lee Burke is a 10, Leslie is a 2. Compared to Key West writer Tom Corcoran, Leslie is also a very pale shadow. Sorry to be so negative, but this writing was not worth the time invested in getting to the end."
5,"Slow Dancin, Swayin To The Music","I purchased this CD for the song Slow Dancing, Swaying To The Music. It's a beautiful, sexy, relaxing song that I don't hear often enough on the radio. I waited for a sale and got free shipping. Amazon has really good offers."
5,"SURPRISINGLY GOOD MIXING JOB, TOO!","I was surprised at the excellent sound on this compilation. I'm no audiophile--just a regular Joe listening through a portable CD-player plugged in to the Auxilary jack in my used Honda Civic. But everything sounded so crisp: I could make out the drumming and back-up vocals, and the stereo spacing filled the car.For the more-than-casual fan, I feel obligated to recommend the double ""Secret Agent Man"" set (which I've had since it came out), but this one was an unexpectedly pleasant surprise."
4,"May Be Without Feathers, But Its with Humor","Without Feathers, by Woody Allen, is a witty humorous book with 15 or so short essays/stories on a variety of topics. The humor here is very funny and not dated at all. You most pay close attention as the one-liners fly off the pages. Simply hilarious stuff. Hard to believe this was released in 1975.A recommended 4 star effort!"
1,Quality declining!,"Used to love this brand. Our last dog puzzle had a missing piece, and customer service was great about replacing it. With this one, the picture is tearing from two or three pieces,even on the first use. It is hard (especially for young ones) to put together as it requires more pressure than usual. The pieces do not lay flat. The finished project curves inward despite piling on heavy books overnight. I recommend Ravensburger-a bit more pricey but much higher quality. Honestly, our last $1.00 puzzle from the discount store was far superior."
2,Shoddy Quality,I am glad I didn't pay the full amount for this jigsaw puzzle. I thought that Melissa and Doug were meant to be good quality toys. The main problem is that the pieces don't fit together easily (you really have to force them in) and some of the pieces have not even been cut apart. At least two of them had failed to make it to the cutting machine.I am disappointed with the quality of the puzzle.
5,fine collection,"CONDE LUCANOR is a medieval collection of traditional stories, put together by an irascible Spanish prince in the 13th-14th centuries. Some of there are W. European, some Arabic and some Indian (the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" and ""Taming of the Shrew"" are in here, centuries before Shakespeare and H.C. Andersen were born).This is a scholarly edition, so if you don't want footnotes, chose another edition. But the stories are good."
2,Skating on THIN Plastic,"The whole idea is great, but very thin plastic and cheap. It stated for cats up to 10lbs and my cat is 9lbs and the first time she used it, it collapsed. If it was made with some type of stronger material, I think it would of worked fine."
1,Do Not Buy This - You'll Be Sorry,"This product is a great idea, but very badly executed. It is way too flimsy. It will not hold up under the weight of even a small cat. It will move alot under the cat's weight and it makes loud crinkling noises. These are not things that make a cat comfortable to use the toilet. This will scare the cat away and make you and the cat unhappy when the cat goes somewhere else.Do not waste your money on this product.After our bad experience with this product we found the same idea in a sturdy, well made product from citikitty. I can recommend the citikitty system."
1,Not worth the money!,"I used this and it does not work. It would not hold my kitten when she was tiny, and it certainly wouldn't hold a full-grown cat. Don't waste your money! It is possible to toilet-train a cat - we've done it! - but NOT with this one!"
1,Flimsy - Get a better kind!,"My kitties made it through stage 1 without too much difficulty. However, this thing is so flimsy that stage 2 was impossible. They are not even full grown cats! I haven't given up hope on toilet training but I did toss this kit."
2,kitty toilet training,not a very durable product. flimsey plastic. it worked in theory but the cat would fall in the toilet if he stepped on the plastic.
1,TERRIBLE,This is a JOKE!!!! Not made to withstand any sort of weight at all! The poor cat needs some support at first when training and they can't even put one leg in without it collapsing. Do NOT buy for training spend the extra money to get the more sturdy ones.
1,Cheap junk!,"I was very disapointed with this item! Made out of cheap plastic, and very over priced. My cat was scared to put her weight on it when it was placed on the toilet! Don't waste your money!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"This is a waste of money. The plastic is way too thin to hold the weight of a small cat. Once your cat attempts to use this crackling, cheap, falling apart thing, you may never be able to talk him into climbing onto a toilet again. Hoping the seller is honest enough to give me a refund. CitiKitty makes a much better product and it isn't that much more expensive."
1,Worse than useless,"This won't support a cat's weight without buckling, scaring the cat. Skip this and view a how-to video for better ideas"
5,The best single source for Y2K information.,"I have read and studied many aspects of the Y2K computer date problem from many sources and find this book to be the most comprehensive. It not only describes how the problem started, but how it will probably affect all of us world wide in many ways.It is not a doomsday prophesy, but rather a complete guide of where and how computers affect us and what we might expect to happen when the millennium rolls over. It suggests senseable things we can and should do to be prepared in the event there are disruptions. There are even suggestions as to how you might profit with investments, in spite of Y2K problems.All in all it is well written and interesting to read. The type of book that once you start, it is hard to put down and once having read it, one of the few you will want to read again. I know of many who have read this book and all share my opinion. It is must reading."
1,Nothing to write home about or even tell your friends about,Not at all impressed with this book. This is all about David Stewart trying to make it big but he falls short of that expectation. Very disappointing.
5,"WELL-WRITTEN, COMPREHENSIVE, AND NECESSARY","J. David Stewart delivers just what I ordered, But I'm giving you the tip: Read this book! In his cleverly titled Y2K report, Stewart explains in non-obfuscated terms how we got ourselves into this mess, why it's too late to get ourselves out, and what we can do to ease the sting (that is, PROFIT from it if we must live through it). If you care about your money--and I know you do--then follow his sound, well-researched advice. Dump your blue chips (these companies posess the most deeply embedded, most difficult to de-code COBOL), purchase Zitel, and TAKE CHANCES! Then go buy a Ferrari."
1,A joke,"I guess you could call Wild Animus ""pioneering"" in that it is among the first of a long line of self-published, mediocre-to-terrible books foisted on the publishing world.I picked this up for pennies at a yard sale. I wish I had spent five minutes reading it before I bought it, because that's how long it took to tell that this book is terrible. Not just terrible. It's stinkeroo, hold your nose and bag before it penetrates the drapery terrible.The other significant thing about this book is that it does indeed prove that money can't buy everything, talent being one of those things."
1,Toilet paper,"This is one of the most boring, pretentious, self-important stories I think I've ever read. If the author had spent as much time developing a coherent plot line as he did in coming up with similes and metaphors, he may have had a good story as a result. It is hard to believe that this story every found a publisher, but it is not hard to see why there have been no subsequent published books by this author."
1,I really hated this story,"As stated above""Shapero unwisely uses the prologue of his debut novel to divulge the ending, so the remaining 300 pages do little more than track one man's tedious journey toward acid-induced madness.""Says it all for me. As I knew the end before i started, it was a real struggle to wade through this book. I suppose I was irritated by the main character, and his selfish drug taking and mis use of his girlfriend.I only perservered as I wanted to see how he got to his fate at the end/beginning.A book I was happy to release into the wild. I was glad to be rid of it."
1,Don't buy this book.,"This book started out ok but got old very fast. Shapero needs to hire an editor or stop writing. The scenes about acid got boring fast and so did his character Sam's antics where he dressed up like a goat. Shapero ruins his book by giving away the ending in the prologe. I got my copy for free, otherwise I would not have paid for this book and you should not either. I thought this book would get better as it went on but Shapero's characters were flat, not real, and I didn't care about any of them. Do yourself a favor and don't read this horrible book."
1,ONE STAR IS WAY TOO MANY!,"If you are seriosly considering reading this book, let me say one thing: STOP! Regardless of how fast you read you will never be able to get that part of your life back, and you will hate yourself for the incredible waste of time. This is without a doubt the absolute worst book I have ever read. I'm embarrased that I finished it but I just kept thinking, ""It's got to get better. There has to a point to this drivel."" But no. The book is just awful. The drug-addled main character is so self absorbed and unsympathetic that no one could relate to him. The writing is very choppy, written in short sentences. It just doesn't flow.The only good thing I can say about the experience is that I didn't spend any money on it. Like many of the others who have reviewed the book, I got mine for free. And it was worth every penney."
1,"it may be free, but it's still not worth it","You may not have to pay for it, but you will never be able to have those hours of your life back. This is the worst book I've ever read. I enjoy reading stories written by third-grade students more than this.I was going to leave my copy in a coffee shop for someone else to have for free, but I know believe it is my responsibility to society to ensure that it is safely destroyed before it can cause any harm."
1,poorly constructed,"At the recent Sunset Junction street festival in Los Angeles, there were scads of copies on various booths. One lady thrust a copy at me, so out of politeness, I took it. Later, I wasted an hour trying to get through it. The book is sloppily written, in a cheezy, fantastical way. Very confusing to a reader. It is hard to sympathise with the main character, who just seems crazy.Other reviewers have noted that copies of this book were also given away in other cities. Not necessarily a good sign for its prospects. Sounds closer to vanity printing, when you have this going on. Ideally, a book should spread by word of mouth about its value. Not by mass giveaways."
1,Worst book ever? Probably.,"Wild Animus is likely the worst book I have ever read. While the basic idea is good, and what drew me to read it in the first place, it gets lost under a lot of pseudo-intellectual nonsense blathered by the singularly unconvincing characters. Much of it is preachy drug-addled nonsense, and its treatment of the honorable practice of shamanism is deplorable. Lindy couldn't be more of a caricature if she tried.At best it's mildly interesting, and at worst it's overwritten, navel-gazing nostalgia for something that never happened. I'm honestly surprised a real publisher picked this thing up, instead forcing the author to publish it by vanity press, where it would be in good company with volumes of messages from angels and the memoirs of alien abductees.I wouldn't recommend it to a single soul, and the only reason I can see for purchasing it would be to prop up a wobbly table, though it might also be useful for lighting a fire at your next barbeque."
1,Self-indulgent drug ramblings,Needless to say I didn't care for this book one bit. The main character is entirely wrapped up in his drug world never to return. The main female character is treated poorly and never attempts to help herself or change her situation. I found nothing redeeming about this book at all.
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"It's the '60's in Berkeley. Lindy & Sam, awash in drugs, hook up in one of the most bizarre co-dependent relationships you'll ever read about.Lessons Rich Shapero needs to learn:1. Just because you think you have something to say doesn't mean you can write worth a damn.2. If you are going to self-publish, please spend some money on an editor!3. LSD-induced ramblings are interesting only to other people who are tripping.4. Don't quit your day job."
1,Not my cup of tea...,"Could not finish this book. Tried to read it three times (got to chapter 5, and could not get into the story), and found it pretentious, wordy, and badly in need of an editor."
1,waste of paper,"It is interesting how someone with tons of money will go insane and do something like write a bunch of nonsense, have it published themselves, and then pay people to go and give it away for free. And on top of that pay people to pretend they are protesting the book too in order to make the book look more alluring. So much money and time spent on a book of no value... is this what the world is coming to?"
2,"Mmm, LSD","Basically, a story about an acid-dropping hippie who likes to pretend he's a sheep, write spaced-out poetry, abuse himself in various ways in the wilderness, his relationship problems, and descent into madness. The sad part is, it could have been better-a decent premise that just lagged on and on to a known conclusion (""Why won't he die already?!""). Same goes for the characters, unused potential. It has discouraged me from dropping Acid, though. I give it 1.5 stars, 2 maximum."
1,Book club said thumbs down!,"Our book club discussed this book because we received it free! Even being free, the book was not worth reading! I think the publisher spent way too much money promoting and not enough time reviewing!"
5,a little something different,"Conservatives beware! This is a book about people who willfully choose not to follow the straight and narrow. I guess you could treat it as a cautionary tale (don't want to give it away, so I'll leave it at that), but it's so much deeper than that. A book of ideas-and what some might deem ""dangerous"" ones. I loved it!"
5,Shapera explores inner truth,"This is the author's first work, and it shows--Wild Animus is fresh, exciting, raw and animalistic. His writing style is refreshing and flows well, he really drew me into his characters thoughts and feelings. Ransom is complicated and a bit idealistic, while Lindy seems just to play off the love and stand by him. Women who have read this say they don't like her very much, but I think that it keeps the focus on Ransom and his connection to nature, while remaining accurate to the time period, late 60s/early 70s. I would recommend this book for something new and interesting."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you're a fool for drugs and getting high, you might ""get"" this book. Otherwise it's totally ridiculous. It made me think about all the losers I knew in the 60's and 70's. I wonder if this is more about Shapero's real life as he left college instead of just a story. Don't bother with this book. It never should have been published."
1,Do Not Read This Book!,Please note that before you read any more of this review that it does contain a spoiler this is done for a very good reason to save you the effort of reading this book all together. This book is about a man who gets high on drugs then he dresses like a Mountain Goat from head to foot (yes I said Mountain Goat) and goes into the wilderness where he gets eaten by a pack of wolves. From what I can tell the author of this book was trying to portray the power of the wilderness but it was lost in the stupor of a dug induced banter that made no sense at all. Please do not read this book do not recommend it to friends and if you happen upon it walk away quickly so that you are not tempted to even pick it up.
1,i had to open the car window; it stunk so bad!!,"Luckily I received a copy for free during the Art on the Green festival. Author Shapero should invest in psychotherapy or at the very least a dictionary. He seems to be permanently lost in metaphorville. His strange mixture of opposing adjectives and adverbs has left me confuzzled (direct quote)! Mr. Shapero's prose would be better served in art critiques. In short, it was simply baa - aa - dd ram writing! You really do get what you paid for."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"Okay, if you haven't already gessed, this book is bad. The one star is simple there because I could not go any lower or leave it blank. The characters are annoying and pathetic; the story line weird and sad, but not in a cool way. I got this book for free (that should have told me something)and have yet to see a ""good"" review. To paraphrase GK Chesterton, ""a good book reveils the truth about the character, a bad one reveils the truth about the author."" Dear Mr. Shapero, I think the truth is that you were not meant to be a writer. But to end on a positive, the description of the Dahl sheep was accurate."
1,awful,"Like everyone other review, I agree this book is awful. It was sitting on my bookshelf for 2 years before I read it. It was free and I had read all the other books I own. II managed to finish it, and when I was done, I threw it at the wall. Never has a book frustrated me more.For your own sake, don't read this piece of junk."
1,Trying too hard to be meaningful,"I received a free advanced reading copy (ARC) of this book and managed to read it all the way through, which was a chore. I seldom have trouble finishing books, even when I don't like them, but this one was tough. Clearly the author is trying to convey his vision of enlightenment, but his vision is so bizarre and the writting so stilted that I find it simply impossible to grasp the author's message or sympathize with his characters. The drug induced ""vision"" sequences are especially difficult to read, and they drag the entire narrative to a crawl. I wish I could find something good to say about this book, as I'm sympathetic to the struggles of a new author, but I simply can't find anything I liked about this book.This review is based on a pre-publication Advanced Reading Copy (ARC) of this book."
1,an insult to the mind and earth,"Stopped reading after less than 100 pages; agree w/other reviewers that I have never before read such trash, let alone such self-indulgent trash. The author should be required to purchase carbon credits to replenish the earth after having actually felled trees and used water to produce paper on which to print such garbage. The next best thing would be to compost it! I wanted to give it 0 stars, but you have to award at least one to be able to post a review. This author should not be allowed to so totally waste any resources, regardless of whether he's using his own, on such efforts, ever again."
1,Gross,"I, like many others, received this book for free. And it is horrible! If you want real adventure, don't look here. Go Youtube ""The REAL Desert Dogs"" or something. At least you get some substance to the adventure.I can probably walk blindfolded into a Barnes & Noble, accidentally stumble into the kid's section, and pick out a random book there that is much more meaningful then this."
1,It can't be denied: This book is terrible!,"Like everyone else, I got this book for free and I regret accepting it. This trash is so wordy that it is impossible to read. There are rediculous metaphores, bland dialogue, and bombastic description galor. It seems like Shapero tried to show off his vocabulary, but that ended up exacerbating the problem because now you'll need college text-books to understand some of the stuff they're talking about. How awful. I really tried to get through it. Really, I did! But I just couldn't get any farther than chapter 7 (There really is no point in reading this book because the story is ruined on the first two pages!!!!!). Rich Shapero must be quite the fool.If you want to have anything to do with this book, I suggest reading the amazon.com reviews. They are WAY more entertaining than this piece of garbage."
2,My 2 cents,"I only read this book because I received a free copy of it. Although the price was right, it was not worth the time it took to read it. It's silly quasi-mystical claptrap. But the book did become a bit more interesting once I started imagining Will Ferrell playing the lead character of ""Ransom"". There's just something amusing about picturing Will Ferrell jumping from rock to rock, pretending he's a ram."
4,Certainly not for everyone,"By handing the book out for free, all over the US this summer, the author put his book into the hands of a lot of people who this book is not intended for and who won't like it. That is a shame. It is a strange story, no doubt about it. The main character becomes obsessed with the idea that he is actually a ram and supplements this w/ a good deal of LSD use, dressing up in a Ram outfit and tripping all over the Alaska mountains. His girlfriend thanklessly supports his self centered adventure. Those around him seem to almost worship him for some unknown reason. The overall interaction of the characters makes more sense when you keep in mind that it is set in the 60's. Those who are uncomfortable with literature outside of the mainstream should probably pass on this one; those who like to explore the fringes would appreciate Wild Animus."
4,"Calling all thinkers, lovers, adventurers, travelers...","Pay no attention to the negative feedback on WILD ANIMUS--its genius! even if you dont agree with the drug use (it is NOT essential or even THAT prevalent) or the ideology developed in the story, you can gain a lot from this book...It is one man's self journey which takes him to Alaska (a really beautiful and exciting setting for the story) and as the main character ""connects"" shall we say with nature, he learns a lot about himself and his life...I think that if you love nature, the outdoors, adventure or are a thinker, philosopher, seeker, you will enjoy Wild Animus just like I did. Buy it!"
1,Don't buy this book!,"Unfortunately, I can't give this book ZERO stars because the minimum is one - actually, I'd give it NEGATIVE stars! I received a free copy of this book a year ago and did my best to try and get through it, but I just couldn't do it, it's got to be the WORST book I have ever read. I can't even tell you all why in more specific terms because I've done my best to eradicate from my memory the disgust I felt at having read as much as I did."
1,This book is terrible.,"I receiving a copy of this book for free, luckily, otherwise I would feel I had wasted my money.This book follows a young man in his early 20s, Sam Altman, in his quest to find his place in the world. He becomes obsessed with becoming a ram (Dall's Sheep, not your typical barnyard variety) and drags his overly devoted girlfriend, Lindy, about the country in his pursuit of his dream.The main character, Sam, comes across as being psychotic rather than a man who follows his beliefs to find himself, which is what seems like the author was attempting to do. He is not particularly likable, and becomes less so as the novel progresses. The excerpts from the novel he's writing are dry and sometimes religiously fanatical.There is nothing redeeming about this book. Save your money and buy something else."
1,I wish they had something less than 1 star as an option,"Horrible. They were handing this book out for free on street corners in Chicago a couple of summers ago. I paid too much. I actually warned other people from accepting the free book. The energy expended to carry it was too high of a price. I tried to be open minded and give the book a chance. I made it about half way through and I could not force myself to read more than a single page at a sitting.Here are the basics of the book. Some guy does a lot, and I mean a lot of acid. He thinks that he can turn into a goat, or maybe he actually does turn into a goat. I couldn't tell and I didn't care. Oh, and there are some other completely ridiculous characters involved.Just really bad."
1,Kept thinking it must get better or why would it exist?,"Like several other reviewers, I read the whole cussed thing thinking it must get better sometime. Otherwise why would it even be in print? Alas, no such luck. However, it does make a wonderful warning to would-be authors - there is obviously not one good book in everyone."
1,blech,"The writing IS NOT GOOD. It is flowery, bombastic, and composed largely of metaphors. This was published by a VANITY PRESS and obviously there was very little editing involved.This is the first book I've ever thrown away in disgust. Thank goodness it was free. The ""exciting ideas and themes"" mentioned by some other reviewers are nothing but mad ravings explored for FAR too many pages.I was looking forward to this book because I'm from Alaska, and I love reading good Alaskan literature. This book has NOTHING TO DO WITH REAL ALASKA. Eugh. It gives me the shivers just thinking about it.Please, please read some good Alaskan literature instead! TWO IN THE FAR NORTH is a good place to start, and TWO OLD WOMEN is good too."
1,Worst Book Ever,The worst book ever. Similar to dipping a sewing needle in Tabasco sauce and skewering your nuts like martini olives.
1,We got this book for free and it was a ripoff.,"Someone, I think the author, was handing this out at the Fremont Outdoor Market this weekend.My wife and I did a quick review of the book and were unable to get beyong the first couple paragraphs.Quite frankly, I am suprised that the book was published. It must be a vanity press.At any rate, don't waste your money or your time."
1,Most despicable protagonist I have ever read,"Since the author tells us in the first few pages, I'm not spoiling anything, the main character dies. I couldn't be happier that the world, even though it's a fictional world, is rid of this jerk. Some free spirit this pud is. Having is girlfriend/wife work two jobs so that he can dress up in a goat's outfit and drop LSD in the mountains of Alaska. He also suckers friends in providing dangerous transportation and support while he hauls his ridiculous costume up the slopes. Hey, I'm all for dropping out and living the ""free"" life. But do it on your own time and dime pal. I see where the author is donating the proceeds from this piece of trash to some Alaskan conservation fund. Let's hope that ""Ransom"" isn't in charge."
1,Just couldn't get into this one...,"I, like everyone else in the world, got this book for free in Santa Monica.I tried to like it. I really, REALLY did. I got abotu halfway thru it, and just can't get up the energy to finish it off. It was a bit too far fetched and odd for me. I like the 60's era, and only being 29, I can tell the author didn't live through it. The writing seemed forced at times, and just never seemd to go anywhere.You might like it. It seems peopel either love or hate this book.Jeff"
1,There is a reason they were giving it away,as many of the other reviews stated I received an advanced copy as well. As someone who loves to read I felt I had been bestowed a wonderful gift. Little did I know it was really a horrible trick. Someone was trying to get me to trudge through this unreadable novel. I wonder if the people handing it out knew how bad it was. Were they relishing the fact that now unsuspecting people were going to waste precious time reading or rather trying to read this novel.
1,Why...?,"Like nearly all of the populous this book was given to me for free on campus. I have no idea what happened here and how it happened. Did the publisher recieve the wrong order, print a billion copies and then decide they might as well give them away. This book is absolutely terrible. The diction is over the top, Shapero tries so hard its funny while at the same time it hurts to read such garbage. At this point I would classify Rich Shapero as the Ashlee Simpson of fiction and I think we should all petition for him to retire from the writing profession.Frankly, Shapero can grab a sheet of acid and run away to Alaska, just as long as he keeps his worthless dribble too himself. As writing major and college student in general I can't even comprehend how this book got published. There is only one question...why? Although as many reviewers noticed this book is exceptionally good for anything but reading and it was free."
1,"Good idea, terrible execution","All in all, the plot in this story was interesting--a quest to find the inner self that ends in self-destruction in Alaska... It could have been made good, except that it was so BAD!Shapero's writing style reminds me of a horrible dime-store romance novel, in which he tells us rather than shows us, and leaves nothing up to us to debate about. His characters are cheesey and unrealistic, and his main female character is inconsistent and offensive to women. I did not read the prologue (I guess I didn't see it), so the ending wasn't completely ruined for me, but I went back and read it after I finished, and it would have been much better as an epilogue.Truly bad bad writing. Although I think I will have to read it again... One reviewer suggested reading it imagining Sam/Ransom as Will Ferrell... that cracks me up...Overall, this book wasn't worth the nothing I paid for it."
1,LOSER!,This was one of the worst book I have ever read. I only finished it because it was given to me as an advanced reading copy and I needed something to read while hitting the treadmill at the gym. I would give it ZERO stars if Amazon would let me.The author makes light of Christianity and the protagonist is always on LSD.Basically the guy takes advantage of his wife so that he can climb around Alaska pretending to be a Dall ram. Corny idea and stupid plot.
1,"Read Krakauer's ""Into the Wild"" Instead!","I received this book for free. I read the whole book, and hated almost every minute of it. The plot idea is great, but Shapero drops it with unbelievable dialogue and impossibly bad poetry. There are so many good images in this book and idea of taking a mythopoetic journey into the spiritual world is fabulous, but it just doesn't come together. Shapero should hire a good editor to help him turn it into a publishable novel.I recommend Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer instead. It also treats the story of a young man who takes a solo journey into Alaska. This is a tragic true story. Please note that I am not normally a fan of non-fiction."
1,BEST LEFT AS ROADKILL,"I found this book in a street gutter. It had obviously been run over multiple times as the spine was destroyed and tire tread marks were displayed prominently on the cover.I normally have sympathy for such books and am against book destruction and have been known to do the repairs myself. But after I read the first few chapters, I discovered that the proper place for the book WAS under the wheels of a semi truck. I returned the book the next day happy to see it ground into the pavement and eventually disintegrated."
3,a few kind words for wild anumus,"yes, not the perfect book, and i can understand why some/most readers would be even pissed off. i listened to this book in its audio format, and i strongly believe this format is so much superior for it; the vivid scenes come to live aided by the incredible job Peter Coyote is doing here narrating, especially rhe ""ram"" scenes, in which he switches into a raspy, chanty voice that carries you into the dream state.not sure if same effect would carry into the printed form, but for those of you facing daily commutes of more than half an hour, give it a shot!"
3,A thorough treatment. But too difficult,"Maybe this is the only book which treats ""Large deviation"" so thoroughly and so rigorously. Many other books cite this one for further details. However, this book is very difficult to read. People, like me, with graduate level probability knowledge, will still feel difficult to follow. It is not all due to the presentation of this book. It may partially because the ""theory of large deviation"" itself is not in a good shape. So this book is not good one for self-study but might be a good reference."
2,Beautiful setting.,"Beautiful ring setting, but didn't like the stones, particularly the blue one. It was too flat on top and looked like plastic. Too bad, because the setting is first class. Hated to send it back, but couldn't live with the stone."
4,Pretty nice,"I like the case except the edges are grey when you have the phone on its back, which makes it look cheap but that's ok. But otherwise, it fits and is pretty."
4,a must for those interested in our indian history and culture,"The Funderburks put together a great book. It contains more detailed information on the southeastern indian culture, artifacts and symbolism than any book that I have read for the average layman."
2,It says on the description that it is leather bound but it is only a hardback. I wouldn't have paid $30 for a hard back book.,It says on the description that it is leather bound but it is only a hardback. I wouldn't have paid $30 for a hard back book.
1,Buy something better,"I have done a lot of archery throughout my life and I have to say that these are probably some of the worst arrows I have ever seen and used. The fletchings are super cheap and rip easily off, one was broken when it was delivered. The points are also cheaply designed and ready to break off. These were 15.00 dollars plus shipping so they are definitely not worth 6-7.00 dollars an arrow. I would have given them a zero star rating but it would not let me."
4,Interesting First-person Account of an Almost Forgotten Era,"Fascinating autobiography that really revs up when discussing how he and Wilson sold WWI and the aftermath of that effort including the falling out with Wilson and his policies. Reveals a real patriot that has been forgotten. When read in the context of the current war on terror and the, candidly, pitiful attempts at explaining our policies and values to the wider world, this book should be a wakeup call."
4,Intelligence and cynicism with a beat,"AN excellent follow-up to Kramer's ""Secret of Comedy."" Another slice of a macabre and dada-esque world. Few albums capture the absurdity that life sometimes offers quite as well as does a Kramer compilation. His lyrical chanting may drive the uninitiated batty- but listen and learn from the master of dark humor."
2,Buggy as all get out,"When I first got this machine, the TVGOS software wouldn't let me schedule more than eight programs to record. Toshiba technical support tried to tell me that this was by design. It isn't. You can get past the eight program limit by performing certain voodoo rituals, after which it'll stop deleting a random program each time you store a new one.But after that, it continued to periodically forget various items that I'd programmed for regular recording. They'd just vanish from the menu of scheduled recordings.A few weeks ago, it lost the titles of all of the shows that were stored on the hard disk. This should have been a hint.Last night, it corrupted its own hard disk while I was deleting programs and lost everything that was recorded on it.At least a VHS recorder can only destroy one tape at a time.On the other hand, when it works, it's really nice. If only it worked correctly..."
5,Ok... so you can hear the fan,"The fan is noticable, but the benefits of this machine far outway the slight noise you'll hear in the still quiet. 250 GB hard drive lets you record regularly on several programs and not have to worry about deleting right away. Free TV Guide downloaded within hours and I don't have to pay for TIVO monthly service. Plus... my girlfriend and I have countless hours of camcorder footage that we wanted to edit onto a DVD. The onscreen editing feature allows you to record the segments you want to the hard drive and then transfer easily to the DVD. It's everything I ever wanted in a DVR. I highly recommend it."
3,There May be Better,First - Toshiba has stopped making this model. Anything you buy now is left over stock.I have had mine for a year. I like it but am not happy. I am connectedto Comcast cable. They do not pass the TV Guide data thru their digitalMotorola box. The TV guide on the Toshiba is usless to me because Ican't get the data from the digital box.Once in a while it locks up. You have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it back to working again. As I understand you can call Toshiba and complain about the lockup and they will mail you disk with a firmware upgrade that MIGHT fix the problem. 1-800-319-6684 I called and got mine sent yesterday. If you go to the setup menu and select the last option on the top right of the menu (has an icon of keys) look down at the bottom of this list and there is a software revision number. If its 1100 or above the firmware upgrade is of no use to you.
1,difficult to use,not user friendlyhave yet to get the tv guide to workturns itself off in the middle of watching programs
1,Block Noises,"I bought this yesterday. When I try dubbing from HDD to DVD-RAM, Block Noises often appear."
1,no useful information at all. don't waste your time and money,"I bought this book hoping to get some information of POF. But this book does not even provide basic info and help!! It listed a lot of similar stories of people, without mentioning any scientific analysis and medical advice on any case. It just tells you how they find out they have POF--missing periods, then blood test lead to POF. 90% of the book described how depressed the victim become. It's a whining and depressive book. Another point is this book is out of date. It didn't include any recent research on finding and curing POF. It highly recommends HPT. But as we know, HRT becomes more and more controversial as the research develops.The book just repeats the same contents with different names with different ages.BTW, you only need to pay $10 at their website [...]"
5,Excellent Resource of Stories,The book shares stories of women with POF and it helps you feel like you are not the only one in the world who has this condition. I wish this was available when I was diagnosed! It would have saved me months of doubting and crying. I recommend this to anyone who has POF or knows someone who does.
1,Not helpful,"The ad for this book said it would be positive, give hope, and be informative about Premature Ovarian Failure. It did not meet any of those expectaions. It is merely poorly written notes written my women about their experiences with POF. None of the stories gave any real insight,information or hope. I bought this book with the intention of giving it to my daughter who was just diagnosed with POF. Instead I threw the book away so I'd be sure she did not read it."
5,If you like Drag Racing,"If you like Drag Racing you might like this one and watch some Wild wheely standing and tony Christian act like a jack ass in it butt it is a good one to get. If you know them there is Mike Moran, Rick Dyer, Bruce Kimmen, Annette Summer, Tony Christian, Steve Carrier. over all it is a good racing video."
4,The Fundamentals Covered Well,Assigned reading for a 1 year automitive tech program. (The only text for the entire 1 year program.) Learning a lot. Chapters are very readable and seem to be complete in their coverage of their topics.
2,I Thinks Not,"I got this blender as a gift off my wedding registry 2 years ago almost. I would say I use it once a month tops to make a smoothie. However the time has come to get a new one. I always use it to make smoothies, nothing else. The past year or so I have to stop it and stir the fruit and ice cream myself! over and over. It only works well if you add way more liquid than you really want. Bummer.Also, as it nears it's second year with us the motor makes strange noises and there is even a smell to go along with it if you leave it running for too long. Probably blow out my power on set ablaze if I did leave it on. It also leaks through to the base! So you wash it, still see a ring of whatever you made so you almost always have to take it completely apart.Yes, this blender is cute but def not worth the money! I will be throwing mine out soon and going with another brand all together."
2,"Looks great, works OK ... until it dies!","OK, I admit it. I bought this blender because it is SOOO cool looking, and it was on sale for $34.95 at Target. The sealed 5-speed control panel that displays the speed setting with cool blue lights is 1000% better than the clunky multiple-button system used on most blenders. And it worked like a champ for about four months - and then just died. I called Hamilton Beach and they sent a replacement. It too died after four months! So, cool blue lights notwithstanding, this is a model to avoid. Pity, because it looks so cool!"
1,Short Life Span,"I bought this blender a few years ago. It quit working after about 11 months. I contacted Hamilton Beach and they told me to cut off the cord and send it to them with $15 and they would send a new one. A couple of weeks later, the new blender arrived and I was thrilled. About two months later, the new one quit working as well. I contacted Hamilton Beach again, but never heard back from them. I've been using my Magic Bullet in it's place, but I really want a full size blender. Any suggestions? I sure don't want to waste any more money on this blender, even though it was great while it worked!"
2,Leaky!,"As everyone else has said, it is a cool looking blender and the night light aspect is neat too. That said, it leaks from the bottom, so no matter how tightly you screw the container onto the base, you're left having to sponge off the bottom of the unit and the top of the base. Messy and kind of a pain. :-("
4,GREAT customer service,"It used to be that a blender would last me several years with no problems but over the last 2 years, I purchased 3 blenders from 3 different manufacturers, only to have them crap out shortly after purchase. When I bought this blender, I made sure it had a guarantee of some sort. After 9 months, this blender stopped working. [...]It works well for making my smoothies & shakes, looks good on my counter & I appreciate a company that stands behind their products."
1,Fabulous Until It Breaks...TWICE,"My mom bought me this blender as a house warming gift. I will admit I love that it glows and it is a gorgeous blender all together. However, it won't last very long. Within a month it stopped working completely. I contacted Hamilton Beach and told them it was a gift, I only had it a month and they sent me a replacement. Well, two months later that one has stopped working as well.Looks really cool and works great for a very short time!"
2,A bad choice...,"I bought this blender to replace my aging Hamilton Beach blender. What a huge disappointment this is. First of all, I seriously doubt that this unit is 800 watts. This machine bogs down at the slightest resistance, such as bananas, and ice nearly stalls it. My little old machine crushed ice without a whimper and it was 350 watts. So don't believe the power claim. Also, the unit leaks. When you pour the contents of your blending into a glass, some of the contents come out thru the bottom ring.I consider this an expensive night lite for the kitchen. Just an awful buy decision on my part. Don't make the same mistake I did. This is NOT a good machine in any respect."
1,Do not buy this,"Do not buy this junk. After just a few uses, the blender failed and would not turn on. The manufacturer customer support is horrible. They acknowledged that the unit failed, but would only replace the 4 week old blender if I paid the shipping. They do not stand by their products; if they had, I would have accepted the replacement and assumed this failure was an exception.On a positive note, Amazon return was hassle-free, and they accepted responsibility and paid the return shipping. Amazon, keep your great reputation and do not sell H.B. products."
2,Cool blue lights ... but it lasts only a short time!,"OK, I admit it. I bought this blender because it is SOOO cool looking, and it was on sale for $34.95 at Target. The sealed 5-speed control panel that displays the speed setting with cool blue lights is 1000% better than the clunky multiple-button system used on most blenders. And it worked like a champ for about four months - and then just died. I called Hamilton Beach and they sent a replacement. It too died after four months! So, cool blue lights notwithstanding, this is a model to avoid. Pity, because it looks so cool!"
4,Read THE WASP FACTORY,"A very good book, but since I'd already read The Wasp Factory (by Banks) infailed in comparison. the Wasp factory is twisted, sick, intriguing, and surprising. A damn good book. But so is The Bridge so buy 'em both."
3,A Bad Day at the office,"I think that Iain Banks would have to admit that this was not among his stronger stories, the writing is still excellent, and his prose is amongst the best of his contemporaries, but the Bridge requires too much concentration to be a truly engaging read. The theme seems borrowed from Irvine Welsh's Marabou Stork nightmares and although the coma world is elaborately constructed it seems a little too predictable and immediately lacks the suspense of Welsh's work. It is difficult to read, I wonder if this might have benefited from tighter editing, or a more interesting plot. Banks has certainly not lost his Midas touch, but perhaps there is evidence at last that he is only human afterall. Read it but don't expect another wasp factory."
2,Inventiveness is relative,"I'm an avid science fiction reader, which is how I came to read this non-science fictional book by Mr. Banks. Of course, since most of the action takes place in a highly unreal and allegorical world born of the mental difficulties experienced by the protagonist, it might easily be marketed as fantasy, if not science fiction.If you aren't used to the SF field, you may find the inventiveness here quite astounding. If you are familiar with SF, however, you may be looking for more than just inventiveness, and it is here that I think this book, like many others written by Banks and marketed in the regular fiction area fails miserably.I do in fact read non SF books, like those by Carver, Powers, and Pynchon, but the writing here does not measure up to these heavyweights, and as an SF book it is weak indeed. Check out my listmania list guide to books I =love= by this author."
1,Disappointing,"This book had some real possibilities, but in the end it tied none of its loose ends together and the ""real"" story was very mundane. Add to that a real cheat of an ending and you have nothing but an empty and contemptuous feeling for an author who should know better. Don't bother."
1,"Ah yes, The Bridge","What can one say about a novel that only appeals to people so pretentious that they think anything incomprehensible is a work of genius.Ok, I admit, I get the story. I just don't think the rather simplistic tale he's telling really justifies the baroque prose. Finnegan's Wake this isn't..."
5,Stupid funny,Hands down one the of funniest shows on MTV rob dyrdek shines in this show. Along himself is is funny friends and family members which makes it even better.
4,"very fine recordings, presentation lacking.",The Original Dixieland Jazz Band was an historic group that played an important role in the early recording of this medium. The present cd's are very fine and present a varied number of their recordings. What is missing is some form of historical data on the records in this set: data on the recordings; date of issue; listing of the individual members of the group. I'm sure that the personnel had changed from 1917 to the later rercordings. Two short paragraphs is insufficient to back up these important records.
5,Critical Pedagogy: An Education Experience,"Critical Pedagogy is an amazing book filled with one teachers personal experiences throughout the years. These stories are relatable and let future educators realize that not all teaching experiences will happen as planned or visioned. This book offers real life experiences of different situations that most educators will face. This book is a great example of how we must experience things ourselves and then change that expereience into a new one (Wink). This is done as you read and realize that the defintions will not be defined for you, but as you let go and read on the definitions are described in anecdotes and stories described by Joan Wink."
4,A Must Read for Anyone Entering Education,"I thought that Joan Wink's Critical Pedagogy was well-written, easy to read and extremely thought provoking. By using a lot of personal experiences, she really drives home the idea that only through understanding and accepting our own personal experiences can we find the courage within to find our own critical pedagogy. Dr. Wink is able to find the right balance of academia, to satisfy those who want definitions, and story telling, to keep it easy to read. But, don't be mislead by the easy read, because there's a lot of important information about the different methods that can be found in today's classroom. Dr. Wink's book is all about learning them all, using your own experiences to find what works best for each individual."
5,Critical Pedagogy,"When I purchased this book for one of my classes I wondered to myself, ""What is critical pedagogy?"" This book does a fantastic job of defining and describing what critical pedagogy is in a multitude of ways. Critical pedagogy is the interaction between teaching and learning and means to name, reflect, and act. This book is easy to read and contains mounds of information that will make you think critically. My favorite part of this book is Dr. Wink's use of examples and stories throughout the entire book. The stories really grabbed my attention and made me grasp the major concepts. The ""notes from the real world"" show that teaching is going to be challenging, but at the same time very rewarding and as a teacher you have a chance to make a difference in the real world."
4,Critical Pedagogy,"Critical PedagogyWe all go into teaching in hopes that we make a profound impact on children's lives, right? This book provides insights to what actually takes place inside as well as outside of school walls. Pedagogy means an interaction between teaching and learning. Critical Pedagogy is to name, reflect, critically, and act it out in a way that is meaningful to you as well as to your students. The book discusses 3 big ideas of teaching and that each one has its own style or method.This book gave excellent examples of real life stories that are heartbreaking and you want to help each child that presents their problem. It was an easy book to read but had so much information that is given between these pages. It taught me the 3 big ideas and which way would be most beneficial for myself as well as my students. I know that this is a book that I can come to and reference whenever needed. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did"
4,Not just another text book,"When I found out I had to purchase another text book I was less than thrilled. I had the same feeling, as I always do, about text books: more money down the drain for a book I MAY read once. However, I was pleasantly surprised that when I began to read Critical Pedagogy, I did not feel as though the information was dry and was trying to be shoved into my brain. I really enjoyed the stories throughout the book; Dr. Wink incorporated personal stories, stories from the classroom and stories from her experience in the classroom. For me personally, learning lessons about pedagogy and teaching came easier to me by this method. This book is one that I do not plan to sell back because I can see myself using it for reference and motivation when I began teaching in the classroom."
4,Reflect on this...,"In this world of high stakes testing, Dr. Wink is here to remind us that students still matter. This vibrant and creative text is full of Winks' own treasured experiences as well as the voices of renowned theorists and authors that have shaped the world of critical pedagogy today. Her passion for the subject of critical pedagogy and compassion for the students, families, teachers and communities involved in today's assembly line style education is reflected in the stories she shares within the pages of this book. She encourages the transformation of test-driven classrooms into student inspired learning centers. Wink also calls us to action, ""The history of critical pedagogy continues to evolve; it is not a product, it is a process of development, and each person reading this page is part of the development."" (page 117, Wink, 2005). Education is dynamic and we mustn't become stagnant, we all must be part of its continuous transformation."
4,Critical Pedagogy,"What I learned from reading this book: Critical pedagogy is messy. It takes time and work. It is the struggle that adds to the value of reflection. It is the confusion that leads to order. Before we can experience the ""order"" we must go through the frustration of confusion. Critical pedagogy involves reflection that ""sees beyond."" There is sometimes so much to ""see beyond."" It can at times be overwhelming. We need times to see the ""big picture."" ""Why"" we are doing something becomes more important than ""how"" we are doing something. Critical pedagogy is about thinking, reflecting, negotiating, and transforming relationships. It simplifies, yet does not trivialize. It attaches symbols and language to what we already know, but had no way of expressing. It hooks experience to thoughts. Critical pedagogy is narrative rather than descriptive. Stories provide flesh to the structure of our communication. In the process of sharing our lives we ""learn, unlearn, and relearn."""
5,"Elese Saia--Modesto, CA","I enjoyed this book. I was surprised by how easy it was to read. There are so many examples from Dr. Wink's past, that it makes the book become real. This book makes you think: Can there be another way of doing things and still get the same results? Many of us are products of the Behavorist Model. This book was written to challenge what we know as absolute. It teaches us that there is not just one or two ways to view something; there could be three or four. The best thing about this book is the fact that Dr. Wink exposes her own faults and misconceptions and shows us what she learned as a result of the interactions with her students. Above all, this book reiterates the fact that as teachers, your students will teach you many things just as you will teach them many things. This book was required in my class, but after reading it, it became more of a trade book than a textbook. Now I understand why Dr. Wink wants everyone to sit back, relax, and just read."
5,It is understandable!!,"Critical Pedagogy: What the heck is it? Why would you want to do it? Do I really need to do another new book on how to teach?All of these questions I asked myself before I got this book. I would have to say after reading this book I now understand what it is, why I would do it and I really do want this book on my shelf as a soon to be teacher. This book tells the what, why, how and where of critical pedagogy. It is a much needed resource. The book has true to life examples for those who need to see how it affects people. Wink is very excited about Critical Pedagogy and it shows through her book."
5,Powerful Pedogogy -- Made Accessible,"For many years I have felt frustrated with the injustice and bias in the educational system. Reading this book helped me see that I can be an agent of change and that it is possible to help young people find a sense of agency as well. Based on the theories and practices of Paulo Freire and other educators, Wink shows readers that teaching and learning are political acts, and she inspires readers to change and be changed by the process.Wink combines great storytelling and clear examples to make the theories of critical pedagogy come alive. With chapters like ""What in the World is It,"" and ""How in the World Do You Do It"" this book makes critical pedagogy understandable and accessible. A must read for all progressive educators."
1,Pedagogical jargon,"Similar to the class this book was used for, ""Critical Pedagogy"" is full of pedagogical jargon. We are trying to teach students actual knowledge, not some far-fetched fantasy that only those in ""higher education"" will understand.How many times did Wink say that she cannot define ""critical pedagogy""? Then why would she write a book about not being able to define it?"
1,I can't believe this was used in a university level class.,I can't believe that this was used in a university level class. This book was more the author's ramblings than information. She spends pages musing.Completely useless! I seriosly question the judgement of faculty/administration that approve the use of this book.
4,Critical Pedagogy review,"I have had the honor as Dr. Wink being my instructor. This is the first time I've actually read an instructors piece of work, and I have to say I am impressed. Everytime one watches movies about universities it's mentioned how their professor wrote their book; however, I have not had that luxory until now. Dr. Wink's Critical Pedagogy is a wonderful read for anyone. I loved that the book was full of examples from her own life. I could imagine myself in her shoes, and that's what I felt I needed. Knowing what Dr. Wink expierenced as a teacher, will help any future teacher in the future. This book was very insightful and I reccommend it for any future or possible teacher! I will definately keep this one on the bookshelf."
5,A must have book for anyone in education!,"Critical Pedagogy: Noted from the Real World by Joan Wink is a must have for anyone who is interested in education. Reading this book has helped me to reflect on my future goals as an educator. This book gives great ideas on how to become an effective teacher by using critical pedagogy. One of my favorite elements in the book was the Three Perspectives on Pedagogy: Transformative, Generative, and Transmission. In addition, Joan Wink also points out the importance of literacy. It is very vital that every child is accessible to books in his or her public library and school. I have has the pleasure of meeting Dr. Joan Wink this semester and I have realized how passionate she is as a professor; you will feel the same when you begin to read Critical Pedagogy: Notes from the Real World."
4,A great read for all teachers and future teachers,"Joan Wink wrote a book that is an interesting read that may change your view of the educational system and the students you teach. The book is an easy read because it is interesting and is full of personal experiences that help support what she discusses within the book. This book truly is about teaching all students and caring about each student as an individual. Wink doesn't force one perspective (her perspective) on the reader. Different philosophies are discussed and the reader can contemplate the information and learn based on the ""Joan's real world experiences"" as well as their own. This book is worth taking time to read and may change your view on education."
4,Critical Pedagogy,"Critical Pedagogy contains wonderful stories that give you a glimpse into the world of teaching. Wink offers definitions of Critical Pedagogy through experiences, of her own and of others, as well as through discussion of different ideas one could use in the classroom. The stories are touching and provide examples of Critical Pedagogy in action. I found the book to be a pleasant read because it was personal and contained useful information.There is a line on page 70 that says, ""I knew that I was learning by teaching, and we knew that the students were teaching by learning."" I think this is what the book is really about. I highly recommend this book to people who are interested in teaching because it makes you think about using different techniques, strategies, and ideas in the classroom and to discover what Critical Pedagogy means to you."
4,Beyond the Classroom,This thought provoking examination of the subject of critical pedagogy encourages us to continuously assess our teachings and learnings in and beyond the classroom and take action to improve our schools and the communities in which they exist. Joan's vivid examples from her years of teaching demonstrate her own evolution in thinking and help to reinforce the concepts of critical pedagogy.Critical pedagogy is much more than a teaching philosophy; it is a way of life. Our daily lives are full of demands and the pace of change continues to rapidly increase. To often we trudge along in life with our heads down focused on the trivial and ignore the important things. Joan's book hits you between the eyes like a two by four as she shares her own life/teaching experiences. Thanks Joan.
5,"Critical Pedagogy; Learn, Relearn, Unlearn","This book is written for the up-and-coming teacher. Dr. Wink's stories and life experiences not only educate us on pedagogy but entertain us as well. Her writing style is relaxed yet informative at the same time. This is not your everyday textbook. Her experiences cover different methods of thinking and teaching. Dr. Wink covers bilingual education and how the family unit and community can help a student become successful in learning a new language. Because the author puts her own experiences, which include failures and successes, in the text it becomes relatable to aspiring educators."
1,The Sky Is Falling,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read all of Sidney's books. I agree the main character was missing something. That is guts! Sidney's women characters are more empowered and not whimpy! From the start she was stupid and she did not catch on to any of the clues that was right in front of her. She did not get revenge which is not like Sidney characters. I felt like I had read this book before, it was very predictable. I hope Sidney's not loosing his touch. How many women do you think is going to let their boyfriend spend extensive time with their ex?"
4,Simply amazing,"I think this is one book you can't easily put it down (I didn't sleep till I finished it ) , the plot is tangled in a way you can never figure out the ending, which comes out beautifully and surprisingly, the settings are varied and exciting which adds more suspense and beauty to the events... the main character Dana has such a sensitive, curious, courageous spirit, personally I was touched with what she was doing to Kemal and her affection towards him ( maybe we could learn something or two from her 'human' feelings)..eventhough she easily trusted the new nanny and left her son for long periods of time.But I highly recommend it to everyone I know... you'll really have this feeling that the sky IS falling down..."
1,Sidney Seldom writes good books anymore,"To the people who gave this book one star, you were overly generous. I've always been intrigued by Sheldon's books but this one was obviously written by an impostor.The dialog was trite and ridiculous. We have a supposedly great anchorwoman who is known for her reporting skills flying all over the globe to share about 2 lines of conversation before going to the next city. She has no idea what she's looking for, does no investigative reporting and shows surprising naivete for someone so worldly. I found the whole book to be a big disappointment. Sorry Sid, your cookie cutter approach ain't cuttin' it no more."
2,Keep looking,"This is a good book for sitting on the beach, a weekend alone, or any time you don't want to use any brain power......what so ever......yea....a good book for the brain dead. This little paperback uses such cheesy devices I think it might have been Sidney's first book, shockingly it isn't. Sidney Sheldon is a good writer, and I have nothing against mass production, BUT WHAT HAPPENED MAN!"
4,Page Turner,"I just needed to give this book the 4 **** it's deserves. It was a complete page turner, I love how Sidney writes, he keeps the story moving along and the ending wowed me. So what if both characters were ruthless, it still was an amazing read."
1,The author could not be Sidney Sheldon,"It is hard to believe that the author of the relentlessly suspenseful Rage of Angels and Bloodline could have written this book. I would not have finished it if I had not thought that it would get better. It didn't. The characters are poorly developed and unrealistic. The dialogue between the characters is sparse, trivial, and disjointed. It is as if the author used his cut and paste option on his word processor to put the dialogue together. There are several problems that make this book rate a one star. Die hard Sheldon fans that must read this book should borrow it from their public library or wait until the paperback comes out. Do not waste your money on the hardback."
2,Not his best,Although this book has a somewhat interesting plot I feel the side stories weren't completely thought out. Mr. Sheldon could have made this a more interesting story than he did. Pick up one of his earlier works before this one.
2,Too Predictable,"Sidney Sheldon used to write good books. This one was too predictable and the smart TV newslady was in fact not. And I agree with one of the other reveiwers, people do not call everyone darling! If you want to read it, borrow it from a friend or the library."
1,See Dick Throw the Ball to Spot,The Dick & Jane books I first read in kindergarten were better written than this book. The dialog was exceedingly repetitious & unimaginative. The characters weren't developed. The book was a bore! Readers deserve the courtesy of an author putting forth some effort when writing. I definitely don't recommend wasting valuable time or money on this book!
1,"Boring, waste of time.","I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It was very unbelieveable. What, a news reporter playing detective, getting away from work, traveling all over the world, getting in to see high profile individuals and having them interested in her questions enough to take the time to talk with her about it. I don't think so. Written on a third grade reading level."
2,BORING!,What a disappointment from Sheldon. The children's story of Henny Penny is much more interesting and better written than this Sheldon novel. Boring! Could barely finish it!
2,Least interesting Sheldon book I'd read so far,"I'd read about 7 of his works - Tell Me Your Dreams, Doomsday Conspiracy, Best Laid Plans, Master of the Game etc. - and this is without doubt, the least interesting among them all. A plain vanilla with a straightforward plot. What happened to the uniqueness? The story seemed so surreal and it just didn't 'connect' with me. Also, the twists and turns were lacking, and so is the storyline. The captivation I'd so anticipated just did not appear. Perhaps there had been too much hype built into this latest work. Would advice an avoid on this one. The word disappointing would sum my comments.But if you are a new reader, do listen to what some others had said and check out the older books - they truly are fascinating works. Sidney Sheldon is a great writer overall despite this not-up-to-the mark book. He's in his eighties now and that alone deserves much respect. I would say he's one of the best writers that'd lived the 20th century (and most of it too!)."
2,Read the next one,"This book has too many twists and turns. The book goes on and on, from country to country. Dana travels throughout the world, but the book never tells how she paid for it. Leaves her son and fiance to run after a killer that had absolutely nothing to do with her. I'm glad it's over!!"
5,Fast & Flashy,"A friend of mine told me to read it. I did, only took five days to finish it. One of the best mind spinning suspense I've read in a long time. The ending leaves you smiling. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a fast book."
3,Not One of Sheldon's Better Books,"I just finished reading The Sky is Falling by one of my fav authors and I must say that I was disappointed. This book was good, but it was not one of Sheldon's better novels. The heroine's actions were predictable and the character development lacked Sheldon's usual depth. I have read every book that Sheldon wrote and really expected another suspense thriller from this master storyteller. But alas, it was not. Everything about this story line was predictable and the reader was just not held in suspense as they usually when caught up in one of Sheldon's novels.Not one of Sheldon's better books, but I still look forward to his next book!"
3,"Not the best, but not the worst....","Any Sidney Sheldon will keep me interested, although his last few novels are far from the ""Master of the Game"" glory days. Worth reading, but not at full price. Wait for the paperback version."
1,I beg to differ . . .,"I beg to differ with the reviewer that described this work of fiction as being written on a third grade level - that is just plain mean-spirited. It was actually written on a fifth-grade level! I actually laughed aloud at the implausiblity of some of the situations - the one-dimensional characters, the coincidences and the fact that none of the other law enforcement agencies investigated any of the ""accidents"" incurred by the Winthrops is just ludicrous! And Dana's globetrotting at what must have been enormous expense when most of the questions could have been answered through a phone call. Earlier Sheldon works were so entertaining - he should probably hang it up if this is all he can manage at this stage in his life."
2,The sky fell,"Generally, a Sheldon novel has a good mix of drama and suspense. In ""The Sky is Falling"", it has neither. Also lacking is any depth of characters, there are many characters we hardly get to know. Sheldon has allowed some insight to Dana by printing her thoughts, and this adds depth to her. The plot is good, and really had the potential to make a captivating read, but unfortunately it failed. I kept reading thinking there would be a great ending to make up for the rest of the book, but that too, was ho-hum. All in all, disappointing to a Sheldon fan."
1,and it fell through boredom!!,"Nothing like making money off the Sheldon name. I would have been ashamed to write this book. All those 'darlings' made you want to throw up! The plot is trite and predictable, you could punch holes in it with your fist! Terrible book."
4,A cool read,"I think this one was great, as most other Sheldon's books; one that I could not put down. As some of you may be aware, the main character, Dana Evans, has once appeared in previous Sheldon's work: The Best Laid Plans. I have to admit that this book is not my favourite from Sheldon, but you won't be disappointed."
1,anonymous in Alabama,I cannot believe Sidney Shelton wrote this book. I waited in anticipation for this book and was sorely disappointed. I think this is the worst book I have ever read by him.
2,displeasure,"This book starts off fine with setting the plot and the story into the mmod, but as the story progresses, the all too perfect character who seems to be super-human with her intelligence learns some lessons in live. Then after the climax, he makes the story short, ands silly. He could have at least introducted more characters rather than generalizing everything in a few pages.He tries to keep the mystery unfolding, and right at the end, you figure that this is not a book to be in your collection. I have read all his books, but this caught me by surprise. I would have given 5 stars to most of his books, but this. no way."
2,The Sky Has Made a Crash Landing,"Oy... what to say... this book is by far not one of Sidney Sheldon's better productions. It is lame and entirely too predictable. I had to keep checking the cover to remind myself that this was written by Sidney Sheldon and not Mary Higgens Clark. Is this the same writer that penned Bloodline, Master of the Game and Rage of Angels? Uhm... in a word; no. I've been a fan of Sidney Sheldon's for years but this book is slow, tedious and as a side note to every writer over 50, people do not refer to each other as ""darling"", much less constantly!! Anyway, if you want to enjoy Sidney Sheldon at his best read one of the 3 aforementioned books, not this pedantic novel."
1,"Oh Sidney, what have you done??","If you picked up ""The Sky is Falling"" because it was written by the famous Sidney Sheldon, you will be grossly disappointed in what you find between its covers. Like other reviews here it is: flat, tepid, and extremely predictable. It would not be so horrible if it were written by a first-time author but this is S. Sheldon, for Pete's sake, not a newcomer. The sad part about this read is that now I don't want to read another Sheldon book. I do realize that this is not fair to his ability. However, he set this piece of fluff in motion and William Morrow HarperCollins printed it. Where are the good editors when you need them? If an unknown author wrote this book, it would never have found a publisher."
1,Pass on this one,"I finished this book and pretty much immediately forgot what it was about. Carboard characters and a lack of energy make this Sheldon novel one to pass on. Usually I read Sheldon on an airplane-- guaranteed to finish it before I land. And usually his stories are fun diversions. But his latest lacks his better touches-- a fast, twisty-curvy plot."
2,The sky did fall,"I hope someone will set me straight. This is my first and may be my last sidney sheldon. I have heard many wonderful things about sheldon, but after reading ""sky is falling"" I will utter looking back. Who's who..is the downfall in this story.A paper and pen is needed to keep track of the very dull, bleed you dry characters I kept asking myself where's the glamour, where's the sex, the twists the turns?..As I reached quarter left of this book I realized I was outta luck. the story moves very fast. That Dale sure gets around!! Must be nice to have a job that lets you take that much time off!!"
1,I loved this book!,"If by ""loved"" you mean ""loathed"" and if by ""this book"" you mean ""this piece of garbage."" I would say the characterization comes off as flat, but that would be an insult to flat characterization. This book has NO characterization. None. Nada. Zilch. Zero. You don't give one rip about the characters or their lives. Ditto for the tepid plot. Ditto for the awkward, wooden dialogue. Ugh, it makes me hurt just thinking about it. I've read bad books before that nonetheless drew me in, affording the opportunity to at least suspend my disbelief even if the story still stunk in the end. The Sky Is Falling is not one of those novels. Buy this if you're a writer and need a primer on how NOT to craft your fiction. Otherwise, steer clear."
3,The sky is falling,"This book was definatly not one of Sheldon's best novels, but it deserves a 2 and a half. First of all the plot was very unsuspenseful, by the middle of the book you can basically tell whose behind the events. I did however enjoy the suprise ending which I wasen't exactly suspecting. A good plus about this book is if you are a softie and don't enjoy rape ect this is perfect it was very clean."
3,"Interesting, but not his best...","I loved Master of the Game, Memories of Midnight and the Otherside of Midnight. This book was not the same quality. Sheldon is a terrific story teller. I have not read one of his books that I did not like. I was surprised to learn the city in Russia that Sheldon refers to is actually a real city. I felt that part of the book was a little ""corny"", but apparently the city is a real place, even today."
2,We want the ORIGINAL Sidney Sheldon back!,"There is absolutely no comparison to the earlier books that Sidney has authored. 'The Sky is Falling' leaves a lot to be desired and is nothing like 'Doomsday Conspiracy', 'Windmills of the Gods',... There is no thrill or suspense - everything is so obvious. Don't waste your money. Borrow it from your local library."
4,"Entertaining, but definately not Sheldon's best","Sheldon's books always seem to be fast paced, and he doesn't disappoint in his tendency to travel the globe in his stories with this book either. But this novel seemed a little too predictable, a little too ""cut and dried"", and the characters never fully developed into what they could have and should have been. Plus there was no feeling of satisfaction at the end, no good follow ups to the leftover threads from incidents and even characters that were only partially developed in the story.However, I do love Sidney Sheldon, and all of his books do indeed offer up a quick, fast getaway that is enjoyable and easy to get into. If you are a first time Sidney Sheldon reader, I recommend some of his better books, like Master Of The Game, Bloodline, and If Tomorrow Comes."
1,Banality,I rented the CD book from the library. I do not write long reviews but instead like to point out the major flaws or good points.The storyline is OK. However the sheer banality of the diaglogue is almost staggering. The average emotional and mental IQ of the characters is extremely low. These people are not interesting!!!!!!!!
2,Not So Great :o(,"i have only read three books by him. The others were terrific, but this one was just lacking something that is crucial to make it good. It was a page turner alright, but I was ready for it to end and still had half of the book to read. It also confused me some of his usage of unfamilar terms and words. If you have never read a book by this author I would skip this one and pick another."
5,A Page-turning read,"I highly recommend this book. The story was fast-pasing, you'll never get bored!"
2,Its Just Okay.,This book is OKAY. I'm closer to 2.8 stars but not quite 3. The plot is simple and its easy to follow. It lacks the suspense of Sheldon's earlier books though. All in all its not bad if you are looking for a quick uncomplicated read.
3,I still think nothing beats ...........,"I have been a sidney sheldon fan ever since he wrote his first book.. ""the naked face"" .. and i have read every single one of his books. the sky is falling is alright.. but i still think that ""the sands of time"", ""nothing lasts forever"", ""windmills of the gods"", ""if tomorrow comes"" and the one, uhhhh, ""i forgot the title to this one, it has the story of jennifer, a lawyer who gets pregnant by a senator and has a son by him, joshua, and then messes around with michael moretti"" are the most fun ones that i read over and over. the other ones well are alright as well. the others that i have mentioned are like Gold and just over the line.. the best i have read.. and will continue to read"
2,"Jennifer , Madison, Al.","I am an avid book reader and a fan of Sidney Sheldon, but this has been the most difficult book to read. It just did not keep my interest. I must say this has been one of the least favorite of his books that I have ever read."
1,Don't Bother,"I can't believe that Sidney Sheldon wrote this novel. I have read all of his novels, and enjoyed them, but I found myself skimming this one after I was only halfway done. The dialogue between the characters was lame and unbelievable. The story was choppy and didn't flow at all. I was thankful I borrowed this book from the library!I found it very disappointing."
2,"Fun, But...",This book was a fun read. It flowed well and kept my interest. But it was entirely predictable and filled with stereotypes. The characters were thin and not built up very well.
3,Not as exciting as some of his other books...,"I really like Sidney Sheldon's books. They make you turn the pages like there's no tomorrow. You can't put them down! However, this book wasn't as exciting for me. In fact I found myself getting very irritated while reading it because it seemed redundant. Instead of reading this book, I'd highly recommend any of these: Rage of Angels, The Other Side of Midnight, Memories of Midnight, or my favorite, Master of the Game. Sidney is wonderful but The Sky is Falling is not one of his best."
2,Disappointing,"I have read all of Sheldon's novels and this is like no other. It was too predictable and the story line flat. Usually he introduces and elaborates on more characters, whereas this book focuses on one main character who has a boyfriend with whom she communicates mainly via phone. (Why did she have that boyfriend anyway .. it was an unnecessary distraction in the book.)"
1,The Sky Is Falling,"This is unlike Sidney Sheldon's other novels. I found this flat and very predictable. A quick reading book, it left me with the feeling ""is that all there is to it"". I'm certainly glad this isn't the first Sidney Sheldon novel I've ever read or I may not have picked up any of his earlier novels."
1,Total disappointment,"I used to be his fan, but this book really disappoints me. The plot has obvious holes and the only explanation I can find is that the author just wrote it, didn't bother to read it twice and published it. To give you an example in the book, the russia spy risked his life to show the American journalist the neclear secret and begged her to smugged him abroad. He was killed. But days later, his brother miraclously went to US and even bombed the bad guys out of the sky for revenge. Gee, why not asking his brother for help in the first place?Sheldon has other good books. Don't waste your money and time on this one!"
3,Not up to par,"This was definitely not up to Sheldon's usual standards. The book had too many coincidences (like how Dana kept getting interviews with all the people she needed at just the right time and how she spent zero time in the office and all her time out chasing down a theory on company time and expense). Characters were introduced, described and then never seen nor heard from again. And the intensity of this book just never reached a point where I felt really interested in what was going to happen in the end. I didn't become attached to the characters and didn't feel like I knew enough about them to care. An easy read, but not one that kept me up all night."
2,Disappointing!,"I was thoroughly disappointed with the pace of the book until it got about halfway through. What bothered me even more, as a tv journalist was the way Dana's bosses gave her carte blanche to go flitting around the world on the thin leads she had...and her half of a record-setting ratings newsteam! The other thing that bothered me was how she brought Kemal to the US from Sarajevo and seemed to ignore him until too late. I would think her ""investigative skills"" would've made her question why a usually hyperactive adolescent all of a sudden took afternoon naps! If Sidney thinks the reading public is this naive, maybe he should hang up his keyboard."
1,No longer Master of the Game,"As Master of the Game, Sidney Sheldon was unsurpassed as a fiction author - until now. This book was the biggest disappointment. The characters are shallow, the plot flat, and as for the proverbial 'couldn't put it down', well, I could."
3,Did Not Put Much Effort Into This One,"THE SKY IS FALLING BY Sidney SheldonHis standard book with a main character a female, this time a TV journalist who adopted a 12-year boy with one arm while in Sarajevo? She spent the book unraveling a family murder mystery of a US family that took her from Germany, through France to Russia. Of course, she became the hunted one during the adventures. Another female with cancer gave a good support role in the book. I like to read Sidney books, because you know what you will get and they don't stretch the mind-just good entertainment."
4,SAVE THE WORLD,"I HAVE BEEN A READER OF SIDNEY SHELDON SINCE THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT AND HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF THE PLOTS.DANA WAS A BIT NAIVE TO TRUST THE HUDSONS SO READILY.I ALSO QUESTIONED THE CONVIENCE OF GETTING A SITTER SO QUICKLY SO SHE COULD GO RUNNING ALL OVER THE GLOBE TRYING TO SOLVE THE MURDERS.USUALLY, I DON'T PICK ""WHO DUN IT"" BUT IN THIS NOVEL I WAS CORRECT, I STILL LIKED THE BOOK AND FINISHED IT DURING THE COURSE OF 1 DAY."
4,not his best but a good read nonetheless,"It's definitely a Sheldon-- I couldn't put the book down and finished it in one sitting! It's not as good as Master of the Game and Rage of Angels, but the same fast-paced, easy to follow and page-turning plot is there. Worth every penny. Mr. Sheldon remains to be my favorite author!"
2,Didn't I see this on 60 Minutes?,"First of all, I like Sidney Sheldon books. I have read all of them. But the basis for the plot of this book was a segment I saw on 60 minutes over a year ago. Sidney, Sidney, Sidney -- we need some originality here... call me sometime and I know I can help you out with it.This book was fast-paced and fun... but there was no new ground explored here.I would recommend ""Master of the Game and If Tomorrow Comes"" as his best books.Perhaps I will re-read these, as they were original :)Ciao for now, Stetson"
4,Par,"See storyline above.As far as the story goes, it is a real page turner. I must admit this is my first Sheldon novel. I'm a little disappointed in the brevity of his writing style. It reads somewhat like cliff notes. It is, no doubt, fast paced, but written in the summary style that it is, it would be hard to be slow paced. If you just want a fun read, and really quick, this is the book for you.Recommended...For younger readers and older readers who like thrills."
1,Sheldon is falling!,"When we read the first work of an author and it is bad, we might throw away the book and simply forget about it. But when we read a bad book by an author whose work used to be good, we feel deeply offended and even angry. That is how I felt after I finished reading The Sky is falling. Does Mr. Sheldon think his readers are stupid? Superficiality is the bottom line of this book. Card board characters, banal events, a stupid heroin, catastrophic dialogues are a few of many negative points of this book. I read it to the end to see how worse it can get and in this one aspect, the book was a winner! It started bad, got worse and ended up to be the worst book I had ever read.Dear Mr. Sheldon, it is not the sky that is falling, it is YOU!"
4,"A good, basic piece of equipment...","A simple straightforward piece of equipment. Does all the basic functions well. Easy to install, It fit my large-frame Trek bike with no problems. I would have liked another 12"" of cable to wrap the line a bit more, but it was adequate. Both the sensor and readout mount solidly with supplied cable ties. They provided enough cable ties, though I used a few extra I had laying around the house. Easy to read... even with my aging eyes. I'm a regular rider and can't imagine why most riders would need to spend more for a higher-end model. Delivery was suprisingly fast via USPS... about 4 days as I recall to Maryland."
4,Nice little device,"I intended to purchase a wireless model, but mistakenly bought this wired version. The wiring was really easy, and really doesn't interfere.Nice little device. Easy to operate."
4,A basic bike computer.,"I am an older casual bike rider and ride only on bicycle trails in my local area. The Velo 5 was easy to install and seems to work well. The print on the instructions is small for someone with old eyes, but that is not their fault. This is a good basic computer for an ocassional bicyclist."
2,Do-wop stuff,"If you're a free jazz-fan, please don't buy this record. If you do like do-wop stuff and catchy poptunes, this will be your piece of cake!"
2,start somewhere else,"As much as I hate to give Sun Ra a bad review, I felt kind of ripped off after I got this. The first CD is all doo wop stuff that really didn't do it for me. Two songs were really awesome: ""Blues on Planet Mars,"" and ""Mayan Temples;"" about 4 others on the second disk were ok if you used your powers of imagination to get past the bad sound quality. I would save this one for only the most devoted, bed sheet wearing Ra freaks out there."
1,Never Receive the Equipment,"I was looking forward to using this machine. Placed an order on August 2, 2006 for next day delivery. It never arrived. Called Amazon on August 3, 2006 and was promised for delivery on the next day. It never arrived. Called DHL on August 4th and was told by them that Amazon never sent the package out. Called Amazon and was told that it was sent out and to expect the package the latest on Monday, August 7th. Was told if it wasn't there on Monday to call back and they would re-ship. Package never came on Monday. Called back Tuesday, August 8th and cancelled the order. The only good point about this is that the customer service people were friendly although not helpful since i never got my order. Will try to place the order with another company.The 1 star is for Amazon Service. I cannot rate teh machine."
1,No stars for this product,"I was excited when I ordered this product. I got super savings shipping and it arrived quickly. However, when I unpacked the product, it was missing pieces and missing most of the hardware, so I could not even begin to put it together. I promptly packed it up and sent it back. Thank you very much!"
2,a disappointing product,"I bought this laptop on Christmas and it turned out to be an unpleasant Christmas gift for myself. The hard drive died all of a sudden after two months. Although Compaq replaced the hard drive for me eventually, I had to pay myself for rescuing my two weeks' work. The repaired laptop I got back from Compaq works poorly and I have encountered a lot of unexpected problems when running programs. In addition, the keyboard of the laptop is not reacing very well and the noise of the laptop is tremedous. These were problems even before the original hard drive died."
2,"repetitious, illogical, ambiguous and silly","Read N.T. Writght, John Meier, E.P, Sanders, James Charlesworth and Alan Watts. Borg states he hasn't experienced death so cannot say whether there is an afterlife or not and yet apparently he has experienced God with a political/socio-economic agenda for a possible finite world. A waste of time."
1,Yet another book by Borg purchased for school,"I must say that the reason I chose Borg for my study was that the Borg in Star Trek is interesting to me. I discovered that Borg and the Borg both want to asimilate you into their way of life. While ""the Borg"" is make believe, Borg lives in the real world and his beliefs should be in the Star Trek universe. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Yet another attempt to bring Jesus down to the level of other spiritual people. I guess if you don't like being held accountable for what you do then Borg's philosophy would be for you."
1,Losing My Religion,"Simply stating: Any book written by Marcus Borg is worthy of nothing more than the heretical bonfire that should be started in the critical time of Christianity in the world.If you would like to lose your faith, then please read this book."
5,Very thought provoking,"This book makes a lot of good points about the negative affects of the way that many people practice Christianity. He gives examples from both the Bible and other published work, both modern and ancient. The tone of the book is very similar to ""Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time."""
2,"Identifies problems in Christianity, yet fail in resolution","Borg struggles with the form of Christianity that overshadows the Spirit of God. He expresses valid concerns and many relate to his deeply personal struggle, yet utlimately Borg's solution falls short of embracing the paradox of faith. He opts to zap the divinity of Christ by overly identifying with the humanity. His ideas may seem fresh and orginal, but in reality they are really old heresies warmed over."
3,The God We Already Knew,"I have heard Marcus Borg speak a number of times. I have always come away from his presentations feeling like I was being challenged to believe what I already believe. It feels like he is trying to stir controversy where there is none. I felt much the same through much of my reading of The God We Never Knew. Maybe his arguments may persuade some readers of the immanence of God and God's power to transform our lives in the day to day business of living. If it does, then his mission is accomplished. But I have already felt this and am well aware of it. The most interesting part of The God We Never Knew is the discussion of how the domination system influenced and influences the understanding of God's Kingdom. This discussion did open my eyes to a new understanding of the interface of politics and religion. But there was not much else new in this book."
3,Computer Architecture,I used this book as an undergraduate in college. It was used as an introduction to students who were pursuing a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computers. Unless you intend to use this book as a reference I would not recommend it to anyone without an adequate background in algebra or trigonometry. This book is for the technical individual with the math background necessary for understanding the concepts illustrated in the book.
2,Is this made in china?,amazon - please identify country or countries of origin of ALL items.This would make it easier for Americans to shop wisely for themselves and their families and children
5,Thomas spoon and fork are a big hit with grandson!,This silverware set was a big hit with my19 month old grandson. He is just getting into Thomas gear and loves using his special fork and spoon.
4,Thomas lovers will love,"These are adorable. We bought them to complete the ""set"" (plate, bowl, cup). Seem sturdy and have held up in the dishwasher so far."
5,pecoware/Thomas the Tank Engine Spoon and Fork Set,Like it very much. Easy for a two year old to hold and jabs into his food easily. He loves Thomas so was a great gift for him for Christmas
3,good but small,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son and he loved it but it was too small for him...it was slightly bigger than the spoon I used when I was spoon-feeding him. He got frustrated when using the set because not enough food was going into his mouth so he just ended up using his hands. Granted, he does love to eat and loves shoving food into his mouth so if you have a toddler that doesn't mind little portions of food at a time then this is perfect for you!"
5,Great set,Bought this set for my Grandson. Great set for little hands. Has held up well to daily usage. Worth the price.
5,review,Great my nephew loved it he has decided to save it for the future and for his children when he becomes an adult
3,Thomas the Train Silverware,"My son loves Thomas so we bought him this silverware set. They are kind of cheap but ok. Not the higher quality that you are used to with Zak Design. They are ok, not that great!"
5,fFork and spoon,Perfect for toddlers little hands. My granddaughter loves using them. Thomas is a big hit at our home!! Highly recommended
4,good quality,"glad i ordered these, they have gone in the dishwasher every day for a month now, and look brand new."
1,"Poor Written Instructions, Poorly Engineered Product","After reading the first two reviews, I plunged ahead with this purchase wondering ""How hard can it be to install a retractable screen door?"" Well, pretty much impossible with instructions written and illustrated by someone had apparently not tried to install the product themselves and definitely impossible with a heavy, clunky, ineffectively designed product. You can get it cheaper at Home Depot ($129.99) but, honestly, $1.29 is still too much to spend on this futile exercise. Save yourself the time and find another solution."
2,Less than impressed...,"Like everybody else, I bought this not because I wanted it, but because it was the class text and thus, required. In that sense, it did its job (and the instructor's) in that it conveyed the information needed to pass the exams.The downside:--Numerous typo's, especially in the practice problems, leaving you to wonder why your answer doesn't jibe with the book's. Frustrating.--SEVERAL leaps in logic: The book will (loosely) explain a concept. Then it will give an equation with no explanation as to how it was derived from the original concept. Sure, you can just memorize the equation, but without understanding WHY it works, it's awful hard to apply it to the real world. VERY frustrating.--Many concepts are glossed over. Not too useful to those making a career of this.I suppose this book is somewhat useful for a refresher course in geometry and basic surveying math, but it's no value.Get it only if you have to. And get it used."
4,Good study material,"I purchased this book to use to study for my Fundementals of Surveying exam. This book covers most topics needed for the exam. I studied it along with the Sample Exam, and passed my test. It falls short on information about GIS. It would be helpful to use this book in conjunction with another study aid. It doesn't go into great detail on any topic but its a excellant overveiw. A basic idea on what your studying would be helpful because this book it not the best at teaching you something your not familar with.I gave it four stars because I passed, and this was my main study guide. However I highly recommend additional study material."
4,Good reference for non-surveyors,"I bought this book to use as a reference for the surveying portion of the civil PE exam that California requires. I thought it was very well organized and contained all the information that I needed for our test. I also used some of the practice problems in the back of each chapter to help refresh my memory and prepare for the exam. I know that it is not comprehensive for people taking the LS or LSIT, but it is better than the surveying textbook I was required to purchase when I was in college."
3,Nice Background Book,"This book is resonably well written and is aligned with the NCEES models for Fundamentals of Surveying (FS) and Principles of Surveying (PS) exams. About 60% of book is math related starting with fractional multiplication and proceeding through state plane to Lat/Lon conversions. Other areas include limited introductions to Boundary Law and Business Practices. Outside of the math, I would not depend too heavily on this book for answers."
2,Same old stuff,"The first several ""Callahan's"" books were great. The last several have had no new ideas and a lot of reuse of the same old stuff. You can look at this book and read entire paragraphs that have been lifted out of the previous books."
2,Not Spider's best effort,Frankly I was bored. Perhaps having read all the Callahan books has left me expecting a better effort. The inspired creativity present in earlier works has disappeared in this and certainly Callahan's Key.
2,Spider has done better in the past,"I have loved all of Spider Robinson's books about the Callahan bunch! However, this book just didn't meet the standard of his other works.."
5,This Book Makes You Laugh Out Loud,I have read several of Bennett's books & this is the most fun yet. I keep reading his books hoping to capture the pure joy of this one. It really is excellent.
4,Great,"These are great, very comfortable. I would not say they are military specs, but great shorts none the less."
4,africa's greatest hunter,"This is a superb book for anyone who has ever wanted to feel like they were a part of a safari without actually being there.Selous was one of the best white hunters to step foot on the continent,so this book is worth looking into."
3,good writing but the heroine:(.....,"The premise, a female archelogist, great, right? The story started well, but after a series of stupid, naive and annoying events by the heroine (including shooting at the hero,to ""scare him away"" while he's on horseback in a chasm!?!) I gave up.I will probably try this writer again, as she seems competent, but I cannot stand ""too stupid to live"" heroines. Authors please take note-don't have your heroine do things in your book that you would consider reckless or stupid in real life.The hero is fabulous so you may want to try this book.3 stars for a good premise and a good try."
4,What a great story,"I will read almost anything that includes a reference to archaeology. They occasionally disapoint, but this one certainly didn't. The characters are well drawn and sympathetic, the situations are absorbing. I was sorry for this story to end. Thank you Kristen. Please keep 'em coming."
4,"Excellent, but gets used up quickly","The package was smaller than I expected and was gone after 3-5 packages (depending on how fragile the items are and how much you need.) Walmart sells a larger cushion wrap for about $16 to 17 dollars. I haven't compared footage, but I think the Walmart one would be more economical in the long run if you have to mail a lot of packages."
5,"Easy to read and understand, two thumbs up!",KISS - Keep it simple and stupid. This is one of the best personal finance books that I've ever read. I managed to finish it over the last weekend. Excellent for beginners like me!
5,Perhaps not the only but certainly the first,Perhaps not the only but certainly the first investment guide. It focuses on basics and provides sound information. I routinely give this book as a gift typical as a Graduation Gift. It dispels many of the myths that investing is too complicated and that we should blindly hand our money to brokers. Anyone testing the waters of investing past passbook savings account should read this book first.
2,Watch out for Politics,"There are some solid concepts presented in this text. Tobias chooses to assume a place on a soap box and preach politics to the point of being nauseating. Ifyou prefer your personal finance to be separate from politics, avoid this book."
5,Good updates,We were very pleased with the updates Mr. Tobias has made to his book. It lives up to its title. Well worth the price.
3,Avoiding losing is not winning,"Andrew Tobias provides an excellent guide on how to avoid losing. Unfortunately, that does not necessarily amount to winning. While this common-sense book is extremely logicical on the surface I have yet to meet or hear of the first person who acheived financial independence by following its recommendations even though it has been in print for decades. Sadly, the title is incorrect. While this is a good book on saving and cutting one's cost of living, it is not the only investment guide you will ever need."
2,Not quite informative,"I'm very fond of reading and repetition, so even if i know something already I don't have a problem reading it again in a different book, but this book was just one of the worst investment books i have ever read! He mostly talks about how to limit your budget (which, i do have to agree, is important) and what NOT to invest in. It should be called ""The only SAVINGS book you'll ever need"". And I'm not trying to put down Andrew, I actually know a friend of his and was told great things about him (Thats what got me to buy the book), but he tried to do something that didn't work, he tried to cram EVERYTHING about investing into one book, and he ended up saying nothing because he had to limit every subject.now the reason I did give it 2 stars (and not one) is because I hold very strongly of the principle ""There's no book that you cant learn anything from"". So no, I do not REGRET buying the book but I would not recommend it."
2,Title of Book is a Misnomer,"The book, ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" is a gross misnomer. At best, the book should be entitled ""A Good Personal Finance Guide"". If a person bought the book, as I did, for expert stock market investment guidance, he/she may likely be highly disappointed. The book contains very good personal finance guidance, that's all. Way overstated with the title!!"
2,Eh kinda sucks now,This book was the first finance book I ever read back in the 90s now. I loved it at the time. I recently boaugh a copy and it just does not grab me. I would suggest something by Swedroe or Bogle.
3,Trite,"Not an interesting read. Reads like an encyclopedia. Everything is there. A reference, not a strait through read!"
1,WORST BOOK EVER,"This book was terrible. PLEASE do not waste your money on it. Anything of value in this book, you probably know already. PLEASE, in these tough economic times, find a better book to spend your money on."
3,Not very practical! OUT OF DATED! Just OK!,"It is a OK book if you buy it cheap ( < $2 ). It is really outdated. Lots of suggestions are too extreme. For example, trim your own hair and do your own tax. C'mon! There are some helpful suggestions. You just need to decide based on your own situation. The author did great job to make concepts easy to understand. Thus, I give 3 stars out of 5."
4,True to its title,"I found this book very readable and full of excellent information. Although not all the latest vehicles are included, the information is useful for the typical investor. It is easy to read and understand by the beginning investor."
4,VERY PRACTICAL--FUN TO READ,"I read this book on a recent plane trip from Orlando. Very practical & informative. Sorta of like ""A Random Walk Down Wallstreet"" only for per- sonal finance. The only downside is that it leaves the reader wondering; ""now what am I supposed to do"" As a followup to this excellent work by Tobias, Ihighly recommend ""Wealth Without Risk"" and ""Financial Self Defense"" by Charles J. Givens. The later two mentioned books will provide any serious reader with the ""how"" and are also very easy to read."
5,Thoughtful Advice for Love,"I am very grateful for the guidance Ms. Pina provides in this book. I could definitely see myself in some of the numerous examples she provides the reader regarding past relationship experiences. It's so easy to feel alone when love isn't working out the way one plans, so I found it very reassuring that others face similar challenges. I really appreciate all the exercises as well as her advice on how to break old patterns that did not lead to love. I am very hopeful now and even find myself relating better to others not only in romance, but in all close relationships. Ms. Pina's book has been a huge blessing in my life!"
2,Little help,"There are a lot of stories used as examples, however the action items were only a couple of chapters. It is based on religion with quotes from the Bible through out. It did, however, point out that it was ourselves that we must look at and change and not others.All in all, although some of the stories were interesting, it offered few suggestions that could be taken away and acted upon"
2,This book is poorly organized and not very useful,"Delphi Programming Explorer is one of the few books on Delphi that I found almost useless. It is poorly organized, and does not show the simplicity and ease of use of Delphi. It is not a book for the beginner or expert programmer."
4,Great price Different class,"Great price, but a little different Robin Hood. This is a different class of this version. Even good very little kids to watch."
4,Very good educational toy,"This product is very good for helping children to develop their mind capabilities. Is very important to do that from an early age. And this is a good product for accomplishing this goal. I remember having one of these when I was a child.The only problem (with this toy specifically) is that if your child loose one piece, the toy becomes almost useless. So you need to take care that the child do not loose any piece."
5,Tangoes Jr is fun!,"My four-year old son likes this toy! It makes a great toy for in the car or waiting at a doctor's office, etc. The shapes have a storage drawer just for them and the in-lay pictures have a durable coating & have their own drawer. He can pick out a picture by himself, put it in, and figure out the shapes to make it. The shapes are magnetic so they don't slip off or fall on the floor until he's done. There are two levels of difficulty to the pictures. The first level has the outline of the shapes needed and on the back side of each picture is the advanced level where the child has to figure out the parts needed without the outlines. If your child loves it and wants more, there are additional sets of in-lay pictures you can purchase. So I would recommend this toy to other parents!"
5,Educational toy my 3 yo enjoys and her friends' Mommies want,"My daugther really enjoys this toy and at 3 yo the Level 1 she can do on her own, as well as work on some of the Level 2 cards (which are simply a harder version--without outlines--of the same shapes as on Level 1) with a little help.The toy is easy to carry with the little grey handle at the top, the cards store inside the hard case, and is great for taking to restaurants, grandma's, friends' homes, car play, etc. My little one was also very excited to show it off to her grandparents the other day. The hardest things about this toy is keeping the big people's hands off it so she can ""do it herself""!Highly recommend!"
5,VERY good game...,This game I would suggest to parents! It keeps my 4 yr old very interested and he has gotten very good at this game! It is putting pieces of shapes together to form a puzzle figure. There are many to chooose from and it is both sided. The other side is kinda hard for kids to do because it does not tell you what shapes go where but it is a GREAT game overall!
4,Great educational toy for long trips,"This toy keeps my daughter entertained for an hour at a time which is great on the road. There are several websites you can print additional free puzzles from. The only drawback is there are more environmentally friendly ways to make your own tangrams, through paper, cloth, digital app, etc. Minus one star for unsustainablility."
3,okay but doesn't pack well,"This set is okay if space and weight are not a concern. You can also buy these pieces separately at a camping store and some sporting goods stores. I recommend this because then you can select the pieces yourselves, and the quality is better this way. I find that these sets have lower quality."
1,This is lie,"This watch is a lie!!! There is no steel watch from Timex Data link. I'm buyng this watch not first time and I know. In fact I called Timex and confirmed there is no model that has steel, except steel that is on band. So do your self a favor don't buy this watch from Watchesnthings. Buy real stuff http://www.amazon.com/Timex-Mens-Ironman-Watch-T5C291/dp/B000B545B4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=watches&qid;=1237479469&sr;=8-1Yes, it is acrilic, but it is real and true, not lie!!!"
4,book review,"Overall, the book is delightful and a great source for primary readers (grade 2+). The biography is thorough and the language is written in the way that's easy for kids to understand. I also like the fact that the prints are big enough so that the reading doesn't appear too overwhelming despite it being 80pgs. The only thing that I wish it had would be better illustrations. The pictures are a bit sketchy and should be more colorful."
3,Sub-Title is Misleading,"This book is more along the lines of an ""apologia"" for Reincarnation. It seems to be written for Christians (Catholics in particular) in an attempt to try to ""prove"" the existence of reincarnation. I was actually attracted to this book because of the subtitle ""Transcending your Past, Transforming your Future."" I did not need to be ""convinced,"" so most of the book was wasted on me. There is actually very little on transcending your past or transforming your future. Had I known this, I would have looked elsewhere. However if you need a good book to give to your Catholic mother-in-law who has a closed-minded aversion to the idea of Karma and reincarnation, this would be a good book to introduce her to the subject."
3,Feeding the Berliners,"Having travelled to Berlin three times, it was interesting to see this documentary, so I could try to understand what Berlin and Germany was like in 1948. It must have been strange for the Americans, British etc for the Germans to change so quickly from an enemy to an ally of sorts that had to be fed and protected. I read a book about the Battle of Berlin in 1945 and even before the war had finished, the German's started seeing the Americans, British etc as protectors and allies. There were a couple of things missing from this documentary, such as the wide spread prostitution of German Women, the marriage's of Soldiers and Airmen in the Occupation Forces to German Women and if there was any interference with the Berlin Airlift by the Russians?? There was an interesting movie made about the Berlin Airlift in 1949 called the ""The Big Lift"" which I think Amazon has for sale."
4,Good stuff,"Really liked the jacket ! It fits very well, great inseam, quite warm, looks great and is as good as it gets. it was much better than what i saw on the website. so probably it calls for the photographs of the jacket to be updated on the website.the delivery took time though i think it was because i chose ground shipping ."
2,skip this one,"First of all, i am a huge Otis Rush fan. The man knew how to get great sound from his guitar and was right up there with Clapton and Buddy Guy and Stevie. And his vocals were almost always filled with so much soul and feeling.The trouble with this album for me is consistency. Otis' guitar work is not up to his usual standard on this and his vocals are just ok, with some excessive screaming on ""Every Day I Have the Blues"" and ""You're Gonna Need Me."" This was recorded live in the studio, and these all sound like 1st takes. Part of the problem is that the rhythm section and the keyboards are too loud. What ultimately does this in for me is poor production, lack of consistency on any one song, and certainly poor sound mixing and editing throughout.For better Rush albums, check out Right Place, Wrong Time, Ain't Enough Comin' In or his Cobra recordings."
3,Otis and the Blues,"When Otis Rush recorded this he was not feeling well and had had a drink too much. In fact he left the european tour he was on right after recording this and went back to the States. So is this a bad album? Should it not have been released? I say no to both of these questions. First, Rush is backed by a top-notch Chicago band with a mean Jimmy Dawkins on second guitar, and secondly, Otis seems at times possessed. He wails and screams and improvises, turning standard songs to a journey into his soul. Does this sound pathetic? Well, maybe so, but listen to Everyday I have the blues where Otis' anguished screams sends down cold chills along your spine. Or listen to the lyrics on A beautiful memory where Otis recalls how his parents listened to nice music but he only hears blues. This is not a nice blues album, it's not an album you play to feel good, but when you need some blues bordering to hell, you won't be disappointed. If you liked Cold day in hell, you should like this one too."
1,This record should never have been released,"I agree totally with Scott Free's review. This is just a very bad session (Otis had to cancel his European tour imideately after) that should have remained in the can forever. Otis has done a lot of very good works over the years, beginning with his early master pieces on Cobra and Chess, two outstanding records in the seventies Right Place Wrong Time and So Many Roads Live In Japan, and returning to the studios in the nineties with two great albums Ain't Enough Coming In from 1994 and Any Place I'm Going from 1998."
1,Don't bother,"I love Otis Rush but this CD sounds as if he was really drunk when he recorded it. I believe his voice and guitar playing are flawless perfection when he plays now but this recording from the early seventies is terrible.Please go with one of his more recent albums like ""Not enough coming in""."
1,don't waste your money,"Otis Rush is either right on or he's off. On this album he's largely off. There are some great moments, but on the whole, the bad moments ruin the performance. There are several times when Otis (or his back-up band) are so hopelessly off-key that you wonder how this ever made it to cd. For better OtisRush live, check out Tops. Or for studio albums, get Right Place Wrong Time. Otis is great live,but this album doesn't present him in a very favorable light."
5,"A wonderful gem of a book, an overlooked masterpiece.","This book will help you teach your child the importance of remembering his name and address in a non-scary way. It's a valuable book hidden in a clever fable, illustrated by my father Dik Browne (cartoonist of Hagar the Horrible). This was my fathers VERY BEST pen and ink artwork, heartwarming, funny, intricate and detailed... and it compares well to be best of Sir John Tenniel and Henrich Kley. It breaks my heart that it has not stayed in print. Hopefully it will be rediscovered. Best, Chris Browne"
5,A powerful and moving book about much more than golf.,"This is a wonderful and touching story about a father and his middle-aged son who share some two weeks of the father's last months of life on a golfing pilgrimage to Scotland. The trip is an occasion for both to reflect on what seems to have been the central relationship in their lives. Dodson's account is, by turns, funny, wistful, sad and, in all instances, warm. His father's observation that ""The game ends too soon"" is as applicable to this tale as it is to the life which is so richly celebrated here. This book deserves a wide audience of both golfers and non-golfers alike"
2,Stay away ... unless you are mad about golf!,"This is the story of a golf-crazy father and son making a long promised trip to play the courses in England, which the old-man played while posted there during the war.After all is said, this is a book about golf. And, unless you enjoy reading about golf, you should stay away."
4,final rounds...,"overall it was a pretty good book not quite what i expected from the reviews, but a good book"
5,This one hits home,"This book really hits home as a story of a grown son and his dad. They plan a final great trip together in the twilight of the dad's life. It is about life and is a great golf story also in that the story is intertwined with the history of golf on a personal basis.My dad is gone so I gave a copy to my son. I also gave a copy to a couple of friends whose fathers are now growing old. They are golfers who learned the game growing up and playing golf with their dads. If you fit this description, I highly recommend this book."
4,Touching,"A father, a son. The closest relationship you will ever find on a golf course, closer than the ball and the hole, is a father and a son. Golf is a game of relationships, thoughts on life. This book summarizes what the game of golf is about. To read it, is to become closer to knowing what the game of golf means. Not just to the author but to yourself. By the end of the reading you will have found the reason why you will die trying to play this profound game. A game the elders named Golf. I promise you, sirs...at the end of this reading, the last thirty pages will be wet with your souls' tears."
5,"More about life and lessons one learns, with golf as a venue","Funny, sad, insightful, and above all, well-written. This is as close as a book gets for men, while still qualifying for the ""Oprah List.""Golf is a metaphor in the hands of the author, who takes us on a final journey between father and son. It is about the lessons one learns in that relationship; golf is simply the vessel for its exploration.Read it if you play golf; read it if you don't. It will touch you nevertheless, and remind you of your past, and make you wonder about your future."
3,Good but could be designed better,"Like many other people have said before me its a great learning toy but the design of the track is flawed. When my son ,who is 16 months, loves to play with this toy and all of its animals, but while he is trying to place the animals in the designated spots he keeps stepping on the track. The track is very narrow so if he tries to sit in the middle of it he hits the buttons on the track so its hard for him to hear what the toy has to say about a certain animal that he want to know about. Example: He takes a penguin and tries to place it on the train station, when he gets it in the spot the station says something about the animal but he steps on the ""L"" pm the track and all he hears is it saying ""Leaf"""
3,Smartville train,The animals are neat! The station is pretty cool. The set up requires the child to sit in the middle of the track or on the track to play with the station. I can't figure out why they made the station so detailed and then threw in a really cheap and flimsy train. The train doesn't really fit the track and tends to derail.
2,Poor Design,This would be a great toy if the train track wasn't set up right in front of the station. Our 18 month old loves to play with all the cool features on the station but has to sit on the track to reach it. Wish there was a way to turn off the track. Right now all you hear is a bunch of noises because the track buttons are going off plus what he is pushing on the station.Caution with older kids that can not reach the station they may break the train track by sitting on it or walking on it to get to the station.
4,Trey's Train Set,"I bought this train set for my one year old as part of his Christmas. Although Trey enjoys this his three year old daughter really loves this toy. We have been using this every night to help her learn to identify the letters on the track. There are alot of things that can be played with on the track, we really like this toy and would recommend it especially for siblings as there is plenty for eveyone to play with."
5,Nice purchase.,This toy may be a little advanced for my 1-1/2 year old but she loves to line up the animals and just pound away on the buttons. My older children like to experiment with the animals and the buttons they are recongnized when placed on. A great purchase at the price we found it at on amazon. It is quite durable for an electronic toy.
3,Lost Interest too Soon,I purchased this for my two grandchildren. One age 13months and One age 2.Neither one of them found this toy interesting or fun. The train has to be moved by hand and I guess mine are two young to find that fun. My youngest plays more with the animals alone than with the train set. The set is very sturdy which Iam glad and easy to take down and put away. They just don't seem interested in this toy too much.
2,badly designed,I agree with many reviews that this toy is poorly designed. Both my kids 2.5 and 1 sit on the railroad track to push the buttons on top and cause a variety of letters and songs to go off w/o any purpose. My 2.5 year old loves to play with animals seperately but doesn't touch the toy otherwise. I would not buy this!
1,Not Leapfrog...,"For some reason I thought that the train was motorized and would travel around the track but unfortunately, that is not the case. The child needs to push it by hand. While doing this, music will start to play and then some of the ABC buttons on the track will go off arbitrarily. It's rather confusing and not very rewarding. The track is not well designed as the child needs to lean over or sit on the track to reach the buttons. I bought this hoping to reinforce alphabet learning but this toy does not deliver. The only way to hear the letters is to press the buttons on the track but the stickers are not very interesting and so get ignored. It seems the most functional part of the toy is identifying the animals yet the animals are rather abstract looking. This toy is very disappointing and not very educational."
2,Suprised the train doesn't move.,"I thought great, a little train toy for my daughter. I was surprised to learn it doesn't move. My daughter is almost 3 and really doesn't have too much interest in it. MY younger daughter 11 months doesn't either. I would say it you buy it, don't spend much money on it."
2,who designed this thing?!,a small child can't easily put the animals in their slot without simultaneously stepping on the talking letters resulting in noisy mayhem. and one of the animal slots isn't easy to reach even for the little hands. this toy would better split up or side by side or for kids with long arms!
1,It was defective,"The concept of the learning tool looked good, however it was defective and after being opened by our grand daughter at Christmas (the box torn etc.) sending it back became a problem."
4,Fiesta Rolling Pin,I bought this item because of trouble rolling dough and a review in the newspaper. I have not tried it out yet on dough but it feels heavy and it is large so I am very excited to try it out when I get a chance. It was delivered very quickly.
3,Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope,"Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and HopeBook was used, in pretty good condition but it was stamped by some library and had a plastic cover that library's use. This may have been legit but it was worrisome. KT"
4,Fabulous Read,"Not only educational but a page-turner! This book is a great read, and does an excellent job of describing what happened with Iran. There is so much we do not understand about their culture and how they got where they are. The scary part is while I was reading this, I couldn't help but worry that it could happen here. The author is a Noble-Peace Prize award winner and an amazing woman who stayed in Iran through so much turmoil. I admire her greatly."
5,The Best for Home Photo Making,"It is hard to find this item in local stores and when it is available, it is very $$$$. Best price on line and best paper."
1,quality of box very disappointing,"Our son received this as a gift, and we sent it back. The box is made of inferior wood, and very poorly constructed. Not really ""constructed"" at all - rather just glued together, and not well, at that. Two of the corners were coming apart.Also, the lid opens in two parts. The drawback: when you open or close either side, the plastic trays on the inside that hold the crayons and pastels, fall out, as there is nothing securing them to the box. So, you have to try to hold the tray in place while closing either side.We can't comment on the supplies themselves, as we did not allow our son to try them, or else he would not have been able to return the item."
4,Daughter loves it...,"My daughter begged for this product so we got it for her as a birthday gift over a year ago. She continue to use it. I just wish it cleaned itself up! Many many pieces. One oddity is that the kit contains oil pastels, and for the life of me I don't know why the makers thought oil pastels were a good idea for a kid to have. (I removed them and put them in a baggie...they can be a real mess!)The packaging is fairly durable and has held up well after a year of torture."
4,GREAT FUN!,"My 9 year old daughter was extremely pleased with this box! She loves the way it's so compact and everything she needs is right there. The only complaint is that the latches are not very sturdy, one already broke off on her the day she got it. But she looks beyond that and enjoys all the supplies she has access to now."
3,"Good value, ok shades","I bought this product after it was featured in Allure. It's a great value for $40 (3 shadows, eyeliner and base). But, i was not impressed with the colors. I expected richer pigment. Great value for $40 if you want brand name cosmetics but I won't be buying anymore of these kits."
1,Looks too dark and fake,"The shadows and eyeliner are, in fact, smooth and very easy to apply and the accompanying instructions a valuable add-on. However, though I used a very tiny amount and applied the shadows with four professional-grade brushes, the result was always too dark. The eyeliner glides easily and smoothly but, as it is black, all it does is add to the overall darkness.I only wish Mally realized not every woman likes black eyeliner and not all of us are after a ""fake"" look or eager to camouflage our own features with dark make-up.Unless this kit comes out with much softer,natural shades, I will not buy again."
1,These are not good books to stimulate your little one,"I can't state enough how incredibly boring these books are. I got them for my son's first birthday, and while he enjoyed the little carrying case they came in- the books wouldn't even hold his attention. He doesn't like that the book is done in under a minute (even with pointing at the pictures and talking about them.) There are only a few pages to each book with short little verses on each page- no real theme or rhyme scheme to speak of. For a newborn-6 months these would be okay, but anything over that is too old. My son had a much better time with Dr. Seuss and Eric Carle books. At least they were more verbally and visually stimulating. I would even go so far as to say that these books made me not want to buy any other Winnie the Pooh books, products- etc for my son."
5,Great product,This item was received in a timely manner and was complete and easy to install with the directions provided. Would highly recommend to others who are mechanically inclined to DIY or can have it installed for them.
5,Hodgson Mills,this is a gerat mix. I made some mini loaves that were soon gone. Can also be used as pizza dough. Consistent quality over all these mixes
1,Not a documentary of Route 66,"This video is not a documentary of Route 66 in New Mexico. Instead, it is a travel video that covers the producer's trip through New Mexico. It misses entirely the old and historic section of Route 66 through Santa Fe. It ignores and does not cover the excellent portion of Route 66 going from Grants to the Arizona border (including all of Route 66 in colorful Gallup). It does show some nice shots of the Albuquerque balloon festival, along with a nice view of the City of Albuquerque from Sandia. I rate this video one star as a documentary of Route 66 in New Mexico and perhaps two stars if you're looking for a travel documentary. If you're looking for a motercycle travel documentary, then you might even give it three to four stars. However, don't expect to get an accurate or complete overview of Route 66 in New Mexico."
1,Very disappointed!,"This video covers a portion of route 66 in New Mexico. It also spends a lot of time on other things, like the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. I was very disappointed that more of route 66 was not covered. All of the old portion of route 66 to Santa Fe is excluded. There is a small amount of coverage about Highway 14, but only up to Sandia Peak for a view of Albuquerque. For some reason, the coverage of route 66 stops in Grants, eventhough Gallup and beyond provides some of the best route 66 views available. All in all, this video is like someone's home movie in both style and quality. You get to see where the producer had time to go, but you don't get the full picture of route 66. If you have never been to New Mexico and you have not traveled route 66, you might think this to be an informative video. If you want a true documentary video with a full overview of route 66 in New Mexico, this is certainly not it!"
4,A worthy effort,"This book reveals a good intent that fell slightly short. The authors evidently know their stuff very well and describe many procedures with meticulousness. However, necessary details are missing on ocassion, like where to locate the vessel they recommend to inject. The illustations are satisfactory but sometimes insufficient. One wonders whether photographs could have been better in these cases. I missed some procedures that are common in veterinary clinics today like x-rays and some small surgery techniques that are common in a clinical setting. For examaple, I would have liked to find some pointers on how to operate an x-ray machine. The book is very useful and well worth buying it, but the authors could make it even better if they surveyed the needs of their colleagues before attempting the next edition."
1,"Taste great, not worth feeling so sick afterwards","The gummy fish do taste like regular sugar gummies, but if you eat only 5- 10 fish, you will end up feeling so sick, it isn't worth eating them. Who eats only one gummy fish? I was afraid to eat more than one afraid I would get sick if I had anymore.I have had other sugar free gummy candies that don't seem to make you feel so awful, not sure what the difference is, but I will never buy these ones again."
1,Pretty lame,"I expected a video that talked about the airplane, its history, performance, etc. All it is is a bunch of repetitive video of a regional airline using G-73s in florida taking off and landing with mininmal narration or information."
5,Great drum for the money$$$,The drum has great tone and the price could not be beat. I got this as a present for someone and loved it so much that I purchased one for myself.
5,"Could be better, but not much","Ever wondered why is it so difficult to put rich data into the relational model, or why so much of database logic keeps being badly manipulated by application programs instead of by DBMS? Ever felt SQL was too verbose, or complex, or illogical, and simply arbitrarily limited? Mr Pascal helps us organise our grips against current DBMSs and hope for a better future.This book analyses common database problems every professional with more than a few months in the field has already faced, and relentlessly trace them to failures in SQL implementations or in the SQL language itself. A real mind-opener in the current state of the field, where from press to shop everything is dominated by vendors but few true critics survive."
5,How to be better at IT than 99% of your peers and managers,"I think the above title is what will happen in your career in IT if you read and understand this book. I personally have made a career almost exclusively at rescuing one dysfuntional/unmaintainable IT system after another, simply by going in and applying the principles and understanding outlined in this and Fabian Pascal's earlier book. And I am regularly given ""GURU of the GURUs"" status for the only reason that I understand and apply these simple principles in IT applications..."
3,Meets expectations for what it's worth,This double disc showcases some of the most popular tracks in Ibiza this past summer which are now finally being played in the clubs here. If you want a decent all around compilation...pick this up.
1,Terrible clock,"My older son has the frog version of this clock, which is a bit loud (we put tape over the speaker), but otherwise ok. THIS monkey clock makes the most awful loud psycho-screaming-monkey noise you can imagine. I can't imagine a worse way to wake up."
5,Something different here!,"I was talking to a friend of mine who has a teen-age grand-daughter who could not wake up in the morning with any wake-up unit of any kind.She said a friend who knows about sleep disorders suggested this and my friend asked to me order it from Amazon for her.I had my doubts when we checked it out but it did work. Her grand-daughter said she hated it but it did wake her up on time.The bummer is I got the last one and I don't know if the others will work.It may have been the high-pitched sound that worked to wake her up, I would need something with a much lower pitched sound."
3,cute but loud,"Beware, the alarm on this clock is the sound of a screeching howler monkey. It terrified my kids when they heard it go off (at 1:30 am, no less). It's very cute, but the alarm is horrible. I wish there were a way to disconnect it."
4,Responding to Northern Lights,I have not read the book yet but I have read the captions from your review and by your response I believe that most of what John has said you have not understood and/or truly let in.Try again.
5,Help when you need it,Timely book. I'm a baby boomer and my parents are winding down their lives. This is really helpful.
5,as valid today as 72 years ago,This slim volume is the text of a lecture Klee delivered in 1924 on the occasion of the opening of a museum exhibit of modern art. It is both an educational lecture on color and form and an explanation of modern art that largely escapes being a defense. Klee's discourse is not simply an historical piece. It is as valid today as it was when he delivered it seventy-two years ago. Klee was Kandinsky's neighbor during the years they both taught at the Bauhaus. They shared more than the basement that connected their duplex apartments; they shared a belief in art as a spiritual pursuit.
1,it is a disappointment,"nothing to do with the real stuff.his spanish pronunciation is not good,he changes the mood and rhythm in some songs to such a point it becomes impossible to recognize it, like in the case of HEY"
5,Nice condom,"I liked this product a lot. They are pretty thin, stretchy and allow for a good sensation. I tried the other ones from Durex - Sensi Thin, and they are very bad in comparison to those."
4,Manual of Tropical Housing and Building,"This book shows us the possible solutions to design and make houses in the tropical climates. There are special problems in these regions, so we can not copy the ordinary houses that are made in other climates in these hot climates. We need special knowledge to build houses and other buildings in these areas. In this book we can learn several solutions to rich this goal. The book could be a reference in climatic design and also in environmental design. It contents some sections like: climate, comfort, principles of thermal design, means of thermal control, light and lighting, noise and noise control, application, design aids and bibliography.As an architecture student who focus on thermal comfort in hot and dry climate, I recommend this book."
5,* Warning * Same concert as Soundstage....,"This don't look good. Just got my copy of Foreigner Live. Looks like the exact same concert as Soundstage, lol... Exact length and setlist too (105 Mins). No wonder there was little info on were/ when this concert was shot. The back cover has the same pic's as Soundstage disk too. I'm thinking, I'll return the item."
5,I'm a big fan of foreigner.,Great concert video! Nothing more needs to be said. I need nine more words. Just three more words. Great Wonderful!
3,KELLY HANSEN HAS SUCH A STRONG VOICE !!,"IF YOU LIKE FOREIGNER THEN THIS COLLECTION WILL KEEP YOU VERY HAPPYI'M A BIG FAN OF DTS SOUND AND THIS ONE DELIVERS A GREAT PERFORMANCEMY COLLECTION INCLUDES MANY BANDS FROM THE 70S AND EIGHTIESI AM ALWAYS AMAZED AT HOW GOOD THE EAGLES DTS FORMAT STILL ISBASED ON A REFERANCE STANDARD THEY ARE STILL HARD TO BEATLIVE RECORDINGS MUST BE THE MOST CHALLENGINGWOILD I BUY THIS BLU RAY AGAIN ?BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE ONE OF FOREIGNER THEN YES I PROBABLY WOULDIF YOU ARE A FAN OF BOZ SCAGGS THE PICK UP BOSS SCAGGS GREATEST LIVE HITSIT IS ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDING DTS CONCERTS I HAVE EVER HEARDWHOEVER MIXED THIS ,AND THE EAGLES HELL FREEZES OVER AND THE FAREWELL TOUR ARE VERY TALENTED PEOPLE"
1,FOREIGNER,"i THOUGHT THIS WAS THE REPLACEMENT FOR THE LEAD SINGER, i WAS DISSAPOINTED, THIS WAS NOT WHAT iTHOUGHT IT WOULD BE.MICHAEL EBERHARDT"
3,So-so,"I love Foreigner, the band, the songs, but the audio and video quality is not so great, nor is the performance."
3,Good intro to Oracle 10g for Linux,"As an experienced Oracle DBA, I wanted a nice text that covers Linux specifics to Oracle 10g. This book is okay not perfect but the only real Oracle 10g for Linux book on the market.Good1. RAC coverage is decent2. Linux tuning for Oracle is niceBad1. Data Guard coverage is very weak2. No workarounds for installation issues with Linux and OracleSo I give it 3 stars because its not bad but not great. I hope that the other Linux for Oracle RAC book that comes out next year is better."
3,"Just ""OK""","Covers a wide range of topics, but lacks detail in many. Most of the topics covered are not specific to the LINUX operating system. It would be nice if the book covered specific topics / issues related to Linux, and skipped the basic administration topics that are not specific to Linux."
2,no useful information,"Before I bought this book I read its table of contents and I found it wery interesting for me. But when I started reading it I found very few concreate informations in this book. A lot of repeated sentences, a lot of general informations. If you would like to learn something useful about Oracle implementation in Linux try another book."
5,Everday Greens cookbook,"I got this cookbook for my daughter who is a vegetarian and loves to cook.The recipes are great, easy and delicious! The only addition needed is more pictures."
3,Running out of steam?,"This is a beautifully produced book, and I couldn't resist buying it to complete my Greens collection, but there isn't a whole lot that's new or different, as far as I can tell."
4,Magnamorphs Rule!,"We have a bunch of these magnamorphs and my kids love them. They combine dinosaurs with the bugs, animals & sea creatures. Very fun toy - highly recommend."
3,Knife Defense,"Good basic knife defenses using the ""control weapon limb and strike"" protocol.Filmed outdoors and in a situational format that makes it a little more realisticin terms of actual environments and more interesting to watch.Neither instructor speaks English so the entire dvd is narrated in English.Most of the defenses are simple and practical with only a few being questionable.I would recommend this instructional dvd."
4,Steamy!,"Classic Nin -- steamy, seductive poetic writing with ample plot twists and turns. As in real life, sensuality and love is never easy."
1,Not so impressed,"I bought this lactic acid for my husband who has a small dark spot.Well, he used it 3 times, and he broke out exactly on the spot where he put the product, I am sure it was the lactic acid that made him break out because he was putting it only on that spot and the zit popped ONLY on that spot (he usually doesn't get random zits on his face).Very disappointing, I wish I could contact Skin Laboratory but seems like their ""contact page"" doesn't work.Well, if you see this review please contact me, I am extremely disappointed by your product and would like to send it back for a refund."
3,"Russell in prime form, but with caveats...","First, Russell is amazing in this concert. Perhaps not his best voice (due to its taping at the end of a long tour), but the orchestra and venue is superb. Sound mixing is excellent.Second, the filming is decent but not great. The camera cuts MUCH too much away from Russell and to the crowd and orchestra. We should be seeing Russell most of the time but the camera is constantly cutting away...annoying.Finally, this is a PAL DVD. This means that if you are in North America, you MUST have a DVD that can play and out PAL or the DVD won't play. It will play on your PC, but that's not an ideal presentation. The DVD is multi-region though.This DVD is not as good or as engaging as his Auckland concert, this is an older and more polished entertainer that knows his audience and plays to his strengths."
4,Belkin is Belkin,If your looking for some kind of cable that is not made by your favorite cable supplier your always safe going Belkin. It is one of the biggest suppliers of all kinds of cable so you can count on quality. You may be able to find the same cable you need at a lower price but at what sacrifice of quality.
1,Very basic tips,"Mostly tips for limit texas holdem, very little on no limit. Very basic level tips, not as good as i thought it would be"
5,"Good service, good product","I have a Gateway Laptop computer. Currently I had a problem with it, I took it to a Laptop repair center, the total charge for parts and labor - $250. I was able to fix it for +/- $60, not a bad deal. Thanks to the Amazon partner. Good service and a good product!"
3,Sign language classic childrens' books,"I really wanted this DVD to be great, but it missed the mark. The signers take up almost the whole screen. They stand in front of the pages, not at the side. The stories are well chosen, but my hearing children want to see the pictures, and they aren't picking up sign language. I think it would have worked better if the signers had been off to the side, the way the words on a page don't interfere with the pictures."
4,Great tool for any child!,I love the scholastic signing videos for my two sons with autism! My son loves to watch the people sign and I learn the signs while watching along. When we try to recount the story my son is helped along with my signing the next word to remind him rather than speaking. I believe the signing aids in his comprehension of the stories and the stories are well chosen. They also love Goodnight moon and Five little monkeys!
2,Not as good as regular thickness Thorlo's,"First, I have been running in Thorlos for 4 years and can say that I believe their claim that their socks reduce blisters and provide shock absorption - in fact I would say they do this very effectively! However, the mini-lite product is not as effective as the regular thickness version, in both blister prevention or shock absorption. In fact, they pretty much feel like any other sock. In my view, they are not worth the extra price over any other fitted running sock, many of which you can buy for about half the price as the Thorlos."
5,just perfect,"i bought to put on my home gym. the material quality is good, the picture has good resolution, perfect to remember wich muscle you should stretch before an exercise. it couldnt be better. i recomend."
2,Not his best,"Elmore Leonard has been lauded as America's greatest living crime writer and having read all of his crime books, I can see why. However, Bandits is clearly not one of Leonard's better works. Leonard claims that he never knows how his books will end, that he lets the characters lead him. In the case of Bandit's it they do not lead him to any strong finish. The characters are always the best part of any Leonard novel, and this cast is rather boring.In an earlier review, a reader commented that this was an ""issue"" book and cited both Pagan Babies and Cat Chaser as being in the same category. While Pagan Babies (an excellent read) and Cat Chaser (also good) may have both had issues or causes woven into the story, neither of these suffered from the boring cast of characters and slow moving plot that Bandits did. Fortunately this kind of disappointment is rare with Leonard's works."
3,"Dialog, dialog, dialog","Superficially, ""Bandits"" is a caper novel, and not a particularly good one. What saves it is Leonard's characters and especially their dialog. Ignore the plot -- Just sit back, relax, observe, and in particular listen to the characters."
2,Am I missing something here...?,"Drawn by the setting of New Orleans, I gave this one a shot. Decent refernces to businesses and landmarks, but HORRRIBLE plot line. (Unless, again, I'm missing something here...) Seems like Leonard had a gun to his head to finish this book, quickly! I've read Delillo, Pynchon, Sandford, etc...and recommend ANY of them over what I saw from Leonard here."
3,In your list of...........,".............crummy books, you can add this one. Three stars because of the cute writing. The story line sucks."
4,Here's How He Does It. . .,"Elmore Leonard has an ear for character. He usually starts with a bad good guy and immediately adds a 'good' and very desirable woman. Then we meet one or two really bad guys and a couple of less good good guys. There's usually a not-so-good desirable woman and one or two totally off-the-charts whackos.This is not to say that Leonard writes to a formula. It's just that he, like Jimmy Breslin and Vladimir Nabokov Walter Moseley and a few dozen others, returns to the people he loves.His characters in this book are well-drawn. Jack and Lucy are the heart of the matter-the bad good guy and the good hot woman. They are involved with sleazeleeches who are hustling American right-wingers for cash under pretext of fighting communists in Central America. The action is a bit slow, but the characters and the suspense make up for it.Lynn Hoffman, author of Bang Bang"
4,A superior novel of it's genre.,"An ex-nun teams up with with some ex-cons to rip-off an evil'contra' colonel who's in the U.S. raising funds to wage war against the Sandinistas. The characters of Sister Lucy, Jack Delaney, Roy Hicks, and Franklin de Dios are all interestingly drawn. Each of these characters is asked to pick a side and to remain committed to it. Amidst the hardboiled dialogue and the steamy New Orleans setting, there's a moving discourse on St. Francis of Assisi. The chaste love between Jack and 'Sister' Lucy is tenderly drawn. To give the book balance, the Sandinistas don't come across as angels (which they weren't). The book is also graced with wit and humor. The IRA and the CIA are thrown in to spice things up a bit. It's a fun read that raises important issues that lift it above the average mystery / suspense fare."
2,Why would someone pay for a book that has stickers all over it?,"I purchased this NEW book for a friend in Europe. When I got this book their was a ""book sticker"" on the front cover of the book, one that I could not peal off without damaging the book and yet another sticker on it's binding. Who ever send me this book, with a big sticker covering it's title, must not know much about packaging a book. Please replace this book with one that truly is NEW!"
3,Chain of Command - a rambling story,"I bought this book after listening to Mr. Hersh give a talk on US foreign policy and Obama. Just as his talk was series of rambling stories and opinions, the book also seems to ramble on. I respect and admire his investigative journalism. I think the book shows the bright and insightful results of his work. Had I not listened to his talk I would not have bought the book. I am glad I bought the book and had it autographed. THat alone makes it worth more than the list price that I paid."
4,otra obra maestra de un singular artista,"Seguidor de este grande de Europa y del mundo, admiro mas su obra mas antigua cada vez que disfruto con su presente porque muestra la conducta de una personalidad y un estilo propio, una sensibilidad especial aunque su imagen exterior pueda parecer la de un ser un duro."
4,fishing the high country,You can count on all of Geirach's books being a hit. Good sense of humor and great cabin reading for me.
4,Perfect for small spaces,I had a small window on an entry door that I needed to cover. This was inexpensive and worked well.
5,One of the best equitation books out there!,"This book is great for riders of all skill levels. All techiques and concepts are explained well and in an interesting and informative manner. Mrs. Jane Marshall Dillon had an excellent riding school, where I spent many summers riding, teaching lessons and working around the barn. I sure learned alot from her and her book!"
5,Dragonball Z Fusion Reborn/Wrath of the Dragon,"Great storyline, packed with action. Very good item to collect for any Dragon Ball Z fan. Wish there were more to this set. Thanks for a great product!"
5,Fusion and Wrath,"Fusion reborn is by far my favorite DBZ movie, Goku and Vegeta, with the aide of Pikkon fight against a new enemy, while the barrier between the other world and the human world is down, Gohan and Videl fight off past enemies, Hercule actually fighting and winning! And a hilarious fight between Trunks and Goten against a cartoon version of Hitler.Wrath of the Dragon that last released movie in English, so far, is great. Shows how Trunks gets his sword."
2,PQ review!!,Look i know the films are old and they weren't preserved that well but i feel funimation could of done allot more to clean the films picture up there's way to much grain.
2,"Awasome Movies, terrible edition!","The movies are old, but im a big fan of DBZ, so when i see it in BD i buy it in a blink. But i really dont understand why nobody say this is NOT a remaster edition, the japanese audio is horrible, and the image is just and upsacle of a dvd. I live in onether country, so i can not demand a refound, but f you read this, wait for a real remaster edition. I recomend you search in a japanese web store first, if you can find it there, forget to gat it here. I am very disapointed."
3,Its OK,These two features are Ok they don't fit into the DBZ time line very well so my little critic son was not happy about that . The final fights go fast almost anti climatic . Also one of the DVDs did not work well on toshiba players but on my RCA it is fine.
5,"Dee Lundgren Christian Counselor Langhorne, PA",As a professional counselor and mother who lost her oldest son at the young age of 22 this book ministered to the core of my heart. The book is all about worshipping God on the road marked with suffering. There is something so profound when one sings this song as an act of worship with tears in your eyes. There is a deep sense of God being pleased with this type of worship. In an age in which praise songs can lack substance in times of intense pain this book and song ministers to the the felt needs of people in their times of deepest grief.
5,Is There No Other Way?: The Search for a Nonviolent Future,"THis is one of the best books I've ever read on nonviolence. It is very well-written and contains a good balance between nonviolence principles and Nagler's stories and personal anecdotes. Nagler well explains and illustrates nonviolence principles. His stories and examples are apt and useful. Nagler argues convincingly for both the principles and the efficacy of nonviolence in the world today. Most highly recommended, especially in the extreme levels of violence we live in today."
5,always a fan of Gossip Girl,"Probably my favorite of all six seasons. The show really comes into it's own this season, as do the characters."
5,I like it.,"GossipGirl, in my opinion, is a great show. I love the characters, and their back stories. I love how everything is eventually 'outted'. It's a great show."
3,floundered a bit,"The first half of this season was phenomenal. The way Chuck's dad was killed and the entire roller coaster of emotions was very well acted but somewhere towards the end it got weird and confusing and it seemed everyone was sleeping with everyone. Completely killed my fire for the show in the final episodes and then the writers seemed to want to correct and clean up everything in the last episode which was great but rushed and patched together. There's a few characters this show can do without like Vanessa, the stars continue being Chuck and Blair as they steal each scene they're in. Jenny's character also got weird and detached. I dont think I will watch this show further as it felt like it left at a good place."
5,One of the best shows on television,"I hardly ever buy tv shows on dvd, but this one is a must. It shipped quickly too. I love watching it."
5,This show is the best,"I bought the first season before even seeing the show on television first and i couldn't take a break to sleep, this season was the exact same. More twists, and the quality of the dvds was perfect. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes this show."
5,Best Show Ever,Okay this is the best show ever - ever monday night i get together with friends and watch the episode and it always leaves us speechless - the show is better then sex and the city - it keeps up with all the latest trends and really creates a great drama show - i cannot express how much i love this show - i look for spoilers and cannot wait til new episodes come out - i am immediatly perked up whenever brings up gossip girl and i am so happpy season 3 is on the way it is sure to be bigger and better
3,"Broken cover, scratched box art. Great Season","I bought season 2 for 36$ at Wal-mart and when I got home to open it, I unwrapped the plastic to find that the case was shattered and the discs were everywhere. The Box was even scratched. It is evident that it was used. All in all, it had entertaining episodes and the quality of the playback was amazing. When upscaled (in 1080p), it looked better than the HD broadcast (in 1080i).Details:-Widescreen (1.78:1 - Complete screen is filled)-7 Discs- English 5.1- Subtitled in English, French, etc."
5,AWESOME 2ND SEASON!!!!,"this season was great. every time an episode would end, it would always leave you sitting on the edge of your seat. I personally could not wait for mondays. it always left me with the ""oh cant believe this"", ""aww so cute"", ""DAMN"", etc. It always kept you guessing plus it always made you want more and they achieved that. i honestly can not wait for the third season since they did leave a hook.GREAT SHOW!!!!"
2,Case internals broken,"The DVDs were delivered on time, but the plastic inside was broken and the DVDs were moving around loosely. Luckily, none of the DVDs were scratched."
2,Missing Disk,In my set of Gossip Girl out of the 7 disks the second one was replaced with disc one. I had two disc ones and missed out on what felt like some major parts of the series. Skipping the second disc and going onto the third I was confused with where the story left off. That was the only problem with my set.
1,to much $ for me,"ok let me start by saying you need at least $200 to shell out if you want to use these cards. you need to buy 2 gameboy advance (sp if desiresd), super mario 3 for gameboy advance, an e-reader, a gameboy sp link cable and this pack of cards of corce. why would nintend make it such a hassle to buy all of this wen they could of easaly made all these features avalable on the game? They wont people to shell out all the money they can to make their game a bit better. If you have all these items id buy if if you dont id forget all about it. i was gonna buy it till i found out evry thing i needed. The hassle of haveing two gameboys on your lap swiping cards to wach some guy at nintendo play a level, or to cheat is just not worth it. If you wanna cheat do your self a favor and buy GameShark SP(on ebgames.com $20, not on amazon), or GameBoy Advance Action Replay($20) ."
4,Dynamite Party CD,"Having picked up this disc for a budget price in the BP service station on the M6 (nr Preston, Northbound) I was expecting the cheesy party hits of my youth. I was not disappointed. From Superman to Agadoo, this a platter that cannot fail to make you laugh, singalong & boogie. Solid gold."
4,Hearing it again after many years and liking it more.,"I knew Peter when he recorded this album. I was very young, just up from Virginia. Peter taught me history books lied. I had never heard of Ira Hayes. I have now. I bought this CD a year ago and I heard it through older ears. I realized how wonderful it is musically and lyrically. It is serious and funny. I wish Peter was still here. This CD can tell you things you never knew if you just listen."
4,Good book,Easy to understand and interestingly not boring. Since the book is 12 years old its a little out of date but still a good informational manual.
4,A very good reference book for beginner and experience technician,"It started from the basic fundamental of fiber optics its uses, termination, safety, testing , documenting and upto its application"
3,Putco Ion Chrome LED 3rd Brake Light,"The light looks great. It was very to install - less than 5 minutes. The brake light is bright but the cargo bed light is very dim for a LED light. I am disappointed about that. Overall, the light is good but, over priced!"
1,WASTE OF GOOD ACTORS,WATERDANCE WAS A DEPRESSING STORY ONLY GOOD THING WAS HELEN HUNT BIG NAME ACTORS BUT NOT A GOOD STORY SORRY
2,The Waterdance,Early Helen Hunt. Basically this is a film about a room full ofmen learning how to live physically challenged. Helen Hunt is tornbetween two lovers. She's pretty convincing. I seriously doubt I'd view this film more than once. The film moves very slowly and lacks character development. You basically know nothing about the two lead characters other than the fact they're sexually involved with each other and Eric Stoltz broke his neck hiking. The ending leaves you wondering...what happens now? The best scenes were the love scenes involving Helen Hunt and Eric Stolz. The love scene in the hospital takes the cake.....very well done.
4,Cheap and Great,"I don't think you can get a better laptop for the price. I've had mine for over a year and it still runs great. I didn't get it to be a desktop replacement. I take it on vacation and it connects effortlessly via whatever WiFi signal is available. Yes, it did come with Vista, but I knew that when I bought it."
2,Boogie Woogie?,Sent this back as the voice over piano was poor and this album is more Blues than Boogie Woogie piano.Very dissappointed.
5,A work of art in words and pictures,"""Out in the cool blue sea, a mother dolphin just gave birth."" With those words Kevin Maloney begins a tale of a dolphin's adventure in the underwater wilderness. Blues devotion to the teachings of his parents is his means to survival. Is Blue not just like all of us? Only those who have not experienced the love Blue has would scoff at this concept and nor would they understand it!This is a tender tale sure to bring a child closer to the ones who offer true love and protection; their mothers and fathers."
3,It's O.K.,"Compare to the others Estopa CD's this is not as good as the others, I feel like they fall in to a formula, but I listen to the next one wich is Voces de Ultratumba and I feel they make a better work , my advice is to skip this one from your collection. Viva España!"
4,John Angotti Live,My entire family loves this album. We listen to it over and over and never tire of John's wonderful voice and inspiring lyrics.
4,Nursing Book,This book came to me in great shape and on time too! I could not ask for better. Thanks A lot!
3,"Phrases hard to locate, but helpful","This book contains many useful Swahili phrases, but they are rather specific. And there's no explanation of Swahili grammar or the structure of the language. This isn't the book to get if you want to understand exactly how each phrase fits together, but if you just need things to say when conversing with a Swahili-speaker, this book contains common phrases that will help you get your point across. But it takes some reading through, since the index will usually direct you to the wrong phrase or section of the book."
3,Decent treats according to my tasters,"These are good treats, small and crunchy. Unfortunately the packaging is defective. We have bought at least 10 or more packages over the last 6 months and none of them can be resealed. They have the zip strip but it does not work. When we first open the bag the cats gobble them down but turn their noses up at them when the bag gets about 1/2 used. We have tried sealing with a clip and that has helped though the more finicky cat still will not eat these treats after the bag has been open for a few days.eta-Note that this review is for bags of treats. They keep substituting the canister picture which probably closes fine."
2,Not quite what i expected,"This small book by Lebbeus Woods( the size is a plus compared to other publications of his opus) isn't his best publication.Woods is a really interesting subject, both his texts and draftings, explore the limits of architecture, and the concept behind projecting architecture.This book does not show neither to a good extent.The text at the start is quite short, and the drawings... they look photocopied from some other anthologies already published.There are better books of Lebbeus Woods around, this one is forgettable."
2,Not bad,"If your a fan of low budget B horror movies, then you will feel right at home. I did not expect much out of this movie but it wasn't half bad. On a B movie scale I give it a 6 (out of 10)."
5,Good acting,"This movie sounds silly but it is well-written and the acting is amazing, especially given that every actor is an up-and-coming star. The plot is very hard to follow, though, so pay very close attention or you will miss something. Watch out for the twist ending that will blow your mind."
2,Warning . .,"Do not watch this movie while operating heavy machinery as it tends to make you nod off. Definitely one of the lesser forms of filmmaking and not historically accurate from any point of view, which makes it's reason for being an inconclusive mystery. If it were on the comic edge it might of helped, but the take is a serious nature on a ridiculous premise."
1,Abraham Lincoln Zombie Hunter.,This movie was dead on arrival. They should have paid me to watch it. That is 90 minutes of my life wasted.
1,I can't believe this,I watched this movie an right away I could tell this was not going to be good. The zombies looked liked they were dressed for (Holloween)it was not believeable. I'm always on the hunt for a good zombie films something that aleast looks (REAL)something that could actually happen. Out of all the low buget and terrible zombie movies this make number 2 on my list. I couldn't believe it actually made it too thearters to buy this wow.I went to sleep on it was so terrible. I WOULD NOT WATCH THIS AGAIN!
3,"Abe, Stonewall Jackson, Abe love affair Madam, zombies and more.","(1) Not a zombie fan. (2) Title seemed so ridiculous had to rent and watch. (3)Not sure what I expected but perhaps some camp, some humor, but this is a serious movie. I had no idea Abe's mom was a zombie and that he went on special missions himself. Lots of Civil War names, references. Overall good production values other than sound being a little off now and again. Watch it?? Don't recommend."
1,ABRAHAM LINCOLN VS ZOMBIES,"HORRIBLE MOVIE WITH HORRIBLE ACTING. EVEN THE MAKEUP, ESPECIALLY THE BEARDS LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GLUED ON. I COULD NOT WATCH MORE THAN 30 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE. IT WAS REALLY BAD."
2,Not well done,"This movie is only for the curious-and should be rented not purchased. You'll only need to see it once. I don't mind ""mash-ups"" of history with science fiction horror,but this movie is not well done. The costumes were very poorly done. Some of the uniforms-particularly General Jackson's-looked like cheap outfits you buy at a Halloween store. Of course, the history is all wrong. It seems they didn't even try to get it right. I do like the actor who portrays Lincoln, but he wasn't enough to salvage the film. I think the storyline could have been a winner, but the opportunity has been missed with this effort."
5,ALVZ,"Great movie. Much bettter than Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter tis works on so many levels, horror comedy, alternative history. well worth the price. Could be a cult classic"
4,Great B Movie!!!,"I myself liked the story line better than Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, that was a good movie but this one just seemed to catch me a little better for some reason. I think it it had the backing it could have been a better one than Vamprie Hunter. The zombies were well done. Lincoln Rocked and the whole movie was just totally enjoyable to watch. So to me Abe vs Zombies Really Kicks Butt!!!"
3,Another The Asylum classic,It is what it is.Not bad for the price.Need to find the newer releases by them to ad to my collection.
1,Disappointing,We rented this movie thinking it be kind of scary kind of funny. It was neither. I started checking my email on my phone after 20 minutes. I don't know how or why we watched the whole thing.
5,"""Emancipate THIS!""",The History Channel missed out on this one.I knew when i first read this title in would be a great movie...and it was. Great historical drama. Bill Oberst Jr. steals the show as Honest Abe. This movie addresses some unkwown historical facts:^) What truly happened to Stonewall Jackson? How did Pat Garrett get his start before Billy the Kid? Who really inspired Theodore Roosevelt's famous slogans? What was the true story behind the Lincoln assassination? Watch this movie and find out. Keep an eye out for the zip line scene...btw I found this dvd at my local (red)+(box)....Enjoy!
1,TWO THUMBS DOWN,Bill Oberst Jr. did a fine job portraying Lincoln. And there is actually the germ of a good idea in this script. But the cheap special effects kill it. I've seen more realistic looking zombies at teenage Halloween parties. PASS.
1,Bad is Bad,Give me a camera and a few friends and I could make a better movie. The only plus was the actor who played Lincoln. He was believable and a little creepy.
1,Terrible Movie,I love zombie movies of all types. Even if they a low budget as most of them are. This is just bad all around and mind you I am not that picky. I am sorry I spent my money on this.
1,No subtitle!,I was exciting to watch the movie but realizing that movie is not coming with subtitle! So actually I throw in trash.
5,Emancipate THIS!!!!,"First off, this is a fantastic movie, funny as all hell. If you're looking for a movie that's historically accurate, then this isn't it. This is just a goofy movie to have fun with. You can't take it so seriously, it's just a fun popcorn flick.It seems that President Lincoln has to ""go behind enemy lines"" to see what happened to some of his men. It turns out that Lincoln is soon (with his assault team) hip deep in zombies, and it's up to Abe to kick some zombie butt! Not only does Abe kick zombie butt, he has some great one liners, and one escape scene had me in stitches. Abe even hooked up with some famous people from history to help him with his fight against the undead.All kidding aside, I'm not sure why there are so many low ratings. You have to take the movie for what it's worth; a good movie that's a great escape. Just kick back and enjoy."
4,crazy good fun,I really enjoyed this movie. Old Abe swings a mean scythe. Just plain silly. Not for someone looking for serious zombie drama.
3,I love zombies but....,"I really love zombie movies, and out of the 30+ that I have, I would rate it in my bottom 5. The general plot of the movie is ok, but the acting is weak, dialogue sounds like it was recorded in a gym, even when they are supposed to be outside. The action/gore is plentiful even though almost all cgi. It needed more actual blood. Even my Mexican and Greek dubbed zombie movies have less cgi and more actual (fake)blood. Good ole Abe is well made up, and the ending was a nice twist. Don't waste your money on the blue ray, maybe the regular dvd price may make it seem like less of a cheap rip off."
1,This movie company should learn some originality,"You're better off seeing the real deal Abraham Lincoln movie ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter."" This Asylum movie company should be punished by learning how to write original movies instead of ""mock busters."" A parody is one thing, but a ""mock buster."" I'm gonna go see the real thing tonight. Asylum, please learn some originality."
1,horrible,what was good about this movie? there was nothing good at all. These ratings should not be this high. Do not waste your time.
3,History you will never hear about,"Many would saw not a campy horror flick, I say hog wash! Delightfully campy in a ""Woods"" kind of way."
4,I really really wanted to hate this movie,"But I couldnt. This was actually a pretty decent flick. I havent seen the vampire one so I cant compare it but the story was a lot better then I had expected and the .07 cents I paid to watch it was well worth it. Seriously, this is a movie to watch when you want to have fun. It reminds me of a lot of horror movies I used to watch in the early 90s from Charles Band and the Troma guys. I enjoyed it from beginning to the end."
4,Nick Brennan loved this book.,"This was a fantastic book! It was two books in one, a great deal.In th first part Nick and Tim are asked by an American man to try and find out what happened to Lenny Smiles, the mysterious man that he had donated millions to. As the truth unravels esplosions, gunfights, and car chases frequent the pages.In the second section they are in Paris. They meet a mysterious steward who gives them a package of sugar while trying to tip them off about a drug smuggling ring between France and Britain. Police, sweet sellers, and Texas oil entrepuners are the new friends here.In the final section a reunion with a classmate becomes a weekend chalk full of murders and memories.This is an awsome book and should top you or beloved's Christmas list!!"
5,Fun to Stack,"Bill Ding wooden balancing clowns have been around since the 1930s. You get nine clowns that are about 4 1/2 inches tall (2 red, 2 green, 2 blue, 2 yellow, 1 white). The clowns' feet, arms, shoulders, heads, etc are such that they can hook together so that you can stack them up or sideways. The challenge is to find new ways to stack them without them falling over. It's amazing the various ways that you can stack these things. You might consider buying two sets to stack them even higher. Overall, they are well made and fun to play with."
5,Bill Ding:,"These are wooden clowns that can be stacked in many positions and provide hours of fun for all ages. My mother got them when I was a child, (many years ago!) and they are still in good condition. She keeps them out and when she has young visitors they always enjoy playing with them. I assumed that they no longer were sold and was delighted to find them on Amazon. Now I can have them for my young friends when they visit as well. They are colorful and sturdy and fun. You will never regret buying them!"
1,Really boring,Don't waste your time and money on this book; it is really boring. The two people who gave it good reviews must have been the author's parents. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
5,NT Wright's alter ego,"NT Wright - scholar, bishop of Durham, Colbert Report veteran - is publishing a new series of ""light"" commentaries..the ""for Everyone"" series, under the appropriately Common nomer ""Tom Wright"" (they started out with ""NT Wright"" and moved later to just ""Tom"" on the covers).You will rarely get a better, easier reading, more accessible commentary that is helpful both for preachers and laity. Passages are broken down into devotional-length analysis and comment, with a small bit of application as sort of ""starter dough"" for the reader.DONT use this to write your thesis.DO use this to be more effective at explaining scripture, leading a small group, or engaging other in dialogue regarding Pauline literature."
3,Silver water pitcher/Reed & Barton,"This pitcher is worth the money, as it is economically priced.It is plain and classic in design. It is sold as Reed & Barton but is unmarked and definitely not an heirloom.The pitcher would make a nice medium-priced gift. It does have an ice guard,and it comes in a plain box ready to wrap. I would list this product as a Gift."
2,Not so great!,I love Melissa & Doug floor puzzles! This puzzle is not so great though. It's way too busy and does not go together well. It also had pieces that were not cut.
4,Harriett the Homeless Raccoon,"Harriett is old enough now to live on her own. But where does a raccoon find a home? She looks all over, finally settling in the attic of a house. But soon she's caught and put in a shed. More trouble ensues and she makes an escape. What adds to this simple story for kids four to eight years old are the illustrations. Much of the story is gleaned through pictures so young readers can add to the story, making it come alive a little more every time it's read. Two pages of natural history about raccoons will engage young minds even more."
2,Descriptive gay sex within a weak mystery novel,A gay man trying to solve a snuff photo mystery is a twist on the movie 8mm and has promise. The descriptions of the auction business is somewhat interesting. The author pulls a red herring on us that will make a tense but unsatisfactory movie climax. Too much of the book is devoted to describing gay sex. This book is more a curiosity than the great work many reviewers describe.
1,Gay porn and weak plot,"I feel that the rave reviews from media and readers are totally wrong, and it's not because I am against a gay hero. He is an unhappy auctioneer who goes for casual sex, but the story is weak (more a thriller than a whodunnit), improbably, and stumbles along.Along the way, the hero sees a young (man) in a window who longs to be seduced and goes up to his room. This is written in a *very* graphic way, and the boy does not appear anywhere else in the book. Hero Rile makes passes at another character, Derek, whose role in the book is also a big question mark.The story of hero Rilke finding snuff pictures of a girl and becoming so upset by them that he goes on a quest for the solution is not believable, and not well executed."
2,full of holes.,"I thought this had a promising premise--a man from an auction house hired to sell the estate of a dead millionaire discovers ""snuff"" pictures--sounded interesting, albeit familiar to moviegoers who saw ""8 mm"". And the main character, the auctioneer, was unusual for this kind of novel: a middle-aged gay guy who prowls public parks.But the book was stronger on incident and character than it was on real plot and the twist at the end (I won't reveal it), was full of holes: think about it for a minute and it completely falls apart. And, in the end, the book relied on thematics in order to wrap up, in an unsatisfying way, what should have been wrapped up with good old fashioned storytelling.One final caveat: the book is set mainly in Scotland and the brogue sometimes appeared, at least to this American, to take the form of typos. It was occasionally distracting."
3,weak plot,"There is none of the interesting, arresting writing the NY times book review mentioned present in this book, it reads like an unfinished painting, sorry not to be reommened, highly disappointed!"
4,Crime and Punishment Glasgow Style,"Not my usual read, but thoroughly gripping... It's about a Glaswegian auctioneer who gets involved in trying to work out the provenance of some old necrophilic photos he finds in an old mansion. These photos unite unsavoury deeds from the past with present day ills and our protagonist deftly manages his investigation despite (and sometimes thanks to) his own set of vices and dubious acquaintances.Welsh's style is reminiscent of fellow Scot, Iain Banks, but her prose is more poetic with more frequent allusions to literature, beginning chapters with dark little quotes from figures such as Poe and Rimbaud.Once you get into this one, you'll burn through the pages. An intelligent, original novel."
5,Thumbs Up,"We had an autumn dinner party on our new patio last night - BLTs made with homegrown tomatoes, pie from our apple tree. To ward off the chill, we lit our first fire in the chiminea. It draws well and burns wood efficiently, providing warmth and the incomparable beauty and delight of a real wood fire. It does gas off its finish on first use, but that vaguely chemical smell lingers for only 10 minutes or so. Assembly is a breeze. I really like this product."
2,Changes color,I used mine 5-6 times. It sits outside and it is now white. I don't know what it is but it started with with dots and it spread.
3,Louis Jordan at age 65,"Alto saxophonist and singer Louis Jordan was still sounding good when these later-career stereo sides were recorded. For the majority of this set, Jordan does new takes on such 1940s swing and big band faves as ""Take The 'A' Train, ""Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?,"" ""Caldonia"" and ""Saturday Night Fish Fry."" The album's title track, I BELIEVE IN MUSIC, is a bluesy cover of a then-current Top 40 song.Includes commentary written for the original LP, thus no mention of the last six bonus tracks is made. These half-dozen non-vocal cuts may be the best that this album has to offer. The sound quality here is fine, yet Jordan's monaural 1930s and '40s DECCA recordings seem fresher, somehow. Recommended only for those interested in hearing Louis Jordan in full range stereo. (3 stars)TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 63:03"
5,Three Thumbes up,I bought the book from daniel shortly after he published it. In that time i have read it six times. It is a great book that combines science-fiction with a political twist a great book which should be read by any science-fiction fan.
4,Great book. Very timely.,"This is a very timely book for the end times. It was written in the 1980's but rings true in the season the Church is in. This book is great to read along with Rick Joyner's other books the The Final Quest, The Call and The Torch and the Sword."
1,There is no hope in Man!,"Having just spent time with the author in his writers conference, I couldReally vent about the disparity of his reputation vs. the mans spirit.I had to leave ASAP both because of his arrogance, and the fact weWe're given the Potter series, the Twilight series ad Stephen King asExamples of great writing and writers to emulate. For God's sake!!!!I guess there are no worthier writers out there to follow....Jesus!I am not taking the Lord's name in vain....I'm praying for all the sheepFollowing this Shepherd!"
5,Understanding the spirit world,I just started reading it and so far it is awesome book. How to understand the spirit realm (demons and angels).
5,Falling deeper into the political rabbit hole.,"Great book discussing the effects of globalization upon the working class in American society. Piven and Cloward effectively discuss the weakening of the working class, the disproportional influence of businesses, corporations, and other capital-holders upon the governing process, the attack upon welfare relief programs, the impacts of poor people's political movements. Piven and Cloward assert that the business class is weakening the civil rights and attacking the relief programs that protect the poor by fueling popular myths about such recipients."
4,"Very satisfied, very good price","The book was in excellent shape and had a great price. I haven't read much of the book since I have been busy, I think the book will be interesting."
3,Sadly disappointed with quality,"This is an awesome artistic depiction of Noah's Ark. Our 3 1/2 yr. old can put this together solo, however, we have been building puzzles with her since she could walk. The problem and the reason for the 3-star rating is simply due to how flimsy these pieces are cut and made. We have a bunch of Melissa and Doug floor puzzles we love, however this thing will fall apart easily by an adult let alone a child. I still have to say that my favorite puzzles are Ravensburger."
2,Disappointing,"Had to press very hard to get the pieces to fit together. Entire puzzle was a bit warped when complete. Most of our puzzles come from the thrift store for thirty or forty cents, so a brand new puzzle should have been a big treat, but this one was just disappointing, especially for my five-year-old. At the same price point, I will stick to Ravensburger puzzles which are thicker and go together beautifully."
5,good first system,"this is my first subwoofer and I'm very satified. I have it powered by a cerwin vega 400.4 amp with 2 channels running 6x9s and the other two bridged at 4ohms running this sub. I don't think I'm running at full power but it still rattles the trunk, vibrates the mirror, and puts pressure on my ears. it doesn't have clearly defined notes but I think that's cuz I have it in a ported box and that's just what you get from a ported box plus my front speakers put out no bass so I'm missing some mids. overall great for a first sub."
1,Poor quality,"I was very disappointed with this product. The zipper broke the first time I used it. After closer examination of the tools, they are of poor quality. I would suggest you look elsewhere for a tool set."
3,Owner,I ordered a dozen of these kits but only received two. I advised Amazon and they said they would send the other 10 kits. After two months I still only have 2 kits.
1,I loved this book before I run in trouble,"I owe this book for four years and loved everything in this book before I run in a trouble. I have followed this book advise for bowel cleansing and injured my colon by using a prescription for cleansing enema, listed in this book. I think author never tried this recommendation on him self and never used it on his patients. Otherwise he would never suggest to other people use this enema recipe and even more on weekly basis. I done it only once and cannot recover already for three months and probably never will. I looked for information on the Web unfortunately after I done this procedure and every piece of information I found says about straining your colon with this procedure. I cannot believe such a prominent doctor would not know that. This make me think this book is dangerous for public."
4,Total replay value...worth the inexpensive price for sure!,"The map is huge, the stunts are rediculously impossible and make the game so fun. The graphics don't awe and even the colors seem overdone and corny. If you want a realistic, strategy sneak around and flip switches to solve the puzzles and then finally after dodging, ducking and hiding kill the 3 bad guys per level then this is not for you. This game requires almost no strategy and is probably easier than it should be, but it is just so fun. I highly recommend you get it. The story is completely cheesy but it is to be expected given the plot of the game. I am not a kid and I advise you to buy this game because the price is low for such a good game."
2,"BLEH, Buy it only if it's onsale.","I bought this game for 22 bucks plus tax and now I feel like I was ripped off. I played the game for maybe about an hour and have never picked it back up. I'm a little disappointed. It's like a crappy, blurry version of GTA, except in the bahamas.Lots of cool stuff to ride on. But it doesn't seem like you could ever die. It feels like the game is made for a little kid. The aiming is pretty much done for you, yet the ability to drive just plain sucks.Not even worth stealing."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"This game seemed like it would be awsome but I found it difficult to control, lacking in story and just kind of annoying to watch. I think that fans of the GTA format of games might like it but it has less story and activitys then even the first GTA for playstation. However I am not the best to judge this game since I am more a fan of KOTOR and Oblivion RPG style games then the GTA format"
2,Holy Crap This Game Sucks!!,"I understand that this game has really good graphics and a huge world, but this game just plain sucks. The storyline is not enticing...I found myself doing the same this over and over and over again. How friggin' boring!! The world is huge, but it all looks the friggin' same! The creators of this game really could have done a better job. I truly recommend that you do not buy this game....it sucks."
3,Not too bad,"The game is fun, but with its lack of direction and lack of things to do, it is too open ended for yhos type of platform."
2,An okay Game,"Just Cause is a GTA-ish type game that is not as good as GTA. I found the game to be a little monotonous and frequently glitchy. There are some cool features in the game such as parachuting and flying a good variety of different planes, and the explorable area in this game is HUGE. To be honest though, I found myself playing it through just to finish it, even though I wasn't always having fun while doing it. If you can get it for under 15 dollars you may be satisfied with your purchase."
2,Disappointing,"As someone who has been in the business for 23 years, I was disappointed with this book. Perhaps the book works well in the confines of a classroom with the assistance of an instructor and some pratical exercises, but for someone looking to learn more about discourse analysis, it was shallow."
4,War History,"Great book, easy to read, A history of one of the last Great Battles of World War 2. Well written."
2,What Ever Happened To Editors?,"The title is misleading; this attempts to be a military history, but the author is clearly ignorant of most things military. He writes a good social history and his personal interview material is good. But when he tries to incorporate that into a larger presentation of military issues, he is clearly out of his league. Corps and divisions are frequently reversed. ""7.62 mm"" weapons become ""76.2 mm"" (there IS a difference!). He looses track of units he was just describing! It is almost all stuff that any decent editor would have caught and fixed and this easily would have gotten one more star, but it sadly appears that editors today are flunkies and morons. And they can't compensate for an ignorant author anymore. In the absence of good editors, this author desperately needed a co-writer."
2,Direct Marketing for Dummies,"The internet section of this book is not at all useful. The techniques are very outdated. For instance, he describes (not in great enough detail to help at all) how to make ad banners. Any marketer with any sense knows that ad banners don't work like they used to. People ignore them, completely. He doesn't give any information about writing copy, or how to approach direct marketing on the internet. He does, however, have lots of ""useful"" information on how to ""get started"", none of which is really useful, since it is all common knowledge. If you've never been on the web before and haven't a clue about business or direct marketing, this book is for you. He gives a great introduction to the web. For anyone with even a bit of knowledge, your way ahead of him."
2,Many mistakes and senseless words,I have the paper version of this book and I love it. When I got my kindle I thought to have the e-version of it and fortunately I had Amazon to send me a sample....I would never buy the kindle version at how it is now. There are so many mistakes and senseless words that of course are not part of the original book. It is just very sad to have this great book in such poor version.
4,Vale la pena.,"En este libro se narra de una forma muy interesante la vida de una familia en particular. Lo que mas me gusto de este libro fue la manera en que la autora describe a lo largo del libro las personalidades de los sujetos envueltos en la novela; que vienen a ser muy distintos y extremos, lo cual, intensifica el drama... Definitivamente es un buen libro y lo recomiendo a todos."
4,Absolutely beautiful,"Wow, the only thing I can say is that this novel is beautiful. Allende plays with the characters of the Trueba family, in which consist of a very sexist family and women who can talk with dead people and all that stuff. She explains a great part of the history of her native Chile with the magic she posses in her words. It is too similar to ""One-Hundred Years of Solitude"" (""100 Años de Soledad""), which IS a better novel, but still interesting(La Casa de los Espiritus). The only problem I find with Allende's writting is that every novel looks like another famous one (just like Afrodita which is compared to a book written by the same author of ""Like water for chocolate""). Although she has lack of creativity in her writings (or lack in innovative styles) she deserves to be in the list of best selling authors. She's got it all. She is a profesional."
1,"This is the ""Cliff's Notes""!","Be careful! The title of this book is misleading. I thought I was purchasing the actual novel ""La Casa de los Espiritus"" but ended up with something like Cliffs Notes."
1,¿Por qué?,"Isabel Allende merece un sitio entre los peores autores en lengua castellana. Sus novelas no son fantásticas, ¡son ridículas! Por ser mujer y por meter a elementos fantastícos premiamos a sus novelas cual si fueran obras maestras. Me gustaría que sus novelas desaparecieran de la faz de la tierra y no por que propaguen ideas peligrosas o subversivas sino porque hacen alarde de una sensibilidad cursi y oportunista a ultranza."
4,The Motherbox indicates that this story is good.,This book was quite good. It was shorter then I expected but it didn't make me feel ripped off. I'm a big fan of Orion and Darkseid. There is a Jimmy Olsen and side group twist to the story which I didn't expect and I haven't read any of the other Fourth World books but it was still a good read on its own right.
4,Cyprus has many secrets,"Have been fascinated by Cyprus for years. This gave a good story line along with geographical understanding and oversight of the people, economy and philosophy"
3,Life on Cyprus--reasonably authentic.,"""Bitter Lemons of Cyprus: Life on a Mediterranean Island"" I'd categorize this book as historical fiction. I almost quit reading it, but I did finish it. I've visited Cyprus many times, and found the book to be authentic."
3,Would not recommend it to anyone.,"To many unknown words, to much rhetoric. Hard to keep my interest.Very slow read & hard to follow at times."
3,wrong part,"Good delivery time. If only the person at Creve Coeur Camera and Video had given me the right part number. Didn't even bother to return it because the shipping price was more than the part. Delivery came on time, and I am sure it's a nice battery. I'll never know."
3,"What did I expect, I guess","I bought 2 of these to replace my aging OEM batteries. One of them has been working very well, while the other won't hold enough charge for more than a handful of pictures. Even if I toss the bad one out, I guess I still got a better deal than buying the Canon batteries."
4,nice ramp,"nice ramp very sturdy rode harley heritage up it into p/u truck. very sturdy. kinda pricey ,but worth it. some things you just can't ""go cheap on"""
3,Wheels are flimsy.,1. The picture shows the paper roll above the art station. Mine did not arrive that way. Mine has the paper stored just under where the two boards (chalk and white) meet. Which would be fine except it makes rolling new paper out tougher.2. The screws provided for the wheels are inferior. When I screwed in each wheel the screw head snapped off leaving the screw still inside the dowel (sp?). I am not a big strong man so I can't say I screwed the screw too hard. It just snapped off like a twig. Cheap screws!I don't usually leave remarks but this is such a large item and kind of pricey so I don't want anyway to purchase this without knowing what they might be getting into.Don't use the screws they provide. Buy your own!All this aside. It's pretty darn cute.
2,Very Disappointing,"We were so disappointed when we received this item, which was to be a Santa present for my two year old grandchildren. The center arrived with a side missing the groove to support the base, which meant we could not assemble it. We had to take it to a carpenter who had a special saw which could cut the groove.Not something which could easily be done one day before Christmas. And no-one has responded to my report of this manufacturing error. I guess no-one will acknowledge this comment either.Shirley"
3,Not Worth the Price:(,I really thought I would love this easel but am so disappointed in the height. I wish it would of been a bit taller than what it is. The other easels are height adjustable and much much cheaper. Don't buy this product it's just not worth it. Mother of three under five :)
2,Hmm...,"Well, besides being very low (not sure how this was meant for kids 7-9 years old - my daughter is 5 and its already up to her chin), it also doesn't go thru the door frame! Whats the point of the wheels if you can't wheel it out of a room??Very disappointed, especially for the price I paid..."
4,Missing paper cutter,Great art center. Daughter loves it. I am just slightly annoyed b/c the description said it came with a child safe paper cutter and didn't find one in the packaging. I don't know if it was supposed to be in there or the description is wrong. I am most annoyed that there seems to be no way to get in touch with Amazon to just get the missing piece without having to return the entire item which would be not worth the trouble. I just want the missin piece! Other than that great.
3,amazon review lies,toy is ok but for price it should be more durable the stars are cheap and can be pulled off by a 2 year old Amazon said that it had a magnetic chalk board it doesn't they lie. its cheap
1,Can not get ahold of this store,I placed my order April 30 and its now June 14thI bought four items and only one made it. The one that made it was a baby doll but they forgot to send the panties that came with it.I have emailed them but no response! I also have tried to call but they never pick up!
2,Gown,"The gown is fine in workmanship. However the cup size seems small compared to the actual size. I wanted to return it, but couldn't get a response from the company. So, I'm stuck with it."
2,"Dry, and not nearly as fun as some of Ms. Tarr's other works","The Hound and the Falcon takes place in an alternate reality in which the kingdom of Rhiyana, somewhere in Europe alongside traditional countries, is inhabited by the faerie folk. The first part of this tome, The Isle of Glass, I read as a separate work. The latter two books bring Alf, our protagonist, first to Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, and then back to Rhiyana and Italy as his heritage is threatened.This book was my nemesis for some time as it took me ages to finish. I was interested in the world Ms. Tarr created, but the story was quite dry and could not hold my attention for long."
4,A fair compilation,"Although a strong compilation of Black Sabbath tracks (only the Ozzy years), with the unforgettable Paranoid, some glaring omissions such as Iron Man, Children of the Grave and NIB make it only a CD for a casual Sabbath listener."
2,very little product for the price,"Very thin cushion. Not much of a seat cushion for $34. One this flimsy could have been purchased locally for about $18 to $20. Very disappointed in the cushion for the price. Hope it stands up to hot Oklahoma summers! This cushion is less than 2"" thick. Stains easily and won't clean. Velcro tabs are a joke. I would have been upset even if I had paid $5. Do not buy. Run away from this product. Amazon should not sell something so poorly made. Worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon or anywhere else. I feel like I was taken."
1,worthless information for perspective travellers,"This video views various aspects of being in Italy - unfortunately, those aspects have little relevance to the average traveller. Planning on test-driving a Ferrarri? Going to have lunch with an artist of dubious skill and look at her studio? If not, this video won't be much help to you. Stick with Rick Steve's tapes. He's a bit irritating, but his tips are superb."
4,A decent little piece of Geek jewelry,"Pretty good item for the money you spend for it. It's a fairly simple piece of jewelry, about an inch in length and fairly light. You can't quite tell from the pictures, but it's missing the back half to allow it to lay on the skin better. That may be a good, or a bad thing for you, depending what you're looking for."
2,guaranteed unbreakable -- NOT,"I got a paid with a bike I bought used. One day, the bike fell over on its side -- a not uncommon event -- and one of these broke, right through one of the forks that holds it on the handlebar. So on that basis, I can't recommend them."
1,Still Itching,its ok and alright and decent and i guess that it did something i dont hurt down there so thats nice
5,Did the job,"It works like any other Monistat cream. I purchased it online because I like to have it on hand, in case I get a yeast infection and it was cheap. When I did have a yeast infection, I used all of the product and my yeast infection was gone."
5,This works!,"Don't believe the write ups that tell you it doesn't work or that it burns. They just want you to panick and spend a lot more on a ""natural"" product that they sell. This is wonderful. Use it and you'll feel better fast."
2,Truth ? Fiction ? or Trash ? step up and pay your money.,"As a collector of this interesting period in history I was hoping with this bookto learn more about the leadership of the SA/SS etc.Instead about a third of this book by Abrams and Lively seems to be taken up witha lot of hot air about current Homosexuality.""In their quest for power, Nazi Homosexuals were no different from today's ""gays"".Then, as now, the stragedy was one of deception, infiltration and subversion"".""Increasingly, as they emerge from the closet, todays ""gays"" do bear a strikingresemblance to yesterdays Nazis"".{I consider that I wasted my money as I do not know whether much of this book is truth or fictionin regard to the Nazi era as the authors have coloured this book with their own thoughts on sexualityin a seeming endeavour to turn 2 books into 1, and in so doing have turned the book into a dog's breakfast}"
1,The Pink Swasticka,"This book is full of hate. It is amazing to me that this author and people like him preach hate and pretend to be Christians, when all they really are, are sad excuses for humans and afraid of their own sexuality. They give Christians everywhere a bad name!"
1,"More than anything else, sad...","At bare minimum this book is thought-provoking. It makes the reader stop to wonder how people could be so hateful as to discredit victims of the Holocaust. It is well known and accepted not only by mainstream society but by academics, historians, and Holocaust victims themselves that homosexuals were persecuted by the Nazis. Not solely effeminate gay men as this book purports, but all. The idea that the Nazi party was formed in a gay bar as this book insists is also ridiculous.I hope that people will not choose to buy this book and give money to a group of people dedicated to revisionist hatred. If you are interested in an accurate account of the experiences of gay victims of the Holocaust, check out Richard Plant's ""Pink Triangle: The Nazi War Against Homosexuals"" or Heinz Heger's ""Men With the Pink Triangle: The True, Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps"". Both of these are excellent, fact based accounts of the atrocities committed."
1,NOT a scholarly work,"As others have mentioned, this is a one-sided piece of far right religious propaganda. Definitely not a piece of scholarly work as it cherry-picks and distorts facts without presenting opposing POV or providing proper historical citations.Also, it should be noted that Scott Lively is a strong proponent of Uganda's draconian ""Kill the Gays"" bill. Also, his organization, Abiding Truth Ministries, has been declared a Hate Group by the SPLC for its continuous spread of anti-gay propaganda, lies, and discredited/refuted ""research"".Do not buy this book as it only puts money in the pocket of a bigot to be used to oppress those he hates."
1,Doesn't even deserve the title of garbage,"This book doesn't to be called garbage, garbage once had some value, either as a container for something useful, or as something useful. This book is homophobic drivel."
1,For Those Who Favor Dogma & Superstition Over Truth,"This book is simply another attempt by crackpot fundamentalist zealots to scapegoat homosexuals. Make no mistakes, this is a work of fiction. These authors take history for a spin and would actually hold homosexuals accountable for their own persecution. Serious readers should skip this homophobic drivel and buy Plant's ""The Pink Triangle."""
1,Homophobic,"Wow! Homophobic, right-winged, paranoid authors. Basically saying that homosexuals were responsible for the evil of the Nazi party. Scary stuff, folks."
1,Misrepresentation of history,"The premise of this book is so faulty that it's laughable. It would be like writing a book that exposes the founders of the Nazi party as men, and then condemning all members of the male gender worldwide as a result. Just because a few Nazi officials were homosexual doesn't erase the fact that the Nazi party clearly targetted homosexuals for extermination. The homophobia in Germany during WWII is well documented, as is the treatment of gays. This book attempts to use smoke and mirrors to trick unsuspecting or prejudiced readers into accepting a completely biased and blatantly revisionist version of history. As an educator who specializes in trauma writing (largely a product of the holocaust), I found this book to be a complete misrepresentation of the information that we know about this period."
3,What is Needed is Objectivity,"Judging from the other reviews, it is clear that people either fully accept or fully reject this book wholeheartedly.""The Pink Swastika"" put forth a thus far unique thesis, namely that the Nazis persecuted only one kind of male homosexual (the effeminate ones), while the other kind (the ""macho"" ones) weren't persecuted at all and some even held high positions in the Nazi hierarchy.As with any new thesis, this one should be analyzed in a scholarly, objective manner, with any and all valid evidence (either pro or con) freely presented, thereby increasing our knowledge of this controversial subject.Unfortunately, the atmosphere on today's university campuses is so characterized by fear of being out of step with political correctness, that no scholar will touch this book (an obvious ""hot potato"") with a 10-foot pole. As far as the politically correct world goes, this book simply does not exist."
1,Fundie Christian propaganda piece. Not to be taken seriously.,"This book covers an interesting topic, that of the place of homosexuality in regards to and within the history of fascism. Unfortuantely, rather than being an exploratory, unbiased account, this book serves as a fundametalist Christian propaganda piece to defame gay and lesbian people. This book seeks to link the Gay Rights Movement with fascism, which is an absurd lie. Just because there are or have been gay people within facist networks doesn't mean that the movement for gay civil rights is a in league w/ fascism.That said, I found this book interesting in that it gives alot of clues to further research."
2,Amazing,"The fact that there is not even a photo for this book, and the fact that it is so hard to find anymore, lends a comical credibility to the authors' points!"
1,Nazis were irrefutably....,"If you guessed Christians you were right! While the co-authors never actually proved their claims, they completely overlooks (for some reason) the unarguable fact that Christians where Nazis more so than gay.This book is propaganda that has already ended and ruined lives. Read with caution. Many quotes are misquoted, many ""facts"" are not facts. Along the same lines we can all remember that Hilter also had Jewish blood."
5,Amazing Story,I read this story when I was younger and thought of it as my favorite book ever since. I haven't been able to locate a store that sells them. If you could help me out email me.
5,Brilliant!,"Brecker was a true artist, a true hero and a great and noble European who upheld the European classical tradition of finding beauty in gorifying the human form. With his work, his inspiration and beauty remains!"
4,worth the money,"I bought this item to hunt with, It seems to fit the flashlight well and I have used it several times since it arrived. It is on a Stinger DS LED. The light out put will be limited to about 50 yards, but i knew that before buying. This product has worked well for me."
1,"Not His Best, Far From It","I wish the book had as much luster as the gold it talks about in the title. Bland, dull and obvious, all that in the first chapter. Based on the outline of the story I thought this would be an interesting book, and I have read some of his World War Two based books before which were ok. Unfortunately, the best writing was on the dust jacket. I got the feeling he just put this together to give him more time to get another of his famous spy novels completed. I would skip this one."
2,It is not that bad at all,"It is a real disappointment as a mystery novel: problem is solved not due to skills/talent/hard work of its hero, but rather by a strike of luck. At the same time it is not so bad read as a non-mystery novel."
3,Foreign Military Spy story,"... It is clear that he reigns supreme of the war spy thrillers. I must admit that this topic does not particularly interest me, however, I wanted to see if this ""king"" of war spy thriller could reach the disenchanted. Well, he was not so gifted. I really could not get with this book. I tried as I wanted to expand my subject interest.After reading the first 20 pages, the author still had not reached any interest in me, therefore, I had to put the book down, never to pick it up again. I am willing to admit that I contributed the largest part to my disinterest, but, the author has to accept some of the blame also. I hope that sometime in the near future (next 5 years) I will be able to pick this book up again and read it in its entirity as I would have grown some. ..."
4,Those Kooky Victorians,"Harriet Ritvo's The Platypus and the Mermaid (and other figments of the classifying imagination) is an interesting look at the Victorian passion for classifying things. The book ranges and prowls over many communities from the scientific to the farmer to the sideshow. This is more about the lack of firm boundaries in Victorian society as science tried to define itself than the author's whim. But the author does handle the twists and turns adroitly. This is a good read and a wonderful look at the Victorian period and what the scientist and the lay person considered important in their need to classify their world, particulary as it grew with the growth of the British Empire."
2,"Overwrought ""Victorian"" nonsense.","I must admit, I truly wanted to like this book. I didn't. A terrific idea for story...a woman who, in theory, is strong and determined but comes off manipulative and selfish. Her life is in reaction to her encounters with various men in her life. Yes, yes...she is tossed to and fro in life (literally and figuratively); she strips away her Victorian veneer (literally and figuratively). She shows real contempt for any and all women she encounters, including her daughter.I read the book, screenplay and saw the movie - as I said, I really wanted to like this book and wanted to understand what I was missing. In the end, I just didn't care about the main character. Her husband's and lover's motives were better articulated...no pun intended.Two stars simply because the concept was promising."
5,Good chair,The chair is very sturdy and is fully adjustable. It lives up to the claims and doesn't move around in the tub and feels very steady when using.
1,Book on familyhood attempts to justify male dominance.,"Straight Talk tries to explain leadership ideas that the author claims will give the reader's family direction, security and happiness. HOWEVER, I found the book to fall short of encompassing any real issues. The book is filled with sexist talk and ideas that come from a disturbingly narrow standpoint. At one point the author refers to a woman's role in society as being analygous with that of a horse with a bit in its mouth."
1,author attempts to explore the male role in familyhood,"A thoughtful and perhaps innovative critique of a male's position in today's society lines the potentiality of this book. Straight Talk tries to explain leadership ideas that the author claims will give the reader's family direction, security and happiness. HOWEVER, i found the book to fall short of encompassing any real issues. The book is filled with sexist talk and ideas that come from a very narrow and culturally biased standpoint. At one point the author refers to a woman's role as being analygous with that of a horse with a bit in its mouth."
1,"nifty gizmo, but waste of space","While this is a nifty gizmo, it is of little use if cooking for a family. It might be worth it if only cooking for two or three people. Most of what should be cooking surface is wasted by a tortilla warmer. I just found that this product was not worth the space it takes up, either stored or on the counter. Its design does allow for somewhat easy cleanup. I do think the person I passed it along to liked it better than I did. Of course she is only cooking for two."
1,No help for broken leg parts- must throw away,"Our new fajita grill came with three of the four legs broken and the grill was unable to stay even without improper support. I called customer service and they told me that they did not have legs but that I might find them at a dollar store or small appliance center. The legs should have been of a durable rubber but were made of a brittle electrician type plastic. They are a specific shape that allows their plug into the above. We have looked and found nothing. So if you buy one, it does take up too much space and the plastic might melt but we need four legs that fit to use ours. This item is made in China so I might have to take a trip there to find the parts. The company should keep a good supply of free legs since this thing has a design flaw."
3,Confusing,"This book could have really used an editor. I assume most doctors frown on home surgery by amateurs and not every doctor can write. I often had to reread portions several times. The content was great, just some very poorly constructed sentences."
4,This is a very useful Resource,"I bought this book in hopes to provide me with useful information, to use in my work at a pediatrics clinic, we are in a very diverse neighborhood. It covers every possible nationality, with brief, very discript information, in an easy to look up format, I've brought it to work to share, and my co-workers, physicians, nurses and others are finding the information facinating as well as providing us with insights to the other cultures that we work with day to day."
5,Helpful information,"Purchased as a quick guide to familiarize myself with diverse patient populations in hospital setting. Information is brief, concise, and informative. Recommend to any social worker or nurse manager to understand why cultures may not agree to modern medicine."
4,One little omission,A useful book for nursing and medical students in dealing with international cultural issues. One glaring omission. It does not cover the topic for the United States! I suspect that it was written by an American for Americans. Might be a good thing to include for future editions.
4,Kindle edition of Mosby's,"Thought I would add a current review for the Kindle addition. Everything as described except that the map images are not viewable on the Kindle. You are able to navigate via the TOC and the Index. Problem with the index is that you are not sure exactly what ethnicity you are being taken to because it indexes different areas as they are mentioned in the text, not just that particula ethnicity. You select the page #, then you must go back until you find your heading. It may or may not be the ethnicity you intended."
4,Good Overall Guide,Handy guide to keep in the clinician's office. This is more of a reference than a must-read type of book. Nice addition to the library.
5,Strong follow-up from Dio era,"This release was the follow-up to the excellent Heaven and Hell. Even though it was released more than twenty years ago, it still sounds better than most of the music that's being released. The band lineup on this one was Ronnie James Dio on vocals, Tony Iommi on guitar, Geezer Butler on bass, and Vinny Appice on drums, with keyboards by Geoff Nicholls. A very tight lineup that also went on record and release Live Evil and Dehumanizer. Standout tracks are ""Voodoo"" and ""The Sign of the Southern Cross"", along with the title track. Very recommended for fans of classic metal."
5,My all-time fav Meal album for starters,"I got this cassette in 1981 and blew me away as a little metal head kid. Still stands up - riffs and lyrics are timeless classics. Get Heaven and Hell too , a must have."
4,Decent Follow-Up with Dio,"This album is good but pales in comparison with 'Heaven and Hell.' Neither the music, lyrics, or recording quality is up to par with its predecessor.It's still a good album with 'Turn Up the Night', 'Voodoo', and 'Mob Rules' probably being the best songs. Yeah, 'Sign of the Southern Cross' is ok but sounds like an inferior version of 'Heaven and Hell' and there you have Dio's silly magic lyrics starting to slip in. I like 'Falling off the Edge of the World' better. 'Country Girl', 'Slipping Away' are OK. Like 'Sign...' with 'Heaven and Hell', 'Over and Over' sounds like an inferior copy of 'Lonely is the Word' from Heaven and Hell.Dio sounds great as always but this album is just not as good compared to 'Heaven and Hell.' Nevertheless, it's still one of Sabbath's best albums."
5,One of the 80s best.,"The 10 best metal LPs of the 80s are: 1)""Mob Rules"" by Sabbath, 2)""Killers"" by Maiden, 3)""Mindcrime"" by Queensreich, 4)""Peace Sells"" by Megadeth, 5)""Day of Reconing"" by Pentagram (analog mix), 6)""Feel the Fire"" by Barnabas, 7)""Fire In the Brain"" by Oz, 8)""Extacy & Danger"" by Ostrogoth, 9)""Cloak & Dagger"" by Witchfynde, and 10)""Under Jolly Roger"" by Running Wild."
4,Underrated,I'm not sure why everyone thinks Heaven & Hell is a superior album. I prefer Mob Rules mainly because its heavier and drummer Vinny Appice seems to have a bit more energy than Bill Ward's work on the previous album.
3,your doctors orders,"Despite Sign of the Southern Cross is ones of Sabbath's best the album as a whole is not one of my favorites, it lacks the edge of previous liricks."
4,"a solid ""sequel""","On it's own the album is very dark and heavy.""Over And Over"" is a bit of a drag but the rest sort of hint at what Dio's solo career would be like.""Sign Of The Southern Cross"" and ""Falling Off The Edge Of The World"" are classics.The title track was great in the ""Heavy Metal"" movie."
5,Mob Rules is one of Dio's BEST!,"The other customer critiques keep implying that ""mob rules"" was good, but not as good as ""heaven & Hell"". I disagree.""Mob Rules"" is one of those unique albums where EVERY song is a listener. I really love the writing, the hooks and DIO's vocals on this album are some of the best tracks he has ever cut!! Period!!If you like DIO's ""holy diver"" solo work, you will like these tracks with a Black Sabbath twist....Buy it and turn up the base, nice moderate tempos with a lot of chunky bottom-end..."
4,A NEAR MASTERPIECE,"Forget the comparisons with Ozzy. Sabbath with Dio is a different band. And it is awesome.Mob Rules and Turn Up the Night are high octane gloom and doom. Ronnie growls through Voodoo and Sign of the Southern Cross, leaving the listener both energized and a little freaked out. A couple weaker tracks at the end (Falling Off the Edge of the World, Over and Over) keep this from being a classic, but overall, it is an incredible experience."
3,solid heavy metal album,"i love the song ""the mob rules"". the rest of the album is solid. not my favorite but a solid three stars."
3,NO OZZY-NO DIO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I cannot believe all this ozzy bashing!!!!! What is wrong with you people? You must not realize without ozzy dio would probably be singing the blues! How can you put a review about ""black sabbath"" and bash the man who made it what it is? You are all posers! And i'm mainly talking about the idiot from tallahasee fl. you must still be a kid and not understand music! Yes this is a great album but nothing beats sabbath with the father of metal! Ozzy is the king! Elvis WHO????????????"
3,Good,"The weakest member (technically speaking) is Sabbath was always drummer Bill Ward. In this CD, he left the band for medical reasons, and was replaced by Dio's pal Vinnie Appice (brother of famous drummer Carmine Appice). He joined the band without trouble, but the band's cretaivity in compositions was already very reduced at this stage... The result is only a few good songs, like ""Turn Up the Night"" and ""Falling of the..."" If you're a true Sabbth fan, you'll realize that ""Heaven and Hell"" is much, much better, and was the last worthwhile Sabbath album..."
4,"Heaven & Hell for singles, Mob Rules for a more complete album","Absolutely love Dio fronted Sabbath, not that I dont love Osbourne fronted Sabbath as well. Its just an entirely different sound, when Dio joined not only was the lyrics heavy but the whole sound finally changed into the heavy metal music we all know and love. I personally prefer Heaven & Hell, but Mob Rules is the more complete album. I really wish Dio and the rest of Sabbath members would have made more music together!"
4,"Not quite as good as ""H&H"", but still mighty fine.","This is about 90% of the record that ""Heaven And Hell"" is, and I love it. On paper, this band shouldn't work, but it does and I return to this version of the band more often than I return to the Ozzy records. The late RJD was a giant among musicians, much less rock singers and he is at his peak on these two Sabbath records. I wish they had stayed together longer, but they didn't, and we have these two great studio records and an uneven live record to show for this version of the band. ( ""Dehumanizer"" was much later and not up to the task, IMHO ) This CD is worth twice the price, easily, and anyone who likes metal should own it."
4,Mob Rules by Black Sabbath,Black Sabbath has always been one of my favoriate groups since day one. Not one of their best albums but still pretty good.
2,A lot of synths but not enough sense,"(2 & 1/2 stars) I bought this CD on a whim, and now I pretty much wish I hadn't. I admit I was suckered in by the sticker on front that reads ""For fans of the Killers, Interpol, the Faint & Depeche Mode,"" and I thought, ""I really like 2 of those 4 bands, so why not give it a shot?"" (The price was also very reasonable in the store.) As it turned out, the reason not to buy is the limp, uninteresting songs, kind of like they took the WORST characteristics of all those bands (and a few others) and put them together. There was only one song on the disc I liked very much at all, ""The Game"" (including its goofy intro). One other tune, ""The Other 90 Percent,"" has a little potential in a fuzzy, J&MC kind of way. The artwork and packaging are also good, but who buys an album just for that? As for the rest of it, the new Action Action CD was a big yawn for me."
3,"take filler songs off the last cd,add 5 more","i forgot about action action making a new cd,i didn't check up on that since october.i was shocked to find out that it was being released today,so instead of being a moron,i downloaded the cd from limewire.i had really high expectations of this cd,the last one didn't leave my stereo for 5 months.summary : there were 5 or 6 filler songs on ""don't cut your fabric..."",the only songs that are worth your listen are Paper Cliche and 120 Ways to Kill You- An Ilustrated Children's Book.Don't Shoot the Messenger and Smoke and Mirrors are ok.the rest shouldn't even be mentioned.just another example why you should stop wasting money on cd's with only a few good songs."
3,Customer review,Useful book for arhcitects and planner. Historical review of station development. Several pictures from British small train stations. For engineer who seeks a typical solutions or pictures do not suggest.
2,too much like a soap opera,I won't be keeping this book in my collection to re-read. It was too much like a soap opera.
4,A good read for when you can't get out to travel as much as you would like to.,"I've read several of Peter Moore's books and have enjoyed them all. Having traveled only a little bit in the areas he covers in this book I enjoyed his insights quite a bit, I also like the perspective of traveling with the GND, it helped make it more real instead of just a series of destinations and tourist details. I also really appreciate how the whole trip is on a buget, it makes everything you read seem within reach instead of some impossible adventure that could only happen the year before college or the year after retirement."
2,you can tell its early!,i like punk rock but i like it even better when i can understand it! I love against me! but the recordings here are not that great it not mixed well and its short. youd be better off getting pretty much anything else by them as i feel this was the weakest cd in their catalog
5,Great book for Japanese names!,"This book is just what you're looking for if you want to find a book of Japanese names along with their Japanese spellings. The book is limited to just the most popular names, so if you pick a name from this book you needn't worry that you'll name your baby some strange name. Nicely done!"
3,Very thin book,"It's a very thin book, which makes it quite expensive for the content. I had expected much more names than what you can find in this book. However, a good start for parents who are looking for a Japanese name for their future baby."
2,Talk about cheap films with a false message,"I can't disagree more with the other reviewers. I didn't buy any thing or situation on this film. The actors do a decent job but that's all.And the excuse of using Plato's texts as a guide on (anyone's) life it's quite simple and a little presumptuous. In my opinion the unbelievable ending doesn't help either too much to dignify the characters. Specially the openly gay Guy.Congrats Regent entertainment and Here! You've finally find the cheapest way of doing films based on plays. I wouldn't compare it with the power of movies such as ""Dogville"" though."
5,The Evidence is In,I am not big on compilations but this is awesome. If you already have the blues or want to get some any of these samplers are a start. Big blues for the buck.
3,Shadowing footsteps,Somewhat satisfying symphony still sounds strangely sterile; despite technical and emotional engagement there just doesn't seem to be much substantial pull.
4,Sweet & Charming,"Reverend Winslow Waldo Wickman has just decided to spice up his image with a new toupe...Olympia de Cuvier still hasn't patched up her relationship with her botanist niece, Annie...and this is life on the small Maine island of Heavenly Daze. But things are not as they seem, for seven wonderful inhabitants on the island are really angels, who help the village in seemingly normal ways but find time to fix less-than-heavenly situations. Gently funny, cutely quirky, and filled with nuggets of wisdom...""The Island of Heavenly Daze"" is a winner."
2,Disappointing,"Maybe I was expecting too much from all the great reviews, but I found The Island of Heavenly Daze disappointingly boring. By the end of the book I had no great interest in anyone's fate, fears, hopes, or dreams - though perhaps that's because no one really had many, as the characters were two dimensional and the plot predictable. It is yet another Jan Karon imitation that wasn't worth the time I spent reading it."
4,"Books, books and more books","The other books in the series were available at Borders store at discount prices. Had to go searching for the first (#1) book of the five. Found it on Amazon and this is where I go to find good quality merchandise at excellent prices. I would use this vendor again; they were timely and priced right. This series starts and progresses from #1 to #5 so I was glad to get the original issue and am able to understand what is going on. Now that the weather is turning cooler (NE) it's time for a good book, a hot drink and a warm blanket; kick back and enjoy."
2,Just can't stretch my suspension of disbelief that far...,"After reading the latest Jan Karon Mitford novel (In This Mountain) I wanted more about God, small towns and interesting people. So I turned to this, the first in the Heavenly Daze series. Sadly, it'll likely be the last for me. If you've read the other reviews you'll know it's about a village in Maine whose residents are aided by angels. Well, for me the concept just didn't come together. The main stories -- Anne and Olympia De Cuvier's struggle to get along and pastor Winslow Wickam' insecurity about his lack of hair and charisma -- work really well as plotlines. Tossing the angels into it turns the book into a silly Disney movie-of-the-week. In the end, I found them annoying intrusions that zapped the credibility of the main stories. And then there's the stuff about Tallulah the dog. It could have been chopped right out and I wouldn't have noticed. Oh well. I'm glad others have enjoyed this series so much."
1,This Wasn't Written by Jordy chandler,"After reading the misleading interviews from my colleagues, i suggest you know that another book is out called ""Redemption, The truth behind the 1993 michael jackson allegations""theat book accurately depicts the eventsas for this book it is HILARIOUS!first ask yourself who is the Authur?a Investigative reporter?Or a Hired Reporter from the father of the boy?investigate the reporterhas no professional credentialsnothingin 99 he was literally banned from publishing an article or book in the united states and United kingdommind you that the child was 17 when this came out and hand no part with the releaseall in all this book was poorly writtenSounds more like a sick love story out of Victor's imaginationdistasteful etc...(...)BR>to me this book was utterly hilarioustheres no evidence whatsoever in it but its good for a laughafterwards i suggest you burn it"
3,"""For My Second Birthday"".","Hello. My name is Luni & I have 18 kids. My 4- year- olds love the SmartVille 1 2 3 treehouse and do not stop playing with it! I live in Idaho & was born on 12/25/ 84. Our treehouse is very odd; it came with pieces that don' t even belong! We found a vulture, a cow, & a pigeon. They don' t belong! My husband, Aberdeen, was going to throw the weird pieces away. But my kids love the weird pieces. We bought our tree house at a garage sale for $38. 99."
5,My Favorite Baby Gifts,"The Smartville line of baby toys by V-Tech are fun and educational, I have purchased several and my grandkids love them. They were delivered right on time and for a better price than my local stores, even with shipping. Couldn't be happier with my purchase."
3,"Stays with other ""unused"" toys","There are many parts to this toy that don't attach well. The little fence was lost within days and the shape sorter was taken off because my daughter couldn't figure out how to put them in because of the awkward angle. The little animals, although it's nice that there are a lot of them, have no place to be stored. I now have to have a specific storage container just for them. As others have mentioned, the ""up and down"" is extremely obnoxious and will override the other songs that are playing and, even worse, the animals have to precariously balance in the swing. We bought it for my daughter who has not outgrown it and my son has now grown into. Being a second child, there are many more options and he rarely plays with this toy even when I bring it out specifically for him to play with."
3,Whistle,With this whistle it's like you have to have it in your mouth just right to get it to really whistle. Sometimes when i blow the whistle you can hardly hear it.
4,Does the job,"I just wish I did not have to blow the whistle with quite as much force. I would like to be able to blow it when I am in the vicinity of others as well as an attention getter and not ruin their ear drums. Otherwise, it does the job and I appreciate the lanyard it comes on. It is ready for use immediately and has a nice cork ball inside.The product also came to my house right away."
1,the whistle that did not work,Amazing how simple a whistle is constructionwise. This whistle did not work. Think hard before buying this junk. Too much trouble to send it back. beware.
5,For School Purposes,I purchased the whistle to use while on duty at school. I love the cord so it stays around my neck and the whistle works great.
5,Nice whistle!,"I bought this whistle to show my son how to blow (to help his speech along) and this whistle worked great! It's nickel plated, so it's not made of cheap plastic. And it makes a nice loud sound too. I have it hanging on our refrigerator door (love that it comes with a nylon cord) and I let my son blow in it once in a while for fun. I plan on keeping it in my purse in the future (for safety reasons). You never know when you will need to catch someone's attention!"
3,could have been so much better,"Great idea, poorly executed.Moving the courser in the delicate manner required is next to impossible. It's jumpy and sometimes takes off on it's own. Sucky control.The video is terrible in the sense that it is always way too dark. My settings are turned as bright as I can get and still there is way too many dark corners in the game where you can't see the clues. You have to just move the courser over the dark areas waiting to see the toolbox pop up - Very poor graphics!Great idea and fun that you can play with others. But so very poorly executed."
4,4.5 Stars,"This is a great game for puzzle lovers and, especially, CSI fans. The game uses the real voice actors from the original CSI TV show. Although the script is overladen with cliche's, the voice acting is excellent. The cases are well thought out and challenging, just like the television show. If only it had more than five cases? Five cases makes the game seem a little shorter. However, each case does take several hours to solve, even for a CSI fanatic. There is little replay value since once solved you know the outcome of the case. This is not your typical console game by any means, a very enjoyable game."
4,Very Easy,Got this game cause I like CSI and EASY Achievement points. Beat the game straight through on ANY difficulty and you get all achievements. This is the first game that this has happened to me. LOL. Game does get a little boring at times but in overall interesting game.
5,love it!,"am i big fan of the csi series so i have to have this game! it shows you where to go the items you get to analyze and all ''that jazz'' the only thing is you only get to play/solve 5 cases and thats it, there's no easy/medium/hard leves is just one level for 5 cases you do get to play partners with the cast of the csi, and interact with some of the same ''suspects'' from the game again in others cases as you move, is great to play at least while it last!, i do recomend it"
3,CSI: Too Easy,"I got several hours of entertainment from this game, but overall, I think its way too easy. Also, once you've completed the game, there's little enjoyment to be found in replaying any of the cases. The nature of the cases ensures that you will get hours of play time. However, they are structured in a very linear fashion, leaving no chance for you to get off track. I'm not a hard core gamer, but even I found very little challenge here."
5,The Dream of the Green Country,"Aestival Tide is a brilliant trip into an exotic future. The language is beautiful, the author uses her knowledge of religion and culture to its full extent, and a very subtle sense of humour runs throughout. If you enjoy spectacle, intricate ceremony, some deliberately over-the-top flourishes, and lyrical writing, this is the ticket. When you read this book, you will know the significance of the Green Country."
5,love my ornament,I have been looking for this one since my granddaughter was born in 2005!! Love it!! Can't wait to hang it on the tree next year!!
5,Echo fuel kit,A great product and arrived quickly. Easy solution to repairing my fuel tank leaking when using the unit....and saved a ton of money.
4,Those Australians are Cool.,"It's 80's for sure, Steve Bisley is to cool, there is a momentary appearence of Mel Gibson, and Roger Ward right? He has arms like a tree trunk...Ward. There are some others from the cast of Mad Max. Toecutter, Johnny the Boy, they're all just regular folk trying to make a living as actors. I wish I had a couple years of Aussie TV to watch here in the US, but this movie gave me a little insite to the""OZZIE-sploitation experience. But I am jaded towards them Aussies. Mad Max series ruined me for life, I'd watch an Aussy soap commercial and be diggin it!"
4,A review of Magic Molecules,"This book is to be commended for its, clarity of thought ,and flowing prose in its treatment of a subject both broad in scope ,and complex in nature. The Author is able to give the reader an accessible overview of the of the most common diseases affecting mankind, and the of the pharmacological approaches used to combat these illnesses in a manner that deftly maneuvers in level from the molecular to the practical. The only reason that I didn't give this book 5 stars is because that I reserve such a rating in this genre for a masterpiece such as ""Creating Mind:How the Brain Works"""
1,fly lookalike,"absolutly nothing is interesting or surprising, or even funny in that so-called ""spy movie"". with such a poor script, it was obvious Doris' carreer was going to decline quickly (and it did). Doris looks lovely in these (still) modern outfits, though her dark sun glasses sometimes make her look like a fly..."
1,POSSIBLY HER WORST FILM...POOR DORIS,"Doris Day's film career took a nose dive in the late 60s, and lord knows it wasn't her fault. CAPRICE may win the title for her very worst film of all time (perhaps a tie with THE BALLAD OF JOSIE?). Why she ever agreed to participate in such a poor piece of garbage is beyond me.If you're a Doris Day fan, stay away from anything she made after THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT. That was the last hit she had, and it's easy to see why those that followed were the kind of clap trap she was forced to do.What a shame."
5,"If it's Doris, it has to be Good!!","I am a true fan of Doris Day and I love everything that she has done!! I had never seen this one before and never really tried to since I had heard all negative things about it, but the other day I decided to try it and order it! I got it and watched it for the first time!!! I LOVED it! I thought that it was very interesting and showed Doris Day at her best!! I really should have known, how can anything Doris Day not be good???"
3,Just ok,I love Doris Day movies and I have all of them. This one was not my favorite though. It had a few screwball comedy moments but this one does not top my list of great movies. I bought it because I had not seen it before and I have all her other movies.
2,um..hmmm,"doris plays a brainless woman who giggles all through the show. she is a very talented actress, but this movie wasn't one of her better ones. the director made her look stupid, and i know she's not. all of her other movies were great."
4,Caprice,"A good movie but not exactly one of Doris Day's best works.....Nice, fun and entertaining....Would not care to watch it that often"
2,Doris Don't!!!,"This is a movie for the rainy (Day) you don't have anything else to watch. Ray Walston is a joy to watch, but you can see how strained Doris is in this movie."
4,really cute,"The willow is a lot greener than the pic implied, but they are really cute, with a very current heel. Also, the leather is soft."
4,Great Resource!,"4 Stars because I use some chords that the book doesn't list. However, I still consider it an essential for any mandolin library.The real treasure for me, however, are the pages of practice tips in the back. They are inspiring and brilliant. They turned around my practice techniques."
4,A great chord dictionary!!,"This book should be intended for any mandolin player who wants to get serious and learn various forms of music. I must say because there is such a big variety of chords, you even have jazz chords. I recommend it :D"
3,"large, pretty, popable","This item is very pretty addition to your room for work outs! However, it's not good for smaller people because it's quite large. Additionally, my rather light friend sat on it and it popped. boo! but it really was the prettiest exercise ball I've ever seen. Not so great for work outs though."
5,A big gold ball. Just as advertised!,"Perfect for people 6-feet or over. Great exercise ball. People need to quit whinning about the included pump. I ended up using my 5-gallon air compressor in the garage (inflated the ball in two seconds), but the included pump isn't bad for a freebie."
5,"Hot sex and deep philosophy, psychedelic wildass bluegrass","I live in the woods in the state next door. This is the real stuff. Not ""southern rock"". Front porch philosophy (the best kind) meets hippie culture, Intricate multiple guitar parts, pretty and nasty at the same time. Fast, the words are very cool, and I won't describe Jim Dandys voice, except it's perfect. As timeless as T-Rex's Electric Warrior, a friend for life."
3,"A printout, not a glossy poster","As I should have expected, this was an obvious printout rather than a glossy poster. The printout was of decent quality, but it was not what I'd hoped for."
2,Too sickly sweet,"Reading this book made me want to crack open my chemistry text. It was so sickly sweet I wanted to puke! I never thought their could be too much sex in a book, but in this one there is. Maybe it's because the only scenes the two main characters have together are sexual encounters. Daffodil Landry has no depth and Hunter James is completely unlikely. These two want to be together the minute they meet. I prefer a little bit of banter and substance in a book. ... Take my advice, save your money. ..."
1,Will not fit aftermarket valve covers!,"These gaskets are intentionally sized 2"" shorter than the valve cover. You MUST have a raised track on the inside of the valve cover to hold it or else you have a rubber band that flies off as soon as you release it. I think Fel Pro is upselling the steel core gaskets at four times the price!"
5,WONDERFULLY ENTERTAINING!,"Welcome to the world of Lisa Scottoline, where the lawyers are anything but typical and little old men fancy themselves as enforcers of family honor....who couldn't love the Tonys, in all of their Italian South Philly glory? Lisa has found just the write blend of suspensful and comedic writing in this tale. Most endearing to me is Judy, that trailblazer of a lawyer who refuses to conform to the rules of socially acceptable ""lawyer behavior"" and dress.The familiar setting that the story takes place in--Philadelphia and its surrounding Western suburbs--is also something that I found extremely enjoyable, being a local reader.Thanks for the gift Lisa....I'm a new recruit and will now be going back to inhale all of your books!!"
2,"Sorry, but I just didn't like it much","From Scottolines first book through to Mistaken Identity, I really enjoyed her work, it was fast, fresh, suspenseful, and at times laugh out loud funny. Her last book was a dissapointment however, and I am sorry to say that this is an even bigger one. Maybe I am crazy, seeing as how it has been geting glowing reviews here, but I just didn't like it. I thought it was very slow paced, and not very suspenseful at all. I found myself constantly skimming ahead for the ""good"" parts. The characters were flat and pigeon Tony was annoying with his constant ""I no murder him, I kill him!"" There were snippets of humor, but nothing compared to some of her previous books. I hate writing such a negative review of an author I like, but that is how I feel. I will still read her next book, and hopefully it will go better."
3,UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!!,"I have read all the Scottoline books up until this one. I Think this one is the most unbelieveable of any I have read. It is very hard to discuss the book and not give away the ending. Judy Carrier is trying to get the jury to believe Anthony ""Pigeon Tony"" Lucia did not kill Angelo Coluzzi. This is after Pigeon Tony admits he did kill him. Go figure. The Coluzzi family trys to get to Judy and attempts to kill Pigeon Tony. The book will hold you attention, I give it that. It is also very funny in places. The names are great, such a Pigeon Tony, Tony From Down the Block and Tony Two Feet. This is so people won't get the Tonys mixed up. I did not like the flashbacks that Pigeon Tony had, supposed to make you know why he felt like he did but I thought they were way to long. Would like to tell you what I thought was so unbelieveabe but would give away the ending to do that. Part of the book was very good but the flashbacks and the ending was a downer for me."
4,The Vendetta Defense,So far this is my favorite book from the Rosato & Associate series. The characters are wonderful and her description of Italians was great!
4,great book,"GOOD FICTION MOB BOOK.LISA SCOTTOLINE IS A GREAT WRITER-SHE WRITES PAGE TURNERS.THIS BOOK IS ABOUT JUDY[BENNIE'S ASSISTANT IN LAW OFFICE] AND HOW SHE HELPS PIGEON TONY IN A MURDER CASE.FRANK ,PIGEON TONYS GRANDSON,BECOMES A LOVE INTEREST.I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW SHE GETS THROGH THE COURT CASE-IF SHE WINS OR NOT-AND HOW THE LOVE INTEREST ENDS,OR BEGINS IN ANOTHER BOOK.I HAVE READ ABOUT 4 OF HER BOOKS-AND STILL COME BACK FOR MORE.HAPPY READING!"
2,Too Much Judy,"I'm a big Lisa Scottoline fan, but this book was my least favorite. Judy didn't interact with her colleagues at the firm, except marginally with Bennie and a phone call or two to Mary. Judy, in my opinion, isn't a strong enough character to carry a whole book. I did finish the book, but it was a bit of a struggle to do so."
2,Yawn,"This was a NY Times Best Seller? It's slow and predictable: A lawyer defends an old Italian man and finds out about past crimes. It's just your same old trial story that has a focus on odd topics: pigeons and revenge. Scottoline is pretty dry and her descriptive paragraphs are flat. If you're going to read this book, borrow it - don't buy it."
2,Not up to Scottoline's standards,"I have enjoyed all of Lisa's Scottoline's books, except this one. And I should confess this review is only about the first half--I abandoned the book when I got to the midpoint and it still wasn't holding my interest. (I almost NEVER do that.) If this is your first Scottoline mystery, and you felt the way I did, please don't give up on her. Most of her books are lively, interesting, funny, and have characters worth spending time with."
2,"""Legal"" Thriller?","""Mediocre"" is the best definition for Scottoline's work. This novel is not her worst, but does not really represent an exception. Scottoline's grasp of Italian culture and history is ridiculously approximate and stereotyped. Her lady-lawyer characters are both boring and annoyingly ""human"", ""correct"" and ""funny"" in the writer's intention.Psichology: zero. Law: zero. Plot: why, if you really do not have anything else to read but the yellow pages and this book, I would advise you to go for the ""Vendetta Defence""."
3,LEGAL THRILLERS 4 LIFE,"Nuthin like a legal thriller. I'm a lawyer and I read this book with my wife nightly. We curl up and kind of lose ourselves in this book. We immerse ourselves from lawyers into a different world where lawyers reign. Legal thrillers. When lawyers get harassed by beasts and stuff. We go, ""WHOOOOO HE GOT AWAY GOOD BECAUSE THE LAWYER IS THE PROTAGONIST AND WE WANT HIM TO LIVE BECAUSE HES A LAWYER AND SO ARE WE"". Im having a child soon and were putting up posters of the Santa Monica Court House in his room. He will love it. We will read legal thrillers to him...legal thrillers.. he'll tell campfire stories at Legal Camp, and they will be scary because we tell him scary legal thrillers."
4,A taut legal drama!,"Lawyer Judy Carrier takes the case of her career when she agrees to defend elderly pigeon racer ""Pigeon Tony"" for the murder of his life-long enemy Angelo Colluzi, on a vendetta that began more than half a century ago, half a world away. The Colluzis want revenge & its up to this gutsy lawyer to secure justice, risking everything, including her life.Lisa Scottoline has written a legal thriller that goes beyond the definition of a courtroom drama. It's a work that defines & distinguishes two almost similar words, ""killing"" & ""murder"", & it is in this background the novel is set. This work once again reaffirms Scottoline's position as the ""Female Grisham.""The Vendetta Defense is a gripping page-turner in the truest sense of the term. Highly recommended!"
4,True to the Cartoon,"Scooby and the gang of Mystery, Inc. are at it again! Stranded in the Southwest when their Mystery Machine once again bites the dust (you'd think as grown-ups they'd have AAA and cell phones by now), the gang finds the locals are being kidnapped by aliens and experimented on before they're returned (safely) home. But are they *really* aliens?If your kids enjoyed the movie version of ""Scooby Doo and the Alien Invaders"" they'll surely enjoy this little paperback based on the movie. The illustrations are bright and colorful and full of energy. My four-year old ""reads"" this to himself and just loves looking at the detailed pictures.If your children love Scooby Doo but you're afraid the movie version of ""Alien Invaders"" might be too scary for them, this would be a nice compromise."
1,"NO: You are wrong, Ralph Reed.","The Christian Coalition, a sub-component of the National Republican Committee, attempts to display their ""impact"" on America. I say this heresay now: That whatever impact, whatever change they have made on America, has intensified their enemies' interests and fascination with the largest Republican organization of America."
4,Great shoes / Great price,"The title pretty much says it all. I was looking for a good pair of Skechers at a fair price.These fit the bill. I looked on Ebay first, and the lowest price on Ebay for these exact shoes was 20 dollars higher then I paid from this seller on Amazon. Seller had Great communications, and shipped VERY QUICKLY."
4,nice shoes,"Really like these shoes, comfortable and plenty wide(I need an extra wide shoe). I wear them on a daily basis."
2,Too big a heal for me,"The shoe has quite a bit of heal to it, much more than I'm used to, so I sent them back. If you like a big heal buy them. They appeared well built."
4,Tough shoe,"Years ago I found the Skechers Afterburn Sneakers and purchased a pair. I wore them out and purchased another. Recently I ordered my third pair. This shoe is a combination of sneaker, walking and hiking shoe. They have an aggressive sole. If you choose the right size (in my case, wide), they are very comfortable. The inner cushioning quickly adjusts to each foot. They wear like iron. I was so impressed I recently ordered two pair, one in white, one in black. My only concern is that much of what was leather in my older shoes is now ""synthetic leather"", a nice phrase for plastic, rubber. I would prefer leather. Added note: it has been one week since I've owned my new shoes. After wearing them once I notice that the stitching near the laces on one shoe is separating. Back they go. Maybe they aren't as tough as they used to be."
5,Skechers running shoe,I have bought 4 pairs of these from Amazon and will continue to buy more. The shoes are well made and inexpensive. I usually wear them out in 2 years. They are comfortable to wear doing anything.
1,Bad shoes,Well to be honest This shoes sucks. I bought this shoes and they even did not last 2 months. so whatelse you want to know about these shoes.
3,delivery of the order of Skechers Men's,"product quality is good, what was I do not agree that the delivery of the order, which was left in the house I had to go find a post office nearest"
4,Holding up really well,"I have had these over two years and they are not falling apart yet. For me, that is a good sneaker since I will go through a lot of them in less than a year. The comfort is good and the signs of wear are not bad. The only issue I have is that they are hard to keep which and clean off stains on."
5,Calificacion de producto,Excelente producto y mucho mejor el servicio de envio... buen vendedor... el articulo llego en condiciones impecables y es como se describe...
4,Good deal for the price,"Compared to other sneakers I am very happy with the price. The product last long and continues to look well. Comfort is OK, but I did start using incerts on the last pair that I bought. I spend a lot of time on cement floors and though shaped well, these sneakers seem to be a little more rigid than other brands. The only other thing is the new pair I just recieved seems to be a little tight even though I ordered the same pair and same size. I am hoping to break them in before they break me in."
2,Tennis Shoes,"Nice looking shoe, but as of yet I am having a hard time getting them broke in. The soles to me are extremely hard not allowing for a lot of flexibility."
1,Poor Quality,"As other reviewers have stated, the shoes are comfortable but the construction is VERY poor. Within one week of receiving the shoes the protective tip on the toe has already begun separating from the shoe. This detracts from the appearance of the shoe and, if it continues to deteriorate, will make the shoe useless within just a few weeks. Do not waste your money. Buy from someone else who can provide a better quality product for your money."
1,Poor Quality,"The shoe is very comfortable but, overall I think that it is poorly made. I have only had this pair of shoes for 3 months now and already the seams are tearing at the top were it lines up with my ankle, exposing the inside material."
3,not as comfy as other sneakers.,"They aren't as comfy as other brand sneakers I got. Hard on sneakers and never bought this brand before, they are hard to ""brake in""."
2,Excessive collar wear,"Within three days of wearing these shoes the vinylish covering around the collar was wearing away, and after a few months now the collars on both shoes are falling apart. Otherwise they are comfortable and wear well, but these are definitely not going to last as long as the New Balance shoes I had previously been wearing. I have seen this excessive collar wear on another person's pair, too."
5,Best sneakers bought in years,I bought these for my husband and scored points with him big time. He LOVES them. He has a bad ankle so it's hard to find something comfortable for him to wear on his feet. These did the trick. The size was perfect and the price was great. I will buy more in the future.
3,Cubre expectativas,"Muy buen producto. Simétricamente bien construido. No sirve para caminatas largas, correr. Es bueno para casi todo terreno. Son rígidos, espero duren mucho."
5,Great sneaker for heavy set people.,"I'm a heavy set guy @ almost 300lb an one problem that I always had was finding affordable sneakers that could withstand my weight. After 5+ months of daily wear (walking an average of 3-4 miles a day) these Skechers to my surprise are barely even broken in. They are affordable, very comfortable and can handle my heavy set frame. I highly recommend these to anyone who is on the plus side looking for an affordable sneaker."
2,Apparel,Sneakers are ok but the tongues four not stay where it belongs. It bunches at the toes. Will not buy again
1,absolutely terrible,bought these shoes out of academy and wore them for about two days and by the end of the second day i couldn't walk because they were so uncomfortable warning to all who buy these beware of the pain.
1,Never to buy Skechers again.,These were the worst fitting shoes I have ever tried. My feet actually hurt after using them for only 1 day at work.
3,WOW are these comfortable,"You can get these with a huge toebox which is very helpfull for many foot and toe problems they are like walking on AIR!!!It gets 3 stars because the Quality of the shoe has gone way down over the years and now within a few weeks of wearing them the outer layer which is the material that has the color on it just seems to peel off,the shoe isnt coming apart its more like if something was painted and the paint started peeling ( just using that as an example they don't paint the shoe :P ).If comfort is what you need I havent seen better as long as you dont care how they look in a few weeks"
3,Great price,"Arived 1 week ago, So far so good, comfort ok, weight good and light, price was fantastic. 1st S purchase usually NB, or N, gona try see longevity. Pleased so far"
5,Afterburn Sneakers,"A favoured style of mine,very comfortable and with the wide fitting provides plenty of side support too,can wear for long periods of time.Having had a good many pairs of these I can say they look nice are comfortable and are reasonably priced,(especially if you shop around............or shopping on line with Amazon,bide your time.4 weeks ago these were $54 now $39 and some change)..............(noticed this after another reviewer mentioned she waited on a different product)................anyhoo,like a white sneaker goes well with blue or black jeans for a casual look.Will buy again."
1,Disappointed,"I love to cook and was looking forward to the ""down home cooking"" recipes. However, I found most contained artifical sweeteners, which I do not use. I was looking for a low fat, healthy cookbook using fresh ingredients. I glanced through about 1/3 of the book and could not find one recipe that I was interested in, so I returned it."
3,Good for Inexperienced Cooks,"After seeing the rave reviews, I was excited to try this new book. Unfortunately, upon receiving it, I was disappointed. I'm an experienced cook who likes a wide variety of foods; this book offers easy recipes, but the variety is limited. At one point, I felt like I had read 10 ways to recreate instant rice!This book would be excellent for new cooks who are unsure of how to combine foods or don't want to take the time to experiment. The recipes are quite easy, healthy and include ingredients almost everyone will have.This book is NOT useful for those of us who know our way around a kitchen, though, or who understand common sense ways to cut down on fatty foods."
1,Not for advanced woodworkers.,"I can not recommend this book to any qualified woodworker. It contains little useful information. The author devotes a lot of space to safety and tools and even spends an entire chapter on workbenches, but the title promises info on designing and building a woodshop. Is this his version of bait and switch? Also, few woodworkers need to be told that a table saw needs space in front and behind for materail handling. And fewer still need to know that a good shop requires adaquate lighting and electrical. Most prospective buyers should get some other book. If you are an absolute novice, then there may be enough ideas here to justify the purchase price."
2,Not all that helpful,"This book had some great pictures and ideas, but little else. It kept saying that the ""ideal"" workshop was different for everybody. That was about the only REAL information it conveyed. I would have liked to see some concrete advice, some do's and don't, maybe even some plans for a really great workbench with notes on how to modify it for your situation. As a jumping-off place for brainstorming ideas, it was fine. As a real reference book, it was just not informative."
1,I returned it.,A rehash of old info - neither interesting nor compelling. Many other books on building your woodshop are considerably better.
3,Fed Up With Toys that Break,"This was the only toy my 5 year old asked for. He was very excited to get this for Christmas.We filled the 2 chambers with ""fuel"" and pushed the lever so it would pump into the main chamber. It worked fine the first time. We tried to use it again a second time and the pump failed to work. The liquid started to drip out the bottom of the chamber. What a dissapointment! The motorcycle itself works great. Don't waste your money buying the lab, you can purchase the motorcycle by itself. Can't anyone make a toy that doesn't break?"
4,Great overall toy,"The toy comes with booster packs that mix with any type of liquid and then it is put into the motorcycle. It takes a little patience at first, but then it works really well. Once the booster packs run out - it still works really well. My son (was 9 when he got it and now he is 10) seems to believe that you need something with a lot of acid in it so he uses lemon and orange juice to make it go faster. The only issue we ever had was that his little brother tried to add some spices to the mix and it got clogged, but we were able to fix it."
1,J-U-N-K!!!,"What a disappointment! What a waste of money! Do not buy this toy, nothing about it worked, we spent an hour trying to get it running (putting it together, mixing indredients, waiting for something to happen)to no avail! The directions were complicated, the mixer was messy and leaky, and the motorcycle did not run, even after a number of battery changes. We are returning this worthless piece of plastic junk. Buyer beware!"
1,STUPID,"this toy is dumb. my brother got it for his birthday. when we put the fule in and turned it on, nothing happen! so i got a screwdriver and took it apart to see what was wrong. i ending up breaking it even more. Don't buy this Toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Bad quality control,Two pair shipped at the same time. One arrived with sharp edges on one temple and one arrived with the right lens out of the frame. Makes me believe that these are a cheap copy of the original or factory seconds.If not then Eagle Eye needs to inspect their products and correct their assembly methods.
4,Impressive,"It took 3-4 days to get used to these sunglasses, as they change the way you see things around you. Once I adjusted, I definitely prefer them to my regular sunglasses.They do reduce the glare quite a bit and are lightweight and comfortable. The hard storage case is great for carrying in my purse, although a little bulky, it is worth the added size to keep them scratch-free.I recommend these sunglasses. Worth the price paid."
2,Manual could be more user friendly/not for younger kids,"When we ordered the Electronic Gadget Lab (which we love, a five star buy IMO), we also ordered the Chem X-1000 to get free shipping. In hindsight, since my daughter is six years old, I'm not sure it was worth it.If you're looking for some fun chemistry experiments to play with with a younger child, perhaps this isn't your best choice. The manual is a lengthy black-and-white single-spaced book with experiments not well highlighted. It goes into great detail for several pages about how to perform chemical experiments in general (which is pretty boring to younger kids).If your child can't read at a higher level they may become frustrated. I have found it's better to dig through it myself first and organize what we'll do ahead of time - something I'd expect the manufacturer to have done when they wrote the manual. For the price and what was included, I am not terribly impressed."
2,Not as good as thought,"This product looks good, but you need to supply so much ingredients to perform experiments it is not worth getting."
2,Not that great,My son lost interest in this very quickly after he got it. Seemed like a lot of work to get it all set up and the experiments weren't fun enough to hold his interest.
3,Expected More,"I like very much Placido Domingo, and the album is good, however not as good as I expected. I felt some enthusiasm is missing."
4,Great item,"ordered one of these for myself, had to go back and order two more for gifts. Great size, great price"
5,Simple yet elegant,"I absolutely love this pendant. I ended up taking it off the chord and put the pendant on a slinky silver chain I owned previously. The bevel in the back of the pendant is not very large so you might want to be careful before removing anything. Its very shiny and sleek, it doesnt look as grainy as in the picture. Very pretty and not expensive making it a great find. My hubby tries to steal it from me constantly."
1,A Total Rip-Off,"I purchased this plan for a small applience I bought through Amazon. When the applience failed, I called them and they refused to do anything because the manufactuer's warrenty had not expired. They also told me that even if I waited until the manufactuer's warrenty expired, they would still not honor my claim because it was then a ""pre-existing"" problem. This is a total rip-off, don't buy it."
5,A classic for any home cook!,"I gave this cook book as a gift to two Khazakstan college students, who are interested in learning to cook the traditional American meals I prepare at home. This book covers them all from meatloaf, mac and cheese to Thanksgiving dinner with all the trimmings. The instructions are easy to read and the color photos are very nice. I recommend this book for any new bride or anyone who wants all the classic American home recipes in one collection."
5,VERY HANDY!!!,My dad had one of these and I HAD to buy my own. Its SO handy to have sitting in the back of your car. In one week our tractor tire was flat as well as my jogging stroller tire. They were fixed in a matter of minutes and all is well in the world. Definitely something to own!
4,Just what I wanted.,This is a gift for my husband. He has physical problems and isn't able to change a tire. This should make him more mobile. Bag zipper was broken though.
4,smart spair,"I received the package promptly, as described. It is compact enough to fit in one of the compartments in the back of my Subaru, I have not used it yet, but it seems to be fairly well made."
3,Buy Dirty Pretty Things Instead,"If you like the Libertines, get the Dirty Pretty Things Album instead, which is manned by the other Lib's frontman.Only one (maybe two) OK songs on this album. The rest is filler. I kind of think of Pete D. as a UK version of Paris Hilton--famous for being famous. If Pete were not heading Babyshambles, nobody would ever buy this album."
3,really disappointing genius 3 and a half stars,"I'm not sure if I would listen to this album at all or if I would absolutely love it if Peter Doherty had not been in the Libertines. The fact is he was and I loved the band, so I can't seperate the two. There are some brilliant moments on this album and at points it even benefits from the new band, see the song Albion, but over and over a brilliant song becomes mediocre due to sloppiness in craftsmanship and production. I can't believe Mick Jones didn't walk out on this album. It is not raw; it is sloppy. Minor changes and a few more takes could've made this album great. Doherty's genius shines through at many moments, but it only makes the sloppiness of the album that more disappointing."
